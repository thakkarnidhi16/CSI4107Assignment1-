<HEAD>Radical Priest Accuses Church of Plotting His Ouster</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Activist priest Jean-Bertrand
Aristide on Wednesday accused the Roman Catholic Church of plotting
his ouster and also warned of popular unrest unless the Haitian
government made democratic reforms.
   In a message transmitted over private radio and television
stations, Aristide attacked the hierarchy of Haiti's Roman Catholic
Church for not speaking up against an order to transfer him to
Canada.
   Thugs attacked Aristide's St. Jean Bosco Roman Catholic Church on
Sept. 11, killing 13 worshipers and wounding many more. It is
believed the church attack was responsible for Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy's overthrow as Haiti's leader shortly after. Rank-and-file
soldiers said they were tired of state-sponsored violence.
   Wednesday was the first time Aristide spoke out publicly since
his Salesian Order superiors in Rome ordered him to leave Haiti on
Oct. 17.
   The order prompted demonstrations by his followers and Aristide
remains in Haiti. The Salesians have not acted since giving Aristide
the October deadline.
   ``You are plotting against me, give me a chance to look at you
straight in the eyes,'' Aristide said in his eight-minute message to
Haitian bishops. The speech was transmitted by most radio stations
except church-operated Radio Soleil.
   Aristide also lashed at the bishops for ``never commenting on the
order to transfer me.''
   He also warned Lt. Gen Prosper Avril, the Haitian president, to
``make a purge in the country and stop the uncertainty'' by Nov. 29
because ``the people are watching over you.''
   Avril came to power in a Sept. 17 coup staged by non-commissioned
officers who overthrew Namphy. Avril promised democratic reforms,
including municipal and legislative elections.
   On Tuesday, Avril declared Nov. 29 a national day of mourning for
dozens of voters massacred at polling stations nearly a year ago by
armed thugs.
   Aristide accused Avril of ``playing like Francois Duvalier,'' the
late dictator, by calling for elections before bringing to trial
those known to have carried out atrocities such as the Election Day
massacre. Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude ruled Haiti for 29 years.
   Aristide charged Avril's government had not cracked down on the
remaining Tonton Macoutes, the feared secret police of the Duvalier
regime, and brought them to trial.

   The arm of a fast-spinning carnival ride
collapsed at a county fair Wednesday night and sent one of its cars
flying into a crowd, killing a teen-age girl and injuring six other
people, authorities said.
   The Broward County Fair ride, known as the ``Giant Octopus'' or
``The Spider,'' has eight arms, with three pods on each capable of
holding six passengers. One arm broke in half and came crashing to
the ground.
   Christy Schafale, 17, of Cooper City was struck by a car from the
ride and died of head injuries at Humana Hospital-Biscayne in Miami,
said police Detective William Garrett.
   Four others were taken to the hospital, and three probably would
be discharged Wednesday night, said Dr. Don Nessley. The fourth,
23-year-old Christopher Burch, was listed in guarded condition.
   A mother and her 12-year-old son were treated for lower back pain
and discharged from Doctors General Hospital in Hollywood, said
Robert Miller, an emergency room nurse.
   Fair officials report that all of the rides were inspected Nov.
16, the day before the fair opened. The fair runs through Sunday.

   Slashing across Florida's midsection from
coast to coast, Tropical Storm Keith blew northward into the
Atlantic on Wednesday, leaving damaged homes, eroded beaches and up
to 6 inches of rain.
   Disaster-preparedness officials reported no major damage or
injuries from the late-blooming storm, which generated winds up to
65 mph in a path ranging from the Sarasota area on the Gulf Coast to
Cape Canaveral on the east.
   The space shuttle Atlantis, perched on its Atlantic seashore
launch pad, was unscathed and the storm will have no impact on its
scheduled Dec. 1 launch, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone. Workers
mopped up rainwater that blew into its aft compartment.
   Schools were closed in three counties. Red Cross officials said
more than 500 residents of low-lying areas along the Gulf Coast
returned to their homes Wednesday after spending the night in
shelters.
   ``Keith was just below hurricane strength, and, as we thought,
the main problem was coastal erosion,'' said Bob Sheets, director of
the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Now it's going out over
the Atlantic ... it's not going to intensify it's going to just keep
moving. Bermuda could get some tropical storm conditions over there,
so we're keeping an eye on that.''
   At 11 p.m. EST, the center of the storm was near latitude 29.9
north and longitude 76.7 west, or about 725 miles west-southwest of
Bermuda, moving east-northeast at 20 to 25 mph with 50 mph winds on
a track that could bring it to Bermuda by Thursday afternoon, the
center reported.
   The storm was blamed for several tornadoes, which damaged mobile
homes, and for the derailing of 20 train cars near Lakeland when the
railroad bed was washed out by heavy rains.
   The derailment ruptured a natural gas line and forced the
evacuation of 450 people from a one-square-mile area. No one was
reported injured. The gas dissipated and most people returned to
their homes by early afternoon, Polk County officials said.
   A tornado struck two mobile home parks near Leesburg, in Central
Florida, on Tuesday, causing ``slight-to-medium damage'' to about 25
trailers and several vehicles. No one was injured, said Bob Reymont,
Lake County director for emergency management.
   Keith stormed ashore after midnight near Sarasota, which ``may
have experienced the most substantial damage,'' said Dick Morgan of
the state Division of Emergency Management.
   Sand blown by Keith was up to the doorknobs of some beachfront
motels in Naples on the Gulf Coast, and workers with bulldozers and
shovels began the slow task of digging them out Wednesday.
   But other Naples residents said they never felt a thing.
   ``We slept through the whole thing _ we could hardly believe
there was a storm at all,'' said Mary Joe Park.
   The storm's exit from the state near Cape Canaveral was
accompanied by 35 to 45 mph wind gusts and heavy rains, causing some
temporary road flooding and downed trees and power lines. But most
central Florida residents made light of it, with one comparing it to
a sudden summer thunderstorm.
   ``For once, the weather did us a favor,'' said Orlando-area
citrus grower Jerry Chicone Jr.
   ``We got about six inches of rain, which was much needed. It
prepares us for the winter season. And the winds weren't strong
enough to do any tree damage,'' Chicone said. ``So it was very
positive for us here.''
   Tampa, Orlando, Daytona and the Cape Canaveral area reported from
5 to 6 inches of rain.
   Orlando airport spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell reported no undue
delays in air traffic. Disney World spokesman Jim Hampton said Keith
did not alter the operations schedule at the large tourist
attraction. And the Florida Highway Patrol's Randy Harper said
Central Florida roads suffered no major problems.

   Every day is Thanksgiving Day at the
Rainbow Kitchen, one of hundreds of American soup kitchens where
hunger never takes a holiday.
   ``These people need help year-round, not just during the
holidays,'' Kevin Amos said as he stocked the Rainbow Kitchen's
pantry with canned goods.
   ``This is one of those thousand points of light (President-elect
George) Bush talks about,'' said Bob Anderson, a former steel
worker. ``But there's no reason this kind of charity should have to
exist. We just keep going because we don't want to see people turned
away.''
   Anderson opened the Rainbow Kitchen in 1984 after the sharp
decline of steel and heavy manufacturing left thousands jobless in
Homestead, a historic steel town adjacent to Pittsburgh.
   The Rainbow Kitchen is one cog amid all the soup lines, food
banks, churches and senior citizen centers nationwide that make up
an ever-growing, mostly volunteer and imperfect machine that
distributes millions of pounds of free food every year.
   ``We never thought we'd be in operation this long,'' Anderson
said. ``The number of people we serve just keeps growing and
growing.''
   Homestead's Eighth Avenue bustled when U.S. Steel's sprawling
Homestead Works was turning out giant steel slabs into the early
1980s. But the mill is cold and shuttered now, and business on the
avenue is slower.
   At noon each day, a quiet line forms outside the Rainbow Kitchen,
where hot lunches are served to an average of 185 people.
   ``We get a mixture of people,'' Anderson said. ``It used to be a
lot more unemployed people. I think now it's more underemployed
people. I see more children than I'd like to see here. We get whole
families.''
   One recent chilly afternoon, Sharon Fischer, 25, expressed
gratitude as she and two of her three young children munched on
hamburger patties, pasta and potato salad served on plastic plates.
   ``I'm not ashamed. I'm not rich,'' she said. ``This is decent.
They make sure you're full when you leave.''
   Ms. Fischer, single and unemployed, said she has looked for work,
but ``they aren't hiring.'' She said she can't get by on food
stamps, so she eats at the kitchen several times a week.
   Anderson operates the Rainbow Kitchen on $125,000 a year. Most of
the money comes from small donations, although rock star Bruce
Springstein donated $10,000 in 1985.
   ``Sometimes we run out of food and just hold up the line,''
Anderson said. ``We open up some big cans of beans or something and
just start making sandwiches like crazy.''
   Every Thursday, the Rainbow Kitchen opens its pantry to about 700
families who are given a bag or two of groceries.
   Since 1980, changes by Congress and the Reagan administration
have narrowed eligibility for food stamps and therefore reduced the
amount going out. Last year, the federal government spent $10.59
billion for food stamps, compared with $11.98 billion in 1980,
according to Census Bureau figures adjusted for inflation. In that
time, the number of people receiving food stamps declined by about
900,000, the Census Bureau said.
   In roughly the same period, from 1979 to the present, the number
of people living below the poverty line of $11,600 annual income for
a family of four has grown by 6 million, the government reports.
   Many people eligible for food stamps either don't apply or are
wrongly rejected, according to Robert Fersh, executive director of
the non-profit Food Research and Action Center in Washington, D.C.
   On average, food stamp recipients each month get stamps worth
about 54 cents per meal, although Fersh said some elderly
individuals get as little as $10 a month. It's therefore no surprise
many run out of money at month's end and turn to pantries and soup
kitchens for help, he said.
   ``The number of people needing food by the end of the month has
risen,'' Fersh said. ``The people who rely on the safety net not
only have had food assistance cut but have to pay more for medical
care and utilities.''
   Annual surveys by the U.S. Conference of Mayors reveal a steady
increase in the need for emergency food, said Laura Waxman,
assistant executive director of the group.
   A survey of 26 cities found two-thirds of those who needed food
in 1987 were families with children, she said.
   ``You think of the traditional soup kitchen user as the single
man or the single woman, but we know there are more and more
families,'' Ms. Waxman said.
   The heart of the nation's grassroots food distribution is the
Second Harvest National Food Bank Network, which began in 1979 in
Phoenix.
   Last year, Second Harvest, now based in Chicago, distributed
about 387 million pounds of food. Its 205 affiliated food banks
served 38,000 local charities, including pantries, soup kitchens,
shelters, and day-care and senior citizen centers.
   Yet the need for more food is constant.
   ``What I generally hear are stories of a food pantry that is so
strapped for food and money that it is only able to supply three
days' supply of food per family per month regardless of the depth of
the family's need,'' said John Arnold, public policy manager for
Second Harvest.
   Many of the nation's food banks started in church basements with
one vehicle to haul food, but the average food bank today has
several trucks and handles 3 million to 6 million pounds of food a
year, Arnold said.
   The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank boasts a
160,000-square-foot warehouse in nearby McKeesport that was bought
after a fund-raising drive led by two local banks. In 1987, the food
bank distributed about 7.3 million pounds of food to about 300
affiliates, including the Rainbow Kitchen, said Executive Director
Joyce Rothermal.
   More than half the food bank's supplies are donated by Second
Harvest, grocery stores and individuals. Some are bought with state
money, a small portion with federal money and the remainder with
food bank money.
   ``There's a group of people who are really bad off,'' Ms.
Rothermal said. ``It's falling to the private sector to help them.''
   Harry and MariAn Halt of Homestead, who have a teen-age son and
daughter, were among those crowded into the Rainbow Kitchen on a
recent Thursday waiting with paper bags and carts to pick up a slab
of butter, a carton of eggs and other groceries.
   ``We usually make the food stretch, but we sometimes get a little
close,'' said Halt, 47. He said heart problems forced him in 1986 to
quit his job as a caseworker for the state Department of Welfare.
   ``I don't know what we'd do without these food banks,'' Halt said.

<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. has agreed
to pay $180 million in compensation to victims' families and
survivors of the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster.
   Lawyers for the families of 126 of the 167 people killed and for
50 of the 62 survivors of the July 6 fire in the North Sea said they
will urge their clients to accept Tuesday's offer from the Piper
platform's U.S. owner.
   A source close to the negotiations said the average payment would
be $1.08 million for each family.
   ``Some will receive payment before Christmas,'' said Occidental
spokesman Alex Blake-Milton.
   Some of the remaining families planned to sue Los Angeles-based
Occidental in U.S. courts, where they believe they may get larger
sums and see the disaster investigated more thoroughly than in
Britain.
   It was not known how many families or survivors would sue.

   East Germany's dispute with the Kremlin over a
reformist Soviet magazine intensified when Radio Moscow defended the
publication as mirroring a ``plurality of opinions in the Soviet
press.''
   In a related development on Tuesday, a West German newspaper
reported that East German authorities have pulled five
anti-Stalinist Soviet films from theaters around the German
communist state.
   On Saturday, the East German Communist Party newspaper Neues
Deutschland said the government in East Berlin had suspended
delivery of Sputnik, a Soviet periodical that contains a selection
of articles from the Soviet press.
   Neues Deutschland charged that the magazine's articles ``do not
contribute to cementing Soviet-East German relations and instead
contain articles that distort history.''
   In recent issues, Sputnik has carried articles containing frank
appraisals of the Stalin era, along with letters and commentaries
critical of Kremlin policies.
   Radio Moscow's German-language service, heard in Berlin, on
Tuesday said the ban resulted from a misunderstanding.: ``Here at
the editorial side of Radio Moscow we have understanding for the
motives which have been given for this decision.
   ``But we believe that in this case there is a misunderstanding.
The publication of the magazine Sputnik ... only mirrors the
plurality of opinions in the Soviet press. ... We hope that this
regretful incident will be settled over time,'' it said.
   The West German newspaper Die Welt said East German authorities
have pulled five anti-Stalinist Soviet films from theaters in East
Germany.
   Die Welt said the order came from the East German Culture
Ministry and took effect on Saturday. The newspaper did not identify
its sources.
   East German leaders have resisted Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, contending that a such
critical discussion of problems in East Germany is unnecessary.
   Gorbachev enjoys enormous popularity among East Germans, who hope
the Soviet leader's influence will bring about similar reforms in
their country.
   In recent months, East German authorities have cracked down on
the nation's Lutheran Church press, censoring or banning
publications dealing with human rights issues.

   South Korean feminists have begun a
weekly newspaper called ``The Women's News,'' and its publisher says
its mission is ``breaking down the predominantly patriarchal nature
of Korean society.''
   The 24-page tabloid, coming out Friday, will carry the slogan
``Of the Women, By the Women, For the Women.'' Publisher Lee
Kye-kyung said it is the first commercial journal of feminism
published in South Korea.
   Women have been isolated, dehumanized and politically powerless
in Korea's 5,000 year history, largely due to Confucianism, Ms. Lee
said.
   She said the paper will cover ``women's environments, from
environmental contamination, wife beating and sexual abuse to
resources, the anti-nuclear campaign and consumer's protection.''
   The magazine was founded in August at a meeting attended by 600
feminist supporters, including women's studies scholars, housewives,
students, media personnel and some men, she said.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With unemployment the highest in Western
Europe, Spain's Socialist government and labor unions, longtime
allies, are on the verge of a serious split.
   When leaders of Spain's 100-year-old General Workers Union called
recently for a nationwide strike to protest government economic
austerity policies, they took what many saw as the final step toward
a divorce from the governing Spanish Socialist Workers Party and the
46-year-old Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   The union and its erstwhile rival, the Communist-oriented Workers
Commissions, have set a 24-hour nationwide strike for Dec. 14.
   The aim of both unions is to force Gonzalez, a former labor
lawyer, to shift his support to labor and drop policies favoring
only moderate wage hikes and low inflation as the way to high
economic growth.
   Labor Minister Manuel Chaves' decision to create a youth job
corps was the last straw for the unions, who claim the low wages
proposed in the plan will take jobs away from older workers at a
time when the unemployment rate has soared to 18.8 percent.
   The youth plan calls for the creation of up to to 800,000 jobs
for unemployed youths 16 to 25 years old over the next three years
through low wages and tax credits for businesses who must provide
training during their six-to-18 month contracts.
   At least 45 percent of those in the 16-25 age group are
unemployed and many have never held a job.
   Apolinar Rodriguez, member of the General Workers Union executive
committee, said the program ``foments inequities among workers since
youths hired under the plan will be making less than the minimum
legal wage'' _ the equivalent of $376 a month for those aged 18 to
25 _ ``and will be excluded from collective bargaining agreements.''
   Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga reponded, however, that the
unions may find the majority of Spaniards do not share their
disapproval of the youth jobs program.
   Even before the jobs plan conflict, the unions had clashed with
the Gonzalez government over wage agreements.
   Union leaders have denounced the government's request that
employers reject demands for immediate wage increases until after
the first of the year, despite a recent rise in inflation to 5
percent, two points above the 1988 government target.
   Nicolas Redondo, secretary general of the General Workers Union,
helped propel Gonzalez to the top of the Socialist party during the
bitter years of the opposition to the authoritarian regime of Gen.
Francisco Franco. But Redondo quit his Parliament seat in 1987 to
protest a budget he viewed as anti-labor.
   ``The strikes are not just about money, but about ideology,''
Redondo said recently. ``The economic policies of this government,
instead of helping workers, lean clearly to the right. It should
realize it cannot remain in power very long with just the support of
businessmen and bankers.''
   The Spanish Confederation of Employers has given its full support
to the youth plan and backs continued government calls for moderate
wages.
   The economic policies criticized by the unions have helped end a
decade of economic stagnation in Spain and spurred a boom that has
fueled a 5 percent annual growth, the highest in Western Europe, for
the past two years.
   A top Labor Ministry official, Alvaro Espina, has criticized the
unions' opposition to the jobs plan, saying they appear more
interested in politics than helping youths get jobs.
   Espina lamented the growing separation between the unions and the
Socialist administration ``which diminishes their (the unions') role
in society, which is absolutely necessary and which should be
reinforced.''
   Only 10 percent of Spain's active work force belongs to a union,
according to Labor Ministry statistics, and the government appears
confident of public support for its jobs plan.
   A government poll recently indicated that 85 percent of those
surveyed believed the administration's top priority should be
creating jobs for youths.
   An additional 77 percent said they preferred that the government
create the jobs through incentives to businesses rather than
directly hand out unemployment pay.

   A man who had nearly 100 people chasing
windmill dealerships has pleaded guilty to fraud.
   Joseph Leo Romah, Jr., 30, of Pittsburgh, pleaded guilty Tuesday
to 13 counts of mail fraud and two counts of interstate
transportation of fraudently obtained securities.
   Prosecutors say Romah operated Riggs Wind Energy Systems in
Carnegie from January 1983 to September 1985 and made false
representations regarding the ability of the company to provide
tested windmills, most of which were ostensibly to be used for
dealerships.
   The government said 74 people paid Romah more than $340,000 in
dealership fees and 20 people paid more than $140,000 in deposits on
the windmills.
   He entered his plea after a week of trial in which the government
had presented 20 witnesses.
   Romah faces up to 85 years in prison and a fine of $570,000.

<HEAD>Mexico, U.S. To Hold December Meetings On Foreign Debt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mexico and the United States will begin
cabinet-level talks in December to seek new ways to alleviate
Mexico's foreign debt and free money for growth, President-elect
Carlos Salinas de Gortari said.
   The talks will begin shortly after Salinas takes office on Dec. 1
and well before President-elect George Bush's Jan. 20 inaugural,
Salinas said Tuesday during a flight from Houston after a meeting
with Bush.
   The talks will involve the two nation's treasury secretaries.
Salinas has not yet announced his Cabinet, but his top adviser at
Tuesday's meeting, Jaime Serra Puche, is rumored to be the leading
contender for the job.
   Bush has already said that he will keep Nicholas Brady, President
Reagan's treasury secretary, on the job.
   Mexico's foreign debt now stands at $102 billion, and interest
alone this year is $9 billion. Salinas said that in his meeting with
Bush, he stressed the need to reduce the flow abroad of capital
needed for domestic development.
   Salinas said Bush brought a positive and cordial attitude to the
meeting, which took place Tuesday at the Johnson Space Center. It
was the first time he and Bush met, and he said he hopes to meet
Bush at least once a year.
   The two men also discussed drug trafficking, immigration and
commerce. Salinas said he stressed the need to safeguard the human
rights of Mexican workers in the United States and asked for easier
access for Mexican products to the U.S. markets.
   ``I am absolutely confident after this initial visit that we're
both committed to improving a bilateral relationship that is
essential, in my view, as far as the United States of America is
concerned,'' Bush said in Houston.
   Salinas told reporters on the way back from Houston that based on
the meeting, ``I expect a much better relationship.''
   Both termed good relations ``essential'' to the well-being of the
two countries and acknowledged their two most important bilateral
problems _ Mexico's foreign debt and drug trafficking from Mexico to
the United States market.
   ``They (the United States) will work on the problem of
consumption and Mexico will fight trafficking,'' Salinas said. Drug
trafficking has been a sore point in U.S.-Mexico relations, with
U.S. officials often charging that Mexican officials' corruption
facilitates the drug trade.
   In a joint communique, the two presidents said they recognized
that ``the solidarity and understanding of the United States is
essential'' if Mexico is to find ways to grow economically.

   It was the evening of David Hibbard's last day
as a Peace Corps volunteer in a mud-hut village in Nigeria when his
overseas radio crackled with the bulletin that John F. Kennedy had
been assassinated, and Hibbard's lonely nightmare began.
   ``I felt an overwhelming sense of loss and grief,'' said Hibbard,
now a doctor in Boulder, Colo. ``I stayed up all night listening for
details. I wondered irrationally whether he might have lived if I'd
stayed in Nigeria another year. I cried myself to sleep, exhausted.''
   Jim Hagan of Santa Cruz, Calif., recalls he was a youngster
trying to hitchhike out of a blizzard in Buffalo, N.Y., to attend
the president's funeral in Washington. He never made it, but he
joined the Peace Corps three years later for a stint in India.
   Kennedy, said Hagan, embodied the Peace Corps' ideal of ``helping
others, breaking down barriers ... and promoting peace instead of
war.''
   Hibbard and Hagan were among 450 former Peace Corps volunteers or
their surrogates who saluted Kennedy's memory during a 24-hour vigil
in the Capitol Rotunda which ended at midday Tuesday, the 25th
anniversary of the president's murder in Dallas.
   They joined hundreds of other former volunteers at a memorial
Mass at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral, where the Rev.
Theodore Hesburgh recalled Nov. 22, 1963, as the day when ``the
heartbeat of a nation stood still.''
   Americans across the land stood still for a moment Tuesday to
recall that dark day, although members of the Kennedy family said
they hoped the president could be remembered for his life, not his
death.
   ``I think we should think of the high points of his life, the
laughter and the vision,'' said Eunice Shriver, the president's
sister, who made an early-morning visit to his grave at Arlington
National Cemetery. ``Hopefully, someday we'll get excited about his
birthday.'' Kennedy would have been 71 last May 29.
   Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel, appeared shortly after the
cemetery gates opened at 8 a.m. Later in the day, Evelyn Lincoln,
the president's personal secretary, laid three red roses before the
eternal flame. She has visited the site every Nov. 22 since the
assassination.
   Thirty uniformed men of the Army's elite Green Berets laid a
wreathe, formed a semicircle and saluted their former commander in
chief.
   The president's youngest and only surviving brother, Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., laid a single white rose at the Kennedy
memorial at Runnymede, England, where King John made a historic
grant of civil and political liberties in the Magna Carta.
   ``We think it's extremely important to celebrate the life of
President Kennedy rather than the tragedy,'' Kennedy told reporters.
``We're focusing on the birthday and the hope of his life rather
than dwelling upon his loss.''
   A private Mass was held for the president's widow, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis, and her two children, John Jr. and Caroline, at St.
Thomas More's Roman Catholic Church in New York City. The former
first lady made no public appearances.
   In Dallas, no official ceremonies were held, but about 2,500
people gathered at Dealey Plaza to pray silently and observe the
site where Kennedy was killed by an assassin's gunfire as he waved
to crowds from the back of an open limousine.
   Twenty people clasped hands along the motorcade route. A crucifix
and two bouquets of flowers were left at the approximate spot on Elm
Street where the president was struck. Notes attached to the flowers
read ``We still miss you _ Nov. 22'' and ``After 25 years, we still
love you, John.''
   Schoolteacher Jean Hill, who witnessed Kennedy's murder a
quarter-century ago, brought her 50 third-graders to Dealey Plaza.
``I want my kids to know it does not take violence of any kind to
bring about change and that they themselves can be instruments of
change and it can be good,'' she said.
   Some cable television viewers relived the hours after the
assassination as the Arts & Entertainment channel interrupted its
regular programming and played NBC News' actual coverage of the day
minute-by-minute exactly 25 years later.
   It started at around 2 p.m. just after the bullets were fired and
ended in the evening with events in Washington after President
Lyndon B. Johnson landed in the presidential plane that also brought
Kennedy's body and widow back to Andrews Air Force Base outside the
capital.

<HEAD>Drought Rocks 1988 Economic Forecast, Boosts Budget Deficit
Projection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration says last summer's
drought took such a large bite out of the economy that it will add
about $3 billion to the reductions needed in next year's federal
budget deficit.
   Joseph R. Wright, director of the White House's Office of
Management and Budget, said in an interview Tuesday that the
administration now believes the fiscal 1990 deficit will have to be
slashed by about $35 billion to comply with federal law.
   He said that in the 1990 budget the administration currently is
writing, about $15 billion in reductions probably would come from
various benefit programs for the sick, farmers, federal retirees and
others who automatically qualify for government help.
   He said the rest would come from a combination of reductions in
other federal spending, sales of federal assets and increases in
user fees.
   The 1990 budget year begins next Oct. 1.
   He insisted there would be ``no new taxes,'' although there have
been disputes in the past between the Democratic-controlled Congress
and President Reagan over whether some of his proposals for new
revenues should be called tax increases.
   Wright also said Social Security would not be cut, and that
defense programs would probably receive a slight increase over the
inflation rate. Military spending eats up about 30 percent of this
year's $1.1 trillion budget.
   ``It is a conservative budget, and I think that's what Ronald
Reagan should leave as his legacy in his last budget,'' Wright said.
   He said the spending blueprint so far had no input from
President-elect George Bush, but that the vice president easily
would be able to adjust it to his own priorities once he takes
office.
   Wright said the administration now believes the deficit for
fiscal 1990 will be $135 billion, or $3 billion higher than
previously forecast. The Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law requires
a shortfall of no more than $100 billion next year, with billions in
across-the-board spending cuts the consequence if the target is
breached.
   Wright said the budget would achieve the $100 billion target.
   He also said Reagan had declared that cuts should not be made in
benefits received directly by the elderly or the poor. But the
budget director said that would leave open the possibility of cuts
in items such as Medicare payments that go to doctors and hospitals.
   Citing the ongoing budget preparation process _ in which OMB
officials and agency heads still are making spending and program
decisions _ Wright said he could provide few details of where all
the cuts would be made.
   But he said that when the spending plan is sent to Congress on
Jan. 9, it would incorporate many of the program reductions, asset
sales and other proposals that Reagan has made in the past.
   ``I don't see any firestorms coming from the Hill as a result of
this budget,'' he said.
   In recent years, many of Reagan's budgets have been declared
``dead on arrival'' by leading lawmakers. Last year's budget process
went unusually smoothly, largely because of an agreement reached
between Congress and the administration last November that solved
many of the perennial disputes.
   Just two weeks ago, the administration projected the 1990 deficit
at $132 billion.
   But earlier Tuesday in its final economic forecast, the
administration said the nation's economy would grow by 2.6 percent
this year, 0.7 percent less than it would have without the dry, hot
weather that devastated many farmers and food producers.
   Poorer than expected economic performance adds to the
government's deficit by reducing its revenues and increasing its
expenditures.
   The government, however, projected a healthy growth rate for 1989
of 3.5 percent. It said consumer prices would rise by 3.7 percent
next year, down from an annual rate of 4.6 percent through the first
10 months of 1988.
   It also forecast that interest rates would begin to ease, and
that unemployment would average 5.2 percent. It was 5.3 percent in
October.
   Private economists immediately disputed the rosy forecasts.
   ``They're very optimistic,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist
with The Futures Group in Washington.
   But Beryl Sprinkel, Reagan's top economic adviser, said the
critics were being too gloomy.
   ``I do not want to be accused of making the final forecast of the
Reagan presidency too rosy,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Five gunmen wearing Halloween masks
robbed a jewelry store of nearly $4 million in goods Tuesday using
smoke bombs to cover their escape and later firing at a pursuing
officer, police said.
   The robbers stormed the H.T. Stuart jewelry store in the Town
Center mall about 6:20 p.m., disarmed a security guard and pointed
automatic weapons at three employees.
   Witnesses said one man scooped the diamonds and jewelry into a
bag, and the gunmen detonated smoke devices before fleeing through a
side door.
   Several minutes after the heist, Palm Beach County sheriff's
Deputy Darryl Cates stopped a white van used by the robbers, who
fired at Cates' car. Windshields on the patrol car were shattered,
but Cates was unharmed.
   The van was later found in a nearby parking lot with the masks, a
loaded automatic pistol and some of the stolen jewels.
   Store owner Stuart Dopplet said he did not know the exact losses,
but offered the $4 million estimate, noting that the value of one
diamond necklace taken was about $2 million.
   ``To me it's an absolute nightmare,'' he said.

   In a jealous rage, a policeman killed his
former live-in lover, her three children and her aunt and then shot
himself to death with his service revolver, authorities said.
   The slayings occurred in Campi Salentina, a small farming town
just north of this coastal city in the Apulia region in the heel of
the Italian ``boot.''
   A Carabinieri spokesman identified the assailant as Giuseppe
Pagano, a policeman assigned to guarding maritime offices in the
nearby city of Brindisi. He was believed to be in his 40s, but his
exact age was not immediately known.
   The spokesman, speaking under ground rules of anonymity, said
Pagano entered the apartment of his ex-lover, 40-year-old Cosima
Leo, and opened fire with his revolver.
   The gunfire killed the woman, her 71-year-old aunt, her
16-year-old daughter and two sons, aged 12 and 2, the spokesman
said. Pagano then shot himself through the temple.
   The spokesman said Pagano apparently acted in a fit of jealousy,
but he would not elaborate. The Italian news agency AGI said Pagano
was jealous because the woman had decided to return to her husband.
   It was the second mass slaying involving Italian police in a week.
   On Nov. 16, five Carabinieri were shot to death in their barracks
near Ravenna in central Italy. Investigators said they believe one
of the policemen went berserk, sprayed the other four with
submachine-gun and pistol fire and then shot himself.

   Iraq and Iran have expanded health care for their
citizens despite their eight-year war and child mortality is falling
in both countries, the head of the U.N. Children's Fund says.
   The official, UNICEF executive director James Grant, was to begin
today a six-day visit to Iran and Iraq to offer the agency's help in
reconstruction efforts following the cease-fire announced in August.
   UNICEF said it plans to aid both governments equip rural health
posts in war-damaged areas. Health and medical supplies worth a
total of $400,000 are due to arrive in each capital within two
weeks, a UNICEF announcement said.
   Grant, an American, will meet top officials in Tehran and Baghdad
and tour war-affected provinces, the announcement said.
   ``Despite the war, these two countries have done very impressive
things in providing health care for their children,'' Grant said in
the announcement. ``Both have made exemplary progress in expanding
their health networks over the past several years.
   ``We are seeing child mortality rates plummet in both
countries,'' he said.
   Vaccine coverage of children and protection against
life-threatening dehydration due to diarrhea has risen to ``enviable
levels,'' he said.
   Grant will be in Iran through Friday and in Iraq until Monday.

<HEAD>FAA Sees Improvements In Delta Cockpits But Some Lapses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A safety review at Delta Air Lines shows
improvements in operations and training, but lingering concern over
``lapses in crew coordination and discipline'' in some Delta
cockpits, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The FAA gave the assessment in a document made public Tuesday in
which an FAA team outlined its findings during an inspection at
Delta in early October.
   The agency team said Delta's management ``has taken strong and
positive action'' in response to a critical review of Delta's
operations 14 months ago and that it ``observed competent
performances in the majority of Delta's cockpits.''
   But the FAA said the team also ``observed many of the same
behavior patterns that were previously noted in the l987 audit'' in
which the airline was chatized for allowing poor discipline and
communications among flight crews. It said some Delta pilots may
``not perceive'' a problem or ``may simply not be observant'' enough
to correct their shortcomings.
   In the recent follow-up review, the FAA inspection team again
``observed lapses in crew coordination and discipine in a small but
significant percentage of cockpits,'' said the agency. It said some
pilots improperly used checklists, relied on memory when conducting
pre-flight checks, and in some cases demonstrated an ``unstructured
cockpit management'' style.
   The FAA also said Delta management pilots should be tougher when
conducting proficiency checks and too often require pilots to meet
only minimum standards.
   The airline has more than 6,500 pilots.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the company was ``in general
agreement with the report.'' He said the shortcomings cited by the
FAA inspection team will be addressed in new programs soon to go
into effect.
   Delta's cockpit operations and its training program came under
intense FAA scrutiny in the summer of l987 after a series of errors
by Delta pilots brought the airline close to having several serious
accidents including a near-collision over the Atlantic.
   Pilot performance also has become a focal point in the
investigation of the crash last August of a Delta Boeing 727 as it
attempted to depart the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. Federal
invetigators are trying to determine whether the three-man crew
forgot to properly set the wing flaps, causing the crash, which
killed 14 of the 108 people aboard.
   The FAA review made no mention of the crash.
   Since the string of incidents in l987, Delta's management has
improved its training and operational manuals and instituted other
training and quality control improvements, the FAA said.
   But it said some of the improvements have yet to go into effect.
A series of changes in the way pilots conduct checklists before
departure and prior to landing will go into effect next month. The
new procedures are aimed at clarifying the duties of each flight
crew member and require that each check procedure be acknowleged
verbally to lessen the possiblity one will be forgotten.
   Delta's revised ``cockpit resource management training program''
which has been under development for some time is scheduled to be
implemented next January, the FAA said.
   The FAA said it plans to continue monitoring the airline's
progress on implementing both programs.
   The FAA's interest in cockpit procedures at the major airlines
was sharpened last year by the string of Delta incidents and by the
crash in Detroit of a Northwest Airlines jet in which the two pilots
forgot to set the wing flaps, preventing the aircraft from gaining
proper lift.
   The 1987 Delta incidents included: A plane nearly colliding with
another jetliner over the North Atlantic because the Delta pilots
made a navigational error that took them 60 miles off course; a jet
almost ditching into the Pacific after the Delta captain mistakenly
turned off both of its engines, and two Delta planes in separate
incidents landing at a wrong airport and on a wrong runway.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Push For Program To Improve Water Quality Nationwide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ranking members of the Senate Agriculture
Committee are pushing for expansion of a major soil conservation
program in an effort to improve the nation's water quality.
   The lawmakers, led by panel chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., are
asking Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to broaden the focus of
the Conservation Reserve Program, which began in 1986.
   To date, some 25.5 million acres of farmland have been taken out
of production under the program, which is bringing participating
farmers an average of $50 a year for each acre not planted with
commercial crops.
   Most of the land falls into the category of highly erodible
terrain, which is stabilized with vegetation to minimize loss of
topsoil from precipitation and wind.
   But Leahy, Richard Lugar, R-Ind., Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., and
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., told Lyng in a letter released Tuesday that
they think it's time to broaden the program beyond combating soil
erosion.
   They said the eligibility guidelines should be expanded ``to
include croplands whose continued intensive use threatens surface
and groundwater.''
   ``With its emphasis almost entirely on highly erodible lands, the
department is missing a crucial opportunity to protect public health
and the environment,'' the senators wrote.
   Runoffs of pesticides and fertilizers are becoming an increasing
problem for both surface water and underground aquifers, according
to Kenneth Cook of the Conservation Foundation, a Washington
research group.
   The senators said that soil conservation also would be served by
allowing enrollment of land that is not classified as highly
erodible.
   ``The (department's) Economic Research Service has estimated that
targeting water quality could reduce the delivery of 90 million tons
of sediment to U.S. water annually,'' they said. ``This respresents
a 20 percent improvement over the existing program.''
   Jack Webb, chief of the department's land retirement and water
quality branch, said steps are being taken to make more than just
highly erodible land eligible for the $1.86 billion a year program.
   He said that earlier this year eligiblity was extended to
so-called filter strips _ parcels of land abutting waterways.
   Webb also said officials are preparing to propose rules that
would make another 10 million or more acres eligible for inclusion.
   These proposals are aimed at two areas: the Mississippi River
bottom lands from Baton Rouge, La., to Cairo, Ill., and the
so-called prairie pothole region of the northern Great Plains,
according to Webb.

   Republican governors, folding the tent
on their national conference, are giving up jellybeans for fried
pork rinds.
   As Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt sees it, the jellybeans favored by
President Reagan are now giving way to ``the new symbol'' of the new
administration _ crisply fried hog skins, which President-elect
George Bush claims as a favorite snack.
   ``I guess it means we skin the hogs,'' Hunt quipped Tuesday as he
passed out packages of the fried rinds to members of the National
Republican Governors Conference as it closed its four-day meeting at
the Grand Hotel resort.
   The light moment came after Bush spoke to the GOP governors,
saying Republicans ``are on our way to becoming the majority party
in America, if we don't lose sight of what is driving our success.''
   ``We're off and running on a very positive note with this
administration as Republican governors,'' said Kansas Gov. Mike
Hayden, the new chairman of the conference, which heard from Bush
and several members of his new White House team.
   Delaware Gov. Michael N. Castle, outgoing chairman of the
conference, said the sessions made clear there has been ``a
fundamental change in the way the country is looking at its
governing and its policies.''
   ``You begin to realize it is very much the Republican Party that
is in the mainstream,'' said Castle.
   ``It's a changing scene,'' said Hunt, host of the conference at
the coastal resort.
   ``We're not the party of big business,'' said the Alabama
governor, a Primitive Baptist minister. ``I was born on a farm.''
   Hunt said before the conference that about $200,000 was raised
from private sources to put the meeting together at the resort.
Hosts for the meeting included several major oil companies with
interests in offshore tracts near the Alabama coast, along with
Waste Management Inc. and other corporations.
   Hunt, however, emphasized the GOP's ties to grassroots voters.
And Bush, in his speech, said Hunt ``is a man who has never
forgotten his roots.''
   Bush said Hunt's religious faith and political courage were
emblematic of the modern GOP.
   ``He still preaches on Sunday at his home church in Holly Pond, I
believe (is) the name of it,'' said Bush. ``Two years ago Guy had
the courage to step up into the fray or what Teddy Roosevelt called
the arena against what were considered enormous odds, and ... he
showed those pollsters wrong. And what an oustanding job he's doing
for Alabama.''
   Hunt, who got help from a fractured Democratic Party when he rose
from also-ran to winner in 1986, was cited often at the conference
as an example of a new Republican South.
   Republicans suffered a net loss of one governorship in the
November election, dropping from 23 to 22. But GOP leaders said it
was actually a strong showing, with more significant losses often
expected for a party already in power in the White House.
   Hayden said Bush's speech indicated the new president will be
``very close to the Reagan administration on economic policy.''
   But he said Bush demonstrated again that ``he's his own man.''
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said the GOP conference at Point Clear
was the first such meeting ever held ``in the heart of Dixie.''
   Branstad, who will become chairman of the National Governors
Conference next year, said he looks forward to that group's meeting
at nearby Mobile in 1990.
   ``This humble country preacher really knows how to put on a great
conference,'' he said of Hunt.

   Three former U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents were charged Tuesday with laundering more than
$608,000 _ apparently accumulated while dealing in the narcotics
trade, authorities said.
   The cash was transferred to Swiss bank accounts to hide
unreported income, according to U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner and
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joyce A. Karlin.
   They refused to disclose any details about the source of the
money, but Bonner said ``the corrupting effects of drug
trafficking'' was to blame.
   John Jackson, 39, of Claremont and Wayne Countryman, 45, of
Walnut, were arrested Tuesday and were arraigned on a charge of
conspiring to defraud the United States by obstructing the duties of
the Internal Revenue Service.
   Jackson, who Karlin claims has associated with drug kingpins, was
ordered held without bail and Countryman was released on $120,000
bail late Tuesday.
   The third ex-agent, Darnell Garcia, 41, of Rancho Palos Verdes,
remained at large, she said, adding he may have fled to Madrid.
   If convicted of the conspiracy charge, each defendant faces a
maximum 5 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Jackson was a DEA agent from 1972 to September 1987; Countryman
from 1977 to October 1986 and Garcia from 1978 to August 1987. All
three had been assigned to the Los Angeles DEA office.
   ``All of the good, decent and honest DEA agents who regularly
place their lives on the line for our country can take pride in the
fact that this prosecution is the result of the investigative
efforts of DEA,'' Bonner said.

   Just when it seemed the pollsters had gone on
vacation after the Nov. 8 election, the Peanut Advisory Board says a
recent fan club survey shows that the average jar of peanut butter
is consumed in a month or less.
   According to the board, which is made up of peanut farmers in
Georgia, Alabama and Florida, 40.6 percent of those polled said a
jar lasts two weeks or less, while 35.4 percent reported less than a
month. Jar size was not specified.
   Nearly 4,000 people nationwide were surveyed as part of a
campaign billed by a New York public relations firm as the second
annual Adults Only Peanut Butter Lovers Fan Club Poll.
   ``The Adults Only Peanut Butter Lovers Fan Club, which recently
topped the 30,000-member mark, was established more than two years
ago as a support group for adults with a confessed passion for
peanut butter,'' the board said.
   Findings also showed that comedian Bill Cosby is the celebrity
25.4 percent said they would most like to eat peanut butter with,
followed by Robert Redford, 23.9 percent; Willard Scott, 23.9
percent (tie); Elizabeth Taylor 20.5 percent; and Phyllis Diller,
19.2 percent.
   But the survey report also showed that women and men differ about
their celebrity choices.
   Twenty-nine percent of the women said they would like to eat
peanut butter with Redford, while only 7.9 percent of the men said
they would. In the case of Elizabeth Taylor, 29.8 percent of the men
favored her, compared with 17.5 percent of the women.
   Other highlights of the survey:
   _Nearly 75 percent said they'd like a special occasion to
commemorate peanut butter. An annual day or week would be fine.
   _About 53 percent said they enjoy eating peanut butter with
children, while 52.1 percent preferred the company of their spouse,
and 35.7 percent opted for their best friend.
   _More than 78 percent of the fans surveyed said they have given
peanut butter or foods made with it as gifts. Nearly 72 percent said
they have received peanut butter items as gifts.
   _Asked about the most unusual place you have ever eaten peanut
butter, responses included: bathtub, bed, while traveling, on top of
a mountain and during war.
   Club membership is free of charge from: Adults Only Peanut Butter
Lovers Fan Club, 1133, Avenue of the Americas, 16th Floor, New York,
N.Y. 10036. Members receive a membership card, refrigerator magnet,
peanut butter recipe booklet and a quarterly newsletter.

   A growing Japanese appetite for hotdogs is
stirring up competition between the United States and several other
countries, including Australia and Mexico.
   Total sausage sales in Japan, made up mostly of frankfurters and
weiners, have grown 26 percent in the last three years, an
Agriculture Department report said Tuesday. Imports have more than
doubled.
   Shipments by U.S. processors in 1987 totaled 699 metric tons,
representing 28 percent of Japan's total sausage imports, the report
said.
   Other competitors include: Australia, with a 22 percent of 1987
Japanese sausage imports; Mexico, 15 percent; Taiwan, 9 percent;
Denmark, 6 percent; Netherlands, 5 percent; West Germany, 5 percent;
and others, 10 percent.
   ``Annual per capita consumption of sausage rose from 3.76 pounds
in 1983 to 4.83 pounds in 1987, fueled by a mushrooming demand for
Western-style meats and menus,'' said the report in Foreign
Agriculture magazine.
   Sausage as a main breakfast item is less common in Japan than in
the United States but this may change soon.
   ``McDonald's has introduced a sausage breakfast menu, and many
Western-style restaurants serve sausage for dinner,'' the report
said. Consumers tend to adopt such menus at home over time.''

   The Soviet Union has bought 500,000 metric tons
of U.S. grain sorghum for delivery in the marketing year that began
on Sept. 1, says the Agriculture Department.
   A spokeswoman, Vivian Ramey, said Tuesday it was the first time
that the Soviets have purchased U.S. sorghum. Traditionally, corn
and wheat are the chief grains for import, along with soybeans and
soybean meal.
   For example, more than 5.9 million tons of U.S. corn have been
sold to the Soviet Union for delivery in 1988-89.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or sorghum grain, or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The
500,000 tons of sorghum would be about 19.7 million bushels or about
11 million hundredweight.
   Sorghum prices last month averaged around $4.21 per 100 pounds or
$2.36 per bushel, according to USDA reports. Thus, the sale could
have a U.S. farm value of about $46 million.

   A 10.9 percent drop in the October federal
deficit over last year is offering little comfort to financial
markets and economists who expect only minimal improvement in the
budget gap this year.
   The Treasury Department said federal spending exceeded revenue by
$27.4 billion last month, the first month of the 1989 fiscal year,
down from $30.8 billion in the corresponding month a year ago.
   However, the $3.4 billion improvement was more than accounted for
by several special factors. Farm subsidy payments were down $2.3
billion thanks to higher commodity prices triggered by the summer
drought.
   And, military pay fell $2.6 billion because a year ago the
government shifted a pay period from 1987 to 1988. The accounting
trick made the 1987 deficit abnormally low and the 1988 budget gap
worse than otherwise.
   The Reagan administration is projecting the budget deficit in
fiscal 1989 will shrink to $145.5 billion, down from $155.1 billion
in the year ended Sept. 30. The Congressional Budget Office
forecasts $148 billion in red ink.
   But, most private economists are projecting a 1989 deficit little
improved and perhaps worse than 1988. In fact, fears in the markets
concerning President-elect George Bush's ability to curb the deficit
without breaking his no-tax pledge have driven the value of the
dollar down since his election.
   ``Foreign investors, who are financing a significant portion of
the seemingly endless budget deficit, are concerned about the
prospects for reduction in the Bush administration,'' said David
Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government
securities dealer in New York.
   He cited several factors, including the cleanup of the
government's nuclear plants and the rescue of the savings and loan
industry, that will demand new and higher government expenditures.
   In October, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
backs S&L deposits up to $100,000, spent $1 billion, compared with
$98 million a year ago.
   Also, the administration's economic forecast underlying its
budget projection _ higher growth and lower interest rates _
conflicts with the more pessimistic view of most private analysts.
   Beryl Sprinkel, President Reagan's chief economic adviser, said
Tuesday that the economy as measured by the Gross National Product
will grow 3.5 percent. Private economists, however, expect growth of
only 2 to 2.5 percent. Consequently, they believe the government
will collect less tax revenue. They also project higher interest
rates than the government, making it more costly to finance the $2.6
trillion national debt.
   ``We may have a few months that look better than last year, but I
don't think that can last,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with
Merrill Lynch. ``I suspect we'll see a deficit similar to last
year's; $150 billion to $160 billion is quite likely.''
   Government revenue in October totaled $63.6 billion, up 2.1
percent from the same month a year ago. Spending totaled $91.1
billion, down 2.2 percent.
   The largest spending categories in October were the military
followed by Social Security, interest on the national debt and
programs in the Department of Health and Human Services other than
Social Security.
   Military spending totaled $25.2 billion last month, down 0.3
percent from the same month a year ago.
   Spending for Social Security totaled $17.5 billion last month, up
5.4 percent. The other programs in the Department of Health and
Human Services, including Medicare and Medicaid, cost $11.7 billion
in October, a 16.8 percent decline over fiscal 1988.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $15.2 billion last month,
an increase of 7.4 percent.

   Up to 15 students from each of 30 U.S.
secondary schools will be spending their spring break in Soviet
classrooms. They'll be part of the first nationwide program allowing
students from each country to study in the other's schools.
   By then the Russian students who travel to America from sister
schools in the Soviet Union during their January holiday will have
returned home from the first phase of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. High School
Academic Partnership Program announced Tuesday by an education
consortium.
   ``We're really excited because in about 90 days we will be going
to live with Soviet families and attend Soviet schools,'' said Lisa
Cooper, a senior and student in fourth-year Russian at
Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Maryland.
   ``This program has the potential to be a very big step in
U.S.-Soviet relations,'' the 17-year-old Cooper told reporters at a
student-run press conference Tuesday.
   ``What makes this program so important is that when you talk
about international relations you're talking about more than just
governments you're talking about people,'' said Cooper, one of close
to 450 American students who will go to the Soviet Union in March.
   Anthony Mustillo, 17, also a fourth-year Russian language student
at Technical High School in Staten Island, N.Y., said he believes
the program will ``change many preconceived notions'' American and
Soviet students have of each other.
   ``Kids are kids everywhere, and politics are not their first
priority,'' said Mustillo, who will be making his second visit to
the Soviet Union through the partnership program.
   The program, an outgrowth of agreements signed by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev during the Moscow
summit last May, will involve public and private schools from 19
states and will be administered by a consortium consisting of the
American Council of Teachers of Russian, the National Association of
Secondary School Principals and Sister Cities International.
   Schools were selected for participation in the program in a
national competition on the basis of overall academic excellence,
availability of advance Russian language instruction, prospects for
developing local funding, and commitment to international studies.
Sister City relationships were also a consideration, said the
sponsors in a statement.
   The biggest challenge for American participation in the second
and third years of the program will be ``the need to find schools
with Russian language programs'' said Nancy Powell, principal of
Bethesda-Chevy Chase.
   Powell said she hoped the program will lead to ``a real sharing
of curriculum and teachers'' between the two superpowers.
   The program has received initial financing of $1 million for
three years from the United States Information Agency. Grants from
the sponsoring organizations, as well as school and community
fund-raisers, will provide additional funding for American students,
said project director Dan Davidson.
   The Soviet Union's Committee for Public Education will pay all
expenses for the Russian students.
   Research on students' attitudes and language ability will be done
before and after their travel, said Davidson.
   Vladmir Lukashin, head of the Soviet committee's Department for
Cooperation with Capitalist Countries said through an interpreter:
``I think this program is a result of perestroika and glasnost,''
the reform policies being developed under Gorbachev's leadership.
   ``I think that there will be such programs with all the countries
of the world,'' Lukashin added.
   Project officials stressed that they are still looking for
schools to participate in the second and third years of the program.
The deadline for applying is January 10, 1989. Schools can contact
the program office by mail at 1619 Massachusetts Ave., N.W.,
Washington D.C. 20036 or by phone at 202-328-7309.

<HEAD>Mrs. Aquino Says Tasaday Really Are Stone Age Tribe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said today
that the Tasaday are a legitimate Stone Age tribe and that those
seeking to discredit them as impostors are simply out to rob them of
their ancestral lands.
   It was the first time Mrs. Aquino commented publicly on the
Tasaday, who have become involved in international controversy since
the government said they were discovered in 1971 in the jungles of
Mindanao island.
   Then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared the Tasaday, who
numbered in the dozens, an indigenous tribe and set aside
timber-rich lands for them in Mindanao.
   But some Philippine scholars have branded the Tasaday a hoax that
Marcos perpetrated to gain international publicity for the
Philippines.
   Defenders of the Tasaday say skeptics simply want access to rich
timber lands or to discredit Marcos. But Mrs. Aquino told an
international conference of tribal minorities that the Tasaday
controversy underscores the need to protect primitive cultures from
exploitation.
   ``For apparently materialistic motives, and to open the groups'
... rich agricultural and timber ancestral lands for exploitation,
some scholars with media support denounced the existence of the
tribe as a hoax,'' she said.
   The president said the Tasaday controversy ``was a concrete
illustration of how an ethnic tribe's identity was all but lost in
the cross-currents of media hype and scholarly posturing.''
   Scholars who defend the Tasaday say they are descendants of
Manubo-speaking tribesmen who fled their coastal village more than
700 years ago to escape pirates.
   They fled into isolated jungle caves and over the centuries
reverted back to a Stone Age culture, supporters say. Others believe
the Tasaday remained in isolation because they feared diseases such
as smallpox, which were rampant in coastal areas.
   On Nov. 3, a congressional committee said a one-year study
substantiated the Tasaday's claim. The 21-page report said there was
no credible evidence to substantiate claims by several professors at
the University of the Philippines that the Tasaday were a hoax.

<HEAD>Justices Get Look At What TV Court Coverage Would Be Like</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Supreme Court justices got a firsthand
look at what televised coverage of the high court would be like. But
it may be quite a while before the public gets the same opportunity.
   Timothy B. Dyk, a lawyer representing 12 news organizations,
provided a 25-minute demonstration Monday on how cameras in the
court's ornate chamber would function.
   The idea was to prove coverage would not be disruptive.
   On hand and on the bench for the private demonstration were Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Anthony
M. Kennedy, dressed in business attire without their ceremonial
robes.
   Dyk declined to say how the justices reacted to the trial run.
But, he added, ``I don't know if there is a change'' in the court's
longstanding opposition to televised coverage of its argument
sessions.
   A court source who requested anonymity said, ``I'm not sure how
much significance can be read into this. There is still a great deal
of concern'' over the impact of televising court proceedings.
   The news organizations who asked for permission to give the court
a sample of televised coverage invited all nine justices. The
demonstration was not publicized, although word that it took place
leaked out.
   Dyk said the justices asked questions about the use of cameras
and a portion of the taped session was played back for them.
   One stationary camera was placed in front of the podium where
attorneys stand to address the court. A second camera operated by a
cameraman was placed on a tripod in an alcove of the chamber and was
focused on the bench to record the comments of the justices.
   There were no additional lights or microphones other than those
normally in use.
   Some justices have expressed concern over possible grandstanding
by lawyers and members of the court if cameras are allowed. They
also have said snippets of film footage shown to the public would
distort the nature of the hour-long argument sessions in cases heard
by the court.
   Rehnquist told a judicial conference earlier this year, ``I hope
we don't get to the time where the members of our court are trying
to get on the six o'clock news every night. And I think if they did,
it would lessen to a certain extent some of the (court's) mystique
and moral authority.''
   There also reportedly are fears by the justices they would not be
particularly telegenic. Sources said those concerns were heightened
by television coverage of the 1987 Senate hearings on the nomination
of Robert H. Bork to the court.
   Bork was defeated by the Senate in a bitter political battle, and
some commentators said he came across on television as too aloof and
scholarly.
   While nearly all states allow some televised state court
coverage, the federal courts have remained adamant in banning
cameras from their proceedings.

<TEXT>
   American voters, the polls said, weren't too
happy with the presidential choice between George Bush and Michael
Dukakis. Turnout plunged to its lowest point in years in this
month's balloting.
   Does this mean the time has come for a third party, for a new
political force to replace the faltering machinery of one of the
major parties?
   Third-party presidential hopefuls led by Ron Paul of the
Libertarian Party and Lenora Fulani from the New Alliance Party made
the case for major political change throughout the campaign.
   But the voters didn't much care for the choices that Paul, Fulani
and more than a dozen other minor party candidates offered on Nov. 8
either _ a sign that prospects remain dim for a major new party to
emerge in this country.
   Bush won about 48.1 million votes in defeating Dukakis, who
received about 41.1 million votes. That means only about half of the
adults in this country bothered to vote.
   But those numbers do add up to 99.1 percent of all the votes cast
in the presidential race.
   Paul, the former Republican congressman from Texas, got about
410,000 votes across the country. That figures out to only about
0.45 percent of the more than 90 million votes cast.
   Fulani was second among the second-rank candidates, drawing about
200,000 votes for about 0.22 percent of the vote. Her share of the
vote will probably rise slightly when final, official numbers come
in from her hometown, New York City.
   Then came such figures as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke,
who got about 44,000 votes running under such labels as Populist.
Onetime Democratic candidate Eugene McCarthy received about 30,000
votes in several states as the Consumer Party nominee. Extremist
Lyndon LaRouche, whose trial on various charges began this week, got
23,000 votes.
   Then there was Prohibition Party candidate Earl F. Dodge with
almost 8,000 votes.
   Taken all together, this was a bit better than their showing in
1984, when third-party candidates got about 0.7 percent of the vote
in the race featuring President Reagan and former Vice President
Walter Mondale.
   Paul's showing was better than the 1984 tallies for Libertarian
David Bergland, who he received about a quarter of one percent of
the total.
   But that is just trying to put the best light on bad returns.
None of these candidates came even close to the showing of George
Wallace in 1968 or John Anderson in 1980.
   The voters, faced by a choice they weren't happy with, did not
cast their ballots for any of the 18 or so minor party candidates
whose names were listed in this state or that.
   The other signs for third parties also are not too good.
   Even Richard Viguerie, the direct-mail guru, admits his
oft-voiced hopes for a conservative third party just aren't
realistic.
   ``What we'll do is go out there and put together a third force,''
he said this week as he expressed displeasure with Bush and what is
becoming a mostly moderate administration-to-be.
   Does this mean a third party?
   ``Oh no, no, no, no. Just a third force. The left operates in the
third-force arena with labor unions, with civil rights
organizations, with their own agenda, separate and apart from the
Democrats. That's what I think conservatives should be doing.''
   Minor parties haven't become major parties in this country for
more than 100 years and the reasons are many.
   Most Americans still grow up with some kind of partisan identity
as Democrats or Republicans, even though independent is now a label
many display even as they back the major parties' candidates with
remarkable consistency.
   The nation's election laws, written largely by major party
legislators, make that which is easy for major-party candidates _
getting on the ballot, for example _ very hard for third-party
candidates. Witness that only Fulani was able to get on the ballot
in all 50 states for Nov. 8 as a third-party hopeful.
   Raising money for third parties is tough, while the major party
candidates can even tap the federal treasury for presidential
elections.
   For all their problems, the Democratic and Republican parties
remain the only serious choices available in most elections and
probably will be so for years to come.
   Even when faced with a clear chance to just vote ``No,'' the
voters declined to pull that lever. ``None of These Candidates'' got
only about 2 percent of the vote in Nevada when running against Bush
and Dukakis this year.

<HEAD>Christopher Walken Stars in `Coriolanus'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presentation of Shakespeare's political tragedy
``Coriolanus'' so soon after Election Day may seem apt, but the New
York Shakespeare Festival production evokes the world of rock stars
more than that of presidential candidates.
   Christopher Walken, in the title role, is known primarily from
films but has acted other classical roles at the off-Broadway Public
Theater, where ``Coriolanus'' opened Tuesday night.
   He makes the part funnier than one might expect and the play less
tragic. Coriolanus is the equivalent of a Roman five-star general.
He comes back, victorious, and is expected to put on a cloak of
poverty and display wounds, after which the people will acclaim him
a Consul. He thinks that's dishonest; he is what he is, a successful
soldier, not given to pretending poverty or anything else to seek
favor.
   His two enemies say he's proud. He acts humble. The necktieless
Walken shows humility in a perfect imitation of some top rock stars'
self-deprecating humor. Ask Phil Collins if he's special and he'd
probably reply he's an ordinary bloke. The Beatles used to deflect
adulation with wit.
   What Walken doesn't do is address whether, underneath, Coriolanus
is proud or not. His characterization is understandable in
contemporary terms and rock stars are often more interesting than
politicos. But it's more simple than the play and therefore doesn't
allow his eventual destruction to fulfill the title, ``The Tragedy
of Coriolanus.''
   Irene Worth plays the silver-tongued, dominating mother who has
instilled warlike qualities in her son and glories in them. However,
she can't bring him up to her equal in brains or cunning. She calls
herself Juno-like in the play and Miss Worth certainly lives up to
the larger-than-life passions of that goddess.
   Broadway veteran Paul Hecht displays a statesmanlike demeanor and
authoritative voice as Menenius, who is pro-Coriolanus. Keith David
is stalwart, while knowing he is jealous of Coriolanus' popularity,
as Aufidius, general opposing Coriolanus in war.
   Moses Gunn and Thomas Kopache speak well and appropriately as
Roman generals.
   The two tribunes who inflame the people against Coriolanus are
more one-dimensionally self-interested than sometimes played.
Sharp-featured Larry Bryggman, cast as a villain on TV, and Andre
Braugher were directed by Steven Berkoff to walk in lockstep and
dress like Mafia henchmen. They could be played to show some concern
for the people or the state.
   Battles are choreographed motions, without prop swords. Since the
same actors make up both armies, a battle scene takes place with
whichever army is on stage, individuals ``fighting'' unseen
opponents.
   Some speeches are cut, mostly by peripheral people. Coriolanus'
son doesn't appear. The scene in which a Roman tells one of
Aufidius' men that Coriolanus is banished from Rome is gone but the
play isn't damaged by making his arrival before Aufidius a surprise.
   ``Coriolanus,'' in the Public Theater's Anspacher Theater, is the
sixth in the festival's ``Shakespeare Marathon'' which will present
all 36 plays. It's the first obscure one but, thus far, among the
more successful presentations.

   Judges granted approval early
Wednesday to take the body of Greek heiress Christina Onassis out of
the country for burial on a Greek island.
   Family and friends were expected to pick up the casket at 8:30
a.m. at the archbishopric of the Greek Orthodox Church, where it has
lain since Saturday, the private news agency Diarios y Noticias said.
   The agency quoted unidentified government sources as saying
Federal Judge Alberto Piotti and other judges who had jurisdiction
in the case accepted Interior Minister Enrique Nosiglia's request
that the proceeding be expedited to avoid diplomatic problems.
   Ms. Onassis, 37, died suddenly on Saturday morning.
   A preliminary coroner's report on Monday said the cause of death
was acute pulmonary edema, or an accumulation of fluid in her lungs.
It did not say what caused the accumulation.
   Determination of the cause of death has held up delivery of Ms.
Onassis' body to family members, who intend to take it for burial in
a mausoleum on the family-owned island of Skorpios in the Ionian Sea.
   Ms. Onassis inherited a fortune estimated at $500 million from
her father Aristotle, who died in 1975.

   A diver seeking clues to the fate of D.B.
Cooper, the legendary hijacker who disappeared 17 years ago, says he
found a small parachute in the Columbia River about a mile upstream
from where $5,800 of Cooper's ransom washed up in 1980.
   The diver, 33-year-old Curtis Rainey of Portland, Ore., was
working for Richard Tosaw, a lawyer from Ceres, Calif., who has
spent each Thanksgiving season for seven years searching for
Cooper's remains.
   The nylon ``pilot'' parachute, used for deploying the main canopy
of a parachute such as the one Cooper had, was found Monday about 5
miles west of Vancouver on the Washington side of the river, Rainey
and Tosaw said.
   Cooper parachuted out of a Northwest Air Lines 727 with $200,000
in ransom money on Thanksgiving Eve, 1971. Except for the
waterlogged bills that washed up on the banks of the Columbia nine
years later, no trace of him has ever turned up.
   Tosaw admitted there could be many explanations for the
discovery, but he noted it was the most interesting piece of
evidence he's found since he made the Cooper search his hobby.
   ``The interesting thing is it was found in a place where he
pretty much has to be, give or take a mile or so,'' Tosaw said.
   Rainey planned to take the parachute on Thanksgiving to
Woodinville to be examined by Earl Cossey, who packed Cooper's
parachute.
   However, Cossey said late Tuesday that he had been given a
description of the pilot chute by telephone, and it sounded like it
was from an earlier design than the one Cooper used.
   ``There are probably a million of those in the world,'' Cossey
said. While the main parachute would be identifiable by stitching or
possibly a registration number, the pilot chute would bear no
identifying marks, he said.
   The FBI said Tosaw hadn't informed the agency of the discovery.
   ``We would be able to identify these parachutes but the process
would be part of our investigation and therefore something we
wouldn't comment on,'' said John Eyer of the Seattle FBI office.
   Tosaw, who has written a book titled ``D.B. Cooper, Dead or
Alive,'' said he has decided Cooper drowned and his remains became
hung up on one of the rows of pilings that extend into the river
about every half-mile to prevent erosion.
   The parachute was found snagged among such pilings about a mile
upstream from the beach where 8-year-old Brian Ingram found $5,800
of Cooper's loot in 1980, Tosaw said.
   Rainey, who along with diving partner Jamie Winkle of Portland
has worked for Tosaw on the Cooper search for three years, found the
parachute mostly intact and barely sticking out of the sand under
about 20 feet of water, the divers said.
   Cooper got his ransom and parachutes during a Seattle stopover
after hijacking a flight by displaying what appeared to be dynamite.

<HEAD>ABC's `War and Remembrance' Drops in Ratings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TV viewers chose laughter over war last week
as six comedies ranked in the top 10 and the best an episode of
ABC's miniseries ``War and Remembrance'' did was 10th, according to
the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Four episodes of the World War II epic based on the novel by
Herman Wouk placed in the top 20, but fell below expectations for a
miniseries that cost $104 million, was heavily promoted and widely
lauded by critics.
   NBC won the week, with ABC coming in second. Five NBC comedy
series placed ahead of the highest-rated episode of the miniseries,
as did one ABC comedy show, CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She
Wrote.''
   ABC reportedly told its advertisers that ``War and Remembrance''
would average 20.2 in the Nielsen ratings. Only the first episode
the previous week exceeded that at 21.8.
   ``War and Remembrance'' is the sequel to ``The Winds of War,''
which got a 38.6 rating and a 53 share over 18 hours in 1983. The
first 18 hours of the sequel is being shown in seven episodes over
11 nights. Two more episodes were to be telecast this week. The
final 12 hours will not be telecast until May.
   Bob Wright, an ABC spokesman, said there would be no comment on
the ratings until after the final episode of the first 18 hours.
   The future of longer miniseries does not look good in view of the
disappointing ratings for ``War and Remembrance'' and the loss ABC
will take. Prior to the telecasts, ABC had forecast a loss of $20
million.
   NBC, which had predicted the ABC miniseries would sweep the
ratings, took it on with a vigorous promotion of its comedy shows.
   ``Our calculated plan of youth-oriented counterprogramming,
coupled with aggressive and creative promotion, had the absolute
right effect with the viewing audience,'' said Brandon Tartikoff,
president of NBC Entertainment.
   ``I'm happy NBC has kept its prime-time win streak alive in the
heart of the November sweeps.''
   Here are the rankings, ratings and shares for the episodes
telecast last week: Part III, in 10th place, 19.9 rating, 31 share;
Part II, in 11th place, 19.0, 29; Part V, 17th place, 17.0, 26; Part
IV, tied for 18th place with NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' 16.8, 25.
   NBC won the week with an average rating of 15.8; ABC had 14.9 and
CBS 12.4.
   Each ratings point equals 904,000 homes with television. The
share is a percentage of the sets in use.
   For the season to date, NBC stayed ahead with an average 15.5
rating; ABC had 13.8 and CBS 12.3. NBC also led in the Nielsens for
the November sweeps, the period used to determine advertising rates.
The ratings: NBC 15.4, ABC 13.6, CBS 12.2.
   Here are the top 10: ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World,''
``The Golden Girls,'' ``60 Minutes,'' CBS; ``Cheers,'' ``Empty
Nest,'' both NBC; ``Growing Pains,'' ABC; ``Murder, She Wrote,''
CBS; NBC Monday Night Movie, ``Too Good To Be True,'' NBC; ``War and
Remembrance,'' Part III, ABC.
   Fox Broadcasting's ``Married...With Children'' got the highest
prime-time rating to date for the ``fourth network'' with a 10.0
rating and a 14 share. The next show was Fox's ``America's Most
Wanted.'' Both shows did better than 12 series from CBS and ABC.
   Among news show, ``ABC World News Tonight'' was first with an
11.3 rating. ``The CBS Evening News'' was next with 11.2. ``The NBC
Nightly News'' had 10.5.

<HEAD>Ailing Emperor No Longer Initiates Conversations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito, bedridden since Sept. 19 with
severe internal bleeding, no longer initiates conversations and
sleeps most of the time, a palace official said today.
   Japanese news media said the 87-year-old monarch's condition is
declining. But palace officials said that although Hirohito is
feeble, he is in stable condition. One official said on condition of
anonymity that the emperor nods in response to questions from his
aides.
   Hirohito's blood pressure was relatively low, but palace doctors
did not anticipate any major changes in his condition, said Kenji
Maeda, spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency, which handles
all palace affairs.
   The emperor's condition was judged stable enough for his
grandson, Prince Aya, to return today to England, where he is
studying at Oxford University. Aya was summoned back to Japan on
Nov. 7 after a sudden deterioration in Hirohito's condition.
   The world's longest-reigning monarch has not discharged any blood
for more than two weeks, but his doctors are concerned about the
danger of another massive hemorrhage, Maeda said in a regular
briefing.
   The bleeding is believed to be coming from the upper intestine
near an intestinal bypass operation performed in September 1987.
   Hirohito has eaten just a few spoonfuls of porridge since falling
ill and is fed intravenously. His weight has fallen from 106 to 66
pounds.
   The emperor has received a 42.4 pints of blood in transfusions in
over the past two months to combat anemia and jaundice, court
doctors said.
   Palace officials say court doctors are unsure whether Hirohito
actually watches his favorite weekday drama when the television set
is turned on for him. A major newspaper, the Mainichi Shimbun,
quoted unidentified palace sources today as saying that the emperor
can no longer distinguish between night and day.
   Palace officials have refused to comment on news reports that the
emperor has pancreatic cancer.

<HEAD>Research Network Offers Link for Doctors Treating AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials are setting up a
community-based research network that would encourage more
physicians and patients to participate in and learn from
experimental AIDS treatments.
   The program announced Tuesday by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, AIDS
coordinator for the National Institutes of Health, is designed to
complement more than 30 full-fledged, NIH controlled clinical
studies already under way at major research centers around the
nation.
   The effort is calculated in part to offer hope to AIDS patients
and their doctors who are not part of such classic experiments.
   Grants to be distributed by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, headed by Fauci, will go primarily to linking
via computers the health professions willing to participate in the
grass-roots program.
   ``These new programs will broaden the base of our clinical
investigations by including primary care physicians who are not
affiliated with AIDS research efforts that are currently supported
by NIAID,'' said Fauci.
   ``We are pleased to create a way to draw on the enthusiasm and
experience of community physicians and their patients, who wish to
have greater involvement in the national research effort on AIDS,''
he said in announcing the program at a conference of the private
National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
   ``Through these programs, we also hope to include in clinical
trials more HIV-infected black and Hispanic persons and intravenous
drug users and more women at risk of HIV infection.''
   In its final report last summer, the White House AIDS commission
called for greater attention to community-based initiatives against
AIDS and more federal effort to coordinate those efforts.
   The commission also noted that HIV infection, the virus that
causes AIDS, is now spreading most rapidly among intravenous drug
users who share contaminated needs and called for spending $15
billion over the next decade to tackle the drug problem.
   Fauci said the community programs will operated separately but be
coordinated with the treatment evaluation network already in place
by his institute to keep tabs on more sophisticated research.
   Dr. Lawrence R. Deyton, one of the founders of the Whitman-Walker
Clinic in Washington, a major community treatment and testing
center, is the NIH official designated to head the expanded
community network.
   ``The focus of this program is the community practitioner working
in the area where his or her patients,'' said Deyton. ``It can help
improve the quality of their health care and, at the same time,
increase the knowledge gained through treatment research.''
   An NIH background paper said, ``The relative lack of proven
medical interventions for HIV infection and the many men and women
willing, in fact desperate, to participate in clinical trials has
created an environment in which potential therapies are administered
in the face of meager or even no evidence.''
   ``Enrolling in a research study offers each participant a
personal measure of hope,'' the paper continued. ``Extensive and
well organized networks of information on current research studies,
commonly accepted therapies, and alternative therapies have become
integral in the lives of many HIV infections persons as well as the
physicians and nurses caring for them.''
   Recognizing that many treatment centers unaccustomed to applying
for federal grants may want to participate, announcements being
prepared by NIH invite those who need help in making formal
applications to request such assistance in their initial contact
with Deyton's office.

<HEAD>Parents Charged With Selling Baby For Cocaine, Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ODENTON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a 2-month-old baby have been
charged with selling their son for $3,500 and three ounces of uncut
cocaine, police said.
   Charles Albert Pannuty, and Gayle Duty, both 35 of Severn, were
arrested in a parking lot Tuesday, said Sgt. Joseph Bisesi of the
Anne Arundel County Police Department.
   The baby, Joseph Patrick Pannuty, was turned over to child
protective services, he said. The couple has four other children,
but Bisesi said he didn't know whether they had been turned over to
authorities.
   The arrests culminated a two-month investigation that began after
police heard a couple was trying to sell a baby, Bisesi said. The
infant, born prematurely, was originally offered for sale for $5,000
but undercover officers bargained the price down, he said. The
couple signed a contract to sell the baby, Bisesi said.
   Pannuty and Ms. Duty were charged with baby-selling, which is
punishable by up to a year in prison upon conviction, Bisesi said.
Pannuty was also charged with distribution of cocaine and marijuana
because he sold undercover police drugs on four previous occasions,
Bisesi said.
   Ms. Duty and Pannuty also were charged with possession with
intent to distribute cocaine.

   Noah the Boa is a free snake again
after nearly four days of captivity in the dashboard of a car
belonging to one of his red-faced handlers.
   Judy Booth of the J.L. Johnson Nature Center said she drove the
6-pound, 5-foot-long boa constrictor to a preschool for a Friday
morning presentation.
   ``I put him back in the car and went to lunch for about an
hour,'' Booth said. ``That was a big mistake.''
   Noah, probably spooked by unfamiliar surroundings, slithered out
of his pillowcase carrier and under the dashboard, she said.
   After failing to lure the serpent out with morsels of his
favorite foods, she was forced to spend the weekend keeping Noah
warm with a heat lamp.
   Booth took the car to a auto dealership Monday, where Rick
Hetchler and another mechanic freed the snake as about two dozen
people watched.
   ``I don't see any puncture wounds,'' Booth said after inspecting
Noah. ``I think he's OK.''
   ``It was no big deal,'' Hetchler said. ``It's just a snake. The
fun part will be putting the dashboard back together.''

<HEAD>Art Collector Will Leaves Home, Collection as Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Lloyd Kreeger, one of Washington's most
noted art collectors, says he and his wife intend to have the public
one day browse through their modernistic home and enjoy their
massive collection of 19th and 20th Century art.
   The Kreegers disclosed Wednesday that they will leave their
Foxhall Road home, designed by architect Philip Johnson, to a
foundation, which they will establish, so that the modernistic home
can be turned into a museum where the collection will be on display.
   The value of the Kreeger collection is not known. Four years ago,
well before the dramatic escalation of art prices, it was valued at
an estimated $30 million. Their home has been assessed at $3.3
million, but is worth much more than that on the market.
   Kreeger, 79, is a former president of Government Employees
Insurance Co., and has a net worth believed to be between $50
million and $75 million.
   The gift established by the Kreegers will include an endowment in
the millions of dollars to operate the museum. The Kreegers' two
children will be trustees of the art collection which includes many
impressionist and post-impressionist pieces.
   The Kreegers began buying paintings in l952. Their collection
includes the pre-blue-period Picasso `Cafe La Rotonde' and a late
Claude Monet, ``Misty River Scene''.
   There are paintings by more than 100 artists such as van Gogh,
Degas, Renoir, Bonnard, Kandinsky, Sisley, Corot, Rouault, Dufy,
Pissarro, Utrillo, Courbet, Braque, Avery, and Dubuffet.
   Sculptures by Arp, Picasso, Lipschitz, Noguchi and Moore, among
others, are in a courtyard that surrounds a swimming pool.

<HEAD>Advisory Panel Urges Indepth Study Of Breast Implants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal advisory panel is calling for a
long-term study of the safety of silicone breast implants but says
there is not enough evidence of health risk now to ban the procedure.
   An estimated 2 million U.S. women have received implants over the
past two decades even though the Food and Drug Administration has
never fully reviewed how safe they are.
   A seven-member panel of outside experts convened by the agency
concluded Tuesday that the FDA should work with physicians, patients
and silicone implant manufacturers to design a series of studies
that will fully address the question over the next few years.
   Meanwhile, the committee agreed unanimously that there is no
reason to call for a ban on new implants unless new and substantial
evidence of harm surfaces before the group meets again in two months.
   Dr. John H. Davis, chairman of surgery at the University of
Vermont medical school, told fellow panelists he had never done a
breast implant but could speak as a husband and father of three
daughters.
   He said the procedure has been ``a great boon to women'' and that
since no comparable substitute is available, ``I don't believe I can
throw it out the window and say no.''
   About 15 percent of breast implants are done for women who have
lost part or all of their breasts to cancer surgery and Davis said
denying them access to reconstructive surgery might influence some
to ``accept the wrong kind of threatment or retreat'' from seeking
early treatment at all.
   He acknowledged that it will take a long time _ perhaps decades _
to definitely determine the safety of breast implants.
   ``We will not answer this question for the women in this room,
unfortunately, but we can answer it for your children,'' said Davis.
   Dr. Geneviene M. Matanoski, an epidemologist at Johns Hopkins,
agreed with Davis' assessment of the difficulties in compiling
definitive data over a period of years.
   ``Certainly the answer is not to panic 2 million women,'' she
said in concurring with the panel's unanimous recommendation against
calling for a ban.
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen Health Research Group has
called for a ban, based largely on recent studies that showed
silicone implants caused certain types of cancer in rats.
   However, there are substantial questions about whether human
tissue reacts the same way as rat tissue when confronted with
foreign tissue, particularly in developing the type of tumors caused
in the rats.
   Dr. John E. Martin, appearing on behalf of the American College
of Radiology, told the panel that of the thousands of women who have
sought treatment for breast cancer at the M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Texas over the past 40 years, only 35 had the type of
tumor the rat studies suggested might occur in humans subjected to
silicone transplants.
   Martin said no such breast cancers had been seen at M.D. Anderson
in the past 10 years and decried what he called ``unfortunate
publicity associated with this scare.''
   He compared the recent concern by women about breast implants
with earlier questions about whether the radiation associated with a
breast X-ray argued against using the procedure as a screening
device. By the time those questions had been resolved in the
negative, he said, ``The emotional damage to women had already been
done.''
   The advisory committee called for:
   _Establishment of a national registry of women who have breast
implants so long-range studies can be carried out to determine
whether there is a heightened risk of breast cancer or other health
problems.
   _Drafting of a mandatory, standardized consent form to be signed
by any prospective patient for a breast implant before the procedure
can be done.
   _An FDA policy to keep physicians and the public aware of any new
information as it develops from whatever long-range studies are
devised.
   Since silicone breast implants were already on the market in 1976
when Congress gave the FDA authority over medical devices, they were
given ``grandfather'' approval under the law.
   Now the FDA has invoked essentially the same procedure that would
be used to establish the safety of a new product, but has no
standing to remove breast implants from the market in the absence of
clear evidence that they are a definite health risk.
   The significance of the advisory panel's conclusion was that it
saw no evidence of such a clear risk.

   A train struck a car Tuesday at a
railroad crossing in fog, killing five members of a family in the
car and injuring three others, authorities said.
   The parents and three of their children were pronounced dead at
the scene, authorities said. The other three children were taken to
hospitals. The children were all under age 9.
   No one in the train was injured, and the train was sent on its
way, according to the Highway Patrol.
   The crash occurred on a rural gravel road about five miles west
of Valley City, said Dolph Oldenburg, a Barnes County correctional
officer.
   State Highway Patrolman Roger Haga said the engineer of the
westbound Burlington Northern train blew the engine's whistle before
crossing the intersection. But fog covered the area, and the driver
of the northbound car apparently did not see nor hear the train, the
patrolman said.
   Two children were taken to Mercy Hospital in Valley City. One
child wandered away from the wreck and was found about an hour later
and taken to the hospital, Haga said.
   Mercy Hospital spokeswoman Connie Reed said a 5-year-old girl was
transferred by ambulance to a Fargo hospital where she was in
critical condition Tuesday night, and two boys, ages 4 and 6, were
in stable condition in the Valley City hospital.
   The identities of the victims were not released.
   No other details were available.

<HEAD>No-Smoking Policy Leaves Patients, Docs Out In Cold</HEAD>

   A hospital's anti-smoking policy has gone up
in smoke because it sent so many patients, doctors and nurses
outside to light up.
   Trinity Memorial Hospital was among the Milwaukee area hospitals
that became smoke-free as of July 4, with smoking either banned or
severely restricted.
   The edict at Trinity Memorial meant smokers had no alternative
but to go outside, ``and they persisted in doing so,'' said James
Streed, a hospital spokesman.
   The resulting problems, he said, included:
   _Patients began congregating outdoors in their hospital gowns,
even though many of them had to drag their intravenous equipment
with them.
   _Nurses sometimes had to accompany the patients, which took
personnel away from work stations.
   _Some nurses, physicians and other employees also went outdoors
to smoke, and while outside were unable to hear the paging system.
   After four months, it was decided that for the sake of patient
safety, smokers would be brought back indoors under a relaxed
policy, Streed said this week.
   Smoking now is allowed in designated areas of the coffee shop and
employee cafeteria, he said.
   Although ventilation in the two designated smoking areas has been
improved to keep smoke out of non-smoking areas, the new policy has
rekindled some of the past debate over the issue.
   ``It gets to be a bit like legislating morality,'' Streed said.
``The smokers feel it's about time that they're accommodated more
humanely.''
   On the other hand, he said, the non-smokers felt that it was
hypocritical for a hospital to allow people to pursue an unhealthy
habit on its premises.
   ``People are people, and they're all different,'' Streed said.
``To deal with stress, some people do unhealthy things.''
   ``We're not doing anything to encourage smoking,'' he said. ``We
don't sell tobacco.''

<HEAD>Free Trade Agreement On Track After Mulroney Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Claiming a clear national mandate for the free
trade agreement with the United States, Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney said he will proceed to quick enactment.
   He announced Tuesday, the day after leading his Progressive
Conservative Party to its second consecutive majority government,
that Parliament will be called back into session the week of Dec. 12.
   The U.S. Congress has passed legislation needed for the trade
pact to start taking effect Jan. 1 as scheduled, but it still needs
final Canadian parliamentary approval.
   ``The Canadian people have given us a clear mandate to implement
the free trade agreement. We intend to do so,'' the prime minister
said at a nationally televised news conference from his hometown of
Baie-Comeau, Quebec.
   His party won 170 seats in the 295-member House of Commons in a
campaign completely dominated by the free trade issue and marked by
intense opposition from Liberal Party leader John Turner.
   The Liberals won 82 seats and the socialist New Democratic Party,
which also opposed the agreement, will have 43 seats in the new
House.
   President Reagan, who signed the agreement with Mulroney on Jan.
2, congratulated the prime minister in a telephone call Tuesday from
his ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif.
   ``In recent years, relations between the United States and Canada
have been marked by cooperative dialogue and a remarkable record of
mutually beneficial achievement,'' he said in a statement released
by the White House.
   Mulroney also said he spoke with President-elect George Bush and
was willing to meet with him before the U.S. inauguration.
   The Canadian dollar jumped in value against the U.S. dollar to
more than 83 cents on the strength of the Conservative victory. It
had slipped as low as below 81 cents during the campaign.
   The trade pact phases out all remaining tariffs between the two
countries, already each other's largest trading partners, over a
10-year period. It also dismantles many investment barriers; frees
up trade in energy and services, and creates Canadian-U.S. panels to
settle disputes.
   During the campaign, Turner and other opponents of the agreement
charged that it endangers not just Canada's extensive social and
health care programs, but national sovereignty itself.
   They said Canada's 26 million people will be overwhelmed by the
245 million people and vastly superior economic power of the United
States.
   Mulroney and the supporters said instead that future Canadian
prosperity is assured by guaranteeing access to the larger U.S.
market. They insisted that Canada is mature and fully able to
compete in a North American marketplace without the system of high
tariffs dating back to the last century.
   The support was solid for the free trade agreement in Mulroney's
native Quebec, the French-speaking province where entrepreneurship
is credited for a 1980s economic revival, and in the Western
oil-and-gas center of Alberta.
   And the opposition was not solid enough in English-speaking
Ontario, Canada's largest province, where the Liberals were counting
on a strong showing to keep Mulroney from a majority.
   ``We have received considerable support in all regions,''
Mulroney said Tuesday. ``We have received very heavy support in
Quebec and Ontario and in the west. I think we have the right to say
we have a national mandate.''
   About 75 percent of Canada's 17.5 million voters took part in the
election. The Conservatives got 43 percent of the popular vote, the
Liberals 32 and the New Democrats 20 percent.

   The Soviet Union today staged its second
underground nuclear test in less than two weeks, detonating a device
with a yield approaching that of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, the Tass
news agency reported.
   Tass said the test blast, with a yield of up to 20 kilotons,
occurred at 6:57 a.m. Moscow time at the Semipalatinsk test range on
the steppes of Kazakhstan in Soviet Central Asia.
   ``The test was conducted to check the results of research in the
physics of a nuclear explosion,'' Tass reported, without providing
details. It said radiation levels at Semipalatinsk and nearby were
normal.
   In their most recent test, the Soviets exploded a nuclear device
at Semipalatinsk on Nov. 12.
   Twenty kilotons, the force of 20,000 tons of TNT, was the yield
of the U.S. atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.

   Martha Reeves is still loyal to the
Motown sound, even though the company once relocated its offices
without telling her, a discovery she made when she, well, heard it
through the grapevine.
   ``I still stand and sing the songs because I remember the good
times, the loyalty and working hard to please Berry Gordy,'' said
Ms. Reeves, who's appearing in Atlantic City until next month.
   In 1960, Gordy built his music empire in Detroit, Ms. Reeves'
hometown. She joined the company in 1962 as secretary and later
began singing backup.
   In 1963, Martha and The Vandellas were born with the release of
``Come Get These Memories'' and ``Heat Wave.'' In 1964, they had
their biggest hit, ``Dancing in the Streets.''
   But she once returned from an overseas engagement in 1971 and

   Mrs. Cruz has one other son, Justin Benigno, 3. The president's
other grandchild, Miguel, 1, is the son of her daughter, Maria
Aurora Abelleda.
   Mrs. Aquino took office on Feb. 25, 1986, after a popular

   Michael Reagan, the last of the presidential
family to enter show business, is involved in a dispute with a game
show host that has all the makings of a feisty soap opera.
   Reagan has filed a claim against the producers of the syndicated
series ``Lingo,'' alleging that Ralph Andrews Productions has failed
to pay him more than $20,000 in back pay, rerun fees and pension and
benefits.
   Andrews admits he probably owes Reagan the money, but said the
show is in ``great financial difficulty.''
   The company, which hired Reagan to be host of the show for 20
weeks, also accused him of being an ``ingrate,'' saying ``no one
else (but me) would give him a chance in this town.''
   Reagan, the 43-year-old adopted son of Ronald Reagan and ex-wife,
Jane Wyman, retaliated, ``Andrews couldn't tell the truth if his
mother's life depended on it.''
   Reagan, Andrews said, was hired at a weekly salary of $4,000.
With five weeks remaining in the deal, Andrews said, Reagan walked
off the show, and Andrews was forced to take over.
   Barring a settlement, the matter will be decided early next year
by an arbitration board at the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists.

<HEAD>Agreement to Clean Up Nuclear Plant Seen as Model for Other Waste
Sites</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A landmark agreement under which the U.S.
government will conduct a $50 million cleanup of a
uranium-enrichment plant could become a model for dealing with other
toxic waste sites, officials said.
   The agreement covering the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant
near Piketon in southern Ohio was significant because the U.S.
Department of Energy would be bound by state law and regulation,
said Gov. Richard Celeste.
   ``The Department of Energy is now voluntarily, without court
action, declaring itself, in effect, free from sovereign immunity,''
Celeste told a news conference Tuesday. ``They're acknowledging that
they must be accountable under the environmental laws of the state
of Ohio. ...
   ``It's a good arrangement, and I would hope that it could become
a model for other tough cases that we're wrestling with, like that
at Fernald,'' Celeste said.
   The federally owned Fernald plant near Cincinnati has dumped
radioactive waste improperly, possibly contaminating ground water,
since it began processing uranium for nuclear weapons in 1951,
according to environmental officials.
   The Piketon plant, which processes uranium for fuel for nuclear
power reactors, generates toxic wastes such as polychlorinated
byphenyls or PCBs, solvents and metals, as well as radioactive
materials.
   The settlement provides for the Energy Department to be subject
to newly issued orders from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
requiring a comprehensive cleanup of the site under state
supervision.
   Details of the pact still must be incorporated into a federal
court consent decree.
   ``It's a very large step forward and a significant shift in their
own policies and their own attitudes,'' said state Attorney General
Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr.
   Increasing congressional and public scrutiny of the nuclear waste
problem helped change the Energy Department's stance, he added.
   ``Anytime somebody that has a say over your budget starts putting
heat on you, people tend to react,'' he said. ``The other thing I
think that was a factor is that very simply the Department of Energy
was perceiving that it had truly an image problem with the sort of
arrogant attitude that they were taking.''
   The Energy Department has disclosed problems at some of its
nuclear production plants and has wholly or partly closed down four
of its 17 major plants. Officials have estimated cleanup will cost
$110 billion.
   Celebrezze said the agreement didn't address the question of
fines for pollution violations, but talks are continuing between
state and federal officials.
   ``We're negotiating, and any time we start talking about
penalties and fines you get to very sensitive parts of the
negotiations,'' Celebrezze said. ``I just don't even want to
speculate on that.''
   Piketon site manager Gene Gillespie said the Department of Energy
had agreed to clean up roughly 6 million pounds of wastes after a
final negotiating session Nov. 7.
   ``There's a lot of things involved. We're cleaning up waste that
had been generated over the past 30 years, a lot of things that were
accepted practices in the past that aren't any more,'' Gillespie
said.
   The cleanup may cost more than $50 million during the next five
years, he said. The department's fiscal 1989 budget sets aside $10
million for the first phase.
   Robert E. Anderson, environmental coordinator for Martin Marietta
Energy Systems, the contractor that operates Piketon, said some
cleanup was started in 1987 and continued this year during
negotiations.
   He said the toxic solvent levels in ground water at the site are
``tens to hundreds of times'' the acceptable levels for drinking
water.
   Bedrock separates the ground water at the site from the Teays
Valley Aquifer that provides drinking water for the area, he said,
adding that it would take 10 to 15 years for contaminated water to
leave the site.

<TEXT>
   Israeli journalists say government orders
restricting news coverage of the PLO and the Palestinian uprising
make Israel look like Arab nations whose news coverage is completely
under government control.
   ``There is a political consensus to stop information from coming
out,'' Elisha Shpiegelman, head of the Jerusalem Journalists
Association, told about 300 people at a rally Tuesday. Other
meetings were held in Tel Aviv and Haifa.
   The protests followed a government order to restrict coverage of
the Palestine National Council meeting in Algiers last week during
which a Palestinian state was proclaimed.
   The order banned coverage of speeches at the council session and
affected Israel's state-run television and radio. The council acts
as legislature for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``Syria, Egypt and Jordan did not broadcast the conference. Are
we democracies like they are?'' said Gabi Brun, a union leader at
the newspaper Yediot Ahronot newspaper.
   Israel Broadcast Authority officials said they acted at the
request of Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who feared televised
excerpts of the council session would fuel the year-long Palestinian
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``It's not a form of censorship, it's a form of exercising our
editorial function,'' said Ari Avneri, an aide to broadcast
authority chief Uri Porat.
   TV correspondent Moshe Raz said broadcast journalists must refer
to the occupied lands by their biblical names, a practice that
implies Israel has an ancient right to the areas, which it seized in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``One day they decided that there was no West Bank and Gaza
Strip, only Judea, Samaria and the Gaza District,'' Raz said.
   He said television news is required to call PLO members
``terrorists'' whether or not they belonged to a military wing of
the PLO.
   Shpiegelman said journalists who violate the unwritten guidelines
or complain are asked to resign.

<HEAD>Auction House Fined For Peddling Paintings For Peanuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered an auction house to pay a woman
$200,000 for failing to recognize a pair of paintings as possible
masterworks, and then selling them for just one-tenth of their worth.
   High Court Judge Simon Brown on Tuesday ordered Messenger May
Baverstock to pay damages to Penelope Luxmoore-May for botching the
1985 auction of two paintings that were in the style of 18th century
master George Stubbs.
   The paintings, renderings of foxhounds, were sold by the auction
house for $1,500.
   They were purchased by an art dealer, who subsequently sold them
through the Sotheby's auction house as the work of Stubbs for
$162,000. They were subsequently sold again for an undisclosed price
to American multi-millionaire Paul Mellon.
   Brown ruled that it wasn't necessary for the court to determine
whether the paintings were in fact Stubbs' work.
   ``Their error lay not in failing to make a positive Stubbs
attribution _ they did not themselves have the expertise to do that
any more than to the contrary _ but rather in their failure to spot
the potential in these paintings,'' he said.
   An art expert testified during the trial that she could not
verify the authenticity of the paintings, but said there was an 85
percent chance they were painted not by Stubbs, but by a 19th
century admirer.
   Mrs. Luxmoore-May said she was ``absolutely delighted'' with the
$200,000 judgement. She said she went to the auctioneers because her
husband was a former director.
   ``I would prefer to have the pictures on my wall knowing they
were by Stubbs than have the damages,'' she said.
   Mrs. Luxmoore-May, a magistrate, testified that she was given the
paintings in 1948 by a family friend. But she said she and her
husband never liked them.
   Paul Thomas, the expert at Messenger May Baverstock, said he
thought the paintings were badly drawn and without quality, so he
valued them at $54 to $90.
   Brown said the Luxmoore-Mays were ``mortified'' to read on the
front page of The Times of London some months later that the
pictures had been bought by Spinks, fine art dealers, for $162,000.
   Spinks later sold them to Mellon for an undisclosed sum.
   Mrs. Luxmoore-May, 66, sued for breach of contract and failure to
exercise reasonable skill and care in its valuation and sale in
October 1985 in Godalming, 35 miles southwest of London.
   Stubbs, who lived from 1724 to 1806, is regarded as England's
finest animal painter.

   Thousands made a pilgrimage to Dealey Plaza to
honor John F. Kennedy with prayers and tears and by dropping
bouquets and Kennedy half-dollars in the street where the president
was assassinated 25 years ago.
   ``It's just something to remember him by,'' Alvin Marin of
suburban Farmers Branch said Tuesday as he laid down the crucifix he
said he had grasped upon hearing of Kennedy's assassination. ``This
is very emotional.''
   Howard Hartog of Edgerton, Minn., drove more than 900 miles for
the anniversary, then was among the first to drop flowers at the
approximate spot by a grassy knoll where the president was gunned
down.
   ``I found myself fighting back tears,'' said Hartog, moments
after leaving a red rose. ``That's where the uplift came, from the
spontaneity that occurred when that first flower was dropped.''
   Although Dallas held no official ceremony, about 2,500 people
gathered along Elm Street to pass the anniversary hour of Kennedy's
death as he rode by in a motorcade. At 12:29 p.m. _ the time of the
fatal shots _ mourners began dropping bouquets of flowers,
half-dollars and other memorabilia on the street.
   ``It was a show of camaraderie,'' Hartog said.
   The flowers remained on the street and passing motorists were
careful to avoid them, backing up traffic downtown. A note attached
to one bouquet said, ``After 25 years, we still love you, John.''
Another said, ``We still miss you _ Nov. 22.'' About 20 people
clapsed hands in a loose chain along the motorcade route.
   At the flower-draped stone memorial about 200 yards away, where
one card read, ``Dallas Loves JFK Too!'' a few people knelt in
prayer. Others snapped pictures of the memorial and the Texas School
Book Depository Building, where police found Lee Harvey Oswald's
rifle.
   The building's sixth floor, where authorities believe the shots
were fired, is being converted to a museum by the Dallas County
Historical Foundation and is expected to open Feb. 20, President's
Day.
   Elsewhere, members of the Kennedy family observed the anniversary
in mostly private services. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis attended a
private Mass in New York City along with her son, John, and
daughter, Caroline. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., placed a white
rose on a monument honoring his brother n Runnymede, England.
   Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the late president's sister, visited his
grave and that of her brother Robert, at Arlington National Cemetery
in Virginia and said she hopes people remember ``the high points of
his life, the laughter and the vision.''
   The lack of official ceremonies in Dallas and elsewhere were
mostly in deference to a request from the president's family his
birthday on May 29 be marked instead of the assassination.
   However, Jean Hill of Dallas said she had something important to
impart to her class of 50 third-grade students who visited the site.
   ``Although this was a traumatic event, I want them to feel they
are a part of America's history,'' she said. ``We're here because
this is an important place in Dallas, an important place in
history.''
   Ms. Hill said she had been waiting at Dealey Plaza on Nov. 22,
1963, to see the president's motorcade. She jumped from the curb and
hollered at Kennedy to turn her way for a picture, then the shots
rang out.
   ``I could have touched the car when I jumped out into the
street,'' she said. The anniversary ``is bringing all of those
anxiety feelings and traumatic feelings back to me. The nightmares
are coming back.''
   At Parkland Memorial Hospital, where the mortally wounded
president was taken, a panel of 11 employees recounted their
experiences from the tragic day with about 200 hospital staff
members.
   ``It was as hopeless as anything we ever worked on,'' said
Charles Baxter, assistant professor of surgery and director of the
emergency room at the time. ``The emotion in the room would have
said to try and do something, even though it was a hopeless
situation.''

<HEAD>Besieged Government Devalues Currency By 50 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attempt to deal with a shrinking economy
and runaway inflation, the government has devalued Peru's currency
by 50 percent and imposed other severe austerity measures including
food price increases.
   Also Tuesday, leftist rebels launched a mortar attack on the Lima
headquarters of the national security police and raided an isolated
mountain town, capping a four-day wave of violence that has killed
41 people.
   Though the country's two main leftist insurgencies are a serious
problem for the government of President Alan Garcia, they do not
pose as daunting a threat as Peru's grave economic crisis.
   Announcing the devaluation of the inti, Economy Minister Abel
Salinas also said the government would eliminate subsidies for basic
food products in stages over the next six months because it lacks
the money to finance them.
   The first reduction will be implemented immediately and will
double the prices of some food staples, Salinas said in a nationwide
television address.
   Severe economic measures implemented by the government in early
September, including an 86 percent currency devaluation, did not
succeed in reducing the country's huge deficit, said Salinas.
   Independent economists estimate the deficit has since increased
from 16 percent to 18 percent of the gross national product.
Inflation is expected to reach an annual 1,500 percent this year.
   Salinas said the curency's official exchange rate was being
devalued from 250 intis per dollar to 500 intis per dollar to boost
exports and bring in badly needed dollars.
   The inti traded Tuesday on the parallel market _ a legal
free-market currency exchange _ for 625 to the dollar.
   To offset the measures' impact on the poor, the government
decreed an increase in the monthly minimum wage from 15,000 to
24,000 intis.
   Sporadic food rioting broke out after the September austerity
package was announced.
   At one point, Garcia offered to resign but was persuaded by
leaders of his populist Aprista Party to stay, according to senior
government officials.
   Garcia took office in 1985 and gained international attention
when he defiantly set a ceiling on the country's foreign debt
payments equal to 10 percent of export earnings.
   He used the money to generate record economic growth of 8.5
percent in 1986 and 6.7 percent in 1987. But Peru has exhausted its
hard currency reserves and the government has said the economy will
shrink by at least 6 percent this year.
   Authorities said one policeman was killed, three were wounded and
two were missing Tuesday in the raid on the mountain community of
Cotahuasi, 335 miles southeast of Lima. They said rebels of the
Maoist-inspired Shining Path guerrilla movement carried out the raid.
   No one was reported injured in the Lima attack by the pro-Cuba
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.

   The dark, ominous-looking stealth bomber
was rolled into the light of day after more than 10 years of
secrecy-shrouded development, with the Air Force secretary declaring
it essential to the nation's defense.
   The black and gray boomerang-shaped B-2, designed and built by
Northrop Corp., was towed ponderously out of a hangar Tuesday to
cheers and the accompaniment of ``The Stealth Fanfare,'' an original
composition played by an Air Force Band.
   ``We can't afford to be without this program,'' Air Force
Secretary Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge, Jr. declared to a select
crowd of about 2,000 that included members of Congress, military
brass and the B-2 labor force.
   Responding to critics who contend the stealth bomber is an
expensive, unneeded weapons system that could destabilize arms
control efforts, Aldridge said the B-2 is a key to compelling the
Soviet Union to adhere to current and future arms agreements.
   ``This program is essential,'' Aldridge told reporters after the
unveiling at the Mojave Desert plant where the B-1 bomber and space
shuttle are built. ``It's not destabilizing.''
   He said the mission of the B-2, which is designed to slip past
enemy radar defenses and drop nuclear bombs, is to make the Soviets
realize they could not protect their most precious assets, such as
hardened command posts and moveable missiles.
   ``That's the whole idea behind the flexibility of a manned bomber
force,'' he said.
   While the B-1B bomber is considered sufficient by the Air Force
to meet the current Soviet threat, Aldridge insisted the
revolutionary technology of the B-2 is needed for the future.
   The stealth bomber is a subsonic, all-altitude flying wing formed
from non-metallic composite materials that are intended to let it
absorb radar transmissions rather than reflect them. Its shape and
lack of sharp angles also help make it nearly invisible to radar.
Air Force officials say it makes about the same impression on a
radar screen as a bird.
   The plane steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than
with a tail. Nobody was allowed to see the B-2 from the rear,
presumably because revealing the design of its engine exhaust system
might help enemy detection efforts.
   Aldridge said even U.S. radar systems cannot track the stealth
bomber and that the Pentagon believes the Soviets to be without any
effective counter to it, or a stealth program of their own.
   ``I am not aware of any Soviet program like this,'' he said.
   The bomber, built to accommodate a crew of two or three, has not
yet flown. In the weeks ahead, it will undergo high-speed taxi tests
and engine evaluations. Air Force officials declined to say when the
B-2 would take to the air, saying it would fly, ``only when it is
ready.''
   The budget arm of Congress, the General Accounting Office, has
estimated potential program costs for a fleet of 132 stealth bombers
sought by the Air Force at $68.5 billion, or about $500 million
each, twice the cost of a B-1B.
   The Union of Concerned Scientists has called the B-2 a costly
weapons system that could possibly panic the Soviets and cause the
opposite of the desired deterrent effect. The Air Force has disputed
this assertion, contending it is important for the Soviets to
realize a weapon exists that could retaliate against their most
prized assets.
   The program to develop stealth aircraft was initiated by
then-President Jimmy Carter and sustained in secrecy throughout the
Reagan administration.

<HEAD>Whooping Cough Outbreak Claims Infant, But Amish Resist Vaccination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN F. BONFATTI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONEWANGO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outbreak of whooping cough has claimed
the life of one infant in western New York's Amish community but has
done little to break down the conservative Christian group's
resistance to inoculation.
   During the past three weeks, the number of confirmed cases of the
disease, which federal records indicate is fatal in eight of 1,000
cases among infants under age 6 months, has risen from six to 33. A
3-month-old infant died Oct. 31.
   The outbreak, the second this decade in the community, has health
officials worried about the rest of the 1,200 to 1,500 Amish who
live in an area about 70 miles south of Buffalo. A vaccine has
nearly eliminated whooping cough in the nation's general population,
but most of the Amish avoid vaccinations and other conventional
medical treatments.
   ``It's a very large concern,'' said Mary Anne Power, Cattaraugus
County supervising public health nurse. ``Any public health official
would be concerned about an epidemic in such a large non-vaccinated
community.''
   Power said she is afraid ``the peak of the epidemic hasn't
occurred yet.''
   The disease hasn't reached Neil Hershberger, 26, or his wife and
three children, but like most Amish here, he's in no hurry to have
his children vaccinated.
   Instead, he said, ``We would keep them (the children) away from
people that have it.''
   That philosophy echoes the general stance the ``Plain Folk'' take
toward the non-Amish population, whom they refer to as ``the
English.''
   A group formed in the 17th century as an offshoot of the
Mennonites, the Amish are known for their severely plain clothing
and avoidance of modern conveniences like electricity, telephones
and motorized vehicles. They subsist by farming, producing lumber
and selling homemade goods such as quilts, baked goods and cheese.
   Although friendly and willing to speak, most don't want their
names used, out of modesty.
   ``Their outlook is `I'm a member of the community and I'll talk,
but I shouldn't be boastful or proud,''' explained Lee Zook, an
Amish expert and professor at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa.
   Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a regular occurrence in the
community. In 1982, there were 216 reported cases, but no deaths.
   All of the Amish interviewed said they remembered having the
disease as children, and since they survived, many don't believe it
is dangerous. Their comments also reflected the community's general
belief in the virtue of self-sufficiency and faith in the power of
God.
   ``I had it. I was only a couple of months old,'' said one young
Amish man with a fiery red beard who, along with eight of his
friends, was building a home on property he'd just bought. ``It
wasn't that bad for me, the way my mother told me. I took some
homemade remedies. I don't know what it was.
   ``In a way, I kind of feel if a child is supposed to die, why
don't it die?''
   Another man said of inoculation, ``The way the people feel,
you're not relying on God. You're relying on people.''
   The Amish will seek medical treatment when it is clearly needed.
But, as a nurse at Conewango Valley Medical Center said, ``When they
do come to us, it seems like the disease is progressed so far it's
in the later stages.''
   The DPT (diptheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine, according to Dr.
Steven Wassilak at the federal Centers for Disease Control, has
reduced the incidence of whooping cough ``from universal infection
to about 4,000 cases a year'' since its development in the 1940s.
   Still, outbreaks occur every year. Already this year, one Arizona
child has died in an outbreak in which 268 cases have been verified.
And in Idaho, there have been 325 reported cases this year.
   The vaccine has proven safe for nearly all, but Wassilak noted
reports have linked it to brain damage in a few cases.
   Cattaraugus County Health Commissioner Dr. James D. Garvey says
the reported side-effects may contribute to the resistance to
inoculation among the Amish.
   ``I think they know about that,'' he said.
   Still, there are signs that attitudes are changing slowly. Garvey
said county health nurses have gone door-to-door and vaccinated
nearly 40 people. During the last epidemic, only six children were
immunized.
   ``I think they see that it can be more serious (than they
thought),'' he said, ``probably because of this one unfortunate
death.''
   And Hershberger said if he and his wife had an infant now, ``I
think we would get the shots.''

<HEAD>Santas Learn How-Tos of Ho-Ho-Ho-ing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If would-be Kris Kringles have a love for
children, a twinkle in their eye and a desire to spread holiday
cheer, Santa school teacher Dick Lewis can teach them the rest.
   ``Screaming kids, shin-kickers, hecklers,'' Lewis said. ``We
teach them to deal with everything.''
   Everything from the proper way to wear their Santa hats to how to
chortle like a pro, said Lewis, who trains Santas for Western
Temporary Services.
   Retirees, character actors and a 19-year-old college student
donned red velveteen suits and ersatz beards at the John Wanamaker
department store and got the how-tos of ho-ho-ho-ing from Lewis on
Tuesday, three days before the start of the Christmas shopping
season.
   A Santa himself before he joined Western, Lewis has an eye for
the compassion and demeanor that makes a good Claus.
   ``We want people with a sincere desire to make children happy at
Christmas time,'' he said.
   Despite the professional, almost production-line approach to
training Santas, and the commercialism of the department-store
Kringles, Lewis advised his 10 students to remember their
responsibility to uphold the spirit of the holiday.
   ``These days and times there are going to be a lot of children
who are not going to have a happy holiday,'' Lewis said. ``At that
point in time, we need to be that special moment.''
   The temporary help company trains and employs 2,500 to 3,000
Santas each year for department stores, promotional and community
events throughout the country.
   Tuesday's training program, which lasted less than an hour but
usually runs longer, gives the basics of being Santa:
   _How to dress the part. Cap tassle always in front, beard hooked
around the top of the head, so it doesn't slip, two pairs of white
gloves, to be washed each day.
   _How to laugh in Santa's deep voice without scaring the child. No
loud ho-ho-ho's, but a low chortle coming from the stomach.
   _How to deal with difficult questions. Little girls often ask for
a little brother, Lewis said, and ``some kids are going to ask for a
bed.'' One child in Pittsburgh asked ``for Daddy to stop beating
me,'' he said.
   _A reminder to protect the shins when kids come flying up to the
chair, but always say ``ouch!'' when they tug on the beard.
   _And one of the cardinal rules _ always stay in character. ``No
matter what happens, you, each one of you, are the real Santa.''
   There were also tips from St. Nicks like Larry Dowd, who after 30
years as a Santa no longer needs artificial padding to play the role.
   ``I think I fill the suit out more,'' he said when asked if he'd
become a better Claus over the years. ``I used to use a pillow.''
   The kids, however, haven't changed at all, which is why Dowd will
come in before his regular night job supervising a custodial crew
and work a six-hour shift, talking with as many as 200 children.
   ``The kids really light up your life,'' said Dowd, 50. ``That's
the part of Christmas I really like.''
   Dowd and another Claus, Ned Holbrook, agreed Santas are born, not
made.
   ``I just think that you either have the natural training to be
one or you don't,'' said Holbrook, a character actor from
Philadelphia.
   But Holbrook, who said he prepares for being Santa as he would
for a dramatic role, is sometimes caught off-guard, such as the time
a retarded woman sat on his lap and asked him to bring back her dead
father.
   She gave him a kiss after his best attempt to deal with her wish.
   ``Now that's faith,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Reconsidering Trying to Determine Fate of Two Freed
Whales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are reconsidering whether to
try to determine the fate of two California gray whales freed from
the ice off Alaska's northern coast last month after a three-week
international effort.
   Officials decided against attaching radio transmitters to the
whales, in part because many did not want to find out in case the
mammals died soon after the $1 million rescue effort. They were
battered and bleeding when freed and had to navigate 200 miles of
ice-clogged waters to get to open seas.
   But now, scientists are considering distributing posters of the
whales to California tour boat operators in hopes that it will help
someone spot the animals, said Jim Harvey, a whale expert at the
National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.
   The main benefit would be to satisfy public curiosity about the
fate of the whales, Harvey said Tuesday.
   But he said any knowledge gained might be useful in determining
whether to undertake similar rescue efforts in the future, and
whether techniques developed in Barrow were effective.
   Scientists have found no trace of the whales since a Soviet
icebreaker carved an escape path late last month.
   Harvey emphasized that no decision has been taken yet and that
the chances of spotting the whales are slim in any event.
   Scientists were able to photograph only the whales' heads as they
surfaced to breathe in holes cut in the ice off the coast near
Barrow last month. But in open water, usually only a whale's back
and tail can be seen when it surfaces.
   ``They would just about have to swim up to a boat and stick their
heads out of the water to be identified,'' Harvey said.
   The whales also may not go as far south as California, where tour
boats take people out to view whales.
   Ron Morris, a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist who
coordinated the rescue effort, said some of the endangered gray
whales stop near Vancouver, B.C., and San Francisco rather than
going all the way to breeding grounds off Baja California. Harvey
said young whales in particular, like the two that were freed, often
don't make the full migration.
   Assuming the whales made it to open seas, it could take them some
time to reach tour-boat territory. With an average migration speed
of 3{ mph, Morris estimated they are still somewhere in the Gulf of
Alaska off the state's southern coast.
   Morris and Harvey remained optimistic that the whales are still
alive despite the beating they suffered because the animals can lose
a significant amount of blood and survive.
   ``I don't see why they wouldn't make it,'' Morris said. ``I still
tend to be optimistic.''

<HEAD>Discovered Link Between Man And Ape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raymond Dart, a pioneering
anthropologist whose once-controversial discovery of a link between
man and ape is now widely accepted, died after a three-week illness.
He was 95.
   Dart died of a brain hemorrhage Tuesday at a clinic near
Johannesburg, said a colleague from the University of the
Witwatersrand, Professor Phillip Tobias.
   Dart became widely known in 1925, when he publicized his claim
that a skull found in South Africa's Cape Province came from an
ape-like, pre-human form of man that he called Australopithecus.
   For decades, his theory was viewed skeptically by most of his
professional peers. Some critics said the skull was that of a
chimpanzee, and Dart was denounced by religious groups who objected
to the theory of evolution.
   But later work by Dart and discoveries by other
paleoanthropologists in Africa eventually confirmed his theories.
   ``Dart is the grand old man of fossil-man research,'' Donald
Ortner, curator of physical anthropology at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, said a few years ago. ``His early
observations on the evolutionary significance of
Australopithecus-Africanus were highly controversial at the time he
made them, but since then have been generally accepted.''
   Dart was born Feb. 4, 1893, in Brisbane, Australia, and graduated
from the Sydney University Medical School in 1917. In 1923, he was
hired as professor of anatomy at the University of the Witwatersrand
in Johannesburg, where he taught until 1958. For 18 years, he was
dean of the university's medical school.
   The skull that brought him notoriety was recovered from a
limestone cave at Taung, on the edge of the Kalahari desert. After
weeks of examination, Dart concluded that it belonged to a child of
an ape-related species that had moved further in a human direction
than previously known species.
   Tobias, an internationally recognized anatomist, wrote in 1983:
``Dart's appreciation and interpretation of the hominoid-like traits
of Astralopithecus represent the single most important breakthrough
in paleoanthropology of the 20th century, next to which all the
other African discoveries represented a mere filling-in.''

roads as families and friends meet to celebrate Thanksgiving.
   The National Safety Council said between 450 and 550 people may
die in traffic accidents during the period, which for counting
purposes extends from 6 p.m. Wednesday to midnight Sunday local time.
   Council statisticians said about 390 people could be expected to
be killed on the highways during a four-day non-holiday period this
time of year.
   Last year, there were 494 highway deaths during the four-day
Thanksgiving period. The deadliest was in 1968, when 764 people were
killed.

<TEXT>
   The Tax Court of Canada has ruled that a Montreal
prostitute must pay tax on income of about $1 million earned from
1974 to 1981.
   The court on Tuesday dismissed Erna Dietrich's appeal and said
she must pay more than $70,000 in penalties for not declaring her
real income.
   Ms. Dietrich declared income of $41,000 for the eight-year
period. But Revenue Canada found she made $234,312 in 1980 alone.
   The Canadian revenue service said her net worth rose from $11,273
in 1973 to more than $1 million by 1982. By then, she was resorting
to Grand Cayman tax shelters, the court said.
   The revenue service said she was convicted six to eight times in
the period on prostitution-related charges.
   Also on Tuesday, the Federal Court ruled that the money a
plainclothes detective spends on plain clothes can be deducted for
tax purposes.

   About 20 turkeys that survived a
slaughterhouse-bound truck wreck have been adopted, and animal
rights advocates are looking for homes for 20 others that gained a
Thanksgiving reprieve because of the crash.
   People adopting the turkeys ``are just being nice enough to let
them live out their lives,'' said Pamela Nielsen of the animal
rights group Creature Comfort, adding that a turkey can live to be 8
to 10 years old. ``It's a compassionate time of year.''
   Eleven other birds that lived through the crash will play the
traditional role of main course Thursday. Those birds apparently
already had been pledged when the adoption idea was proposed, Ms.
Nielsen said.
   Following Friday's crash, which occurred on the way to a Waco
slaughterhouse, the Humane Society took 51 turkeys from that
shipment to the Skyline Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center east of
Austin.
   The center had planned to feed its 60 residents and donate
remaining birds to the needy, said Kay Tillman, assistant
manager-director of the center.
   ``We're a non-profit organization,'' Ms. Tillman said. ``We were
delighted to be offered 50 turkeys. That wouldn't have just provided
for Thanksgiving. It would have provided for Christmas and all next
year.''
   But Ms. Nielsen and other animal rights activists gained the
reprieve for most of the birds.
   ``They seemed to feel as strongly about their cause as we do
about ours,'' Ms. Tillman said.
   ``We're in the business of helping people,'' she said. ``They're
in the business of saving animals. If anyone is that dedicated to
anything, you might as well help them.''
   Ms. Nielsen said she hoped the public would donate food and
useful items to the treatment center to make up for the lost poultry.
   People who have offered homes to 20 birds generally have farms
with other animals, Ms. Nielsen said. She said she's confident none
of the turkeys will be eaten because the adopting parties were
contacted through vegetarians and animal rights advocates.

<HEAD>U.S. Orthodox Rabbis Split with Israeli Orthodox Position</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main U.S. alliance of Orthodox rabbis
reportedly has split with the Orthodox religious parties in Israel
that have been calling for a change in the legal definition of who
is a Jew.
   In a telegram sent Tuesday to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, the Rabbinical Council of America said it ``supports removal
of this issue from the political agenda,'' The New York Times
reported today.
   The council, a moderate Orthodox group, said it was acting ``to
preserve the unity and support of the American Jewish community with
and for Israel.''
   The council says is represents about 1,000 Orthodox rabbis, or 90
percent of those with major congregations across the country. It is
the first Orthodox group to state that the attempt to legally define
Jewishness by Israel should be dropped.
   Israel's Orthodox parties hold the balance of power in the
formation of a government in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, and
have pressed for a change in the Law of Return. The law now grants
all Jews immediate Israeli citizenship.
   The religious parties want it changed to say that the only
converts to Judaism eligible for Israeli citizenship must be
converted according to Orthodox religious law.
   The telegram, signed by the council's president, Rabbi Max
Schreier, and its executive vice president, Rabbi Binyamin Walfish,
said that they support the primacy of Orthodox conversions, but that
standards for conversion belong ``in the hands of the rabbinate and
not in the secular Knesset.''
   The council's position puts it in conflict with the Lubavitcher
Hasidim of Brooklyn, whose grand rabbi, Menachem M. Schneerson, has
been a force behind the effort to change the Israeli law.
   A study last year by the Council of Jewish Federations found that
9 percent of America's 5 million to 6 million Jews identify
themselves as Orthodox, 34 percent as Conservative and 30 percent as
Reform. Twenty-seven percent expressed no affiliation.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Anti-IRA Measures; Sale Of State-Owned
Utilities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outlining its legislative program for the coming
year, the government announced new moves against the IRA that will
include making candidates in Northern Ireland sign an oath
renouncing violence.
   The program, comprising 16 proposed bills, was read out by Queen
Elizabeth II on Tuesday at the traditional opening of Parliament in
the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber.
   The speech also spelled out government plans to sell off the
state-owned water and electricity utilities. Denounced by the
opposition Labor Party, the sales are the biggest and most
controversial of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's massive program
of selling off state-owned assets to private enterprise and will
raise an estimated $55 billion.
   The program detailed in the queen's speech is the tenth written
by Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government.
   One proposed bill would give authorities wide powers to probe and
seize suspected Irish Republican Army funds.
   ``The government is determined never to give in to the
terrorist,'' Mrs. Thatcher declared in the House of Commons later
Tuesday, launching a six-day debate on the legislative program.
   Despite protests from the opposition and from pro-IRA or moderate
Catholic groups in Northern Ireland, most of the new measures are
virtually certain of passage by the 650-member lower chamber, where
Mrs. Thatcher has a 101-seat margin over all the other parties
combined.
   Under the proposed measures, state investigators will be able to
demand from banks details of accounts through which the IRA is
suspected of moving cash from legitimate businesses or racketeering.
   Under the proposed measures, all Northern Ireland election
candidates will have to sign an oath rejecting violence.
   Other politicians or members of the public will be able to sue
those who don't sign and get them banned from office.
   Officials said despite the law providing for the proposed
non-violence pledge _ which is aimed at members of the outlawed
IRA's legal political front, Sinn Fein _ candidates can say what
they like during election campaigns.
   ``Further repression, the increasing erosion of our few remaining
civil liberties and British efforts to marginalize Sinn Fein are not
the way to resolve the conflict,'' said Sinn Fein spokesman Danny
Morrison.
   The new measure follows a ban this fall on broadcast interviews
with members of the IRA and 10 other militant Catholic and
Protestant groups in Northern Ireland.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to end British rule in
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite it with the 95
percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch barely looked at former Miss
America Bess Myerson, his former close political ally, and said
almost as little during his testimony at her divorce-fixing
conspiracy trial.
   Miss Myerson's attorney got Koch to concede, however, that a
previous sworn statement he made was ``inaccurate'' because he had
forgotten about one conversation with an aide.
   Koch was unusually subdued and smiled little during most of his
testimony Tuesday in a packed federal courtroom.
   Koch appointed Miss Myerson as city cultural affairs commissioner
in 1983. She resigned in 1987 after a report commissioned by Koch
accused her of ``serious misconduct'' in the hiring of a judge's
daughter as her personal assistant.
   Miss Myerson, 64; her lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43; and
former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 75, are on trial
for an alleged scheme to fix support payments in Capasso's divorce.
   Miss Myerson, is accused of giving a city job to the judge's
daughter, Sukhreet Gabel, to influence Mrs. Gabel, who later slashed
Capasso's temporary alimony and child support payments.
   Koch barely glanced at Miss Myerson as he testified for the
prosecution, but Miss Myerson stared intently at her former boss
from the defense table.
   Koch's testimony centered on a letter he received from Miss
Myerson on Oct. 19, 1983, explaining the hiring of Sukhreet Gabel.
   In the letter, written the day after a New York Post report about
Ms. Gabel's hiring, Miss Myerson contended that nothing improper was
done and that most of the decisions in the divorce case were already
made when Miss Gabel was hired.
   ``The only information that I had (about Ms. Gabel's hiring) was
the (Post) article and the letter,'' said Koch.
   Myerson lawyer Frederick Hafetz grilled the mayor about when a
top aide, Herbert Rickman, told him about Miss Gabel's hiring.
   Koch testified that his first recollection of discussing the
subject with Rickman was in 1986.
   But Hafetz pointed out that in a sworn statement to prosecutors
in September 1987, Koch said he had not discussed the Gabel hiring
with Rickman before June 1987.
   When Hafetz asked Koch if his statements last year were ``false,
incorrect, inaccurate or misleading,'' Koch replied: ``I am saying
they were inaccurate.''
   ``To the best of my recollection,'' Koch said later, ``now or at
any time, I had two conversations with Herb Rickman on this matter.''
   The first was in 1986, he said. The second in 1987, when the
mayor's commission made its report on Miss Myerson. He said he had
forgotten about the 1986 conversation when he made the statement to
prosecutors in 1987.
   Rickman testified earlier in the trial that he had gone to see
Koch in 1983 to angrily denounce the Post article, which quoted a
Myerson aide as saying Rickman had recommended Ms. Gabel as a job
candidate.
   The Myerson aide has admitted misleading the Post reporter.
   Koch, however, said he did not recall the 1983 conversation with
Rickman although he added: ``It could've occurred. I just have no
recollection.''
   Last year, Koch said he no longer considers Miss Myerson a
friend, but under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney David
Lawrence, the mayor said he ``had and has a high regard'' for Miss
Myerson, whom he described as ``very important in the (mayoral) race
I won in 1977.''

<TEXT>
   A retired Navy firefighter says he was
unable to break through an intense fire that shot up his house's
only staircase, killing his two children, a niece and two nephews.
   Samuel Todaro and his wife, Eleanor, fled the fire unharmed
Tuesday, but said they had no chance of saving the five children
from the fatal inferno that trapped them in upstairs bedrooms of the
wooden, frame house.
   ``We heard a big pop and then we saw it. We looked over and we
saw this glow through our bedroom door,'' said Todaro, who was
asleep with his wife in a downstairs room. ``We ran out and started
yelling at the kids.''
   ``It doesn't seem like it happened. It seems like they're still
here but they're not,'' Mrs. Todaro said.
   The children were trapped by smoke and flames that shot up the
home's only staircase from the living room, said Fire Chief Bill
Carter. The staircase was the only exit for the children, who ranged
in age from 3-year-old twins to 15, he said.
   Todaro said he attempted to get to the sleeping children through
a second-floor balcony door, but he was driven back by intense heat.
   ``I'm a retired Navy firefighter,'' he said. ``I knew how far I
could get. I'd have died if I could have saved them.''
   A firefighter tried to reach the youngsters by ladder but also
was unsuccessful, Carter said.
   Investigators checked electrical wiring and the living room
fireplace as possible causes. Arson isn't suspected, Carter said.
The 11-room house, built at least 60 years ago, was gutted and not
equipped with smoke detectors.
   The house's gas furnace wasn't turned on, the fire chief said.
The couple had built a fire in the living room fireplace that night,
but Mrs. Todaro said they made sure flames were out when they went
to bed.
   Killed were twins Stephen and Stephanie Baumgartner, their
15-year-old brother Christopher Baumgartner, 12-year-old Amy Todaro
and her 7-year-old brother Guy Todaro, Carter said.
   All five died of smoke inhalation, but the twins also were
burned, the fire chief said.
   The Todaros said they were legal guardians of the Baumgartner
youngsters. Their mother is Todaro's sister, Barbara Gardner, who
also lives in Elizabethton.
   A funeral for the children was scheduled for Saturday at
Hathaway-Percy Funeral Home, across the street from the gutted house.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer seeking to determine the fate of
D.B. Cooper claims to have found part of the parachute the legendary
hijacker used to escape from a jetliner 17 years ago Friday with a
$200,000 ransom.
   Richard Tosaw, of Ceres, Calif., said a diver he hired discovered
an 18-inch-wide ``pilot'' parachute Monday in the Columbia River
about 5 miles west of Vancouver, which lies across the river from
Portland, Ore.
   The parachute, which deploys a diver's main parachute, was found
about a mile upstream from the spot where $5,800 of Cooper's ransom
washed up in 1980, he said.
   The 63-year-old attorney said the discovery indicates that Cooper
probably landed in the river and died, Tosaw said.
   ``Everybody's got to be somewhere and that guy is in the river,''
he said.
   But the man who packed Cooper's parachute said Tuesday he doubts
the pilot parachute came from the hijacker.
   ``I think it is publicity,'' said Earl Cossey of Woodinville,
Wash., near Seattle.
   ``I'm kind of suspicious. Every year about D.B. Cooper's
anniversary they seem to find something. Why don't they find
something in July?'' Cossey said. He said the parachute sounds like
it is of an earlier generation than the one he packed for the
hijacker.
   Cooper used the name of Dan Cooper when he boarded a
Seattle-bound Northwest Air Lines 727 in Portland on Nov. 24, 1971,
the day before Thanksgiving. News accounts initially called him D.B.
Cooper, though, and the moniker stuck.
   After takeoff, Cooper displayed what an attendant said looked
like dynamite and demanded four parachutes and $200,000, which he
picked up in Seattle. After the plane took off for Reno, Nev.,
Cooper jumped out and hasn't been seen or heard from since.
   Tosaw, who has written a book titled ``D.B. Cooper, Dead or
Alive,'' said he believes Cooper's body is trapped on one of the
jetties of telephone poles built into the river about every
half-mile to prevent shore erosion. The pilot parachute was found
behind one such jetty in about 20 feet of water, he said.
   Curtis Rainey, 33, the diver who made the discovery, planned to
show the pilot parachute to Cossey over Thanksgiving.
   Cossey, a licensed parachute rigger whom Northwest hired to
provide gear for Cooper, said pilot parachutes don't bear any
identifying marks or registration numbers, unlike the main parachute.
   ``There are probably a million of those (pilot parachutes) in the
world,'' he said from his home.
   John Eyer, assistant in charge of the Seattle FBI office, said
Tosaw hadn't informed the agency of the discovery.
   Tosaw began looking for Cooper seven years ago and said he always
times his searches to coincide with the hijacking's anniversary. He
said he will resume the hunt next year.
   ``I'd like to fish him out of there on Thanksgiving Day,'' he
said.

   The country's fifth-largest turkey
processor and distributor is recalling thousands of its ``Family
Tradition'' turkeys from seven Northeast states after three grocers
discovered spoiled giblets and necks in some birds.
   No illnesses have been reported and the U.S. Agriculture
Department has been notified, Norbest Inc. spokesman Mike Korologos
said by telephone from the company's Salt Lake City headquarters
Tuesday.
   The turkeys, which carry the number P-2487 on the metal package
closures, were processed under a packaging agreement with a Columbia
City, Ind., plant, Korologos said. They were distributed to stores
in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Connecticut, New
Hampshire and in Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, he said.
   Bennett S. Berman, executive vice president of the meat division
of Roger Williams Foods in Cranston, a Norbest distributor, said he
had distributed about 900 boxes of turkeys, each containing two to
four birds, to ``mostly small stores where we could put our fingers
right on it.''
   ``I have recovered ... 90 percent of them,'' he said, estimating
the rest would be recovered today.
   He said one store apparently had sold several boxes of birds to
someone for a raffle or similar event and those were being tracked
down.
   Berman said a grocer complained about a bad bird Saturday but he
did not become concerned immediately because ``we get these calls
every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas'' when the birds jam
grocery shelves and often are improperly refrigerated.
   When a grocer found a bad box of turkeys, however, Berman said he
immediately notified Norbest on Monday and began recalling the
birds, which are being shipped to a Boston-area cold storage
warehouse for federal inspection.
   Korologos said the turkeys being recalled, which weigh from 6 to
20 pounds each, amount to less than 0.2 percent of Norbest's total
production.
   ``Norbest does not forsee any serious health problems, but
ordered the removal to avoid the remote possibility of illness to
consumers,'' he said. Consumers who purchased the turkeys should
return them to the place of purchase for a refund, Korologos said.

   A train smashed into a car at a
fog-shrouded railroad crossing, killing a couple and three of their
six young children and injuring the other three, authorities said.
   No one on the freight train was injured in Tuesday's crash on a
rural gravel road about five miles west of this southeast North
Dakota city, the state Highway Patrol said.
   The engineer of the westbound Burlington Northern train blew the
engine's whistle before crossing the intersection, said Highway
Patrolman Roger Haga. But fog covered the area, and the driver of
the northbound car apparently did not see or hear the freight, Haga
said.
   The parents and three of the children, all of whom were less than
9 years old, were pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said.
Two of the surviving children were taken to Mercy Hospital in Valley
City.
   Another who wandered away from the wreck was found about an hour
later, and was taken to the hospital, Haga said.
   A 5-year-old girl was transfereed to a Fargo hospital, where she
was in critical condition Tuesday night, said Mercy Hospital
spokeswoman Connie Reed. Two boys, ages 4 and 6, were in stable
condition at Mercy.
   The victims' identities were not released. No other details were
available.

   Five gunmen wearing wrinkly masks with
gray hair and big noses stormed a jewelry store and made off under
cover of smoke bombs with nearly $4 million in rare and unusual
diamond pieces, authorities said.
   ``At first I thought it was a joke,'' salesman Salomon Romano
said after Tuesday night's robbery. ``It was frantic _ you just
don't think straight. In five seconds, you know what's going on.''
   The robbers walked through the front door of the H.T. Stuart &
Co. jewelry store in the Town Center Mall, disarmed a security guard
and pointed automatic weapons at three employees.
   As one of the robbers stood guard outside the store, brandishing
an automatic rifle, the others plucked exotic diamond necklaces,
earrings and rings from two display cases, said Bob Ferrell, a Palm
Beach County Sheriff's Office spokesman.
   Among the $4 million in jewelry reported stolen was a diamond
necklace worth more than $1 million.
   Toting their loot in laundry bags, the robbers set off smoke
bombs to thwart their pursuers as they ran from the store, then fled
the mall in a van, witnesses said.
   Minutes after the robbery, the thieves fired on a deputy's squad
car, shattering its window, but leaving the officer unharmed,
authorities said.
   The van was found later in a nearby parking lot with the masks, a
loaded automatic pistol and some of the stolen jewels left behind,
authorities said.
   Store managers seemed certain Tuesday that the robbers cased the
store before the heist, because they took only the most valuable
pieces, leaving the other display cases untouched.
   ``They came and took the most unusual pieces we had in the
store,'' said Kanti Gopalji, the manager. ``It seemed like these
people knew what windows to look in.''
   Five security cameras in the store recorded the robbery and the
video tape was being reviewed by sheriff's deputies.

   A 2-year-old boy died today of a shrapnel
wound to the head from a car bomb that ripped through the national
headquarters of the paramilitary Civil Guard, officials said. He was
the second fatality.
   The explosives-packed van was detonated just before midnight
Tuesday. It instantly killed a 38-year-old Madrid man who was
driving nearby and injured 44 people, nine critically, police said.
   Nine of the 141 Civil Guards living in the headquarters were
slightly injured, police and hospital officials said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Interior
Ministry spokesmen said today that the attack bore the earmarks of
ETA, the Basque separatist organization.
   Luis Delgado Villalonga, 2, died this morning after eight hours
of treatment, said a spokesman for Clinico Hospital. The child was
hit by shrapnel while he was riding in a car with his parents, who
remained in critical condition with severe head injuries,
authorities said.
   Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera told reporters the bombers
parked an explosives-packed van on the sidewalk next to the
building, then ran to a stolen getaway car and apparently triggered
the blast seconds later by remote control. Police located the stolen
getaway car about two hours later, and exploded it as a precaution.
   The explosion tore a hole 15 feet in diameter through one wall of
the three-story headquarters, collapsing several ceilings. It
heavily damaged nearby buildings, including a convent and apartments
across from it, and shattered most windows within half a mile.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said the van was loaded with about
200 pounds of explosives and a large amoung of shrapnel and
destroyed more than 20 cars. It could be heard across the capital of
4 million residents.
   About the same time as Tuesday's explosion, suspected Basque
separatists set off three bombs in and near the northern Basque city
of Bilbao, seriously damaging three French car dealerships but
causing no injuries, police said.
   ETA has claimed at least 600 victims, many of them Civil Guards,
in its 20-year campaign to gain independence for the three-province
northern Spanish Basque country.
   So far this year, ETA has claimed responsibility for attacks
killing 14 people.
   ETA claimed responsibility for a similar car bomb attack on the
same Civil Guard building in May 1987 that killed a woman passerby.
   Last month, it offered to stop attacks for 60 days if the
government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez would begin discussions
in Algeria on the future of the Basque region.
   Gonzalez rejected the Nov. 2 offer, which came three days after
ETA released a hostage. The Basque group held the businessman for
248 days after his family paid an estimated $10 million ransom.

   Six Sikh gunmen killed 22 people and wounded
37 in a 20-minute shooting spree as they sped through this Hindu
town in a jeep during a blackout, witnesses and officials said.
   ``We were all taken by surprise. At first we thought it was a
motor scooter backfiring. Then we saw the terrorists. People were
falling down, and we ran,'' Rajesh Kumar said of the attack, which
occurred just after sundown Tuesday.
   Kumar, 23, runs a shop in Kaital's main bazaar.
   ``There was a noise like firecrackers. Suddenly people were
running,'' said 5-year-old Sumita, whose father, uncle and
8-year-old sister were killed. ``I saw my uncle falling after the
bullets hit him.''
   A bullet hit the girl in the left arm. Sumita, whose family does
not use a last name, said she heard her sister and father cry out
just before she lost consciousness.
   A power failure had blacked out the town shortly before the
attackers arrived, wrapped in blankets to hide their faces. The
cause of the failure was not immediately known.
   Kaital is in Haryana state and lies 12 miles south of the border
of Punjab state, where Sikh extremists have killed about 2,300
people this year in their bloody campaign for a separate nation.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attackers fled toward the Punjab border.
   The attack occurred on the eve of the birthday of Guru Nanak, a
15th century holy man revered as the founder of the Sikh faith.
   The gunmen fired automatic rifles into crowds in the bazaar
without stopping their jeep, Kumar and other witnesses said. They
said the attackers then fired indiscriminately at a crowd gathered
outside a shop selling homemade liquor and continued shooting as the
jeep roared past other market stalls.
   Doctors in Kaital said 20 people were killed instantly or died a
few hours later. Two more people died today in a Chandigarh
hospital, a doctor said.
   Kaital is in Haryana state's Kurukshetra district, where
suspected Sikh bombers killed 18 people last June.
   Police in Punjab and Haryana states, as well as in New Delhi,
which is 90 miles southeast of Kaital, were placed on alert after
Tuesday's attack.
   The violent Sikh campaign grew out of the extremists' call for a
separate homeland to preserve their culture and faith in a country
where they form just 2 percent of the population of 880 million.
   Sikhs are the majority in Punjab, a prosperous farming state.
   Their faith draws from both Hinduism and Islam, the major
religions in the area in Guru Nanak's time.

<DATELINE>SESPE CONDOR SANCTUARY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Andean condors are
napping and munching on beef and chopped rats as they await release
into the wild in an experiment aimed at saving their California
condor cousins from extinction.
   ``It will be a credit to humankind if we can preserve the animals
of the Earth, and the condor is but one animal facing dire
straits,'' said Jeff Opdycke, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
official who toured the Andean condor release site with reporters
Tuesday.
   Of thousands of California condors that once soared in the early
1800s, only 28 of the vulture-like, carrion-eating birds remain
alive. With 9-1@2-foot wingspans, they are North America's largest
bird.
   All the survivors are in captive breeding programs at the Los
Angeles Zoo and San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   In five to 10 years, after enough of them have produced offspring
in captivity, some of the young birds will be re-introduced into the
wild in another attempt to avoid extinction.
   To learn the best way to release the California condors and
assure their survival, researchers are using young Andean condors
donated by various zoos as stand-ins for their more endangered
relatives. One thousand to 2,000 Andean condors remain in the wilds
of South America.
   ``These are surrogates,'' said Joseph Dowhan, condor recovery
coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service. ``We're going to test
release techniques, release sites, and train people.''
   Seven of the Andean birds will be freed in December and January
into the 53,000-acre Sespe Condor Sanctuary, 50 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles.
   Along with up to 10 others to be freed late next year, they will
be rounded up when the $440,000 study is done in two or three years,
then released permanently in their native Colombia.
   About a dozen reporters were allowed to observe three of the
birds on Tuesday in a tour led by officials of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, the U.S. Forest Service, National Audubon Society, and Los
Angeles Zoo.
   The three young female condors, all about five months old and
weighing 19 to 21 pounds, sat in the shade, napping in the
net-enclosed half of their 35-by-16-foot roosting box, which sits
atop sawed-off telephone poles 10 feet above the ground to protect
them from black bears and coyotes.
   Biologists sneak into the cage at night to deliver meals of calf
meat, ground horse meat and chopped rats, said Mike Wallace, the Los
Angeles Zoo's curator of birds.
   The condors displayed Tuesday will be released in January, along
with a fourth bird that had not yet arrived.
   Scientists hope that once released, the birds will stay in the
sanctuary and away from areas where wild California condors died
from what officials believe was lead poisoning. They were poisoned
by eating the carcasses of coyotes that were trapped and shot, or
the remains of wounded deer that died after escaping hunters,
scientists said.
   Wallace said others probably were shot, and some may have been
killed by colliding with power lines.
   Development along California's coast and San Joaquin Valley also
gradually destroyed much condor habitat, researchers believe.
   So far, only one California condor chick has been hatched in
captivity. That is the seven-month-old Moloko, who resides at the
San Diego Wild Animal Park. Dowhan hopes one to five more chicks
will hatch next year.
   Four of the last five wild breeding pairs of California condors
vanished in 1984-1985. In 1986, the Fish and Wildlife Service made a
controversial decision to round up the last six wild birds to
prevent their demise.
   So far, attempts to save the condors have cost about $20 million.

<HEAD>Keith Hits Florida As Pacific Storm Drifts Toward the Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Keith blustered ashore in Florida today, spawning
tornadoes and bringing torrential rains, as a Pacific storm edged
toward the Rockies after hitting Oregon with 75 mph winds and
dumping nearly 4 inches of rain.
   In Florida, Keith's center made landfall shortly after 1 a.m.
today near Sarasota, about 50 miles south of Tampa. Later this
morning, the storm was moving east-northeast at 15-20 mph. It was
expected to move offshore in the Cape Canaveral area on the Atlantic
Coast.
   The storm was expected to dump up to 5 inches of rain and bring
tides 4 to 6 feet above normal. Early this morning, almost 2{ inches
were recorded at Tampa; more than 1{ inches at Daytona Beach, and
more than 1 inch at Gainesville.
   But a cold front from the North was mingling with Keith in the
Gulf of Mexico and was expected to sap its strength.
   At least two tornadoes were spotted near St. Petersburg early
today, but there were no immediate reports of injury or damage,
authorities said.
   In Lake County, a tornado struck a mobile home park south of
Leesburg, then skipped across a field and hit another park Tuesday
morning, officials said.
   If Keith's winds reach over 74 mph, it would become the sixth
hurricane of the Atlantic storm season, which runs from June through
Nov. 30. Keith is the 11th named storm of the season.
   In the Pacific Northwest, snow began to fall Tuesday night in
Oregon's higher elevations, with up to 2 feet in mountain passes
expected by today.
   The Pacific storm, moving toward the Rockies, also knocked down
power lines with winds up to 75 mph in Clackamas County southeast of
Portland, Ore., and unleashed nearly 4 inches of rain in less than
24 hours Tuesday.
   Today's forecast called for rain and thunderstorms from Florida
through the Carolinas; rain through the northern Pacific coastal
areas to Nevada and the Rockies, with rain turning to snow in higher
elevations; and strong, gusty winds from the northern and central
Pacific Coast to the Rockies.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 30s and 40s from New
England to the northern Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the upper
Mississippi Valley, North Dakota, the upper Missouri Valley, the
northern Rockies, the northern half of the Pacific Coast; the 70s
from the desert Southwest to southern Texas; near 70 over northern
Florida to the low and mid-80s across southern Florida; and in the
50s and 60s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 17
degrees at Montpelier, Vt., to 81 at Homestead, Fla.

   People were tied up in knots over Silly
String until the City Council banned its sale and use.
   But since that action Monday, police face the sticky question of
enforcing the prohibition against the plastic shot from a can.
   ``We have the discretion to enforce the law and we will use it,''
acting Police Chief Joseph Barry said Tuesday. ``We're not going to
go up to people and say, `This is a Silly String raid.'''
   Silly String became a problem at this year's Labor Day parade
when vendors sold it to young spectators.
   ``Every kid had a can of the stuff,'' Barry said. They sprayed
passing cars, pedestrians, fire trucks and anything else they could
think of, he said.
   ``The Department of Public Works had a horrendous time cleaning
it up,'' he said.
   Violators of the ban face a fine as high as $200.
   Many Marlboro stores stopped selling Silly String after Halloween.
   ``I have to wrestle with my conscience every time I sell it,''
said one vendor, who asked not to be identified. ``It's horrible.''
   Nathan Rossi, 15, disagreed. ``The stuff is awesome!'' he said.
   ``You sit there and spray people when they go by, '' said Rae
Campbell, 15. ``It's great.''

<HEAD>Government Bars Distribution Of Harper's Over Intelligence Excerpts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has barred distribution of the
December issue of Harper's magazine because it contains sensitive
excerpts from a book by former intelligence agent Anthony Cavendish,
the distributors said today.
   The government warned the distributors, COMAG, that issue of the
U.S.-published magazine would breach a High Court order barring two
London newspapers from publishing material about Cavendish's work in
East bloc countries in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
   ``At this time, we have agreed not to distribute'' the December
issue, a spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity.
   Cavendish, a 61-year-old merchant banker, worked for Britain's
MI6 agency, which gathers foreign intelligence.
   He abandoned a two-year battle to publish his memoirs, ``Inside
Intelligence,'' after the government threatened legal action, but he
sent 500 privately printed copies to friends as Christmas presents
last year.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government obtained an interim
injunction Jan. 2 against The Observer and The Sunday Times
newspapers after arguing that Cavendish broke a formal vow never to
reveal details of his intelligence work and that publication would
damage national security.
   Cavendish wrote that Harold Wilson may have abruptly resigned as
Labor Party prime minister in March 1976 because the Soviet KGB had
acquired embarrassing information about him.
   Wilson stepped down less than midway through his government's
normal five-year term of office. The 72-year-old politician, now
Lord Wilson, was twice prime minister, from 1964 to 1970 and from
1974 to 1976.

   A man accused of helping Nazis exterminate
more than 20,000 Jews in Lithuania during World War II was stripped
of U.S. citizenship but will not be deported, the Justice Department
says.
   Juoza Kungys, 73, of Clifton in northern New Jersey will be
allowed to remain in the United States as a permanent resident alien
as part of an agreement in which he admitted to authorities that he
lied to U.S. officials when he entered the country after World War
II, the department said.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise signed the consent
order here last week, and the Justice Department made it public
Tuesday.
   Government lawyers have said that in 1941, Kungys, as a member of
a military organization known as the Sauliai, helped force more than
2,000 Jewish men, women and children to undress and enter a ditch,
where they were shot.
   The government permitted Kungys to stay because he would probably
have been allowed to remain due to future litigation, said Neal
Sher, director of the Justice Department's special investigations
office. Sher said Kungys would still be eligible for extradition to
stand trial abroad.
   The Justice Department moved to revoke Kungys citizenship in
1981. Throughout the case, left unresolved by the Supreme Court last
May, authorities have charged that Kungys lied about his place of
birth and residence during the war.

2,000 Jewish men, women and children to undress and enter a ditch,

   Kungys entered the U.S. in 1948 an was granted citizenship in
1954.

<TEXT>
   College students rolled 10-pound frozen
butterballs at plastic pins in a holiday tournament that gave new
meaning to the term bowling a turkey.
   More than 50 students at Kearney State College participated
Monday night in the bowling championship in a dormitory hallway.
Sponsors said foul fowls were more common than turkeys, a real
bowling term for three strikes in a row.
   ``There are no holes in the turkey to put your fingers,'' said
Melissa Fitch, a sophomore. Miss Fitch said she averages 150 on a
real bowling alley but managed to knock down only 16 pins in the
turkey competition.
   ``I think its hilarious,'' she said. ``I've never seen anything
like it.''
   The rules and scoring during the 52-person tourney established by
the dormitory's resident assistants were generally the same as those
used in real bowling.
   ``Turkey must stay within taped boundaries or it is considered a
gutter turkey,'' one sign said. The cry of ``gutter turkey'' was
heard throughout the night.
   Some bowlers grasped the turkey by the net cover or the plastic
handle to propel the bird toward the toy pins. Others used two hands
to push it down the lane. Gina Christensen, a freshman, hiked her
``ball'' football-style.
   Tom Upthagrove, a freshman, said students needed a break from
their studies.
   ``It gives us something to talk about. It cheers us up,'' he said.
   Resident assistant Brad Krutsinger said winners of the finals
scheduled later this week will have the option of keeping a turkey
as a prize.
   But he said the birds may be mangled by then and probably will be
donated to the local Humane Society for use as cat food.

   Guerrillas fired a rocket at two
police jeeps, but missed and demolished a butcher's shop, police
reported.
   A press officer at Belfast police headquarters said the
Soviet-made RPG7 anti-tank rocket just missed a crowded pub when it
was fired Tuesday night in Castlewellan, 25 miles south of Belfast.
No one was injured.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but
suspicion fell on the Irish Republican Army. The mainly Roman
Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in predominantly
Protestant Northern Ireland and unite it with the 95 percent
Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   The press officer said on condition of anonymity that the rocket
went through the window of the shop and through two walls at the
back of the building before exploding.
   He said a man who had just left the pub narrowly escaped death
when the rocket passed within a few feet of him. The man's parked
car was damaged in the explosion.
   ``It is a miracle he is alive today,'' Chief Superintendent Alwyn
Harris of the Royal Ulster Constabulary said today. Harris said the
rocket is ``a notoriously indiscrimate and inaccurate weapon'' and
if it had hit the pub, ``we could easily have had a massacre on our
hands.''
   The press officer said the rocket was fired from a house taken
over by two masked men who held three people in the building at
gunpoint while they waited for the police patrol to pass by.
   He said that after the attack, the gunmen fled in a car owned by
the house's owner. The car was later found abandoned.
   The officer said police believe the rocket was supplied to the
IRA by Libya. British authorities have repeatedly alleged that
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has been supplying the IRA with
arms.

   A man who trained his video camera on his
parrot to catch the bird talking while he was away instead caught
two teen-agers who burglarized his home and threatened to throttle
the squawking animal.
   Roy Ohse, 57, rigged the camera before he went to the store in
May and returned a half-hour later and turned on the videotape.
   ``Was I surprised,'' he recalled Monday.
   He didn't know he had been burglarized until he heard human
voices on the tape. The burglars could be heard rummaging through
things.
   One voice said, ``See anything worth taking?'' Another said,
``You take the bag and stuff and I'll take this.''
   Both burglars passed in front of the camera and their faces could
be clearly seen. At one point, a 13-year-old said to his older
accomplice, ``There's a video camera, you want to chance it with
that?''
   ``Nah,'' came the answer from the background.
   One teen-ager threatened to throttle the bird, which by this time
was squawking loudly. One even pulled a gun.
   ``Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,'' the other boy said.
``It'll be too noisy and too bloody.''
   ``I'm going to strangle you, you (expletive) bird,'' the first
teen-ager said.
   ``Well, strangle it. Just don't shoot it.''
   The two left without harming the bird, called Turkey by its owner.
   When Ohse played the tape for police and family, a friend of his
son recognized one of the teen-agers. The two teen-agers later
pleaded guilty to burglary and a third pleaded guilty to dealing in
stolen property.

   Dynamite hidden in a lamppost exploded as
the defense minister was leaving his office, killing three
bodyguards and wounding two but leaving the minister unhurt,
authorities said.
   Callers saying they were urban communist rebels claimed
responsibility for Tuesday night's attempt to kill Gen. Manuel Jaime
Guerrero Paz, who was appointed defense minister just two weeks ago.
   Surrounded by bodyguards, Guerrero Paz was leaving the Defense
Ministry at 8:15 p.m. EST when the 20-pound charge was detonated by
remote control, police said. The blast destroyed a Toyota van and
sent three bodyguards and their motorcycles into the air, they said.
   The armor-plated Lancia automobile in which Guerrero Paz was
riding was not damaged, and its driver immediately drove it into the
building's courtyard, the ministry's press office said.
   The explosion opened a hole in the pavement and blew out windows
of homes across the street from the Defense Ministry.
   Three enlisted men who were guarding the minister were killed,
and two others were hurt but out of danger in a police hospital, the
press office said.
   People claiming to represent an arm of the communist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group called radio
stations and claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt.
   Guerrero Paz was named defense minister after President Virgilio
Barco forced the resignation of his predecessor, Gen. Rafael Zamudio
Molina, for ordering all-out war against leftist guerrillas.
   The rebels have launched a recent campaign of terrorist attacks
and sabotage that political analysts say have thrown the country
into chaos.
   Guerrero Paz promised last week to maintain the course advocated
by Barco, who seeks a negotiated political solution with leftist
guerrillas.

<HEAD>Posters Of Missing Girl Banned from Shopping Malls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Posters bearing the photo of a 9-year-old
kidnapping victim have been ordered removed from common areas at two
shopping malls by managers who cited policies against non-profit
displays.
   Managers of Hayward's Southland Shopping Center and Newark's
NewPark mall on Tuesday also told volunteers in the search for
Michaela Garecht not to pass out fliers on mall grounds.
   Michaela Garecht's grandmother, Audrey Nemeth, who works at a
department store at Southland, said the mall should make an
exception.
   ``I think it's pretty disgusting,'' she said. ``I understand the
issue of clutter, but a missing child is a lot different.''
   Michaela was last seen Saturday, when a man forced her into his
car in Hayward, authorities said.
   Southland Mall manager Elliott Riley said he told the mall's
security guards to remove the fliers, which he said were placed in a
haphazard fashion, in violation of the mall's rules and without the
consent of mall management.
   Riley said later he would work out a plan to post the fliers in
the mall if the people distributing them contact him. He said he
also would pay for an ad.
   Some stores refused to remove the flier from their windows.
   Jim Elliott, security manager for J.C. Penney Co., said a mall
security guard who asked that the flier be removed was told it would
stay up. No effort was made to remove it, Elliott said.
   At NewPark and Southland, merchants were allowed to display
posters inside the stores but could not put them in the windows
facing the shopping center.
   ``We have a policy that we cannot attach anything to the common
areas,'' said NewPark Mall marketing director Lisa Shepherd. ``A
store can do whatever they wish within their store area.''
   Bay Fair Mall in San Leandro was plastered with fliers also.
Manager Paul DeMarco said the posters will stay although they
violate mall rules.
   ``This is a local girl,'' he said. ``The chance is good that
someone might see her.''

   An oxygen-eating gas designed to put out
fires accidentally discharged in the City-County Building, and eight
police and fire dispatchers were overcome, authorities said.
   The dispatchers were given oxygen Tuesday night and none required
hospital treatment.
   Fire Capt. Gary Campbell said a malfunction system caused the
building fire alarm to go off and the gas Halon to be released.
Dispatchers were forced to crawl out because there was more oxygen
near the floor, Campbell said.
   Firefighters used fans to blow the gas from the rooms, and
dispatchers returned after about an hour. Communications were not
disrupted because dispatchers who were not affected used hand-held
radios to monitor calls.

<HEAD>Mild Quake Shakes Southern Quebec</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A mild earthquake shook southern Quebec early
today, causing slight damage but no injuries, officials said.
   The epicenter of the quake, which measured 4.9 on the Richter
scale, was 90 miles north of Quebec City, John Adams of the
Geological Survey of Canada said. Preliminary measurements by the
U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., put the magnitude of the
quake at 4.5 on the Richter scale.
   The 4:11 a.m. jolt was felt in Quebec City and over a broad area
including Bagotville, Trois-Rivieres, Chicoutimi and Lac St-Jean,
Adams said.
   ``Some unconfirmed damage has been reported in Lac St-Jean,''
Adams said. ``But it would be slight _ in the nature of cracks
showing in walls, glasses or china falling off shelves, that sort of
thing.''
   There were some reports of people thinking a snowblower had been
turned on outside their home or their furnace had blown up. But most
residents between Quebec City and Chicoutimi slept through the
unexpected quake.
   Earthquakes are very rare in the region, which is considered
relatively stable, Adams said. ``This one really caught us by
surprise,'' he said.
   The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage.

<HEAD>American MIA Hunters Float Messages on River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans searching for U.S. prisoners
of war in communist Laos today had several hundred Thai children
float tiny foam boats with messages across the Mekong River to Laos,
a spokesman said.
   Dr. Amos Townsend, a member of the group, said unfavorable winds
made it unlikely many of the 600 small craft would reach the Laotian
bank, but he said the ``message would get across.'' The Mekong River
divides Thailand and Laos.
   Each boat, six inches in diameter, carried a written note that
read: ``This boat represents one of about 600 Americans who are
still unaccounted for in Laos. May this effort appease the spirits
of those who have died and help bring back to their families those
who are still living.''
   The U.S. State Department lists 547 Americans as missing in Laos
from the Indochina war.
   Townsend said in a telephone interview the group was hoping to
publicize a $2.4-million reward for the return of any live American
POW in Indochina. But he said the boats did not carry information
about the monetary reward.
   The launch coincided with the ancient Thai ``Loy Krathong''
festival. Celebrated on the full moon each November, Thais set
banana leaf boats on bodies of water and offer prayers to the water
spirits.
   Townsend and three other Americans are based in the northeastern
province of Nakhon Phanom bordering Laos where the craft were
launched and where they hope to establish a ``long-term presence''
and gather information on Americans they believe are still being
held.
   Two other Americans were recently imprisoned for 41 days after
entering Laos illegally to advertise the same reward, which has been
offered by several U.S. congressmen and private individuals.
   Donna Long and James Copp, both from North Carolina, were freed
after a U.S. veterans group paid $1,500 and canceled a protest
planned near the Laotian Embassy in Washington to demand their
release.
   Laos has repeatedly denied it holds any Americans. The recent
foray by the two Americans prompted criticism from the U.S. State
Department, which wants to resolve the issue of missing Americans
through official contacts with the Laotian government.
   More than 2,380 Americans are still listed as missing in action,
or MIA, in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia from the Indochina war, which
ended in 1975 with communist victories in those countries.
   In recent months, cooperation has increased between the United
States and the governments of Laos and Vietnam in an effort to
resolve the issue.

<HEAD>Photographer Home After 20-Month Ordeal That Began With Spanish
Drug Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNANDALE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Photographer Conan Owen is home with his
parents today, savoring his freedom after a 20-month ordeal that
began with his arrest in Spain for a drug trafficking crime U.S.
officials said he didn't commit.
   Owen, 24, arrived home Tuesday night, his parents' 27th wedding
anniversary, to a jubilant welcome and said his first order of
business was to ``sleep in'' and then spend today talking on the
phone to friends.
   Federal prison officials in Pennsylvania on Tuesday released Owen
for a holiday furlough. Under a plan approved by a federal parole
commission, Owen will be able to serve remaining months of his
sentence at home with his parents Ernest and Raquel Owens.
   On Monday, Owen will report to the Fairfax County Home Detention
Program in Fairfax to be fitted with an electronic device that will
monitor him during his period of house arrest.
   Owen, a 1986 honors graduate of Syracuse University, was
sentenced last April to six years in prison by a Spanish court for
carrying four pounds of 80 percent pure cocaine in a suitcase to an
airport in Barcelona in March 1987.
   U.S. investigators later collected evidence that he had been
duped into becoming a drug courier without his knowledge, and
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III pleaded Owen's case with
Spanish authorities.
   Owen's former boss, George Barahona, confessed in a U.S. court
that he and colleagues had hidden the cocaine in the suitcase which
they asked Owen to carry to Barcelona. Spanish officials refused to
admit Barahona's deposition as evidence.
   Owen was transferred to New York on Nov. 8 under terms of a 1983
treaty that provides for the transfer of prisoners between the
United States and Spain when a citizen of one country is convicted
of a crime in another.
   Owen worked as a 1984 summer intern in Vice President George
Bush's office and had been admitted to the U.S. Army Intelligence
School in Fort Huachuca, Ariz.
   Owen was furloughed after a hearing Tuesday at the federal
Correctional Institution in Loretto, Pa., where he has been
incarcerated since his return to the United States.
   The U.S. Parole Commission said Tuesday that Owen's role in
bringing cocaine into Spain was ``peripheral'' _ a courier with ``no
managerial or proprietary interest'' _ and reduced his minimum
prison sentence from 40 months to 24 months. A parole hearing is
scheduled for March 12.

   A national guardsman fired wildly into a
parade at his barracks today, killing four guardsmen and injuring at
least 12 before committing suicide, officials and news reports said.
   Gen. Lemos Couto, commander of Ajuda barracks of the Portuguese
National Republican Guardsmen, said the shots were fired into a
troop of cadets by a Cpl. Antonio Saraiva Antunes. Couto said
Antunes, 28, fired his own hunting rifle, rather than a military
weapon.
   Following the attack Antunes shot himself with a pistol and died
later in Lisbon's Sao Fransisco Xavier hospital, Couto said.
   ``(The corporal) went mad and fired indiscriminately with what
seemed to be his own hunting rifle into the guards from the terrace
above the parade ground,'' Couto said.
   A barracks official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
some cadets shot back at Antunes. Two of the four guards who died
were officers. One officer killed was Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge
Duarte de Almeida, the barracks second-in-command, said the
official. Antunes' death left 12 guardsmen hospitalized, including
one in critical condition, doctors said.
   Antunes, who received a commendation from his division commander
in 1987, was apparently popular with his colleagues and had no
record of disciplinary measures or mental illness, Portuguese media
reports said.
   He joined the National Guard in 1982.

   A man stalking what he thought was an
intruder accidentally shot and killed his sister, who was
unexpectedly home from school with a sore throat, the deputy coroner
ruled.
   Harold Leon Wasson, 19, apparently killed 13-year-old Christine
Lynn Wasson with a shot to the head from a rifle Tuesday,
authorities said.
   Wasson told detectives that after returning home, he heard noises
in the house, said Lt. Mike Ennis, spokesman for the Sheriff's
Department. Loading a .357-caliber rifle, ``he started working his
way back through the house,'' Ennis said.
   ``He said that when he opened (his sister's) door, it wouldn't
open all the way. About that time, she stepped from behind the door,
and he fired,'' Ennis said.
   Spartanburg County Deputy Coroner Richard Seay ruled the shooting
accidental.
   Investigators don't know whether Christine yelled or jumped
toward her brother, but she apparently ``intended to scare him or
play a joke on him,'' Ennis said.
   No charges have been filed against Wasson. Ennis said ``there are
a lot of questions right now that still aren't answered.''

<HEAD>Trotsky's Son Posthumously Rehabilitated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Supreme Court has rehabilitated Leon
Trotsky's son, Sergei Sedov, who was killed in Josef Stalin's purges
even though he rejected his father's beliefs.
   The court's action came after Sedov's daughter, Yulia Akselrod,
who immigrated to the United States in 1979, wrote President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev seeking to clear her father's name.
   The government newspaper Izvestia reported Monday that ``charges
are dropped'' against Sedov, who it said was shot to death in 1937.
   The terse, two-sentence reference to Sedov partially answered
Mrs. Akselrod's questions about the circumstances of her father's
death. She said in September that she did not know when or how her
father died.
   Izvestia said Sedov was sentenced in 1935, but was killed two
years later.
   Trotsky, once a leader of the revolution, was expelled from the
Soviet Union by Stalin in 1929 after losing a power struggle
following the death of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin in 1924.
   Stalin advocated ``communism in one country,'' while Trotsky
believed in worldwide revolution. Later, in the purges of the 1930s
Stalin hunted down real and imagined followers of Trotsky and had
them imprisoned or killed.
   Mrs. Akselrod said she and her family were still being punished
for their lineage. She said her father had been politically and
personally estranged from Trotsky.
   Until Gorbachev mentioned Trotsky in a speech last year, his name
had been taboo.
   Mrs. Akselrod said the Soviet government should fully clear
Trotsky's name and document his true role in the revolution.
   But despite Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or more openness on
some issues, officials have so far taken the stance that Trotsky's
views were wrong and his full rehabilitation soon is unlikely.
   After being branded a traitor, Trotsky left the country with his
wife, Natalia Sedova, and their oldest son Lyova, who avidly backed
his father. He was assassinated in Mexico in 1940, allegedly by a
Mexican Communist Party member loyal to Stalin.
   Sedov, who stayed behind in the Soviet Union, took his mother's
name to avoid persecution and thought he was safe. Mrs. Akselrod
said her father was sent to Siberia about three months before she
was born.

   A Quaker organization is seeking a religious
exemption from a law requiring employers to fire undocumented aliens.
   Provisions in the 1986 immigration reform act ``require us to act
in ways that violate our fundamental religious beliefs,'' said
Stephen G. Cary, chairman of the board of directors of the American
Friends Service Committee.
   The lawsuit filed in federal court Tuesday seeks to exempt the
Quakers from the threat of fines of up to $10,000 against employers
who fail to verify documents or fail to fire employees who don't
produce documentation.
   The Quakers, who employ 450 people, have disobeyed the
documentation provision while deciding on a legal course, Cary said.
   ``We find ourselves ordered by the government to cast out those
we have tried for so long to help,'' he said. ``The effort of a
parent to feed his or her children is criminalized. The demand that
we fire those we cannot document is repugnant to us.''
   A spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
declined to comment on the lawsuit.

<HEAD>Politburo Member Sees No Obstacles To Multiparty System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Politburo said today he
saw no obstacle in principle to the formation of opposition
political parties now that movement toward more pluralism has become
``unstoppable.''
   Imre Pozsgay, who is also minister of state in the Communist
government, spoke hours before the policy-setting party Central
Committee was to name a new premier to succeed party leader Karoly
Grosz. Parliament still has to approve the candidate when it meets
in session Thursday.
   The new premier will face a difficult task over the next two
years, presiding over extensive economic and political reforms.
   Before elections in 1990, when a new constitution is due to be
adopted, Parliament is to pass a series of laws designed to
introduce market forces into the economy and to restructure
political institutions. This may pave the way for a multiparty
system.
   Pozsgay, a leading reformer brought to the Politburo when Grosz
took over as party leader in May, told a news conference today, ``I
personally see no obstacles in principle to the existence of a
multiparty system.''
   ``There has developed a genuine need (for pluralism), also a
movement on the part of society itself that is unstoppable,'' he
said.
   ``It would destabilize the country and lead to a potential
catastrophe if (the leadership) tried to stall this effort,'' he
said.
   In December, Parliament is due to adopt legislation regulating
the establishment of independent groups, associations and unions.
The new laws accept a multiparty system in principle. However,
government leaders say further legislation is necessary to determine
the establishment and function of parties. Those laws are not
expected before 1990.
   Dozens of independent groups and movements have sprung up over
the past year, many with highly political platforms. Until last
week, however, none had gone so far as to declare themselves a party.
   On Friday, the independent Smallholders' Party, which headed a
coalition government before the Communists assumed power in 1948,
announced that it was resuming its activites. Hungarian news media
gave no publicity to the move, in sharp contrast with its new policy
of openness.
   Pozsgay said the government would not exert repressive measures
against the new party. But he added that until the legal framework
for the establishment of parties has been created, the government
would not provide publicity for it.
   Pozsgay is to present to Parliament what he called the
government's ``package plan for democracy,'' a report on reforming
the system of political institutions.
   ``The model of socialism as applied until now was not
effective,'' Pozsgay said. It was ``an impediment to social progress
and economic growth.'' Hungary must find a way to become a
``Socialist country with pluralism,'' he said.
   Reform legislation now being considered includes the laws on
assembly and association to be passed in December and laws on press
freedom, the right to strike and electoral reform, he said.
   Pozsgay said Hungary's 10.6 million citizens should be given a
direct voice in decision making, possibly through referendum. The
powers of the judiciary also should be strengthened by establishing
constitutional courts, he said.

<HEAD>Judge To Hold Closed Hearings On Whether To Delete Some Sensitive
Items</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 4 grafs on White House role.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case will hold
closed hearings on Oliver L. North's objections to deleting
sensitive references from secret documents that prosecutors want to
use as evidence against him.
   North, a former White House aide, is charged with conspiring to
illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan
anti-government Contra rebels.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on Tuesday ordered closed
hearings to begin Nov. 30 and continue ``thereafter day-to-day as
long as necessary'' to review the deletions from 350 classified
documents proposed by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   Walsh wants to delete the names of countries, foreign officials
and U.S. agents stationed abroad to protect secret diplomatic and
intelligence initiatives.
   The government has agreed to allow Walsh to use the documents as
evidence in a public trial provided the sensitive information is
deleted.
   The judge said North ``should be prepared to explain why a
proposed redaction (deletion) is relevant and material for his
defense.''
   Gesell made no mention in his brief order of North's proposal to
introduce into evidence 40,000 pages of classified material. At a
hearing on Monday, the judge seemed to indicate he would grant
Walsh's motion to bar North from using any of the material, saying
he had no intention of scheduling hearings on North's proposals.
   The independent prosecutor argued in court papers that North's
list of documents should be rejected as legally insufficient.
   He contended that the former National Security Council aide
listed many of the documents simply to frighten the government to
drop the charges to prevent disclosing some of the nation's most
well-kept intelligence and foreign-policy secrets.
   In his order scheduling the hearings on the prosecution's
documents, Gesell said he had reviewed many of the papers.
   ``Numerous redactions appear designed to excise the identity of
countries mentioned and communications with named individuals,
including officials of such countries and United States agents in
the field,'' the judge said.
   ``Almost without exception North objects to these categories of
redactions.''
   The prosecution exhibits include between 1,000 and 2,000 pages of
classified material.
   The Classified Information Procedures Act provides for
substitution of information with a written statement of facts if
North convinces the judge that some of the material Walsh wants to
delete from the exhibits is necessary for his defense.
   Gesell directed Walsh to devise an alternative system to denoting
countries and officials with numbers and letters, saying ``this
masking technique appears unduly cumbersome and likely to prevent
easy reading of the text.''
   No date has been set for North's trial. Separate trials have been
ordered for former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and
arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord.
   Marlin Fitzwater, President Reagan's spokesman, said Tuesday the
White House role currently is ``to review classified information
that has been designated by the prosecution and by the defense'' for
possible use in the trial.
   Asked to comment on suggestions by Gesell that Reagan should
consider exercising his constitutional authority to thwart North's
trial if the president feels national security would be compromised,
Fitzwater replied, ``We don't have any direct role.''
   Reagan for months has said he would not discuss with reporters
the option of granting a pardon to North. On Monday, when asked
whether he was drawing near a decision on a possible pardon, he
replied, ``No, no. And I don't think it would be any time to make
such a decision while it's still before the courts.''
   When pressed during a news briefing to say whether a pardon was
being considered, Fitzwater said repeatedly, ``We aren't discussing
pardons.''

   President Reagan believes the
criminal justice system should resolve whether former aide Oliver
North violated the law in the Iran-Contra affair, and he has no
intention of trying to stop North's trial, Reagan's spokesman says.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in statements that seemed to rule out
a presidential pardon in advance of North's trial, said Tuesday the
White House role currently is merely ``to review classified

would be compromised, Fitzwater replied, ``We don't have any direct
role.''
   Reagan for months has said he would not discuss with reporters
the option of granting a pardon to North, and has said it would be
inappropriate to comment while the legal process was under way.
   On Monday, when asked whether he was drawing near a decision on a
possible pardon, the president said much the same thing. ``No, no,''
he replied. ``And I don't think it ould be any time to make such a
decision while it's still before the courts.''
   But when pressed during a White House news briefing to say
whether a pardon was being considered, Fitzwater said repeatedly,
``We aren't discussing pardons.''
   Fitzwater reiterated that ``on previous occasions'' the White
House has said that Reagan's position was that ``he believes the
legal process should be allowed to take its course.''
   Reagan often has sought to minimize the impact of the worst
foreign policy scandal to beset his administration _ the brouhaha
resulting from the clandestine sale of U.S. arms to Iran and the
subsequent diversion of proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels fighting the
Sandinista regime in Managua.
   North is charged with conspiring to defraud the government in
connection with these transactions, which resulted at least in part
from attempts by the administration in 1985 and 1986 to win the
release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian groups.
   Gesell on Tuesday ordered closed hearings to begin Nov. 30 on
North's objections to deleting sensitive references from secret
documents that prosecutors want to use as evidence against him.
   The hearings, Gesell said, will continue as long as necessary to
review the deletions from 350 classified documents proposed by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Wals.
   Walsh wants to delete the names of countries, foreign officials
and U.S. agents stationed abroad to protect secrets diplomatic and
intelligence initiatives.
   Gesell had said Monday that if North's trial proceeded as
scheduled, a large amount of sensitive information probably would be
revealed in this public setting. He said the court would likely
consider any request by the president on the witholding of certain
documents and evidence.
   Fitzwater said the administration, so far, has not sought to
invoke executive privilege to protect such information. He also said
that ``we have declassified or reviewed _ and declined to
declassify'' some 40,000 pages of documents that have been provided
by both sides in the case.
   Reagan has shown little inclination to grant a pardon, and he has
less than 60 days in office. The president last March said he still
thought that North, his former National Security Council staff
deputy, ``is a hero.''
   He said he did not think that either North or former national
security council adviser John Poindexter would be convicted, saying,
``I just have to believe that they're going to be found innocent
because I don't think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or any
crime.''
   Then-chief of staff Howard Baker subsequently told reporters that
a pre-trial or pre-verdict pardon for North was ``highly unlikely.''
   Such a decision could end up in the hands of President-elect
George Bush.
   During a Dec. 5, 1987 interview with British broadcast
personality David Frost, Bush said he believed that history would
judge North as a hero because the Marine lieutenant colonel
``believed passionately in something.''
   ``Ollie stood up there, took the heat, and the American people in
every bar in Chicago and every bowling alley in Texas and every
little home said, `Hey, this guy believes in something, and I can
identify with it.'''

<HEAD>Man Who Confessed to 50 Acts of Arson Charged in Landmark Church's
Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who confessed to setting more than 50
fires to get back at people who had made him unhappy has been
charged in the blaze that badly damaged a landmark, 125-year-old
church 4{ years ago.
   Philip Melanson, 30, of Orlando, Fla., a former Concord resident,
was charged with the fire at St. Paul's Episcopal Church and six
other blazes in Concord in 1983 and 1984, Merrimack County Attorney
Michael Johnson said Tuesday.
   Melanson was arrested in Orlando in March and convicted of
setting three fires there. He confessed to starting 53 others there,
said Tony Coschignano, an Orlando arson investigator. The fires
caused an estimated $3 million damage, he said.
   Melanson, a dishwasher at a restaurant, told the Orlando Sentinel
the fires were his way of getting back at those who had ridiculed
and abused him.
   ``I'd walk by a place, I'd see faces laughing at me,'' Melanson
said in a jailhouse interview. ``My stepfather, my mother, basically
anybody who had hurt me. I'd see the faces every time I'd walk by,
going to work, coming home. I'd see it about a week. It was enough
to irritate me. So I'd light it, to get the face away.''
   ``It felt good, seeing the flames. Power, I guess. All my life,
people were beating on me and I had to pay them back. This is how I
paid them back,'' Melanson said.
   He was sentenced Oct. 28 to nine years in prison.
   Johnson said he expects no problems extraditing Melanson on the
New Hampshire charges, three of which carry prison terms of 7{ to 15
years.
   Within a week of the 1984 fire at St. Paul's, police arrested
Melanson on charges of making a harassing call to the Fire
Department days after the fire. The caller told a dispatcher: ``This
is the arson man. I'm down in the South End and I'm going to burn.''
   The call was traced to Melanson's apartment. Police questioned
Melanson about the fire and others but said they had no evidence to
bring charges. Trial on the harassment charge was postponed several
times and never took place because Melanson disappeared.
   The Orlando fires were set after dark, mostly in vacant apartment
houses or stores closed for the night. Twice Melanson set fires in
buildings where people were living, but no one was injured.
   He was caught in March after setting fire to a vacant house in
Orlando. A neighbor spotted him walking back and forth in the
shadows and called police.
   ``He wanted to be caught,'' said Kelly Sims, his Florida public
defender. ``In this last one, he just stayed.''
   It took 2{ years and $3 million to repair the damage from the St.
Paul's fire, which left only the walls, bell tower and about half
the roof intact.
   Firefighters had to smash a century-old stained glass window to
ventilate the building, and the floor under the altar collapsed.

   Former President Chun Doo-hwan, saying
he's ashamed of human rights abuses and corruption during his rule,
told the nation today he is surrendering $24 million and going into
internal exile.
   But opposition leaders demanded a thorough investigation into
corruption under Chun and said he must account for billions of
dollars they contend was misappropriated. They doubted the apology
would be sufficient.
   ``I am pained and ashamed of my past. I have no intention at all
to make an excuse,'' Chun, looking tired and strained, said in a
nationally televised 30-minute address.
   ``I have to bear full responsibility for the past seven years,
which is branded by the people as an era of authoritarianism and
misdeeds, although I tried to do my best in my way,'' Chun said.
   ``My dear people, I am really sorry,'' said the former general
who took power with military backing in 1980.
   He made a special apology for the military suppression of a 1980
uprising by students and citizens in the southern city of Kwangju
that left about 200 people dead. He described the incident as a
``tragedy.''
   Chun said he was turning over his property to the government,
including his Seoul house, two golf club memberships and $3.3
million in cash. He also said he would return about $20 million in
political funds.
   Millions of Koreans watched the live midmorning broadcast. People
flocked around TV sets in shops and offices, and traffic was light
as people stayed home to see Chun's apology.
   Chuna and his wife, Lee Soon-ja, left their home after the speech
to go into exile at an undisclosed rural location in a traditional
gesture of apology. Mrs. Lee wept while her husband sat stone-faced
in the car that took them away.
   The couple spent the first day of exile in a remote Buddhist
temple in eastern South Korea. Newspapers said they would stay in a
nearby village for a while but would move occasionally for security
reasons. Radical groups have vowed to punish Chun.
   About 50 radical students armed with firebombs and steel rods
tried to rush Chun's home after the speech, but they were stopped by
some of the 5,000 riot police ringing the area. Chun had already
left.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan,'' protesters yelled as police dispersed
them.
   Radical students and dissidents called for daily protests to
demand Chun's arrest. Dissident groups said the apology was an empty
gesture and denounced President Roh Tae-woo for trying to protect
his predecessor.
   Seoul newspapers reported today that Roh plans to pardon Chun in
the next few days and reshuffle the government to remove supporters
of the former president. Officials declined comment.
   Roh, another former general and close ally of Chun, is trying to
defuse mounting public anger against the former president without
damaging himself and the government he took over from Chun. Some
opposition groups are calling for Roh's removal, contending he is a
front for military rule.
   Many observers doubt Chun's apology will defuse the crisis and
Roh is expected to face more problems in coming weeks. Roh took
office as Chun's seven-year term ended in February. He had won a
presidential election by a plurality but not a majority, as the
opposition vote was split by two candidates, Kim Dae-jung and Kim
Young-sam.
   Chun asked for forgiveness, but said he was ready to accept the
peoples' judgment. He asked the nation to allow him to stay in South
Korea, indicating he did not want to be exiled overseas.
   ``I deeply repent my sins. ... I'm ready to face any sufferings
and will not shirk responsibility for the results of my deeds,'' he
said.
   Chun has denied any personal corruption, but some of his
relatives and associates have been convicted or charged with
embezzlement and other crimes.
   He apologized for the forced dismissal of government officials
and journalists when he took power, the deaths of opposition
supporters who were sent to harsh re-education camps, and corruption
and embezzlement by some of his relatives and associates.
   Kim Dae-jung told reporters opposition leaders would call for
appointment of a special prosecutor to expose corruption under the
Chun government.
   He said Chun's apology was ``personally sincere,'' but did not go
far enough. He charged that billions of dollars were misappropriated
under Chun and called for a full accounting.
   Chun said in his apology that he had overseen collection of
political funds, but was turning over all money under his control to
the government. He said the opposition would not believe that he did
not have any more money.
   Kim Young-sam said he pitied Chun but that further investigation
was necessary: ``The truth must be clearly disclosed.''

   Erich Fried, a poet who translated Shakespeare's
works into modern German, died of cancer at age 67, his publisher
said today.
   He died Tuesday at a hospital in Baden-Baden, said Klaus
Wagenbach, his close friend and publisher in West Berlin.
   Fried, an Austrian Jew, was born in Vienna on May 6, 1921, but
fled his Nazi-ruled homeland in 1938. He spent most of the rest of
his life in Britain.
   He was known primarily for his political poems but also worked as
a journalist and translator.
   Over the past 20 years, he translated 27 of Shakespeare's works
into modern German as well as works by T.S. Eliot and Dylan Thomas.
   In some of his poems, Fried harshly criticized the Vietnam War
and the handling of student protests in Western countries.
   Among his best-known works are ``Und Vietnam Und'' (And Vietnam
And), ``Liebesgedichte'' (Love Poems), and ``Die Freiheit den Mund
aufzumachen'' (Freedom To Speak Openly).
   Fried is survived by his wife, Catherine.

<HEAD>Solidarity Charges Police With Beating Demonstrators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Solidarity human rights commission today
charged that police severely beat 108 demonstrators since Oct. 7 in
a ``wave of police violence,'' and it appealed to the Roman Catholic
Church for help.
   The Commission of Intervention and Lawfulness, appointed by
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, said police beat 51 people during the
Nov. 11 protests marking the 70th anniversary of Polish independence
after World War I.
   The commission monitors human rights abuses for Solidarity, the
independent trade union federation crushed by security forces in
1981 and outlawed in 1982.
   The panel today released a report naming the 108 people it said
were beaten and describing their injuries.
   In the report signed by its chairman, Zbigniew Romaszewski, the
panel said remarks by government spokesman Jerzy Urban that only two
people had been injured during the protests were ``notorious
disinformation.''
   At a Nov. 15 news conference, Urban said eight people were
detained and 39 people were questioned by police in the nationwide
demonstrations. He said the only injuries were in the southern city
of Katowice, where he said one person suffered a bruised knee and
another person a bruised shoulder.
   But the report said the anniversary was ``a day of peak intensity
of a ... wave of police violence.
   ``Are only death casualities ... capable of alarming society and
authorities of the existing danger?''
   The panel questioned government statements that demonstrators
started the violence by throwing stones at police.
   It cited statements from protesters in Poznan that the
rock-throwing was started by police in civilian clothes who mixed
with the crowd. The beatings seemed directed especially at
university and high school students, the commission said. Every
third high school student detained was beaten, it said.
   Other beatings listed in the report allegedly occurred between
Oct. 7 and Nov. 11 at various demonstrations.
   On Oct. 7, a day honoring Polish police, demonstrations mocking
the police force were staged across the country.
   The first victim listed in the report was allegedly beaten on
Oct. 7 for holding up a pro-Solidarity sign at the train station in
the northern port of Gdansk, where the federation was started in
1980.
   On the same day in Warsaw, a university student said he was held
down while police banged his head, hit him in the face and kicked
him in the stomach.
   Another student in Warsaw told the panel he was severely beaten,
and a third student said he was hit in the face with a baton and
kicked in the stomach.
   The panel reported similar incidents throughout Poland between
Oct. 9 and Nov. 11. It said some beatings involved miners attending
Solidarity meetings and rallies, and people attending Mass honoring
the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a priest slain by police.
   The Solidarity panel appealed to the church, to a parliamentary
human rights committee and to ``all of society'' to exert pressure
to end such beatings.

   Four blacks moved into primary runoffs in a
campaign to elect the first black member of the Dallas County
Commission in more than a century.
   A federal court ordered Tuesday's election in a legal dispute
that began in 1978, when the U.S. Justice Department said the
countywide election process diluted black voter strength in the
county, which is about 55 percent black.
   The change from at-large voting to five districts gave black
voters a majority in at least two of the districts in this county,
the site of one of the most famous voter registration struggles of
the civil rights movement.
   A black has not served on the commission since Reconstruction.
   ``We've been trying for 20 years to get a county commission that
represents everyone and Tuesday seems to be that day,'' said civil
rights activist J.L. Chestnut.
   As a result of Tuesday's balloting, two blacks will be in a
runoff for one district and will face white Republican opposition in
the general election.
   Two whites made it into runoffs with black candidates in black
districts. Whites will advance to the general election in two other
districts.
   Runoffs are set for Dec. 13 and the general election is scheduled
for Dec. 27.
   More than 30 federal observers monitored the voting, while in
Washington, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy rejected a
bid by the county school board for a review of the district plan.
   The number of black registered voters in the county has swelled
from 300 to more than 20,000 since enactment of the Voting Rights
Act in 1965, the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march that year
and the other bitter civil rights struggles in Selma in the 1960s.

   Three soldiers were killed and 126 people wounded
in Azerbaijan when riots triggered by a territorial dispute with
Armenia swept through two southern Soviet cities, an Azerbaijani
official said today.
   Musa Mamedov, chief of the information department of the
Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry, said the violence occurred in the
Azerbaijan cities of Nakhichevan and Kirovabad with the arrival of
Interior Ministry troops on Tuesday.
   ``Three soldiers were killed, perhaps by stones, perhaps by
sticks,'' Mamedov said in a telephone interview from Azerbaijan's
capital, Baku. ``A total of 126 people in the two cities were
injured.''
   He said a state of emergency was proclaimed in the two cities.
   It was the first official report of the death of soldiers or
policemen in Azerbaijan or Armenia since an ethnic dispute broke out
in February over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian region of
Azerbaijan whose legislature has demanded unification with Armenia.
   State-run Baku radio, monitored in London, said an unspecified
number of people also were injured in Nakhichevan, the
administrative center of an enclave of Azerbaijani territory that
borders Iran.
   The radio said crime and looting had been on the increase since
Monday, and people's lives were in danger. It said some police had
not been fulfilling their duties, but that ``the city's leadership
is taking immediate measures.''
   Mamedov said it was not known if ethnic Armenians who live in
Nakhichevan and Kirovabad were among those injured. ``Many Armenians
live in Kirovabad, so it's possible they were among the victims,''
he said.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
told a news briefing the situation in Baku was ``difficult.'' He
said there had been a disturbance in Kirovabad and that there were
casualties but did not elaborate.
   In February, anti-Armenian riots shook another Azerbaijan city,
Sumgait, and Soviet officials said 32 people, among them 26
Armenians, were killed. Armenians claim the death toll was much
higher.
   Tens of thousands of Armenians massed Tuesday night in Yerevan,
their capital, and voted to form ``self-defense squads'' as initial
news of the unrest in Azerbaijan became known in the city.
   In Baku, thousands of Azerbaijanis were reported gathered in the
main square today as round-the-clock, anti-Armenian protests there
entered a fifth day. A reporter with official Azerbaijan television
estimated the number of protesters at 800,000, almost half of Baku's
population of 1.7 million.
   The giant protests on Lenin Square were caused by news from
Nagorno-Karabakh that Armenians were trying to increase the Armenian
population of the Shusha district.
   Settlers were reportedly taken to the area a week ago in official
trucks, and began building barracks with materials supplied by the
Armenian government, according to a correspondent of the official
Azerbaijan news agency Azerinform, who spoke by telephone on
condition of anonymity.
   Baku Radio reported that ``indignant'' residents of the
Azerbaijani capital were holding non-stop rallies and demanding the
imposition of ``law and order'' and an end to the building project
in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   An editor for Azerinform who identified himself only as Perets
said 100,000 people, mostly students, were in Lenin Square this
afternoon but that their numbers were expected to swell to over 1
million after work let out.
   The Armenian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, broke off its session
Tuesday night because of increased tensions in the Caucasus region.
The legislature, which has approved the annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh, had been scheduled to discuss the issue again.
   Tens of thousands of Armenians gathered on Yerevan's Opera Square
after the Supreme Soviet halted its session, and approved the
creation of ``self-defense squads'' in areas of Armenia where
Azerbaijanis live, Rafael Popoyan, an Armenian activist, said by
telephone from Yerevan.
   About 300,000 Azerbaijanis, who are traditionally Moslem, live in
the largely Christian republic of Armenia, whose population is 3.5
million.
   Popoyan said the decision to create the self-defense groups was
taken by the Karabakh Committee, an independent group fighting for
Armenian reunification with Nagorno-Karabakh, and then read to the
crowd in Opera Square. The demonstrators also voted to continue a
protest strike in Yerevan that began Friday, Popoyan said.
   He said the situation in the city remained tense, with many
Armenians staying off the job and crowds of protesters gathering
again in Opera Square.
   Both the legislatures of Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia itself have
voted for the region's annexation by Armenia, but Azerbaijan has
rejected the transfer of sovereignty.
   In July, the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the nation's top executive
body, rejected any change in status for Nagorno-Karabakh. The
Kremlin opted instead for a long-term economic and social
development plan for the region.

<TEXT>
   American factory orders surged 2.4 percent last month for large
manufactured items, the government reported today, but the increase
came from a 41.1 percent jump in demand for military equipment,
mostly new warships.
   The Commerce Department said that excluding the military order
category, orders for durable goods fell 0.2 percent, the second
consecutive monthly drop.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, a measure of
business expansion plans, also fell for the second straight month.
It was down 2.6 percent to $34 billion, following a 10.2 percent
drop in September, the largest since January 1986.
   Durable goods are defined as big items ranging from refrigerators
to tanks and aircraft that are expected to last at least three
years. Orders are an important barometer of manufacturing strength,
but economists discount the military and transportation categories
because they fluctuate sharply from month to month.
   The weak dollar fell further in New York in morning trading in
reaction to the durable goods report, evidently reflecting pessimism
about the ability of U.S. manufacturers to compete well in world
markets without a cheaper currency.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up
about 4 points to the 2,082 level, and in the bond market prices
were little changed.
   Other unsettling economic news dominated the attention of
financial markets Tuesday, leaving the United States facing higher
consumer prices, a weaker dollar, more expensive oil and its biggest
budget deficit since March.
   The Labor Department said Tuesday that sharp increases for fall
and winter clothing last month put consumer price inflation back
around 5 percent annually, despite the smallest monthly increase in
food costs since February.
   Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in October _ or at an annual
rate of 5.1 percent vs. 4.1 percent in September _ with more than
half the gain coming from a 1.8 percent boost in apparel prices and
sharp increases in auto insurance and financing charges.
   Other inflation news came from the conference of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, Austria, where Iran gave
conflicting signals on whether a price-boosting pact was possible.
   The Iranians incited trading frenzies in the oil pits at the New
York Mercantile Exchange, where prices zoomed, collapsed and jumped
back up again in one of the wildest days in months. West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark crude oil, ended up 88 cents per barrel
to $13.86.
   None of these events helped the dollar, which continued declining
in value against foreign currencies, not only because they raised
inflation fears but also because of increasing anxiety that the Bush
administration will do little to stem staggering budget and trade
deficits.
   The dollar fell in New York trading from 122.03 yen to 121.31 yen
and from 1.728 West German marks to 1.718. In other markets, stocks
were slightly higher and bond prices slipped.
   Heightening concern about budget deficit was a Treasury
Department report showing the federal government spent $27.4 billion
more than it took in last month, the largest deficit since March.
   That level was down 10.9 percent from a year earlier, but the
decline was more than accounted for by temporary factors or one-time
accounting adjustments.
   The Reagan administration is projecting the budget deficit in
fiscal 1989 will shrink to $145.5 billion, down from $155.1 billion
in the year ended Sept. 30. The Congressional Budget Office projects
a $148 billion deficit.
   But most private economists are projecting a 1989 deficit little
improved and perhaps worse than 1988.

   Police investigating the strangling of a
7-year-old taped her picture to the wall and carried copies in their
wallets for nine weeks until they arrested her parents, who claimed
the child was stolen from her bed.
   ``We had an obligation to our profession to do this right and to
allay fears in these communities,'' said State Police Capt. Dan
McDevitt, who headed the investigation.
   ``But above all,'' he added, pointing to a picture of Jaclyn
Dowaliby on a bulletin board at the police station, ``we had an
obligation to her.''
   David and Cynthia Dowaliby were arrested Tuesday and charged with
murder. They were scheduled for a preliminary hearing today and were
held without bail.
   Dowaliby, 31, reported his daughter had been stolen from her bed
while he and his 26-year-old wife slept Sept. 10. Her body was found
four days later next to an apartment building in Blue Island.
   The investigation slowed when the Dowalibys refused to answer
further questions. Their attorney maintained they were being
harassed and had told police all they knew.
   Blue Island Police Chief Paul Greves declined to comment on the
findings of the investigation.
   Lawrence Hyman, attorney for Mrs. Dowaliby, said police had made
them ``scapegoats.''
   The investigation involved about 40 federal, state and local law
enforcement officers.
   ``There was no one key suspect from Day One. We followed
thousands of leads,'' Greves said. ``A lot of the investigators
carried her picture in their wallet while this went on.''
   Pulling a small photo of Jaclyn from his wallet, Greves added,
``I guess I can put this away now.''
   The couple's 4-year-old son, David, was taken into state custody,
McDevitt said. He was distraught about the arrests and was
hospitalized.

   President-elect George Bush asked today for an
end to news reports that he is about to name former Sen. John Tower
of Texas as defense secretary. Meanwhile, he did fill one post,
picking Brent Scowcroft as his national security adviser.
   ``I will put together a strong national security team. Now with
Brent Scowcroft at my side in the White House, we have taken a large
step in that direction,'' Bush said today.
   Asked about Tower, he replied that he was not yet ready to name
his Pentagon chief. And he added that he didn't like news stories
speculating on choices for various jobs.
   Such reports, he said, raise potential appointees' hopes, which
then can be dashed if ``it doesn't work out.''
   When asked if he would soon put Tower ``out of his misery, one
way or the other,'' he replied, ``I'm asking you to do that.''
   Tower's spokeswoman, Kim Garvin, said Tuesday, ``He's on hold. He
at present has not been asked.''
   Bush said the same thing Tuesday. ``No decision has been made,''
he told reporters traveling to Houston with him. The president-elect
indicated he would wait until after the Thanksgiving holiday to
announce his new Pentagon chief.
   Tower, 63, a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee from Texas, would be expected to deal effectively with
Congress, but some people have expressed qualms about his ability to
manage the multibillion-dollar a year agency.
   One scenario calls for a top manager, perhaps Paul O'Neill, the
chief executive officer of Alcoa, to serve as Tower's No. 2,
effectively running the Pentagon bureaucracy.
   O'Neill also has been mentioned as a possible defense secretary,
as have Donald Rumsfeld, a former Pentagon chief, Rep. Jack Kemp of
New York, procurement expert Norman Augustine and even Sen. Sam
Nunn, a Georgia Democrat.
   Whatever choice is made for Pentagon chief, Tower is expected to
land some kind of plum in the Bush administration in part because he
campaigned tirelessly for Bush's victory.
   Bush has said he will move expeditiously on appointments, but he
won't be rushed.
   Bush has already filled a number of jobs: Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady will remain in their posts.
   Richard Darman, a former Treasury official, will head the Office
of Management and Budget, former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III will become secretary of state, and New Hampshire Gov. John
Sununu has been selected as White House chief of staff.
   Here's the latest thinking on some other top agency and executive
posts.
   _ Agriculture. No new names surfaced Tuesday. Still in the
running are Robert Delano, former president of the American Farm
Bureau Federation; Clayton Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative;
Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash.; and Rep. Thomas Coleman of Missouri.
   _ Energy. Former Rep. Thomas Loeffler, who ran Bush's campaign in
Texas, is a strong contender. Also talked about are former White
House aide Fred Khedouri, former deputy secretary William Martin and
Evans.
   _ Interior. This is one of the many jobs for which Evans' name
has been floated. Others on the list include Nathaniel Reed, a
former assistant secretary, Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming, former EPA
director William Ruckelshaus and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander.
   _ CIA. The list has been pretty stable on who might succeed CIA
Director William Webster, but no decision has been made. Those on it
include James Lilley, the ambassador to Korea; Scowcroft; national
security adviser Colin Powell; Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and
William Hyland, editor of Foreign Affairs magazine. Webster, who
could be offered an interim appointment, has said little on the
issue.
   _ U.N. Ambassador. Alan Keyes, a former State Department
official, is a contender along with Maureen Reagan, President
Reagan's daughter; former Rep. Ed Derwinski and former national
security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.
   _ Health and Human Services. The same names keep cropping up for
this huge agency. They include Dorcas Hardy, the Social Security
commissioner; Rep. Willis Gradison of Ohio; Sen. Lowell Weicker of
Connecticut and Deborah Steelman, a campaign aide to Bush. Rep.
Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican who will move to the Senate in
January, said Tuesday that he had written a letter to the Bush
transition team recommending former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, R-Calif.,
for the job.
   _ Transportation. Matthew Scocozza, a private lawyer who worked
as an assistant secretary, has emerged as a candidate. Other
possibles are Sam Skinner, chairman of Chicago's Regional Transit
Authority; Rep. Guy Molinari of New York; Peter Schabarum, an urban
transportation expert; James Burnett, former head of the National
Transportation Safety Board; Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Allan
McArtor, the administrator at the Federal Aviation Administration.
   _ Labor. Rep. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania is a leading contender,
as is William Kilberg, a Washington lawyer who worked in the
department in the Nixon administration. Ann Dore McLaughlin, the
current secretary, could keep the job, but she'll have stiff
competition from Ridge, Kilberg and former Rep. John Ehrlenborn of
Illinois.
   _ Housing and Urban Development. Possibilities are Cleveland
Mayor George Voinovich, Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut,
businessman Robert Woodson and campaign official Thaddeus Garrett.
   _ Commerce. Houston oilman Robert Mosbacher, a longtime friend of
Bush, is believed to have the job nailed down if he wants it. Others
on the list are former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth and James Robinson, head of American
Express Co.
   _ Veterans. Ridge has been mentioned, as has Everett Alvarez, a
former deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration, retired
Gen. Pete Dawkins and former Sen. Jeremiah Denton.

<HEAD>Dolphins Who Were Stranded In Cairo Pool Arrive In France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two peforming dolphins who were stranded for months
in a classy Cairo swimming pool arrived in France today after being
spirited out of Egypt to avoid a legal battle that could have kept
them there.
   Leo and Nemo, flown to France in a ZAS Boeing 707, were placed in
a hospital pool at Marineland Cote d'Azur, according to Dr. David
Taylor, a veterinarian caring for the animals. They immediately
began to eat.
   ``They're in very, very good spirits. They're eating extremely
well, eating high quality herring,'' Taylor said in a telephone
interview.
   He was hopeful about Nemo, who is suffering from pneumonia in one
lung, liver trouble and skin problems. Both animals had grown
lethargic after a year of swimming in circles in the pool of Cairo's
Meridien hotel.
   The dolphins were brought to the Meridien last November to
perform in the main pool for guests during the winter season. But
they were stranded there after the contract allegedly expired May
31, with the owners, the International Dolphin Show Co., saying it
had nowhere to take them.
   Edouard Speck, the Meridien hotel general manager, has said the
hotel is taking Leo's and Nemo's owners to court to decide the
animals' eventual fate.
   A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 27.
   Bruno Lienhardt of Switzerland, the owner of the
Liechtenstein-based company which owns the dolphins, said the
contract was not due to expire until May 1989, but in April the
hotel decided it wanted to use its pool for guests.
   ``I traveled everywhere to find a suitable pool for the
dolphins,'' he told The Associated Press in Cairo. ``I couldn't find
anything in one month.''
   Taylor said Lienhardt, learning of the dolphins planned
departure, began obtaining court injunctions to freeze their
movement.
   Taylor said travel plans on Air France were changed and the
dolphins were spirited from the Meridien pool in the dark of night
onto another carrier. ``It was a very smooth, fast operation.''
   ``What counts at the bottom of the pile is the animals'
welfare,'' said Taylor who is a specialist on exotic animals. He is
part of the International Zoo Veterinary Group based in Lightwater,
outside London.

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush today selected
Brent Scowcroft, Gerald Ford's national security adviser, to fill
the same position in the new administration.
   Bush called Scowcroft, a 63-year-old retired Air Force lieutenant
general, ``a trusted friend'' who ``understands the White House, the
way (Capitol) Hill works and the intelligence community as well.''
   The vice president made the announcement before heading for his
oceanside family retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, for a five-day
Thanksgiving vacation. Bush has suggested he will complete the
naming of his Cabinet within a month.
   Bush called Scowcroft ``an honest broker'' and said, ``Because of
his tremendous experience, obviously he will convey to me,
unvarnished, his own view on policy matters of tremendous
importance.''
   Bush said the ``national security adviser has to have direct
access, day and night. I will be one who takes a keen interest in
these matters. I have a lot of ideas. They need to be tempered by
his experience and judgment.''
   Scowcroft said he agrees with Bush that ``the future holds for
the United States tremendous challenges and also opportunities. I'm
looking forward to helping him cope successfully with the challenges
and to take full advantage of the opportunities.''
   Asked about changes instituted at the National Security Counsel
after the Iran-Contra affair, Scowcroft said, ``I am very pleased. I
think that Gen. (Colin) Powell and Secretary (Frank) Carlucci before
him have left the NSC staff in really excellent condition, and it
will be a joy to assume responsibility for the system the way it is
operating now.''
   As he had Tuesday, Bush deflected questions concerning reports
that he was planning to name former Sen. John Tower as his defense
secretary. He complained that speculation on various appointments
merely raises potential appointees' hopes, which then can be dashed
if ``it doesn't work out.''
   Asked if he would soon put Tower ``out of his misery, one way or
the other,'' he replied, ``I'm asking you to do that.''
   Tower, the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, was most recently in the public eye as chairman of
President Reagan's commission to look into the Iran-Contra affair.
Scowcroft was one of the two other members, along with former
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie.
   Bush was asked about Scowcroft's reputation for caution in
dealing with the Soviets.
   ``Do I share the caution he has sometimes signaled? The answer is
yes,'' Bush said. ``That doesn't mean there won't be forward
progress.''
   Bush noted his Dec. 7 meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and said, ``I will have an opportunity to make that very
clear to Mr. Gorbachev. What I won't be able to make clear to him
is, here's our detailed arms control formulation.''
   The president-elect praised Powell, the outgoing national
security adviser, as ``an outstanding adviser to the president of
the United States. He's won the confidence of the president, of the
Capitol, and of all of us for whom he's worked.''
   The vice president said he did not now what Powell's future would
hold.
   In answer to reporters' questions, Scowcroft said:
   _ ``There's no question'' that there are serious problems in the
defense budget. ``It is substantially underfunded and Secretary
Carlucci has already taken some very courageous steps in the
direction of readjusting the defense program. More has to be done.''
   _ On asking U.S. allies to bear more of the defense load, ``It's
of course especially important for the United States at this
particular time. But I think it's also important to approach this
general issue cooperatively with our allies, not combatively.''
   _ It was too soon to say whether the START talks with the Soviets
would resume on schedule in the new year.
   _ It would be ``very premature'' to say whether he would retain
Bush's national security aide, Donald Gregg, or whom he might name
to the national security staff.
   Scowcroft also served as an arms control adviser to President
Jimmy Carter and who headed a special commission in 1983 that
studied basing of the MX missile.
   Scowcroft served as a deputy to Henry Kissinger when Kissinger
served both as secretary of state and national security adviser
during the Nixon and Ford administrations.
   When Kissinger surrendered the national security post in 1975,
Scowcroft was named to fill the job.
   A 1947 graduate of West Point, he became an officer in the Air
Force. He served as a professor of Russian history and political
science at both West Point and the Air Force Academy. In the early
1970s, he served as President Nixon's military assistant.
   On Tuesday, Bush met in Houston with incoming Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari for a get-acquainted session. Both he and
Salinas, who takes office Dec. 1, called the meeting a first step
toward improved U.S.-Mexican relations.
   Over a six-course lunch that included roasted pheasant and gilded
chocolate truffles, Bush and Salinas discussed drugs, immigration,
trade and Mexico's staggering $102 billion international debt, aides
said.
   ``I am absolutely confident after this initial visit that we're
both committed to improving a bilateral relationship that is
essential, in my view, as far as the United States of America is
concerned,'' Bush said in brief remarks after talks that lasted two
hours.
   Salinas, using similarly upbeat diplomatic language that
disclosed few specifics, called the session ``a positive,
respectful, cordial dialogue which I am certain will do a great deal
to improve the relations between Mexico and the United States.''
   Bush thanked Salinas for greeting him in his adopted hometown.
Salinas, speaking through a translator, invited Bush to visit him
next time in Mexico City.
   The vice president, in remarks applied to both Mexico and Canada,
pledged to ``never neglect our own friends in this hemisphere.''
   In an address earlier Tuesday to a meeting of Republican
governors in Point Clear, Ala., Bush congratulated Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney for a ``spectacular win'' in Monday's
national elections that retained a House of Commons majority for
Mulroney's Conservative party.
   Bush called the election a ringing endorsement not only for the
prime minister, but for the recently negotiated U.S.-Canadian
free-trade pact whose fate had become a campaign issue.
   Bush also told the Republican Governors Association he would name
negotiators for budget talks with Congress ``on the first day of my
presidency,'' suggesting a possible intention to sidestep the usual
practice in which a new president first submits his own budget
proposals.
   He said he viewed his election as a mandate against new taxes.

   Temple University has formally recognized a
student group that promotes white pride, entitling the organization
to a faculty adviser, the use of university facilities and $1,000 a
year in support.
   Temple spokeswoman Kathy Gosliner said Tuesday that officials
recognized the White Student Union after reviewing its application
with a lawyer.
   ``It has nothing to do with whether we agree with what they
believe,'' she said. ``We adhere strongly to principles of free
speech.''
   Michael Spletzer, a 22-year-old senior and architecture major,
said he formed the group to balance what he called the
``pro-minority'' stance taken by Temple with its minority
scholarships, affirmative action program and educational philosophy.
   ``There has never been a voice for the rights and feelings of
whites on campus,'' Spletzer said. He said he is is not a white
supremacist.
   ``The rights of white Americans are being stepped on all over,''
he added.
   Spletzer said the group has 89 members; Ms. Gosliner said said
she did not know how many people are in the White Student Union, but
four people signed the application for recognition. She said the
group must be open to all students.
   Recognition entitles organizations to the use of certain
university facilities, a faculty adviser, the right to be considered
for office space and $1,000 a year for student activities, said
another Temple spokesman, George Ingram.
   Temple NAACP president Vaughn Goodwin expressed concern about the
formation of the group.
   ``For one race to come out and say racial pride of others is just
talk is indirectly indoctrinating racism,'' said Goodwin, a
19-year-old junior majoring in public relations.
   Goodwin said he if WSU activities suggest racism, ``we will take
direct action'' against the group.

   Sinhalese militants have killed 13
Sinhalese people in attacks throughout the country in the past two
days, police and military officials said today.
   Also today, a bomb exploded in a passenger bus, injuring 15, the
officials said. The attack took place in Matara, 85 miles south of
Colombo.
   The officials, who under briefing rules cannot be identified,
said a police inspector and a government-sponsored food retailer
were among 13 victims killed by Sinhalese militants since Tuesday.
   They said those killed were either supporters of the governing
United National Party or members of the People's Liberation Front.
   The front, a radical Sinhalese group, has vowed to disrupt next
month's presidential elections. The group has been blamed for more
than 550 killings in the past 15 months. Members of the front have
attacked the government of President J.R. Jayewardene because of its
plans for ending a 5-year-old insurrection by Tamil guerrillas.
   The front contends an Indian-sponsored accord signed by
Jayewardene in July 1987 makes too many concessions to the Tamil
ethnic minority. It says 47,000 Indian troops now deployed in Sri
Lanka to disarm Tamil guerrillas under terms of the accord are
violating the island nation's sovereignty.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
control the administration and the military. Tamils comprise 18
percent.
   Militant Tamils claim they need a separate nation to protect them
from discrimination by the Sinhalese majority in culture, education
and employment.
   More than 8,500 people, mostly Sinhalese, have been killed since
the Tamil rebellion started in 1983.

   With storms lashing the West and the Southeast and air fares
climbing today, many Americans headed home early for Thanksgiving to
get a jump on the busiest travel day of the year, and officials
braced for millions more.
   ``Everybody here knows it's going to be extra busy around this
time, so we put some extra people on,'' said Debra Ingram, a
spokeswoman at Newark (N.J.) International Airport, where traffic
was heavy Tuesday. ``Other than that, we just pray a lot.''
   The Western storm howled into Oregon with 75 mph winds and dumped
heavy rain on northern California on Tuesday, delaying San Francisco
flights up to two hours, causing officials in New York to hold
departures for that city and snarling commuter traffic.
   Four Trees, Calif., in the northern Sierra Nevada, received nine
inches of rain in the 24 hours ending at 4 a.m. The rain was
expected to continue through tonight.
   In the East, Tropical Storm Keith hit Florida's west coast today
with 65 mph winds and heavy rain.
   Officials at major Florida airports did not expect the foul
weather to affect holiday travel. ``We anticipate the airplanes will
be able to slip by the storm on the side or fly over it,'' said Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport spokesman Jim Reynolds.
   The Western storm was expected to dump as much as 36 inches of
snow in the Sierra Nevada, including up to 18 inches around Lake
Tahoe, and leave heavy snow in most mountain areas of the West as it
spread to the northern Plains today. Wind gusts of more than 50 mph
were reported overnight in Redding, Calif.
   ``We've got about an inch (of snow) already,'' Trudy England, who
runs England's Lodging in Government Gamp, Ore., about five miles
south of Mount Hood, said Tuesday night. ``It's cold and snowing
steadily, so we expect more.''
   Eight inches of snow fell overnight at Stampede Pass in the
Snoqualmie National Forest of central Washington.
   Motorists in parts of the West were urged to check travel
conditions before setting out on long Thanksgiving journeys or to
prepare for mid-winter driving.
   Nationally, authorities were braced for a holiday jam of
motorists today. The Highway Patrol planned a ``turkey watch'' in
the desert outside Los Angeles for those violating speed, safety
belt and other traffic laws.
   The National Safety Council said 450 to 550 people may die in
traffic accidents between 6 p.m. Wednesday and midnight Sunday.
During a non-holiday, four-day weekend, about 390 people could
expect to be killed. Last year, 494 people died during Thanksgiving
weekend.
   For air travelers, the cost of flying went up at midnight Tuesday.
   The nation's biggest airlines went ahead with plans announced
last week to boost their lowest discount air fares and eliminate
cheap fares that can be booked a few days in advance. Among those
making the changes were United Airlines, American Airlines,
Northwest Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
   The new fares were not expected to affect the volume of
Thanksgiving travel, Delta spokesman Bill Berry said at the
carrier's Atlanta headquarters.
   ``Those fares going into effect require advance purchase, so they
will be for later travel,'' Berry said. ``The people traveling this
weekend made their reservations some time ago.''
   Officials prepared for a flood of fliers.
   More than 200,000 passengers today were expected to pass through
the nation's busiest airport, Chicago's O'Hare International. On a
normal day, 120,000 to 150,000 use the airport. The Chicago Transit
Authority planned longer trains and more fare handlers for rides
from downtown to O'Hare.
   At Boston's Logan International Airport, 78,000 travelers were
expected, an increase of 30 percent from the normal number. The
Massachusetts Port Authority planned extra buses, vans and water
shuttles and urged fliers to ride instead of drive to Logan to
minimize airport traffic jams.
   At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, about 136,000
passengers were anticipated, up from 105,000 normally.
   At Newark International on Tuesday night, Zelder Hillard,
arriving from Charlotte, N.C., to visit relatives in Paterson, N.J.,
said 35 people couldn't make her flight from North Carolina because
of the crush of travel.
   Ms. Hillard said Piedmont Airlines offered passengers a free
round-trip ticket anywhere in the United States if they would give
up their seats.
   ``Most of the people seemed to want to get home,'' Ms. Hillard,
20, said. ``Only about three or four people gave up their seats.''

   Confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi today contested evidence against him, claiming a taped
conversation between Beirut Airport authorities and the seized plane
were from another hijacking.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem accused of murder and air piracy
in the June 1985 hijacking, interrupted testimony to say the
Arabic-language conversation introduced as evidence was not an
exchange between him and the Beirut control tower.
   ``I think I recognize now that the last part of the tape concerns
another hijacking that had nothing to do with TWA,'' Hamadi told the
court. He did not say what hijacking he believed the tape referred
to.
   Alen Mousa, the Lebanese who translated the taped conversation
for West German authorities, was testifying when Hamadi interrupted
him. Mousa told the court he could not be sure if any of the voices
on the tape belonged to Hamadi.
   Hamadi's defense attorneys made a motion for further examination
of the tape.
   During the 17-day hijacking ordeal, U.S. Navy diver Richard
Stethem was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage aboard TWA
Flight 847, seized en route from Athens to Rome and diverted to
Beirut and Algiers.
   Hamadi has admitted he and an accomplice hijacked the plane, but
he denied killing Stethem. His alleged accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine,
remains at large.
   On Tuesday, Houston businessman Allyn Conwell told the court he
was so ``terrorized that I was virtually immobile'' while on board
the seized plane. He said he feared the captors planned to shoot him
and other Americans who were taken to hiding places in Beirut.
   Four American servicemen were removed from the plane by
Hezbollah, a radical Shiite Moslem group backed by Iran, while
Conwell's group was in the custody of Amal, a Shiite militia that
collaborated with the hijackers.
   Conwell said he learned from members of Amal, whom he described
as less extreme than the two hijackers, that Hamadi and his
accomplice wanted to bring all of the hostages back on board and
blow up the plane.
   ``I was under the impression that Amal absolutely did not approve
of the hijacking and the murder of Stethem,'' Conwell testified. ``I
think they acted to the best of their ability in a chaotic
situation.''
   Conwell said members of Amal told him ``the original hijackers
were getting very upset over the lack of progress in negotiations''
for the release of the hostages.
   ``I was told the intention was to return all the hostages to the
plane and blow it up,'' Conwell said.
   He said Amal officials indicated to him that the two hijackers
were from Hezbollah. Hamadi has denied being a member of that group.
   Also Tuesday, another former American hostage testified that
Hamadi, when told an American serviceman aboard the plane was
suffering chest pains, responded ``Let him die.''
   Sue Ellen Herzberg also told the court that she felt ``degraded
to an animal state'' during the hijacking.
   Hamadi, who was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987
after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage, has
been on trial since July.

   A crowd greeted a young Vietnamese boat
refugee who made it to the United States alone after watching his
parents and brother die at sea while starving shipmates resorted to
cannibalism.
   As Hung Quoc Tran's grandmother fell sobbing to her knees on an
airport concourse Tuesday night, the 10-year-old boy quietly shed a
single tear that streaked the blue union of a .
   The flag, presented to Hung by Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., had
flown over the U.S. Capitol.
   ``I think he'll feel right at home. It's a beautiful ending, a
happy ending,'' Anthony said.
   The folded U.S. flagboy was aboard a crowded boat found drifting without
food or
water in the South China Sea June 9 by a U.S. Navy ship, the USS
Dubuque, which gave them some supplies but left without taking any
of the 100 refugees aboard.
   The Dubuque's commander, Capt. Alexander G. Balian, was relieved
of duty after the incident. He was charged with failing to render
assistance.
   Survivors said a 12-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy were
murdered and eaten aboard the 35-foot cra the
boy's family left Vietnam illegally by boat after their efforts for
official emigration clearance failed. They set out in May hoping to
reach the Arkansas town of El Dorado, where Tong had settled and
raised a family after fleeing Saigon in 1975.
   ``We worried. We knew my brother was coming. But no word, no
word,'' said Tong.
   In June, Tong got word from the Philippines that her brother,
sister-in-law and nephew were dead. But she learned that Hung was
alive, plucked from the boat in June by Filipino fishermen and
detained in a United Nations camp at Puerto Princesa in the
Philippines.
   ``I was so worried _ he's only 10 years old and all alone,'' she
said. Tong began sending letters to officials, aiming to bring the
orphan to El Dorado.
   With urging from Arkansas' congressional delegation and the U.S.
Catholic Conference, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
granted Hung refugee status, and the Catholic organization
coordinated his trip from the Philippines.
   As Hung stepped from a jet at Little Rock Regional Airport,
onlookers applauded and his family surged forward to meet him.
   The boy leaned into his aunt's arms, awed by the attention he was
receiving. He whispered to her.
   ``He says thank you. He's happy to see Grandma,'' Tong said.
   Anthony said he hoped Hung's story would publicize the plight of
Vietnamese refugees who are stalled in camps like the one at Puerto
Princesa, where the 4,000 detainees include about 300 minors.
   ``The shame of it is you have a lot of young boys just like this
whose parents die or they try to come over here with friends or
relatives,'' the congressman said. ``It takes two or three years,
sometimes, to process them.''
   Hung also got a letter of greeting from Gov. Bill Clinton, along
with an invitation relayed by an aide to visit Clinton at the state
Capitol.

   Three U.S. soldiers were killed in
a nighttime training operation in Bavaria when their tank fell into
a pit and overturned, the U.S. Army reported today.
   The accident Sunday night at the Hohenfels military training
grounds also injured another soldier, Army spokesman 1st Lt. Patrick
Sawyer said in a telephone interview from 3rd Infantry Division
headquarters in Wuerzburg.
   Sawyer identified the dead soldiers as: Capt. Donald M. Kessler,
31, of Canton, Ga.; Staff Sgt. James Frear, 30, of Deridder, La.;
and Spec. Anthony T. Tallos, 20, of Philadelphia. Pvt. Dean C. Brown
was released after being treated for minor injuries, Sawyer said.
   The accident occurred when the men inadvertently drove the tank
into a pit normally used as a fighting position for military
vehicles during combat maneuvers, Sawyer said.
   Army authorities are investigating the accident.
   The Hohenfels military training area is 75 miles northwest of
Munich.

   Police in the southern province of
Kosovo today banned all mass gatherings after five days of the
region's biggest rallies in more than four decades of Communist rule.
   In the neighboring southern republic of Macedonia, meanwhile,
15,000 people protested what they said was discrimination against
the ethnic Macedonian minority in northern Greece.
   The indefinite ban on mass gatherings in Kosovo was announced by
the state-run news agency Tanjug. It quoted Rahman Morina, Kosovo's
chief of interior affairs, as saying ``extraordinary circumstances
have taken place which threaten public order.
   ``All those failing to comply (with the decree) will be subject
to all legal and other measures.'' Tanjug did not elaborated.
   The decree said the ban on mass gatherings ``should not affect
normal development of public and cultural life of citizens.''
   The protests in Kosovo were triggered by the forced resignations
Nov. 17 of two ethnic Albanian leaders, Kacusa Jasari and Azem
Vlasi, under pressure from the Communist Party leadership in the
republic of Serbia.
   The move sparked the largest demonstrations ever in the province,
with up to 100,000 people noisily demanding the reinstatement of
Jasari and Vlasi.
   Provincial party leaders have promised to review Jasari's and
Vlasi's resignations at a meeting tentatively scheduled later this
week.
   No demonstrations were reported Tuesday or early today from
Kosovo's capital of Pristina, 240 miles south of Belgrade.
   But the ban _ and a provision forbidding marchers from entering
Pristina _ indicated officials feared further demonstrations.
   Observers believe there might be renewed protests if the two
ethnic Albanian leaders' resignations are not reversed.
   Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian Communist Party leader, pushed
hard for the resignations as part of his drive to gain more control
of Kosovo.
   Kosovo won broad autonomy under the 1974 constitution. Milosevic
wants the situation changed to protect the Serb and Montenegrin
minorities in Kosovo from alleged ethnic Albanian harassment.

<HEAD>Northern Illinois Suspends Fraternity after Skit Labeled Racist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DE KALB, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Illinois University has suspended a
fraternity for performing a skit in blackface and Afro wigs.
   Administrators were considering whether to take further action
against Sigma Chi, which was suspended Monday, said Jon Dalton, NIU
vice president for student affairs.
   ``This conduct is of a most serious nature and I believe tht very
serious sanctions are necessary,'' he said.
   Five Sigma Chi members performed a parody of The Temptations, the
black singing group, at a charity fund-raiser Sunday. Students and
others in the audience complained that the skit was racist, Dalton
said.
   ``We are making sure that the chapter has publicly and in writing
apologized to other Greek organizations as well as to the black
student organizations,'' said Fred Yoder, spokesman for the
fraternity's international headquarters.
   Under the suspension, Sigma Chi cannot meet as a campus
organization, have parties or participate in intramural sports,
Yoder said.
   The university could ban the fraternity, continue the suspension,
replace its officers or otherwise restrict its activities.
   Yoder said he did not know if there were any blacks among the 85
members of the chapter.
   In 1987, students in a van shouted slurs at people attending a
speech by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Three days later, flyers bearing
racial insults and swastikas appeared on campus buses.
   Later in the year, a race-baiting publication called ``Stump''
was distributed on campus.

   Tropical Storm Keith blustered ashore today,
spawning tornadoes, flooding streets, knocking down power lines and
forcing more than 600 people to evacuate, including residents of a
nursing home.
   A Pacific storm, meanwhile, pummeled Oregon with 75 mph winds and
unleashed nearly 4 inches of rain Tuesday.
   Florida residents and tourists generally dismissed Keith's 65 mph
gusts and heavy rains as a nuisance, not a danger.
   ``We're treating it like a bad thunderstorm,'' said George
Miller, manager of the Best Western Sea Wake Inn in Clearwater Beach.
   Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables said
Keith's center made landfall shortly after 1 a.m. near Sarasota,
about 50 miles south of Tampa.
   Space Shuttle Atlantis remained on the launch pad awaiting an
early December liftoff. Workers sealed exposed areas near the engine
to prevent rain damage and retracted the elevator access arm to
protect shuttle tiles if the craft begins to shake, said George
Diller, a Kennedy Space Center spokesman. The shuttle can easily
withstand the storm's wind and rain, he said.
   At 11 a.m., the storm was about 40 miles off Cape Canaveral,
moving east-northeast at 15-20 mph. Most winds over the mainland had
dropped below 40 mph.
   The storm dumped 5 inches of rain or more in Tampa, Orlando and
Daytona Beach and brought tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.
   ``It appears at the moment that Sarasota may have experienced the
most substantial damange,'' said Dick Morgan, spokesman for the
state Division of Emergency Management. ``There appears to be
considerable road damage.''
   Schools were closed in three counties, he said.
   A tropical storm warning was issued for the 250 miles from Cape
Sable at the state's southwestern tip, north to Cedar Key on the
Gulf Coast. Forecasters extended the warning late Tuesday to the
Atlantic Coast from Jupiter Inlet, north of Palm Beach, to Savannah,
Ga.
   However, forecasters said a cold front from the north mingled
with Keith in the Gulf of Mexico and sapped its strength. Tropical
storms thrive on warm, moist arm but the front fed cool, dry air
into Keith, said hurricane specialist Bob Case.
   At 11 a.m. forecasters lifted all tropical storm warnings along
the Florida and Georgia coasts as Keith moved out to sea.
   Officials early today reported 250 residents of low-lying areas
in the St. Petersburg area were in shelters; about 140 were in eight
shelters in the Tampa Bay area and 147 were in four shelters in
Clearwater, said Jeanne Ann Crutchfield, a spokeswoman for the
American Red Cross in St. Petersburg.
   Fewer than a dozen were at a shelter in Venice in Sarasota County
and the 96 residents of Shore Acres Nursing Home in St. Petersburg
Beach were taken to two other nursing homes because of a danger of
flooding.
   All three causeways connecting St. Petersburg and Tampa were
closed late Tuesday because of high winds.
   On Tuesday, 85 multimillion-dollar F-16 jets were flown from
MacDill Air Force Base to Dobbins Air Force Base at Marietta, Ga.,
to wait out the storm.
   A 216-foot freighter with 10 people aboard stalled Tuesday, about
140 miles west of Fort Myers in 15-foot seas and more than 63 mph
winds, the Coast Guard said. Rescue ships and helicopters were
dispatched and the ship was safely in tow to Tampa this morning,
Coast Guard spokesman Jerry Snyder said.
   At least two tornadoes were spotted near St. Petersburg early
today, but there were no immediate reports of injury or damage,
authorities said.
   In Lake County, a tornado struck a mobile home park south of
Leesburg, then skipped across a field and hit another park Tuesday
morning, said Bob Reymont, director for emergency management.
   No one was injured, but Reymont said 20 to 25 trailer homes, two
vans, a small boat and a car were damaged, many only slightly.
   On Monday, Keith's rain soaked an area from Mexico to the Florida
Keys. On Cuba, civil defense authorities report at least 2,500
people were evacuated.
   If Keith's winds reach over 74 mph, it would become the sixth
hurricane of the Atlantic storm season, which runs from June through
Nov. 30. Keith is the 11th named storm of the season.
   By nightfall in Oregon, snow had begun to fall in higher
elevations, with forecasters calling for up to 2 feet in the
mountain passes by today.
   Downed tree limbs cut some power lines, blacking out areas in
Clackamas County southeast of Portland, said Michael Tevlin, a
spokesman for Portland General Electric Co. Scattered power outages
and flooded intersections also were reported in Bend, just east of
the Cascades.

   Palestinians shut down the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip with a general strike today to protest the
deportation of dozens of Palestinians in the yearlong uprising.
   Police recommended that prominent Jewish settler Rabbi Moshe
Levinger be tried in the shooting death of a Palestinian, a
Parliament member said.
   Also today, two Palestinian teen-agers and a 5-year-old boy were
shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops during the
general strike, called by PLO underground leaders of the uprising,
hospital officials said.
   Israel radio said an army officer was sentenced to two weeks in
prison for failing to stop a rampage in which troops smashed houses
and overturned cars after the soldiers were stoned in a refugee camp
in the West Bank.
   The officer, a second lieutenant, was sentenced Tuesday in a
quick trial after the incident in the Kalandia camp a day earlier,
the radio said. The army said it was checking the report.
   The left-wing Peace Now movement became the first Israeli group
to respond positively to the PLO's implicit recognition of Israel.
   The PLO did so when its parliament-in-exile met in Algiers and
declared an independent state in the occupied lands.
   ``In Algiers the PLO abandoned the path of rejection ... and
adopted the path of political compromise,'' said a Peace Now
advertisement in the Jerusalem Post. ``The government of Israel must
call for direct negotiations with the PLO on the basis of mutual
recognition and cessation of violence,'' said the ad by Peace Now,
which was founded during peace negotiations with Egypt in 1978.
   The Israeli government has rejected the PLO's acceptance of U.N.
Security Council Resolution 242, which implicitly recognizes Israel.
   A 13-year-old Palestinian boy died today of a bullet wound to the
head suffered during a clash with troops on Saturday in the village
of Beita near Nablus, the army said. Arab reports identified him as
Amar Muhib Hamayel.
   He was the 315th Palestinian to be killed since the uprising
against Israeli rule began Dec. 8. Eleven Israelis also have died.
   Ran Cohen, a member of Parliament from the left-wing Citizens
Rights Movement, said police recommended charges against Levinger, a
settler leader in Hebron who allegedly opened fire during a
rock-throwing attack in the West Bank city. Kayed Hassan Salah, 42,
was killed outside his store and another Palestinian was wounded in
the shooting Sept. 30.
   Cohen quoted a letter from District Police Superintendent Eitan
Katz saying investigators recommended on Oct. 26 ``to put Rabbi
Levinger on trial for causing death and wounding another person
while using firearms.''
   Asked about the police recommendation, Justice Ministry
spokeswoman Etty Eshed said: ``There's no decision yet. We are short
of people and every case is important. I assume they would decide in
the case soon ... a week to 10 days.''

   A former security aide to Lyndon H.
LaRouche Jr. told LaRouche's conspiracy trial today that the
political maverick lied to his employees, gave orders while drunk
and let his lieutenants harass political figures.
   Charles Tate told jurors he quit the LaRouche organization in
disgust four years ago after he saw LaRouche staffers ``insulted and
humiliated'' by LaRouche and others.
   Tate came under sharp questioning from defense attorney William
Moffitt, who tried to show the jury that Tate harbored malice toward
his former employer.
   LaRouche and six associates are charged with conspiracy to
defraud those who loaned the political organization money, while
LaRouche alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service by failing to pay taxes.
   Under cross-examination, Tate admitted he went to a Halloween
party of former LaRouche staffers in 1986 where he did an imitation
of LaRouche giving orders while _ Tate said _ the leader was under
the influence of alcohol.
   Under direct examination from prosecutor John Markham, Tate said
he quit the LaRouche organization four years ago because the
movement had ``contempt for decent ordinary humanity.''
   ``I had witnessed Mr. LaRouche lie to the membership again and
again,'' Tate testified. ``I had seen revolting actions.''
   ``I had seen members of the organization insulted and
humiliated,'' he said.
   Tate said the organization harassed political figures, from
liberals to conservatives, and LaRouche followers assumed false
identities to gain information on their enemies.
   In earlier testimony, Tate said a 12-member security staff played
``maid and butler'' to LaRouche, catering to every personal need
during the years LaRouche declared no taxable income.
   According to a federal grand jury, LaRouche conspired to defraud
the IRS by not filing tax returns since 1979, and by failing to
declare the cost of personal services as income. The grand jury also
charged LaRouche and six co-defendants with conspiring to defraud
those who loaned the LaRouche movement money, by resolving not to
pay them back.
   Tate quoted chief LaRouche fund-raiser William Wertz as telling
staffers ``there was no such thing as a loan'' and money given as
loans should not be repaid barring a ``political downside'' or a
threatened lawsuit. Tate said those remarks caused him to quit
LaRouche's organization in 1984.
   Tate said the security staff had round-the-clock shifts, playing
``maid and butler'' to LaRouche and his wife, Helga, whether they
were at their residences in New York City, their 40-acre estate in
the horse country of Leesburg, Va., hotels or their home of Mainz,
West Germany.
   Chores included serving food, cleaning, walking Mrs. LaRouche's
dog, caring for her horses, maintaining LaRouche's fleet of
limousines, and grocery shopping, he said.
   Tate described Wertz as someone whose steel-tough discipline
brought internal dissension among LaRouche staffers. Wertz ordered a
military style daily roll call and exhorted the staff to ``take the
beachhead'' and ``capture the bridges,'' the witness said.
   Sometimes, Tate testified, Wertz quoted World War II hero Gen.
George Patton, and played the soundtrack of the movie ``Patton''
starring George C. Scott.
   But Tate said that LaRouche backed Wertz all the way, credited
him for the movement's fund-raising success, and told staffers,
``Wertz reports directly to me.''
   LaRouche and his associates are building their defense with two
cornerstones. They insist that they planned to repay the more than
$30 million in loans they received, but had to divert their money to
defend the movement against attacks from the government and news
media.
   And LaRouche contends he filed no tax returns because he had no
income.
   The co-defendants are Wertz, chief LaRouche legal adviser Edward
Spannaus and four fund-raisers: Michael Billington, Dennis Small,
Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on remembering JFK:
   John F. Kennedy died 25 years ago today, shot down in a motorcade
in Dallas. The nation mourned; it does still.
   In the last few years, it has been fashionable to tarnish
Kennedy's accomplishments; even his reputation has been tainted,
rightly or not. But, for now, let us remember the good of our 35th
president.
   Kennedy personified a young, idealistic America with a mission
not only to improve the lot of Americans but the state of the world.
   He inspired thousands of Americans to take up his call for public
service (``... ask what you can do for your country'') through the
Peace Corps and elsewhere. He began the federal government's major
push on civil rights. He pledged that the United States would have a
man on the moon by the end of the 1960s. ...
   Let us remember these things as we mark this sad anniversary.

   The Journal, Lorain, Ohio, on Christmas cards for Terry Anderson:
   What a noble undertaking, this sending of Christmas cards to
Terry Anderson, who is being held hostage by fanatics somewhere in
the Middle East, probably Lebanon.
   The idea, the essence of the Christmas spirit, originated with
Lorain's Free Terry Anderson Committee. It is intended to share a
little holiday cheer and remind Anderson _ and his captors _ that he
is not forsaken by the folks in his old hometown and Lorain County.
...
   Once received, the cards will be boxed and given to U.S. Rep. Don
Pease, D-Oberlin, who has arranged with the U.S. State Department to
have the cards delivered to Anderson's captors.
   All Christmas cards for Anderson must be received by Dec. 8 to
ensure they reach him by Christmas. The cards should be mailed to:

   San Antonio Express-News on taming the Internal Revenue Service:
   When President Reagan signed Congress' latest tax bill, he gave
life to something new, overdue and welcome: a Taxpayers Bill of
Rights.
   Under the bill of rights, many taxpayers no longer will be hit
with additional taxes or penalties if they relied on erroneous
written advice by the IRS.
   The bill permits the taxpayers to sue the IRS for wrongful
treatment and, if succesful, to collect damages and reimbursement
for legal and accounting fees.
   And, most important, the IRS will have to stop its hated practice
of seizing bank accounts and other property on 10 days' notice. The
notice period is tripled to 30 days.

   Journal-World, Lawrence, Kan., on education cheating:
   Education officials in California have uncovered incidents dating
to 1985 in which school personnel in 45 public elementary schools
changed answers on standardized state tests that measure a school's
progress in reading, writing and mathematics. ...
   State officials said the apparent motive was to raise the
schools' overall score, which could entitle it to more state funds.
...
   We can't be naive enough to believe that California is the only
state where such finagling has occurred.
   How many other areas have had similar situations which have
encouraged the kind of educational mediocrity leading to a growing
number of illiterates and ill-prepared graduates?

   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on the National Rifle Association
vote:
   The National Rifle Association is widely viewed as the original
unstoppable force in U.S. politics, mostly, we suppose, because it
has rarely run into an immovable object.
   At least not until recently, when the Maryland electorate
asserted itself and rejected attempts to repeal a recently enacted
handgun control law.
   Polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans
approve of a form of gun control, including registration.
   Nevertheless, the NRA has had remarkable success in defeating all
but bare minimum regulations.
   Its job has been made easier, of course, by picking up the votes
of lawmakers, especially those who receive NRA campaign
contributions.
   Perhaps the outcome in Maryland will persuade legislators in
other states and on Capitol Hill that a sound, common sense law does
not have to be trashed just because it draws fire from the NRA.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on Skinheads and racism:
   Portland and all of Oregon must speak out fervently and

man recently in Portland.
   The obvious racial motive behind this brutal murder should shock
all fair-minded people. ...
   Witnesses have told police that the killers ... wore clothing

Skinheads. ...
   Skinheads also have been linked to two other slayings nationwide

homosexuals.
   These assaults and other racial incidents around the nation are
occurring in part as a result of the overall racial climate in this
nation. ...
   Our police departments can't control the problem alone.
Individual citizens must enlist in this war against racism and

   The Columbian, Vancouver, Wash., on stock market reaction to the
election:
   Ever since election day, the stock market has been reading bad
news on the lips of George Bush, and prices have jiggled downward.
...
   The president-elect talked flexible freeze and sang ``Don't
Worry, Be Happy,'' to slide past Michael Dukakis. But he never got
around to explaining just how his economic policy would differ from
that which he called voodoo eight years ago and which pushed the
nation to the economic brink. ...
   Bush has promised to make deficit-reduction a high priority, and
he said he will soon meet with congressional leaders to come up with
an acceptable package. ...
   Optimists suppose that Bush and Congress soon will come to a
sudden agreement whereby the new president will offer a selection of
brutal budget cuts at the exact same time that congressional leaders
propose general increase in taxes.
   Realists suppose that neither Bush nor Congress has the will to
do any such thing. Pessimists suppose that the face-off will
continue while the economy slides deeper and deeper into the voodoo
doo doo.

   The News Tribune, Woodbridge, N.J., on Congress' attempt to
regulate commercials during children's television programming:
   Congress ... recently voted to limit commercials on programs
aimed at children. Ads _ most of which promote toys _ would have
been limited to 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per
hour during the week.
   President Reagan, basing his decision on the free speech
provision of the First Amendment, vetoed the bill. Congress vowed to
send a tougher bill to President Bush next year.
   As much as we appreciate the intent of Congress, ... we agree
with the president. ...
   The ban on cigarette advertising ... was based on objective
evidence that even an occasional smoke is a health hazard. But the
notion that a certain amount of toy advertising is better than any
other amount is subjective and selective and would set an unhealthy
precedent.
   Let's leave control of this part of a child's life where it

inclusion of the death penalty for drug-related murders is just one
example of the law's overkill.
   The law does create a Cabinet-level drug ``czar'' (provisions

one-fifth of the $2.6 billion needed to pay for the programs it

   Worthington (Minn.) Daily Globe on child care:
   One of the once-burning issues of the now-burned-out presidential
campaign was the need for affordable child care options for working
mothers.
   Democratic and Republican candidates proposed plans to help the
women of America return to the workforce after time off to have a
baby. But it appears a comprehensive federal child care act is far
from reality.
   Republicans claim Democratic proposals are too expensive.
Democrats claim Republican proposals reach too few.
   Of course, now that the election is over, the burning need for
child care has flamed out on Capitol Hill. With the increasing
concern over the burgeoning federal deficit, nearly everyone in
Washington agrees finding dollars to pay for any type of child care
program will be difficult.
   For 1.5 million women who stay home because they cannot find
adequate, affordable child care, the issue still burns like 1,000
points of light.

   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on the Reagan-Thatcher meeting:
   They were the international odd couple. She the brilliant
workaholic who always seems to know more than any of the
``experts''; he a friendly, avuncular guy who often leads with his
heart instead of his head.
   Yet Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan
were kindred spirits, both fighting the good fight for democracy and
prosperity.
   Last week, as the visiting prime minister said farewell to the
president before he leaves office, they couldn't seem to compliment
each other enough. ...
   But all this self-congratulation and warm talk is distorting
what's happening around the world.
   In the Soviet Union, for example, the man who we can do business
with, seems to be less eager to play at democratizing these days and
more interested in consolidating and fortifying his power. Likewise
the warm winds of change in China have turned a bit chilly this
season.
   Ron and Maggie certainly have had an influence on the world, but
this globe is far too complex a place to believe two Westerners
alone can change the face of it.

   The Register-Herald, Beckley, W.Va., on the collapse of one of

   It may be weeks before the cause of the collapse (Nov. 15) of one
of the world's largest radiotelescopes at the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank (W.Va.) is known, but taxpayers
should pay heed to the immediate comments of one of the
observatory's officials.
   Surveying the vast crushed pile of metal plates and girders ...,
assistant observatory director George Seielstad criticized the
design and materials used to construct the 300-foot-diameter dish
some 26 years ago.
   Noting the dish was originally supposed to be 140 feet in
diameter, but was allegedly expanded without changes in its design
or materials, Seielstad told reporters the collapse ``was the price
you paid to do something fast and cheap.''
   It's comforting to know that even the ``experts'' can make
mistakes, but before these astronomers build a new radiotelescope,
we suggest they get their heads out of the clouds.

   The Milwaukee Journal on education for workfare recipients:
   Across Wisconsin hundreds of women on welfare attend college,
generally the surest route to self-sufficiency in the nation.
   Yet, the state's workfare program in effect expects them to drop
out and either get a full-time job or enroll in a job-training
program. ...
   Just (recently) came news of a two-year study concluding that
young Americans who do not attend college have a high chance of
facing dead-end jobs with poverty level pay or no jobs at all.
   Yet, according to testimony before a state legislative committee,
welfare officials advised one single parent to quit the University
of Wisconsin-Parkside, where she is a freshman, and learn auto
mechanics. ...
   This rule is completely upside down. Workfare ought to encourage
college attendance. ...
   Sure, officials should monitor attendance closely to make sure
that welfare recipients are genuinely working toward degrees. But
punishing them for going to college is an inanity begging for a
legislative remedy.

   Troops bombarding a suspected
communist rebel hideout in the southern Philippines accidentally
killed a family of six when an artillery shell hit a hut, a military
official said Wednesday.
   Col. Rogelio Villanueva, army regional commander, said the
incident occured Sunday in the village of Maritula, about 525 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Before the accident, government troops on patrol clashed with a
group of Communist New People's Army guerrillas near Maritula,
Villanueva said. After a 30-minute firefight, the rebels fled to
different directions with most of them running toward Maritula.
   The soldiers radioed for artillery fire after pinpointing where
the rebels had hidden, he said. One of five rounds from a 105mm
Howitzer cannon landed in the house, killing the family. The rebels
escaped, he added.
   Villanueva said he had ordered an investigation into the accident.

   The Dorchester, one of London's grandest hotels,
has been fined about $11,900 for violating health and safety
regulations.
   Prosecutor Geoffrey Stevenson told Bow Street Magistrates Court
on Tuesday that health officers in March found part of the hotel's
main kitchen infested with cockroaches.
   The Sultan of Brunei, one of the world's richest men, paid $55.9
million for the 280-bedroom hotel on swank Park Lane in 1985.
   The 57-year-old hotel was headquarters for Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower, the Allied Supreme Commander in World War II.
   On behalf of the hotel, lawyer Patrick Hamlin pleaded guilty to
17 counts of infringing food and hygiene regulations and one count
under safety regulations charging the kitchen floor was slippery
with grease and very dangerous.
   Stevenson said kitchen ceilings, walls, an open gully and cooking
equipment were covered in grease.
   Since the inspection, the hotel has spent $170,190 improving the
kitchen, Hamlin said.
   An average single room at the Dorchester costs $219 a night and
dinner for one about $54.

   The mayor has asked the state to review
the Police Department's investigation of a landlady accused of
killing her elderly tenants and burying seven bodies in the yard of
her Victorian boardinghouse.
   After finding the first body and interviewing Dorothea Montalvo
Puente, 59, police released her, citing a lack of evidence. She was
arrested five days later in Los Angeles following a search in
California, Nevada and Mexico.
   Officers then flew her back to Sacramento aboard a plane
chartered by a TV station, which interviewed her en route.
   ``I want to see if any of our policies or procedures need to be
tightened up,'' Mayor Anne Rudin said Tuesday. ``There are obviously
some gaps, especially the two major gaps.''
   Police Chief John Kearns agreed to the review by the state
Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training.
   ``I think it's a positive step, not a negative one. ... We are a
public agency open to scrutiny,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Sacramento County Coroner Charles Simmons said one of
the seven bodies was that of a woman, 50 to 60 years old, and was
the only one found on the grounds of the boardinghouse that
sustained ``obvious physical trauma.''
   ``It was missing the feet and hands and head,'' Simmons said.
``We don't know if the mutilation occurred before or after death.''
   Puente, who ran the two-story home, has been charged with one
count of murder in the death of Alvaro ``Bert'' Montoya, a mentally
handicapped transient and former tenant missing for months from
Puente's home.
   Prosecutors were considering additional counts, said police
spokesman Sgt. Bob Burns. She has denied the murder charge.
   Simmons, who announced that his office has completed autopsies on
the seven bodies, said none of the victims matched Montoya's
description.
   ``But some of them were very decomposed,'' he said. Only one of
the bodies has been identified and the cause of their deaths is
unknown.
   James Beede, a toxicologist with the coroner's office, said
authorities were hunting for evidence of poison as a cause of death,
but declined to provide specifics.
   Police believe the victims were tenants of the boardinghouse and
may have been killed for their Social Security benefits.
   The sole body identified is that of 55-year-old Benjamin Fink,
described by his family as a chronic alcoholic and transient who
moved into Puente's home earlier this year.
   According to documents filed in municipal court, another boarder
told police that Fink disappeared after he became drunk and
``Dorothea told him that she would take him upstairs and make him
feel better.''

   The number of poor people in the
European Economic Community has grown to 44 million, or 14 percent
of its population, the EEC Commission reported Wednesday.
   The people it considers poor earn less than half the average per
capita income of the 12 countries in which they live, it said in a
report.
   But it warns the figure of 44 million is imprecise, since poverty
is not just a matter of income. The commission said it lacks enough
data about other factors, such as housing and education, to make a
fair EEC-wide comparison.
   It attributed the increasing number of poor to ``growing
unemployment, under-employment and unstable and underpaid work as
well as the increase in single parent families.''
   In all, the elderly form the largest group among the poor, the
report said.
   In the 1985-89 period, the EEC contributes a modest $35 million
to 91 projects in all EEC nations aimed at alleviating conditions
for the unemployed, single parents, migrants and refugees and urban
poor.

   The vote was 72-50 for Barbot, said Interpol spokesman M.

   Barbot needed 80 votes for a two-thirds majority win. But Thai
Police Director-General Pow Sarasin withdrew his candidacy for the
unsalaried post after the second vote result was announced, Chamorro
said.
   At a news conference, Barbot said priorities for his four-year
term are improving international cooperation, telecommunications and
computerization of Interpol information.
   He succeeds John R. Simpson of the U.S. Secret Service.
   Police chiefs from 122 nations attended Interpol's 57th Annual
General Assembly in Bangkok that ended Wednesday. Interpol has 147
member nations.
   Interpol Secretary-General R. E. Kendall said there were
``considerable improvements'' in international cooperation against
illicit drug trafficking this year. But he said organized crime is
increasing, and ``We are fighting an uphill battle.''

   Thousands of workers returned to
their jobs today at Latin America's largest steel mill, ending a
17-day strike marked by a clash with soldiers that left three
strikers dead and scores injured.
   The workers voted to accept a proposed wage increase and end
their walkout at the state-owned National Steel Co. in Volta Redonda
northwest of Rio, Jose Queiroz, a plant administrator said in a
telephone interview. Soldiers who occupied the plant for two weeks
began to withdraw, he said.
   The union agreed to an 8 percent raise and a bonus of about $50.
Workers also were to receive a 24 percent cost-of-living raise that
was suspended by the government in July, and the plant management
promised to reduce the shift from eight hours to six within 90 days.
   Earlier, the union had demanded a 26 percent wage increase and a
cost-of-living adjustment. Workers make an average salary of about
$40 a week.
   Inflation in Brazil is running at over 1,000 percent, and many
workers get monthly cost-of-living raises. But the government claims
the raises fuel inflation and has tried to restrict them for federal
employees.
   The strike at the National Steel Co. was the bloodiest in a
recent wave of labor protests acoss the country.
   On Nov. 9, 3,000 strikers armed with rocks, steel pipes and
firebombs battled 800 soldierm the Bridge,'' saved the

23, 1956, MTI said.
   ``The monstrous piece that has since been decorating the actor's
garden, who died in 1972, was now sold by his widow,'' MTI said in
the English-language dispatch.
   The right hand from the Stalin statue will be part of an
exhibition next year on Stalinism in Hungary.
   In 1956, Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev gave his ``secret
speech'' to a meeting of the Soviet Communist party Central
Committee, beginning a broad de-Stalinization campaign that led to
the destruction of thousands of Stalin statues and the renaming of
Stalin factories, streets and schools throughout the Soviet Union.
Stalin died in 1953.

<TEXT>
   Renewed violence in western Sudan,
apparently by armed Chadian bandits, has killed more than 133 people
in one week and burned to the ground 37 villages, the state-run
Sudan News Agency reported today.
   SUNA said the incidents occurred last week in the Wadi Saleh area
of Darfur, 450 miles west of the capital, Khartoum.
   Darfur's governor, Tigani Sysi did not specify what caused the
violence, nor who was involved, and only attributed the trouble in
his region to ``foreign intervention and the continuation of the
Chad conflict,'' SUNA said in a report from El Fasher, Darfur's
regional capital.
   Sysi was speaking at a rally attended by Prime Minister Sadek
el-Mahdi.
   Sudanese leaders have complained bitterly of the spillover of the
war between neighboring Libya and Chad.
   The leaders say that soldiers from the two states have sought a
safe haven from the fighting in Sudan and have committed robberies
while in the country.
   Armed robbers have killed more than 3,000 civilians and at least
100 policemen in the region since 1984, according to official
figures.
   SUNA quoted Sisy as saying two tribal chiefs were killed in the
Wadi Saleh incident which he said was ``the work of foreign armed
bandits.
   ``Their aim is to occupy rich fertile lands in Wadi Salem.''
   This is the first reported incidence of violence in at least
three months.
   Until October, 2,000 followers of Acheikh Ibn Omar, a Chadian
rebel leader, were believed to be hiding somewhere in Sudan.
   At the time, Sysi said there were 32 different bandit gangs in
Western Sudan, responsible for most of the armed robberies. Police
have captured from the foreign outlaws Kalashnikov rifles, mortars
and rocket-propelled grenades.
   He had said leaders of four gangs were killed and six other
leaders captured during a crackdown in July. He said seven of 1,000
gangsters held in northern Darfur prisons were convicted of armed
robbery and condemned to death.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi officially declared the
prolonged war with Chad ended in May and resumed diplomatic
relations last month with the Chadian government of Hissene Habre,
formerly his bitter enemy.

   A state appeals court today ordered
Southwest Airlines Co. to pay $460,000 to a 4-year-old severely
burned by spilled soup.
   The girl, Mara Garduque, received second- and third-degree burns
over 11 percent of her body, including the chest and groin, from a
cup of soup put on a tray in front of her by a flight attendant, the
court opinion said.
   It said she spent two weeks in a burn unit, underwent surgery and
will probably need more, and will be scarred for life on her chest
and thighs.
   The appeals court upheld $210,000 in actual damages awarded by a
Travis County jury and reinstated $250,000 in exemplary damages a
judge had disallowed.
   The girl was flying from Austin to Los Angeles when she became
hungry, and her mother asked the flight attendant for food, the
opinion said.
   A jury found Southwest Airlines grossly negligent in serving hot
soup to the girl.

   Medical care during pregnancy helps increase the
birth weights of black babies more than whites and can narrow the
wide gap between the races in the frequency of dangerously
undersized infants, a study concludes.
   The authors of the report suggested paying $100 rewards to every
pregnant woman, regardless of race, who seeks pre-natal care.
   ``We found that among women who received adequate (pre-natal)
care, their risk of giving birth to low birth weight infants was
greatly reduced, but the reduction was greater in blacks than in
whites,'' said Dr. Merton Bernfield of Stanford University,
co-author of the study.
   Blacks have twice the risk of whites of weighing less than 5{
pounds at birth, and this disparity between the races is increasing.
Such small, often premature babies are 40 times more likely than
normal-size infants to die during the first month of life.
   The latest study, directed by Jann L. Murray, a medical student
at the University of California, San Francisco, was published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. It tried to determine
what role pre-natal care can play in reducing low-weight births.
   The researchers reviewed data on more than 31,000 children born
to largely middle-class mothers who belonged to the
Kaiser-Permanente health maintenance organization in California.
   Even though all the women had access to pre-natal care, blacks
used it less extensively than whites. They were also twice as likely
to have low-weight babies.
   The researchers calculated that the difference in the use of
pre-natal care accounted for less than 15 percent of the difference
in the incidence of low birth weight.
   However, they found that the rates of low birth weight decreased
as the level of pre-natal care rose, and increasing levels of care
were linked with a greater reduction among black infants than among
whites.
   Black women who received adequate pre-natal care were four times
less likely than those with inadequate care to have low birth weight
babies. In whites, there was a two-fold difference between these two
groups.
   The researchers suggested $100 incentives for women who seek care
during the first trimester of pregnancy. Such a program would cost
the Kaiser program $4 million annually. But they said this could be
offset by a reduction in the number of low-weight babies, whose care
costs the program $8 million each year.

<HEAD>Hip Fracture Patients More Likely To Be Confined to Nursing Homes</HEAD>

   Elderly people who break their hips are more likely
to be discharged from hospitals before they can walk and forced to
live in nursing homes since Medicare began paying flat fees for
their care, a study says.
   The report, based on the records of one hospital, shows that
hospitalization for hip fractures has been cut by 40 percent since
the start of the new payment system in 1984.
   The findings suggest ``the overall quality of care for these
patients may have deteriorated,'' the researchers wrote.
   Under the new system, Medicare pays flat fees to hospitals for
specific illnesses, no matter how long patients stay. This gives
hospitals an incentive to treat patients more efficiently. However,
critics say it also may pressure them to send patients home before
they are well.
   The new study found that the proportion of hip fracture patients
remaining in nursing homes one year after their hospitalization rose
from 9 percent to 33 percent since the start of the new program.
   This increase ``is alarming and represents the most important
finding of this study,'' wrote Dr. John F. Fitzgerald and colleagues
from Indiana University School of Medicine.
   They said this suggests that since the start of the new payment
system, patients are less likely to recover enough to live on their
own and instead become long-term residents of nursing homes.
   The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, was based on a review of 331 people treated from 1981 to
1986 at a large community hospital in the Midwest. It was not
identified.
   They said that since the start of the new payment system:
   _Hospitalization for hip fractures decreased from 22 days to 13
days.
   _The proportion of patients who could walk at all when discharged
dropped from 56 percent to 40 percent.
   _The distance patients could walk when discharged fell from 93
feet to 38 feet.
   _The proportion discharged directly to nursing homes rose from 38
percent to 60 percent.

   A thief drove off with a station wagon
before he realized that the 10-year-old blind boy in the front seat
was not a teddy bear, police said.
   The boy, identified only as Danny, was waiting for his father to
come out of a drug store Tuesday night when the thief hopped in and
drove away with the car, which had its motor running.
   The suspect told police that when he realized a child was in the
car he drove around for about a half-hour reassuring the boy he
wouldn't hurt him and trying to figure where to drop the boy off.
   The boy was dropped off on a corner, where police found him
unharmed.
   A few minutes later, an officer saw the station wagon and stopped
the driver, who probably will be charged with kidnapping and auto
theft, Capt. Stephen Roscoe said.
   ``The boy was very happy,'' Roscoe said. ``He wasn't excited ...
he wasn't scared. He was very relaxed and confident.''

<HEAD>Maine Neighbors Proud of Bush, but Worry About Crowds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This seaside tourist town, described
by George Bush as his family's ``anchor to windward,'' is proud of
the local boy who made good but concerned about the crowds he'll
attract as president.
   ``There are mixed feelings about it. I think it's apprehension
and excitement,'' says Town Manager Jane Duncan, echoing fears that
Kennebunkport's emergence as an internationally recognized dateline
could worsen the traffic jams that already clog the area during the
summer.
   Born in Massachusetts and reared in Connecticut, Bush launched
his business and political careers in Texas and moved on to
Washington as congressman and vice president. But this picturesque
town of 4,500 along the coast of southern Maine is a place his
family has always regarded as home. Bush arrived Wednesday for a
five-day Thanksgiving vacation.
   ``They come up here to relax; they love the area. Mrs. Bush tends
the flowers and he likes to go out in the boat,'' said Robert
Dennis, the chairman of the Republican town committee and Bush's
neighbor across the road.
   Except for the period Bush spent overseas during World War II, he
has returned each year since childhood to vacation at the $3.5
million family compound at Walker's Point, named for his maternal
grandfather.
   In recent years, he has spent about three weeks each summer at
Kennebunkport, relaxing on the golf course or tennis court or
fishing for bluefish and mackerel from his speedboat, earning a
reputation for operating the 28-foot craft at breakneck speeds.
   It remains to be seen how much time Bush will spend over the next
four years in Kennebunkport, a Republican stronghold which supported
him over Michael Dukakis on Election Day by a vote of 1,584 to 580.
   Bush, whose family roots here go back to the turn of the century,
has remained a familiar figure on the local scene, attending church
in town, addressing Memorial Day ceremonies and speaking at the high
school commencement. He and his wife occasionally shop in Dock
Square stores or patronize local restaurants.
   Tourists have been coming to Kennebunkport and neighboring towns
for more than a century, drawn by sandy beaches and by the stark
beauty of the surf pounding against rocks along other stretches of
the coast.
   Home to a fleet of fishing draggers and lobster boats,
Kennebunkport has experienced its biggest growth during the past
decade, when commercial development and housing subdivisions kicked
off a real estate boom that sent prices soaring.
   This year, Bush's presence is proclaimed on some of the
best-selling T-shirts being sold in downtown shops.
   One shirt, emblazoned with ``Head to the Beaches of Bush'' and
``Kennebunkport,'' features a caricature of Bush wearing sunglasses
and a tanktop swim suit as he lounges on a beach chair wit a drink
in his hand.
   ``I think it was probably our most popular design,'' said John
Fay, whose Atlantic Screen Print Co. is putting out a winter version
that shows Bush on cross-country skis.
   As vice president, Bush has sought to minimize any disruptions
caused by his presence, while townspeople have respected his privacy.
   ``I don't want to inconvenience our neighbors. I don't want to do
anything to change the charm of this place that has been our anchor
to windward for so many years,'' Bush told reporters in
Kennebunkport earlier this year.
   When asked whether security considerations may prompt Secret
Service agents to drive lobster fishermen from the horseshoe-shaped
cove outside the compound, Bush said he would stay away from his
beloved retreat before he would allow such a restriction.
   Opinions vary on the impact of Bush's future presence on the
town, whose most famous residents up to now include novelists
Kenneth Roberts, known for his historical sagas, and Booth
Tarkington, creator of the ``Penrod'' series.
   Tom Haydock, like many other merchants, sees little change in the
offing, saying that Dock Square is so overrun with tourists there is
no way traffic snarls and parking problems could get much worse.
   ``I think it's great that a hometown boy is going to become
president. We still think of George as a local boy,'' said Haydock,
proprietor of a handicrafts shop.
   Attracting more tourists during the spring and fall would be
applauded by operators of the upscale clothing and jewelry shops
that fan out from the downtown section.
   However, Town Clerk Charles Gould says, ``Merchants have promoted
the town beyond its capacity to handle it.'' Besides the likelihood
of additional tourist traffic, he talks of having to line up
accommodations for a sizable White House staff and press corps.
   Susan Savell, executive director of the local chamber of
commerce, says she's confident the town can handle the additional
traffic, but must adopt ``creative solutions'' that could include
shuttle buses or a trolley system.

   Courteney Cox says she's itching to earn a
bad-girl image after wrapping up the final season of ``Family Ties.''
   ``I don't feel like the sweet little girls I play,'' Cox, 24,
said in the December issue of Self magazine.
   ``If anything, I'm a little too old for my age,'' she said. ``I
started working when I was young, I lived on my own, I dated an
older man.''
   When ``Family Ties'' ends after its seventh season, Cox, who
plays Michael J. Fox's girlfriend, will hardly be misty-eyed.
   ``Everyone's ready to move on,'' she said. ``They've written just
about everything you can write about a family.''
   Now, Cox wants to play complex characters.
   ``I'm kind of itching to do a very real drama, something like
``'night, Mother,'' or a romantic lead. I always play the
intellectual, never the sexy or the bad girl.
   ``I don't know if they're going to let Courteney Cox of `Family
Ties' or `Cocoon' play someone with a drug addiction. But I'm
ambitious. I like to get things done and I want to do it now. I'm
very determined,'' she said.

<HEAD>Study Says Even Elderly Benefit from Giving Up Cigarettes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   You're never too old to quit smoking, say
researchers who found that even people in their 70s significantly
reduce their risk of heart attack and death when they kick the habit.
   Their study disputes the notion that old people have already
suffered too much damage from smoking to benefit from quitting.
   They found that over six years, the death rate of older folks who
continued to smoke was 70 percent higher than that of people who had
recently quit.
   The study was based on people who already had clogged heart
arteries, a condition that affects an estimated 3.9 million
Americans over age 54. Other research is under way to see if older
people with healthy hearts also live longer if they stop smoking.
   ``The message is that it's never too late to quit,'' said Bonnie
Hermanson. ``Older people with heart disease have just as much
benefit from quitting as younger people do.''
   The study, conducted by Hermanson and colleagues from the
University of Washington and the Mayo Clinic, was published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. It was based on men and
women over age 54 who took part in the Coronary Artery Surgery
Study, or CASS, a major review of coronary bypass surgery.
   Cigarette smoking is considered to be the chief avoidable cause
of death in the United States. According to the national Centers for
Disease Control, smoking was responsible for 320,515 deaths in 1984.
About one-third of them were smoking-related fatal heart attacks,
strokes and cardiac arrest.
   ``There is some feeling that it's too late for older people to
quit, because they have had too much damage over the years,'' said
Hermanson. However, ``there is very little data dealing with elderly
people. Most smoking studies are done on those who are middle aged
or younger.''
   Dr. John H. Holbrook of the University of Utah said the new study
shows the advantage of quitting in people whose heart disease has
been carefully documented.
   ``No matter how old you are, no matter how long you've smoked,
there's a benefit to quitting,'' he said. ``And as far as heart
attack is concerned, the benefits begin to accrue within a few
months.''
   The risk of lung cancer, another major hazard of smoking, also
drops when people stop smoking, although the reduction is not as
fast as the fall in heart attacks.
   The latest study was based on a comparison of 807 people who had
quit smoking within the previous year and 1,086 people who continued
to smoke. During six years of follow-up, 210 of the quitters and 391
of the continuing smokers died.
   The differences cannot be blamed on more severe heart disease
among those who continued to smoke. In fact, the quitters were
actually sicker than the smokers, the researchers said.
   Dr. Bernard J. Gersh, a co-author of the study at the Mayo
Clinic, said the lower death rate among the quitters resulted
largely from fewer heart attacks.
   Among the study's conclusions:
   _ After the researchers adjusted their findings for severity of
heart disease, those who continued to smoke had a 70 percent higher
risk of death.
   _ Thirty-eight percent of the smokers died during the six-year
period, compared with 28 percent of the quitters.
   _ Among those over age 70, 50 percent of the quitters died during
the follow-up, compared with 68 percent of the smokers.
   _ The greatest difference in survival was among those with
moderate degrees of heart disease.
   _ The benefits of quitting were similar for men and for women.
   _ The advantages of giving up smoking that were seen in older
people were virtually the same as those in middle-age people.
   ``On the basis of these results,'' the researchers wrote, ``we
believe that it is worthwhile for physicians to encourage their
elderly patients with coronary artery disease to quit smoking as
strongly as they do their younger patients.''

<TEXT>
   An official of the county fire marshal's office
falsely claimed to have inspected an Ashland Oil Inc. diesel tank a
year and a half before it collapsed, fouling drinking water in
several states, police said.
   Charles E. Kelly wrote in a May 19, 1986, memo that ``this
inspector performed an on-site inspection'' that day but has since
admitted he did not visit the site, said Richard Winters, Allegheny
County assistant police superintendent.
   Kelly's office was responsible for inspecting the tank at
Ashland's Floreffe terminal that collapsed south of Pittsburgh on
Jan. 2, spilling more than 700,000 gallons of fuel into the
Monongahela River.
   The spill cut off drinking water in West Virginia, Pennsylvania
and Ohio.
   Ashland later admitted it did not obtain the required permit to
erect the tank.
   Former Fire Marshal Martin A. Jacobs on Tuesday admitted lying in
a sworn deposition when he said he didn't know about the existence
of the memo. Jacobs and Kelly resigned Friday at the request of
Police Superintendent Robert G. Kroner.
   The memo was revealed last month by Edward Babyak, deputy fire
marshal. County fire and police officials had previously denied such
a memo existed.
   Babyak also was asked to resign but refused, and was suspended
pending a review of dismissal procedures.

<HEAD>Day of Dolphins: Leo & Nemo Doing Swimmingly After Flight From
Egypt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leo and his ailing partner Nemo _ two performing
dolphins that spent a year in a hotel swimming pool in Cairo _ were
spirited to sanctuary in France early Wednesday, slipping through a
legal net.
   The dolphins were whisked out of Egypt on a special pre-dawn
flight and convalescing in a pool at Marineland Cote d'Azur in
Antibes pending the outcome of a legal decision.
   ``They're in very, very good spirits. They're eating extremely
well, eating high quality herring,'' said Dr. David Taylor, a
veterinarian who accompanied them on the flight out. ``And if all
goes well, I expect each of them to be plump and have double chins
by Christmas.''
   Nemo is suffering from pneumonia, liver trouble and skin
problems, Taylor said in a telephone interview. He has scars under
his ``arm pits'' or flippers from improper transport in the past,
Taylor added.
   Both animals had grown lethargic after a year of swimming in
circles in the pool of Cairo's Meridien Hotel.
   The dolphins were brought to the Meridien a year ago to perform
in the main pool for guests during the winter season. But then they
became stranded.
   The hotel said it could not continue to house the dolphins, but
their owner, the International Dolphin Show Co. headed by Bruno
Lienhardt of Switzerland, has said it had nowhere to take them.
   Meridien Hotel general manager Edouard Speck has said the hotel
is taking the dolphins' owners to court to decide their fate, and a
hearing was scheduled for Sunday in Cairo.
   Speck said Wednesday that four days ago the hotel obtained
permission from the Agriculture Ministry for the dolphins to leave.
   On Wednesday, the hotel was informed of a court injunction
canceling the departure order, ``but meanwhile they were already out
of the country,'' Speck said.
   While the hotel says its dolphin contract expired May 31,
Lienhardt claims the deal runs through May 1989. He said the
Meridien told him in April to get rid of the dolphins so the pool
would be free for summer guests.
   ``I traveled everywhere to find a suitable pool for the
dolphins,'' Lienhardt said from Cairo. ``I couldn't find anything in
one month.''
   Taylor said travel plans for the dolphins on Air France were
changed when he learned of the injunction.
   ``We decided we would have to dissemble,'' Taylor said. ``We
busily found another small, excellent airliner in Egypt.''
   The dolphins were put aboard a Boeing 707 of the Egyptian airline
ZAS at 5 a.m. Two ambulances met the plane in Nice and transported
the animals to nearby Antibes.
   ``It was a very smooth, fast operation,'' Taylor said.
   Lienhardt arrived at the Meridien Tuesday night and ``started
making a lot of noise and shouting about us kidnapping his
dolphins,'' Speck said.
   He doubted the Egyptian government would try to bring the
dolphins back.
   ``It's a fait accompli, and the government knows there is no good
pool for them here,'' Speck said.
   ``What counts at the bottom of the pile is the animals' welfare,
said Taylor, who is a specialist on exotic animals with the
International Zoo Veterinary Group based in Lightwater, outside
London.
   He foresaw a gloomy fate for the dolphins had they not made the
pre-dawn getaway.
   ``While lawyers argued, the animals would have continued to stay
in a place of great risk,'' he said.
   Leo, born in 1979, and Nemo, born in 1980, were trained as
performing dolphins. Lienhardt's company also brought two seals,
Neptune and Luca, to the Meridien a year ago. Luca died from
neglect, according to Speck, and three months ago the hotel got
court approval to transfer Neptune to the Cairo Zoo.
   ``When the dolphins are fit, I may well say, for the first time
in eight years, let them have the experience of females,'' Taylor
said. ``That would be part of their psychological redevelopment.''

<TEXT>
   Family and friends of an AIDS patient charged
with endangering a nurse say he is being persecuted because of his
condition.
   Scott Fleming, 25, of Los Angeles, was experiencing a seizure,
not trying to hurt the nurse, when he struck out at her as she drew
blood from his arm, they said Tuesday. The nurse was stabbed in the
finger with the needle.
   ``We told them he had AIDS so they could take precautions,'' said
Ilsa Andress, who said she telephoned paramedics when Fleming
experienced a seizure at her home last week. ``Instead they're
trying to persecute him because of it.''
   Fleming has been jailed on $50,000 bail on charges of attempted
battery and endangering.
   The nurse at the Milwaukee County Medical Complex in Wauwatosa
was drawing a blood sample when Fleming jerked his arm away, called
her a name and swung at her, the Milwaukee County Sheriff's
Department said.
   Fleming's roommate, Patrick Leyba, said that it was not like
Fleming to be violent but that Fleming could act unusually if he had
one of the seizures he has experienced since childhood.
   ``I can understand the nurse's feelings. But my son has only four
months to live,'' said Ronald Fleming. ``We've already talked with a
funeral director about what we're going to do, and now this
happens.''

<HEAD>Orders for Non-Military Durable Goods Drop for Second Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods,
excluding military equipment, slipped in October for the second
consecutive month, the government said Wednesday, but economists
weren't unduly concerned about the weakness.
   The Commerce Department said total orders, including the biggest
gain in military goods since June, rose 2.4 percent last month to a
seasonally adjusted $122.1 billion.
   However, excluding the defense category, which swings widely from
month to month, orders fell 0.2 percent in October and 2.5 percent
in September.
   Nevertheless, economists weren't overly worried, pointing to the
steady increase in the backlog of unfilled orders, which rose 0.8
percent to $435.7 billion in October after increasing 0.3 percent in
September and 1.2 percent in August.
   ``The backlogs will keep the (manufacturing) sector humming ...
well into next year,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data
Resources Inc., a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. ``The idea
that growth is slowing is correct ... but it certainly doesn't
portend a recession.''
   Other economic indicators, including employment, retail sales,
consumer prices and industrial production, portray a robust, if
somewhat inflationary, economy, in October.
   The report on orders for durable goods, ``big ticket'' items
ranging from bicycles to battleships, is the first hint of softness.
   ``From the point of view of (those worried that the economy is)
overheating, it's a favorable development,'' Ms. Latta said.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business expansion plans, also fell for the second month. It was
down 2.6 percent last month to $34.0 billion, following a 10.2
percent drop in September, the largest since January 1986.
   Capital spending has been one of the strongest sectors of the
economy this year because manufacturers spent heavily to increase
production for booming export markets.
   ``You can see some of the edge coming off the fast rates of
growth in capital spending, but it still remains healthy,'' said
Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers. He said manufacturers in his organization expect
``reasonably good'' business through the first half of 1989.
   The 2.4 percent increase in October orders followed a decline of
2.9 percent in September and a rise of 5.2 percent in August.
   Defense orders totaled $10.4 billion, up 41.1 percent from
September. The department attributed much of the gain to orders for
new ships.
   Transportation equipment, boosted by gains at auto plants as well
as shipbuilding, rose 8.9 percent in October to $34.4 billion,
almost rebounding from a 9.1 percent drop in September.
   Excluding transportation, orders rose a scant 0.1 percent in
October and fell 0.4 percent in September.
   In other categories last month, orders for primary metals
including steel fell 0.6 percent following a 5.9 percent rise.
Orders in the machinery category that includes computers fell 3.6
percent. Electrical machinery was up 1.8 percent.
   Shipments of durable goods rose 0.5 percent last month to $118.7
billion, following a 0.2 percent rise in September.

   A shopowner wounded in a shooting
spree last week has died of his injuries, raising to seven the death
toll from a rampage by an ex-policeman who opened fire randomly at
blacks.
   Abdul Carrim, owner of a jewelry store in central Pretoria, died
Tuesday night, reportedly of heart failure caused by a blood clot.
He was shot in the leg Nov. 16 when he confronted the gunman during
the rampage.
   Six blacks were killed and 17 people injured, all of them black
except Carrim, 52, who was of Indian descent.
   The gunman has been identified as Barend Strydom, 23, who quit
the national police force in February while facing misconduct
charges. He is a member of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a
whites-only paramilitary group.
   The government responded to the rampage by threatening a
crackdown on extreme-right groups. But the leader of the resistance
movement, Eugene TerreBlanche, said at a rally Tuesday night near
Cape Town that his group was too powerful to be banned.
   Strydom is to undergo psychiatric testing pending his Dec. 19
court appearance.

   The father of four children who were stabbed
to death in April had himself arrested Wednesday after stealing
garden hoses and lawn chairs in an effort to meet the children's
killer in jail, police said.
   But police said the father, Ernest Albert Mann, was unaware that
Leo Narvaiz Jr., 20, already had been transferred to death row in
Huntsville.
   Narvaiz was convicted last week of murdering Mann's daughters
Shannon, 17; Jennifer, 19, and Martha, 15, and son Ernesto Jr., 13.
Narvaiz was a former boyfriend of Shannon Mann.
   Mann told police he learned from a news report this week that his
son had been stabbed 67 times.
   ``I want to see (Narvaiz) face-to-face,'' Mann told officers when
he was arrested on a complaint of theft under $20.
   Mann, 36, was arrested after officers received a call about 1:50
a.m. about a man walking along a street picking up items left
outdoors and placing them in his pickup truck.
   An officer stopped a motorist whose truck contained three garden
hoses, five lawn chairs, a lawnmower, three garbage cans, a barbecue
pit, a rake and a garden sprinkler.
   Mann was fined $50 on a charge of theft under $20.
   ``I heard on the radio this morning on my way to work he stabbed
my boy 67 times. He stabbed him 67 times,'' Mann told the night
magistrate as he began weeping.

   Five members of Congress asked President Reagan
on Wednesday to pardon Conan Owen, the Annandale, Va., photographer
freed from a Spanish prison after serving time for what U.S.
officials say was a wrongful drug trafficking conviction.
   Owen, 24, arrived at his suburban Washington home Tuesday night,
on his parents' 27th wedding anniversary, to a boisterous greeting
from neighbors and friends who had festooned the place with balloons
and welcoming signs. Technically, he must remain there under house
arrest until March, when he will be eligible for a U.S. parole.
   ``The tragedy of Conan Owen's story is finally coming to an
end,'' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., who is Owen's congressman.
``This story, however, will not be concluded until Conan's name is
finally cleared _ and that requires a presidential pardon.''
   Parris and four congressional colleagues sent Reagan a letter
asking him to ``grant Mr. Owen a full presidential pardon and, in
accordance with the findings of the Justice Department, establish
his innocence. Your action will help to end a year- and a half-long
nightmare for Mr. Owen and his family.''
   Others signing the letter were Reps. Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky.,
Thomas Carper, D-Del., Bill Nichols, D-Ala., and Trent Lott, R-Miss,
a senator-elect.
   In Annandale, Owen said ``It was really great to see all those
familiar faces, all the familiar sights. It's a great relief.'' He
said he plans to write a book about his experiences.
   ``I'm going to give it a try, try to write it out,'' said the
congenial Owen. ``It can't be too hard _ after all, Donald Trump
wrote one.''
   Owen was convicted in Barcelona last April of carrying four
pounds of cocaine from Chile into Spain beneath the false bottom of
a suitcase. He was on a free-lance photo assignment for a travel
brochure.
   The young photographer steadfastly maintained that he was unaware
the drugs were there, and the man who arranged the assignment, Jorge
Barahona of Washington, later admitted in a U.S. court that he had
planted the drugs in the suitcase without Owen's knowledge.
Then-Attorney General Edwin Meese presented Barahona's confession to
Spanish authorities, as well as other evidence he said established
Owen's innocence, but to no avail.
   After spending 19 months in a Spanish jail, Owen was transferred
to a Loretto, Pa., prison Nov. 8 under terms of a treaty that
provides for the transfer of prisoners between the U.S. and Spain
when a citizen of one country is convicted of a crime in another.
   Federal prison officials on Tuesday released Owen for a holiday
furlough. Meanwhile, a plan approved by U.S. Parole Commission
allows Owen to serve the remaining months of his sentence at home
under the custody of his parents, Ernest and Raquel Owen. He will be
eligible for parole in March.
   ``I was always afraid it was only going to be a dream, but it's
true,'' Raquel Owen said of her son's homecoming. ``It's marvelous.
I woke up this morning, and there he was reading the newspaper.''
   On Monday, Owen will report to the Fairfax County Home Detention
Program to be fitted with an electronic device that will monitor his
whereabouts during his period of house arrest. The program is likely
to be quite flexible, allowing for outside employment and recreation
time, authorities said.
   ``Everything we've heard indicates there will be very little
problem,'' said Lt. James Vickery, spokesman for the Fairfax County
Sheriff's Department. ``The Federal Bureau of Prisons will set the
standards, but we don't think there will be employment checks or
unplanned home visits.''
   Owen, a 1986 honors graduate of Syracuse University, formerly
worked as a summer intern in Vice President George Bush's office and
had been admitted to the U.S. Army Intelligence School in Fort
Huachuca, Ariz.
   The parole commission said Tuesday that Owen's role in bringing
cocaine into Spain was ``peripheral'' _ a courier with ``no
managerial or proprietary interest'' _ and reduced his minimum
prison sentence from 40 months to 24 months. A parole hearing is
scheduled for March 12.

   The government plans to legislate against
extra-marital sex and seduction of minors by adults as a part of its
campaign to curb the spread of AIDS, it was reported Wednesday.
   ``Those adults who engage in illegitimate extra-marital sexual
relationships could also be punished, provided that we carry out
some other adjustments in the law,'' the state-owned New Vision
newspaper quoted President Yoweri Museveni as saying.
   He spoke Tuesday at the opening session of a national seminar on
United Nations Draft Convention on the Rights of the Child.
   Museveni also said he had suggested the National AIDS Control
Committee introduce legislation to protect anyone under the age of
21 from contracting the disease through sex abuse by adults.
   ``We should make it a severely punishable crime for any adult to
seduce into illegitimate sexual activities anyoby below 21,''
Museveni said, according to the New Vision.
   He said minors also should not engage in illegitimate sexual
relationships.
   ``If they want sex, they should get married,'' Museveni said.
   Uganda has reported 5,000 AIDS cases, according to the National
Aids Control Committee.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   The body of Greek heiress
Christina Onassis was put on a flight to Greece today after a judge
ruled that an exhumation would not be necessary to determine the
cause of death, the judge's aides said.
   Federal Judge Alberto Piotti authorized release of the body about
2 p.m. as a group of Ms. Onassis' family and friends waited with the
casket at Ezeiza International Airport.
   Aides to Piotti said authorization was granted because forensic
experts said autopsy evidence was sufficient to determine the cause
of death.
   Ms. Onassis' housekeeper, Heleni Syros, was required to stay
behind to help in the investigation of the death. Ms. Syros
apparently was the first to discover Ms. Onassis' body Saturday.
   The private news agency Diarios y Noticias said judges gave final
authorization after Interior Minister Enrique Nosiglia said delaying
the process might cause diplomatic problems.
   Ms. Onassis' body was put on a Swissair jet to be flown to
Switzerland and then Greece for burial on the island of Skorpios in
the Ionian Sea.
   A preliminary coroner's report said the cause of death was acute
pulmonary edema, or buildup of fluid in her lungs. It did not say
what caused the accumulation of fluid.
   The director of Clinica del Sol Hospital, which initially
received the body, said Ms. Onassis, 37, apparently suffered a heart
attack. But forensic experts and police investigators have worked
since an autopsy was conducted last Saturday afternoon to determine
the exact cause.
   The complete coroner's report is expected in about two weeks, the
newspaper La Nacion reported this morning. It is expected to clear
up details such as precisely where Ms. Onassis died and at what
time, uncertainties that raised questions about whether she died of
natural causes.
   On Tuesday, Federal Judge Albert Piotti said he would allow the
release of the body before final results were in hand if medical
examiners told him they had enough material to establish the cause
of death.
   ``We don't intend to impose bureaucratic obstacles to the
delivery of the body (to relatives), but beforehand we must rule out
any possibility of homicide or suicide,'' said Piotti, who gave an
order barring delivery of the body without his authorization.
   ``We're not going to deliver the body until we are certain an
exhumation won't be necessary,'' Piotti said in an interview with
Radio Continental.
   Diarios and Noticias did not name the judges that it said
permitted the body to leave the country.
   La Nacion said the first doctor on the scene at Tortuguitas
Country Club, 25 miles north of Buenos Aires, told police Ms.
Onassis was dead when he arrived and that her body apparently was
dragged from one room to another.
   It said Dr. Arturo Granadillo Fuentes told police he found Ms.
Onassis lying naked on the floor in a hallway, covered only by a
towel. A check of her eyes, pulse and temperature showed she had
been dead for at least an hour, he was quoted as saying.
   When he attempted to question people in the room who apparently
were speaking Greek among themselves, he was ordered to leave the
premises, La Nacion quoted Granadillo as saying.
   Ms. Onassis inherited a fortune estimated at $500 million from
her father, Aristotle, a shipping tycoon who married Jackie Kennedy
and who died in 1975. She is to be buried in a mausoleum on the
family-owned island next to her father and brother Alexander.

<HEAD>Farmers Face Fines For Hiring Aliens Beginning Dec. 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Farm Bureau Federation says it
fears federal agents are waiting with ``bated breath'' to corral
farmers who hire undocumented aliens when immigration sanctions
against employers take effect Dec. 1.
   But a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service
says those worries are unfounded and that the agency will be
evenhanded in enforcing the employer sanctions against farmers.
   Nevertheless, a labor specialist at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture acknowledged that some farmers are afraid of an INS
crackdown.
   Most employers, including farmers of non-perishable crops, dairy
farmers and cattlemen, have been barred from hiring undocumented
workers since June 1987, and have been subject to fines on the first
offense since this past June. But perishable-crop farmers won a
reprieve from full sanctions until Dec. 1 under the 1986 Immigration
Reform and Control Act.
   On the eve of the sanctions, officials of the American Farm
Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, say they believe the
decks are now clear for the INS to target agriculture. They also
complain the law is tightening up the farm labor market, which could
lead to shortages come next year's harvests.
   ``Any farmer starting Dec. 1 who knowingly hires an undocumented
worker ought to have his head examined because he's more than likely
to get caught,'' said Chuck Fields, an assistant director of
national affairs for the American Farm Bureau.
   ``The INS is waiting with bated breath to get some farmers.
They're waiting in line to pounce on the farmers and we're warning
farmers that they should not take the risk of employing anyone
illegally,'' Fields said.
   Fields said the INS fought giving farmers the extra time, but
``we beat their hides on that and they never liked that.''
   Texas Farm Bureau spokesman Vernie Glasson said the INS, with its
ranks boosted by the legislation, is obligated to carry out the law
``and I fully expect they'll carry it out to their fullest.''
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis said the agency has no reason to treat
farmers any differently than other businesses and ``our approach to
employer sanctions is a very reasonable one. We're not interested in
collecting fines, we're interested in compliance.''
   Al French, labor specialist at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, said emotions among farmers range from fear to
complacency. Some, he said, believe it will be impossible to enforce
the regulations.
   ``We can expect constant, steady enforcement activity on the part
of the INS,'' French said.
   French said it is too early to tell whether farmers will face
labor shortages because of the law, which included a provision that
allowed aliens who had worked in perisable U.S. agriculture to seek
amnesty through Nov. 30. Under the special agricultural worker (SAW)
program, the INS said more than 1 million aliens have sought
amnesty. But it is unknown how many will continue to work in the
fields and how many will seek other jobs.
   French said early indicators of whether there will be shortages
will come during December vegetable harvests in Southern California
and Florida.
   Fields said his organization expects to see ``more and more
shortages developing in more and more places. Americans won't do
this work, they just won't do it. It's seasonal, and there's no
future in these jobs.''
   Glasson said there could be crucial labor shortages for the dairy
industry in Northeast Texas and spot shortages in livestock
statewide.

   President P.W. Botha today
commuted the death sentences of the Sharpeville Six, the Justice
Ministry said. The sentences for the group of blacks had provoked
worldwide protests.
   The Sharpeville Six, five men and a women, will serve prison
terms ranging from 18 to 25 years, the ministry said.
   Botha also commuted the death sentences of four white policemen
and three black men, all of whom had been sentenced to hang for
murder. They were given prison terms ranging from 15 to 25 years.
   Two of the policemen were convicted of killing a township youth
in the Eastern Cape province after severely beating him. The other
two were convicted of carrying out hired killings of two suspected
drug dealers in the Soweto township outside Johannesburg.
   The president's decision on the Sharpeville Six came hours after
the Appeal Court in Bloemfontein, the nation's highest court,
unanimously rejected an appeal to reopen the trial of the
Sharpeville Six.
   The Justice Ministry gave no reason for Botha's decision, and
Jack Viviers, a spokesman for Botha, refused comment.
   Botha previously had turned down a clemency request, but said he
would reconsider the matter ``as a human being'' once the judicial
process was completed.
   The Sharpeville Six were convicted of murder in connection with
the September 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor in
Sharpeville, a township south of Johannesburg.
   No evidence was presented that the six contributed physically to
the death of the councilor, Kuzwayo Dlamini. Instead, they were
convicted under the doctrine of common purpose, which held them
responsible because they allegedly were active participants in the
mob that killed Dlamini in riots caused by a rent increase.
   Anti-apartheid groups in South Africa, international human rights
organizations and numerous foreign governments have urged Botha to
grant clemency.
   Appeals for clemency for the six have come from, among others,
the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain and most other European
countries, and the United Nations. Virtually all prominent
anti-apartheid and liberal leaders in South Africa have urged
clemency, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   Before the reprieve was announced, Prakash Diar, lawyer for the
six, the Appeal Court decision was ``a bit disappointing'' but not
unexpected. He said a clemency petition would be submitted to Botha
within a few weeks.
   Defense lawyers had asked that the trial be reopened to hear
evidence from a state witness who said police coerced him into
giving false testimony against two defendants.
   In today's unanimous ruling, a five-judge panel of the appeal
court rejected the application. The panel said the trial judge,
Willem Human, acted properly and at no time was presented with an
affidavit by the witness asserting that he had given false evidence.
   Shortly before the Appeal Court heard oral arguments in
September, Botha told a television interviewer: ``I cannot interfere
with the judicial system in South Africa unless it is completed, and
only when it is completed will I, as a human being, deal with this
matter on merit.''
   Some of Botha's critics have accused him of hypocrisy, noting
that he ordered a halt to prosecution of South African soldiers
about to go on trial for murder in South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   The Sharpeville Six are Francis Mokgesi, 31; Reid Mokoena, 24;
Oupa Moses Diniso, 32; Duma Joshua Khumlao, 28; Reginald Sefatsa,
32, and Theresa Ramashamola, 27.
   Violence against black officials who cooperate with the white-led
government's segregated political structures is considered by many
blacks to be a consequence of apartheid.
   The Sharpeville Six were convicted of murder in 1985 and have
spent 1,076 days on Death Row.
   The riots in Sharpeville and neighboring townships in September
1984 marked the start of more than two years of nationwide black
unrest.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Political foes of former President Chun
Doo-hwan said Wednesday they want a full investigation of his time
in office, not just his ``insufficient'' apology for corruption and
abuse of power.
   Radical students held campus and street protests after Chun's
televised apology from his home Wednesday morning. About 50 tried to
rush the house armed with firebombs an steel rods.
   The 56-year-old former general, who seized power in 1980 and left
office in February, said he would surrender $24 million and go into
rural exile, a traditional form of penance for Korean leaders.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said he felt Chun was ``personally
sincere'' in the apology but it fell short of public expectations.
He and others said it was not enough.
   On television, Chun said in a grim voice: ``My dear people, I am
really sorry. I have to bear full responsibility for the past seven
years, which is branded by the people as an era of authoritarianism
and misdeeds, although I tried to do my best in my way.''
   Looking tired and strained, he apologized for corruption and and
other scandals and offered to surrender his personal property,
including a $1.4 million house, two golf club memberships and $3.3
million in cash. Chun also said he would return the equivalent of
about $20 million in political funds.
   He and his wife, Lee Soon-ja, left their home after the speech
for rural exile.
   They spent the first day at a remote Buddhist temple in eastern
South Korea. News reports said the couple would stay in a nearby
village for a time, but would have to move periodically because of
threats by radical groups to punish Chun.
   Government sources, not identified, were quoted in newspaper
reports as saying President Roh Tae-woo was expected to issue a
statement soon asking the nation to forgive his predecessor. They
also were quoted as saying Roh wanted to meet with opposition
leaders.
   Kim Dae-jung said the National Assembly should appoint a special
prosecutor to investigate allegations about Chun, his family and
associates. Kim is president of the Party for Peace and Democracy,
the main political opposition.
   He said Chun should appear before investigating committees and
``make public in a manner convincing to the people'' how he acquired
and spent political funds, which Kim said amounted to ``billions of
dollars.''
   Another opposition leader, Kim Young-sam, joined the call for a
special prosecutor. ``The truth must be clearly disclosed regardless
of such an apology,'' he said.
   Contrasting views of Chun's apology came from a young woman who
is an office clerk and an elderly one working as a street vendor.
   ``He looked pitiful and we may forgive him,'' said Kim Un-knyong,
26. ``I think we have done enough and it is good for the nation to
close the case now.''
   The peddler said: ``I hate him. I don't trust whatever he says.
... The figure he is talking about is something astronomical, which
we can only dream of.''
   Some of the 5,000 police ringing the neighborhood of Chun's home
drove the attacking students away. The Chuns already had left.
   About 200 students at Seoul National University fought riot
police for an hour with firebombs and rocks, demanding the former
president be arrested on corruption and othe charges.
   Peaceful street marches were reported in Kwangju and Taejon.
   Chun asked for forgiveness in his television speech, but said he
would accept the people's judgment. He asked to be allowed to remain
in South Korea.
   ``I deeply repent my sins,'' he said. ``I'm ready to face any
sufferings and will not shirk responsibility for the results of my
deeds.''
   He denied sending money out of the country.
   ``I don't have a piece of land or a penny abroad,'' Chun
declared. ``If I have any undeclared wealth abroad, I will take any
punishment.''
   The former president has denied personal corruption, but some of
his relatives and associates have been convicted of or charged with
embezzlement and other crimes.
   He apologized for the dismissal of government officials and
journalists when he seized power, the deaths of opposition
supporters sent to internment camps and the corruption of people
associated with him.
   Chun made a special apology for the bloody suppression of a 1980
uprising in the southern city of Kwangju. About 200 people were
killed and more than 800 injured, by official count, but other
estimates put the casualties much higher.

   Customers can have turkey any day of the
week from mid-March to Christmas Eve at Turkeyville, U.S.A. Any day
except Thanksgiving Day, that is.
   Alan Cornwell, manager of Cornwell's Turkey House, doesn't want
to make his employees work on Thanksgiving.
   The family-run restaurant is the only establishment in what the
unofficial highway sign proclaims as Turkeyville, U.S.A.
   Cornwell started it 20 years ago with his parents, Wayne and
Marjorie, who raised turkeys and sold turkey sandwiches at the
county fair for decades. Now Cornwell has help from his four grown
children and his semiretired parents.
   Every year, 300,000 customers flock to Turkeyville to gobble down
turkey that Cornwell personally prepares.
   ``Turkey is so simple to cook. Of course, I've done it so much,''
said Cornwell, who cooks as many as 15,000 turkeys a year.
   Turkey is the only meat served at the restaurant, but it comes in
everything from turkey hot dogs to turkey chili to turkey ruebens.
   The family got so busy with the restaurant it had to give up
raising its own turkeys in the 1970s. It now buys milk-fed turkeys
raised in Indiana. But 200 birds still strut around for show in warm
weather.
   The peak season is not around Thanksgiving, but in the summer.
But the crowds have never been more than Cornwell could feed.
   ``I've come within five pounds, but I've never run out of
turkey,'' he said.

years ago, when grasshoppers were a major problem. The turkeys did
such a good job removing the grasshoppers from the family garden
that fewer turkeys were bought this year because they've eliminated
most of the grasshoppers.
   ``That's really why we started raising them,'' she said.
   Last year, she said, her husband, Albert, counted 115
grasshoppers in the craw of a turkey while dressing the bird.

<HEAD>Consumers Don't Get Bargain On Home-Grown Thanksgiving Staples</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tar Heel shoppers buying the fixings for
Thanksgiving aren't getting a bargain on turkeys and sweet potatoes,
even though North Carolina leads the nation in their production.
   In North Carolina, it'll cost $30.32 to feed 10 people a
self-basting, 16-pound turkey, stuffing, peas, sweet potatoes,
cranberries, a relish dish, pumpkin pie with whipped cream and
coffee, according to a survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation.
   Of the 14 states surveyed, the cost of the meal in North Carolina
is second only to the District of Columbia, where the meal will cost
$32.25. At $19.95, Texas consumers pay the least.
   ``I don't believe North Carolina is the second-highest place in
the United States to eat a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal,'' Jim
Graham, the state's agriculture commissioner, said Wednesday. ``I've
talked with American Farm Bureau in Chicago and they admit the
survey was not scientific. They simply wanted to sample the states
to get some idea of what was going on costwise.
   ``The Farm Bureau could have hit a store in North Carolina that
was in a high population area and running no specials,'' Graham
said. ``In the low state, Texas, they may have hit the deal of the
century.''
   North Carolina produces 20.1 percent of all the nation's turkeys,
said Ed Woodhouse, executive director of the North Carolina Poultry
Federation. The state also produces about 40 percent of the nation's
yams.

   Border residents who celebrated
Halloween instead of Day of the Dead are putting turkey on the table
Thursday in another example of what some Mexicans call ``cultural
penetration'' from the north.
   And next month Santa Claus and his reindeer, virtually unknown
two decades ago in Mexico, will be seen in the most remote villages.
   The infiltration of the American traditions has raised the ire of
some residents who fear their own culture is eroding.
   Last weekend, a college student stood on a platform in a park
with a bullhorn, exhorting crowds to fight ``cultural penetration.''
   ``Why do we celebrate Halloween instead of Day of the Dead? Why
do we allow ourselves to be shaped this way by the North
Americans?'' he shouted to some murmurs of approval from the crowd.
``We are abandoning our own traditions!''
   Juarez Mayor Jaime Bermudez said American and Mexican traditions
intermingle. ``There's a lot of American influence here, and the
other way around. The only thing that separates us is a river.
   ``Mexican traditions will be kept intact; we're not going to lose
them. And what about the tacos they eat over in El Paso? And the
enchiladas?''
   Even as families stock up on turkey and stuffing, they're not
honoring the pilgrims, Bermudez said.
   ``Plenty of them buy turkey because it's very cheap this time of
year. It's not that they're celebrating the holiday _ they might not
even know its significance.''
   That apparently is true. In a story about possible turkey
shortages, the leading newspaper in Juarez, El Diario, explained
Thanksgiving with a new twist.
   ``Eating turkey on this day is a U.S. tradition that goes back
centuries, to when a large group of immigrant families were on the
point of starving to death. Miraculously, they found a flock of
these birds, which saved their lives.''

   A transport union leader and five
others were arrested Wednesday on the third day of a drivers' strike
that has disrupted one of the country's main forms of land
transportation, police said.
   The drivers of ``jeepneys,'' privately owned passenger vehicles
operated through government franchises, are demanding lower prices
for spare parts and the suspension of a state-ordered reduction in
fares.
   President Corazon Aquino on Tuesday rejected their demands and
instructed police to ``make sure that jeepney drivers who want to
ply their usual routes are not prevented from doing so, and to
protect the passengers.''
   Police said an undetermined number of drivers stayed off the job
in the capital Wednesday, although more came to work than on Monday,
when the strike stranded thousands of commuters in Manila.
   On Monday, service on about 80 percent of the 445 passenger jeep
routes in the capital was disrupted by the strike.
   On Wednesday, reporters said there were fewer jeeps than normal
operating in Manila's central districts of Santa Mesa and Quiapo,
but no serious delays for commuters.
   Reporters in Cebu, the country's second major metropolitan area
about 350 miles southeast of Manila, said jeep drivers were on
strike on several routes in the northern part of the city.
   Schools in Manila were closed Wednesday because of the strike.
   Police said Deogracias Espiritu, secretary-general of a drivers'
association known as PISTON, was arrested before dawn Wednesday. He
was charged with inciting sedition by leading strikers who made
inflammatory remarks in public, such as calls to ``fight the
government to the last.''
   In Manila's Cubao district, strikers urged jeep drivers to join
the walkout. Police reported some jeeps that did not join were
stoned.
   Five striking workers were arrested on charges of harassing
fellow drivers, police added.
   Strikers said 14 other strikers were arrested in Manila's
northern suburbs of Caloocan City and Navotas. Police in the two
suburbs said they had not received any reports of the arrests.
   Union members told reporters Wednesday that their leaders would
meet later at an undisclosed location to decide whether to continue
the strike.
   Strikes are not illegal in the Philippines, but police say those
arrested were harassing non-striking drivers and commuters.
   A presidential decree last week forced the minimum fare to drop
to about 3 cents for a 2{-mile ride, down from the previous official
rate of about 4 cents. The drivers had in fact been charging about 5
cents.
   PISTON is affiliated with the May First Movement, a leftist labor
confederation the military claims is infiltrated by communists. The
group denies the allegation.

<HEAD>Sweden Lightening Burden of Heavy Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavily taxed Swedes will keep more of
their paychecks under the first major tax reform since the welfare
state was created 50 years ago, the finance minister said Wednesday.
   The package, planned for legislation in 1990, would simplify
income tax and close loopholes that have been exploited by the rich
at the expense of the worker, said the minister, Kjell-Olof Feldt.
   The program calls for sharp reductions in income tax, which is 72
percent on the highest tax brackets and some overtime payments. But
it foresees higher revenues from tax on earnings from investments
and profits by limiting deductions.
   Feldt portrayed the reform as a return to the long-held goal of
leveling incomes and redistributing wealth more equally. He said the
tax system had become cumbersome and distorted by a quiltwork of
revisions which shrewd taxpayers had learned to manipulate.
   ``Even though Sweden has higher taxes than most other countries,
a lot of people call Sweden a tax paradise because it is so easy to
evade taxes,'' he said.
   It was the largest tax overhaul since the Social Democrats came
to power in 1932, governing all but six years since then.
   ``The reason the system has begun to rot is that it's been in
existence for too long. It worked well in the beginning,'' Feldt
said.
   But ``a new world with new institutions, new markets and a new
moral when it comes to paying taxes'' had outdated it.
   The plan was applauded by labor and won cautious approval from
business, as the stock market eased upward by 0.6 percent.
   ``Something has to be done. The taxation of capital today is a
joke,'' said Stig Malm, Swedish Trade Union Confederation chief.
   Stock analyst Tommy Cunzelius of Nordbanken bank told The
Associated Press the proposal was welcomed for providing ``a very
strict and easy tax base that you can count on.''
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson said the reform would safeguard
welfare programs that have eliminated poverty and illiteracy in
Sweden.
   Feldt said incomes under $26,600 would be taxed at an average 30
percent. Higher incomes would be taxed progressively, from 45
percent to a maximum of 60 percent.
   Today, an average wage earner grosses about $20,000 and gets to
keep about half of it.
   The smorgasbord of tax rates on capital gains and investment
profits will be abolished and all income will be taxed at a uniform
rate regardless of its source, Feldt said.
   Corporate taxes also will be reduced from 52 percent to about 30
percent. ``That will mean it will become more profitable to invest
and less profitable to try find loopholes,'' Feldt said.
   The reform was to stop widespread tax planning, in which highly
paid accountants worked out loans and investments that their clients
use as tax write-offs.
   Tax planning was starkly illustrated in the case of a Swedish
real estate dealer who spent $14 million for two paintings in New
York last month. A Swedish newspaper said the dealer had reported to
the tax authorities that he had zero income for the two previous
years.

   Irish actor Richard Harris said Wednesday he has
spent three years ``ducking bombs'' from the Irish Republican Army
since launching a personal crusade against its American fund-raisers.
   Harris, 58, said during a High Court libel hearing that he
frequently gets death threats and receives police protection during
his visits to London.
   ``Someone has to make a stand against the IRA,'' Harris said.
``The killing must stop. I've had six threats on my life so far this
year and now they will start again because of what I am saying.''
   Harris has addressed Irish-American audiences in the United
States in a bid to halt financial support for violent causes in
Northern Ireland.
   Harris made his revelations under cross-examination by lawyer
Richard Hartley, who is defending the tabloid Star newspaper against
claims that it libeled Harris.
   Harris said the newspaper falsely implied that he used his own
``half-baked or amateurish'' methods in attempting to cure his son
Jamie's addiction to heroin. He added that he never gave
on-the-record interviews about his private life.
   The lawyer rejoined that Harris gave an interview to a Star
journalist earlier this year in which he discussed, among other
subjects, his family and his views on the IRA.
   During a heated exchange, Harris told the jury, ``I've had
threats from the IRA six times this year and five or six times in
the previous two years. I take them very seriously and the Irish
Embassy has told me to leave London because of them.''
   Harris most recently has been seen on the American stage in a
cross-country revival of the musical ``Camelot.'' His movie
appearances include ``This Sporting Life,'' ``A Man Called Horse''
and ``Cromwell.''

   Former Supremes singer Mary Wilson won repossession
Wednesday of a $350,000 Mercedes-Benz Pullman car eight years after
she dropped it off at a repair shop.
   The car, once owned by John Lennon, was sold by the repair shop
in Basingstoke near London for $3,750 in 1982, two years after Ms.
Wilson and her ex-husband, Pedro Ferrar, left it for repairs.
   High Court Judge Mark Potter ordered car dealer Nicholas Miranda
of St. Louis, Mo., to return the car and pay Ms. Wilson of Glendale,
Calif., undisclosed legal costs.
   In May, the High Court ordered the repair shop to pay Ms. Wilson
and Ferrar $18,800 in damages and an estimated $24,400 in legal
costs.
   When Ms. Wilson left the car at the repair shop, she was in the
middle of divorce proceedings and was about to leave the country.
The car passed through several owners before Miranda bought it in
December 1984.

Wednesday, but she declined to specify how many.
   The 46 year-old Briton, who replaces Lotfi Mansouri in Canada in
January, has worked at Glyndebourne since 1962 and was general

   Police say they will enforce the law no
matter how sticky the problem.
   They're up against liquid plastic shot from a can that's meant to
entertain youngsters, but the City Council wasn't laughing and
decided to ban the yucky stuff.
   ``We have the discretion to enforce the law and we will use it,''
Acting Police Chief Joseph Barry said Tuesday. ``We're not going to
go up to people and say, `This is a Silly String raid.'''
   The council banned the sale and use of Silly String on Monday.
   Silly String became a problem at this year's Labor Day parade
when vendors sold it to young spectators.
   ``Every kid had a can of the stuff,'' Barry said. They sprayed
passing cars, pedestrians, fire trucks and anything else they could
think of, he said.
   ``The Department of Public Works had a horrendous time cleaning
it up,'' he said.
   Violators of the ban face a fine as high as $200.
   Many Marlboro stores stopped selling Silly String after Halloween.
   ``I have to wrestle with my conscience every time I sell it,''
said one vendor, who asked not to be identified. ``It's horrible.''
The runny plastic has no known practical application other than the
amusement of young minds.
   ``The stuff is awesome!'' said Nathan Rossi, 15.
   ``You sit there and spray people when they go by,'' said Rae
Campbell, 15. ``It's great.''

   Talk of a high-tech radar system that
snaps a picture of the license plates of speeding cars and then
allows Connecticut police to send tickets in the mail is just that _
talk, say police.
   Rumors that state police were using the devices in 18 locations
around the state prompted a Waterbury-based insurance agency to send
out hundreds of letters to its clients last month, warning them to
slow down.
   ``It's absolutely not true,'' said Sgt. Robert Slattery, a state
police spokesman. ``If we had that we would publicize it. We don't
sneak up on the public with something like that.''
   Slattery said that although such a device is used in other states
and in Germany, it could not be used in Connecticut.
   ``The way the law was written, the owners aren't responsible for
speeding like they are for evading responsibility,'' Slattery said.
   However, Richard Bozzuto of BSD Insurance in Waterbury, a former
state senator, said he heard from ``a very good source'' that the
radar devices were going to be set up at 18 locations on state roads.
   On Oct. 6, Bozzuto sent 400 to 500 letters to clients warning
them that the devices ``will operate 24 hours at day, take a
photograph of your car and send the infraction notice directly to
your home via U.S. mail.''
   ``We sent it to clients to warn them. Insurance rates are
certainly dependent on driving records,'' Bozzuto said. ``The more
violations and convictions, the higher the rates are.''
   Joseph Santaniello, a state Department of Transportation traffic
engineer, said the department does have monitoring devices in 25
places across the state. The department compiles the data for
federal funding programs under which the average speed for 50
percent of the vehicles must be 55 mph or less.
   Santantiello said the devices are not used as law enforcement
tools.

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto, whose party won the
most parliament seats a week ago, said Wednesday a crisis may result
if the president does not choose her as Pakistan's next prime
minister.
   Ms. Bhutto's followers won 93 seats in the 237-seat National
Assembly in the Nov. 16 election, compared with 55 for the
nine-party Islamic Democratic Alliance, which includes supporters of
the late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   She told a news conference the delay is ``an unfair attempt'' by
the right-wing rivals of her populist Pakistan People's Party ``to
subvert the will of the people.''
   Selecting any other party to form a government ``would be highly
dangerous (and) plunge Pakistan into a deep crisis,'' she said.
   After a two-hour meeting Tuesday with President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan, she quoted him as saying he would make his choice after the
National Assembly chooses a speaker Dec. 5, indicating which party
had the most support.
   At the news conference Wednesday, Ms. Bhutto declared that ``even
a single day is too long'' to wait. She claims to have enough
support in smaller parties to form a majority coalition, but has
offered no evidence of such alliances.
   ``As soon as we're called upon to form the government we will
present proof of our majority,'' said Ms. Bhutto, who would be the
first woman to lead an Islamic nation.
   She accused the alliance of coercion, blackmail and misuse of
public funds, and claimed the purpose of Ishaq Khan's delay is
``simply to give them a longer time to use official money ... to
subvert the will of the people.''
   Alliance leader Nawaz Sharif was chosen by Zia to lead a
provincial caretaker government in populous Punjab. Gen. Zia
dismissed his civilian national government May 29 and established
caretaker administrations at the federal and provincial levels until
the election could be held.
   Zia overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, in 1977 and Bhutto was hanged in 1979 after being convicted
of complicity in a murder conspiracy. Zia was killed in a plane
crash Aug. 17.
   Sharif also met with Ishaq Khan on Tuesday, and insisted he still
has a chance to form a coalition government. His alliance would need
64 seats from smaller parties but Ms. Bhutto could achieve a
majority with only 26.
   Ishaq Khan was reported to have held meetings Wednesday with
leaders of smaller parties, including the ethnic Mohajir Qami
Movement, which represents Moslem refugees from India and won 13
seats. Both Ms. Bhutto and Sharif have been courting the party.

<HEAD>Thousands of Inmates Head Home on Thanksgiving Furloughs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THEASA TUOHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It's business as usual in state prison systems as thousands of
inmates around the nation go home for Thanksgiving. Only a few
states have no furlough provisions, and several are expanding or
adopting such programs.
   ``It's normal business,'' John Perry, spokesman for Vermont's
Department of Corrections, said of prison furloughs. In its inmate
population of 840, about 75 will go home for Thanksgiving.
   Up to 1,000 inmates in North Carolina, 500 in Alabama, 500 in New
York and 300 in Oregon are set to spend Thanksgiving outside prison
walls.
   The numbers are smaller in other systems, but the trend is toward
release despite the presidential-campaign controversy stirred by
President-elect George Bush and, last week, the canceling of
Thanksgiving furloughs for 21 Maryland inmates because of adverse
publicity.
   While some officials concede inmates can abuse such programs,
many insist furloughs are an effective way to relieve prison
overcrowding and prepare inmates for life outside prison. Most
states allow only minimum-security prisoners to leave on furlough,
and many exclude convicted sex offenders.
   During the presidential campaign, Bush repeatedly attacked his
Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, over his
state's furlough program. The Bush campaign often cited the case of
convicted murderer Willie Horton, who raped a woman in Maryland
while on a weekend furlough. The Massachusetts program was changed
in April to make first-degree murderers serving life sentences
ineligible for furloughs.
   Furloughs have ``proven to be productive on a national scale,''
said Tom Powers, who became warden of the North Dakota State
Penitentiary in September. He is allowing 15 prisoners to go home
for Thanksgiving in a new program he calls ``extremely
conservative.''
   The Kansas Department of Correction is developing regulations for
furloughs under a law passed this year.
   In the few states that have no such programs, including Nevada,
California, Illinois and Michigan, prisoners generally are not
allowed out even for family funerals unless they are in handcuffs or
leg irons.
   ``We have no furlough program for anybody to go out overnight.
What we have is emergency releases with inmates in restraints for
funerals, to go to a relative's deathbed or something like that, and
that's it,'' said Nevada Prison Director George Sumner.
   Leo Lalonde, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of
Corrections, said his state has a similar policy. ``We don't have
anything for Thanksgiving or even Christmas. Although we do have the
highest rate of suicide around Christmas.''
   Two states that grant furloughs, Missouri and Arkansas, shy away
from holidays.
   ``We feel like it puts the inmate in a situation where there is
more temptation,'' said David White, Arkansas Correction Department
spokesman.
   ``When the whole society is partying, it's awful hard not to
party yourself,'' said Dale Riley, a spokesman for the Missouri
Department of Corrections and Human Resources, which quit holiday
furloughs three years ago after three prisoners were arrested one
weekend for assault and disorderly conduct. ``We just felt it was
best not to have them out.''
   In North Carolina, prisoners can go home for up to 48 hours in
the custody of a relative, or can get a day off under a community
volunteer program in the custody of someone such as a minister.
   David Guth, a spokesman for the North Carolina Department of
Correction, said he had no figures for Thanksgiving Day, but on Nov.
20, for example, 1,368 prisoners were on home or community release
out of a prison population of 17,916. Rapists and murders are not
automatically excluded, he said, but only those in minimum-security
facilities are eligible for furlough.
   ``Do we furlough people that are in for murder? Yes,'' said James
Flateau, spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services in
New York where 8,177 inmates got furloughs last year. ``Probably a
dozen people convicted of ... murder are furloughed each year.''
   In Alabama, passes are granted ``based on the trustworthiness of
the inmate,'' said Debbie Herbert, a spokeswoman for the Department
of Corrections.
   The furlough program in Louisiana, however, has been suspended
for study because a trusty working in the governor's mansion has
been accused of murder while on a weekend pass in August.
   In Maine, with a prison population of 577, there are 20 inmates
going home for Thanksgiving.
   In the 20 years the program has been in effect, one inmate ran a
roadblock and killed a policeman and another inmate committed a
crime, said Warden Martin Magnusson of the Maine State Prison.
   ``If you have 2,000 successes and you have one that isn't a
success, that's the one you hear about,'' Magnusson said.
   Maryland's Patuxent Institution, a rehabilitative
maximum-security prison, canceled Thanksgiving furloughs this week
for 21 inmates after criticism of furloughs granted to convicted
triple-murderer Robert Daly Angell.
   ``The inmates really protect the program,'' said Ed Ligtenberg,
associate warden at the South Dakota Penitentiary, where 18
minimum-security inmates are going home for Thanksgiving. ``It's
good for the inmates because it gradually reintegrates them to the
outside.''

   Iraq and Iran will free 150 disabled
prisoners of war Thursday, the first batch of prisoners they agreed
to repatriate early this month.
   Diplomatic sources said the exchange was delayed by prisoners on
both sides balking at going back to their respective countries.
   Red Cross officials said a DC-9 plane will fly from Tehran
carrying 110 Iraqi POWs. It will fly back to Tehran with 41 Iranian
POWs.
   The plane hired by the Red Cross will shuttle between Tehran and
Baghdad for 10 days to repatriate up to 1,115 Iraqis and 411
Iranians, all sick or wounded according to a memorandum of
understanding signed by both Iraq and Iran with the Red Cross.
   Red Cross representative Paul Henri Morard told The Associated
Press that all preparations for the exchange have been completed.
Iraq has set up special camps to process the arriving prisoners
before they go home.
   Morard, who arrived from Geneva to supervise the operation, said
the Red Cross finished its medical checks and had identified all the
POWs who will be repatriated.
   He also said that the Red Cross has asked each POW if he wishes
to be repatriated or not in line with the Geneva conventions on the
treatment of POWs. Morard refused to say whether any declined
repatriation, saying those prisoners will be processed last.
   But the diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said some prisoners have asked to leave for an unidentified Western
country. Also some of the Iranian prisoners want to join the
Mujahedeen Khalq, the Iraq-based opposition group that seeks to
overthrow the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the sources
said.
   Morard said the Red Cross has already registered 50,182 Iraqi
POWs and 19,284 Iranians, but the total number of POWs estimated by
both countries is about 100,000.
   He said the Red Cross has repatriated 765 Iraqi sick and wounded
POWs and 613 Iranians since 1981.
   The Red Cross official said the DC-9 will fly the shortest route
between Tehran and Baghdad. Despite the Aug. 20 gulf war cease-fire,
many planes avoided flying directly over the joint border.
   The operation will be supervised by 17 members of the Red Cross
staff in Baghdad and 18 in Tehran. It is being paid for by an
unidentified Western nation.

<HEAD>It's a Tax Deduction, But Where Do You Claim It?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has enacted a new tax deduction with
no place on the tax return to claim it.
   The change affects workers who continue to receive regular
paychecks while serving as jurors and turn their jury pay over to
their employers.
   The jury pay still must be reported as taxable income. But before
the 1986 tax overhaul, a person who itemized deductions could simply
deduct the surrendered jury pay as a miscellaneous expense and be
none the worse. But the 1986 law permits only miscellaneous
deductions that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income.
   That meant that most jurors who were required by employers to
surrender jury pay in return for having their regular paychecks
continue would have to pay tax on income they didn't keep.
   Congress discovered the inequity earlier this year and corrected
it as part of a big miscellaneous tax bill. But by the time
President Reagan signed the bill into law on Nov. 11, the new tax
forms already were being printed _ without any way to account for
the jury-pay problem.
   ``Our tax-forms people are looking at it, but we still aren't
sure how it will be handled,'' IRS spokesman Paul Nirdlinger said
Wednesday, adding that experts feel the provision affects very few
taxpayers.
   The best bet, he said, is that affected taxpayers will be allowed
to write in the surrendered jury pay on Form 1040 line 30.

<HEAD>Harvard-Trained Economist Becomes New Premier</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miklos Nemeth, a Harvard-trained
economist, was chosen Wednesday to head Hungary's Communist
government as it embarks on tough political and economic reforms
likely to include unpopular austerity measures.
   The 40-year-old Nemeth, a member of the ruling Communist Party
Politburo, will be the youngest Hungarian premier since 1956. He was
chosen to succeed Karoly Grosz, who said he would step down to focus
on his position as party chief.
   Nemeth's appointment is to be approved by parliament Thursday.
Approval is expected.
   Announcing the appointment, party Central Committee secretary
Gyoergy Fejti said the government might introduce referendums on
unspecified issues in the next few years.
   Such a reform could give Hungarians a direct voice in
decision-making. The only East bloc country to have attempted such a
move is Poland.
   ``There should be the possibility for citizens to make decisions
directly,'' Fejti told a news conference. He said citizens
themselves could initiate such referendums, but emphasized that
parliament would have the final say on passing any new laws.
   Nemeth, an advocate of market reform who spent a year studying at
Harvard University, will have the task of overseeing extensive
economic and political change.
   He is expected to guide the country into a period of austerity
certain to irritate Hungarians, many of whom have grown accustomed
to driving into neighboring Austria on shopping sprees for Western
goods.
   Before 1990 when a new constitution is to be adopted, parliament
is to pass a series of laws designed to introduce market forces into
the economy and to restructure political institutions.
   Nemeth came to the ruling Politburo with the younger, more
reform-oriented leadership that accompanied Grosz when he replaced
Janos Kadar as party chief in a major reshuffle in May.
   A graduate of Budapest's prestigious Karl Marx University of
Economics and later a lecturer there, Nemeth first entered the upper
echelons of power in June 1987, when he was named secretary for
economics on the Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee.
   Nemeth has warned that neglecting deeper trade ties with the
European Economic Community could hamper the country's development.
   Last month, parliament adopted legislation to ease restrictions
on foreign ownership and joint ventures and further the flow of
foreign capital into Hungary.
   Like Grosz, Nemeth advocates a socialist market-style economy,
blending state ownership with private initiative and substantially
cutting subsidies to loss-making heavy industry.
   In a nine-page article in the November issue of the monthly
Social Review, Nemeth cited as a model for Hungary's future the
example of large U.S. oil corporations leasing gas stations to
family operators.
   In the article, widely seen as an informal program for his
government, Nemeth also praised the McDonalds hamburger chain as an
example of combining large-scale management with individual service
and initiative.
   The premier-designate seems undeterred by the prospect of as many
as 100,000 people unemployed by 1990 if the austerity program is
fully impelemented.
   He may, however, be hampered in implementing reforms both by
conservatives in the Communist Party and by popular discontent.
   Grappling with double-digit inflation, the East bloc's first
personal income tax and a fall in real incomes, Hungarians
increasingly are demanding more say in how their country is run.
   In December, parliament is due to adopt legislation regulating
the establishment of independent groups, associations and unions.
The new laws accept a multiparty system in principle.
   Government leaders say further legislation is necessary to
determine the establishment and function of opposition parties.
Those laws are not expected before 1990.
   Also appointed Wednesday was Politburo member Reszo Nyers, who
was given the newly created post of minister of state for the
economy.
   Nyers' selection completes a comeback in Hungarian politics. The
father of Hungary's pioneering economic reforms in the 1960s, Nyers
was dropped from the Politburo in 1974 when reforms were curbed.

<HEAD>Water Privatization Looms as Gamble for Thatcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cornerstone of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's capitalist revolution faces one of its biggest gambles
yet as the nation's water supply heads for the stock exchange.
   Oil, gas, the telephone service and a host of other industries
nationalized by past Labor Party governments have gone on sale since
he Tories came to office in 1979.
   The sale of English and Welsh water supplies is a bold venture to
be unveiled Thursday in Parliament. It shows the Thatcher
government, far from flagging after nearly 10 years in power, is
pursuing its free market doctrines with undiminished zeal.
   Privatization of water and electricity were highlights of the
1989 legislative program announced Tuesday.
   The water will be ready for sale within a year, and electricity
sometime in 1990.
   Although electricity is by far the larger undertaking, with
expected revenue of $36 billion for the government, it is water that
has attracted the most controversy.
   It is the most basic resource the government has chosen to sell.
Consumer groups worry that prices will rise and that, once subject
to the profit motive, water purity will decline.
   It is risky because water is not generally seen as a growth
industry. Water authorities are $9.4 billion in debt, which the
government may have to write off.
   The Victorian water and drainage infrastructure is crumbling in
many areas and billions are needed for repairs and to bring water up
to the exacting new standards of purity set by the European Economic
Community.
   Privatizations have raised nearly $40 billion for the Treasury
and enabled it to slash taxes and reach its present budget surplus.
   But in the case of water, comments the left-leaning Guardian,
``whether a private sector solution will be able to raise standards,
while trying to extract increasing returns for its shareholders,
remains hugely questionable.''
   No figure has been set on water privatization. Analysts expect it
to raise $9 billion to $12.5 billion for the government.
   The government first unveiled the water sell-off in 1986, but
backed off under fierce opposition from farmers and consumer groups.
   Under revised legislation, the 10 water authorities which supply
three-quarters of the water needs of England and Wales will become
private companies quoted on the stock market.
   Another 29 semi-private companies supplying the remaining quarter
also will be floated on the stock market if they wish. Scotland and
Northern Ireland are governed by separate legislation and are not
included in the project.
   The 10 authorities, presently responsible for all water-related
issues from sewerage to land draining and river management, will
become responsible only for drains and water supply.
   A National Rivers Authority will be set up to take charge of all
other water-related activity, including monitoring purity and
setting prices.
   Judith Rees, a geographer at the London School of Economics who
has written a study of water privatization, estimated in an
interview that the average household water bill, now $180 a year,
would double within a decade.
   Michael Howard, the government minister charged with steering the
200-clause privatization bill through Parliament, says the priced
could go down ``because we shall have all those incentives to higher
efficiency and lower costs which come from private sector
operations.''

   The Melody Bells won't be ringing in the
White House this year.
   The 37-member children's hand-bell choir declined an invitation
to first lady Nancy Reagan's White House Christmas party this week
because the whole group was not invited.
   The White House asked the Melody Bells to limit the choir to 18
or 20 members.
   ``We're saying, `Thank you, but we're not going to do it,''' said
Joe Fox, manager of the choir of children from Vanderburgh and
Warrick counties.
   ``We feel it's an honor to be invited, but we just don't feel
it's going to work out for our group,'' Fox said Tuesday.
   The Melody Bells, who performed in full force at White House
Christmas celebrations in 1982 and 1986, received an invitation last
week to perform at the party for thousands of White House workers
and executive staff members. Sometimes the president and first lady
attend.
   Wendy Toler, an aide to Mrs. Reagan's press office, said White
House invitations have been refused before, but she didn't know how
often.
   About 15 groups are expected to perform at the Christmas party
this year, she said.

appointment''</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brent Scowcroft is a seasoned and pragmatic
Washington insider, having served as national security adviser in
the Ford White House and on the panel appointed by President Reagan
to investigate the Iran-Contra affair.
   President-elect George Bush named Scowcroft on Wednesday as his
national security adviser, a choice that suggests his administration
plans a cautious course in foreign policy. Over the past three
years, the retired Air Force lieutenant general has publicly opposed
some key Reagan initiatives.
   Bush spelled out a low-profile role for Scowcroft, making it
clear that another pragmatist already nominated to his Cabinet,
Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, ``will be the chief
spokesman ... on foreign policy matters.''
   Scowcroft, 63, will serve as ``an honest broker'' Bush said.
``Because of his tremendous experience, obviously he will convey to
me, unvarnished, his own view on policy matters of tremendous
importance.''
   Scowcroft played much the same role for President Ford. He began
his White House career as military assistant to President Nixon in
1972-73, then deputy to national security adviser Henry A. Kissinger
from 1973-75 and national security adviser from 1975-77.
   Before his appointment on Wednesday, Scowcroft was a foreign
policy adviser to the Bush campaign and vice chairman of Kissinger's
consulting firm.
   Scowcroft was born in Ogden, Utah, graduated from West Point in
1947, and rose through the Air Force ranks to lieutenant general. On
the way, he picked up master's and doctoral degrees in international
affairs from Columbia University. A Mormon, he is married and has
one daughter.
   Scowcroft's appointment drew quick praise from Sens. Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
and Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who was chairman when the Republicans
controlled the Senate.
   ``I think it's an excellent appointment,'' said Pell. ``I've
worked with Brent Scowcroft for years and I think he'll do a fine
job.''
   Lugar called Scowcroft ``an extremely able and experienced public
servant whose comprehensive knowledge of defense and arms control
has engendered substantial confidence in Congress throughout the
years.''
   Scowcroft shares Bush's publicly stated caution about moving too
quickly toward arms deals with the Soviets.
   He has taken several stands over the past few years that put him
at odds with Reagan, criticizing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces treaty and urging the administration to use the Star Wars
anti-missile program as a bargaining chip to get the Soviets'
agreement to sharply reduce their arsenal of offensive missiles.
   ``I think it is highly unlikely to expect any far-reaching
reductions or changes in the Soviet system if they have to look over
their shoulder at the unknown prospects of a defense for which they
may need these warheads,'' Scowcroft said in April 1985.
   In September 1987, he criticized another pillar of the
president's foreign policy, saying the United States would derive
little benefit from the INF treaty, which eliminates superpower
ballistic missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles. Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the pact at their Washington
summit last December and the Senate ratified it last spring.
   ``The United States and its NATO partners, since the early 1950s,
have relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to perserve the peace
in Europe,'' Scowcroft said. Eliminating part of the nuclear
deterrent without redressing the Soviet edge in such weapons as
tanks and artillery could undermine the Western alliance, he said, a
position also taken by Kissinger.
   Scowcroft also criticized an offer made by Reagan at the 1986
summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, to eliminate all ballistic missiles
within 10 years, saying: ``His vision, no matter how grand it may
be, is flawed and unrecognizable, at least in one step.''
   On other issues, Scowcroft has said:
   _The War Powers act, passed after the Vietnam war, is ``deeply
flawed'' and ``to the layman ... seems unconstitutional.'' The law
requires congressional approval to keep U.S. troops in a war zone.
   _The United States should emphasize increasing its own exports,
not controlling imports, to end foreign trade imbalance.
   _The Philippine people support keeping U.S. military bases in
their country. He directed a study on the issue for the nonpartisan
Council on Foreign Relations.
   That study was one of several blue-ribbon panels on which
Scowcroft has served.
   Besides his role on the Tower commission that investigated the
Iran-Contra affair, Scowcroft also served on a panel that advised
President Carter on arms control issues and on Reagan-appointed
advisory commissions on military procurement and on basing the MX
missile.

   Rampaging mobs killed three soldiers, injured at
least 126 people and sacked government buildings and trains in the
worst flare-up of ethnic violence in the Soviet south since early
spring, official sources said Wednesday.
   An ``open confrontation'' had developed between the republics of
Azerbaijan and Armenia ``the consequences of which can be
unpredictably tragic,'' according to the official Bakinsky Rabochi
newspaper of Azerbaijan.
   Azerbaijani officials declared a state of emergency in the cities
of Nakichevan, near the Iranian border, and Kirovabad, and
authorities were urgently trying to restore order, said Musa
Mamedov, chief of information for the republic's Foreign Ministry.
   ``Three soldiers were killed, perhaps by stones, perhaps by
sticks,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Official Baku Radio said ``hooligan elements attacked social and
administrative buildings. As a result of the disruption of law and
order, 126 people were wounded in Kirovabad and three military
personnel were killed.''
   It was the first official report of soldiers being killed in the
Caucasus region since violence erupted in February.
   Lives also were in danger in Baku, where crimes and looting was
increasing, said the Baku radio report monitored in London.
   Hundreds of thousands of people were protesting in the streets of
Baku and the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
   Arpenay Popoyan, wife of Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan, said
in a telephone interview from Yerevan that at least 500,000 people
had gathered in the city's Opera Square during the day, and at night
the crowd marched to the Central Committee of the Armenian Communist
Party.
   ``Practically the whole city went out to the square _ all the
adults and the students _ that's the number there were,'' she said.
   The crowd demanded that a session of the Armenian Supreme Soviet
interrupted Tuesday because of the sharp increase in tensions be
reconvened.
   The Supreme Soviet, which in the past backed activists' demands
for annexation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Azerbaijan, had
not yet gotten to that item when its work was interrupted. Mrs.
Popoyan said a general strike in Yerevan would last until the
session was reconvened.
   Popoyan said Armenians decided at a meeting late Tuesday to form
``self-defense squads'' in areas of their republic where
Azerbaijanis live, but there were no reports of violence in Armenia.
   Calls to Baku did not go through Wednesday night.
   Bakinsky Rabochi reported Wednesday that bus travel between the
two republics had been cut off, and that no one was being allowed
into Azerbaijan from Armenia carrying building materials in their
cars.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
said the siuation in Baku was ``difficult,'' and that there had been
casualties in Kirovabad, but he did not elaborate.
   The two republics are in conflict about control over the
predominantly Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan.
Residents have been agitating since February to have it annexed by
Armenia, but Azerbaijan officials and Kremlin leaders have rejected
the demand.
   Instead, Moscow has ordered a comprehensive social and economic
development plan for the area.
   At least 32 people were killed in three days of rioting in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait at the end of February and March that
followed massive protests in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. Armenia
is predominantly Christian and Azerbaijan is predominantly Moslem.
   Azerbaijanis say hundreds of thousands of people took to the
streets beginning five days ago to protest what they say is an
Armenian effort to send settlers to Nagorno-Karabakh to strengthen
the ethnic Armenian majority there.
   They said Armenian settlers were taken last week to the Shusha
area of Nagorno-Karabakh in official trucks and began building
barracks with materials supplied by the Armenian government.
   Bakinsky Rabochi complained that Azerbaijanis in Nagorno-Karabakh
were not being permitted to work and were deprived of food and
medical supplies.
   Armenian activist Hovik Vassilian reported that Kirovabad was
surrounded by Azerbaijanis who were not permitting Armenians to
flee. He said in a telephone interview from the Armenian capital of
Yerevan that calls to the city would not go through.
   Armenian TV showed footage Wednesday night of a train headed for
Armenia that was surrounded and attacked by a mob near Nakhichevan,
Vassilian said.
   Passengers were taken off the train and transported by bus to
Armenia, but the engineers were hurt and ``not a window or door was
left unbroken,'' Vassilian said. The train was damaged Tuesday and
finally arrived in Yerevan on Wednesday, he said.
   Baku radio said there had been injuries in Nakhichevan, as well
as in Kirovabad, but did not say how many.
   It said ``measures are being taken to maintain legality and
safety of citizens'' in Kirovabad and Nakhichevan.
   An editor for the Azerbaijani news agency Azerinform said 100,000
people, mostly students, were in Baku's Lenin Square on Wednesday,
but that their numbers were expected to swell after work.

   Confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed
Ali Hamadi interrupted testimony Wednesday to protest that a tape on
which Arabic-speaking voices threaten to kill hostages was from a
different hijacking.
   The taped exchange between Beirut Airport authorities and
hijackers speaking from a seized plane was used as evidence against
the Lebanese Shiite Moslem accused of murder and air piracy in the
June 1985 hijacking.
   ``I think I recognize now that the last part of the tape concerns
another hijacking that had nothing to do with TWA,'' Hamadi told the
court. He did not say what air piracy he believed the tape referred
to.
   Alen Mousa, the Lebanese who translated the taped conversation
for West German authorities, was testifying when Hamadi interrupted
him. Mousa told the court he could not positively identify any of
the voices as Hamadi's, but said the two men spoke Arabic with
Beirut accents.
   On the tape, which was played for the court, the voices were
heard threatening to kill hostages unless the plane was refueled
immediately.
   One of the hijackers was heard telling the control tower he would
blow up the plane if the demand was not met.
   Hamadi's attorneys made a motion for further examination of the
tape.
   During the 17-day hijacking ordeal, U.S. Navy diver Richard
Stethem was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage aboard TWA
Flight 847, seized en route from Athens to Rome and diverted to
Beirut and Algiers.
   Hamadi has admitted he and an accomplice hijacked the plane, but
he denied killing Stethem. His alleged accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine,
remains at large.
   Earlier Wednesday, a West German police official testified that
Hamadi told West German investigators he was a member of Hezbollah,
a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem organization believed to be holding
foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Bernhard Giese, an FBI investigator who also testified Wednesday,
said Hamadi told interrogators he had often worked under the command
of his older brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, the Beirut security chief
for Hezbollah.
   ``(Mohammed Hamadi) admitted being a member of Hezbollah and said
that he had taken part in many battles in Lebanon,'' Giese told the
court.
   Asked by Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger if he had any comment,
Hamadi said the statement he gave to West German interrogators ``was
made under duress.'' Hamadi has denied in court that he was a member
of Hezbollah.
   Giese told the court, however, that Hamadi made the initial
statement freely.
   ``There was no pressure. The interrogation was made in a relaxed
atmosphere,'' the FBI agent said.
   On Tuesday, Houston businessman Allyn Conwell told the court he
was so ``terrorized that I was virtually immobile'' while on board
the plane. He said he feared the captors planned to shoot him and
other Americans who were taken to hiding places in Beirut.
   Four American servicemen were removed from the plane by members
of Hezbollah, while Conwell's group was taken away by Amal, another
Shiite militia that collaborated with the hijackers.
   ``I was under the impression that Amal absolutely did not approve
of the hijacking and the murder of Stethem,'' Conwell said. ``I
think they acted to the best of their ability in a chaotic
situation.''
   Conwell said members of Amal told him that Hamadi and his
accomplice wanted to ``return all the hostages to the plane and blow
it up.''
   He said Amal officials indicated to him that the two hijackers
were from Hezbollah.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   The University of Pennsylvania Museum, which
closed temporarily last weekend after three thefts including a
19th-century crystal ball worth about $300,000, has reopened.
   The museum, on the Penn campus, reopened Tuesday after officials
took measures to safeguard objects on exhibit.
   Some of the more valuable exhibits were removed from a
``hands-on'' exhibition, and others were placed in Plexiglas cases.
   Besides the crystal ball, a $300 Sri Lankan mask and a statuette
of the Egyptian god of the underworld were stolen. Osiris, the
satutette, was insured for $15,000 but officials said it was worth
probably three times that amount.

   Israel's two chief rabbis on Wednesday
criticized U.S. Jewish groups for making a ``big fuss'' over a
proposed change in the legal definition of who is a Jew.
   At a rare joint news conference, the two Orthodox rabbis stressed
they had no desire to cause a division with adherents of the Reform
and Conservative streams of Judaism which predominate in North
America.
   The proposed ``Who is a Jew'' law would accept only Orthodox
conversions in Israel, and North American Jewish delegates who met
with the rabbis and Israeli leaders this week complained the
proposal causes feelings of anguish among Reform and Conservative
Jews.
   But the chief rabbis argued the changes were designed to affect
only Israel, where virtually all Jews are Orthodox, and would
directly touch only a few non-Orthodox converts who wish to
immigrate to Israel each year.
   ``Because of such a marginal problem they shouldn't have made
such a big fuss,'' said Avraham Shapira, chief rabbi of the
Askhenazim, or European Jews. ``Orthodox, Conservative and Reform,
we are one Jewish people.''
   Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu, who represents Sephardim _ those Jews
from Middle Eastern countries _ called for a halt to public
squabbling over the proposed legislation.
   ``I would like to appeal to all these people and say pleas don't
make problems for the Jewish people,'' he said.
   Eliahu attacked Canadian and U.S. Jews who threatened to curtail
political and financial support for Israel if the changes are
adopted.
   ``Those who give money to the land of Israel are doing themselves
a favor, and I think it's shameful for them to say that for this
reason or that reason they will or will not contribute,'' said
Eliahu.
   Israeli officials said they feared passage of the ``Who is a
Jew'' law could cost Israel $100 million a year. Jews in the
diaspora contribute $400 million to $500 million a year.
   The North American delegation met Wednesday with heads of the
ultra-Orthodox Augudat Israel, a religious party that has led the
campaign for the legislative change.
   Rabbi Menachem Porush, an Agudat parliament member, said he
assured the delegates the law would not affect foreign communities,
only Israel.
   But Walter Hess, executive vice president of the United Israel
Appeal in Canada, said ``no progress at all'' was made toward
bridging the gap.
   ``We emphasized ... that from a diaspora point of view it is the
delegitimization of American Jewry,'' he said in an interview on
Israel radio.
   Another ultra-Orthodox political leader, Rabbi Avraham Ravitz of
the small Torah Flag Party, criticized U.S. Jewish leaders for
interfering in Israel's internal affairs.
   ``Every Jewish group that has enough money to spend a weekend in
a hotel calls themselves leaders of American Jewry,'' he told Israel
radio. ``No one voted for this leadership.''
   Also Wednesday, a group of 38 high-ranking reserve officers sent
a letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, urging him not to form a
coalition with three ultra-Orthodox religious parties.
   The officers said a government with religious parties would have
a demoralizing effect on soldiers since many ultra-Orthodox students
are exempt from army service.
   ``Their voters don't fulfill their primary defense obligations
but they will give orders to the Israel Defense Forces over how to
fight and with whom to fight,'' said Meir Zorea, a reserve general.
``They have no right to do this.''
   Shamir needs the three ultra-Orthodox parties, which control 13
seats, to form a governing majority in the 120-seat Parliament.
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc won 40 seats in the Nov. 1 election.

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old Vietnamese boy who endured
a harrowing sea voyage during which refugees reportedly resorted to
cannibalism has arrived in the United States after months of
pleading by relatives.
   Hung Quoc Tran was reunited Tuesday night with an aunt and
grandmother who live in El Dorado, Ark.
   The boy said through his aunt that he wants to forget the 36-day
boat trip, during which his parents starved to death and his brother
drowned. He was aboard a junk crammed with more than 100 refugees
fleeing Vietnam that drifted in the South China Sea.
   ``He doesn't want to remember anything about the trip _ even his
mama and his daddy. It's not good for his mind,'' said his aunt,
Tong Nguyen, who owns a diner in El Dorado, about 120 miles south of
Little Rock.
   ``He wants to start over,'' she said.
   On June 9, the junk encountered the USS Dubuque, which was on its
way to the Persian Gulf, and the refugees were given water, several
hundred pounds of food and navigational aids by the ship's officers.
But they were not taken aboard.
   Tong got word in June that her brother, sister-in-law and nephew
were dead. But she learned Hung was alive, plucked from the boat by
Filipino fishermen and detained in a United Nations camp at Puerto
Princesa in the Philippines. Half the people on the boat had died of
starvation.
   ``I was so worried _ he's only 10 years old and all alone,'' she
said.
   Tong began sending letters to officials to try to bring the boy
to El Dorado, where she settled and raised a family after fleeing
Saigon in 1975.
   At the urging of Arkansas' congressional delegation and the U.S.
Catholic Conference, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
granted him refugee status.
   His 77-year-old grandmother, Huong Nguyen, fell to her knees
sobbing at Little Rock's airport when Hung arrived, looking
bewildered by the glare of television lights. He was quickly
enveloped in an oversize white sweatshirt and matching baseball cap,
both emblazoned with a red state of Arkansas with blue letters
reading ``Native.''
   ``We are happy, but we are missing my brother and his family,''
Tong said. ``Now Hung is the only one left.''
   The Los Angeles Times has quoted unidentified sources as saying
that two boys, ages 12 and 15, were killed and eaten by some of
those aboard the boat. A 12-year-old girl who died also was eaten by
some of the refugees, the paper said.
   Hung, who speaks little or no English, described the ordeal to
his aunt but mentioned nothing about any cannibalism or killings,
she said.
   ``He tell me an American ship give them food and water and a lot
of people swim to the American ship and they tried to go (aboard)
and they don't let them come in the American ship,'' she said.
   After the incident, the Dubuque's commander, Capt. Alexander G.
Balian, 48, was relieved of his command and charged with violating a
general Navy regulation for ``wrongfully failing to render
assistance.''

<HEAD>Italy Suspends Vote on U.S. Military Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's Constitutional Court has suspended the
scheduled Dec. 11 vote on a non-binding referendum in Sardinia that
questions the presence of a U.S. military base on that island.
   A second part of the referendum, scheduled to go before the
voters in April, also asks Sardinians if they want the island to be
declared a nuclear-free zone. The court said it would decide by the
end of March whether voting could be held on the second part of the
referendum.
   The court on Tuesday suspended the December vote, ruling it first
must decide whether it is constitutional to allow Sardinian citizens
to vote on issues that are beyond their control.
   The first part of the referendum asks Sardinians if they are
against the presence of foreign military bases not approved by
Parliament that service nuclear-powered vessels or those carrying
nuclear arms.
   The only foreign base that fits the description is the U.S.
facility at La Maddalena in northeastern Sardinia which provides
minor maintenance and supplies to nuclear submarines and other small
craft.
   The Italo-American bilateral agreement which consented to the
construction of the base in 1972 was never ratified by Italy's
Parliament. The agreement as well as information gathered in
radioactivity monitoring and evacuation plans are all classified
information.
   Spokesmen at the U.S. Embassy in Rome refused to comment on
either the security of the base or the referendum.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan is vetoing
compromise legislation that, for the first time, would have imposed
restrictions on lobbying by former Cabinet officers, members of
Congress and their senior staff members, the White House announced
today.
   Chief presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, announcing
Reagan's decision to allow a Friday midnight signing deadline to
pass without action, said the administration concluded provisions in
the bill affecting executive branch employees would have discouraged
people from working for the government.
   ``The president recognizes that this disapproval may not be good
politics, but it is good government,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``These laws should be fair, impartial, easily understood and
should not erect barriers to public service,'' he said. Fitzwater
called the bill ``over-reaching'' and said it was ``sloppily put
together.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee also supported the president's veto of the measure.
   ``No doubt the president's choice will be criticized, but he made
the right choice,'' said Rostenkowski.
   Saying he shares ``the goal of assuring that government employees
act only in the best interest of the public'' Rostenkowski added
that Congress found itself ``in the position of accepting this bill
or no bill at all,''
   But he said former policymakers should not ``have to consult a
United States Attorney before making a lunch date.''
   Reagan's pocket veto came nearly a month after the president
exercised his same constitutional prerogative to kill a bill aimed
at protecting so-called ``whistleblowers'' _ federal employees who
report wrongdoing and mismanagement in their agencies.
   In the earlier case, Reagan said the bill, while
well-intentioned, would have had the effect of making it virtually
impossible for the heads of federal departments and agencies to
discipline employees.
   In advance of Reagan's announcement, President-elect George Bush
had told reporters in Washington today that if the president killed
the bill, he would push for some similar kind of legislation early
in his administration.
   ``I am going to have an ethics bill,'' Bush said before departing
for a Thanksgiving vacation at his retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.
``And it'll be a strong one. It'll be a fair one.''
   Bush also said, however, that while the ethics bill amounted to a
``very good start,'' there were some problems with certain
provisions of the legislation.
   ``There were some changes in it that I guess nobody's really
happy with,'' the vice president said.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., took vehement exception Tuesday to
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater's assertions that the
Post-Government Restrictions Act could have the effect of
prohibiting a former president from ``calling an incumbent
president.''
   Reacting to this description offered by Fitzwater on Monday,
Frank said the presidential spokesman's complaints about the bill
were rooted in ``flat lies.''
   For his part, Fitzwater backed away Tuesday from his earlier
suggestion that Reagan might withhold his signature from the
legislation because of ``strong opposition from Cabinet officials.''
   Fitzwater actually has declined all along to predict whether
Reagan would exercise his constitutional right of pocket veto by
letting a 10-ay deadline pass without his signature. The bill will
die unless Reagan signs it before 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.
   The bill was passed 347-7 in the House, and by voice vote in the
Senate, in late October.
   Under the legislation, Cabinet members and their top deputies
would be prohibited from lobbying their agency for one year after
leaving, and top executive branch staff could not lobby their agency
for a year without approval from the Office of Government Ethics.
   Besides saying initially that the bill would in effect rule out
consultations between presidents and former presidents, Fitzwater
also said that George Bush, as a former vice president, wouldn't be
allowed to call the U.S. Park Service to get a camping permit.
   Bush has not said publicly whether he recommends Reagan sign the
legislation, but The Washington Post reported in today's editions,
citing unnamed White House sources, that the president-elect urged
Reagan to sign the measure.
   Sheila Tate, Bush's spokeswoman, could not be reached for comment
Tuesday night.
   Frank, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press,
maintained that Fitzwater was overstating the bill's Draconian
effects on members of the executive branch.
   Frank called Fitzwater's interpretation ``one of the flat lies''
being stated about the legislation.
   ``In the first place, the bill only prevents you from doing this
(lobbying) if you are doing it for pay,'' the congressman said. ``If
Jimmy Carter wanted to talk to Ronald Reagan about any issue,
there's absolutely nothing that prevents that. Secondly, the bill
only applies for a year after leaving office, and, again, only if
compensation is involved.''
   Of the statement about the impact the bill would have on Bush,
Frank said ``that, too, is a lie. The bill specifically allows you
to do any lobbying for yourself or for your own business.''
   ``In fact, if George Bush went back to his (Texas) oil company,
he could lobby for it. The restrictions only apply if you're doing
it for compensation and for other people.''
   Fitzwater could not be reached for comment on Frank's statements.
   The rhetorical crossfire between Fitzwater and Frank happened as
Reagan continued his Thanksgiving week vacation, combining light
paperwork with horseback riding and chores at Rancho del Cielo in
the Santa Ynez Mountains not far from here.
   Fitzwater said the president was reviewing various position
papers on the congressionally passed legislation, but said ``we
don't know'' what Reagan's decision will be.
   One of the principal questions for Reagan is whether to accept
the harsher restrictions on post-government activities by executive
branch employees in exchange for gaining _ for the first time _ some
restrictions on revolving-door lobbying by former members of
Congress and members of their staffs.
   Although Fitzwater had emphasized on Monday what concerns had
been raised about the bill, he told reporters Tuesday, ``there are
those who have strong views for it.''
   Some members of the administration, including Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel, have complained that the legislation would discourage
people from working for the government because of a fear that they
might run afoul of the legislation in their future jobs. It includes
criminal sanctions, including fines of up to $250,000 and a
five-year prison term, for violations.
   Last month, Ann McBride, senior vice president of the Common
Cause citizens lobby, said that ``congressional passage of this
legislation strengthens revolving door restrictions on executive
branch officials and ends a double-standard by covering members of
Congress and senior congressional staffs for the first time.''

   A new state law giving officials the
right to revoke driver's licenses of students who leave school
before graduating has brought 40 dropouts back to class in one
county, officials said.
   ``This is the first time that this many re-entered,'' said Sheila
Lucento, guidance supervisor in Raleigh County, where about 300 of
the 16,500 students drop out each year.
   ``It (the law) does have some positive points,'' she said Tuesday.
   West Virginia was the first state to adopt a law earlier this
year that allows the Department of Motor Vehicles to revoke the
driver's licenses of students ages 16 to 18 who drop out before
graduating, state Schools Superintendent Tom McNeel said.
   Ron Bolen, director of the Department of Motor Vehicles safety
and enforcement division, said 248 revocation notices were mailed as
of Tuesday and 12 more were to be sent before the end of the week.
   Some have complained the law is punitive and unfair to students
who leave school for economic reasons, but the Legislature passed it
in a bid to cut down on the state's dropout rate, 28th in the nation.
   The largest city in Raleigh County is Beckley, about 60 miles
southeast of Charleston.
   Figures on the number of students returning to school in other
counties were not available.
   Officials in Kanawha County, the state's largest, said they have
not compared records to see whether the program is working, and more
than half the state's 55 county offices were closed for deer season.
   West Virginia's dropout rate was 17.4 percent last year, down
from 27 percent a decade ago. But McNeel said it is still too high.
   The first revocation notications to four male and two female
students were sent Sept. 29, Bolen said. Only three students have
asked for hearings to appeal the revocations, Bolen said.

   A lawsuit to put the Bible back on school shelves
and a teacher's desk has been filed against a principal and school
district.
   The lawsuit charges the principal ordered a teacher to remove a
Bible from his desk and ordered it and other religious books removed
from the library. A spokesman for the district said no books had
been removed from shelves.
   The lawsuit was filed Tuesday by Concerned Women of America, a
conservative Washington-based group. Named were Kathleen Madigan,
principal of Berkeley Gardens Elementary School, and the county
school district.
   A lawyer for the plaintiffs claims the case is the nation's first
``Bible censorship'' lawsuit and likely will set a precedent.
   Concerned Women of America, which claims 500,000 members
nationwide, describes itself as ``conservative, pro-life, protecting
family rights and espousing Judeo-Christian values.'' The lawsuit
was filed on behalf of fifth-grade teacher Kenneth Roberts and
parents Marc and Zay Nelson and Debra Jean White.
   Martin Semple, attorney for Adams County School District 50, said
he had no comment because he has not seen the lawsuit, filed in U.S.
District Court in Denver. A spokesman for Superintendent Mike
Massarotti said no books were taken off shelves at Berkeley Gardens.
   The lawsuit claims that after parents complained in September
1987 about religious books in Roberts' classroom, Madigan ordered
the teacher to remove the books and keep a Bible that was on his
desk out of sight during school hours. In a memo, Madigan wrote that
``the law is clear that religion may not be taught in a public
school.''
   Madigan also removed the only copy of the Bible from the school
library, the lawsuit alleges.
   In addition to unspecified damages, the lawsuit seeks a court
order to stop the alleged censorship and allow Roberts to keep his
Bible on his desk.

   Spanish colonists probably did hold a dinner of
thanks 23 years before the pilgrim's Thanksgiving of 1621, but the
dinner on what is now Texas soil is historically insignificant, a
historian says.
   ``It makes about as much difference as the fact that Leif Erikson
sighted America five centuries before Columbus,'' said Jim Cyphers,
a historian and analyst at the Massachusetts Archives. ``The
tradition of 1598 didn't go anywhere, but that that took place in
1621 did.
   ``In terms of the intellectual and social organization of the
country, the roots of Thanksgiving come from here and not from new
Spain,'' Cyphers said.
   Members of the Mission Trail Association in El Paso, Texas, say
the first Thanksgiving was held on April 30, 1598, during a journey
by Juan de Onate and 400 followers from what is now southern
Chihuahua state, Mexico, to present-day northern New Mexico.
   Capt. Gaspar Perez de Villagra kept an account of the
two-month-long journey to the Rio Grande and through the El Paso
mountain pass by the 130 men, 270 women and children and 7,000 head
of cattle. The last two weeks of the journey were spent trekking
through the Chihuahuan desert and the expedition ran out of water
five days before reaching the river.
   After 10 days of hunting, fishing and recuperating, ``We built a
great bonfire and roasted the meat and fish, and then all sat down
to a repast the like of which we had never enjoyed before,''
Villagra wrote. ``We were happy that our trials were over; as happy
as were the passengers in the Ark when they saw the dove returning
with the olive branch in his beak, bringing tidings that the deluge
had subsided.''
   The amatuer and professional historians that make up the Mission
Trail Association say they aren't trying to rewrite history, they
just want to give the Spanish colonists their due and plan to
recreate the dinner next April 30.
   ``The people in Massachusetts are probably not going to like the
idea,'' said Sheldon Hall, a Mayflower descendant and president of
the group.
   ``It's going to create a lot of talk. It's going to create a big
historical correction,'' he said.

   A man accused of diverting $34 million from a
credit union created for low-income people lived in affluence with
chartered jets, limousines and a $5,000-a-month rented house,
published reports said.
   Lawrence E. King Jr., 44, chief executive of the failed Franklin
Federal Credit Union in Omaha, was ordered by a federal judge
Tuesday to turn over most of his property to a court-appointed
receiver while a $34 million lawsuit against King is pending in U.S.
District Court.
   The National Credit Union Administration filed the lawsuit last
week, accusing King of diverting funds from Franklin for personal
and business use through a ``long series of fraudulent, dishonest
and illegal acts.''
   The lawsuit said King kept secret a second set of financial
records to hide the existence of about $34 million in certificates
of deposit.
   King allegedly used the money to pay for chartered jets, jewelry,
clothing, flowers and other expenses unrelated to the credit union,
the lawsuit said.
   King, who has declined requests for interviews, has proclaimed
his innocence. His lawyer said King used his own money to support
his lifestyle.
   U.S. District Judge William Cambridge empowered lawyer Keith I.
Frederick to take possession of King's stocks, bonds, bank deposits,
jewelry and all real estate _ except his catering business and his
home overlooking the Missouri River.
   The properties sought by the credit union administration ``are in
danger of being lost, removed or materially injured,'' according to
the order signed by Cambridge.
   Frederick was empowered to reclaim furniture and other belongings
that King sold or removed recently from his rented home in
Washington. He also was instructed to take possession of King's
jewelry, including a gold watch valued at $65,000, a $9,000 gold
ring and a set of black pearl cuff links, tie tac and shirt studs
valued at $1,000.
   King's attorney, William E. Morrow Jr., said the receivership
issue hinders resolution of the lawsuit.
   ``I don't think there is very much property for the receiver to
get his hands on,'' Morrow said.
   King was an active Republican, working with the party's Citizens
for America and the National Black Republican Council and singing
the national anthem at the 1984 GOP convention in Dallas.
   Last summer, he orchestrated a party at the GOP convention in New
Orleans for 1,000 people under the auspices of the Council on
Minority Americans, a group he heads. Caterers estimated the party
cost $100,000.
   Reports published by the Omaha World-Herald this week said King
drove a new Mercedes with a retail price of $69,300. In Washington,
he often stayed at a $5,000-a-month rented house just off Embassy
Row next to the Venezuelan Embassy, the newspaper said.
   King is described by friends as a ``philanthropic person.'' He
has served with a variety of civic organizations, such as Boys' and
Girls Clubs, YMCA, Campfire Girls, Head Start and the Salvation Army.
   ``All this comes as a surprise to us,'' said Wida Stephenson, a
member of Calvin Memorial Presbyterian Church where King is an elder.

<HEAD>Britain Plans Anonymous AIDS Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain announced Wednesday it plans random
anonymous AIDS tests using blood samples collected at the nation's
hospitals and health clinics.
   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke said the aim was to determine the
spread of the fatal disease, not to identify those individuals
carrying the AIDS virus.
   Starting in a few months, doctors will be able to screen blood
given by any person attending a hospital or clinic for tests, he
said.
   The only details kept about those screened will be sex, age, the
area where they live, and whether the test was done in a hospital,
casualty department or clinic, he said.
   Clarke said the government saw no legal or ethical objections to
testing blood samples ``taken properly in the first place for
another purpose from a patient no longer identifiable.''
   A Health Department spokeswoman who requested anonymity said the
United States ``has been testing in this fashion at selected
hospitals for some time.''
   The Medical Research Council will select within three months the
groups of people and regions of the country in which anonymous
screening will take place. Likely candidates could be emergency
victims, patients undergoing general surgery, pregnant women, and
those attending drug and sexual disease clinics, the Health
Department said.
   The spokeswoman said ``anyone who has any reason to suspect or
fear they were contaminated with the AIDS virus can say (to their
doctor), `Can I have a test?'''
   She said a Health Department committee that examined the
proposals for anonymous screening had consulted civil liberty
groups, homosexual rights groups, medical, professional and legal
bodies, and members of the public.
   The Terence Higgins Trust, which helps AIDS victims, objected
that anonymous screening cannot show how the virus ``has been
transmitted and is therefore useless in the planning of prevention
efforts.''

<HEAD>Meatpacker Agrees To Landmark Pact On Job Conditions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest meatpacker, in a landmark
move that could lead to better working conditions throughout
America's most hazardous major industry, agreed Wednesday to
redesign jobs in its 15 plants to curtail crippling muscle and nerve
ailments.
   IBP Inc. is committed to the three-year program as part of an
accord with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and
the United Food and Commercial Workers union, settling $5.7 million
in proposed fines by the government.
   The terms call for IBP, formerly known as Iowa Beef Processors,
to pay a reduced fine of $975,000 while establishing a model job
redesign program at its 2,800-worker flagship plant in Dakota City,
Neb., to address repetitive trauma disorders such as tendinitis and
carpal tunnel syndrome.
   The ailments involve an inflamation of muscle and nerve tissues
around joints, eventually rendering them incapable of movement. The
most common cause is repeated hand, wrist and arm motions _
sometimes as many as 1,000 of them an hour _ associated with cutting
meat.
   Cumulative trauma work-related disorders are the leading health
problem among packinghouse workers, who have an injury rate four
times the national average and nearly double the rate among
construction workers.
   ``This settlement is an important victory for job safety and can
serve as a model approach for reducing injuries and illnesses in one
of America's most hazardous industries,'' said Labor Secretary Ann
McLaughlin.
   ``We expect these steps to serve as an industry-wide blueprint
and to provide other industries with valuable information for
handling their own cumulative trauma disorders,'' she said.
   OSHA officials and labor leaders called IBP's recognition of the
repetitive motion disorders as an occupational illness a major
milestone in a nearly three-year-long effort to address the problem.
   Following a series of congressional hearings and OSHA
investigations largely initiated by the UFCW and the AFL-CIO's Food
and Allied Service Trades (FAST) Department, the government assessed
IBP fines of $2.6 million and $3.1 million over the last two years
for violations at the Dakota City plant.
   ``The most important thing here is not the U.S. government
collecting a fine,'' said William Wynn, the president of the union,
which includes 100,000 packinghouse workers nationwide in its
membership.
   ``Despite past differences, what's important is that we're
sitting down and trying to develop something that will make it (IBP)
a safer place to work,'' he said.
   Just last month OSHA fined another meatpacker, John Morrell &
Co., $4.33 million for ignoring what the agency said were hazards at
its plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., similar to those found at IBP's
Dakota City plant.
   But the agency said the conditions at Morrell were much worse,
with more than 800 of its 2,000 workers at Sioux Falls sustaining
what the agency called serious and disabling repetitive motion
injuries between May of 1987 and the same month this year.
   Among other charges, OSHA accused Morrell of making dozens of
workers return to jobs immediately after undergoing surgery to
correct the injuries, even though safety experts recommended they
take at least 30 to 60 days off for the wounds to heal.
   Morrell has sought to stop OSHA's enforcement activities in
federal court, saying the agency was practicing ``guilt by
headlines'' to single it out.
   Like Morrell, IBP also had bitterly contested the OSHA fines,
accusing the agency of using them ``to intimidate companies ...
unless they accept Alice in Wonderland theories'' of workplace
safety.
   Maurice McGill, IBP's executive vice president, said Wednesday
his company still disagrees with OSHA's regulatory philosophy the
past three years of targeting large companies for inspections and
assessing them stiff fines to set an example.
   But McGill acknowledged that IBP until recently had focused more
of its job safety efforts on curbing more typical injuries such as
knife cuts.
   ``Very little is understood about cumulative trauma disorders,''
he said. ``There are a number of people in this world who style
themselves as ergonomists and know all the answers. But the answers
are not quite as easy as this.''
   Under the accord, the Dakota City plant will hire a pair of
ergonomists _ people who specialize in designing jobs to fit workers
and begin implementing the changes _ such as the use of better
knives _ within three months.
   Results from several experiments at the plant are to be
implemented at IBP's 14 other meatpacking facilities over the next
three years ``where feasible,'' McGill said.
   A separate agreement between the company and the union also calls
for the establishment of a 15-member team of Dakota City workers to
evaluate all ergonomic conditions at the plant.
   Similar arrangements now exist between the United Auto Workers
and car and truck manufacturers, but this is the first time that
they have been extended to include meatpacking, union officials said.
   IBP is the nation's largest beef and pork processor, serving
largely institutional markets such as hotels, military bases and
hospital and grocery chains who sell its products under different
names. ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb., outranks IBP in total sales, but
only if its recently acquired poultry operations are counted.

   Supporters of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement
foresee dramatic growth as the two countries move toward greater
economic integration, but changes will not be visible immediately.
   ``There won't be anything that will happen on the second of
January,'' Prime Minister Brian Mulroney cautioned after winning the
parliamentary majority he needs to move forward on the agreement.
   It was signed by Mulroney and President Reagan in January and is
designed to have a gradual effect, notably in the reduction of all
remaining tariffs between the two countries over a 10-year period.
   Eighty percent of trade between the neighbors, already each
other's biggest trading partner, currently is tariff free.
   The Jan. 1 deadline the Canadian parliament will try to meet
after it returns Dec. 12 is the date foreseen for the first annual
round of tariff cuts.
   That date could be postponed if enabling legislation cannot be
completed in time in Ottawa. The U.S. Congress already has approved
all measures needed by the United States.
   Some tariffs will be eliminated immediately, others will be
lowered at a rate of 20 percent a year for five years and some at a
rate of 10 percent a year for 10 years.
   Supporters say explaining U.S.-Canadian trade as being 80 percent
tariff free already is misleading, because much potential trade
simply doesn't occur because of barriers.
   They say the agreement stimulates trade to levels previously
unimaginable as businesses on both sides of the border look to an
expanded market.
   The Economic Council of Canada has forecast the national economy
will be 2.5 percent bigger by 1998 than it would without the
agreement.
   Some adjustment will occur as tariff-protected Canadian
industries close or modify production, affecting some jobs.
   Supporters of the agreement describe it as a modest price for the
new jobs that will be created as the economy expands, a net gain of
as many as 250,000 in the first 10 years.
   Mulroney promised Tuesday that top priority for existing
government programs, like retraining, will be covering anyone
unemployed as a result of the trade agreement.
   ``We're seeking to do anything we can to cushion any blows that
come from this commercial agreement,'' he said.
   Joseph D'Cruz, a business professor at the University of Toronto,
said there will be little immediate impact on jobs or trade flows in
the first phase.
   In a telephone interview, he predicted disputes over steel will
be the first visible area as Canadian producers look to the trade
agreement for protection from what has been seen here as U.S.
harassment.
   The trade agreement also dismantles many investment barriers,
eases the flow of some services and establishes a Canada-U.S. Trade
Commission to settle disputes.
   Much remains to be defined in negotiations that will be spread
over the next five to seven years, including key questions about
what constitutes subsidies.
   Impact is expected to be greatest eventually in the automotive
industry, agriculture and energy.

   Two men were killed by gunmen who drove
alongside their car and opened fire Wednesday in an attack police
linked to local gang warfare, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
   Salvatore Bruno and his brother-in-law Paolo Lasco were killed as
they drove in this northeast suburb of Naples. Bruno, 23, was killed
instantly and Lasco, 19, died on the way to a local hospital, ANSA
said.
   The two were identified as suspected members of the Neapolitan
Mafia known as the Camorra. It said police suspected the killings
were linked to local gang warfare and possibly to a similar attack
Tuesday in which three people were shot.

<HEAD>Kentucky Task Force Seeks New Bus Safety Laws in Wake of Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A governor's task force on Wednesday
recommended 17 changes in the state's bus safety standards,
including a new emergency exit, six months after 27 people died in a
church bus crash.
   Also among the Governor's Task Force on Bus Safety
recommendations were a requirement that privately owned buses meet
federal safety standards and that the state set standards for
bidding on surplus school buses.
   ``We must prevent forever the possibility of another tragedy such
as the one that happened in Carrollton,'' said Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson, who appointed the task force. ``I believe that (the
proposed standards) will result in the saving of lives of children.''
   On May 14, a bus, bought by a church as surplus from a school
district, was carrying people home from an outing. It collided with
a pickup truck on a highway, killing 24 children and three adults.
   If the task force recommendations had been in place before the
Carrollton crash, Wilkinson said, ``I think it's fair to say that
... some lives would have been saved.''
   State Transportation Secretary Milo D. Bryant, who chaired the
task force, said the administration wants to ``make sure Kentucky
takes the lead in the nation in school bus safety. ... We owe it to
our children.''
   Most of the task force recommendations will be implemented by the
governor or by the state Transportation Cabinet, officials said.
Some recommendations, such as one requiring bus drivers to receive
more training and meet minimum federal medical requirements for
motor carriers, may require action by the General Assembly,
according to the report.
   A major recommendation of the task force is that an extra
emergency exit, on the left side, be required after Nov. 1, 1990,
for all but the smallest class of buses. The argument for left-side
exits is that a bus in an accident could roll onto its right side,
blocking exit on that side.
   In the Carrollton crash, the front door was blocked by flames
from the punctured fuel tank, leaving only the rear exit. Forty
people escaped.
   Transportation specialists of the state Department of Education
opposed the recommendation, saying a left-side door would weaken a
bus structurally.
   But Bryant was unmoved.
   ``If we can put men on the moon, I think these people can design
a bus that is structurally sound,'' Bryant said.
   Among other recommended changes, the task force also decided to
seek the repositioning of fuel tanks to make them less vulnerable to
puncture, which caused the fire aboard the church bus.
   The task force also recommended asking bus chassis manufacturers
to redesign fuel systems proven to be a fire hazard on
gasoline-powered buses and to ask the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration and the state Department of
Education to study again the possible use of seat belts or other
passive restraints on school buses.
   Other recommendations included installing ``pop-out'' windows on
buses seating 16 or more passengers, doubling to four the number of
bus evacuation drills for public school students and establishing
new seating-capacity standards to reduce crowding and make emergency
exits more accessible.

<HEAD>Thousands Recall Mayor Washington One Year After His Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harold Washington was remembered as a mayor of
vision and strength and a ``liberal in the best sense'' at a
memorial service Wednesday, one year after a massive heart attack
felled the city's first black executive.
   Some 3,100 people attended a tribute to him at a theater in the
downtown Loop, hearing former Democratic presidential contender
Jesse Jackson, writer Studs Terkel, television talk show host Oprah
Winfrey and U.S. Rep. John Conyers talk of their regard for
Washington.
   ``We miss your presence, your strength of mind, your iron will
and your vision,'' Jackson said.
   ``You challenged us to fairness,'' he said. ``You fought for an
ethics ordinance to remove the sleaze from government, to do
justice, to love mercy.''
   Washington, 65, died the day before Thanksgiving 1987, seven
months into his second term. The jovial, articulate mayor slumped
over his City Hall desk just an hour after attending a mid-morning
groundbreaking ceremony for a housing project.
   He was rushed to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and two hours
later was pronounced dead, leaving the shocked city without its
charismatic and voluble leader.
   The selection of Alderman Eugene Sawyer, a softspoken former
schoolteacher, as acting mayor by the City Council came a week after
Washington's death and followed raucous meetings among sparring
factions of the Council.
   At least four Democratic candidates have expressed intentions to
oust Sawyer in next year's election, which is expected to be decided
by the primary in heavily Democratic Chicago.
   At the service, Pulitzer-prize winning author Terkel paid tribute
to Washington's unifying vision: ``He saw the block as part of a
neighborhood. He saw the neighborhood as part of a city.
   ``He saw the city as part of a country. He saw the country was
part of a world. They were inseparable. And that's what made him a
mayor with the possibility of being the best.
   ``Certainly he was the most literate mayor Chicago ever had,''
added Terkel, who cited Washington's well-known penchant for reading.
   Winfrey noted Washington's easygoing and affable style, as well
as his contributions to social progress and civil rights.
   ``If we truly want to let the world know, and this city know,
that his life meant something to us, we must in our own lives,
through our own action, carry out his doctrine,'' she said.
   Mary Ella Smith, Washington's longtime companion, paid a tearful
tribute to him as a man who, throughout his life, ``was always
chipping and picking away at some form of inequity and injustice,
always trying to help those who did not have sufficient resources to
help themselves.''
   She was joined in her praise by Sawyer and Conyers, D-Mich., a
close friend of Washington who called him ``a liberal in the best
sense. He took his job seriously, as a representative of his
constitutents.''
   Many of those attending the morning service, one of three planned
for the day, were schoolchildren.
   Letha Robinson, 10, a fourth grader at Robert Healy School, said
of Washington: ``He liked the white people and black people, no
matter what color they were. He said, `They're still people.'''

<HEAD>Inspection Never Made As Claimed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The site of a fuel tank that collapsed early
this year, fouling two major rivers with oil and threatening water
supplies to communities in three states, was never inspected as
claimed by a county official, police said.
   Charles E. Kelly, 58, who was chief inspector in the Allegheny
County fire marshal's office, told authorities he did not visit the
tank owned by Ashland Oil Inc. as he reported in a memo dated May
19, 1986, the county's Assistant Police Superintendent Richard
Winters said Tuesday.
   Kelly resigned Friday. He declined comment on Wednesday.
   More than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled into the
Monongahela River when a dime-size flaw in a steel wall caused the
tank to collapse. The Jan. 2 accident, called one of the country's
biggest inland oil spills, occurred as the 40-year-old tank was
being filled for the first time since being moved from the Cleveland
area.
   Drinking water was cut off to about 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh
residents, and supplies were threatened in riverside communities in
Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia as the oil slick moved through
the lower Monongahela and down the Ohio River.
   Environmental officials tracked the slick for a month as it moved
hundreds of miles down the Ohio River.
   Fire Marshal Martin A. Jacobs, 38, also resigned Friday. Jacobs
admitted that he lied under oath when he said he knew nothing about
the memo, in which Kelly said approval was granted to build the tank.
   Deputy Fire Marshal Edward Babyak, who revealed the memo to
Ashland attorneys during a deposition last month, refused to resign
and was suspended.
   Ashland officials say the memo confirms their claim that they
received verbal approval to erect the tank.

   Doctors said Wednesday that 10-day-old Siamese
twins who share a heart and liver cannot be separated.
   ``The final concensus of experts at the University of Maryland
Medical System is that the twins cannot be separated,'' hospital
spokeswoman Rochelle Cohen said.
   ``Separation to save one baby would result in the death of both
babies. The family has been informed and understands this sad news.
Given the malformation of the single heart that the twins share,
doctors do not anticipate the twins will live for a very long period
of time,'' she said.
   She said the babies could live days or months.
   The hospital has not identified the parents and would release no
other information except to say that the twins, born Nov. 13, are in
stable condition.
   Siamese twins occur about once every 100,000 births. Siamese
twins were successfully separated at University Hospital in June
1986. Twins from West Germany, who were joined at the head, were
separated at Johns Hopkins Hospital in September 1987.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats raised new legal and
fairness concerns Wednesday about a Federal Communications
Commission proposal to replace profit regulation of telephone
companies with caps on prices.
   A report by the Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee says the FCC's proposal fails to
assure that rates for regulated phone service will be ``just and
reasonable,'' as required by the Communications Act.
   The FCC has proposed to change the way it regulates American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the regional Bell phone companies by
lifting limits on the profits they can earn and instead set a
ceiling on rates. The price cap would limit rate increases to three
percentage points less than annual inflation.
   The agency estimated the plan, which would be optional for the
phone companies, could save consumers $1.6 billion over four years
if all the companies participated. Long-distance bills would be
about one-half of a percentage point lower annually than they would
be under traditional profit regulation, the FCC said.
   But the report by the staff of the panel headed by Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., said Congress intended that rate regulation of
``dominant carriers'' _ phone companies controlling major portions
of the business in a market _ be based on the costs of providing
service.
   ``As currently structured, the price cap scheme will permit
carriers to set prices that may deviate significantly from costs,''
the report said. ``There is no assurance that rates would remain
even within a `zone' of reasonableness.''
   FCC spokesman John Kamp said the commission had not received the
report, but ``the question of the commission's authority to move to
a price-cap plan has been explored in detail throughout this
proceeding and we have concluded to date that there is no legal
impediment to commission action.'' He added: ``We will consider
carefully any new legal issues contained in this report.''
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick, who has long wanted to loosen
telephone regulation with a system of price caps, has been pushing
for a final vote on the plan at the commission's Dec. 2 meeting,
despite strong indications from Democrats on Capitol Hill that
action taken before Congress returns would intensify the bad
relations between the FCC and lawmakers.
   ``I will not rush this issue to judgment, but I also won't delay
it beyond the time at which it's ripe for decision,'' Patrick said
last week.
   Patrick, who left earlier this week to spend the Thanksgiving
holiday in California, could not be reached for comment on the
report or whether he would put the price-cap issue on the
commission's Dec. 2 agenda. Commission sources said a decision would
be made Friday, when the FCC must announce the items that will be on
that agenda.
   Sources close to Patrick say he is not wedded to considering a
price-cap proposal at the Dec. 2 meeting and would be content to put
it off until January. He said last week, however, ``It's something I
want considered in my lifetime ... at the commission.''
   Though he is not expected to leave immediately, many doubt that
Patrick will remain as FCC chairman for more than the first few
months of the Bush administration. They speculate that Bush will
want a new FCC chairman to repair the agency's tattered relations
with Congress.
   The biggest problem for Patrick right now is getting a second
vote for his proposal. With two vacancies on the commission, he sits
on the panel with two Democrats, and both have indicated concerns
about the plan.

<TEXT>
   The foreign minister on
Wednesday denounced the U.S. government for its ``arrogance'' in
criticizing the treason convictions of four black activists.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Monday the
South African government was using protracted legal procedings and
imprisonment to neutralize prominent black opponents. He referred to
the convictions last of week of four prominent activists at the
close of a three-year treason trial.
   ``Several of these defendants are highly regarded spokespersons
for peaceful black opposition to the injustices wrought by apartheid
in South Africa,'' Redman said. ``It's inconceivable that their
political activities would have qualified as treason or terrorism in
this country or any other democracy.''
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, in a statement released Wednesday
evening, said, ``The arrogance and meddlesome interference of the
U.S. government in this matter is rejected as unwarranted and
thoroughly inappropriate.''
   ``South Africa's ambassador in Washington has been instructed to
convey the South African government's strong protest against this
unwarranted interference to the U.S. government at the appropriate
level,'' Botha added.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said Redman's statement ``was
unfounded interference which bespoke of an uninformed, if not
biased, mind.''
   ``The entire judicial system does not take second p

   lace to the
U.S. system or any system,'' Coetsee said.
   A pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, said in an editorial
that the United States should ``keep its damned nose out of our
judicial affairs.''
   ``South Africa is not a banana republic with justice manipulated
by the government,'' it said. ``Our courts are totally independent
and even Mr. Redman would have a fair trial if he were here to
answer a contempt of court charge.''

   A group suing the government on behalf of the
homeless said Wednesday that federal agencies are refusing to hand
over vacant properties for housing, despite a judge's order to do so.
   The National Coalition for the Homeless said it has identified
federal buildings, ranging from military barracks to office
buildings, on land in 10 states that could be used for sheltering
the homeless.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch ruled on Sept. 30 that the
government cannot sell surplus real estate until it has complied
with a law requiring it to make vacant property available for the
homeless.
   According to the coalition, property in Virginia, Oregon,
Illinois, Oklahoma, California, Minnesota, Arizona, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia could be
used to give the homeless a place to live.
   ``Winter is upon us, yet in the almost two months since the court
ruled, the administration has taken absolutely no action to make
property available,'' the group said in a prepared statement.
   The group's report provided no estimate of how many homeless
people could be served by handing over this property.
   Arthur Goldberg, an attorney for the government in the case, said
he did not want to comment on anything to do with the lawsuit.
   At a hearing last week, the judge complained that the government
agencies have not moved quickly enough to make the housing available
as winter approaches.
   ``I know brueaucrats,'' Gasch said in a transcript of the hearing
provided by the coalition. ``The thing you've got to do with
bureaucrats is crack the whip and see to it they do the job.''

   A man convicted of arson in Florida has been
offered a plea bargain without further prison time on a charge of
setting a 1984 fire that nearly destroyed a landmark church, it was
reported Wednesday.
   Philip Joseph Melanson, 30, would receive a suspended sentence if
he followed his Florida lawyer's advice and accepts the agreement,
the Concord Monitor said. It quoted Kelly Sims, the public defender
who represented Melanson in a series of arson cases in Orlando, Fla.
   Melanson, 30, a former Concord resident, was indicted last week
by a Merrimack County grand jury on charges that he set the fire at
St. Paul's Episcopal Church and six others in the city in 1983 and
1984.
   County Attorney Michael Johnson offered Melanson the suspended
sentence as part of an agreement on all seven fires, Sims told the
paper. Sims said Johnson negotiated the agreement through him.
   Sims said he advised Melanson to accept it.
   Johnson would neither confirm nor deny the agreement, saying he
is barred from discussing evidence before trial. He said only that
``extensive discussions'' between his office and Sims ``were
fruitful.''
   Johnson said that when Melanson gets a lawyer in New Hampshire,
any agreement could be challenged or vetoed by a judge.
   A Concord detective questioned Melanson about six weeks ago on a
tip from Florida investigators. Melanson was convicted this summer
of setting three fires in Orlando, and confessed to setting more
than 50 others, according to Florida investigators.
   He was sentenced to nine years in prison in Florida, but Sims
expects him to serve only three years.

<TEXT>
   The prosecutor who brought drug indictments against
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and top leaders of the
Medellin drug cartel resigned Wednesday from the U.S. attorney's
office.
   Richard Gregorie, 41, chief assistant to U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen, said he planned to join a private law firm that
specializes in civil cases.
   ``I have had the opportunity to investigate, indict and prosecute
the most important cases in the United States, and at all times I
have been able to do what was right,'' Gregorie said in his
resignation letter.
   Noriega, as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, is widely
considered Panama's de facto ruler. In February he was indicted by a
grand jury in Florida on drug smuggling charges. Noriega has denied
the accusations.
   Gregorie presented the case to the grand jury in February, and
later fought against a proposal to drop the indictment as part of a
political deal to get the general out of Panama.
   He also brought the first major indictment against leaders of the
powerful and violent Medellin Cartel, believed responsible for up to
80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports, although none of the leaders has
been brought to the country for prosecution in that 1984 case.
   Gregorie initially said he would resign effective Dec. 31, but he
was informed Wednesday that a hearing on a dismissal motion in the
Noriega case had been scheduled for Jan. 3, and he told The
Associated Press he would delay his departure until after that date.
   ``This case is very important to me,'' Gregorie said from Boston
where he was visiting friends.
   Gregorie has been with the Miami office for 17 years.

   Federal and state authorities are investigating
more than 20 deaths linked to the illegal use of the heroin
substitute China White in the Pittsburgh area.
   U.S. Attorney J. Alan Johnson said Tuesday the death toll
associated with the drug has risen from 14, but would not disclose
where or when the additional deaths occurred.
   Authorities had been attributing 14 deaths since mid-October to
the drug, considered 700 times more powerful than heroin. China
White still has not been confirmed as the cause of any of the
deaths. Lab tests for the substance are complex.
   The prosecutor has assembled a federal grand jury to meet next
month to investigate the source of the drug.
   Five people were arrested last week on drug charges in the case.

   A benefactor put the trill back in flutist Helene
Holmberg's life Wednesday, replacing the rare instrument that was
stolen from her three days earlier.
   ``My flute is my life. ... I'm so grateful,'' Miss Holmberg, a
24-year-old musician from Stockholm, said as she held a handcrafted
Yamaha silver flute in one hand and a check for $5,500 to pay for it
in the other.
   Then she gave her thanks with music, playing two Swedish folk
airs to her benefactor, Michel Roux, president of Carillon
Importers, a liquor importing firm in Teaneck, N.J.
   Roux, a Frenchman who has lived in the United States 22 years and
supports various social and cultural philanthropies, heard about the
stolen flute through news reports.
   ``Whoever took the flute didn't take her will or her talent,'' he
told friends of the flutist in the chapel of the Church of Sweden in
Manhattan.
   Miss Holmberg had come to New York last week under a scholarship
from the Juilliard School of Music. Her Muramatso flute was stolen
during a concert Sunday at a Brooklyn church. When the audience
heard, they passed the hat for her and collected $370.
   The flute, which she played for six years, was insured for only
about half its $8,000 cost in Sweden.
   ``I like this new one very much,'' she said. ``But I have to put
my soul in it first, and that takes time.''

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush, who has
said repeatedly he wants a team of new faces, picked yet another
veteran of past administrations Wednesday in naming retired Air
Force Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft to be his national security adviser.
   Scowcroft, who held the same job in the administration of
President Ford, was also an adviser to Presidents Nixon and Carter
and headed commissions for President Reagan. ``He has made and will
continue to make important contributions to the design of U.S.
foreign policy,'' Bush said.
   Bush mixed his announcement with warm praise for Reagan's current
national security adviser, Colin Powell, who he said had turned in
``an outstanding performance.'' Powell called his successor ``a
superb choice'' in a statement released in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
where he was accompanying the vacationing Reagan.
   There was also praise from both Republican and Democratic
senators. ``An excellent appointment,'' said Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Scowcroft is
``extremely able and experienced,'' said Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who
was chairman when the Republicans controlled the Senate. ``An
excellent choice,'' said Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed
Services Committee.
   The vice president made the announcement _ his sixth high-level
selection _ in Washington before he and his wife flew to their
oceanside family compound here for a five-day Thanksgiving vacation.
   At a welcoming rally in Kennebunkport, Bush greeted several
thousand residents, telling them ``Barbara and I want to be good
neighbors.'' It was his first time back here since early August
before the Republican National Convention.
   Referring to his helicopter landing on the grounds of St. Ann's
Episcopal Church, where his family worships, Bush boasted, ``I'm
wondering what my old man would say if he could see his little boy
now.''
   It was a reference to his late father, Sen. Prescott Bush. The
vice president recalled he had been come to the family vacation home
in every one of his 64 years except one _ during World War II.
   He reiterated a campaign pledge to permit lobstermen to continue
working their traps in the cove beside his house, despite security
concerns of the Secret Service.
   He told residents he shared their concern with a recent boost in
local property taxes, vowed to drive his speedboat slowly in the
river that runs through town and promised to ``try not to hold up
traffic.''
   Earlier in Washington, the vice president described Scowcroft,
63, as a ``trusted friend'' with whom he had worked ``in various
capacities in the past,'' both as vice president and as CIA director.
   ``I'm going to count on him to coordinate the development of my
national security policy,'' Bush said.
   However, another major link in working on that policy _ his
choice for defense secretary _ remained missing.
   Despite widespread speculation that he will name former Senate
Armed Services Committee Chairman John Tower of Texas, Bush declined
to confirm that in a question-and-answer session with reporters at
the Old Executive Office Building.
   He would only say that he wanted ``somebody to manage'' the
Pentagon who could ``institute the reforms that I talked about
during the campaign.''
   Asked if he regretted that the delay on the appointment appeared
to leave Tower ``twisting in the wind,'' Bush said that, yes, he was
sorry ``on a human basis.''
   But, he added:
   ``I understand the insatiable curiosity about who's going to be
staffing this administration. I understand it. But I'm less tense
about it than I used to be.''
   Bush announced previously that he would nominate his campaign
chairman and longtime friend, former Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III, as secretary of state, and would retain three recent
Reagan appointees: Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Education
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   He also said Monday he would nominate Baker's former deputy,
Richard Darman, to the Cabinet-level post of budget director. He
said then that ``in all likelihood'' there would be no more Cabinet
holdovers.
   Scowcroft, who appeared alongside Bush on Wednesday, headed a
special commission in 1983 that studied basing of the MX missile.
   More recently, he was a member of the commission headed by Tower
that studied the Iran-Contra arms affair for the administration. The
commission found fault with White House management of the National
Security Council but had little to say about any Bush role.
   Asked about changes at the National Security Council after the
Iran-Contra affair, Scowcroft said, ``I am very pleased. I think
that Gen. Powell and Secretary (Frank) Carlucci before him have left
the NSC staff in really excellent condition, and it will be a joy to
assume responsibility for the system the way it is operating now.''
   As for defense, he said the military budget ``is substantially
underfunded.'' He praised Carlucci, the outgoing defense secretary
for having ``already taken some very courageous steps in the
direction of readjusting the defense program. More has to be done.''
   A 1947 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,
Scowcroft served as a professor of Russian history and political
science at both West Point and the Air Force Academy.
   He was Nixon's military assistant in the early 1970s, then was
deputy to Henry Kissinger when Kissinger served both as secretary of
state and national security adviser during the Nixon and Ford
administrations.
   When Kissinger gave up the national security post in 1975, it
went to Scowcroft.
   Bush has voiced annoyance over leaks about prospective Cabinet
appointees, and scheduled Wednesday's announcement himself, without
giving aides advance notice.
   In fact, many reporters who regularly cover Bush had already gone
to Maine after being told by transition officials that Bush planned
no public appearances before the town rally.
   ``I think we've demonstrated that things can be announced without
leaks,'' Bush said, grinning.

   A police officer and a county affirmative
action director have been charged with giving drug dealers
information about police undercover operations in exchange for
cocaine and marijuana, officials said Wednesday.
   Haverstraw officials had even considered promoting the 16-year
police veteran, Victor Nieves, 46, of Monroe, from community affairs
and youth officer to detective and putting him in charge of finding
out why the undercover operations were failing.
   ``These actions could have led to the deaths of police
officers,'' said Rockland County District Attorney Kenneth Gribetz.
``This could have led literally to acts of murder of police officers
who were engaged in undercover activities.''
   Nieves was arrested Tuesday night along with Luis Del Pilar, 40,
of West Haverstraw, Rockland's affirmative action director. Their
activities were uncovered by court-ordered wiretaps in the course of
a six-month probe, authorities said.
   Both were charged with hindering prosecution and criminal
facilitation and were being held on $10,000 bond after arraignment
Tuesday night.
   Authorities said the men supplied dealers with the time and
location of the execution of search warrants and arrest warrants by
the Rockland County Narcotic Task Force. They also performed
license-plate checks on vehicles being used by undercover officers
and illegally used the New York State Police Information Network to
try to identify and verify the vehicles driven by undercover
officers, authorities said.
   Del Pilar is accused of using his official capacity to gain
access to personnel files to learn identities of undercover officers.
   Gribetz said over the past few years law enforcement officials
had become increasingly concerned over the lack of success of
undercover operations in Haverstraw, north of New York City.
   The wiretaps were placed on the phone of Luis Jerez, 39, of
Pomona, described by Gribetz as a ``large-scale street dealer.''
   The other wiretaps were placed in the offices of the Juvenile Aid
Bureau in the Haverstraw Police Department.
   In five weeks, Jerez received 2,500 calls, said Gribetz.
   ``It became very clear that Nieves ... and Del Pilar ... were
supplying critical information to Jerez,'' said Gribetz.
   Jerez was held in lieu of $1 million in Arapahoe County Jail in
Arapahoe, Colo., after he was arrested at his girlfriend's home in
Aurora, Colo.
   He was charged with selling cocaine and conspiracy.
   Gribetz said he hoped the arrests would allow law enforcement
officials to ``make a dent'' in narcotic trafficking in the area.
   Gribetz would not say whether any other officials may have been
involved, but said the investigation was continuing.
   Both Nieves, one of four Hispanics on the 26-member force, and
Del Pilar were considered role models for the Hispanic community,
which accounts for about half Haverstraw's population of 10,000
people, said Mayor Frank Haera.
   ``The kids in this town are going to be so disappointed,' said
Carmen Lopez, president of La Flor, the Latin American Feminine
League of Rockland. ``He (Nieves) is their idol. It's like Kennedy
dying.''
   Police Chief Michael Holland described Nieves as ``an excellent
police officer.''
   ``Victor was an officer we trusted. There's tremendous upset in
the force and in the town,'' Holland said.

   President Reagan announced Wednesday
he was vetoing legislation making technical corrections to a health
programs bill he had signed earlier.
   Reagan said provisions in the corrections bill involving
health-related aspects of the government's campaign to curb drug
abuse are identical to the sweeping anti-drug abuse legislation he
signed last week, and the bill therefore was unnecessary.

   A long-awaited new grain deal with the Soviet
Union may be near, Agriculture Department spokesmen said late
Wednesday.
   The department's information office said that no announcement
would be forthcoming but that ``something may be in the works'' at
some point in the next few days, possibly next Monday.
   Negotiators led by Alan F. Holmer, deputy U.S. trade
representative, have been attempting to reach agreement with Soviet
representatives for months. The old pact expired Sept. 30. It called
for minimum annual purchases of U.S. corn and wheat.
   Despite no new deal, the Soviets have been buying U.S. grain in
large amounts this fall, mainly corn but also including sorghum
grain and soybeans.

<TEXT>
   The head of a Temple University group that
advocates ``white pride'' says the organization isn't racist, but
was formed to balance the ``pro-minority'' stance taken by school
officials.
   ``I'm not against anybody. I don't hate anybody,'' said Michael
Spletzer, leader of the White Student Union. ``I think we have one
of the richest cultures in the world. But as soon as anything about
rights for whites comes up, it's called racism.''
   A flier promoting the 89-member WSU says whites are ``the only
major segment of the population that is not encouraged to take pride
in its heritage and in the achievements of its ancestors.'' It
encourages people to ``Be White and proud!''
   Spletzer, 22, pointed to other Temple student groups, such as the
African-American Student League or the Society of Black Accountants
or the Society of Black Engineers as examples of organizations that
use racial designations.
   Spletzer also said he was disillusioned by Temple's special
scholarships for minorities, affirmative action programs and the
educational philosophy.
   Temple spokeswoman Kathy Gosliner said Tuesday that university
officials decided to recognize the WSU after reviewing the group's
application with a lawyer. Another spokesman said official
recognition entitles student organizations to use certain university
facilities, a faculty adviser, consideration for university office
space and $1,000 annual support for student activities.
   The school's chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People ``will take direct action'' against
the WSU if they determine it to be racist, said chapter president
Vaughn Goodwin.
   ``For one race to come out and say racial pride of others is just
talk is indirectly indoctrinating racism,'' he said.
   Gosliner said she did not know whether similar groups had formed
at other schools.

<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday banned all mass
gatherings in Kosovo after five days of huge public demonstrations
against Serbian meddling in the affairs of the restive southern
province.
   In Skopje, about 15,000 Macedonians demonstrated outside the
Greek consulate about alleged discrimination against the Macedonian
minority in neighboring northern Greece.
   The Kosovo protests were inspired by the forced resignations from
the provincial Communist Party Politburo of two members representing
the ethnic Albanian majority, Kacusa Jasari and Azem Vlasi. Serbia's
Communist Party had pressured for the resignations.
   Kosovo, which borders Albania, is a province of the Serbian
republic but has considerable autonomy. Serbia has been seeking
greater control.
   Since the resignations, crowds of up to 100,000 have demonstrated
for the reinstatement of Jasari and Vlasi.
   A statement by the Serbian leadership, carried by Belgrade radio
Wednesday, said the protests were inspired by ethnic Albanian
``nationalists and separatists.'' Ninety percent of Kosovo's
population is ethnic Albanian.
   Rahman Morina, Kosovo's interior minister, said Wednesday that
``extraordinary circumstances have taken place which threaten public
order,'' the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
   ``All those failing to comply'' with the ban on demonstrations
``will be subject to all legal and other measures,'' Tanjug said
without elaboration.
   No demonstrations were reported Tuesday or early Wednesday from
Pristina, the provincial capital 240 miles south of Belgrade.
   Communist Party leaders in Kosovo have promised to review the
resignations of Jasari and Vlasi at a meeting tentatively scheduled
for this week.
   Observers said protests may resume unless they are reinstated, so
the ban on gatherings might be pre-emptive.
   Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian party leader, pressed for the
resignations as part of his campaign for greater control of the
province.
   Kosovo won broad autonomy in the 1974 constitution, which
Milosevic wants changed to protect the Serb and Montenegrin
minorities in Kosovo from alleged harassment by the ethnic Albanian
majority.
   The protest in Skopje was a chapter in the decades-long dispute
over territory and population in Macedonia, now divided among
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Greece.
   Officials in Greece and Yugoslavia frequently argue over what
Yugoslavia says is a large Macedonian presence in northern Greece.
Wednesday's protest was organized by the student union of the
university in Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
   Yugoslavia's ever-present ethnic problems have become worse since
an economic crisis and inflation, now running at 236 percent
annually, began cutting into living standards. The nation has a
foreign debt of $21 billion.
   Market-oriented reforms have been introduced to restructure the
state-dominated economy.

<HEAD>North Ordered To Specify Secrets To Be Raised At Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case Wednesday
gave Oliver L. North until Dec. 19 to specify any additional
government secrets the former presidential aide would disclose in
his defense at trial.
   U.S. District Gerhard A. Gesell's order applies to testimony
about foreign policy secrets North's lawyers expect to elicit during
courtroom questioning of government officials called as witnesses in
the case.
   It also referred to any documents in North's possession that he
did not obtain from prosecutors during pre-trial discovery. Several
hundred thousand pages of secret material were turned over to North,
and, of that, he served notice he wished to use about 40,000 pages
at trial.
   Gesell ordered that the list ``shall be particularized and
directed only to those documents or other information he considers
relevant and material to his defense.''
   North's notice should be ``accompanied by the underlying
classified documents and by separate written summaries of any other
testimonial information,'' the judge said.
   Gesell ruled that North's lawyers would not have to show the list
to independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, thereby preventing
prosecutors from getting a preview of defense strategy.
   The order was issued two days after Gesell delivered a pointed
warning from the bench that he would have ``very little control''
over the testimony of current or former officials ``acquainted with
high-security matters.''
   Gesell warned that secret intelligence or diplomatic initiatives
could be divulged at North's trial, which he predicted might get
under way in late January, unless President Reagan intervenes to
prevent the case from going forward.
   Reagan could invoke the Classified Information Procedures Act to
block secret information from being introduced as evidence,
provoking dismissal of some or all of the charges against North.
   In his comments from the bench, the judge appealed to the Reagan
administration to focus on the problems posed by disclosure of such
secrets at a public trial.
   Gesell had warned that he would be forced to give North's lawyers
``wide latitude'' to cross-examine many of these witnesses about
their ``involvement in sensitive events other than events relevant
under the indictment.''
   The former presidential aide and retired Marine lieutenant
colonel is charged with conspiring with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and two arms dealers to illegally divert
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Gesell has yet to rule on the prosecutor's motion to strike
North's Nov. 14 filing, and bar him from introducing any of the
secret documents into evidence.
   In a motion to bar defense use of any of the 40,000 pages of
material, Walsh accused North of trying to ``provoke a dismissal''
of the case by threatening to disclose ``some of our nation's most
valuable secrets.'' wants to disclose when the case goes to trial.
   In Wednesday's order, Gesell said that after the additional
notice is filed Dec. 19, ``all classified documents and other
classified testimonial information the defense presently reasonably
expects to disclose at trial will have been covered by some form of
notice.''
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the judge must
determine if any of the secret material is relevant to the case and
admissable as evidence.
   If the government is unwilling to allow disclosure of evidence
that Gesell finds is important to North's case, he could dismiss

<HEAD>Soldiers Wound Nine Young Palestinians in General Strike</HEAD>

   Israeli soldiers shot a 5-year-old boy in the
leg and wounded eight Arab teen-agers Wednesday during a general
strike in the occupied territories, hospital spokesmen reported.
   A 13-year-old boy died of a bullet wound in the head received in
a confrontation with soldiers Saturday in the West Bank village of
Beita, near Nablus, the army said.
   At least 315 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising that
began nearly a year ago in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in 1967. Eleven Israelis
have beem slain.
   The leftist organization Peace Now urged Israel to negotiate with
the Palestine Liberation Organization. It was time a large national
group had challenged the government's decision to spurn the PLO
declaration of a Palestinian state.
   Residents of the West Bank and Gaza closed stores Wednesday,
blocked roads and flew outlawed Palestinian flags. Underground PLO
leaders called the strike to protest dozens of deportations by
Israel since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, among the 1.5 million
Palestinians who live in the occupied lands.
   Palestinians have conducted dozens of general strikes during the
uprising.
   Israeli soldiers shot the 5-year-old boy during an encounter with
young stone-throwers in the West Bank village of Maythaloon, said
officials at Al Ittihad hospital in nearby Nablus.
   An Arab journalists said soldiers began shooting when stones were
thrown after they entered the village to force residents to
obliterate anti-Israeli slogans.
   The army said it was checking reports that eight teen-agers had
been wounded.
   In an ad in the Jerusalem Post, Peace Now group said to the
government: ``Stop blinding the public! An opening for peace has
emerged; we must widen it. Only through negotiations will we know if
the PLO has really adopted the path of peace.''
   Galia Golan, a leader of the group, said: ``The PLO declaration
doesn't say everything we'd like it to, but they seem to be reaching
a watershed and moving in a particular direction we have to move.''
   Last week in Algeria, the Palestine National Council declared a
Palestinian state and adopted a political statement accepting U.N.
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which implicitly recognize
Israel. The council acts as the PLO legislature.
   Israel immediately rejected the move. Officials said it was
``double-talk'' because it did not include explicit recognition.
   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshed said Wednesday a decision
is expected within 10 days on whether Rabbi Moshe Levinger will be
charged in the killing of a Palestinian and the wounding of another.
Levinger founded the Gush Emunim movement for settlements in the
occupied territories.
   Ran Cohen, a member of parliament from the left-wing Citizens
Rights Movement, said he had a letter from police saying
investigators recommended Levinger be tried.
   A 42-year-old shopkeeper was killed and another man wounded when
Levinger opened fire after Palestinians threw stones at settlers in
Hebron on Sept. 30, authorities have reported.

<HEAD>Poll Indicates Most Israelis Want Joint Government</HEAD>

   Nearly 60 percent of Israelis would prefer a
joint government of the rival Likud and Labor parties that excluded
small extremist factions, according to a public opinion survey
published Wednesday.
   The left-leaning Labor Party broke off coalition negotiations
with the right-wing Likud bloc on Tuesday, but leaders of both
parties hinted on Wednesday that a resumption of contacts was
possible.
   The poll published by the Haaretz daily was based on a telephone
survey of 506 Israelis conducted by the private Telskar Institute
over two days this week.
   It indicated nearly 60 percent wanted an exclusive Likud-Labor
government that would change Israel's electoral system and call new
elections, the paper said. It did not give an exact number or a
margin of error for the survey.
   The poll also was carried by the mass-circulation Maariv daily,
which said most supporters of a joint government were left-wing
voters who feared extremist religious and anti-peace policies could
be expected from a right-wing Cabinet.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader, was charged with
forming the next government after his party won 40 seats to Labor's
39 in the Nov. 1 parliamentary elections.
   Aides said Tuesday that Shamir hoped to build a Cabinet by next
week. But negotiations have grown complicated with the seven small
religious and ultra-right-wing factions whose support Shamir needs
to claim a majority in the 120-member parliament.
   Militant parties are vying for control of the Housing Ministry,
which would enable them to build more Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories.
   The religious parties are demanding a ``Who is a Jew'' law that
would accept only conversions to Judaism carried out by Orthodox
rabbis. The proposal angered American Jewish leaders, raising
concern about a possible erosion of support for Israel in the United
States.
   President Chaim Herzog asked Shamir to include Labor in a
broad-based government, but Labor broke off talks after Likud
refused to concede two out of the three key ministries _ defense,
foreign affairs and finance.
   Labor also sought a more clear-cut commitment by Likud to working
for a resumption of Middle East peace talks.
   Many saw Labor's move mainly as a bargaining tactic and signs
emerged Wednesday that leaders of both parties were maneuvering back
to the negotiating table.
   Israel radio quoted Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a Labor Party
member, as saying his party ``did not speak of severing contacts but
only of halting them.''
   Cabinet Minister Moshe Arens, who is in charge of Likud's
negotiating strategy, said on the radio that the talks could be
renewed. ``If the other side has the good will and the willingness
to invest time and effort I think it is possible,'' he said.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, a leading far-right member of
Likud, was also quoted as saying he hoped contacts with Labor would
be resumed.
   Maariv quoted Shamir as saying he wanted the talks resumed and
was willing to consider relinquishing the Foreign Ministry portfolio
to Labor.
   Israeli newspapers were divided about prospects of a joint
government.
   ``The last word hasn't been said,'' Maariv wrote in an editorial.
``Even opponents can find some logic to a Likud-Labor hook-up, if
both these parties as a government can prevent the disintegration of
unity in our people.''
   Other newspapers said prospects of Labor and Likud getting
together again appeared slim.

<HEAD>Millions Of Starving Rabbits Invade Australian Outback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of rabbits driven by hunger,
heat and drought are swarming across Australia's arid Outback,
devouring all vegetation in their path in one of the worst such
plagues ever, officials said Wednesday.
   The damage done by the wild rabbits threatens farming and
livestock.
   In addition, scientists from the South Australian state
government's Animal and Plant Control Commission said they were
trying to measure the ecological impact of the infestation, which
has ravaged thousands of square miles of the sparsely populated
interior called the Outback.
   The plague follows a drought that has lasted for weeks.
   Farmers said dead and dying rabbits were filling dried river beds
and water holes. News reports said the rabbits were so desperate for
food and water they were licking plates left by campers.
   The Quinyambie cattle station, several hundred miles north of
Adelaide, said it was overrun with rabbits. Brian Cooke, the
commission's senior research officer, estimated 24 million rabbits
invaded the ranch.
   But Ron Hyde, manager of the 2,800-square-mile station on the
border between the state of South Australia and New South Wales,
said he thought the estimate was low.
   ``Some areas of the ground are virtually moving around here.
There are so many of them,'' he said by radio telephone. ``Every
inch of shade beneath trees and bushes and by fence posts is packed
with rabbits trying to escape the sun.''
   Cooke said it was the worst plague on record. ``I've never seen
anything like it,'' he said, describing a field trip where thousands
of rabbits huddled in the shade to escape the 115-degree summer heat.
   Rabbits, introduced by the first European settlers 200 years ago,
took to Australia because it has no natural predators. They became
one of the worst pests on the island continent.
   He said the explosion in rabbit numbers began in a
155,000-square-mile mainly pastoral region in far northeast South
Australia and part of New South Wales and that the animals were
moving south, where it is cooler.
   Australia's wild rabbit population is estimated to exceed 200
million, or about 13 rabbits for every Australian, according to the
government-funded Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics.
   Rabbits cost Australia millions of dollars a year in lost
agricultural production, the bureau said. They produce six to seven
litters a year, bearing about five to six offspring each time.
   ``The drought has left rabbits high and dry,'' said Cooke.
``They've eaten the place out. Millions of them are dropping dead.
   ``They have eaten out all the vegetation,'' he said. ``Without
successful regeneration, these areas will become increasingly
treeless with no feed and shelter for stock and wildlife during the
drought years.''
   The Outback abounds with wildlife such as kangaroos, wild horses,
buffalo, goanna lizards and dingoes, the native Australian wild dog,
as well as fragile plants not found outside Australia.
   Commercial shooters are having a field day on the Quinyambie
ranch, shooting up to 400 rabbits a night for their skins and for
use in pet food. Hyde said two teams of 12 shooters each were
operating on his property.
   ``Even if they shot one million rabbits each, it would have
virtually no impact on the population,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, George Bush's
choice for White House chief of staff, met Wednesday with leaders of
the American Jewish community and sought to reassure them that he
sympathized with their interests.
   About 30 Jewish leaders met for two hours with Sununu, according
to the host, Long Island Realtor Jack Stein.
   ``It was a very positive meeting. It was the beginning of what we
hope will be a process of continuing dialogue to deal with questions
on the Jewish agenda,'' said Stein. ``The governor's point of view
on them was received well and there was a general wishing of success
and a promise of cooperation to him by the members present.''
   He said Sununu was asked about one issue that has caused
controversy _ Sununu's refusal to sign a pro-Israel proclamation in
1986.
   A Jewish group in Manchester, N.H., had asked Sununu to sign a
proclamation condemning a 1975 United Nations resolution equating
Zionism with racism. Sununu was the only governor in the nation to
refuse to sign.
   At Wednesday's meeting, Sununu reiterated that he had refused to
sign the proclamation because he felt it was wrong for a governor to
make pronouncements on foreign policy. And he repeated that he
opposed the U.N. resolution, according to Stein.
   Stein said Sununu also said he was committed to ``the integrity
and seurity of the state of Israel.'' And he assured the Jewish
leaders that the Bush administration will follow the lead of
previous administrations and assign a liaison to the Jewish
community.
   Stein was a special adviser to President Reagan and led the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations from
1971 to 1973.
   ``I wanted to assemble a representative group to introduce
Governor Sununu to the leaders of the Jewish community,'' he said.

   Grocers played ``musical turkeys''
Wednesday throughout the Northeast, giving customers fresh birds in
exchange for spoiled turkeys just in time for Thanksgiving dinner.
   Two of the country's largest turkey processors announced the
recall of 30,000 possibly spoiled turkeys, which set off a flurry of
last-minute telephone calls and trips to supermarkets from turkey
buyers.
   Norbest Inc., of Salt Lake City, recalled 20,000 fresh turkeys
distributed in eight states because some may have contained spoiled
giblets or necks, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday. Norbest
is the nation's fifth largest turkey processing and distributing
company.
   The turkeys were processed for Norbest in Columbia City, Ind.,
and were distributed in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Indiana,
officials said. No other Norbest products or frozen turkeys are
involved in the recall.
   Meanwhile, Giant Food supermarkets recalled 10,000 Shady Brook
Farms turkeys in the Baltimore and Washington areas for possible
spoilage.
   One truckload, which contained 1,800 turkeys, was shipped
improperly but the supermarket chain decided to recall 10,000
turkeys because they could not be certain where the bad birds were
sent, officials said.
   Bob Walsh, vice president of sales and marketing for Rocco
Enterprises Inc., parent company of the Harrisonburg, Va., turkey
producer, said only turkeys labeled Shady Brook Farms prime young
turkeys that were sold through Giant Food were being recalled.
   Grocers said they were inundated with calls.
   ``We've had phone calls like you would not believe,'' said Paula
Alward, bookkeeper for the IGA Foodliner in East Providence. She
said 10 to 15 fresh birds were brought back to the store.
   Although Norbest Inc. on Tuesday specifically recalled its
``Family Tradition'' fresh whole turkeys from stores, many customers
called with questions about their frozen Norbest turkeys, she said.
   Norbest recalled the fresh turkeys after three complaints from
grocers about spoiled necks and giblets in the birds. Company
spokesman Mike Korologos said Norbest has not received additional
complaints.
   Mike Ferry, manager of a Star Market store in Providence, said
many returned their Norbest turkeys.
   ``We're playing musical turkeys,'' Ferry said.
   The birds in question carry the USDA number of P-2487, which is
the federal number of Gobbler's Retreat Inc., a Columbia City, Ind.,
plant that processes the turkeys under a packaging agreement with
Norbest, Korlogos said.
   Gobbler's Retreat President Ralph Heine said he shipped turkeys
to Norbest and bagged his own under the Gobbler's Retreat label.
Officials said they did not know how the cause of the spoilage.
   Korologos said the suspected lot was about 0.2 percent of
Norbest's total production.
   But Wes Barter, president of Native Foods in Worcester, Mass.,
which distributed 3,000 of the turkeys in New England, said the
problem may change the public's perception of Norbest.
   ``There are people who will feel uncomfortable about serving a
turkey because it is a Norbest turkey,'' he said.
   In Maine, the only distributor of fresh Norbest turkeys, Wetterau
Food Distributors of Portland and Presque Isle, recalled all the
``several thousand'' turkeys in the affected lot, said Peter Kress,
spokesman for the state Agriculture Department.
   The Shady Brook Farms turkeys may have spoiled because they were
shipped from Harrisonburg on a truck that lost its refrigeration,
Walsh said. Rocco Turkeys is the nation's ninth-largest turkey
processor.
   Barry Scher, vice president of public affairs for Giant Food
supermarkets, said the company learned of the problem after several
customers returned their birds because of a bad odor.
   Shady Brook Farms spokesman Rick Chenoweth said checks at other
supermarket chains in the Baltimore-Washington area, New York and
New England have found no problems.

   The five remaining workers were ordered to go to Beirut and stay

<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department said Wednesday it
plans to require automakers to install shoulder harnesses for
rear-seat passengers in cars beginning with the 1990 model year.
   The action was announced only hours after a research group made
up primarily of trial lawyers criticized the department's highway
safety agency for not moving quickly enough on the issue.
   Critics for several years have raised questions about the degree
of safety provided by the lap belts alone. An estimated 150 million
cars have only lap belts in the rear.
   In some types of accidents, the lap-only configuration actually
contributed to the severity of some injuries, because of the
jack-knifing of bodies upon impact.
   Many automakers in recent years have begun providing the shoulder
belts in rear seats because of the mounting criticism and a string
of court cases that have stemmed from injuries sustained by
passengers wearing only lap belts.
   The proposed regulation, which is likely not to become final
until next year, applies only to new cars and does not address the
question of retrofitting automobiles now on the road.
   Shoulder harnesses now are required only for front-seat
occupants. Some auto manufacturers have offered retrofit kits for
the rear, but the kits are said to be difficult to find through auto
dealerships and relatively expensive.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part
of the Transportation Department, said the new rule, starting with
cars introduced next September, will also apply to small trucks,
convertibles, vans and utility vehicles a year later.

<TEXT>
   A judge ordered the head of the Church of
Scientology International jailed on Wednesday pending possible
indictment on charges of fraud, criminal association and tax evasion.
   Judge Jose Maria Vazquez Honrubia said it would be at least a
week before Heber Jentzsch of Los Angeles sees a second judge about
setting bail.
   He told reporters Jentzsch was being sent to Carabanchel Prison
outside Madrid and said the legal process could take months or even
years before it reaches trial.
   Vazquez Honrubia said authorities had frozen $1.76 million in
bank accounts belonging to officials of the U.S.-based Church of
Scientology and the church's drug rehabilitation program, Narconon.
   ``There is obvious and evident tax fraud here,'' the judge said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Bob Meade said Gerald Finn of Boston also
was jailed pending further investigation and two other Americans
were awaiting expulsion.
   Meade did not identify the two, but court records listed them as
Nancy Webcyk and William Tucker, believed to be husband and wife.
   Edith Buchele, a West German residing in Los Angeles, said the
organization would sue the judge immediately ``because his orders
are illegal.''
   She identified herself at a news conference earlier Wednesday as
chief officer in the church's Office of Special Affairs.
   Vazquez Honrubia ordered a police raid on an international
meeting in Madrid Sunday of members of the organization, following a
nine-month investigation into complaints by Spaniards that they had
been bilked.
   The judge told reporters after questioning all 71 people arrested
in the raid that 11 were jailed pending further investigation or
indictment; 10 were ordered expelled and 50 were released.
   He held a news conference in a room in Madrid's 21st District
Court filled with documents, computers and other equipment
confiscated during raids Sunday on offices of the church and
Narconon.
   Spanish television showed Jentzsch, a former Hollywood actor,
giving the V sign for victory in a court passageway during a break
in his questioning.
   Other foreigners ordered expelled included two Britons, two
Italians, one French, one Swiss, one Swede and one Dane, the
organization's attorney in Spain, Jose Luis Chamorro, said.
   Spain's Justice Ministry twice refused to grant the organization
legal status as a religious entity.
   ``Mr. Jentzsch has never been in Spain before, so how could he
have committed any crime,'' Ms. Buchele protested.
   She said, ``He (the judge) has listed no facts so far, and he has
not stated any crimes, either. The action ... has nothing to do with
justice but reminds us of the Spanish Inquisition.''
   The Church of Scientology, founded in the mid-1950s by American
science fiction author and former U.S. Navy officer L. Ron Hubbard,
has its European headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark.
   It has legal status in Britain and France and operates in other
European countries.
   The Narconon drug rehabilitation centers have come under attack
by critics who complain of high fees and unorthodox programs.
   ``One would assume the government would be interested in any form
of drug rehabilitation and any group'' that tries to solve the
problem, Ms. Buchele said.
   Heroin addiction is a serious problem in Spain, particularly
among 18-to-25-year-olds, 45 percent of whom are unemployed and
never held a job.
   Few officially sanctioned, medically supervised drug
rehabilitation centers operate in the country.
   ``The present attack can only come from those vested interests
who are making a lot of money out of drugs,'' Ms. Buchele charged.
   Several lawsuits are pending in the United States against the
church, involving its tax-exempt status and burglaries of offices of
the Internal Revenue Service.
   In Sweden, police are investigating 195 people who have defaulted
on loans totalling about $10 million believed to have been taken out
to finance Scientology courses.

<TEXT>
   Snow and heavy rain was on the menu Wednesday in the West,
threatening to hamper Thanksgiving travel.
   Snow fell at 2 to 3 inches per hour Wednesday over parts of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Yellowstone National Park
received 2 to 5 inches of snow overnight, with as much as a foot in
higher elevations.
   Rainfall was heavy over the Sierra Nevada foothills and valleys
of northern California with street flooding early Wednesday in
Sacramento.
   In Colorado, winds gusted to 80 mph west of Fort Collins. A 70
mph wind gust was reported southeast of Casper, Wyo.
   Heavy snow warnings remained in effect Wednesday over the Cascade
Range in Washington state and Oregon, for the Siskiyou Mountains of
Oregon and the Sierra Nevada in California and for high elevations
of parts of Nevada, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
   Tropical storm warnings were discontinued along the Florida and
Georgia coasts as tropical storm Keith, with 50 mph winds, moved
east-northeast into the Atlantic Ocean on a track that could bring
it near Bermuda in 36 hours.
   Much of the central and southern Plains had fair weather and
temperatures in the 50s and low 60s. North Platte, Neb., reached 69
degrees Wednesday, a record high for the date. The previous high was
67 degrees set in 1902.
   Temperatures from the northern Plains to New England were in the
30s and 40s. Readings over much of the Intermountain region and
Pacific Coast were in the 40s and 50s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 pm EST ranged from 28 degrees
at Limestone, Maine, to 80 degrees at Key West, Fla. The low in the
nation Wednesday morning was 3 degrees at Alamosa Colo.
   The forecast for Thanksgiving Day called for snow over the
northern and central Intermountain region and the northern and
central Rockies. Rain was expected across most of California and the
Pacific Northwest. Much of the eastern half of the nation was
expected to have mostly sunny skies.
   High temperatures were expected in the 20s and 30s over northern
New England; in the 30s for the northern and central Rockies, North
Dakota and eastern Montana; the 40s and 50s from the northern and
central Pacific Coast across much of Colorado, Nebraska, South
Dakota, the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, the Ohio
Valley, the central Appalachians, southern New England and the
middle Atlantic Coast; in the 80s over south central and southeast
Texas and southern parts of the Florida peninsula. Much of the
remainder of the nation was expected to have high temperatures in
the 60s or 70s.

<HEAD>Government Bill Proposes Charter for British Secret Service</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government bill Wednesday for the first time laid
out a charter for Britain's shadowy MI5 intelligence agency and
proposed a complaints tribunal, but stopped short of making the
service accountable to Parliament.
   Critics complained that MI5 remained the only secret service in a
major Western democracy shielded from independent scrutiny.
   MI5 was accused in recent years of infringing civil liberties by
tapping telephones of labor union leaders and anti-nuclear
campaigners.
   The Security Services Bill provides that MI5 agents will need a
Cabinet minister's warrant to bug a building or break into it. An
independent commissioner will monitor granting of warrants.
   The bill also provides for a tribunal of lawyers to hear
complaints from people who suspect they are targets of unwarranted
or improper surveillance.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government
meanwhile underscored its commitment to protecting the secrecy of
its undercover services by banning distribution in Britain of a U.S.
magazine that published a former agent's memoirs.
   The December issue of Harper's contains excerpts from the memoirs
of Anthony Cavendish, a former officer of MI6, MI5's sister service,
which the High Court banned British newspapers from publishing.
   Harper's publisher John MacArthur called the action ``government
tyranny and authoritarianism,'' the domestic news agency Press
Association said. It quoted him as saying the article contained
``nothing ... which could conceivably compromise national security.''
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said in presenting the bill in the
House of Commons: ``I can see there has been a gap in our
arrangements ... the absence of any way in which someone aggrieved
by an action of the service could have that grievance independently
investigated.''
   MI5 will still report in secret only to Hurd and Mrs. Thatcher,
not Parliament. ``The prime minister and I are accountable,'' said
Hurd, to jeers from opposition Labor Party legislators.
   Labor deputy leader Roy Hattersley described the bill as a
``small concession in response to the massive concern ... about the
uncontrolled, indeed sometimes unlawful, operations of the security
services.''
   The Thatcher government battled unsuccessfully for almost three
years to suppress ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of retired MI5
operative Peter Wright.
   Wright claimed MI5 agents ``bugged and burgled'' widely in the
1970s, tried to undermine Harold Wilson's Labor government and
plotted to assassinate Eyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
   Government officials denied the charter was spawned by the Wright
case. Hurd said the aim was partly to dispel ``some concern, as well
as misunderstanding'' about MI5's rules of operation.
   The 79-year-old service employs about 2,000 people but has never
has a basis in law. Until recently no British government would even
acknowledge its existence.
   Until now, agents have not needed individual warrants for
break-ins, operating under what one Home Office official called ``a
general directive from the Home Secretary.''
   The bill does not affect MI6, which gathers intelligence in
foreign countries and comes under the Foreign Office.
   Scandals increased pressure for some kind of parliamentary
control over MI5, similar to that imposed on the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency.
   In 1985, former MI5 employee Cathy Massiter charged publicly that
the agency tapped the telephones of labor union leaders on
instructions from Cabinet ministers, as well as phones of leaders of
the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
   She said MI5 agents kept tabs on officers of the National Council
for Civil Liberties.
   The bill stipulates that MI5's job is to protect ``national
security,'' particularly against terrorism, foreign spies and
sabotage.
   Some commentators saw the measure as an attempt to deflect
charges that the Thatcher government is excessively secretive. These
are building up round proposals to reform the catch-all Official
Secrets Act.
   The bill, to be published shortly, will make it a crime only to
divulge confidential information about defense, foreign affairs and
security, as opposed to all information as the present law
stipulates.
   But the measure will reinforce the lifetime gag on secret service
agents and deny civil servants the defense that they leaked
information in the public interest.

   A 6-year-old boy who survived a
car-train wreck that killed his parents and three of his sisters and
brothers walked three freezing miles in stocking feet to get help,
police said.
   Wayne Nelson was listed in good condition Wednesday at Mercy
Hospital in Valley City, said Deloris Welken, a nursing supervisor
in the hospital's emergency room. He was being treated for frostbite
on his feet.
   Arlynn Nelson, 41, and his wife, Theresa, 29, and children
Michael, 9; Michelle, 15 months, and Kelly, 6 weeks, were killed
Tuesday afternoon when a freight train smashed into the family car
at a fog-shrouded rural crossing five miles west of Valley City,
authorities said.
   Authorities said the train rolled for about a half-mile beyond
the crash site, and train crew members returned to the crossing
after Wayne had left to get help.
   Five-year-old Melinda Jo and 4-year-old Daniel also survived the
crash and remained hospitalized Wednesday. Daniel was also listed in
good condition at Mercy Hospital, while Melinda Jo was listed as
critical in St. Luke's Hospitals-MeritCare in Fargo, 60 miles east
of Valley City, according to hospital spokeswomen.
   No one on the westbound Burlington Northern train was injured,
said the state Highway Patrol.
   Wayne left the scene in search of help and walked three miles
north along the gravel county road to a farm, where he was
eventually discovered and help was summoned, Patrolman Roger Haga
said, at about 6:50 p.m. The temperature was in the mid-20s when the
accident occurred.
   The engineer of the westbound Burlington Northern train blew the
engine's whistle before crossing the intersection, Haga said. But
the area was shrouded in fog, and Arlynn Nelson, who was driving,
apparently did not see or hear the freight, Haga said.

   The Florida Supreme Court on Wednesday
ordered the state to withhold certification of a congressional race
that 10-term U.S. Rep. William Chappell Jr. had lost in a recount to
a political newcomer.
   Chappell was seeking to have the state Elections Canvassing
Commission invalidate nearly 11,000 votes cast in his home district
of Flagler County because they were filed late.
   The court ordered the delay until noon Wednesday to allow time to
consider the request.
   Republican Craig T. James of DeLand had been certified the winner
of the 4th Congressional District race earlier Tuesday. James won by
a recount by 732 votes in results certified by Gov. Bob Martinez and
two Cabinet members.
   The commission declared James the winner after deciding to accept
ballot box results from Flagler County, even though that county's
elections office did not submit its returns within a seven-day
deadline following the Nov. 8 general election.
   Chappell's petition said the canvassing board was barred by law
from accepting Flagler County's results because they were submitted
Nov. 17, two days after the deadline.
   The Florida Department of State, which oversees elections,
planned to fight Chappell's request because imposing the seven-day
deadline would mean disenfranchising the voters of Flagler County.
   ``We believe that the statute should not prohibit the people of
Flagler County having the results of their vote count,'' said Ken
Rouse, general counsel for the department. ``The Legislature did not
intend such a harsh result'' when it enacted the statute in 1951.
   James, who also was named by Chappell's lawsuit, called the
action a travesty.
   ``The votes were legitimate votes,'' James said, adding that he
was not concerned about losing. ``I'm sure the ultimate result will
be he'll get no relief from the Supreme Court.''
   Etta Peterson, supervisor of elections in Flagler County, called
for comment, was not in her office Wednesday afternoon, said Pat
Crook, an office worker.
   Her office had telephoned the results in time, but they were not
received in the mail until later, said Secretary of State Jim Smith,
who sits on the canvassing commission.
   Martinez, Smith and Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner, who
were all named in the petition, accepted the Flagler County results
after hearing an opinion from former state Chief Supreme Court
Justice Alan Sundberg, who said Flagler County residents should not
be denied their right to vote.

<HEAD>Dispute Over Baltic Autonomy Spreads Across Soviet Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The argument over Baltic demands for greater
autonomy spread across this vast nation Wednesday, attracting
official condemnation in two republics and a huge public rally of
support in a third.
   Government executive bodies in the Ukraine and Kazakhstan
condemned Estonia's declaration of independence from central
authority. Their action seemed to presage an official Kremlin rebuff.
   Activists in the free-wheeling southern republic of Georgia,
however, said up to 300,000 people gathered outside the legislature
demanding that the members condemn proposed amendments to the
national constitution they claim will strengthen central control.
   ``People demanded they refuse this project or separate from the
Soviet Union,'' Zviad Gamsachurdjia said in a telephone call from
Tbilisi, capital of Georgia. ``People are supporting Estonia,
Estonia's position.''
   Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, the three Baltic republics, want
greater economic, political and cultural autonomy as part of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for greater local control. But
they say Gorbachev's own constitutional amendments eliminate the
right to secede and strengthen central control rather than lessening
it.
   On Nov. 16, the Estonian legislature approved a ``declaration of
sovereignty'' in all areas except defense and foreign policy, along
with an amendment to the Estonian constitution giving the republic
the right to reject any new Soviet law.
   That posed a major challenge to Gorbachev _ how to continue his
reform program while keeping ethnic restiveness under control in 15
republics considered equal under the constitution.
   Gamsachurdjia said Georgian legislators protested new
constitutional provisions that end the right to secede and allow
Moscow to declare martial law in the republics. He added, however,
that the crowd outside found that inadequate.
   He said hundreds of people were conducting a hunger strike on the
steps of the legislature building.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said officials in the
Ukraine and Kazakhstan criticized Estonia's amendment.
   It quoted the executive body of the Kazakhstan legislature as
saying the action ``contradicts the norms of the Soviet
constitution, based on the principles of legislative organization
and the unity of the country, and weakens the economic basis of our
multinational government.''
   National Soviet media have said the Estonian declaration incites
ethnic unrest and accused populist People's Front organizations in
the Baltics of intimidating members of their legislatures.
   A commission of the national Supreme Soviet found Estonia's
legislation in violation of the Soviet constitution but there has
been no final word from Moscow on the question.
   Officials in Lithuania and Latvia managed to hold legislative
sessions without allowing a vote on similar proposals advocated by
the People's Fronts.
   Legislators in Armenia were to consider an amendment on the
Estonian model Tuesday, but their session was adjourned abruptly
because of increasing ethnic tensions in the Caucasus region.
Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan are involved in a territorial
dispute that has caused riots.
   In Riga, Latvia, the People's Front issued a call Wednesday for a
mass protest of the legislature's failure to vote on autonomy the
previous day.
   People's Front spokesman Janis Dinevich said by telephone that
about 25 officials of the organization met for five hours and
scheduled the protest for Saturday.
   ``People are very bitter that almost 1 million signatures went
without notice,'' he said.
   City officials rejected a request for a demonstration in downtown
Riga and suggested two outlying parks, he said, but the People's
Front had appealed to the Council of Ministers.
   He said the group expects about 100,000 people at the
demonstration.

<TEXT>
   Many income-conscious savers and investors have
had a rude introduction lately to a phenomenon known as ``takeover
event risk.''
   Until recently, owners of corporate bonds or bond mutual funds
had just two main perils to consider.
   The first was credit risk, the chance that an issuing company
might fall on hard times and find itself unable to pay interest on
schedule or repay the principal when its bonds matured.
   Credit risk can be minimized by limiting yourself to bonds of
top-quality companies, as measured by their credit ratings and
reputation, or by investing in a mutual fund with a widely
diversified bond portfolio.
   The second big question was market risk _ the possibility that
increases in inflation and interest rates would depress the market
value of all outstanding bonds. This concern could be mitigated if
you bought bonds with a firm intention to hold them to maturity,
when they would be paid off at face value.
   Now, thanks to the spreading popularity of leveraged buyouts,
there is a third hazard to consider.
   Even if a company is prospering and interest-rate conditions are
benign, its bonds can fall suddenly in value if a buyout is proposed
that would load the business down with new high-yield, or ``junk
bond'' debt.
   In the face of huge new buyout proposals lately for companies
such as RJR Nabisco, diversification within the corporate bond
market wasn't much help. Most corporate bonds fell amid the growing
perception of takeover risk.
   The investing institutions that dominate the bond market have
raised loud protests, and a few recent bond issuers have attached
provisions to their offerings providing holders with some protection
in the event of a buyout.
   In the meantime, what should individual investors do about this
situation?
   Avoiding takeover event risk is relatively simple _ put your
money in something other than corporate bonds where a takeover is
impossible or at least unlikely.
   ``Consider event risk, and suddenly predictability isn't boring
any more,'' declared one investment firm in an advertisement this
week touting securities of federal government agencies.
   U.S. Treasury securities are safest of all from takeover risk,
just as they are from credit risk. For mutual fund investors, there
are numerous funds that limit themselves to government securities.
   Analysts at Standard & Poor's Corp. point out that some types of
corporate bonds remain unlikely to be threatened by takeovers.
   ``Generally safe to buy are the bonds of the nation's largest
corporations _examples are IBM, Exxon and DuPont,'' S&P said in its
weekly publication The Outlook.
   Most banks and regulated utilities, while they may become
involved in other types of mergers, are also regarded as improbable
candidates for leveraged buyouts.
   If you want to switch money out of a corporate-bond investment to
something else not affected by buyout risk, S&P suggests you might
want to take action before yearend if your tax circumstances warrant
doing so.
   Any loss you realize can be used to offset capital gains you
might have to report.
   Beyond that, up to $3,000 in losses can be written off against
your other income. If your overall loss is greater than $3,000, the
balance is carried forward to future years.
   Assuming that the markets function the way they are supposed to,
corporate bonds that are most vulnerable to takeover event risk will
be priced in the future at levels that reflect that risk.
   The resulting high yields may prove attractive to investors
willing to gamble that no buyout will occur. But people whose prime
concern is safety will be advised to stay away.

<TEXT>
   A private research group on Wednesday charged
that the seat belts in a vast majority of cars are poorly designed
and don't provide full protection unless motorists adjust them to
fit tighter.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, meanwhile,
announced it will require shoulder harnesses in the rear seats of
all cars, effective in the 1990 model year starting next September.
   Both lap and shoulder harnesses are now required for front-seat
passengers, but only lap beats are legally necessary in the rear.
Many automakers have provided shoulder belts for all seats anyway,
especially in the wake of adverse court rulings on injury suits.
   On the separate design issue, the Institute for Injury Reduction
assailed the ``window shade'' feature that allows most belts to
loosen when a car occupant slowly shifts forward or sideways.
   This design, used in an estimated 120 million cars, including
virtually all U.S. car models built since the mid-1970s, often keeps
the belt resting some distance from the body, the institute said.
   Unless the shoulder restraint is manually tightened _ with a
slight tug forward on the belt _ its effectiveness in a crash may be
reduced significantly, Benjamin Kelley, president of the institute,
told a news conference.
   The institute, which was formed by a group of trial lawyers
involved in automobile accident litigation, called on the NHTSA to
eliminate the window shade design _ or short of that begin a
campaign to warn motorists about the alleged design flaw.
   But U.S. automakers contend there is no flaw at all _ and the
highway safety agency agrees.
   ``We have no evidence that window-shade (belt designs) are
defective or present a safety problem,'' NHTSA Administrator Diane
Steed said in a statement responding to the institute's charges.
   Auto manufacturers adopted the belt design in the mid-1970s and
they defend its use because, they said, it helps get people to
accept the belts. Motorists previously had objected to tight-fitting
belts as being too uncomfortable.
   ``The concept was to make the belts more user friendly so we
could get the percentages of (belt) users up,'' said Bill Peacock, a
spokesman for Ford Motor Co., who said the tension reliever _ or
window shade _ system cost Ford extra money.
   John Hartnett, a spokesman for General Motors Corp., called the
seat belt design ``an effective and comfortable seat belt system. It
encourages belt use.''
   Industry spokesmen as well as NHTSA officials acknowleged that if
the belts are to provide their best protection they should be worn
snugly. But they suggest the tradeoff in having belts that may be
slightly loosened is that fewer people will reject the belts
altogether.
   The window shade system is designed on a pendulum principal that
locks the belt tightly when the car decelerates suddenly, as in a
quick stop or an accident, while allowing the user to move normally
at other times.
   Kelley argued, however, that the belts sometimes stay loose after
the user shifts about.
   ``The (belt) slackness, which people often are not even aware of,
can result in horrendous injuries,'' he said, while claiming that
automakers have the technology available to develop belts that do
not loosen and still meet motorist acceptance.
   Kelley cited 1982 tests by NHTSA which compared the expected
injury in a 30 mph crash when belts have various amounts of slack.
   With 1 inch of belt slack, a test dummy sustained a head injury
level of about 50 percent greater than if there were no slack at
all; at 2 inches of slack the injury level was nearly twice as
severe; and with a full extension, or nearly 17 inches, it was about
4{ times as great.
   NHTSA officials acknowledged the test results, but noted that in
all the tests except for the one conducted with a full extension of
slack, the head injury levels remained below what would be
considered life threatening. With up to a 2-inch slack there was
``no signficant degradation of safety,'' said Barry Felrice,
associate adminstrator for rulemaking.
   The lawyer group also reiterated its complaint that only lap
belts are in rear seats of an estimated 150 million cars. They
suggested the belts may in some accidents actually cause serious
injury because of the jack-knifing of passengers without shoulder
belts.
   Within hours, the NHTSA announced the new requirement for
shoulder harnesses in the rear.
   The National Transportation Safety Board several years ago raised
a firestorm when it came to a similar conclusion after studying a
number of accidents. Since then many manufacturers have put
shoulder-harness belt systems in the rear seats.
   According to Peacock, about one-third of the 1989 Ford cars have
rear-seat shoulder belts. Hartnett said all 1989 GM model cars have
shoulder belts in both front and rear seats. Many imports have for
some time had such belts available for passengers in the rear.
   Nevertheless, complained Kelley, many older cars continue to have
lap-only belts in rear seats, exposing passengers to the danger of
sustaining serious abdominal or head injuries.
   NHTSA's Steed criticized Kelley and the lawyer group for
suggesting that in some cases passengers might be better off not
wearing a belt.
   ``No matter where you are sitting or what type of belt you have
available, wearing a belt is better than not wearing one,'' she said.

<HEAD>Broadcast Report: Grand Jury Wants To Know If Airline Sold Parts
To
Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury is investigating whether Aer
Lingus, the Irish airline, illegally shipped U.S. aircraft parts to
Iran during a six-year period, according to a broadcast report
Wednesday.
   The operation was discovered earlier this year when U.S. Customs
agents in Miami seized evidence during an investigation of another
aircraft firm, according to Wednesday's ``CBS Evening News''
television report.
   Since 1981, the airline is suspected of selling millions of
dollars of parts of C-130 planes to Iran, CBS said.
   A Justice Department source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that there was an investigation under way
but could not comment on its status.
   The parts helped Iran keep its C-130 fleet, built up during years
of peace with America, in good condition for the war with Iraq, CBS
said.
   Selling U.S.-made parts for the planes, which are used for many
purposes including supplying troops and refueling jet fighters in
flight, was made illegal after Iran seized U.S. hostages at the
Teheran embassy in 1979.
   CBS quoted law enforcement sources as saying the airline made a
huge profit by ordering parts for its own civilian version of the
C-130 and then illegally shipping them from London to Iran until
1987.
   CBS said Aer Lingus confirmed the investigation but refused to
comment.
   It also said the Irish embassy acknowledged that the Irish
ambassador visited the State Department last month to express his
government's concern about the case involving the private airline.
   If charged with illegally shipping the parts and then convicted,
Aer Lingus faces several million dollars in fines.
   CBS also reported that although an indictment is expected, the
State Department has expressed some reservations about bringing
charges against the national airline of a close ally.

   The six blacks saved from execution
Wednesday were convicted of complicity in the 1984 mob murder of a
black town councilor during anti-apartheid riots.
   No direct evidence emerged that the Sharpeville Six, as they
became known, directly contributed to the victim's death.
   Government leaders, churches and human rights groups around the
world had appealed for clemency for the five men and one woman.
   Black leaders warned that the hangings might provoke violence.
The slain councilman was killed during riotings that launched a
two-year outbreak of nationwide unrest over South Africa's system of
racial segregation, and hundreds died before it ended.
   Last March, Supreme Court Justice W.J. Human, who issued the
death sentences three years earlier, granted a four-week stay of
execution for the six two days before they were to be hanged at dawn
at Pretoria Central Prison.
   He said evidence had surfaced that a key prosecution witness had
perjured himself during the trial.
   But efforts to reopen the trial failed and President P.W. Botha,
who commuted the sentences Wednesday, was the last hope for the
condemned six.
   Human had based his decision on a defense application questioning
the reliability of testimony by prosecution witness Joseph Manete.
Human cited a May 11, 1985 statement in which Manete said police
forced him to identify two of the accused as having been at the
scene.
   Human said he was never made aware of that statement and,
therefore, did not allow the defense to cross-examine Manete on that
point.
   ``If Manete's statement had been available I would have allowed
cross-  examination,'' Human said.
   Botha had told black Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu then that
he would not intervene in the case and that only the finding of
significant new evidence could save the six.
   Both the trial court and the appeal court found no evidence that
the Sharpeville Six committed the murder.
   ``If ever there was a case for the state president to exercise
his discretion, and grant clemency, this is it,'' said defense
attorney Prakash Diar Diar in pleading that the lives of the six be
spared.
   The six were convicted in a non-jury trial by white judges under
the doctrine of ``common cause.'' That held that they were
responsible for the Sept. 3, 1984 death of Sharpeville Deputy Mayor
Jacob Dlamini because they were found to be part of a mob of 100
people who stoned and burned him to death at Sharpeville, 40 miles
south of Johannesburg.
   Black activists frequently targeted black township councilors,
considering them collaborators with the minority white-led
government. The Sharpeville riots were sparked by the local
council's decision to raise rents.
   President Reagan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain,
and President Richard von Weizsaecker of West Germany were among
world leaders who asked Botha to stop the hangings.
   The government's Information Ministry held news conferences in
Pretoria and Cape Town, showing reporters videotapes of similar mob
killings.
   Referring to appeals for clemency, Dave Steward, director of the
Bureau for Information, told reporters in Pretoria earlier in the
year that more than 700 black South Africans were burned to death by
fellow blacks after anti-apartheid violence and protests began in
1984.
   ``No emergency meetings of the United Nations Security Council
have been held regarding the hundreds who have been killed by mob
violence,'' he said then, adding there had been no international
expressions of sympathy for Dlamini.
   The Sharpeville Six are Mojalefa Sefatsa, Reid Mokoena, Oupa
Diniso, Duma Khumalo, Francis Mokgesi and Theresa Ramashamola. Ms.
Ramashamola is the only woman ever sentenced to death in South
Africa for what many considered a politically motivated offense.

   Americans flocked to airports, train and bus stations or took to
highways Wednesday on their Thanksgiving trek to friends and
families, while stay-at-homes defrosted turkeys and polished
silverware in readiness for the annual day of feasting, fellowship
and football.
   Airports from New York to Seattle braced for record numbers of
holiday fliers, but reported no problems at midday Wednesday.
Last-minute travelers, if they were lucky enough to get a ticket,
had an unwelcome surprise: higher air fares because of the
elimination of certain discounts.
   A blustery storm in the Northwest that spread rain and snow from
western Washington to northern California and eastward to Nevada
made driving hazardous but appeared to have little effect on air
travel. In Florida, Tropical Storm Keith moved out into the Atlantic
Ocean before the holiday travel crush began.
   ``The real rush hour will come after high noon, when hordes of
motorists will depart this vale of tears in Manhattan and head to
the hinterlands,'' predicted Victor Ross, spokesman for New York
City's Department of Transportation, hours before the rush hour.
``The roads will be jammed by veritable tidal waves of cars, like
lemmings marching to the sea.''
   He was right. His department declared a ``gridlock alert,''
cautioning drivers to expect delays. During the evening rush there
were tie-ups of up to two hours on the approaches to some bridge and
tunnel crossings.
   ``The Long Island Expressway is very long. More like a
crawlway,'' said Fred Feldman, traffic communication director for
the Transportation Department.
   Southbound traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike was clogged for
more than 30 miles from the George Washington Bridge. ``It's a
mess,'' said state trooper Edward Romanczuk, who called it the worst
holiday traffic he had ever seen.
   Some 29 million Americans will be traveling 100 miles or more
during the holiday weekend, according to a survey by the American
Automobile Association. The National Safety Council warned that 450
to 550 people may die in traffic accidents from 6 p.m. Wednesday to
midnight Sunday.
   Police in many areas said they were stepping up their patrols to
curb speeding and drunken driving, including a ``turkey watch'' in
the desert east and north of Los Angeles.
   Many families took close looks at their turkeys after two of the
nation's largest turkey processors recalled 30,000 birds in eight
eastern states, Washington, D.C., and Indiana. Grocers were
inundated with customers wanting to know if they had bad birds. Said
Mike Ferry, manager of a Star Market in Providence, R.I., ``We're
playing musical turkeys.''
   Other Americans concentrated on preparing holiday meals, for the
less fortunate as well as for themselves and their families.
   In Denver, 88-year-old ``Daddy Bruce'' Randolph, owner of Daddy
Bruce's Bar-B-Que, put the finishing touches on his annual
Thanksgiving dinner of turkey and ribs for 20,000 of the city's
needy. In Charlotte, N.C., employees at a Red Lobster restaurant got
a jump on the holiday by providing a covered-dish dinner Wednesday
for residents of several rest homes.
   Some 25,000 of Philadelphia's senior citizens and homeless also
got an early taste of Thanksgiving at Minnie Moore's dinner at the
Civic Center. Moore started serving people in her home about 20
years ago, and now she solicits donations throughout the year and
volunteers help with the serving and cleaning.
   In San Francisco, the Glide Memorial Church prepared to feed
7,000 homeless people, the most in its 15 years of serving
Thanksgiving dinners. The San Francisco AIDS Foundation planned for
a smaller crowd at its fifth annual Thanksgiving dinner. About 600
are expected at the dinner for people with AIDS and their families
and friends.
   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, accompanied by his
promoter, Don King, on Wednesday appeared at his church in an
impoverished Cleveland neighborhood to give away 500 free holiday
turkeys. ``I've just never been involved in anything like that,'' he
said after the giveaway.
   In New York, Mayor Edward I. Koch hammed it up Wednesday with
poultry king and Koch look-alike Frank Perdue, carving turkeys for
an early Thanksgiving dinner at the Prince George welfare hotel.
   But in Seattle, uncharitable thieves stole 1,300 pounds of ham
from a freezer outside the office of Strand Helpers, an agency that
helps the homeless.
   The loss, promised agency director Bob Willmott, won't disrupt
plans to offer free meals to 3,000 needy people. ``We're just going
to use some of the rent money and worry about it later,'' he said.
   In his Thanksgiving proclamation, President Reagan said: ``In
this year when we as a people enjoy the fruits of economic growth
and international cooperation, let us take time both to remember the
sacrifices that have made this harvest possible and the needs of
those who do not fully partake of its benefits. ... The gratitude
that fills our being must be tempered with compassion for the
needy.''
   The president and his wife, Nancy, are spending Thanksgiving at
their California ranch, and President-elect George Bush and his
wife, Barbara, headed Wednesday to their home at Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   Homebodies could look forward to televised parades in the
morning, particularly New York's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with
its giant balloons and Philadelphia's parade featuring floats,
balloons, soap opera stars and the 1989 Miss America. In the
afternoon were football games.
   At the nation's bus, train and air terminals, cheerful chaos
reigned Wednesday.
   ``It's getting busier by the minute,'' said Amalia Fernandez,
public information officer for the Dade County Aviation Department
which oversees Miami International Airport. About 25,000 more
passengers than usual are expected to pour through the airport
Wednesday _ 85,000 compared to 60,000 normally, said Fernandez.
   Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, one of the busiest in
the nation, could set a record Wednesday for the number of people
boarding airplanes, said spokesman John Braden. Last Thanksgiving,
about 99,000 passed through the airport, while Wednesday's bookings
total about 110,000, though not everyone will show up, he said.
   Despite the crowds, there were no problems, he said. ``There are
a lot of people going through, but as is typical during a holiday
period, they're in a good mood.''
   At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, officials expected more
than 40,000 passengers each day of the holiday, said Doug Holbrook,
superintendent of parking and ground transportation. About 30,000
people use the airport on a normal day.
   With heavy snow already falling in the Sierra Nevada, up to 10
inches was forecast for the mountains of Colorado.
   ``We like that,'' said Paula Sheridan, spokeswoman for Winter
Park-Mary Jane ski areas of Colorado. ``A foot of snow would be
dandy.''

<HEAD>Reagan Announces Veto of Ethics Bill</HEAD>

   President Reagan said Wednesday he
was vetoing a bill designed to clamp tighter limits on lobbying by
former federal employees because it was ``excessive and
discriminatory'' and would hamper the government's ability to
attract top-rate people.
   In a three-page memorandum explaining why he would allow a
bill-signing deadline to pass at midnight Friday, Reagan complained
that the legislation had been ``cobbled together'' by Congress in
its waning days and said it would have treated former employees of
the executive branch far more harshly than former members of
Congress and their senior staffs.
   The president said that in withholding his approval of the
Post-Employment Restrictions Act, ``I am well aware that there will
be criticism.''
   ``But I must act on this bill according to my judgment of what is
best for the country,'' he said in a ``memorandum of disapproval.''
Reagan invoked his constitutional authority to use the pocket veto _
to kill legislation by failing to sign legislation within 10 working
days from the time he received it when Congress is not in session.
   ``While this bill would not have affected me or my
administration, it is fundamentally flawed and would have made
securing good government for America substantially more difficult,''
Reagan said. ``This bill has good provisions, which I support, but
on the whole, it is flawed, excessive and discriminatory.''
   Reagan said he asked 20 Cabinet members and agency heads to
comment on the compromise legislation, which passed the Congress by
an overwhelming margin, and ``not one recommended approval.''
   He said it ``unreasonably favors Congress with restrictions
lighter than those that would apply to the executive branch.''
   Reagan remained secluded at his ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains
not far from this seaside resort city, and had no public appearances
scheduled until his return to Washington on Sunday.
   The bill, for the first time, would have barred former members of
Congress from lobbying their former colleagues for a year. However,
it would have imposed even stricter revolving-door rules on
executive branch employees, who already were covered by rules of the
1978 Ethics in Government Act.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the bill, for
example, would have barred ``contact by most White House staff and
executive level ... agency personnel with any executive in
government.''
   ``The result must be obvious,'' he said. ``Instead of extending a
welcome hand to talented people to spend time in government, this
provision says: `Warning: Government service may be hazardous to
your livelihood.''
   Reagan's prospective veto of the ethics bill drew fire from House
and Senate sponsors of the measure.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chief sponsor of the House version,
said the president's intended veto was ``an appalling act of
hypocrisy'' in view of George Bush's previous endorsement of even
tighter lobbying curbs contained in the Senate bill.
   ``This is the ultimate triumph of the Edwin Meese
ethics-schmethics approach to government, in which the rule is that
whatever makes everyone rich makes them happy,'' Frank said in a
telephone interview from Boston.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
co-sponsors of the Senate version of the bill, said they will resume
their fight for lobbying restrictions when the new Congress convenes
in January.
   Levin criticized Bush for endorsing the ethics bill during his
presidential campaign but failing to commit himself publicly when a
Reagan veto was being considered.
   Said Thurmond: ``The American people demand and deserve strict
ethical standards for government officials. We may have lost this
battle, but not the war.''
   Fred Wertheimer, president of the citizens lobby, Common Cause,
said in Washington: ``President Reagan's veto of the most important
ethics bill enacted by the 100th Congress has sealed the `anything
goes' ethics legacy of the Reagan administration and is an ominous
sign about the commitment of the incoming Bush administration to
honest and ethical government.''
   In advance of Reagan's announcement, Democratic Sen. George
Mitchell of Maine said in an interview on Cable News Network: ``I
would think that after all that has happened in this administration
_ Deaver, Nofziger, Meese _ all of the other things that have
happened in this administration, if there's any president that ought
to be enthusiastic about an ethics bill, it ought to be this
president.''
   However, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., defended Reagan's action.
He said Congress, in its ``rush to go on record as being against
corruption ... passed a piece of legislation that is overly broad
and one which cannot be understood by the very people whose conduct
it proscribes.''
   Fitzwater said President-elect George Bush discussed the
legislation with Reagan, but the spokesman would not say whether
Bush had recommended the veto.
   ``The vice president expressed his views to the president. We
honored the integrity of those views in a private manner,'' he said.
``But he did not recommend approval. Let's put it that way.''
   During a news conference Wednesday morning in Washington, Bush
said, ``I am going to have an ethics bill, and it'll be a strong
one. It'll be a fair one.''
   ``I think there is some recognition that the ... bill was a very
good start,'' he said. ``There were some changes in it that I guess
nobody's really totally happy with.''
   The bill was spurred at least in part by the wide-ranging ethics
problems experienced by Reagan administration officials.
   Former White House aides Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger have
been convicted of charges relating to lobbying activities they
carried out after leaving the administration.
   Asked if concern about the so-called sleaze factor played a role
in Reagan's decision, Fitzwater said, ``I think it's fair to say
that it did have an impact in the sense of making us very keenly
aware that our objections to this bill needed to be based on the
merits.''

   An investigator's report published
Wednesday says the chairman of a leading private bank stole or
misused more than $300 million in a widening scandal that has rocked
the government of Premier Andreas Papandreou.
   Spyros Papadatos, temporary commissioner appointed by the
government this month to investigate, reported that chairman George
Koskotas systematically ``siphoned about $135 million from the Bank
of Crete, which he passed through his own account.''
   His report said the 34-year-old Koskotas also used bank money to
make loans without collateral and give gifts to soccer clubs,
athletes, business associates, journalists and friends. It did not
say if any illegalities were involved in the loans and gifts
totaling $200 million.
   The socialist government has been accused of dragging its feet in
opening the investigation, and the ministers of public order and
justice have been forced to resign.
   Magazines and leading newspapers accused Papandreou's son George,
the minister of education, of being involved in financial dealings
with Koskotas and using his bank to illegally transfer money out of
Greece. The reports also named Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, who serves
as minister to the premier's office, and senior socialist party
officials.
   However, Wednesday's report did not accuse any political leaders
of wrongdoing.
   Koskotas has reportedly said he fled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
fearing for his life. He disappeared from Greece Nov.6 while under
police surveillance.
   Koskotas was suspended as chairman of the Bank of Crete last
month, and a government commissioner was appointed to investigate
the bank's financial dealings. Later, Koskotas was charged with
fraud and embezzlement.
   Greece and Brazil do not have mutual extradition agreements, but
the government said a warrant has been issued through Interpol, the
international police agency, for Koskotas' arrest.
   However, spokesman Paulo Marra of the Brazilian federal police
said his forces were searching for the banker because Greece asked
Brazilian authorities to locate, but not detain him.
   Under Brazilian law, Koskotas could be extradited to Greece only
by a special order of Brazil's Supreme Court.
   The commissioner's report said Koskotas used bank funds to build
up a publishing empire including five magazines and three national
daily papers. Later, he bought a controlling interest in a soccer
club.
   Koskotas gained control of the bank in 1984, two years after he
joined its accounting department.

   The California Supreme Court dismissed the
state's first ``clergy malpractice'' case Wednesday, ruling that a
church can't be held responsible for the suicide of a man who had
sought counseling.
   Groups representing more than 6,000 churches around the country
had written to the court in support of the church's position.
   The court unanimously threw out a lawsuit brought by the parents
of Kenneth Nally, 24, who shot himself to death in 1979 after years
of counseling at a fundamentalist church and one previous suicide
attempt.
   They were seeking $1 million from the Grace Community Church of
the Valley, contending the pastors who counseled him for several
years knew he was suicidal and should have sent him to a
psychiatrist, and that their method of counseling, which allegedly
stressed sin and guilt, worsened his depression and helped cause his
death.
   In a key portion of the ruling, the court ruled 5-2 that a church
counselor, or other non-professional counselor, has no legal duty to
refer a patient to a psychiatrist or take other steps to prevent
suicide.
   ``Neither the Legislature nor the courts have ever imposed a
legal obligation on persons to take affirmative steps to prevent the
suicide of one who is not under the care of a physician in a
hospital,'' said the opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas.
   Imposing legal duties on pastoral counselors would be
``impractical, and quite possibly unconstitutional,'' since those
duties ``would necessarily be intertwined with the religious
philosophy of the particular denomination,'' Lucas said.
   Nally, a former honor student and high school baseball star,
received counseling in 1978 and 1979 from several church counselors,
including pastor Richard Thomson.
   Nally took an overdose of antidepressant drugs in 1979 and was
hospitalized, telling two pastors the next day he was sorry he
hadn't killed himself.
   He was released the next week and saw several religious
counselors as well as a psychologist during the next few weeks; the
court said his parents resisted doctors' suggestions that he be
committed to a mental hospital.
   He was found dead in a friend's apartment.
   ``I'm surprised anybody would say they don't have a duty to save
a boy's life once they agree to be a suicide counselor for the
boy,'' said Edward Barker, a lawyer for the parents.
   Barker said he didn't know whether the ruling contained any
federal constitutional issues that could be appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   The 10,000-member Grace Community Church in the Los Angeles
suburb of Sun Valley is the largest Protestant church in Los Angeles
County, and includes on its staff counselors who advise parishioners
and non-members on spiritual and emotional problems, teach classes
and sell books and tapes on biblical counseling. The counseling is
free.

<TEXT>
   South Africa said Wednesday it
is ready for a formal signing of a regional peace accord in early
December, though it is still working out aspects of the U.S-brokered
pact with Cuba and Angola.
   The plan, endorsed by South Africa on Tuesday, calls for
withdrawal of the more than 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola. It also
provides for South Africa to set in motion a process for granting
independence to South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Cuba and Angola announced acceptance of the proposals last Friday.
   In his brief statement Wednesday, Foreign Minister Roelof Botha
gave no specific date for a signing ceremony, but said it would be
held in Brazzaville, Congo, which served as site of several rounds
of the peace talks.
   Botha said his country was still meeting with Angola and Cuba in
New York to work on ways of verifying the proposed Cuban pullout and
related issues.
   The plan, drafted by negotiators in Geneva last week, calls for a
phased withdrawal of the Cuban troops. They have been supporting
Angola's Marxist government in its war with rebels backed by South
Africa and the United States.
   No reports surfaced that the plan directly addresses the
13-year-old civil war. Washington says it will continue to support
the rebels.
   But sources have said the proposal calls for the Cubans to
withdraw over a 27-month period. The process leading to Namibian
independence would likely begin early next year, leading to
elections in August or September, the sources said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   About 9.5 million gallons of untreated
sewage flowed into New Bedford Harbor when the power failed at a
city sewage treatment plant, officials said Wednesday.
   The sewage spill forced the closing of 500 acres of shellfish
beds by the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, officials
said. About 8,000 acres of shellfish beds are now off limits due to
pollution.
   The outage began about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and lasted 14 hours,
affecting both the facility's main power line and its emergency
generator, said Mayor John K. Bullard.
   ``We had about 4 hours worth of storage capacity, so for about 10
hours we were discharging directly into Buzzards Bay,'' he said.
   The plant, built in 1970, has broken down frequently and ``is one
of the major lemons of the waste water treatment business,'' Bullard
said.
   The mayor said he has signed a consent decree with state and
federal authorities to have a second $200 million plant in place by
1994.
   Bullard said the state's tight finances and the federal
government's withdrawal from funding waste treatment is jeopardizing
completion of the new plant.

<HEAD>Currency Devalued, Prices Raised Under Peruvian Austerity Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Peruvians woke up Wednesday to find the price
of milk tripled, the cost of bread and rice doubled, and gasoline up
140 percent in the wake of tough, new government austerity measures.
   The price leaps followed Tuesday's announcement by the
center-left government of President Alan Garcia that it would
devalue the nation's currency by half and impose a host of other
belt-tightening measures. The program, intended to pull the nation
out of a severe recession, was the fourth emergency package adopted
this year.
   Opposition politicians said Wednesday the new package will not be
effective in ending the severe food shortages and labor strikes
stemming from the shrinking economy.
   Alfonso Barrantes, the former Marxist mayor of Lima and one of
the nation's most popular leaders, told foreign journalists, ``This
will be a hard blow to the poor and the middle class sectors of the
country.''
   Independent analyst Alejandro Toledo said the center-left
government of Alan Garcia ``must now pay the bill'' after financing
two years of economic growth with government subsidies.
   After taking office in July 1985, President Alan Garcia limited
payments on the nation's foreign debt and used funds Peru owed to
international banks to finance his economic recovery program.
   The economy grew by 8.5 percent in 1986 and 7 percent in 1987.
But Peru has exhausted its hard currency reserves, and the
government said the economy will shrink by at least 6 percent this
year.
   A similar austerity package announced in September _ including an
86 percent currency devaluation _ failed to slow inflation but
prompted widespread street protests and sporadic looting.
   For the past month, Peruvians have waited for hours in lines
several blocks long to buy daily rations of bread, sugar, rice and
other staples.
   Consumer prices rose 932.5 percent since January, and the 1988
annual inflation rate is expected to pass 1,200 percent. The
previous highest annual inflation rate was 158 percent in 1985.
   Finance Minister Abel Salinas, who announced the latest program,
said the currency devaluation of 50 percent, which will drop the
value of the inti from 250 to 500 intis to the dollar, will restrict
imports and boost exports.
   The price increases pushed milk from 96 intis a pint to 250, rice
from 60 intis a kilogram (2.2 pounds) to 120, and bread from 3.80
intis a roll to 10. A gallon of gasoline rose to 600 intis, or $1.20.
   The austerity measures include a wage increase of about 50
percent for most government workers. The purpose of the increase is
to help workers cope with increased prices.
   Salinas said the government will eliminate subsidies for basic
food products in stages over the next six months because it lacks
the money to finance them.

<HEAD>Two Dead In Guerrilla Bomb Attack On Police Station</HEAD>

   Guerrillas set off a car bomb at
a village police station Wednesday night, killing two civilians in a
passing car and injuring eight others, police reported.
   A press officer at Belfast police headquarters, who in accordance
with British practice cannot be identified, said the bomb was
concealed in a van left near the police station. The building was
unstaffed and locked up at the time.
   The attack occurred at Benburb in County Tyrone 35 miles west of
Belfast.
   An unidentified resident told the Press Association, a British
news agency, that she heard ``an unmerciful bang.''
   ``All our windows were blown out,'' she said. ``My father was in
bed upstairs and the glass just came in on top of him. Thank God
none of us were hurt.''
   The agency quoted an unidentified witness as saying the explosion
blew the car with the two victims off the road and into a nearby
field.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility. Even though the two
dead civilians were Roman Catholics, suspicion fell on the mainly
Catholic Irish Republican Army.
   The IRA, which wants to end British rule of Northern Ireland, is
fighting to unite the mostly Protestant province with the Republic
of Ireland, which is 95 percent Catholic.
   The police spokesman said the van had been stolen in the mainly
Catholic town of Coalisland eight miles away. He said the family
that owned it was held at gunpoint by one guerrilla group, while
others drove the vehicle to its target.
   The family was afterwards released unharmed, he said.
   He said the two civilians killed were a man and a young girl,
both Roman Catholics.
   Press Association said the victims were believed to come from the
neighbouring village of Blackwatertown. No other details were
immediately available on the victims.
   The eight injured civilians were taken to South Tyrone Hospital
at the town of Dungannon about five miles away. Police said none was
seriously injured.
   The explosion caused extensive damage to the police station and
up to 12 nearby homes, police said.
   The British news service said the guerrillas gave a warning that
the bomb was about to go off. But it said warning came too late for
security forces to evacuate the area or even close the main street
through the village.
   The bombing of the police station is the latest in a series of
renewed guerrilla attacks in recent weeks.
   Guerrillas launched a wave of attacks earlier this year against
British forces in Northern Ireland, mainland Britain and continental
Europe, but the tempo of attacks slackened for a time.
   Earlier Wednesday, guerrillas lobbed two grenades at workers who
had been repairing a courthouse in Dungannon damaged in an earlier
bombing. Nobody was reported injured in Wednesday's grenade attack.
   On Tuesday night, guerrillas fired a rocket-propelled grenade at
two police jeeps at Castlewellan 25 miles south of Belfast. They
missed and demolished a butcher shop instead.

<HEAD>Former Klan Member Gets Six Months In Decatur Confrontation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Ku Klux Klansman described by a
prosecutor as ``a field marshal in the streets'' during a battle
between Klansmen and civil rights marchers more than nine years ago
has been sentenced to six months in prison.
   In sentencing Ricky Lynn Creekmore, U.S. District Judge Sam C.
Pointer Jr. said Tuesday that the punishment might discourage
members of other groups from contemplating violence.
   The judge said that Creekmore took a substantial role in the
melee March 26, 1979 in Decatur, about 70 miles north of Birmingham.
   Creekmore, convicted of a misdemeanor of conspiring to deprive
marchers of their rights, has a request before the U.S. Supreme
Court to review the case. Pointer set Feb. 9 as the date for
Creekmore to report to prison but said that could be postponed if
the Supreme Court has not acted by then.
   Photographs of the battle in Decatur show Creekmore, wearing an
``Invisible Empire of the Ku Klux Klan'' T-shirt, swinging a
baseball bat and a tree limb at blacks and at police trying to keep
the two groups apart.
   Al Moskowitz, a Justice Department prosecutor, said that although
Creekmore could not be called the mastermind of the Klan's alleged
conspiracy to disrupt the march, ``it can be said he was a field
marshal in the streets.''
   Moskowitz asked for the maximum sentence of one year in prison.
   Creekmore's attorney, Don Colee, asked Pointer to put his client
on probation, saying that ``Rick's not proud of what he did back in
'79 and '80.''
   Since 1981, Creekmore has married and adopted his wife's two
children, Colee said.
   Two months ago, Klansman David Lee Kelso, another of eight Klan
members indicted in the case, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge,
and Pointer sentenced him to two years probation after suspending a
one-year prison sentence.
   In 1986, U.S. District Judge William Acker sentenced Derane
O'Neill Godfrey to a year and a day in prison after he pleaded
guilty.
   Other Klan defendants are to stand trial next year, but have
appeals of evidence-suppression rulings pending. The violence
occurred as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference led a march
protesting the prosecution of a mentally retarded black man accused
of raping a white woman.

   The body of Christina Onassis was
sent home Wednesday for burial on the family's Greek island, but her
housekeeper was kept behind until she answered questions by
investigators into the cause of death.
   Heleni Syros, the housekeeper, apparently was the person who
discovered Ms. Onassis lying on the floor Saturday at the home of
friends. An investigating judge said Ms. Syros acknowledged moving
the body, but he gave no details.
   A preliminary coroner's report said the 37-year-old shipping
heiress died of a fluid buildup in the lungs.
   Legal and medical officials want to establish whether it resulted
from natural causes, such as a heart attack. The complete coroner's
report is expected in about two weeks.
   The daily La Nacion quoted an unidentified doctor in the
coroner's office as saying ``Death could have been produced by a
heart weakened by the prolonged ingestion of slimming medication.''
   Ms. Onassis frequently dieted to combat a weight problem and was
known to take diet pills.
   Federal Judge Alberto Piotti formally released of the body at
about 2 p.m. Wednesday as a group of family members and friends
waited with the casket at Ezeiza International Airport.
   Aides to Piotti said release authorization was granted, as
requested Tuesday night by Interior Minister Enrique Nosiglia,
because forensic experts said autopsy evidence indicated the body
would not have to be examined again.
   Ms. Onassis is to be buried Saturday on the island of Skorpios in
a mausoleum next to her father, Aristotle, from whom she inherited
$500 million after his death 1975, and her brother Alexander.
   Piotti said in a telephone interview that Ms. Syros answered
questions from himself and Judge Martin Trurzun late Wednesday
afternoon, adding that she could have left on the plane with the
rest of the Onassis group had she responded to their request earlier.
   He said the housekeeper acknowleged she moved Ms. Onassis' body
from the bathroom to the hallway. He declined to comment on the
significance of her remark or disclose other questions and answers
in the interview.
   The first doctor on the scene at Tortuguitas Country Club, 25
miles north of Buenos Aires, told police Ms. Onassis was dead when
he arrived and her body apparently had been dragged from one room to
another.
   Ms. Onassis was staying with Alberto and Marina Dodero in Buenos
Aires. They accompanied the casket, as did the dead woman's former
husband, French industrialist Thierry Roussel.

   Outgunned and outmanned by international drug
dealers, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials lamented
Wednesday that three of their own may have gone bad, but vowed to
end corruption and continue the war on drugs.
   ``We are not naive. We realized that tragic situations like this
can occur,'' said John Zienter, agent-in-charge of the DEA's office
here.
   It has been an especially rough year for the Los Angeles DEA. In
February, agents Paul Seema, 52, and George Montoya, 34, were shot
to death and agent Jose Martinez, 25, was wounded during an
undercover drug operation in Pasadena. Two of the drug dealers were
killed and a third was wounded.
   On Tuesday, three former Los Angeles DEA agents were charged with
laundering more than $608,000 _ apparently accumulated while dealing
in the narcotics trade, authorities said.
   By Wednesday, Zienter and agents tried to overcome the bad news
of the previous day by focusing attention on their latest weapon in
the drug war, a Colt 9mm submachine gun to help combat drug runners'
automatic weapons.
   Zienter said the new weapons are necessary because of ``the
tremendous danger involved in the narcotics business and enforcing
narcotics laws.''
   Reporters wanted to know what made three law enforcement officers
sworn to fight crime allegedly decide to join forces with the
criminals instead.
   ``It certainly makes good police officers sick,'' Zienter said.
   Former DEA agents John Jackson, 39, of Claremont and Wayne
Countryman, 45, of Walnut were arrested Tuesday and arraigned on a
charge of conspiring to defraud the United States by obstructing the
duties of the Internal Revenue Service.
   The third ex-agent, Darnell Garcia, 41, of Rancho Palos Verdes,
remained at large. Authorities believe he may have fled to Madrid.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner said the three are charged with
conspiracy to launder the cash and transferring the funds to
Switzerland. They are accused of allegedly hiding unreported income
by transferring U.S. currency to Switzerland between 1984 and 1987.
   Internal Revenue Service agent John Anderson said the
investigation ``uncovered evidence that supported the allegation
that the three former DEA agents were involved in money laundering
and narcotics trafficking during and following their employment as
special agents.''
   The affidavit was filed in support of a search of Garcia's Rancho
Palos Verdes home. The affidavit stated Garcia bought a home in 1987
for $580,000, paid for in full. Jackson bought one in 1988 for
$750,000, the affidavit stated.
   The 22-page affidavit unsealed Wednesday included witness
statements saying that two narcotics traffickers who are fugitives
from Detroit frequented an apartment that Garcia rented in Los
Angeles. The affidavit also detailed numerous trips to Europe in
which the former agents allegedly bought cashier's checks made
payable to Swiss banks.
   Bonner and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joyce A. Karlin refused to
disclose any details about the source of the money, but Bonner said
``the corrupting effects of drug trafficking'' was to blame. Zienter
refused to discuss the case.
   Mary McMenimen, spokeswoman for Bonner's office, said the
investigation is continuing to determine if others were involved in
the corruption.
   DEA chief John Lawn in Washington issued a statement saying the
charges ``reveals the integrity'' of the agency's internal policing
mechanisms.
   ``While three former employees have been charged, the focus
should remain on those DEA men and women who risk their lives daily
to enforce the law against anyone who violates the law,'' Lawn said.
   Jackson, who prosecutor Karlin claims has associated with drug
kingpins, was ordered held without bail and Countryman was released
on $120,000 bail late Tuesday.
   If convicted of the conspiracy charge, each defendant would face
a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools Chancellor Richard Green on Wednesday
suspended all eight members of a Bronx school board after disclosure
of an investigation of alleged theft and drug use among its members.
   Bronx District Attorney Paul Gentile said at a Wednesday news
conference that Community Board 9 in the Bronx was ``the focal
point'' of a grand jury probe into the activities of Bronx community
school boards.
   ``It is far more extensive than has been previously reported,''
Gentile said of allegations of board wrongdoing. He refused to give
details of specific allegations raised in published reports.
   Green called the suspension of the members of Community Board 9
an unusual step, but said it was necessary because of the
investigation and the recent arrest of a principal who worked in the
district on drug charges.
   ``I do not by suspending them allege that they are guilty of
anything,'' he said. ``I would hope the due process works in their
behalf.''
   Gentile said investigators from his office, city police and
members of the Board of Education's inspector general's office are
conducting the probe. He said it will cover:
   _ The alleged use and distribution of drugs by school board
members and their subordinates.
   _ The alleged extortion of money under the guise of fund raising
for school board members running for re-election.
   _ Whether principalships, assistant principal jobs and other
posts under the control of the school board are being sold, or if
the jobs are being awarded on a patronage basis.
   _ How school custodians operate after-school programs and if they
have been accepting money to keep schools open illegally or failed
to report alleged drug parties.
   _ The buying and handling of school equipment, specifically
computers, word processors and furniture and whether it ends up in
the schools or in someone's house.
   Green announced the suspensions at a news conference after he met
for two hours with the members of Community Board 9.
   He said their suspensions were indefinite, but that they could
appeal to the central Board of Education and that they probably
would be eligible to be candidates in at the next school board
election in May.
   Suspended board member Carmelo Saez also addressed the news
conference and said the suspensions were unfair because they had not
been accused of wrongdoing. He denied that board members had used
drugs or misappropriated school equipment.
   Green said he has appointed four trustees to oversee the business
of Community Board 9. The trustees are two Bronx lawyers and two
Board of Education employees.
   The Village Voice, in its latest issue released Wednesday,
detailed allegations of drug use by several board members at regular
Friday night gatherings at P.S. 64 over the past two years.
   The New York Times, New York Post, The Daily News and New York
Newsday contained similar charges.
   The published reports included accounts of school equipment
allegedly being sold to support board members' drug habits and
charges that principal's jobs were sold for as much as $10,000.
   The reports also said teachers and district employees were often
pressured into buying fund-raising tickets for board members running
for reelection.
   Curtis Johnson, head of Community School Board 9, was not in the
office Wednesday and could not be reached for comment.
   The city's school system, which has some 900,000 students, has 32
decentralized school districts. The Board of Education sets
curriculum and general policy but the districts are responsible for
day-to-day operations.
   Board members, who are elected to their post and are paid a
modest stipend of about $100 a month, are responsible for appointing
principals, assistant principals and district superintendents.
   District 9 has about 26,000 students in 34 schools in the
predominately black and Hispanic South Bronx.
   Gentile said a grand jury has been investigating the matter for
some time, but ``no indictments are expected any time soon.''
   He said since the arrest of P.S. 53 principal Matthew Barnwell on
cocaine charges Nov. 3, his office has been flooded with calls about
abuses in the system.

   Maoist guerrillas ambushed two military trucks
in Peru's cocaine-producing jungle territory, killing or wounding at
least 16 soldiers, officials said Wednesday. Police in a nearby city
said the ambush killed 22 soldiers.
   Guerrillas from the Shining Path movement also assassinated a
government official in a port city and blew up two bridges on the
nation's most important railroad, police said. The rail attack cut
links between the mineral-producing Andean highlands and Lima, the
capital.
   The attacks followed an upsurge in guerrilla violence that left
at least 41 other people dead since Saturday, including rebels,
police, troops and civilians.
   A top anti-insurgency official in the government told The
Associated Press 16 soldiers were killed or wounded when rebels
ambushed two truck loaded with troops Tuesday near Aucayacu, 220
miles northeast of Lima.
   But police in Tingo Maria told reporters 22 soldiers were killed.
   The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said he had no information about rebel casualties.
   Aucayacu lies in the Upper Huallaga Valley, the heart of Peru's
illicit cocaine trade. The region is under direct military control
under a state of emergency imposed more than a year ago to fight
drug traffickers and the heavily armed guerrillas who safeguard the
drug flow.
   Rebels killed Carlos Soto, deputy administrator of Pisco, by
cutting his throat before dawn Wednesday as he slept in his home
there, police said. Pisco is a fishing port 120 miles south of Lima.
   Soto, a member of the governing center-left Aprista Party,
controlled police forces in the area.
   No one was injured in the bridge attacks, which occurred around
midnight Tuesday.
   The national railroad company Enafer said service was suspended
on freight and passenger trains running between coastal Lima and the
mountain city of Huancayo, 130 miles east, until the bridges could
be repaired next week.
   The Shining Path has been fighting since May 1980 to impose
Marxist rule. Violence has claimed more than 12,000 lives and caused
damage of more than $10 billion, according to government figures.

   Gunmen surrounded a church in a
mountain village and opened fire, killing 17 worshippers inside and
injuring nine, the military said Thursday.
   The government news agency said the dead included at least three
children under 9 years and five women.
   Lt. Col. Jose Ayap, a military command spokesman, blamed
communist rebels for the attack late Tuesday on Cebu Island near the
town of Asturias, 340 miles southeast of Manila. He said
investigators were unsure of the motive.
   The government-run Philippines News Agency quoted a survivor,
Feliciano Yongco, as saying villagers were gathered in the church
for evening prayers when armed men surrounded the building and
opened fire.
   Yongco said the attackers also sprayed a nearby home with
automatic gunfire before fleeing into the hills, the agency said.
   The news agency said survivors were to be airlifted later
Thursday to a hospital in Cebu City, 40 miles away.
   Both New People's Army guerrillas and government-backed
anti-communist vigilantes are active on Cebu Island. The communist
rebels have been waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a Marxist
state.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha commuted
the death sentences Wednesday of the Sharpeville Six, who were
convicted in a 1984 riot that marked the start of two years of
nationwide unrest.
   The attorney for another man, whose case is similar to the
Sharpeville Six, said the justice minister stayed his client's
execution early Thursday, just hours before he was to hang.
   The Justice Ministry said the six blacks _ five men and a woman _
will serve prison terms ranging from 18 to 25 years. The death
sentences in 1985 caused worldwide protest.
   Botha's announcement came hours after the Appeal Court in
Bloemfontein, the nation's highest tribunal, unanimously rejected a
petition to reopen the trial.
   The Sharpeville Six were convicted of murder in connection with
the September 1984 killing of black town councilor Kuzwayo Dlamini
by a mob in Sharpeville, a township south of Johannesburg.
   No evidence was presented that they contributed physically to his
death. They were convicted under the common purpose doctrine, on
grounds of being active participants in the mob that killed Dlamini
during rent riots.
   Jack Viviers, a spokesman for Botha, refused comment when reached
by The Associated Press and the Justice Ministry gave no reason for
the president's action.
   Botha also commuted the death sentences of four white policemen
and three black men, all of whom had been sentenced to hang for
murder convictions, the Justice Ministry said. They will serve terms
ranging from 15 years to 25 years.
   Prakash Diar, lawyer for the Sharpeville Six, said: ``I think the
state president might have underestimated the international pressure.
   ``Very important heads of state ... have personally intervened on
their behalf and I think that has made a difference,'' Diar said. He
named President Reagan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany among those who
interceded on behalf of the Sharpeville Six.
   ``I am happy for my clients that the state president has sought
to reprieve them, but I am astonished at the number of years they
are going to be spending in prison.''
   Diar said after Wednesday's court ruling that only Botha's
intervention could save his clients. The president turned down a
previous clemency request but said he would consider the matter
again ``as a human being'' once the judicial process was complete.
   Hassie Mokgesi, father of Sharpeville Six defendant Francis
Mokgesi, said, ``They should have decided to let the boys come
home.''
   Anti-apartheid groups in South Africa, international human rights
organizations and numerous foreign governments had urged Botha to
grant clemency to the Sharpeville Six.
   The U.S. Embassy issued a statement saying of Botha: ``By
choosing to commute these death sentences he has acted in the
interests of South Africa as a whole.''
   In London, a spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office praised
Botha's decision to commute the death sentences, saying it was
``news that we welcome very much.''
   The Sharpeville Six are: Mokgesi, 31; Reid Mokoena, 24; Oupa
Moses Diniso, 32; Duma Joshua Khumlao, 28; Reginald Sefatsa, 32; and
Theresa Ramashamola, 27.
   The group, convicted in 1985, had spent 1,076 days on Death Row.
   The riots in Sharpeville and neighboring townships marked the
start of more than two years of nationwide black unrest. Activists
frequently targeted township councilors for attack, saying they were
collaborators with the white-led government and its apartheid
policies of racial segregation.
   Two of the policemen who received clemency Wednesday, Leon de
Villiers and Patrick Goosen, were convicted of fatally shooting a
black youth in the Eastern Cape province after severely beating him.
The attack took place after an all-night drinking bout by the two
men and other members of their unit.
   The other two policemen, Johannesburg officers Jack LaGrange and
Robert van der Merwe, were convicted of carrying out the hired
killings of two suspected drug dealers in the Soweto township
outside Johannesburg.
   Attorney Roshan Dehal said Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee granted
an indefinite stay of execution to his client, Paul Setlaba, who was
scheduled to hang Thursday morning, the independent South Africa
Press Association reported.
   The 23-year-old Setlaba, a black, was convicted of murder with
two younger defendants under the doctrine of common purpose in a
1985 killing during a consumer boycott.
   The Appeal Court on Wednesday rejected a last-minute appeal by
Setlaba.
   The stay came shortly after the U.N. Security Council urged South
Africa to halt the hanging, said United Nations spokesman Francois
Giuliani in New York. He said U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar earlier had made a personal appeal to Botha for clemency for
Setlaba.
   Six other people were scheduled to hang Thursday morning.
   So far this year, 110 people, including three whites, have been
hanged in South Africa.

<HEAD>Britain Calls World Talks On Damage To Ozone Layer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is calling an
international conference in London in March on the risks to the
world's ozone layer from man-made chemicals, an official said
Wednesday.
   Every country in the world will be urged to attend, Environment
Secretary Nicholas Ridley told a news conference.
   He said the aim of the meeting is to warn developing countries of
the dangers of producing chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs.
   Britain and its partners in the 12-nation European Economic
Community, along with 23 other countries signed the 1987 Montreal
Protocol, which calls for production of CFCs to be cut by 50 percent
of the 1986 levels by the end of the century. The protocol comes
into force on New Year's Day.
   CFCs are used for propellants in aerosol sprays and in making
refrigerators, firefighting equipment, disposable food cartons,
plastic foam for insulation and in chemical cleaners in the computer
industry.
   The United States, Canada, Scandinavian countries and the Soviet
Union have banned their use as propellants.
   Some scientists say CFCs are destroying the ozone layer of
protective gases around the Earth which prevents the sun's harmful
ultraviolet rays from reaching the surface. The rays are known to
cause cancer.
   CFCs are one of the ``greenhouse gases,'' which include carbon
dioxide produced by burning coal and oil and which threaten to
progressively warm up the atmosphere so as to melt the polar ice
caps, raise sea level and change the climate.
   Ridley said he will visit China Dec. 10 to persuade the Chinese
to take part in the meeting.
   ``A clear commitment is needed from all world governments,
including those who have not yet signed the protocol, if we are to
have any chance of preventing further damage to the ozone layer. It
is not enough to set objectives. Our London conference must show how
they will be achieved in practice,'' Ridley said.
   Ridley said Britain wants the global emission of CFCs to be
reduced by at least 85 percent as soon as possible.
   ``I am convinced of this urgent need by the latest scientific
evidence,'' he added.
   The London-based Friends of the Earth environmental group issued
a statement hailing the new initiative.

   A psychiatrist examined accused murderer Joel
Steinberg Wednesday to prepare for a possible switch from an
innocent plea to an insanity defense in the beating death of his
adopted 6-year-old daughter, sources said.
   However, legal restrictions on such pleas make it unlikely that
state Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax will allow the switch
this far into the month-old trial.
   Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, is charged with second-degree
murder in Lisa Steinberg's death. The bruised and battered child was
removed unconscious from Steinberg's apartment on Nov. 2, 1987. She
died three days later.
   He says she fell unconscious after choking on food she had
vomited and that the bruises on her chest and back resulted from his
trying to revive her.
   Steinberg, 47, was seen by ``one of the city's most prominent
forensic psychiatrists'' in a room at the state Supreme Court
building in the borough of Queens, the sources said.
   Steinberg's lawyers, Ira London and Adrian DiLuzio, want the
psychiatrist, whose name was withheld, to try to explain the
defendant's ``flat emotional affect'' after he allegedly beat the
child to death.
   Witnesses, including police officers, paramedics and St.
Vincent's Hospital doctors and nurses have testified that Steinberg
seemed unconcerned and made inappropriate comments while the child
lay bruised and comatose.
   Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's longtime live-in companion, told a
hospital psychiatrist that Steinberg acted strangely and made
bizarre comments after the child fell unconscious.
   The law requires that a defendant notify the court within 30 days
of indictment if he intends to put forth a defense of mental disease
or defect.

   France on Thursday conducted its
seventh nuclear test this year on Mururoa Atoll in the South
Pacific, scientists in New Zealand said.
   The explosion measured about 40 kilotons, the equivalent of
setting off 40,000 tons of TNT, said Warwick Smith, superintendent
of the Seismological Observatory.
   He said the blast, monitored in Raratonga, Cook Islands, was the
102nd on Mururoa Atoll since France began underground testing there
in 1975.
   Smith said the explosion was recorded at 7:01 a.m. (4:01 p.m. EST
Wednesday). France on average conducts eight nuclear tests a year.
There already have been two tests this month.

   A man who hit a $1.1 million jackpot on a slot
machine at Caesars Palace can't keep the money because he wasn't old
enough to gamble legally, a state agency ruled Wednesday.
   Kirk Erickson, 19, of Royal, Ark., won the money Aug. 5, but the
jackpot was denied because he wasn't 21.
   Erickson appealed to the state Gaming Control Board, which upheld
the decision.
   ``It would be an unreasonable, if not absurd, result to construe
the statute to prohibit a person under 21 years of age ... from
placing wagers on other games and slot machines, but not to prohibit
this same person from collecting winnings,'' the board said.
   The decision has no effect on the $21 million lawsuit Erickson's
family filed against the resort seeking both the jackpot and damages.

<HEAD>Air Line Pilots Ask For 727 Modification</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Line Pilots Association said Wednesday its
probe of a Delta jetliner crash at Dallas in August has prompted it
to seek an emergency modification in takeoff warning systems of all
Boeing 727 jetliners.
   The union, which represents commercial jet flight crews, said it
had found a ``serious deficiency'' in the lack of an inboard wing
flap position sensor for the stall warning system on 727s.
   Salt Lake City-bound Delta Flight 1141 crashed and burned while
taking off from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Aug. 31,
killing 14 of the 108 on board the Boeing 727.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said that while Flight
1141 had no problems as it rolled down the runway, it encountered
almost immediate trouble after liftoff and rolled violently from
left to right before crashing.
   As part of its investigation into the crash, the NTSB has studied
whether the takeoff warning system alarm failed on the Delta flight.
The alarm is designed to sound if a pilot has not prepared an
aircraft properly for takeoff, such as leaving wing flaps, which
help give a plane lift, in the wrong position.
   The ALPA on Wednesday released a letter to LeRoy A. Keith,
manager of the FAA's Aircraft Certification Division in Seattle,
from Harold F. Marthinsen, director of ALPA's Accident Investigation
Department.
   In it, Marthisen noted that the flap position sensor on a 727 is
located on the outboard wing flap, but not on the inboard flap.
   If the outboard flaps were properly extended for takeoff, but the
inboard flaps were still retracted, Marthisen said the warning alarm
would not sound.
   ``While the NTSB has yet to explore this possible explanation for
the accident, the Air Line Pilots Assocation accident investigators
feel strongly that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that
such a condition did exist on the accident aircraft,'' Marthisen
wrote.
   ``Even if this was not the cause of the Delta accident, such an
occurrence could be the cause of another one,'' he wrote, urging the
FAA to issue an emergency directive to correct the B727 stall
warning system.
   Dave Duff, FAA spokesman in Seattle, said the region's Aircraft
Certification Division has started investigating the factors
mentioned in the letter.
   He said the FAA plans no action before NTSB hearings on the Delta
crash begin in Dallas on Tuesday.
   Michael Benson, spokesman for the NTSB in Washington, D.C.,
declined comment on the ALPA letter, but noted that the stall
warning system will be a subject of the NTSB hearings. Benson said
ALPA is a party to the hearings and can question witnesses about the
system.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Jack Gamble likewise
declined comment because the stall warning system will be discussed
at the NTSB hearing.
   In September, the FAA as a precaution ordered operators of 727s
to check the takeoff alarms. The agency announced Oct. 20 that in 35
of approximately 1,200 727s examined, the alarms either did not work
or worked improperly.

   The Reagan administration says last summer's
drought took such a large bite out of the economy that it will add
about $3 billion to the reductions needed in next year's federal
budget deficit.
   Joseph R. Wright, director of the White House's Office of
Management and Budget, said in an interview Tuesday that the
administration now believes the fiscal 1990 deficit will have to be
slashed by about $35 billion to comply with federal law.
   He said that in the 1990 budget the administration currently is
writing, about $15 billion in reductions probably would come from
various benefit programs for the sick, farmers, federal retirees and
others who automatically qualify for government help.
   He said the rest would come from a combination of reductions in
other federal spending, sales of federal assets and increases in
user fees.

of the legislation are arguing over the measure's potential
restrictions on the executive branch.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., took vehement exception Tuesday to
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater's assertions that the
Post-Government Restrictions Act could have the effect of
prohibiting a former president from ``calling an incumbent

   Reacting to this description offered by Fitzwater on Monday,
Frank said the presidential spokesman's complaints about the bill
were rooted in ``flat lies.''
   For his part, Fitzwater backed away Tuesday from his earlier
suggestion that Reagan might withhold his signature from the

   An outbreak of whooping cough has claimed
the life of one infant in western New York's Amish community but has
done little to break down the conservative Christian group's
resistance to inoculation.
   During the past three weeks, the number of confirmed cases of the
disease, which federal records indicate is fatal in eight of 1,000
cases among infants under age 6 months, has risen from six to 33. A
3-month-old infant died Oct. 31.
   The outbreak, the second this decade in the community, has health
officials worried about the rest of the 1,200 to 1,500 Amish who
live in an area about 70 miles south of Buffalo. A vaccine has
nearly eliminated whooping cough in the nation's general population,
but most of the Amish avoid vaccinations and other conventional
medical treatments.
   ``It's a very large concern,'' said Mary Anne Power, Cattaraugus
County supervising public health nurse. ``Any public health official
would be concerned about an epidemic in such a large non-vaccinated
community.''

   Thousands of inmates are going home for Thanksgiving prison
furloughs that are business as usual in a majority of states,
including most that voted for the man who made such programs a
heated issue, President-elect George Bush.
   While some officials concede that such programs can be abused by
inmates, many insist furloughs are an effective way to relieve
prison overcrowding and promote rehabilitation.
   ``The inmates really protect the program,'' said Ed Ligtenberg,
an associate warden in South Dakota, where 18 minimum-security
inmates are going home for Thanksgiving. ``It's good for the inmates
because it gradually reintegrates them to the outside.''
   But, he added: ``It's not a right. ... They have to earn it.''
   Furloughs have ``proven to be productive on a national scale,''
said Tom Powers, the warden of the North Dakota State
Penitentiary,where 15 prisoners are going home for Thanksgiving in
what he calls an ``extremely conservative'' program.

   To passers-by along historic Strand
Avenue, the buildings of Old Galveston Square look like any of the
other 19th-century structures restored a few years ago to boost this
island city's tourism appeal. And yet the windows are dusty, the
suites empty, the project unfinished.
   J.R. McConnell was here.
   Graffiti on a wall of one of the millionaire developer's empty
buildings reflects the conflicting legacy he left when he
electrocuted himself in jail in July at age 41 while awaiting trial
on charges of fraud and embezzlement.
   ``In memory of J.R.,'' the scrawled words say. ``Time was too
short. Galveston loves you.''
   McConnell's penchant for extravagance shows in Old Galveston
Square's iron statues, its marble and brass and the huge, sculptured
trumpet that once greeted guests at the 1984 World's Fair in New
Orleans.
   McConnell seemed to be everywhere on this island during those
glory years of the oil boom, when money was plentiful.
   He had arrived in Houston in 1979 towing a World War II surplus
trailer behind an old Camaro because, he liked to say, ``I couldn't
afford a U-Haul.''
   In half a dozen years he built a multimillion-dollar development
empire that included 120 companies and hundreds of apartments,
shopping centers and office buildings in Houston, Galveston and
elsewhere.
   Then the empire crashed like the price of West Texas crude.
   McConnell's bankruptcy in 1986 left behind scores of investors
who lost their life savings by gambling on his promises and
believing in his benevolence _ a publicized willingness to
underwrite civic projects that may have contributed to his downfall.
   ``He was clearly a very complex character and clearly very
competent at some things, including the ability to sell the same
pieces of property over and over,'' said H.L. ``Shrub'' Kempner Jr.,
a Galveston banker and financial consultant.
   ``But he was unusual compared to a lot of the `scheme' guys in
that he actually tried to build up some quality projects at the same
time he bilked people out of their money.''
   McConnell placed ads in newspapers promising high returns to
investors, a pledge he kept for a while. As his finances eroded, he
could keep the promise no longer but still tried.
   He signed bank notes giving him access to millions of dollars,
officials said, but left loan officers around the country holding
identical liens.
   ``Our investigation could have gone on for years and years and we
might never have been able to unravel all of it,'' said U.S.
Attorney Henry Oncken.
   McConnell's bankruptcy filing was disastrous: Small investors
lost their savings, contractors were forced into bankruptcy and
banks hoping to recoup their losses found others standing in line
with titles to the same property.
   Symbolizing the financial and legal mess was the shell of a
condominium-hotel, part of a 440-acre project that McConnell called
Grand Beach, which stood rotting in the Gulf breeze until a fire
destroyed it last month.
   Authorities quickly labeled the fire an arson, and the list of
suspects, said fire department investigator Rusty Kattner, runs as
long as the list of creditors.
   It was another McConnell who inspired the mournful graffiti _ the
McConnell who completed other projects with a flourish, the
millionaire developer who worked closely with preservationists to
rebuild a historic city and boost tourism.
   While acknowledging ``the majority opinion ... that he did many
things illegally,'' Peter Brink, director of the Galveston
Historical Foundation, said of McConnell, ``I still have a certain
affection for him.
   ``In the end I think he believed he could pull it off and make it
work. I don't think he was out to swindle a lot of people out of
their money.''
   Many disagree.
   ``He was a crook and a scam man _ that's all,'' said Galveston
electrical contractor Frank Norris, who said he was forced into
bankruptcy after McConnell failed to pay him $170,000.
   Don Hubbel, a former city councilman who worked two years as a
top McConnell assistant in Galveston before the bankruptcy filing,
thinks many of the developer's dealings ultimately helped the city
but says McConnell's benevolence always came with a motive.
   ``He never gave a cent of money unless he saw some way that it
was going to help J.R. McConnell,'' said Hubbel.
   McConnell was known for working 16-hour days and involving
himself in every aspect of his real estate projects, right down to
his own inspections of the plumbing and electrical systems.
   Once, facing a deadline for completion of a project, he bet a
work crew $10,000 that it couldn't finish in time, then showed up
with a briefcase full of cash and honored the debt, Hubbel said.
``He really knew how to do things,'' he said.
   ``Of course, we know now that he wasn't using his own money _ but
it was all first class.''

<HEAD>Fred Astaire Dances Again in Restored 1958 Videotape</HEAD>

   The tape was so old it had outlived the
machinery to play it. But through digital wizardry, the magic of
Fred Astaire's dancing will again enchant television audiences, 30
years after his first TV appearance.
   That first special, ``An Evening With Fred Astaire,'' co-starring
dance partner Barrie Chase, was first televised Oct. 17, 1958, on
NBC. It won nine Emmy awards. Astaire died in June 1987 at age 88.
   The Disney Channel is bringing back that show, along with two
other specials, seven Astaire movies and two documentaries in a
cable TV tribute called ``Hats Off to Fred Astaire'' that spans 5{
weeks.
   The Disney Channel will air the special this Sunday, to be
followed by ``Another Evening with Fred Astaire'' from 1959 on Dec.
18 and ``Astaire Time'' from 1960 on Jan. 8, 1989.
   Putting that first show together combined elements of a detective
drama and a science documentary.
   ``This was probably the oldest color videotape still in
existence,'' said Robert Rosen director of the UCLA Film and
Television Archive. ``The tape was good; the problem was the
equipment to run it no longer existed. We had to track down a
technician who had worked on the original equipment.
   ``He had a copy of the specifications, and we used that to build
a machine to play the tape. We were then able to transfer the show
onto state-of-the-art digital equipment. The picture looks better
today than it did 30 years ago.''
   Rosen and his technical adviser, Ed Reitan, showed the results of
18 months of work at a luncheon attended by Astaire's widow, Robin;
Chase; musical director David Rose; choreographer Hermes Pan, and
producer Bud Yorkin.
   The first images on the TV screens were dark and murky. Next, he
showed how the tape had been restored for a revival on public
television. The picture looked like an overexposed photograph.
Finally, he showed the special as it will be broadcast on cable. The
picture was crisp and clear, and the colors were bright and sharply
defined. It could have been taped yesterday.
   ``There's nothing like it,'' said Chase, ``but it's also very
sad. It's a little too soon to look at it after Fred's passing. I'm
pleased with what UCLA did. I laugh at the thought of my son seeing
his mom as she used to be. I have a sad and nostalgic feeling of the
emotion I felt when I was doing this.''
   Asked about Astaire's dancing, she replied, ``I don't think what
Fred had is definable. It's something that touches all generations.
You could use a lot of platitudes, which Fred would hate. Fred was a
man who set out to do his job as well as he could and he had that
special magic. He had the grace of an animal. He never made an
awkward move.''
   For the special, musical director Rose assembled an orchestra
with 18 strings to create a more graceful sound compatible with
Astaire's dancing.
   ``Usually for a variety show you'd have 10 strings,'' he said.
``I didn't want the brass to predominate. It takes 50 violins to
equal the volume of one trumpet in a concert hall.''
   Rose said Astaire was ``a perfectionist, but there was no ego. He
didn't try to run the show. A lot of big stars are perfectionists,
but they do it in a mean way.''
   Rosen said the Astaire show was chosen for restoration because
``our strategy was to restore a program the audiences would fall in
love with. That way they would appreciate the need to preserve these
old programs.''
   He said the UCLA Archive is second only to the Library of
Congress in the number of old motion picture films and television
shows it has.
   Ginger Rogers, Astaire's dance partner in four of the films to be
shown, will introduce the motion pictures. The films and dates are:
``The Gay Divorcee, Dec. 5; ``Swing Time,'' Dec. 12; ``Follow the
Fleet,'' Dec. 19; ``Shall We Dance,'' Dec. 26, all with Rogers;
``Three Little Words,'' with Vera-Ellen, Nov. 21; ``Royal Wedding,''
with Jane Powell, Nov. 28, and ``Funny Face,'' with Audrey Hepburn,
Jan. 2.
   The documentaries are ``Fred Astaire: Puttin' on the Top Hat'' on
Dec. 11 and ``Fred Astaire: Change Partners and Dance'' on Jan. 1.

   ``Pyramid,'' a PBS special on Monday night, is
about some world-famous monuments dedicated to the notion that you
CAN take it with you.
   Based on David Macaulay's 1975 book, ``Pyramid'' combines
location shots of some of Egypt's greatest wonders with an animated
cartoon story weaving historical gossip about royal family intrigues
and speculation on how the tombs were built, some of them more than
4,000 years ago.
   The show clearly explains the details of construction, although
plot twists in the animation, a kind of ``docudrama'' historical
cartoon strip, tend to get a little too convoluted.
   From 3,000 to 1,100 B.C., Egypt was ruled by kings called
pharaohs. The Egyptians believed that when pharaohs died they became
gods, so their tombs were the largest and most elaborate of all.
   The ancient Egyptians also considered death the beginning of a
new life in another world. This life would last forever, they
believed, if certain precautions were taken, including preserving
corpses by mummification.
   A pyramid's burial chamber held the mummy and all the objects,
actual and symbolic, that would help the person's spirit, known as
the ka, survive in the afterlife.
   ``One of the reasons we have such a rich legacy of artifacts and
information, much of it about everyday life, is that much of it was
entombed for use in the next world,'' said Macaulay, who has
published 14 other books, including his latest, ``The Way Things
Work.''
   The show includes a visit to a museum with an exhibit of a
replica taken from a pyramid of an Egyptian cattle dealer. He
``wanted to take his business with him,'' said Macaulay, who serves
as the show's host and guide, ``and so he did _ in a model. He even
had some accountants in the model to make sure he wasn't
shortchanged.
   ``The models were as important as real life. They were the real
thing; they weren't just models in the minds of the Egyptians,''
Macaulay said in an interview.
   Macaulay spent several weeks on location in February 1986. ``We
were given access to all sorts of things that people are not
normally given access to,'' he said. ``We had, for instance, the
Cairo museum to ourselves for three nights running.''
   The film goes beyond the book by showing the urban sprawl that is
encroaching on the historical sites. There are, for example, some
glimpses of pyramids near modern residential neighborhoods of Giza,
a suburb of Cairo.
   ``You can get shots of them from the desert side, and it looks
like there's nothing around them. But if you shoot them from the
building side, you end up with little buildings that are five or six
stories high in front of these pyramids and for the first time you
really get a sense of the scale of these pyramids.''
   The great pyramid at Giza is 481 feet high or about the size of a
40-story office building. It was built with more than 2 million
blocks of stone, some weighing 15 tons, and covers the equivalent of
seven square blocks of midtown Manhattan. It stretches 755 feet on
each of its four sides and is so close to geometric perfection that
the difference between the longest and shortest side is only 7
inches.
   In the book, the pyramid and complex of surrounding temples and
tombs are imaginary. They are, however, based closely on several of
the pyramids and temples still standing in Egypt.
   The show's script was written by Marc Olshaker, who also was
producer, in cooperation with Macaulay and a group of five
Egyptologists from the United States and Egypt.
   ``Pyramid'' is the third PBS production by Unicorn Projects,
which also did specials on two previous Macaulay books,
``Cathedral'' in 1986 and ``Castle'' in 1983.

   Randall A.Terry, founder of the
``Operation Rescue'' movement to block entrances to abortion clincs,
predicts more than 500,000 arrests in the movement in the next 12
months.
   In a story in the Christian Herald, a non-denominational monthly

tension and strain about the issue to the point that abortion is
again outlawed.
   About 9,000 people have been arrested in the movement in the last
six months, about l,000 of them in Atlanta.
   Robert K. Skolrood, executive director of the National Legal
Foundation in Virginia Beach, Va., told the magazine that straining

   Before launching the space shuttle Discovery in
September, NASA issued a 72-page press kit to describe the mission
and its astronauts in meticulous detail. For the next launch, Dec.
1, there is no press kit at all.
   The difference is that Flight 27 is a military mission flown by
military men to launch a secret military payload. All that NASA and
the Air Force will say is that the launch will be between 6:32 and
9:32 a.m. EST and that there will be five crew members.
   Because the Air Force is in charge of STS-27, there is none of
the hoopla that accompanies other shuttle flights. No daily morning
briefings on the readiness of the ship, no launch-day-minus-one
series of briefings on crew, mission and payload. No industry
representatives handing out fact sheets and literature.
   The Air Force undoubtedly would prefer that no one even see the
launch, but it is difficult to hide the liftoff of something 184
feet tall, trailing fire for 700 feet. So, instead, the Air Force
tries to give as few advance details as possible.
   The flight of Atlantis will be only the third time that a shuttle
mission is strictly for military pursuits.
   Although the cargo is secret, word leaks out. Atlantis, according
to reports, is carrying an intelligence-gathering satellite that,
once in its orbit, will fly over 80 percent of the Soviet Union. The
two earlier military missions, both in 1985, put satellites into
orbit, one to eavesdrop and two for communications.
   The Space Act of 1958, which created NASA, specified that the
agency was to develop peaceful uses of space in an open program. But
the military always has had and will continue to have a strong role
in both NASA and space.
   In fact, before the 1986 Challenger accident halted shuttle
flights for 32 months, NASA was so worried it would lose Air Force
business that it got the White House to help work out an agreement
that the military would use one-third of shuttle cargo space.
   NASA also fought Air Force efforts to re-establish expendable
rockets as means to get satellites into orbits, hoping to keep the
shuttle the sole launch vehicle. In light of the Challenger accident
later, it was fortunate that the space agency lost that fight and
some Titan rockets already were on the production line.
   In its early day, the space agency had no rockets, so it
purchased ballistic missiles from the military and fitted them with
upper stages. The Army's Redstone and the Air Force's Atlas boosted
the first Americans into space.
   The early NASA astronauts were military test pilots, and until
the shuttle came along, the Navy was called in to retrieve
astronauts and their ships from the water. NASA returned the favor
by making its breakthroughs in materials, electronics and computer
technology available to the military.
   As the shuttle was being developed, the Air Force realized it
could become a valuable military tool and it imposed some design
changes, among them the size of the cargo bay and an increase in its
ability to land cross-range.
   Along the way, however, some disenchantment developed.
   NASA's openness was anathema to a service that likes secrets. So
when the Air Force built a shuttle launch pad at Vandenberg AFB in
California, it tucked it in among hills. The Air Force also tried,
with some success, to limit access to the press site at Cape
Canaveral, citing safety concerns.
   At the time of the Challenger accident, the reserve of expendable
launch vehicles had dwindled to a dozen and in congressional
testimony NASA was arguing strongly for retaining the shuttle as the
sole launch vehicle.
   The Air Force, especially then-Deputy Air Force Secretary Edward
C. Aldridge, had been fighting for two years to maintain an
alternate launch route.
   The Challenger tragedy, with its loss of seven lives, turned NASA
around and its plans now are enthusiastically in favor of a mixed
fleet in which shuttles will launch what only shuttles can launch
and leave the rest to expendable launch vehicles. The irony is, NASA
must buy its single-use rockets from the Air Force.

<TEXT>
   For most of this century, one West Side landmark
tended to the sick and suffering and provided for the poor. But the
proud hospital finally faced one ailing patient it couldn't heal:
itself.
   This was not the fictional St. Eligius closing down in the final
season of television's ``St. Elsewhere,'' but St. Anne's Hospital, a
real-life anchor in a struggling neighborhood, shutting its doors
after 85 years.
   Too little income and too much debt proved to be the formula for
failure _ one being repeated increasingly in hospitals nationwide.
   ``Most of the people feel they've been deserted, walked out on,''
said Mary Volpe, a local resident.
   ``It dampens the spirit of the community,'' said Alderman Danny
Davis. ``It diminishes the quality of life in our community. It
diminishes the level of hope.''
   Across America, big cities and small towns alike are losing
precious hospitals. Health care is changing: demand for beds is
down, costs are up. With fewer paying patients and more reliance on
government programs that critics say are too stingy, the nation's
hospital system has reached a breaking point.
   ``We're in a health-care crisis,'' said Earl Bird, president of
the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council, an association of local
hospitals. ``We're not heading for anything, we're in the throes of
it.''
   Twice in two years, record numbers of hospitals have closed: 79
in 1987 _ 17 of them in Texas alone _ and 71 in 1986, the American
Hospital Association says. In the first 10 months of this year,
preliminary reports show 75 more hospitals shut their doors.
   The causes cross demographic boundaries: The closings are evenly
divided between rural and urban hospitals.
   While about 30 percent of all hospitals are losing money, twice
that percentage can show their unstaunched flow of red ink comes
specifically from rising costs of patient treatment, said Carol
McCarthy, hospital association president.
   ``That,'' she said, ``is a fragile hospital system.''
   Many cities have experienced the decline. According to health
officials:
   _ New York City saw 34 of its 104 hospitals close in 1976-86.
Unlike cities with too many vacant beds, New York has 90 percent
occupancy rates, said Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York
Hospital Association. AIDS and drug problems, he said, have
prolonged hospital stays.
   _ From 1983 to the present, 22 of Los Angeles County's 182
community hospitals have closed or converted to other kinds of care.
   _ Chicago has seen 10 hospitals fold since 1984. Seven are in
areas designated as medically underserved, meaning they have high
infant mortality rates, large elderly populations and too few
doctors. Last year, two-thirds of all Chicago hospitals lost money.
   Cities, McCarthy said, are seeing a ``domino effect'' _ a
hospital serving the poor closes, so people move to another one
nearby, which develops the same problems and often suffers the same
fate.
   ``Eventually, you're going to wind up with a medical wasteland,''
said Kenneth Robbins, president of the Illinois Hospital Association.
   The reasons for this collapse aren't all negative: Americans are
living longer, and improved medicine makes most hospital stays
shorter or even unnecessary. A patient once hospitalized 12 days for
major abdominal surgery, for example, could now be out in three.
   But there's plenty of finger-pointing over dollars and cents.
   Hospital officials claim the government has shirked
responsibility by underfunding Medicaid, which serves the poor, and
Medicare, which serves the elderly.
   They say Medicare problems intensified in 1983 after a new system
began paying hospitals flat fees according to diagnosis. Some
hospitals are also worried by a rule that took effect Nov. 1,
reducing the amount Medicare pays for patients who are hospitalized
for long periods.
   In Illinois, Medicare pays only 89 cents for each dollar of care,
while Medicaid pays just 67 cents, Robbins said. State officials
insist their Medicaid share is higher, but won't say how much.
   ``For every Medicaid patient a hospital sees, it simply loses
more money than if it didn't see the patient at all,'' Robbins said.
   Medicaid also can hinder doctor recruitment, Robbins said,
because reimbursement is so low. A doctor in a poor neighborhood
would have to see three times as many patients as one in a
comfortable suburb to earn the same salary.
   ``This actually encourages Medicaid mills'' _ doctors writing
bogus bills or packing in large numbers of patients for financial
gain, he said.
   Adding to this squeeze is charity. Some 37 million Americans have
no insurance; in Chicago, it's 20 percent of the population.
Illinois hospitals gave $600 million in free care last year.
   But state officials say the fault lies not with the government
but with the hospitals, which operate inefficiently and haven't kept
pace with a changing society.
   ``Hospitals like St. Anne's are the steel mills of the hospital
industry,'' said Edward Duffy, former director of the state
Department of Public Aid. ``People don't use hospitals like they
used to.''
   Some say both arguments are valid.
   ``It's one of those tragic situations where everybody is right
and everybody is wrong,'' said Dr. Quentin Young, professor of
preventive medicine at the University of Illinois.
   ``We have created a two-tiered system,'' he said, ``people with
resources who get the benefits and weaknesses of the system, and 20
percent and growing who are locked out. That is the tragic dilemma
of American health care.''
   It's hit hard in Austin, Chicago's largest neighborhood with
140,000 residents. The closing of the block-long, 437-bed hospital
two months ago was one more setback in this predominantly black
section that has grappled with crime, white flight, panic peddlers
and slum landlords. Now it's lost a major employer _ the hospital
staff once numbered 650.
   Some people also worry the loss will hurt those who need medical
help the most but postpone seeking it until the last minute.
   ``Poor people do not take time out for preventive health
services,'' said Jacquelin Reed, chairwoman of the West Side Health
Coalition. ``If you don't have any medical insurance, you wait until
you have to go to the emergency room.''
   The remaining neighborhood hospital, 2{ miles away, provides no
obstetric care, and Austin has higher than average rates of sexually
transmitted diseases and an infant mortality rate twice the national
average.
   What doomed St. Anne's is what has destroyed others.
   When it closed, about 70 percent of its patients were Medicaid
recipients; 20 percent more were Medicare.
   Losses were running about $500,000 a month. Had St. Anne's
remained open, they probably would have reached $12 million this
year, said Kate Stuckmann, chief operating officer.
   Cutbacks in staff and beds _ the hospital had 120 open when it
closed _ weren't enough. And as doctors left the city, they referred
patients to suburban hospitals.
   It was a sad end to a hospital that served valiantly in times of
tragedy, including a 1958 fire that killed 92 children and three
nuns at Our Lady of Angels school.
   Even now, two months after the closing, ``this community is in a
state of shock,'' said Cynthia Williams, director of the Austin
Peoples Action Center. ``We basically don't know what to do if an
accident occurs. Austin is in crisis.''

<DATELINE>WHITE HALL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this tranquil farm town, folks are
accustomed to life without a movie house. Now, they'll have to cope
without a more precious commodity _ a hospital.
   White Hall Hospital, a Main Street fixture for nearly eight
decades, is out of business. A ``gone fishing'' sign is tacked above
the entrance.
   ``Everybody's scared to death,'' said businessman Jim Ballard.
``What if a kid is run over? Or someone has a heart attack? You're
pretty much left alone. It's a great loss.''
   ``It's like you're losing your identity,'' said Dr. Ludwig Dech,
a silver-haired physician who was on White Hall's staff 30 years.
``Who in the medical community is going to locate where you don't
have a hospital?''
   White Hall has joined the growing list of farm towns that have
struggled throughout this decade, losing people, businesses and,
finally, a life-and-death resource: the hospital.
   ``The question is not whether hospitals will close, but which
ones are going to close, who's going to make the decision ... and
what's going to be left,'' said Robert Van Hook, executive director
of the National Rural Health Association.
   The number of rural hospital closings has jumped from seven in
1983 to 40 in 1987, Van Hook said. Forty percent of last year's
closings, he said, were in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana.
   From 1981 to 1986, admissions to rural community hospitals fell
24 percent _ from 8.4 million to 6.4 million, the American Hospital
Association says.
   In 1986, the group reports, occupancy averaged 55 percent; it was
less than 40 percent among hospitals in Texas and those with fewer
than 50 beds.
   ``The whole system is going into shock,'' said Glenn Klein, a
consultant hired this year as White Hall's administrator. ``There's
not enough money in the system to cover the people.''
   He should know. White Hall Hospital averaged 40 percent occupancy
and lost almost $500,000 last year. It provided $911,000 in care for
which it wasn't reimbursed.
   What's ailing America's rural hospitals is similar to what's
crippling urban ones: declining demand and money. But in small
towns, the major obstacle seems to be Medicare, which serves the
elderly, a large chunk of rural hospital patients.
   Under federal rules, rural hospitals receive less per Medicare
patient than urban ones. The rural-urban difference is, on average,
36-37 percent, Van Hook said.
   Medicare pays by diagnosis, so a city hospital treating a stroke
victim would receive $4,055, while a rural hospital would receive
$2,990, said Tim Size, executive director of the Rural Wisconsin
Hospital Cooperative.
   The dual scale, established in 1983, assumes treatment costs are
lower in small-town hospitals. Although rural hospitals are somewhat
cheaper, Van Hook acknowledged, the difference shrivels as cases
become more complex and the patient load drops.
   ``Being underpaid each of the last six years, it's taken its
toll,'' Van Hook said. ``You can't buy new equipment. You can't
raises nurses' salaries. You can't make the improvements.''
   The White Hall area, like many that have witnessed the steady
exodus of their young people, has a larg elderly population. Almost
one in five Greene County residents is 65 or older; nearly 10
percent of all county residents receive public aid.
   Those factors helped sink the 30-bed hospital. Last year, 85
percent of hospital patients were Medicare or Medicaid recipients or
indigent, Klein said.
   ``When your reimbursement is primarily Medicare and Medicaid, you
have a rope around your neck,'' Klein said, explaining that White
Hall last year received 49 cents for every dollar of services
provided.
   The rural health association filed suit in Washington earlier
this month, claiming the dual-scale differential was too large and
rural hospitals were being forced to subsidize Medicare.
   A similar suit was filed in February by 28 rural Missouri
hospitals, which alleged the federal system was arbitrary,
capricious and discriminatory, said Jerry Sill, legal counsel for
the Missouri Hospital Association.
   Already, the loss of rural hospitals has people worried about
treatment delays.
   ``When you have to have to go 50-60-70 miles, things get very
difficult if you're about to deliver a baby. ... If you're bleeding
or if something's wrong ... you don't need an hour or two-hour
ride,'' Van Hook said.
   And when a small town loses its hospital, it also loses doctors
and nurses and struggles to replace them, hampered by having less
money to offer and fewer amenities. ``We don't have opera every
Saturday night,'' Van Hook said. ``We often don't have theater. Many
times we don't even have McDonalds.''
   To combat their financial problems, rural hospitals are
diversifying. Some in Iowa are offering adult day care or turning
cafeterias into catering services.
   For the 3,000 residents of White Hall, there wasn't time to
diversify.
   ``We did not realize the need to change until it was too late,''
Klein said, noting that local hospitals have been losing patients
for years to regional hospitals with more services and specialists.
   Still, the hospital didn't give up easily.
   In the late 1970s, it remodeled to meet government standards. A
few years ago, it recruited three doctors, Klein said, reopened an
obstetrics unit at their request and purchased a building three
miles away in Roodhouse for a clinic.
   ``We guaranteed them a good living,'' Klein said. ``We helped
them in recruiting their patients. ... People thought this would be
something they could use to build and expand on.''
   But the doctors notified the hospital board in December they had
decided to stop delivering babies. ``It was almost a stab in the
back,'' Klein said.
   Two of the doctors still have hours at the Roodhouse clinic. The
remaining doctor working full-time in White Hall said it would be
too stressful to handle deliveries alone and be on call 24 hours a
day.
   Even then, the hospital kept trying. It cut staff. It reduced
inventory. It failed.
   ``This not only affects us emotionally and sentimentally,'' said
Bob Moulton, hospital board president. ``It also affects us
economically. We lost a payroll of $864,000.''
   That will hurt Main Street. But the impact could go well beyond.
   The town no longer has a medical center to stabilize emergency
patients. The nearest hospital is 10 miles away, but the ambulances
making the trip are staffed by county medical technicians, untrained
in such critical tasks as inserting intravenous tubes.
   ``Ten miles without primary care services are darn dangerous
miles,'' Klein said. The nearest trauma center is 27 miles distant,
and Klein said a 40-minute ride is potentially fatal for an accident
or heart attack victim.
   When White Hall closed in early September and filed Chapter 7
bankruptcy, Klein said, many couldn't believe it.
   ``The community, for many years, had a wait-and-see attitude. The
community could have saved the hospital and kept it open,'' he said,
but ``there was no point in doing that. We didn't have the
patients.''

   Here are some facts about hospitals and health care provided by
the American Hospital Association, the National Rural Health
Association, the National Hospital Panel Survey, the Texas Hospital
Association and a survey conducted by the Touche Ross accounting and
management consulting firm:
   
   Closings:
   In 1987, 79 community hospitals closed in 30 states: 35 for
profit, 30 non-profit and 14 owned and operated by the government.
   Of those closed, 17 were in Texas, eight others in Arkansas,
Oklahoma and Louisiana.
   Most hospitals that closed had 25-99 beds.
   Seventeen non-community hospitals in 13 states also shut down
last year. They generally provide specialty care, such as
rehabilitative or psychiatric treatment.

<TEXT>
   Finances:
   Half of all urban hospitals operated in the red in 1987; nearly
seven of 10 rural hospitals lost money.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Location:
   In 1986, more than 46 percent of the nation's community hospitals
were in rural areas. Of the 2,638 rural hospitals, 71 percent had
fewer than 100 beds.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Medicare:
   The price of goods and services purchased by hospitals from 1984
to 1988 rose 22 percent, while the amount Medicare pays to hospitals
increased just 11 percent.
   A 1988 survey of 1,400 hospital executives found that 48 percent
think reduced Medicare reimbursements may force their hospitals to
shut in the next five years.

   Hospitalization:
   About 33.6 million people were hospitalized in 1987, an 11
percent drop since 1982.

<HEAD>Clinical Ethicist On Hospital Staff Is Rarity</HEAD>

   At St. John's Regional Health Center,
Tobias Meeker helps doctors and patients cope with moral issues such
as when to deny life support to a terminally ill patient, or what
measure of care to give an infant with an uncertain future.
   ``I'm very careful to let people know I'm not practicing
medicine,'' says Meeker, the hospital's theologically trained
clinical ethicist. ``Also, I am not making the decisions. The
physician and the patient, they are the decision makers _ that's the
only ethical way.''
   Meeker, 43, is one of the few ethicists in the country employed
full time at a hospital, a rarity in a group that is itself small.
Officials at the American Hospital Association estimate only 100-150
clinical ethicists are working in any capacity in the United States.
   Meeker's work brings him up against such poignant dilemmas as
that posed by an 83-year-old woman who, after her second bout with a
serious illness, told doctors, ``I would just as soon that you allow
me to die, because my chances of recovery are so slim.''
   ``Can we, ethically, allow her to die? Yes.'' Meeker said.
   He also works often in the hospital's neonatal care unit,
advising doctors to go to great lengths to save the lives of
desperately ill newborns, even though adults in similar conditions
might be considered hopeless.
   ``When in doubt, go all out,'' he said. ``For newborn infants,
it's a vast area of doubt. Our data base is very inadequate, so not
to proceed aggressively is irresponsible.''
   Meeker said in one case, the family of an 80-year-old woman
suffering from acute dementia was horrified at the process by which
she was artificially fed. The woman was restrained at all times to
keep her from pulling the feeding tube from her nose.
   So, Meeker agreed with the family's decision to remove the tube,
hastening the woman's death but giving dignity to her final days.
   He noted a decline in what he calls issues of physician truth
telling.
   ``Not too long ago, physicians would routinely not tell their
patients they're dying, or they have cancer,'' he said. ``Many
physicians acting out of that model are protecting themselves, not
the patient. The second reason that we've gotten away from that has
been the discovery ... that people can deal much more easily with
the truth than with illusion.''
   Concerning a patient who tested positive for AIDS but refused to
tell his wife, Meeker said the patient was persuaded that he had a
moral obligation to tell her. However, if he hadn't, the physician
would have been ethically bound to do so, Meeker said, adding:
   ``Confidentiality is not an absolute right. It's a very strong
right, but for very compelling reasons, it can be overruled. And a
very compelling reason would be that someone else's life was in
jeopardy.''
   Meeker said he acts as a facilitator, prodding physicians and
patients to consider all necessary and available information before
making a decision.
   He also provides a few guideposts: that any decision must first
and foremost benefit the patient; that it is wrong to take the life
of the innocent; that suicide is wrong; and that ``life is a great
good ... but it's not the greatest good.''
   Rev. Kevin O'Rourke, director of the Center for Health Care
Ethics based at St. Louis University Medical Center, said most
hospitals refer such questions to ethics committees composed of
doctors, nurses and clergymen and other professionals.
   Only ``a few, very few'' hospitals have positions such as
Meeker's, O'Rourke said.
   ``To have an ethics person on staff means that you have a
continuing educational program. The progressive hospitals are moving
toward that,'' O'Rourke said.
   At St. John's, an 800-bed hospital operated by the Sisters of
Mercy, Meeker said: ``My job is integral to the Sisters of Mercy
mission, to their commitment to really serve the sick and the poor.''
   Meeker, a Catholic and a Harvard honors graduate with a master's
of divinity from Yale and a master's in bioethics from Georgetown
University, had been a counsellor at the hospital since 1983.
   He said the hospital last year retained him in his present post
as someone who had both clinical knowledge and ``a grounding in
ethics and theology.''
   He said he approaches his duties with an Eastern sensibility that
he developed as an undergraduate _ he wrote his honors thesis on
Gandhi _ and later as a teacher in India.
   ``Ethics is a very self-conscious process, you don't accept
something just because it's always been that way,'' he said. ``I am
profoundly a Buddhist-Christian. I think that the structure of
reality is process, the structure of reality is change and growth.
The Buddhist tradition is founded on that.''

<HEAD>Taxes and Such Are Nothing New</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Year after year, enterprising Americans and other
bright folks around the world rediscover old truths and put them
back to work.
   In business, for example, American companies are learning the
rudimentary truth that survival in a service society demands
service, or to put it another way, that the customer won't come back
unless the business provides.
   The lesson has been known, of course, from the beginning of
economic society, and the proof was everywhere _ in the sound
companies that didn't forget and prospered, and the poor companies
that forgot and went bankrupt.
   Now, in a service society, many companies that allegedly provide
service are learning the hard way that the public expects them to
follow through, not just in their advertising brochures but in
customer satisfaction.
   Manufacturers have been learning a lesson too. Remember quality?
A massive segment of U.S. manufacturing tended to forget that a
deterioration of product quality eventually would show up in the
bottom line.
   Twenty years ago, for example, some of America's biggest
manufacturers, including carmakers, decided that quality was too
costly on high-speed production lines. They sent out imperfect
products, and depended on a secondary industry to repair those
defects. The concept failed.
   Instead of accepting imperfect cars that were sold with repair
guarantees, Americans opted for foreign cars that were made properly
the first time. Detroit recovered, but not before it had permanently
lost much of its market.
   The string of lessons learned, forgotten and relearned goes on
and on.
   In today's credit society, some people may have forgotten that
credit has to be repaid. In social welfare areas, there's a
reawakening of the realization that a person's responsibility for
himself can be assigned to nobody else.
   It took a crisis in Social Security to make people aware that
they must pump more money into the fund if they expected to take it
out later. And some seers claim that 30 years from now it will take
another crisis to remind them.
   In health insurance benefits it is becoming increasingly clear
that the more money provided to workers in corporate and union plans
the higher becomes the cost of medical care, offsetting that route
to painless good health.
   And in politics, people are face to face with their own creation,
a mammoth government they allowed to evolve, allegedly to serve but
which instead is sopping up tax money at a rate beyond their means.
   This latter conflict, which can be matched throughout history, is
once again the big issue in Washington, with a president-elect
promising no new taxes while an intellectual elite insists that
taxes must be raised.
   The latest tax drama has a somewhat different script, new actors
and a fresh presentation _ but it is the same old story: government
cannot provide services expected of it for the revenues offered
without cutting somewhere.
   Right now, an outpouring of papers and statements urging a tax
increase is emerging from all corners of the country, and their
authors are running into a president-elect who has promised to avoid
doing that very thing.
   President Reagan wanted to do that same thing, but he didn't
succeed. Taxes were raised throughout his term. Bit by bit, the tax
reform passed early in his term was completely undone by the end of
his second term.
   If George Bush succeeds...? Well, that indeed might be something
new.

   Today is Thursday, Nov. 24, the 329th day of 1988. There are 37
days left in the year. This is Thanksgiving Day.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Nov. 24, 1963, in a scene captured on live network television,
Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot and mortally wounded Lee
Harvey Oswald as the accused assassin of President John F. Kennedy
was being escorted by police to an armored truck at the Dallas
municipal building for transfer to the county jail.
   On this date:
   In 1784, Zachary Taylor, the 12th President of the United States,
was born in Orange County, Virginia.
   In 1859, British naturalist Charles Darwin published ``On the
Origin of Species,'' a paper in which he explained his theory of
evolution through the process of natural selection.
   In 1863, the Civil War battle for Lookout Mountain began in
Tennessee. Union forces succeeded in taking the mountain two days
later.
   In 1864, French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was born in Albi.
   In 1871, the National Rifle Association was incorporated, and its
first president named: Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside.
   In 1874, barbed wire was patented by Joseph F. Glidden of
Illinois.
   In 1944, U.S. bombers based on Saipan attacked Tokyo in what was
the first raid against the Japanese capital by land-based planes.
   In 1947, a group of motion picture writers, producers and
directors that came to be known as the ``Hollywood Ten'' were cited
for contempt of Congress because of their refusal to reveal whether
they were communists.
   In 1947, John Steinbeck's novel ``The Pearl'' was first published.
   In 1969, Apollo 12 splashed down safely in the Pacific, ending
the second manned mission to the moon.
   In 1971, a hijacker going by the name ``Dan Cooper'' parachuted
from a Northwest Airlines 727 over Washington state with $200,000 in
ransom. The hijacker _ popularly, albeit erroneously, known as
``D.B. Cooper'' _ has not been heard from since.
   In 1985, 58 people died when Egyptian forces stormed a hijacked
Egyptair jetliner parked on the ground at Valletta, Malta.
   Ten years ago: The official death toll in the Jonestown, Guyana,
mass murder-suicide jumped from 408 to at least 775 as Guyanese
authorities acknowledged undercounting, because bodies had been
stacked on top of other bodies. The eventual, final toll: 913,
including Peoples Temple founder Jim Jones.
   Five years ago: The Palestine Liberation Organization released
six Israeli prisoners in exchange for the release of 4,500
Palestinians and Lebanese held by the Israelis.
   One year ago: The United States and the Soviet Union agreed to
scrap shorter- and medium-range missiles in the first superpower
treaty to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons. (The
agreement was signed in Washington the following month by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.)
   Today's birthdays: Producer-writer Garson Kanin is 76. Actor
Howard Duff is 71. Columnist William F. Buckley is 63.
   Thought for today: ``There is always inequity in life. Some men
are killed in a war and some men are wounded, and some men never
leave the country ... Life is unfair.'' _ President John F. Kennedy
(1917-1963).

<HEAD>Cats Try Their Paws At Romeo and Juliet In New Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GHENT, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Romeo and Juliet'' has been reworked for
a new feature film in which Shakespeare's stirring prose, not to
mention the basic ins and outs of acting, is wasted on 108 of its
actors.
   However, Armando Acosta isn't complaining. The expatriate
American is directing over 108 cats and a lone human, British actor
John Hurt, in an updated version of the classic love story of a
couple torn by feuding families.
   ``Romeo and Juliet,'' Acosta's first feature film, takes the
unusual cast from Cologne to Ghent to Venice and ultimately to New
York. All dialogue between the cats will be voiced-over by such
actors as Rex Harrison, Vanessa Redgrave and David Bowie.
   ``The cats won't mouth-move,'' said Acosta.
   ``There is a close line to the original,'' he said in an
interview on the set as he petted Maria, a white Angora, who plays
Juliet.
   Shakespeare, of course, did not write his play for felines, nor
for a New York setting nor a transvestite tramp, played by Hurt. But
then Shakespeare was not the only one to lose something on the way
to Acosta's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
   His Romeo, the ultimate romantic, is played by Daddy, a gray
Persian who was neutered before his first scene. It was a fate that
befell all other tomcats in a bid to prevent chaos on the set.
   Acosta's film, scheduled for release in 1989, depicts the
travails of a ``Venetian kind of class quality cat and the New York
street quality cat,'' said Acosta.
   To get the Venetian clan to the new world, Acosta relies on Hurt,
who plays a Venetian ``bag lady'' devoted to her cats, who are
threatened with extinction in Venice. They are saved by Hurt who
freights them off to New York, where they end up feuding with the
local felines.
   ``It is a very unique idea,'' said Hurt, decked out in rags and a
wig, during a break in shooting on the gothic canals of Ghent.
   Acosta's adopted hometown was chosen for some Venice canal scenes
for logistical reasons.
   Changing his sex for a role is not all that unusual a challenge
for Hurt. In the ``The Elephant Man'' he won critical acclaim for
his portrayal of John Merrick, a 19th century Englishman who was
stricken with a disfiguring disease which left him barely
recognizable.
   Chosing a male for a woman's role is ``to keep this strange and
bizarre quality about the movie,'' said Acosta.
   He hopes the scenes of cats on dark canals, massive car junk
yards, Coney Island hot dog stands and spooky, deserted service
tunnels will similarly add to the film's ``bizarre'' atmosphere.
   ``We do very little rehearsing. Spontaneity is the beauty,'' he
said, in contrast to the ``phony animal movies where you can see
they are performing in a forced way.''
   But relying on chance requires filming hundreds of hours of
footage which takes a healthy bite out of the film's $3 million to
$5 million budget.
   ``It will be a monumental editing task,'' he said.
   A key scenic shot, he said, will be 108 cats crossing Ghent's St
Micheal's Bridge at dawn against a backdrop of gothic scenery. How
it will look on the screen will depend on the mood of the cats,
whether they cross in a bunch, a trickle or whatever, said Acosta.
   Caring for his stars is no mean task, he said. ``They need vast
quantities of food, vast quantities of work, vast quantities of
love.''
   The extras have been lodged in a vacant discotheque in this west
Belgian city. During shooting at Cologne, they stayed at a circus
warehouse. All cats went through a fortnight of quarantine before
being allowed on the set.
   While on the road, the cats travel with the production team and
stay in the same hotels. Acosta shares his room with Maria, who is
fussy about her diet. She likes chicken, ``but only the breast,'' he
said.
   During shooting, huge nets are cast around the scenes to avoid
any of the actors and actresses from wandering off to check out the
locals.
   Making ``Romeo and Juliet'' has been a passion for Acosta for
over two decades. After working with such directors as John Huston
and Blake Edwards, ``Romeo and Juliet'' is his first feature film.
   Once the film has been cut to two hours, Soviet composer Sergei
Prokofiev's version of ``Romeo and Juliet'' will be added. The
script has been adapted by British Shakespearean actor Victor
Spinetti.
   The difficulty with the script, Spinetti said, was blending such
things as cats and cars with Shakespeare's classic verse.
   ``Some cats talk about cars so you have to try to get this into
the script without the audience jolting out of their seats. Of
course, you cannot rewrite something like the balcony scene,'' he
said.
   In the end, said Acosta, the play remains ``a simple
old-fashioned love story. And, yes, she does die at the end, if you
want to know.''

<HEAD>Transplanted Rhinos Flourishing in New Nepalese Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BINAYA GURUACHARYA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAMKULI PHANTA, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tiny footprints recently led
wildlife officials to a baby rhinoceros, the first calf born to a
herd transplanted to this swampy area from another part of Nepal to
preserve them.
   ``We had initially not expected a baby so soon here when we put
the rhinos for the first time in this jungle,'' said Krisha Man
Shrestha, the jubilant warden of Royal Bardia Wildlife Reserve.
   ``We came to know about the new arrival when we first saw the
footprints of the baby rhino. We followed the tracks and found the
mother and the baby in good health.''
   Thirteen rhinoceroses have been transported to the Bardia reserve
since 1986 from the Chitwan sanctuary, 220 dusty miles to the east,
because naturalists feared it was too risky to leave the endangered
animals in just one area where a single epidemic could wipe them
out. The move was made with the assistance of the World Wildlife
Fund.
   The reserve, 406 miles southwest of Katmandu, Nepal's capital, is
similar to Chitwan with its tropical lowland and thick highland
forest.
   ``In the first year we took only four because we felt
translocating animals of this size was a logistics nightmare,'' said
Hemant Raj Mishra, a noted Nepalese naturalist. ``It (the
translocation) has never been done before in Asia.''
   The rhinos previously had been found only in the Chitwan valley,
75 miles southwest of Katmandu in Nepal's southern plains, and in
Kaziranga in the east Indian state of Assam. Kiziranga now has the
most _ 1,000 to 1,200 _ of the one-horned rhinos, the second largest
of the five species of rhinos.
   Rhino horns remain in great demand in Asia and the Middle East,
where they are carved into dagger handles or ground to dust to be
sold as an aphrodesiac. Consequently, wanton hunting and poaching
had depleted their number to about 100 in the Chitwan area.
   In 1967, an aerial survey by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization estimated that only 90 to 108 rhions
remained in Chitwan, and only 5 percent of the females had calves _
an indication their number was declining.
   Nepalese officials implemented strict measures to protect the
animals, and their numbers increased to between 350 and 370 in 1986.
Officials also found 70 percent of the females had calves, a sign of
healthy growth in the population.
   The King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation, a non-profit
organization dedicated to preserving natural heritage of Nepal, had
conducted research works on the habit and habitat of rhinoceroses in
collaboration with Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C.
   The American and Nepalese experts monitored individual rhino's
movement with radio collaring.
   The people involved in the preparation of the ``operation rhino''
to translocate the huge animals used dart guns with immobilizing
drugs to capture and cage them.
   The cages then were lifted by a crane onto trucks. A drive of
more than 20 hours took the convoy to the Bardia district.
   When the trucks reached their destination, experts brought in
elephants to make the rhinos feel at home.
   When the cages were opened, however, the rhinos charged and the
elephants fled.
   ``Our elephants had never seen rhinos before,'' said a villager.

<HEAD>Study Finds New Religions Aren't Declining But Increasing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New religions that have proliferated in America
in the last two decades aren't fading away as they had been widely
expected to do, but instead are growing and multiplying.
   This is the finding of research by The Rev. J. Gordon Melton of
Santa Barbara, Calif., director of the Institute for the Study of
American Religions.
   ``Non-conventional religion in the United States has flourished
for a generation, continues to grow and is transforming America,
religiously, into a radically pluralistic culture,'' he says.
   ``The anti-cult movement...has had no measureable affect on the
development of the unconventional religions'' which in the last
decade ``have continued to grow, consolidate gains and expand.''
   An authority on the country's increasingly wide religious
spectrum and editor of the Encyclopedia of American Religions,
Melton says scholarly assumptions had been that new religions soon
would die out.
   But that simply has proved not to be the case, he says, either
nowadays when they've cropped up profusely, or in the past.
   He says fresh data collected on 835 new religions formed since
1940, most of them in the last 20 years, only 125 now are defunct,
while most have shown a decade-by-decade growth.
   In a paper presented at a meeting of the American Academy of
Religion in Chicago last weekend, he said:
   ``While some groups have experienced ups and downs, most...have
shown a pattern of continued high-level recruitment of new members,
net growth and geographical spread.''
   Melton, a United Methodist, over the last year surveyed U.S.
religion groups for a new edition of the religion encyclopedia to be
published in December. It describes 1,586 U.S. faiths, old and new.
   He said there have been numerous false assumptions about new
religions that have ``attained the status of truisms,'' including
these:
   _ That new religions, often called cults, mainly emerge in
periods of social turmoil.
   _ That they are transitory, depending on some charismatic leader,
and usually break up and gradually die out after the leader dies.
   _ That they are ``deviant, weird and largely irrelevant religions
on the margins of culture.''
   Actually, he said, most of them are offshoots of older religions,
such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Theosophy, Spiritualism,
Adventism, Christian Science, Mormons or others.
   ``Most of those groups we refer to as cults are simply
representative ... of these older religious traditions which are
rapidly diffusing through the Western nations ...,'' he said.
   The most common misassumption, Melton said, has been that the new
religions were less than genuine and simply a passing phenomenon
that would disappear under social and legal pressure.
   ``The opposite seems to be the case,'' he said. ``As new
non-conventional religions continue to emerge, the older groups have
shown an amazing staying power.''
   He said the past ``framework for studying cults has viewed them
as small, ephemeral, disconnected and essentially a-historical
groups which exist on the margin of society, deviating from its
normative central core.''
   However, he said the survey shows ``a decade by decade growth in
the number of additional religious groups and no rapid delcine'' of
older groups.
   ``While a few non-conventional religions do in fact come and go
quickly, and while most pass through unstable phases especially in
their first generation, the great majority which survive the first
decade continue to become stable organizations and long-term factors
in the religious ecology of their communities.''
   As for the idea that the groups gradually disappear after the
death of their charismatic leaders, Melton this hasn't generally
been the case.
   Citing cases of various groups whose founder-leader had died,
such as Scientology, the Way International, Hare Krishnas, Alamo
Christian Foundation and International Buddhist Meditation Center,
Melton said:
   ``Each group passed through a brief period of
mourning...Completely absent were any signs of significant internal
turmoil and noteworthy problems with a transition of authority.''
   He said another widely held misassumption was that new religions
grew out of social turmoil such as in the l960's.
   In fact, he said, ``the exact opposite seems to be the case.''
Citing figures from his survey, he said the marked rise in new
religions began in the 1950's but increased in each decade since
then up to the present.
   He said immigration also has increased Moslems, Buddhists and
Hindus in America _ not counted among new religions _ but the new
religions often derive from the older Asian traditions.
   While the new groups may have little impact themselves, he said
that combined with the immigration influx, ``they are participating
in the reorientation of American religious life away from an
exclusively Judeo-Christian format.''

predicts more than 500,000 arrests in the movement in the next 12

   In a story in the Christian Herald, a non-denominational monthly

tension and strain about the issue to the point that abortion is
again outlawed.
   About 9,000 people have been arrested in the movement in the last
six months, about l,000 of them in Atlanta.
   Robert K. Skolrood, executive director of the National Legal

<HEAD>It's That USDA Outlook Time of Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of government and private experts are
poring over computer print-outs and maybe a crystal ball or two as
they prepare for the Agriculture Department's 65th annual
Agricultural Outlook Conference this week.
   These experts will outline their 1989 forecasts for farmers,
consumers and world traders. But the experts usually hedge their
predictions, just in case.
   A year ago, for example, none foresaw the devastating drought
that swept across much of the nation in the spring of 1988 or the
economic grief it caused for hard-pressed farmers trying to recover
from earlier financial troubles.
   For others whose crops escaped severe damage from summer heat and
drought, the year turned out profitably as market prices of wheat,
feed grains and soybeans climbed in response to reduced supplies.
   This week's conference, which begins on Tuesday and concludes at
mid-day Thursday, will attract hundreds of onlookers.
   They will represent both the public and private sectors,
including information specialists, market analysts, lobbyists,
consultants, advisers, congressional staffers and others whose
livelihoods depend on up-to-date, accurate information.
   Nearly all will be watching for new signs or projections that may
direct their paths in 1989, any indication of trends ending,
beginning or continuing.
   The USDA's role in national statistics and economics goes back to
its official beginnings during the Civil War. Gradually, as Congress
expanded the department's functions and authority, expert
information became a precious commodity in itself, to be made public
and distributed widely.
   In 1922, under the guidance of Agriculture Secretary Henry C.
Wallace (whose son, Henry A. Wallace, would one day also become
secretary of agriculture), the department began a world survey of
agricultural conditions.
   A new Bureau of Agricultural Economics was created and ``a
movement got under way to make available to farmers the results of
economic research to aid them in planning production and marketing
for the coming year,'' says one USDA history.
   The first outlook conference was held April 20-21, 1923. It was
so popular that another was held on July 11-12 the same year.
   Early emphasis at the conferences was ``pretty heavy on crops''
and the outlook for planting, USDA historian Doug Bowers said in a
telephone interview. And the repeat of meetings in July was only a
one-shot deal, he said.
   Annual outlook conferences were held thereafter, mostly in the
fall, when farmers began looking ahead to the following spring's
planting and other work.
   The fall scheduling held until the late 1960s and early 1970s,
Bowers said. At that time, the outlook meetings were shifted to
February.
   ``That worked out better for some economic numbers but didn't
help farmers very much,'' Bowers said. ``It didn't last long.''
   Beginning in the early 1970s, when the Soviet Union roared to
life as a big buyer of U.S. grain, the annual conferences have
included a heavy agenda of discussion on world trade and its
importance to the United States.
   Other topical changes were made to include talks, papers, panel
discussions and thick reports on human nutrition, rural poverty,
housing, food stamps, federal inspection of food products,
transportation, environmental issues and family finances.
   In recent years, farm credit, exports, water quality,
conservation and trade negotiations have been high on the list.
   Meantime, conference workshops and sessions still include the
latest outlooks for farm commodities, the crops and livestock
products that are the main stem of the agricultural economy.
   This year's conference format follows pretty much the scheduling
of recent years, with some of the most important material on tap the
opening day.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, who has said he will
retire with the Reagan administration in January, will open the
conference.
   Wayne D. Angell, member of the board of governors of the Federal
Reserve System, will offer a general economic outlook for 1989. He
will be followed by James R. Donald, chairman of the USDA's World
Agricultural Outlook Board, with a look at the U.S. and world
agricultural situation.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg will talk about
prospects for agricultural trade.
   On the final day of the conference, experts will discuss the
significance of this year's drought on 1989 operations, including
the drought's impact on U.S. policies and programs.
   The Farm Credit System and the restructuring of Farmers Home
Administration loans also will be on the Thursday morning program,
along with U.S. Trade Repesentative Clayton Yeutter, who will
discuss trade negotiations and other trade issues.

<HEAD>LeVar Burton Travels From `Star Trek' Future to `Roots' Past</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LeVar Burton has been living in the Star Trek
future for the last year, but he returns to the past to reprise his
role as Kunta Kinte in ABC's ``Roots: The Gift.''
   The two-hour Christmas special on Dec. 11 reunites Kunta with
Fiddler, the crafty, aging slave played by Louis Gossett Jr., for
the first time since ``Roots'' became a landmark miniseries 12 years
ago.
   Burton, who now stars as Lt. Geordi La Forge in the immensely
successful ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' made his acting debut
as the young Mandinka warrior snatched from his home in Africa and
forced into slavery in the American colonies.
   ``I'm glad this is the last time I'll play this character,'' said
Burton. ``I didn't have any fun. It was hard, for a lot of reasons.
First of all, I personally am not a fan of the 1700s. I hate the
1700s. It was not a bright spot in terms of the human condition. It
was a time of ignorance, and for Kunta it was an especially bad time.
   ``We pick up the story seven years after he arrived in this
country and four years after you last saw me in the role in `Roots.'
We start with the whipping scene and use the film from the original
show.''
   Burton added: ``For me, Kunta was always a proud, brave, strong
African warrior. And when we first see him in this show that flame
is all but gone. Spiritually and emotionally, he's in pain. And for
me to portray that, I'm in pain. I have a strong identification with
this character. There are some areas in our lives where we just
overlap.''
   In the movie, Kunta, who is hungering for freedom, becomes
involved with the underground railroad smuggling slaves out of the
South. Fiddler is reluctant to jeopardize the privileges he has
spent a lifetime earning, yet becomes Kunta's fellow worker on the
railroad.
   ``Roots: The Gift,'' set at Christmastime 1775, also stars Avery
Brooks as a ``free man of color,'' Shaun Cassidy as a secret
Southern abolitionist running the railroad, Kate Mulgrew as a
runaway slave catcher, and John McMartin and Michael Learned as
Cassidy's slave-owning parents.
   Burton in some ways sees himself as a modern-day Kunta Kinte, the
free man of Africa.
   ``There is a direct thread between Kunta and Geordi, and I am in
the middle,'' he said. ``If I were playing my own life story I'd be
playing a Kunta of the '80s. I have a great life. I have the most
charmed existence in this life. This year has been the most
rewarding financially for me in 12 years as an actor. I'm doing
`Star Trek,' I did `Roots: The Gift' and I'm doing my PBS series
`Reading Rainbow.'''
   In the current season of ``Star Trek,'' Burton's character has
been promoted from helmsman-navigator to chief engineer.
   ``Geordi will have more authority and more responsibility,'' he
said. ``This will give him more physical presence. Last year they
had to introduce a new cast, so the focus went to Captain Picard,
Data and Riker. Geordi never had that particular expertise to
contribute. It was important to find his niche.
   ``We came up with this promotion and it solves a lot of problems.
I now have a better working schedule for one thing. The first two
days of each shooting schedule are bridge days, and since I'm rarely
on the bridge now I have those days off.''
   Burton said he doubts that he will have much time during next
year's hiatus except to work on ``Reading Rainbow.'' The writers
strike last summer has pushed the production schedule back.
   He is not signed for any future projects but has his eye on a
feature film being prepared by George Lucas on the black ``Tuskegee
airmen'' of World War II.
   ``The project's been kicking around for 12 years,'' he said. ``I
hope that when it finally comes up it'll coincide with my hiatus. I
really want to be in on this. It's a terrific story of the black
pilots nobody wanted. They were put into their own fighter squadron
and had the best kill ratio in the war. Then they were completely
ignored by the country they served.''

   Sharp increases for fall and winter clothing
have put consumer price inflation back in the 5 percent annual range
last month despite the smallest monthly increase in food costs since
February, according to the government.
   The Labor Department reported Tuesday that consumer prices rose
0.4 percent in October, or at an annual rate of 5.1 percent.
   More than half of the gain came from a 1.8 percent boost in
apparel prices and sharp increases in auto insurance and financing
charges.

   The Reagan administration has issued its final

efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   The administration also was optimistic on the outlook for
inflation, and predicted it would ease next year.

   The federal government started its fiscal year
by posting a $27.4 billion budget deficit in October, the largest
since March but down 10.9 percent from a year earlier, the Treasury
Department reports.
   The $3.4 billion decline from October 1987 was more than
accounted for by a $2.3 billion drop in farm subsidy payments and a
$2.6 billion shrinkage in military pay, which was artificially high
last year, the department said Tuesday.

   Your chances of finding a cheap air fare are a
lot smaller today than they were a day earlier.
   The nation's biggest airlines said Tuesday they are going through
with previously-disclosed plans to boost most of their lowest
discount air fares and eliminate the cheap fares that can be booked
a few days before a flight.
   The changes, announced last week, would revamp the popular
advance-purchase ``MaxSaver'' fares used by most vacation travelers.
They would also drop the so-called ``junk fares'' available four to
seven days before a flight, which are used mainly by business
travelers.
   The changes went into effect at midnight Tuesday.
   Carriers adopting the changes include United Airlines, American
Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Trans World Airlines Inc. and Delta
Air Lines.
   Under the MaxSaver changes, fares for longer flights generally
will be raised while those for shorter hauls will mostly be reduced.
That means roughly two-thirds of the fares will go up, while the
remainder will fall.
   The new formula based on flight mileage replaces the airlines'
past practice of setting fares according to competition on
individual routes.
   The changes in MaxSaver fares generally range from a $20
reduction to a $40 increase on a round-trip ticket.
   ``We have been heavily inundated with phone calls,'' said David
Perelman, president of DMS Travel Inc. in midtown Manhattan.
   He noted that the demise of the last-minute junk fares means, for
example, that a passenger flying from Newark, N.J., to Kansas City,
Mo., would pay $296 round trip if he booked Tuesday on a three-day
advance basis. But as of Wednesday, the cheapest round-trip fare for
the same trip will be $757, Perelman said.
   There are some exceptions to the changes. American Airlines, for
example, said it won't go along with them in those cities where it
competes with Midway Airlines, a smaller carrier that didn't match
the changes.
   Similarly, Texas Air Corp. subsidiary Eastern Airlines doesn't
plan to make the changes in the highly competitive market linking
the Northeast and Florida. Delta will put off making the revisions
in that market as long as Eastern does, said Delta spokesman Jim
Lundy in Atlanta.
   But a substantial majority of discount fares will be adjusted.
   The changes were initiated by Continental Airlines and quickly
matched by the other big carriers, which were emboldened by strong
recent growth in passenger traffic.
   Continental, another Texas Air subsidiary, customarily has been a
pacesetter in cutting fares. But the stronger traffic has spurred it
to switch directions.
   The airline used to slash fares to attract more passengers, and
its moves quickly were mimicked by the other big carriers in an
effort to remain competitive. Now, Continental's improving traffic
has made it a leader in fare hikes rather than cuts, at least for
the moment.
   Airline analysts stress that the big test of the airlines'
strength will come in January and February, when passenger traffic
is seasonally weak.

<HEAD>Survey Says 90 Percent of Big Companies Receive Complaints</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A survey about workplace sex harassment suggests
90 percent of big corporations get complaints from female employees
and that the problem is costing the average major company $6.7
million a year in expenses.
   At the same time, the survey released Tuesday suggested, most
corporate employers neglect easy and inexpensive methods for
eradicating sexual harassment, and relatively few complaints are
lodged.
   ``Women are still not complaining early enough because it's not
safe to complain,'' said Freada Klein, a management consultant who
analyzed the survey conducted by Working Woman magazine and
published in its December edition. ``Harassment tends to escalate if
it's not stopped promptly.''
   Among other significant findings, the survey found more than a
third of the 160 companies that responded had been sued by victims,
a quarter had been sued repeatedly, and two-thirds of complaints are
made against immediate supervisors and upper management.
   In addition, major companies spend an average of $6.7 million a
year in sex-harassment related costs. Ms. Klein said the figure was
calculated based on costs of absenteeism, low productivity and
employee turnover.
   In 1987, a record $3.2 million was paid by one company, K mart
Corp., to settle a single sexual harassment case.
   Working Woman called the survey the first scientific sampling of
sex harassment at major U.S. companies.
   It said the results ``offer important lessons about the high cost
companies pay for ignoring the problem and provide a sobering look
at how widespread legal problems concerning sexual harassment have
become.''
   The survey said the overwhelming number of incidents were
reported by women complaining about unwanted attention from men.
   A law banning sexual discrimination is part of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act but was not enforced or defined until the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission published guidelines to help
companies conform to the law in 1980.
   The commission said sexual harassment is any unwelcome sexual
advance, request for sexual favors and other verbal or physical
conduct of a sexual nature that is connnected to employment
decisions or that establishes an intimidating, hostile or offensive
working environment.
   ``This is no longer the stereotypical old boss chasing the pretty
young secretary around the desk,'' said Anne Mollegen Smith, Working
Woman editor in chief. ``If companies don't deal with it better,
this is a financial time bomb for American business.''
   The survey suggested many companies are responding to the
problem, at least partly because they fear the adverse publicity and
litigation costs associated with harassment complaints. Two out of
10 offenders are eventually discharged and others are given verbal
or written warnings, the survey found.
   Personnel, human resources and equal opportunity officers who
represent 3.3 million employees at 160 of the nation's 1,000 biggest
corporations responded to the magazine's 49-question survey.
   Working Woman is a monthly published by the Working
Woman-McCall's group of New York.

   Here are examples of questions about what
constitutes sex harassment, contained in a survey of major
corporations reported Tuesday by Working Woman magazine.
   The questions present hypothetical situations and ask corporate
personnel executives to say whether each constitutes sexual
harassment and to rate the severity. Answers are in parentheses:
   _A male supervisor asks a female staff member out on a date.
Although she refuses, he continues to ask her. Is this sexual
harassment? (Yes _ 97 percent; severe _ 23 percent; moderate _ 47

<HEAD>Nabisco Workers Face Uncertainty Of Multibillion-Dollar Bidding</HEAD>

   Antoni Noles wasn't that happy three years
ago when tobacco company R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc. bought
Nabisco Brands Inc., his employer at the factory that makes Animal
Crackers, Oreos and other cookies and crackers.
   ``Smoking and cookie-making don't really mix,'' said Noles, a
batter mixer from Ridgewood with 18 years at the company.
   For Noles, history is repeating itself with the $20 billion-plus
auction of RJR Nabisco Inc., which could result in the sale of
assets such as the cookie plant to pay for debt incurred by the
eventual purchaser.
   ``You don't know where you're going to go from here,'' Noles said.
   Echoing many of the workers interviewed Tuesday morning at the
plant's gates, Ed Nesbihal said he was taking the bidding battle one
day at a time. He said that's what happens ``when you're at the
bottom of the ladder and you got money men at the top.''
   Many at the plant have put in long stints. Nesbihal has spent 15
years, most recently as a grounds maintenance man.
   Nesbihal said employees at Fair Lawn generally were happy, having
weather the buyout by Reynolds, cost cutting that reduced the
1,400-strong workforce at the plant to about 800, and the continuing
threat of layoffs because of modernization.
   ``We enjoy working here. But it's not up to us whether we stay,''
he said.
   It could be up to one of three groups that may have to sell
assets.
   The bidders are senior RJR Nabisco managers backed by Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Inc.; Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.,
backed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co.; and
First Boston Corp. and Resource Holdings Inc. The bids all exceed
$21 billion.
   Art Scala of Haskill, who works in the plant's maintenance stock
room, said he hoped a new owner would take into account the welfare
of the company and its people, ``not just money.''
   The plant, one of nine Nabisco cookie and cracker factories, was
built in 1959. Less than 20 miles from New York City in affluent
Bergen County, the plant's prominent Nabisco sign looms over a busy
roadway and baking odors fill the air.
   The plant may be one of Nabisco's more secure operations because
it makes some of its best known products: Ritz crackers, Oreo
cookies and Fig Newtons.
   It also is the world's only source of Barnum's Animals crackers,
producing 50 million boxes a year, or 7 million cookies a day, said
Nabisco spokeswoman Caroline Fee at corporate offices in Parsippany.
   Nabisco has about 100 manufacturing facilities worldwide, with
about one-third of them in the United States. About half its 47,000
employees work overseas, Ms. Fee said.
   Noles said money has become a concern of many workers who feel
uncertainty because of the Wall Street bidding war.
   ``Everybody is mostly saving everything they can,'' he said.
Noles said that after the Reynolds purchase in 1985, management told
plant workers that it would be the last change in ownership.
   ``We don't know who to believe,'' he said.
   Not all who stopped outside the plant's gates were troubled by
the financial developments involving Nabisco.
   ``We've been producing,'' said Carl Vetter, a mixer who lives in
Butler. ``We don't see 'em,'' he said, referring to the company's
owners.

<HEAD>Group Says U.S. Participation in High Definition TV Market Critical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lackadaisical approach to developing
high definition television could have a ripple effect that would
doom several other key U.S. high technology industries, according to
a trade group.
   The technologies are so closely linked that failing to
aggressively pursue the high definition TV market _ which experts
predict will total $40 billion within 20 years _ could devastate the
U.S. share of the personal computer, semiconductor and automated
manufacturing equipment markets, according to an economic impact
study released Tuesday by the American Electronics Association.
   ``HDTV will provide the very lifeblood for existing and future
technologies,'' said Pat Hill Hubbard, vice president of the
industry group. ``Non-participation means a loss of both broad
technological know-how and an expanded potential for skilled
electronics employment.''
   Nations that take the lead in the emerging field will claim
leadership in research and development, design and manufacturing,
she said.
   The Japanese have spent $700 million on high definition
television technology in the last 20 years compared to the ``very
little'' spent by U.S. companies, said AEA spokesman John Hatch.
   The result of the research is a television picture with the
quality of a 35 millimeter photographic slide will be marketed for
between $3,000 and $5,000 by 1991 at the latest, Hatch said.
   ``We feel we have 5 to 10 years to catch up with the Japanese
market penetration because of the high cost...and the inability for
it to be shown on regular TVs,'' said Hatch.
   The Japanese high definition television uses a different
broadcasting standard than the U.S. standard and so will likely be
available initially only on cable, videotape recorders and
satellite, he said.
   Although the start-up costs are high and profits will be low or
non-existent for up to 10 years, the group called for cooperation in
the field by industry, government and academia in order to preserve
U.S. competitiveness.
   ``It's a case of putting up a pretty hefty investment and not
getting anything back for 5 to 10 years,'' said Hatch. ``U.S.
companies are not used to that so it's going to take a different
mindset.''
   Hubbard called the report a ``working document'' that is subject
to refinement. But she said the trends were clear.
   The U.S. share of the personal computer market would drop from 70
percent currently to 35 percent by the year 2010 if U.S. firms
obtain less than 10 percent of the high definition television
market, the report said. To maintain its 70 percent market share,
the U.S. must claim 50 percent of the new television market, the
report said.
   Similarly, the U.S. share of the world's automated manufacturing
equipment market could drop from the current 35 percent to 28
percent unless the United States holds 30 percent of the new
television market.
   And the United States' semiconductor market share would drop from
41 percent to 21 percent by 2010 if the U.S. fails to capture more
than 10 percent of the emerging market.
   The AEA represents 3,500 high technology firms throughout the
country.

   The dollar drifted lower in early European trading
today. Gold prices also fell slightly.
   Trading volume was low, with Japanese markets closed for a
national holiday and many American traders expected to head home
early for Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
   ``People are scared of the banks coming in,'' said one trader in
Milan, Italy, recalling last week's coordinated intervention by
central banks to prop up the American currency.
   Dollar rates in London at midmorning, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.7220 West German marks, down from
1.7230; 1.4475 Swiss francs, down from 1.4545; 5.8840 French francs,
down from 5.9090; 1.9426 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9480; 1,279.50
Italian lire, down from 1,285.00; and 1.2015 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2002.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8312 compared with $1.8305
late Tuesday.
   The dollar was also quoted in London at 121.55 yen, compared with
121.78 yen in Tokyo at the end of Tuesday's business day.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $418.30 a troy ounce,
down from $419.65 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $417.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $418.00, down from $418.90 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.83 to close at a bid $419.87.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.10 a troy ounce,
down slightly from Tuesday's $6.11.

<HEAD>President Devalues Currency By 50 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The embattled government of President Alan
Garcia devalued Peru's currency by 50 percent and imposed other
severe austerity measures to meet the country's worsening economic
crisis.
   Economy Minister Abel Salinas announced the measures in a
nationwide television address Tuesday.
   Salinas said the government would eliminate subsidies for basic
food products in stages over the next six months because it did not
have the money to finance them.
   The first reduction would be implemented immediately and would
double the prices of some food staples, Salinas said. He said the
measures are aimed at fighting inflation expected to reach 1,500
percent annually this year.
   Salinas said severe economic measures implemented in early
September, which included an 86-percent currency devaualtion, had
not succeeded in reducing the country's huge deficit.
   Independent economists estimate the deficit has since increased
from 16 percent to 18 percent of the gross national product.
   Salinas said the curency's official exchange rate was being
devalued from 250 intis per dollar to 500 intis per dollar to boost
exports and bring in badly needed dollars.
   The inti traded Tuesday on the parallel market _ a legal
free-market currency exchange _ for 625 to the dollar.
   To offset the measures' impact on the poor, the government
decreed an increase in the monthly minimum wage from 15,000 to
24,000 intis.
   Sporadic food rioting broke out after the September austerity
package was announced and rumors of a military coup have since
circulated.
   At one point, Garcia offerd to resign but was persuaded to stay
by leaders of his populist Aprista Party, according to senior
government officials.
   Garcia took office in 1985, gaining international attention when
he defiantly set a ceiling on the country's foreign debt payments
equal to 10 percent of export earnings.
   He used the money to generate record economic growth of 8.5
percent in 1986 and 6.7 percent in 1987, but Peru has exhausted its
hard currency reserves and the government has said the economy will
shrink by at least 6 percent this year.

<HEAD>Ferryboat Gambling Plan Again Afloat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state lawmaker says he wants to give a
whole new meaning to the term ``floating craps game'' by legalizing
ferryboat gambling on Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.
   State Sen. Joseph Andrea said Tuesday he would re-introduce a
measure to allow the gambling. And he said the odds of it passing
are good.
   The Democrat from the Lake Michigan port city of Kenosha said his
proposal would apply as soon as a ferry was 1,000 feet or more away
from Wisconsin's lakeshores.
   There now is only one ferry operation on the lakes. It runs on
Lake Michigan between Ludington, Mich., and Two Rivers, Wis.
   ``Ferryboat gambling would bring in waves of tourists to
Wisconsin,'' Andrea said. ``The additional tourist trade would be a
real boon to local businesses and to the state treasury.''
   In Wisconsin, allowing ferryboat gambling would require a
constitutional amendment, which would have to clear two successive
sessions of the Legislature and a statewide referendum.
   Voters last year approved amendments permitting a state lottery
and pari-mutuel gambling. Those proposals had passed successive
sessions of the Legislature, which begins a new session in January.
   The state lottery began operation in September, but plans for
pari-mutuel betting are still being worked out.
   Andrea lamented that a ferryboat gambling proposal several years
ago sank when a 59-36 vote shipped it to committee, and it never
re-emerged.

<HEAD>Output Grew At An Annual Rate Of 5 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's real gross domestic product, measured by
the output of goods and services, rose 1.4 percent in the third
quarter from the previous three months and was up 5 percent from the
same period a year ago, the government said Wednesday.
   The Central Statistics Office said its output-based index of GDP,
which uses a 1985 base of 100, rose to a seasonally adjusted 114.3
in the third quarter from 112.8 in the second quarter and 108.9 in
the third quarter of 1987.
   Because the figures are rounded off, the percentage changes
provided by the office often differ from those worked out from the
indexes.
   Service and distribution businesses grew especially strongly in
the third quarter, with energy output falling as a result of the
fire on the Piper Alpha oil platform in the North Sea in July, the
office said.
   The output-based GDP is considered the most reliable guide to
short-term movements in the economy.
   Britain also calculates GDP based on expenditure and income data
and publishes an average estimate of the three GDP measures, which
is considered the best guide to long-term movements in the economy.

<HEAD>British Steel To Be Sold For 2.5 Billion Pounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares in British Steel PLC will be offered to the
public at 125 pence, or $2.29 each, valuing the state-owned steel
maker at 2.5 billion pounds or the equivalent of $4.6 billion, the
government said Wednesday.
   Closing date for applications for the 2 billion shares being
offered is Dec. 2.
   Dealings in the shares are due to commence simultaneously in
London, New York and Toronto on Dec. 5, the government said in
disclosing details of the previously announced privatization.
   Privatization is a process whereby ownership of a company held by
the government is transferred to the public.
   The share price was at the bottom end of market expectations that
ranged from 125 pence to 140 pence, or $2.56.
   Analysts said the government was likely to set a low price to
ensure a successful sale for the first privatization since the
government's troubled sale of its remaining stake in British
Petroleum PLC, which coincided with the 1987 stock crash.
   The market price of existing BP shares fell below the offering
price of the new shares, killing the incentive for investors to buy
the newly issued stock, which was left in the hands of underwriters.
   ``There has been an excellent response to the share offer
roadshows in the U.K. and around the world,'' said Paul Richards, a
director at the London investment firm Samuel Montagu & Co. Ltd.,
advisers to the government on the sale.
   ``The offer has been fully underwritten and we are confident of a
successful sale.''
   The British Steel sale also precedes some of the biggest and most
complex privatization attempts to date, as the government moves to
sell off Britain's water and electricity industries beginning late
next year.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government has
sold off billions of pounds worth of state assets since she came
into power in 1979. Her aim in selling off such companies as Jaguar
PLC, British Gas PLC, and British Airways PLC has been to promote
capitalism and share ownership.
   The British Steel shares will be payable in two installments. A
first payment of 60 pence, $1.10, a share will be made on
application and an additional 65 pence, $1.19, a share paid by
September 1989. There is a minimum size application of 400 shares.
   British Steel has forecast pretax profit for the current year
ending April 1989 of at least 550 million pounds, or $1.01 billion,
up 31 percent from last year.
   About 23 percent of the shares will be offered to the British
public and to British Steel employees and pensioners. British
institutional investors will initially be offered 44 percent of the
shares. The remaining 33 percent of the shares are to be offered in
the United States, Canada, Japan and continental Europe.

<HEAD>Chrysler Sells Out of Spirit and Acclaims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has received orders
for 60 percent more Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim cars than the
company will be able to build, a Chrysler executive says.
   Production of the new four-door sedans began a month ago at
Chrysler's Newark, Del., plant and the cars are sold out for the
model year, Chrysler Motors Corp. Chairman Bennett Bidwell said in
an interview Tuesday.
   ``Maybe the last time I was able to say it with some finality was
with minivans. That's kind of a nice feeling,'' said Bidwell, who
was named chairman of Chrysler's car-making arm Nov. 10.
   Chrysler began the recent popularity wave of minivans with the
introduction of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager in 1983. More
than half of the vehicles sold in the United States are made by
Chrysler.
   ``Our only problems (with Spirit and Acclaim) today would relate
to production volumes,'' Bidwell said.
   The Delaware plant had been shut down for 16 weeks while the
company completed $205 million in renovations.
   ``On the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim we've got fleet orders
on the order of magnitude of 40,000,'' he said. ``We've got dealer
orders over and above that for about 160,000.''
   But Chrysler will be able to build less than 125,000, he said.
   Bidwell also talked about the company's joint venture with
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., incentives and the possibility of Chrysler
going to private ownership or being a takeover target.
   Chrysler and Mitsubishi began producing cars at their
Diamond-Star Motors plant in Normal, Ill., on Sept. 1. Production
will be split, for now, half and half between Plymouth Laser and
Mitsubishi Eclipse.
   Bidwell said that mix may change, depending on dealer demand, and
since Chrysler has a larger dealership network than Mitsubishi's, it
stands to sell more of the cars.
   ``We won't hit any real kind of a stride until May,'' he said.
``We'll be building something on the order of 20,000 Plymouth
Lasers. ...
   Despite the apparent success of the Spirit-Acclaim and the Laser,
Chrysler still faces some rough financial roads, Bidwell said.
   ``I think if we had these two vehicles (from Diamond-Star and the
Newark plants) available in volume production today, we would be
able to hold and perhaps even further improve market share,'' he
said.
   However, with the discontinuation of some of the company's older
models, ``we're in a little bit of a transition over the next four
or five months ... when we're going to have to struggle a little
bit.''
   Chrysler's third-quarter earnings this year fell 54.3 percent
compared with the third quarter of last year. Through the first nine
months of the year, the company's earnings were down 34.4 percent
this year from the same period last year.
   One of the reasons is incentives.
   Chrysler has used the enticements to lure car buyers into
showrooms and to move excess stock from dealership inventory lots.
They took their toll on profits.
   Now, said Bidwell: ``We don't anticipate leading an incentive
parade.''
   Bidwell discounted rumors that the company may go to private
ownership or be in the bull's eye of a takeover target.
   ``Anybody would be crazy to take on that kind of debt load, and
still turn around and face the capital expenditure requirements that
you've got to do to stay in business in this business.''

<HEAD>EEC Puts Number Of Poor At 44 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
Commission said Wednesday 44 million people in the EEC, or 14
percent of the EEC's population, are considered poor.
   They ``earn less than half the average per capita income'' of the
country in which they live, the EEC said in a report.
   It said the increase in poverty was ``due to growing
unemployment, under-employment and unstable and underpaid work as
well as the increase in single parent families.''
   But the report warns that the figure of 44 million is imprecise
as poverty is not only a matter of income. Other factors include
quality of housing, lack of education, access to public services and
the quality of the work environment.
   The Commission said it lacks enough data about these factors to
make a fair EEC-wide comparison and thus uses only income as a
measure of poverty.
   Based on income only, the number of poor has risen in recent
years in all 12 EEC nations, said the report. It gave no figures.
   In all EEC nations old people form the largest group among the
poor, said the report.
   In the 1985-89 period, the EEC contributes a modest 29 million
European currency units $35 million to 91 projects in all EEC
nations aimed at alleviating conditions for the unemployed, single
parents, migrants and refugees and urban poor.
   The list is topped by Spain where EEC funds aid 16 social
projects.
   Britain is second with 15 projects followed by Portugal (10),
Ireland and Italy (both 9), France (7), Belgium, Denmark and Greece
(6 each), Luxembourg (3), West Germany (2) and the Netrherlands (1).

<HEAD>Burlington Northern Acknowledges Insider Trading Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burlington Northern Inc., which includes the
nation's largest rail system, is under investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for possible insider trading,
company officials say.
   Don Pope of the holding company said Tuesday the ``informal,
routine investigation'' began shortly after an announcement June 2
that Burlington Northern was splitting in two.
   The probe was sparked by an ``abnormally high trading volume''
before the move, especially on May 17 and 23, he said.
   Pope said corporate attorneys told him that although they don't
know the focus of the investigation, they have ``no indications''
that any Burlington Northern officer is a subject of the probe.
   Burlington Northern Railroad separated from energy, timber and
real estate operations, which were spun off into a new concern,
Burlington Resources.
   On July 7, in accordance with an earlier announcement, 20 million
common shares representing 13 percent of Burlington Resources were
sold at $25.50 a share. The remaining 87 percent of the shares are
to be distributed to Burlington Northern shareholders Dec. 31.
   Analysts said the move was intended to boost the value of
Burlington Northern stock and make a takeover bid less likely.
   Burlington Northern chairman Richard M. Bresler has said the
split was arranged partly because companies in one line of business
had become preferred over conglomerates.
   ``The objective here is to enhance shareholder value by creating
two very viable companies _ one in transportation and one in
resources,'' he told The New York Times on June 3.
   Illegal insider trading could result in civil action by the SEC,
criminal charges brought by the Justice Department or both.
   Burlington Northern is cooperating in the probe and has hired the
Washington, D.C., law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &
Jacobson, which represented former Wall Street mega-speculator Ivan
Boesky in a record $100 million insider trading settlement with the
SEC, he added.
   On May 23 Burlington Northern Inc. was listed as the 13th most
active stock on the New York Stock Exchange with 734,900 shares
traded and closed at $57.875, down $2.375.
   On May 17 the stock missed the most active list with a volume of
273,800 shares and closed at $62.25, down $1.625.
   On June 2, when the spinoff was announced, volume was about 2.7
million shares as the stock rose $1.75 to close at $69.125.
   SEC investigators have requested ``information on the events
leading up to the announcement,'' Pope said
   In addition, James Schropp of Fried, Frank, said investigators
requested the names of all Burlington Northern officials who were
involved in the deal and questioned William Pontius, vice president
of Glacier Park Co., the main real estate subsidiary.
   Pontius was not accused of any wrongdoing but was asked about
people outside the company who might have been involved in trading,
Schropp said.
   ``It was felt that Mr. Pontius could shed light on that
question,'' he said without elaborating.

   The stock market headed higher today in quiet
pre-Thanksgiving trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.91 to 2,081.61 in
the first half hour this morning.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 519 up, 314 down and

   In the economic news, the Commerce Department reported that new
factory orders for durable goods increased 2.4 percent in October.
The gain was concentrated in defense orders, which are traditionally
volatile, and had little visible effect on stocks.
   Energy issues were steady to higher on reports that suggested the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was getting closer to
agreement on a production-quota plan aimed at bolstering world oil
prices.

<HEAD>Feds End Search Of Blinder, Robinson; Craps Table, Slot Machine
Seized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents have ended a four-day
search of financial records at Blinder, Robinson & Co., and police
revealed a craps table and slot machine were seized from the penny
stock brokerage firm.
   The company's staff of 150 were allowed to resume normal
operations on Tuesday, and Internal Revenue Service agents at the
end of the day finished examining thousands of documents concerning
16 companies and 53 investors.
   IRS and Securities and Exchange Commission agents entered
Blinder's office Saturday morning on a warrant issued by the U.S.
attorney's office in Denver, and they have refused to comment on the
raid. Blinder executives said the warrant was based on an affidavit
from an IRS agent in Las Vegas, Nev.
   No charges have been filed against Blinder, Robinson, and the
company's name did not appear on the search warrant.
   Police revealed Tuesday that they seized the expensive casino
craps table and nickel slot machine from brokerage owner Meyer
Blinder's 10th floor penthouse office during the weekend raid.
   While Blinder officials describe them as collector's items,
possession of the gambling devices could mean added trouble for the
penny-stock magnate.
   Blinder faces an investigation of a possible misdemeanor
violation of Colorado's gambling laws and deeper scrutiny from the
Nevada Gaming Commission, which is reviewing his license application
for the proposed Cattle Baron casino in Henderson, Nev., authorities
said.
   ``We'll wait and see what transpires with the feds in their
investigation,'' said police Detective Bob Arthur. ``We need to
determine who owns the table and the slot machine.''
   Steven Theys, senior vice president for Blinder, Robinson, said
the seizure showed an overzealousness on the part of federal agents.
   ``Yeah, it's real big-time gambling _ a whole nickel slot
machine,'' he said. ``I don't know what right they have to take that
because it wasn't covered in the search warrant. They took that out
of Mr. Blinder's personal den.''
   Arthur said that while it is not against the law to own a craps
table, possession of a slot machine manufactured after 1950 is
illegal. The machine seized in Blinder's penthouse was made in 1973,
he said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Higher on Reports of Soviet Grain Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that the United
States and the Soviet Union were preparing to sign a new long-term
grain sales agreement.
   The previous 5-year agreement expired on Sept. 30 and the lack of
a new pact has had a depressing effect on the grain markets,
especially on wheat prices.
   Analysts said today's early rally was prompted by a news
service's report that U.S. officials would travel to Moscow on
Monday to sign a 2-year agreement covering wheat and corn sales to
the Soviets.
   One of the sticking points in the negotiations has been a Soviet
demand that an agreement include wheat subsidies under the
Agriculture Department's Export Enhancement Program, said Ted Mao,
grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Technicalanalysts said the grain markets were due for a rally
after hitting the bottom of a price cycle on Monday.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 2} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.16\ a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.64 a bushel; oats were }
cent to 2 cents higher with December at $2.10 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 2} cents higher with January at $7.53 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were moderately higher of the brothel and
the days during which a customer could have been exposed.
   Russell Reed of the Nevada Brothel Industry said owners want to
keep their houses as free of sexually transmitted diseases as
possible but fear the notification rule might cause unfounded public
concern.
   Prostitutes in Nevada's three dozen brothels have been tested
weekly for AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases for about
two years. None has tested positive for the AIDS virus.

   Oil prices shot up again today after fluctuating
wildly on Tuesday in response to conflicting reports from Vienna,
where OPEC ministers are trying to negotiate a new production
agreement.
   In the first two hours of trading today, prices fluctuated
between 34 cents and 74 cents higher. At 11 a.m. EST, the January
contract was trading at $14.30 a barrel, up 44 cents, in brisk
trading.
   Prices started drooping on word that the OPEC ministers had
postponed until Thursday a full meeting of the cartel, analysts
said. The ministers have been meeting in small groups since Monday
and were scheduled to convene in full session later today.
   Analysts said the market was remaining optimistic that the OPEC
meeting would produce some type of agreement to limit oil output.
The current excess on world markets have kept prices weak.
   ``The market opened stronger on followthrough volume from
yesterday,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst with
E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc. ``It's basically optimistic
that OPEC is going to come up with an agreement. However, the
meeting has been postponed so there is a little uneasiness.''
   Analysts said volume on the New York Mercantile Exchange was
heavier than normal in the first hour of trading but had tapered
off. The exchange is scheduled to close earlier than normal today in
advance of the Thanksgiving Day holiday and will be closed on Friday.
   On Tuesday, the January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, closed 88 cents higher at $13.86 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract had traded
as high as $14.40 a barrel during the day.
   Other contract months also finished sharply higher.
   Futures prices for refined products also soared on Tuesday. The
December contract for unleaded gasoline settled 1.01 cents higher at
45.33 cents a gallon. Contracts for next July and August closed 1.99
cents higher.
   Heating oil for December closed the day up 1.97 cents at 45.44
cents a gallon. Other contract months also rose, with next
September's contract up 2.40 cents.
   The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
trying to reach an agreement to limit output and raise world crude
prices. But Iran and Iraq have been unable to settle a dispute over
how much Iraq should be allowed to produce, a key hurdle to any
accord.
   Analysts said Iran Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh's remark
that, ``I think we can reach an agreement'' ignited an early buying
frenzy, as many investors and analysts were talking of a possible
impasse at the Vienna meeting, which continued today.
   ``It just goes to show how volatile this market is that prices
could go up more than $1 on just a little optimism from Iran,'' said
Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   But in a reversal late in the day, Aghazadeh said he would
``never concede'' to quota parity.
   That remark sent crude prices tumbling more than $1 off their
highs in the final hour of trading, but prices rebounded before the
close.
   ``Virtually all the action particularly these sharp reversals can
be traced to the statements of Iran's oil minister,'' said Bob
Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   OPEC's current production system gives Iran a quota of 2.4
million barrels of oil a day, compared with 1.5 million for Iraq,
with which it fought a bitter 8-year war. But Iraq has ignored its
quota, saying it will not participate until it is given parity with
Iran, which has refused.
   Analysts cite three reasons for Iran's intransigence:
   _Historically, it has been a higher volume producer than Iraq and
wants to maintain its No. 2 position behind Saudi Arabia in the
cartel.
   _Iran claims its internal needs are higher since its population
is triple that of Iraq.
   _It claims it has more oil reserves than Iraq, one of the
criteria used by OPEC to set its quotas.
   Although Iraq is producing more than 2.4 million barrels of oil a
day and has said it will continue, analysts have predicted some kind
of an agreement beyond strict parity is possible.

<HEAD>Dealmaker Sandy Weill Doesn't Forget Where He Came From</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA STOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A picture of a simple yellow house in Brooklyn
hangs in the plush Manhattan offices of entrepreneur Sanford I.
Weill, who grew up on the home's second floor.
   The 55-year-old Weill also recalls his struggles to pay the
milkman and the diaper service as a young career man who married
straight out of college.
   Such memories provide the inspiration that propels this Wall
Street dealmaker, who having built and sold one financial empire is
trying to work another miracle.
   Weill says the pending merger of his Commercial Credit Inc. with
Primerica Corp., headed by his old friend Gerald Tsai Jr., is as
much of a challenge as starting out more than 30 years ago.
   ``When I started I was really scraping and when we decided to get
into business, we (he and his wife Joan) put all of our money into
it except $1,000,'' said Weill. ``I think doing something like this
merger gives us the opportunity to do that again.''
   That first business was Carter, Berlind, Potoma & Weill, which
grew steadily through mergers and became what is today the giant
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   It was only the first big success for Weill, whose initial job
out of Cornell University was as a messenger in a brokerage firm. He
moved on to become a ``quote boy'' and later a stockbroker before
going into business himself.
   He sold Shearson to American Express for nearly $1 billion in
stock in 1981. Shortly after that, Weill joined American Express and
became president. There he played a major role in the company's
attempt to turn around its troubled Fireman's Fund, a large property
and liability insurer. He left American Express in 1985.
   He participated in _ but dropped out of _ bidding for E.F. Hutton
Inc., which was eventually purchased by his former firm, Shearson
Lehman.
   In 1986, Weill lost an attempt to acquire BankAmerica Corp. But
later in the year, he joined Baltimore-based Commercial Credit after
reaching an agreement with Control Data Corp. to spin off its
subsidiary in a public stock offering.
   Analysts say the Commercial Credit-Primerica transaction marks
the re-emergence of Weill as a major force in financial services.
Some say Weill is determined to build Commercial Credit into a giant
rivaling American Express, with interests in a wide range of
consumer credit and retail brokerage services.
   Weill says he entered the market now for the fun and challenge of
the turbulent times in the financial industry, which is still trying
to right itself after the shock of last year's stock market crash.
   ``I think I'm going to have a lot of fun,'' Weill said. ``I like
to keep busy and work with bright people,'' he said, adding that
``the best time to do something, not necessarily for the immediate
results, is when there's some sort of turmoil in the marketplace.''
   Weill also scoffs at reports that he left American Express
because he was not selected chief executive officer.
   ``The person was younger than I am and had different talents and
different abilities,'' Weill said. We just had a different
philosophy about management style and we agreed to disagree.''
   He says he doesn't look at the incident as a failure.
   ``I thought it was great to be president of American Express. ...
I grew up in Brooklyn in this house,'' he said pointing to the
photograph of his modest boyhood home.
   ``It's absolutely true that I was disappointed or I wouldn't have
left American Express. But it doesn't say any place that life has to
be a bowl of cherries,'' he said.
   Those who know Weill are watching his latest moves with interest.
   ``Sandy Weill has had an extremely successful career and he seems
to be capping it off with a very interesting and exciting
transaction,'' said Jeffrey Lane, president of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   ``Normally one judges the ability to succeed based on past
performance and given Sandy's past, one should assume the odds are
in his favor,'' Lane said. ``The task is certainly daunting ...
(and) his record is outstanding.''
   Anthony Pearce-Batten, securities analyst with Legg Mason Wood
Walker, Inc. in Baltimore, describes Weill as fairly conservative
``who doesn't over pay for anything,'' a detail man and one who
keeps an eye on the big picture in the industry.
   Looking at Weill's decision to leave American Express and his
failure to buy BankAmerica and E.F. Hutton, Pearce-Batten said:
``They speak well of the man. He is not driven to buy something at
any price. And, clearly he is not someone who spends a lot of time
in the headlines.
   ``I get the sense that price comes before pride.''
   Commercial Credit agreed to acquire Primerica in a cash-and-stock
deal valued at $1.65 billion. Along with Primerica, comes the
struggling brokerage firm Smith, Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   The revival of Smith Barney, a mid-sized investment bank
specializing in retail brokerage and municipal finance, is
considered key to the future success of Commercial Credit. Frank
Zarb, a prominent Wall Street figure who served as energy czar under
President Gerald Ford, was recently named to head the brokerage.
   Pearce-Batten says some on Wall Street are skeptical about
Weill's chances for success, noting that Commercial Credit's stock
has weakened sharply since the deal was announced.
   ``The simple way to put it _ and I don't suggest this is the way
I think _ is that if Tsai couldn't run it, why should we believe
Weill can,'' Pearce-Batten said. ``I think there are a lot of
reasons, but that's some of the conventional wisdom.
   ``And the management has an unusually strong incentive to get the
stock price up because they have a stock option package. With the
stock going down, their potential wealth is materially affected and
while that's distressing, it's nice to know they're in the same
boat.''
   Weill says the merger is probably his biggest challenge ever.
   ``I wouldn't say it scares me as much as when I was beginning,''
he mused. ``If I made a mistake then, it would have been the end of
the career.''

   Prime Computer Inc. has filed a counterclaim in
U.S. District Court seeking a ``fair disclosure'' of two companies'
$20-a-share tender offer for the computer company's stock.
   MAI Basic Four Inc. and Choice Corp. announced their offer last
Tuesday for Prime, based in Natick, Mass.
   In the counterclaim filed Tuesday, Prime alleges that MAI and
Choice have ties to investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
that some principal owners of MAI were investigated by the Security
and Exchange Commission for allegedly overstating a former company's
income.
   Prime issued a statement urging its shareholders to reserve
action until the company's board of directors announces its
recommendation on the offer. The recommendation is to come no later
than Nov. 29, the statement said.
   Earlier this fall, Prime announced a so-called ``poison pill''
defense against takeovers. The defense gives each shareholder the
right to purchase an additional share of common stock in the event
of a hostile takeover.
   MAI has filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to
block Prime's shareholder rights plan.
   Prime said Tuesday it would delay the issuance of certificates
for additional common stock purchase rights until Dec. 13.

   OPEC announced today it has postponed
until Thursday its anxiously awaited meeting while ministers
continue secretive negotiations aimed at reaching a new production
accord.
   Petroleum prices, which had fluctuated wildly in the previous
session on conflicting reports about the progress of the talks,
turned in another erratic performance before settling slightly
higher. U.S. markets closed early for the Thanksgiving Day holiday
and were not scheduled to reopen until Monday.
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said the
cartel ``is working towards'' an agreement in small bilateral and
multilateral sessions.
   He also indicated that a dispute between Iran and Iraq, one of
the main stumbling blocks to an agreement, had yet to be resolved.
   On Tuesday, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rocketed up $1.42 a barrel from the previous
day's close Tuesday after Iran's oil minister sounded an optimistic
note about prospects for a new agreement at OPEC's ongoing winter
conference. Talks resume today.
   But after hitting a high of $14.40 a barrel for the near-month
contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price tumbled once
the minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, left a meeting with other OPEC
officials empty-handed.
   ``There has been no progress,'' said a senior member of an OPEC
delegation, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   After falling more than $1 off the day's high, West Texas
Intermediate rebounded to finish at $13.86 a barrel, up 88 cents
from Monday's close.
   In early trading today, prices were up more than 40 cents, with
the near-term contract trading at $14.32 a barrel, up 46 cents.
   Earlier, OPEC oil ministers had said they would delay for several
hours today's formal talks in an apparent effort to give them more
time to try to work out a new production accord.
   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told reporters the formal
session of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would
resume in early evening Vienna time. The meeting had been
tentatively scheduled for an earlier start.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is attempting
to curtail its overproduction and lift weak crude prices. The talks
have been stalled by a dispute between Iran and Iraq over how much
oil each will be allowed to produce under any new pact.
   Iraq has insisted on having the same, higher quota as Iran, but
Iran has refused.
   Aghazadeh repeated his opposition to such a deal Tuesday after a
nearly hour-long meeting with ministers from Venezuela, Nigeria,
Algeria and Indonesia, and said he would ``never concede to parity.''
   Aghazadeh said no single proposal was on the table, but he
intended to remain at the talks.
   Oil futures had soared around midday after Aghazadeh, in response
to reporters' questions, said, ``I think we can reach an agreement.''
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister,
said ``We will not end without an agreement.''
   Aghazadeh wants Iran's share of total OPEC output maintained at
the current level of 13.5 percent, the second-largest after Saudi
Arabia's 25.6 percent, and said that demand was firm.
   Iraq's share in the current production accord, worked out in
1986, is third largest at 11.7 percent.
   The new production agreement would set a ceiling on 1989
production.
   The current accord caps OPEC's total output at about 15 million
barrels a day. A senior member of one delegation, who demanded
anonymity, said a consensus appeared to be building for a new
ceiling of about 18.5 million barrels a day.
   Analysts estimate OPEC production soared to about 21 million
barrels in October, reflecting the production that has caused a
worldwide glut and depressed prices.
   Most countries, analysts say, have been exceeding their quotas in
recent months.
   Under the current accord, Iran has a quota of 2.4 million barrels
a day. Iraq was given a ceiling of 1.5 million, which it has refused
to accept.
   OPEC members are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates,
Venezuela, Ecuador, Kuwait, Libya, Gabon, Indonesia, Algeria,
Nigeria and Qatar.

   Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks by the
Big Three automakers rose 2.5 percent in mid-November compared with
the same time last year, makers reported Wednesday.
   The automakers said they sold 245,097 domestically made vehicles
during the Nov. 11-20 period this year compared with 268,843
vehicles during the same period last year.
   The comparison is made on the basis of vehicles sold per selling
day. There were eight sales days during the period this year and
nine last year.
   For the year, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. have sold 7.2 percent more cars and light trucks in 1988 than
in 1987. The companies said they sold 9,834,544 vehicles during the
Jan. 1-Nov. 20 period this year compared with 9,174,729 cars and
light trucks sold during the same time last year.
   Truck sales by the Big Three in mid-November showed a 3.2 percent
gain in 1988 over 1987, and car sales rose 2.1 percent during the
period this year compared with last year.
   After a lull during October last year, automakers began returning
incentives to car deals in November, helping push up the year-ago
sales figures.
   Chrysler and Ford showed declines in mid-November car sales while
GM was the only of the Big Three to show an increase in car sales
during the period.
   The largest drop in mid-November car sales came at Chrysler. The
No. 3 automaker sold 22,933 cars during the period this year, down
2.6 percent from the 26,484 cars it sold during the same time last
year.
   Ford's mid-November car sales fell 1.9 percent, going to 47,450
for the period this year compared with 54,442 last year.
   GM reported a 6.4 percent rise in car sales _ to 76,291 during
mid-November this year from 80,628 cars sold during the same period
last year.

<HEAD>Crop Markets Rise on Talk of Soviet Grain Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade on reports that
announcement of a new long-term U.S.-Soviet grain deal was imminent.
   One financial news service reported that U.S. officials would fly
to Moscow to sign a 2-year pact on Monday. The agreement was rumored
in the grain markets to be an extension of the 5-year contract that
expired on Sept. 30, guaranteeing Soviet purchases of 9 million
metric tons of U.S. grain each year.
   A new agreement has been widely expected but speculation about
the timing of the announcement has increased the volatility of the
grain markets in the past six weeks, analysts said.
   But with most forward-looking market players already fairly well
convinced that an agreement was at hand, Wednesday's price movement
tended to reflect disappointment over the lack of other large-scale
grain sales on the horizon.
   As for the timing of an announcement about a Soviet grain deal,
``It makes no difference if it's Friday, Monday, Wednesday _ it's
just around the corner,'' said Katharina Zimmer, grain market
analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 2{ cents lower to 4} cents
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.17} a
bushel; corn was } cent lower to { cent higher with December at
$2.63\ a bushel; oats were } cent to 2} cents higher with December

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 460 money market mutual
funds rose $1.07 billion in the latest week to a record $280.40
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Wednesday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
revised $4.64 billion increase in the funds' assets the previous
week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The previous high for the funds' assets was $280.02 billion in
the week ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 229 general purpose funds rose $660.5 million to $89.90
billion, assets of 100 broker-dealer funds increased $906.9 million
to $118.23 billion, and assets of 131 institutional funds fell
$501.5 million to $72.28 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.68 percent from 7.60 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.60 percent from 7.57 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 37
days, unchanged from a week earlier, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.10 percent as of Wednesday from 6.08 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, stood at 5.12 percent, unchanged for the third week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.93
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.88 the
previous week. Yields were 8.21 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.17
percent; 8.39 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.35 percent; and 8.60
percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.55 percent.

   The company said all the affected cars have front-wheel-drive and
2.2-liter, turbocharged engines. Chrysler said because of
deterioration and cold weather, the hoses may stiffen and fuel leaks
could occur under the cars' hoods.
   Chrysler, which will fix the problem at no cost to the consumer,

   The dollar closed lower against all key foreign
currencies Wednesday in thin pre-holiday trading.
   Gold prices were mostly higher. Republic National Bank quoted
bullion at $419 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up $1 from late
Tuesday.
   Currency dealers said reports of dollar-buying by the Federal
Reserve on Wednesday and fears of further central-bank intervention
prevented the currency from falling even further.
   But they said the markets remained bearish toward the dollar,
with most money traders preoccupied with how President-elect George
Bush will deal with the huge U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.
If left unchecked, traders fear, both gaps could hurt the economy.
   ``Until we hear something specific, we're going to see a further
decline in the dollar,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a trader with Harris
Trust & Co. in Chicago.
   Johnson said Wednesday's session was very quiet as many traders
decided to get a jump on the Thanksgiving Day holiday Thursday.
   The Tokyo markets were closed for a national holiday Wednesday.
But in London, the dollar traded at 121.30 Japanese yen, down from
121.78 yen at Tuesday's Tokyo close. Later, in New York, the dollar
stood at 121.175 yen, down from 121.315 yen Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound, which has gained more than 10 cents
against the dollar in the past six weeks, cost $1.8355 late
Wednesday, more expensive for buyers than Tuesday's $1.8305.
Sterling fetched $1.8360 in New York, up from $1.83375 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.71775 West German marks, down from 1.71855; 1.44155
Swiss francs, down from 1.44575; 1.19875 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2008; 5.87125 French francs, down from 5.8765; and 1,276.375
Italian lire, down from 1,277.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday: 1.7155 West
German marks, down from 1.7230; 1.4415 Swiss francs, down from
1.4545; 5.8685 French francs, down from 5.9090; 1.9365 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9480; 1,276.50 Italian lire, down from
1,285.00; and 1.1982 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2002.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
rose to $420 a troy ounce from $417.70 late Tuesday.
   The late bid price in London was $419.25 a troy ounce, down from
$419.65 Tuesday, and in Zurich, $419.30, up from $418.90.
   Earlier, gold closed in Hong Kong at $419.87 an ounce, up from

   Silver was slightly more expensive. On the New York Comex, silver
bullion rose to $6.083 a troy ounce from $6.061 on Tuesday. It rose

   OPEC oil ministers canceled a formal
session of their winter meeting Wednesday as they grappled behind
the scenes again in an attempt to break a deadlock between Iran and
Iraq over production quotas.
   Petroleum markets remained cautiously optimistic about the
chances for the cartel reaching an agreement to limit its output,
however, as prices rose for a second day although prices again swung
wildly.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
recessed its formal talks after a brief session Monday, opting
instead for small, private meetings. The full plenary session was
rescheduled for Thursday.
   ``We're working towards (an agreement),'' said OPEC President
Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister.
   He said the ministers were still trying to resolve the dispute
between Iran and Iraq that has stalled an overall agreement. Iraq,
which fought Iran in an 8-year war that ended in August, has been
seeking a production quota equal to Iran's, but its former foe has
adamantly opposed parity.
   Lukman met for lunch with Oil Ministers Hisham Nazer of Saudi
Arabia, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi of Iraq and Ginandjar
Kartasasmita of Indonesia.
   Afterward, al-Chalabi quipped, ``We're always near an agreement,
but how near I cannot tell.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, ended the day at $13.97 a barrel, up
11 cents after trading as much as 74 cents above Tuesday's close.
The price had soared more than $1.40 on Tuesday before finishing up
88 cents.
   Oil brokers said trading was relatively light Wednesday in
advance of a four-day Thanksgiving Day holiday.
   The oil ministers are trying to fashion a new production
agreement that would reduce the world oil glut and help raise crude
prices.
   ``There is an arrangement in (the) works but I don't know when
the work is going to be completed,'' said Mana Saeed Otaiba,
petroleum minister for the United Arab Emirates during a stroll in
the chilly Vienna weather.
   ``I think we have to finish before the end of the week. There's
no reason to stay longer,'' he said.
   In addition to settling the dispute between Iran and Iraq, the
ministers also are trying to decide how much oil the cartel as a
whole should produce to keep prices at a profitable level.
   Although several OPEC members have stepped up their production,
oil revenue has declined because of the slump in prices, which have
been running about 25 percent below OPEC's goal of $18 a barrel.
   Julien M'Pouho Epigat, Gabon's minister of hydrocarbons, said
OPEC members were focusing on two possible ceilings for total output
_ 18.5 million barrels a day and 19 million barrels.
   M'Pouho Epigat said an accord that held production to 18.5
million barrels would result in prices ranging between $15 and $18 a
barrel.
   Otaiba also said that a cap of 18.5 million barrels a day for
total production ``is what they are talking about.''
   But, Lukman, when asked about such a ceiling, said, ``Sounds
good, but (it's) not necessarily the right one (number).''
   The new production accord would replace a 2-year-old agreement
that set a ceiling of 15 million a barrels a day for 12 of OPEC's
members. Iraq was not included because it refused to abide by a
quota that was less than Iran's.
   Despite that agreement, OPEC's members are estimated to be
producing more than 20 million barrels a day.
   Iraq argues it needs a quota as big as Iran's because it needs
revenue to rebuild an economy shattered by their long war.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh has repeatedy told
reporters he would never agree to parity with Iraq.
   Aghazadeh offered to allow Iraq ``export parity,'' which would
give the two countries the same total for overseas sales. He said
the more populous Iran should retain a bigger overall quota because
of its higher internal demand for oil.
   Aghazadeh said Iran's share of total OPEC output be maintained at
the current level of 13.5 percent, second after Saudi Arabia's 25.6
percent. Iraq's share is third at 11.7 percent.

   Financier Bennett LeBow intensified efforts
Wednesday to buy Prime Computer Inc., releasing a letter aimed at
assuring its management he has no hidden agenda in the $970 million
hostile takeover attempt by his much smaller computer business, MAI
Basic Four Inc.
   ``Contrary to speculation from certain quarters about MAI Basic
Four's intentions, the only motive for MAI Basic Four's tender offer
for Prime shares is to acquire Prime,'' LeBow wrote to Prime
president Anthony Craig.
   ``The combination of MAI Basic Four and Prime ... will produce a
powerful competitor in the rapidly maturing computer industry,''
LeBow wrote.
   ``We firmly believe the combined companies will be far more
successful than either of us can be alone, and a prompt consummation
of our acquisition will best serve the interests of our respective
stockholders, employees, customers and suppliers,'' he wrote.
   Natick-based Prime is second to International Business Machines
Corp. in the field of computer-aided design and manufacturing
systems. In February it acquired Computervision Inc. for $435
million.
   MAI Basic, a small concern based in Tustin, Calif., owns 4.1
percent of Prime's 48.5 million shares outstanding and is offering
$20 a share for the rest in a tender offer to shareholders. The
offer, valued at $970 million, was made Nov. 15.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Prime closed unchanged
Wednesday at $16 a share. MAI Basic fell 62{ cents a share to $8.25.
   There has been some speculation that LeBow undertook the takeover
attempt to induce Prime to buy his company instead, in what is
commonly called a Pac Man defense of acquiring the suitor.
   Prime officials had no comment on the letter, said spokesman
Richard Eckels. However, their intent to resist LeBow was
demonstrated forcefully Tuesday when the company sued MAI Basic on
grounds that its takeover offer was illegal and flawed.
   The suit filed in U.S. District Court alleged improprieties in
the tender offer, including failure to disclose the uncertain nature
of its financing and that some owners of MAI Basic have been
investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly
overstating the firm's income.
   The suit also alleges full disclosure was not made of the role in
the tender offer played by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has
been sued by the SEC on urelated securities fraud charges.
   MAI Basic said in response that the suit is groundless and the
company was ``disappointed that Prime has resorted to this legal
smokescreen apparently before the Prime board has made a decision
about the merits of our offer.''
   Prime has asked shareholders to wait until the company's board of
directors announces its recommendation on the offer, which is
expected by Nov. 29.
   Prime also announced Tuesday it has delayed until at least Dec.
13 the activation of its shareholder rights ``poison-pill'' defense,
which is designed to make an unwelcome takeover prohibitively
expensive.
   MAI Basic has filed suit in Chancery Court in Delaware, where
Prime is incorporated, seeking to block the defense.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. urged owners of
its 27 million shares Wednesday against siding with dissidents bent
on dismantling the last major U.S. television manufacturer.
   In a letter, Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman acknowledged that
the Chicago-area company ``has had some rough times in the past
several years, rough for all of us shareholders and also for our
employees.''
   But Pearlman said the mutinous investor group Brookhurst Partners
``has no experience whatsoever in our business.
   ``To suppose that they could come in and consummate a transaction
in the best interests of shareholders more quickly than Zenith's
experienced management and board ... is, in our opinion, absurd,''
Pearlman said in the letter.
   Zenith shareholders have until Dec. 4 to return signed consent
forms to Brookhurst Partners, indicating their support for
Brookhurst's plan. The limited partnership, led by New York
stock-market speculators Herbert B. Abelow and Nicholas L. Ihasz,
has proposed to reduce the size of Zenith's board of directors to
six from 10 _ dumping Pearlman in the process _ and to have three of
its own people named to the board.
   The Brookhurst bloc would be committed to selling Zenith's
foundering consumer electronics division or, failing that, to
selling the entire company, which also manufactures highly regarded
personal computers.
   Brookhurst has said its proposals would become effective if they
receive the backing of a majority of Zenith shareholders.
   On Wednesday, Brookhurst would have no response to Zenith's
letter, said spokesman William Jenks in New York.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Zenith rose 62{ cents
a share to $17.62{ on Wednesday.
   Brookhurst, Zenith's largest shareholder, has accumulated 6.1
percent of Zenith's stock since the partnership was formed in the
spring.
   Zenith has contended in a pending lawsuit in U.S. District Court
in Chicago that Abelow and Ihasz are interested only in boosting the
value of Zenith's stock so they can sell their shares at a profit.
   Thus, Zenith claims that Brookhurst is defrauding other
shareholders with its consent solicitation.
   Zenith also contends that Brookhurst's public statements and
letters to shareholders have contained specific misstatements of
facts.
   Brookhurst has denied any wrongdoing.
   Zenith has posted multimillion-dollar losses for each of the past
three years. But the company reported a $3 million profit for the
third quarter of 1988 in contrast to a loss of $25.1 million a year
earlier, and has said it expects to show a pre-tax profit for the
year for the first time since 1984.
   The struggle for Zenith is being watched closely by Washington,
Silicon Valley and foreign capitals because of what it could mean
for the future of the United States in high technology.
   Zenith is only the world's 13th largest color TV maker, but some
analysts are asking that if Zenith cannot make it in televisions,
what American company can.

   Owners of Pontiac Fieros, two-seater cars that
aren't being made anymore, can get a $500 credit toward the purchase
of a new Pontiac, the General Motors Corp. division said Wednesday.
   GM spokesman William J. O'Neill said the company's Pontiac
Division was mailing special coupons to 150,000 Fiero owners
offering them the cash if they buy any model 1989 Pontiac.
   The offer expires Sept. 30, 1989, the end of the 1989 model year,
and is available in addition to any other incentive the company has
offered.
   Fiero production stopped in August of this year after sales had
slumped badly. The plastic-body car was introduced in late 1983.

   The stock market staged a moderate advance
Wednesday in quiet pre-Thanksgiving Day trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 14.58 to 2,092.28
for its best single-day showing in nearly three weeks.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
893 up, 514 down and 519 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 112.01 million
shares, against 127 million in the previous session and the smallest
total since a 108.72 million-share day on Aug. 30.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 134.95 million shares.
   Analysts said the market benefited from ``bargain hunting'' by
traders after the sharp decline in stock prices earlier in the month.
   But they also expressed concern that buy orders in the past few
days have been concentrated in a few big-name issues, while the
broad market has been flat at best.
   In the economic news, the Commerce Department reported that new
factory orders for durable goods increased 2.4 percent in October.
The gain was concentrated in defense orders, which are traditionally
volatile, and had little visible effect on stocks.
   Airline stocks were a notable hot spot, benefiting in part from
the recent trend toward higher fares. UAL jumped 5\ to 105{; AMR 2]
to 50\; Delta Air Lines } to 47~, and NWA 1] to 55[.
   Energy issues were mixed as traders monitored efforts of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reach agreement on
a production-quota plan aimed at bolstering world oil prices. Amoco
rose \ to 71|; Mobil was unchanged at 42|, and Atlantic-Richfield
slipped [ to 78.
   Interco gained 3 to 67}. The company, which is fighting a
takeover bid by an investor group, increased the special dividends
it would pay as part of a restructuring.
   Among other current takeover targets, RJR Nabisco rose 1| to 86~
and Pillsbury was up 1[ at 57.
   General Motors, which said a dividend increase was possible if
earnings maintain their recent pace, added ~ to 82\.
   Other gainers among the blue-chip industrials included American
Telephone & Telegraph, up } at 29\; General Electric, up ] at 44];
International Business Machines, up 1 at 118, and Sears Roebuck, up
[ at 40.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $15.64 billion, or 0.59
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.86 to 151.41.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.90 to 309.45, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.79 at 269.00.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
advanced 2.40 to 367.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 290.09, up 1.87.

   U.S. car and light truck sales were up 3.5 percent
in mid-November compared with the same period last year, but the
figures announced Wednesday were lower than expected.
   The seven automakers said they sold 259,725 vehicles during the
Nov. 11-20 period this year, compared with 282,177 during the same
time last year.
   The comparison is based on the daily average of vehicles sold in
the period, which included eight selling days, one less than last
year.
   Car sales rose 3.7 percent this year over mid-November last year,
and truck sales were up 3.3 percent.
   Despite the gains, analyst Donald DeScenza of Nomura Securities
Inc. of New York was pessimistic about the industry's performance.
   This year, he said, there was no ``end-of-model-year blowout
incentive programs'' like last year when buyers planning to purchase
a new car in October or November moved up their plans and hit the
showrooms in September.
   ``You'd have a tremendous burst in sales in August and September
and a counterbalancing weakness in October and November,'' he said.
   But that didn't happen in 1988, and sales figures for October and
November of this year should be much higher than figures from the
same time last year.
   ``The fact is that they weren't up much at all, and you'd have
expected them to be,'' he said. ``The fact that it isn't way ahead
of (last year's pace) is surprising.''
   Among the Big Three car makers, General Motors Corp. showed the
only gain in mid-November this year, compared with the same time
last year _ rising 6.4 percent on a daily rate. During the period
this year, GM sold 76,291 cars compared with the 80,628 cars it sold
during the period last year.
   Ford Motor Co.'s car sales fell 1.9 percent to 47,450 in
mid-November this year compared with 54,442 last year. Chrysler
Corp.'s car sales fell 2.6 percent to 22,933 this year from 26,484
last year.
   So far this calendar year, though, all the Big Three showed sales
gains, with Chrysler leading the way, followed by Ford and GM.
   Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 automaker, sold 953,390 cars between
Jan. 1 and Nov. 20 of this year, up 11.3 percent from the 856,442 it
sold during the same time last year.
   Ford showed a more modest increase, going up 9.2 percent to
1,970,528 cars this year from 1,805,212 last year.
   GM's year-to-date car sale figures showed a slight 0.9 percent
increase, going to 3,243,423 this year from 3,214,423 last year.

<HEAD>Peru Government Doubles Food Prices, Boosts Wages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has doubled food prices and
devalued Peru's currency 50 percent in a further effort to combat
rampant inflation and boost exports.
   The program, announced late Tuesday by Finance Minister Abel
Salinas, was the fourth emergency economic package this year aimed
at pulling Peru from a sharp recession.
   It included wage increases of about 50 percent for most Peruvian
workers.
   A similar package of sweeping austerity measures announced in
September failed to slow inflation. It did spark widespread street
protests and some sporadic looting.
   Economists and opposition politicians labeled the new package
contradictory and said it would not end a severe food shortage or
the wave of strikes stemming from the recession.
   For a month housewives and others have been forced to wait for
hours in lines of several blocks to buy daily rations of such basic
food stuffs as bread, sugar and rice.
   Salinas said the program continues government efforts to phase
out subsidies of food and consumer and industrial goods and thus
reduce the nation's burgeoning deficit, considered the major cause
of inflation.
   Consumer prices have soared 932.5 percent since January and are
expected to surpass 1,200 percent for the year. The previous highest
annual inflation rate was 158.3 percent in 1985.
   Salinas said a currency devaluation of 50 percent, dropping the
value of the Peruvian inti from 250 to 500 intis to the U.S. dollar,
would restrict imports and serve as an incentive to manufacturers to
boost exports.
   Independent analyst Alejandro Toledo said the center-left
government of Alan Garcia ``must now pay the bill'' after financing
two previous years of growth with government subsidies.
   On taking office in July 1985, Garcia limited payments on the
nation's foreign debt and used money owed international banks to
finance an economic recovery program.
   The economy grew 8.5 percent in 1986 and 7 percent in 1987. But
the government's dollar reserves ran out a year ago and the economy
fell into a recession this year.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices drifted in a narrow range and
finished mixed Wednesday in quiet pre-holiday trading.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue edged up 1-16 point, or
less than $1 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield slipped to
9.10 percent from 9.11 percent late Tuesday.
   Analysts said bond prices weakened early in the day as oil prices
advanced, suggesting that value-eroding inflation could accelerate.
   But they said bonds recovered some lost ground later as oil
prices fell off their highs amid indications that OPEC may have a
tough time coming to an agreement on production limits.
   Elliott Platt, research director for Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp., said the market appeared to shrug off the
government's report that durable goods orders rose 2.4 percent in
October.
   He said even though the increase was bigger than expected, it
reflected a sizeable rise in defense orders which many economists do
not view as an indication of underlying economic strength.
   Platt said the pace of trading trailed off sharply in the
afternoon as many traders got a head start on Thursday's observance
of Thanksgiving.
   Meantime, the Treasury sold $7.5 billion in five-year, two-month
notes at an average yield of 8.97 percent, down from 9.04 percent at
the Aug. 24 auction and the lowest since five-year notes averaged
8.77 percent on May 26.
   In the secondary market, prices of short-term government issues
were unchanged, intermediate maturities fell 3-32 point and 20-year
issues rose [ point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc.,
a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, fell 0.42 to 1,134.52.
   In corporate trading, industrials gained ground. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.07 to 293.74.
   In tax-exempt trading, prices declined 1-32 point, according to
the Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.25 percent with
the discount down 3 basis points at 7.98 percent. The yield on
six-month bills was unchanged at 8.52 percent as the discount held
at 8.07 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.68 percent as
the discount fell 1 basis point to 8.05 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 5-16 percent, down from 8]
percent late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Copper Prices Rocket On Renewed Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewed fears of tight supplies ignited an explosion in copper
futures prices Wednesday on New York's Commodity Exchange as hedgers
and speculators bought heavily ahead of the Thanksgiving weekend,
driving prices to record highs.
   On other markets, rumors of a U.S.-Soviet grain-sales agreement
supported grain and soybean futures while prices of sugar, crude
oil, precious metals, livestock, meat and stock-index futures all
advanced.
   Wednesday's 8 percent rise in the price of copper for December
delivery, along with Tuesday's 6 percent gain, appeared to end a
three-week period of consolidation and seemed to signal that the
restless market was again on the upswing, analysts said.
   Copper settled 4 cents to 11.8 cents higher on the Commodity
Exchange with December at $1.546 a pound and the spot November
contract at $1.60 a pound, an all-time high for Comex copper.
   Copper's long-term bullish factors include dwindling on-hand
supplies, expanding consumption and declining production in several
key countries including Peru, where a miners' strike is in its sixth
week.
   But fresh developments had been scarce until Wednesday, when the
Comex reported a 24 percent decline during the past week in its
warehouse stocks of copper to a record-low 5,957 short tons.
   The decline of nearly 1,900 tons shocked traders who had become
accustomed to weekly offtake figures between 500 and 1,000 tons,
said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   ``Suddenly now you're seeing a sharp decline to under 6,000 tons
and that spells lack of availability,'' she said.
   Analysts said the market expected both the Comex and the London
Metal Exchange to report further drops in warehouse stocks next week.
   Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
New York, said copper production in Peru, the world's sixth-largest
producer, was down 17 percent through the first three quarters of
this year while production in both Zambia and Zaire was down 20
percent and Chilean shipments declined 7 percent.
   ``So these production problems are persisting and likely to
disrupt output over the next two quarters,'' he said.
   Prices of most grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid reports that announcement of a new long-term
U.S.-Soviet grain deal was imminent.
   But with most forward-looking market players already fairly well
convinced that an agreement was at hand, Wednesday's price movement
was dampened by disappointment over the lack of other large-scale
grain sales on the horizon.
   As for the timing of an announcement about a Soviet grain deal,
``It makes no difference if it's Friday, Monday, Wednesday _ it's
just around the corner,'' said Katharina Zimmer, grain market
analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to 5 cents higher with December at
$4.18 a bushel; corn was } cent lower to { cent higher with December
at $2.63\ a bushel; oats were 1} cent to 3\ cents higher with
December at $2.12\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 4{ cents
higher with January at $7.55\ a bushel.
   Sugar futures prices rallied to new three-month highs on New
York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange on bullish fundamental and
technical factors, analysts said.
   The active March contract topped the key resistance point of 11
cents a pound in intra-day trading.
   Sugar settled .25 cent to .29 cent higher with the active March
contract at 10.94 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices gyrated with each new development from the
OPEC meeting in Vienna but ended mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 16 cents
higher with January at $13.97 a barrel; heating oil was .28 cent to
.84 cent higher with December at 45.72 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .87 cent lower to .06 cent higher with December at
44.46 cents a gallon.
   Precious-metals futures advanced on the Comex in line with crude
oil.
   Gold settled $1.80 to $2.30 higher with December at $420.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 2 cents to 4.3 cents higher with December at
$6.095 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .35 cent
to .70 cent higher with December at 73.47 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .32 cent to .73 cent higher with January at 82.35 cents
a pound; hogs were .47 cent lower to .47 cent higher with December
at 39.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .33 cent to .63
cent higher with February at 42.80 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled .90 point higher at 269.25.

   Gillette Canada Inc. will phase out manufacturing
operations in Montreal and Toronto as part of its restructuring
program to increase productivity and strengthen its competitive
position, officials said Wednesday.
   The Montreal facility, which produces blades, razors and toiletry
products, and the Toronto plant, which manufactures writing
instruments and corrective fluids, will be phased out over an
18-month period beginning in early 1989.
   ``The decision has a deep impact on all of us,'' said Ronald J.
Rossi, president of the Blade and Razor Division, North America.
``It will directly affect approximately 430 regular and 100
temporary employees in Montreal and 60 employees in Toronto.''
   Rossi's remarks were included in a statement issued by
Boston-based Gillette Co., the parent company.
   Gillette said that since the restructuring program began in
January 1987, the company has phased out or sold operations in the
United States, Argentina, Brazil, Britain and other countries.
   The company said Gillette Canada will remain a fully independent
operating unit. Sales, marketing, distribution and administrative
functions also will remain in both Montreal and Toronto.

<HEAD>Stock Up After Saying It Will Consider Selling Self As Two
Companies</HEAD>

   Pillsbury Co. stock climbed Wednesday after
the company reportedly indicated for the first time since becoming
the takeover target of Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC that it may
sell itself and its Burger King Corp. unit as separate companies.
   The possible defense tactic was included in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing, The Wall Street Journal reported
Wednesday.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pillsbury stock rose
$1.12{ a share to $57.
   ``If Burger King and the company were sold as separate entities
in the future (although no decision has been made to sell Burger
King or the company in the future) there would be additional
potential buyers and substantially greater values could be realized
for stockholders,'' the SEC filing said.
   But the filing also said Pillsbury directors believe now isn't
the right time to sell, partly because Smith only took over in
August and partly because ``greater values could be realized in the
future as a result of the restructuring efforts presently under
way.''
   Pillsbury is resisting the $5.23 billion hostile takeover bid
from Grand Met, a British distilling, gambling and specialty
products conglomerate.
   On Monday, Pillsbury announced it was delaying the planned
spinoff of its Burger King subsidiary by 2{ weeks.
   Pillsbury's board of directors pushed the date of the spinoff
back to Dec. 19 from Dec. 2, at the request of the Delaware court
that is hearing Grand Met's challenge of the plan, Smith said Monday.
   The proposed spinoff, which would make Burger King a separate,
publicly traded concern held by current Pillsbury shareholders, is a
key element in the company's attempts to thwart Grand Met's bid.
   A hearing on the Grand Met challenge is scheduled for Monday
before Chancellor William Allen in Delaware Chancery Court.
   Grand Met is seeking court orders to overturn the spinoff as well
as an anti-takeover provision in Pillsbury's bylaws. Grand Met also
has said it might have to lower its $60 a share offer if the spinoff
occurred because the new Burger King would present a huge tax
liability.
   Grand Met said Monday more than 72 million shares of Pillsbury
common stock, representing about 84.6 percent of outstanding shares,
have been tendered and not withdrawn.
   Pillsbury's board of directors has rejected Grand Met's offer as
inadequate, and urged shareholders not to tender their stock.
   At a weekend meeting, the Pillsbury board affirmed Smith's
decision to decline a personal meeting with Grand Met Chairman Allen
Sheppard, Pillsbury said Monday. Sheppard renewed the plea in a
letter to Pillsbury on Tuesday, but Pillsbury did not comment on its
strategy.

<TEXT>
   Fresh from victory in California, consumer
activist Ralph Nader brought his campaign to overhaul the insurance
industry to the nation's insurance capital Wednesday, calling the
industry ``fat, lazy, wasteful, and inefficient.''
   Appearing with Nader at a news conference was Harvey Rosenfield,
the 36-year-old author of California Proposition 103.
   The ground-breaking initiative passed earlier this month rolls
back auto and property casualty premium rates, repeals the
industry's exemption from state antitrust laws and imposes numerous
other changes opposed by the insurance industry.
   ``We're here to make sure the Connecticut insurance companies
hear the message of the California voters,'' Nader told reporters.
   In anticipation of Nader's remarks, Connecticut's insurance
companies responded in a united voice, calling Nader's suggested
solution to high insurance rates a ``prescription for chaos and
disaster.''
   ``Cutting insurance rates without cutting the costs responsible
for these rates is a transparent attempt to prescribe snake oil
remedies for hard realities,'' said John H. Blair, president of the
Insurance Association of Connecticut.
   Nader said insurance companies have ``underestimated the level of
outrage'' felt by ratepayers over rapidly increasing premiums. In
Connecticut, he said, auto insurance premiums on passenger cars rose
46.6 percent from 1984 to 1988.
   He blamed the increase on a lack of competition, state laws that
exempt insurance companies from anti-trust laws, and inefficiencies
such as bloated middle management staffs and high executive salaries.
   ``It's like Ford Motor Co. was in 1979: fat, lazy, wasteful, and
inefficient,'' he said.
   Nader said that through consumer pressure, insurance companies
can be made more efficient, more accountable, and more concerned
with what he described as their original mission, loss prevention
through greater emphasis on safety. As a result, he said, their
rates will drop.
   Nader saved his strongest criticism for Hartford-based Aetna Life
& Casualty Co., which he said is ``more aggressive and more cruel
than any other insurance company.''
   He pointed to the company's ad campaign against ``lawsuit abuse''
in which the company uses the slogan, ``Enough is enough.''
   He described the ads, appearing now in newspapers in Denver, New
Orleans, St. Louis and Rochester, N.Y., as ``collective jury
tampering'' in an effort to reduce the amount jurors would award in
lawsuits.
   Plaintiffs' lawyers and district attorneys in Colorado have made
similar charges recently, claiming the ads are misleading and
possibly in violation of state laws against deceptive trade
practices.
   Jason Wright, a spokesman for Aetna, said the company will not be
intimidated into dropping the ads, which he der trial system: that
peo discuss ``the dirty little secret of our trial system: that
people can sue at the drop of a hat over basically anything.''
   Wright also dismissed Nader's call for consumer revolt in
Connecticut, saying auto insurance premium rates have not increased
as dramatically in Connecticut as they have in California.
   Wright predicted that insurance companies will succeed in their
efforts to challenge Proposition 103 in court.
   He said Aetna's auto insurance divisin in California has lost $12
million in the past four years because of skyrocketing ``loss
costs,'' including $5 million last year.
   Prop. 103 rolls back California auto premium rates to 20 percent
below their November 1987 levels. Among other changes, it also ends
the system in which rates are set according to where drivers live
rather than their driving record.
   ``If you can tell me how you can cut prices by 20 percent there,
I'd be amazed,'' Wright said. ``It doesn't make sense.''

   Manville Corp. announced Wednesday it had reached
agreement with the Colorado Insurance Guaranty Association settling
certain Manville claims for asbestos insurance coverage provided by
two insurers who have gone out of business.
   CIGA is organized under state law to pay certain claims on behalf
of Colorado companies under policies written by insurers which have
become insolvent.
   Under the out-of-court settlement, CIGA will make a $15 million
lump sum payment to cover Manville's claims against CIGA for
policies issued by Midland Insurance Co. and Transit Casualty Co.
prior to July 1983.
   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court earlier enjoined CIGA from seeking a
Denver District Court ruling on its obligations to Manville. The
Denver-based building products giant then brought suit on the issue
in bankruptcy court. The settlement will resolve both lawsuits if
the bankruptcy court gives approval.
   The settlement would benefit Manville's Asbestos Property Damage
Trust established by the company's reorganziation plan under Chapter
11 in the bankruptcy court.
   Previous insurance settlements with various insurance carriers
provide for payments totalling around $850 million. Manville's plan
for reorganization requires funding of $615 million in present value
to fund the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust for asbestos
health claimants.
   Manville filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on Aug.
26, 1982 as a mounting wave of asbestos-related damage suits showed
no signs of abating. By 1986, property damage claims totaled $85
billion.
   Manville's reorganization plan has been approved by the
bankruptcy court. The company will consummate that plan next Monday.

   Lone Star Industries Inc. announced
Wednesday that a U.S. branch of Tarmac PLC will acquire the
remaining 40 percent interest in the Lone Star-Tarmac joint venture
in cement, aggregates, concrete and concrete products for $188
million in preferred stock.
   In 1986, Lone Star sold a 60 percent in those businesses in
Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina to Tarmac.
   Lone Star said it expected to close the transaction in December
after completing regulatory requirements. The transaction has been
structured as a tax-free reorganization so that Lone Star's
resulting gain will be deferred until redemption of the preferred
shares, the company said.
   Greenwich-based Lone Star is a leading producer and importer of
cement and a major source of ready-mixed concrete, sand, gravel,
crushed stone, precast concrete products and other construction
materials.
   Tarmac is a British building materials company based in London.

<HEAD>Auto Sales Up, Durable Goods Mixed, Oil Up, Dollar Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial markets downshifted into the Thanksgiving weekend with
mixed results, influenced by weakness in auto sales, sluggish orders
for other big U.S.-made products and the uncertain outcome of an
OPEC meeting.
   Domestic automakers said Wednesday they sold 3.5 percent more
cars and light trucks during mid-November than they did during the
same period last year, when sales were unusually depressed.
   ``The fact is that they weren't up much at all, and you'd have
expected them to be,'' said Donald DeScenza, who follows the auto
industry for Nomura Securities Inc. of New York.
   Another suggestion of economic weakness came from Washington,
where the government said orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
slipped in October for the second straight month, after discounting
orders for military equipment.
   The Commerce Department said total orders, including the biggest
gain in military goods since June, rose 2.4 percent to a seasonally
adjusted $122.1 billion. Excluding the defense category, which
swings widely from month to month, orders fell 0.2 percent in
October and 2.5 percent in September.
   Additional economic uncertainty arose overseas in Vienna,
Austria, where ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries have been trying to reach a compromise for limiting output
and raising world prices.
   Speculation they could agree on a formula boosted prices for the
second straight day on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where oil
contracts closed up 11 cents at $13.97 a barrel.
   None of this news helped the dollar, which has been under severe
pressure since the election of George Bush to succeed Ronald Reagan
as president. There is widespread concern that Bush will do little
to ease the large U.S. budget and trade deficits that many
economists see as long-term threats.
   The dollar fell against all key currencies. Traders said the only
obstacles to further weakening were thin pre-holiday dealings and
the worry that central banks would intervene to halt the dollar's
slide.
   On Wall Street, bond prices were mixed, but stocks had a better
day. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.58 points to 2,092.28
and advancing issues outnumbered declines by about a 7-to-4 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, although trading was the lightest in
nearly three months.

   Petroleum markets remained cautiously optimistic
in the face of continued uncertainty over whether OPEC will reach an
agreement to curtail oil production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday, the January
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude, closed at $13.97 a barrel, up 11 cents from Tuesday's
settlement price. The contract had traded as much as 74 cents
higher. Other contract months also rose.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries apparently
remained deadlocked Wednesday in its efforts to reach a new
agreement on reducing the cartel's output and boost world crude
prices.
   The ministers from the 13-nation cartel meeting in Vienna,
Austria, postponed until Thursday a planned formal meeting scheduled
for Wednesday but continued to meet in small, informal groups.
   Analysts said oil prices opened sharply higher in brisk trading
but then began to backtrack after the announcement that the OPEC
ministers had postponed their plenary session for the second time
since Monday.
   Minutes before the early Thanksgiving eve closing at about 1 p.m.
EST, a wave of frenzied selling drove prices sharply off their
highs, analysts said.
   Nevertheless, the market closed with a ``positive bias,'' said
Mike McDermott, an analyst with Benchmark Futures Inc.
   ``(Investors) think there is going to be an agreement but they're
not sure so they don't want to have an outright position'' going
into the long weekend, he said. The U.S. oil markets will remain
closed until Monday.
   In other futures trading, the prices of refined crude products
finished the day mixed, with unleaded gasoline down sharply and
heating oil up.
   The December contract for unleaded gasoline fell 0.87 cent a
gallon to 44.46 cents after rising more than a penny on Tuesday.
Analysts said the drop was in response to an American Petroleum
Institute report showing gasoline stocks rose 6.5 million barrels
last week.
   Bob Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said
the higher gasoline supply reflected sharply higher imports and
weaker consumer demand.
   ``There had been talk of unseasonably high demand for gasoline,''
Baker said. ``In fact, we have not had that kind of change. Gasoline
consumption trends are moderate and the market is selling off
because of the adjustment.''
   Heating oil for December rose 0.28 cent to 45.72 cents a gallon,
pulled up by the higher crude prices, analysts said.
   Despite the Thanksgiving Day holiday, analysts said some trading
would continue Thursday and Friday through the London International
Petroleum Exchange.
   Analysts said they expect OPEC either to reach some kind of
agreement by Friday or adjourn the meeting.
   ``A couple of ministers have said they will return home by the
end of this week,'' Baker said, ``so most probably the time for a
solution is Friday. They can't see staying around if they don't have
an agreement by then.''
