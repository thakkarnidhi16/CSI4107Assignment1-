   A kitchen stove that was used to heat a house sparked a fire
early Thanksgiving Day in New Jersey that left three boys dead and
two others seriously injured, authorities said.
   In Dunnellon, Fla., a propane heater inside a camper exploded and
burned a family of four, police said.
   And in Lynn, Mass., a woman escorted her six children to the
street before returning to her apartment, locking herself in and
apparently igniting the fire that killed her, fire officials said.
   ``She rounded up her kids, got them all out of the house and then
went back in and set the house on fire,'' said Fire Chief Edward
Higgins of Evelyn Iliopoulus, was released Wednesday from a
psychological counseling center.
   The blaze, which began shortly after 1 p.m., forced the
evacuation of 32 people and two firefighters received minor injuries.
   Firefighters arrived at the East Camden, N.J., residence to find
the rear of the house engulfed in flames, said Fire Inspector Paul
Escher.
   Neighbors rescued a 4-year-old boy from the blaze before
firefighters arrived, authorities said, and city rescue workers
pulled four other young boys from the burning building.
   The 4-year-old was in serious but stable condition at a hospital,
where he was treated for smoke inhalation. An 11-year-old boy pulled
from the fire by rescue workers was being treated for severe burns.
   The other three boys, an 8-year-old and two 9-year-olds, were
pronounced dead from burns and smoke inhalation.
   Escher said the boys were related but not brothers. He said an
adult was in the house and survived the fire.
   In Texas, two 4-year-old boys died in separate fires.
   A heater apparently ignited the mobile home fire in the central
Texas town of Comanche that killed 4-year-old Brian Hatley and
hospitalized his parents and two younger sisters with severe burns,
fire officials said.
   And in the east Texas community of Hemphill, authorities said a
4-year-old boy was killed in a house fire and his brother
hospitalized in the Shrine Burn Center in Galveston. The identities
of the boys were not immediately available.
   The Florida fire left John Roof Sr., 37, with burns over 70
percent of his body, said Shands Hospital spokeswoman Jennifer
Fanzlow.
   Roof and his wife, Julie Roof, 34, were in critical condition.
Their two children were in fair condition, Ms. Fanzlow said.
   ``He was attempting to light it, and it exploded,'' Ms. Fanzlow
said. ``Whether it was a malfunction of the heater or it was his
fault in lighting it, we don't know at this point.''
   The force of the blast blew out the camper's ceiling and one of
the walls. The children, Jamie, 3, and John Jr. 7, were in bunk beds
and escaped with less serious burns.

   ``So far from God, so close to the United
States.''
   That lament by a former Mexican president, Porfirio Diaz, seemed
to sum up the attitude of many Canadians during the recent election
campaign, which featured a national debate of sorts on Canadian
anxieties about the country next door.
   Americans don't often think about the impact their country has
across its northern and southern borders but both the Canadian
elections and the inauguration of a new Mexican president next week
have been calling attention to the advantages and adversities of
geographical intimacy with the United States.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was on the defensive
during much of the campaign, fending off critics who suggested that
the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement would leave Canada as little
more than an appendage of the United States, further robbing his
countrymen of a national identity.
   In the end, though, a plurality of Canadians felt that the
agreement and its promise of economic boom was too good an
opportunity to pass up, and Mulroney and his Progressive
Conservatives were returned to office.
   As for Mexico, some argue that having the United States as a
neighbor is an unmitigated blessing. Proximity enables Mexico to
send at least part of its surplus population to the United States
and more than $13 billion worth of exports in most years.
   But the United States is, of course, the country which seized
half of Mexico's territory a century and a half ago and, as in
Canada, U.S. cultural and economic penetration of Mexico sometimes
creates psychic torment among Mexicans.
   Mexico, says Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, has a
``fear of being swamped culturally or economically. Whether you
consider it real or not, it's there. And it's a political factor.''
   Former Mexican Finance Minister Jesus Silva Herzog, at a news
conference Wednesday, reinforced this thesis when he said he doubted
that Mexico would follow Canada's path and negotiate a trade
agreement with the United States.
   ``We like the English language but only as a second one,'' Silva
said.
   The notion that Mexico likes to assert its independence by
staking out anti-American positions is espoused by former Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger, who once said that Mexico is
institutionally incapable of embracing any foreign policy position
to the right of the United States.
   Thus, Mexico maintains close ties with Cuba and Nicaragua, the
principal hemispheric adversaries of the Reagan administration.
   The objections of many Canadians to the United States go beyond
the fear of creeping assimilation from the south. They look on the
United States as a ar less humane society and that the free trade
agreement could lead to the dismantling of government social
programs and a large dispossessed underclass similar to that in the
United States.
   ``We're not anti-American,'' says Rick Salutin, a Toronto
playwright who campaigned against the trade agreement. ``We just
don't want to be American.'' Salutin obviously does not speak for
the many other Canadians, including some of the country's most
talented offspring, who admire American dynamism and have packed up
and headed south.
   A third U.S. neighbor, Cuba, at times seems to define its own
existence by trying to be everything that the United States isn't.
According to Cuban doctrine, the country was a ``pseudorepublic''
during the years of American ``imperialist domination'' _ 1902-1958
_ and that ``definitive independence'' occurred only with the 1959
revolution.
   ``Be happy that you're down here,'' President Fidel Castro once
told a gathering in Chile. ``You don't know what it's like to live
next to that country.''

<TEXT>
   There will be 11 new senators in the 101st
Congress that convenes Jan. 3, but they soon will find they aren't
all created equal.
   Republicans, who suffered a one-seat loss in this month's
elections and were left at a 55-45 disadvantage, can take slight
consolation as the pecking order of the new freshman class falls
into place when the Senate meets to elect its leadership next week.
   Atop the new seniority list is Republican Slade Gorton, who won
his comeback bid in Washington state. He takes that spot as the only
former senator in the incoming class.
   The top status will be at least a minimal boost for Gorton. It
entitles him to first pick of vacant office suites in the three
Senate office buildings and perhaps a few other perks, like a
coveted ``hideaway'' office in the Capitol.
   In the Senate Republican Conference, the party conclave that
makes committee assignments for GOP members, Gorton's prior service
also will give him a leg up on his freshman colleagues in the class
of '89.
   Last on the seniority list will be Montana Republican Conrad
Burns, the former farm broadcaster and Yellowstone County
Commissioner who ousted incumbent Democrat John Melcher.
   If Burns wants to know what to expect, he should ask North Dakota
Democrat Kent Conrad, who came in dead last in the seniority
sweepstakes two years ago and wound up with an office off a dank
stairwell in the farthest corner of the Hart Senate Office Building.
   Republicans also hold the next three positions on the seniority
list. All are lawmakers who are moving from the House to the Senate:
Trent Lott of Mississippi, Jim Jeffords of Vermont and Connie Mack
of Florida.
   Lott ranks first among the three because he is a 16-year House
veteran who rose to the party's No. 2 leadership position in the
chamber. Jeffords, after 14 years in the House, ranks next; and
Mack, a six-year House member, will be next in line of seniority.
   In the arcane scheme of things senatorial, politicians who have
been governors get less credit than House members. Being governor
isn't legislative experience, after all, and Congress tends to favor
its own.
   ``Things are different over there,'' Lott said recently, grinning
and shaking his head after trying to master the details of the
Senate seniority system.
   Three incoming freshman senators have been governors, all
Democrats: Virginia's Charles Robb, Robert Kerrey of Nebraska and
Richard Bryan of Nevada, who will be ranked in that order. Among
freshmen with the same qualifications, ties are broken by the
population of the state from which a senator is elected.
   Bringing up the rear of the seniority list are three new senators
who have no experience that earns credit in the Senate ranking
scheme. Again, they are ranked by the sizes of their states:
millionaire businessman Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat; Joseph
Lieberman, the Connecticut attorney general who defeated incumbent
Lowell Weicker; and Montana's Burns.
   This neat arrangement could all be fouled up, however, by the
eleventh new member of the Senate: the person appointed to replace
Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., who is leaving the chamber to be vice
president.
   Quayle has announced plans to resign sometime before the new
Congress convenes on Jan. 3, to enable GOP Indiana Gov. Robert Orr
to select a Republican. Otherwise, a new Democratic governor will
take over in Indiana and appoint a Democrat.
   Where that person will rank on the seniority list is a topic of
debate, and may have to be resolved by a vote in the Republican
conference. He or she could rank first, by virtue of being sworn in
earlier than the others; or it could be last, because Quayle doesn't
technically become unable to hold his Senate seat until Jan. 20,
Inauguration Day.
   In earlier times, an outgoing senator could give his successor a
seniority boost by resigning a few days early and letting the
replacement come into office ahead of others in the new group. But
the practice threatened to mushroom out of control, and has been
abandoned by both the GOP Conference and the Democratic Caucus, the
other party assembly that makes committee assignments.
   If it all seems rather complicated, take heart. Even Senate
insiders disagree on how the whole thing works. Said one Democratic
leadership official: ``It's worse than the family tree, folks.''

   Guyana, a major sugar producer, will
import sugar from Mexico for domestic consumption and use its
stockpile to meet European commitments, the government said.
   The state-run Guyana Sugar Corp. said Thursday that extremely low
production this year forced it to purchase 4,000 tons of sugar from
Mexico and scale down its annual sugar harvest target from 210,000
to 170,000 tons.
   Guyana, the English-speaking Caribbean's largest sugar producer,
earns most of its foreign exchange from sugar, rice and bauxite. It
has never had to import sugar before.
   Last week the company said it was unable to meet its U.S. quota
of 10,000 tons and asked Jamaica and Belize to take up the slack
under a 1984 agreement.
   The company said a four-week strike in January, a drought lasting
until May and periodic work stoppages are to blame for the low
production.

   There may be a little less peace on earth for
smokers in Britain this Christmas.
   The National Society of Non-Smokers has rewritten five Christmas
carols to give them a seasonal anti-smoking flavor, and it hopes the
rest of the nation will sing along.
   Thus ``O Little Town of Bethlehem'' has become ``O Little Lungs
of Smoking Men,'' and ``We Three Kings'' has been transformed from a
story of the Magi to a tale of three representatives of the tobacco
industry.
   To the tune of ``God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,'' the society has
written the ominous-sounding lyrics, and ``Away in the Manger'' was
changed to ``Oblivious of Danger.''
   The popular British carol ``The Holly and the Ivy'' became ``The
Cigarette and Cigar.''
   The tobacco industry calls the idea ``cheap, discreditable and
offensely irreligious.''
   ``It's a tatty attempt to involve Christmas in an extremist
pressure group activity,'' said Clive Turner, director of public
affairs for the Tobacco Advisory Council which represents the
industry.
   ``I think a lot of people who've got no interest in tobacco,
non-smokers, even some of the people who don't like us, would regard
this as a pretty cheap and tacky little move,'' Turner said.
   ``I think it's going to offend a lot of people.''
   But Dr. Penny Coyer, spokeswoman for the charity that helps
smokers stub out their fags _ as cigarettes are known in Britain _
calls it ``a light-hearted and topical way'' to talk about the
danger of smoking.
   ``At this time of year those tunes are popular, they're in
everyone's heads, and therefore it's a way of capitalizing on
something ... to put a message across in a light-hearted way,'' she
said.
   ``They're not in any sense intended as a stab at smokers. They're
not intended to be in any sense offensive.''
   To the tune of ``We Three Kings,'' the non-smokers offer the
following tale:
   ``We three reps from industry are
   Bearing fags (cigarettes) we travel afar
   To the afflicted and the addicted
   We bring nicotine and tar.
   Oh! Tar of cancer, tar of death
   Tar that gives you filthy breath
   Keep on smoking, croaking, choking
   It's much worse than drinking meths (spirits).''
   Instead of ``God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,'' the revisionists came
up with:
   ``God rest you merry smoking folk
   Does nothing you dismay?
   With every single cigarette
   You smoke your lives away;
   Yet still you puff the noxious stuff
   Whatever others say
   Does this bring you comfort and joy,
   Comfort and joy?
   Does this bring you comfort and joy.''
   To the tune of ``O Little Town of Bethlehem,'' the non-smokers
wrote:
   ``O little lungs of smoking men
   How ill we see thee lie:
   All through your owner's fretful sleep
   You wheeze and cough and sigh.
   While in your dark interstices
   Well hidden out of sight
   If something grows, though no one knows
   It may soon come to light.''
   Britain remains a nation of heavy smokers, and cartons of
cigarettes still are considered an appropriate Christmas gift. More
than 14 million people, 33 percent of the populace, are smokers.
   The anti-smoking campaigners have no plans for distributing their
revised carol book. They say they have given them to children who
have then taken them to school, and they hope publicity will prompt
Britons to write in for copies.

   Ashdown Forest, where Christopher Robin's father
conjured up Winnie the Pooh, Piglet and Eeyore, was sold to local
authorities for $2.2 million.
   The 6,000 acres of heath and woodland, the largest open space in
southeast England, was put on the market last year by the executors
of the estate of the 10th Earl de la Warr.
   The buyer, East Sussex County Council, pledged Thursday to allow
continued public access to the forest, which was badly damaged in
the October 1987 hurricane.
   The forest was the setting for the children's stories conjured up
by A.A. Milne 60 years ago for his son Christopher Robin's
entertainment.
   Conservationists and Pooh fans successfully fought off an attempt
by British Petroleum last year to drill for oil in the forest.

<DATELINE>VALLEY OF THE KINGS, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rapidly multiplying bacteria
are eating away vivid pictures from the walls of King Tut's tomb,
one of Egypt's most-visited tourist sites.
   Specialists have begun applying an antidote they hope can arrest
the bacteria, but antiquities officials say the original color never
can be restored to the small, pox-like black specks and blotches
marring the walls.
   ``The situation inside the tomb is extremely serious,'' said
Mutaw'ie Balboush, the Egyptian Antiquities Organization's director
for upper Egypt. ``Damage is appearing almost everywhere you look
among the figures.''
   At the start of the winter tourist season in early November,
officials were so worried they considered closing the tomb to let
conservators work unhindered.
   After the antidote was developed last week, however, work to save
the paintings was scheduled before and after tourist hours.
   Tutankhamun, a young pharaoh who died in 1323 B.C., was buried in
a makeshift tomb stuffed with riches in the barren Valley of the
Kings _ the southern wasteland where royalty and nobility were
buried for 500 years.
   During tourist season, his single-chambered tomb draws more than
2,500 visitors a day.
   Its wall paintings, some with colors as bright as the day they
were painted, depict noblemen and officials transporting Tut's mummy
to the tomb. They include a unique scene of the ``Opening of the
Mouth'' rite in which the dead king is given eternal life.
   ``We can't simply remove the infection, because the bacteria have
become part of the paint itself,'' said restoration director Shawky
Nakhla. ``We have to put the bacteria in a situation that won't
endanger the tomb itself.
   ``In the past the bacteria were dormant, but something has
triggered them to life. When we looked at them in Cairo, they were
so active they were duplicating every day.''
   They found four kinds of bacteria and actinomycetes _ an
intermediate step between bacteria and fungi that in humans cause
abscesses under the skin.
   Omar Arini, science officer at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, said
bacteria have been present in Egyptian tombs since they were sealed
thousands of years ago.
   ``If something changes the environment inside a tomb, such as a
rise in humidity, then bacteria can come to life,'' Arini said.
   ``When this happens, the situation is extremely dangerous not
only for the tomb but for others in the vicinity. The bacteria can
spread.''
   Nakhla said bacteria in Tut's tomb could have been activated by
high humidity, difficult to control with so many visitors. And the
number of tourists is expected to increase dramatically during peak
season over the next two months.
   Though smaller and with lesser-quality paintings than some of the
62 nearby tombs, Tut's burial place mesmerizes visitors.
   It owes part of its allure to the myth of a curse visited on
anybody who violates it. It gained prominence in the 1920s and
1930s, after a number of people from the expedition team that found
the tomb in 1922 died unusual deaths.
   Egyptologists scoff at the idea. Grave robbers violated the tomb
at least twice in antiquity and Egyptologist Howard Carter, the
expedition leader, died naturally in 1939 at age 66.

<HEAD>Pinochet Seen Leading Army Back To Barracks, Away From Politics</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military President Augusto Pinochet, his
15-year-old rule nearing an end, is swiftly moving his army back to
the barracks and away from the political battlefield where he
suffered a major defeat in October.
   Political observers and specialists say recent government and
military appointments by Pinochet are aimed at restoring the army's
professionalism and reaffirming his leadership over the service,
which has served as the backbone of his power since a 1973 coup.
   ``He is trying to preserve the army after the electoral defeat he
led it into,'' said Ricardo Lagos, a socialist and prominent
opposition leader.
   In an Oct. 5 referendum, Chilean voters rejected a proposal by
Gen. Pinochet and other military commanders that he remain in power
until 1997. As a result, he was obliged to call open elections,
planned for late next year, and must hand over power in March 1990.
   ``Pinochet is now a dictator with a deadline,'' Lagos said. He
suggested that the 72-year-old president, who is army commander, is
paving the way for his scheduled departure from power in 16 months.
   In early November, Pinochet ordered the largest overhaul in the
army in 35 years. He sent 16 generals into retirement and moved
other high-ranking officers from political posts in the government
back to purely military duties.
   Among them were several generals and other top officers who
participated actively in his referendum campaign or were outspoken
in their support for his continued rule.
   The changes, while corresponding to the regular year-end
reorganization of the army's high command, were the largest since
1952. Pinochet told reporters during a recent provincial trip that
the step was part of ``the transfer from a military government to a
civilian one.''
   In yet another indication of his plan to lead the final stretch
of his lame-duck government with minimal military participation,
Pinochet reshaped his 16-member Cabinet. Only one active military
officer remained, compared to four in his previous Cabinet.
   In addition, in mid-November he appointed seven civilians and
four retired military men to head 11 of the nation's 13 regional
governments. Only two active-duty officers stayed on, in Santiago
and the extreme southern territory of Magallanes. Previously, active
officers serving as regional government chiefs totaled 12.
   Augusto Varas, a sociologist specializing in military affairs,
disagreed with some opposition politicians who saw the changes as
prompted by pressures on Pinochet from within the army.
   ``This should be seen as a decision of Pinochet himself,'' Varas
said in an interview. ``These things do not happen against the
commander's will. To the contrary.''
   Varas said he thinks Pinochet is ``trying to protect the
institution after the defeat, because it was too involved in the
political campaign.''
   Gabriel Valdes, a centrist opposition leader and a potential
candidate to succeed Pinochet in the 1989 election, called the
changes ``positive, because they show a concern with the army's
professionalism'' instead of politics.
   Varas said, ``This process in the army favors the restoration of
democracy, because it generates a consensus among civilians and the
military that the armed forces must be dedicated to their
professional duties, not to politics.''
   He said the process shows that the military ``have understood the
tremendous damage it makes to them getting involved in politics.''
   ``I think they are leaving power `inoculated' against future
political involvement,'' Varas said.
   He said Pinochet, by assuming the task of restoring the army's
professional standards, is also seeking to reaffirm his leadership
of the institution, which has about 57,000 men and is by far the
most powerful of the military branches.
   But Varas and others stressed that the army's discipline and
loyalty to Pinochet remain strong.
   According to a 1980 constitution promulgated by his government,
Pinochet can remain as army commander for at least four years after
he leaves power in 1990. He has not stated his plans, but Varas said
he thinks he will step down sooner.
   He said he believes the process in the army is also having a
strong impact on the other armed services and encouraging similar
processes.
   The Chilean military are estimated to have a combined force of
100,000 men. In addition, the militarized national police, the
Carabineros, have 29,000 men. The Carabineros have shared the
government duties with the other branches under Pinochet.

<HEAD>Ethics Investigator Subpoenaed Records On Wright's Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The special counsel investigating House Speaker
Jim Wright has subpoenaed records on work his wife, Betty, did for a
partnership between Wright and a Fort Worth real estate developer
and investor, according to a source familiar with the case.
   The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
investigators for outside special counsel Richard J. Phelan had
subpoenaed and received records of transactions, working papers and
memos related to Mrs. Wright's work for George A. Mallick.
   Until 1984, Mrs. Wright was paid $18,000 a year for advice that
she gave to an investment venture formed by the Texas congressman,
Mallick and their wives in 1979, according to financial disclosure
statements filed by the speaker.
   With the six-month ethics probe of Wright entering its home
stretch, the investigators are examining transactions underlying the
partnership company, Mallightco, in much greater detail than
available in public records, the source said.
   Wright's financial disclosure form shows that he apparently
exchanged stock worth between $50,000 and $100,000 for his initial
share of the partnership, which was formed to manage investments in
stocks, real estate and precious and semi-precious stones.
   He listed the value of his Mallightco holdings, which were later
placed into a blind trust, at between $100,000 and $250,000. The
trustee disclosed last July, two months after the ethics probe
began, that the assets had been disposed of.
   Wright's investments with Mallick are not mentioned in the
six-count resolution which spells out the bounds of the
investigation by the ethics panel, formally known as the House
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.
   The complaint against Wright involves charges that he improperly
used his office to lobby federal officials, used campaign funds to
pay for publication of a book on which he received some $55,000 in
royalties, and used rent-free a Fort Worth condominium owned by
Mallick's son.
   Committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., declined to comment on
whether Phelan is probing Wright's financial dealings with Mallick
or on other matters under investigation. But he denied that any such
scrutiny would amount to an expansion of the investigation.
   ``I am totally satisfied that Phelan's office has not in any way
expanded the scope of the preliminary inquiry,'' Dixon said. ``I
cannot comment or explain why a particular issue is relevant'' to
the initial six charges.
   Dixon also said he was not concerned that Wright's attorney,
William Oldaker, also is acting as counsel to others who testified
before the ethics panel, including Mallick and Carolos Moore, a
Wright campaign contractor who published the book that is a subject
of the probe.
   Oldaker did not return phone calls earlier this week. But he told
the Washington Post that he represents at least three other
witnesses in the case. He declined to name them but defended the
practice as ethical so long as each witness is aware of his
representation of the others.
   However, Wright's chief accuser, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said
in an interview that the multiple representation suggests collusion
among the witnesses.
   ``If that's not a collusive defense, I don't know what is,''
Gingrich said, adding that he had sent a letter to Dixon asking if
the ethics panel had approved the arrangement.
   Supporters of Wright have been complaining in recent weeks that
the probe, which may cost upwards of $800,000, has grown far beyond
its original intent and become a fishing expedition.
   They cite trips by attorneys to Texas to interview Wright's
political opponents from decades ago and an apparent new look at a
40-year-old unsolved murder case that involved one Wright opponent.
   Wright has said repeatedly that he is confident the probe
ultimately will find no wrongdoing, and aides say the controversy
will not impede Wright's re-election as speaker when leadership
posts are handed out the week of Dec. 5.
   Dixon said he expected the investigators to finish taking
depositions from witnesses by the end of next week, but declined to
say when a final report might be issued. The panel could recommend
no action, or it could file a formal statement of alleged violations
and hold a disciplinary hearing.

   The parents of child prodigy Adragon De
Mello agreed Wednesday to have their son named a temporary ward of
the court, temporarily halting plans for him to attend graduate
school.
   Augustin De Mello, the boy's father, said his son intended to
begin advanced studies in mathematics at the Florida Institute of
Technology in Melbourne, Fla., this fall.
   Following Wednesday's court decision, Adragon De Mello will
remain at least six months in the foster home where he has been
since his father was arrested two months ago for investigation of
child endangerment.
   Adragon gained national attention in June when he graduated at
age 11 from the University of California at Santa Cruz after earning
a bachelor's degree in computational mathematics in one year instead
of the unusual two years.
   According to the 1989 Guinness Book of World Records, Adragon is
the youngest college graduate.
   County officials won temporary custody of the child Sept. 19,
after the boy's mother, Cathy Gunn, alleged that De Mello had
threatened violence and previously made a suicide pact with his son.
   Police found five loaded handguns and suitcases filled with
ammunition, but no charges were filed. De Mello, who denied making
the death pact, was taken to a psychiatric institution and he was
under observation little more than a day. Superior Court Judge
Thomas Black made Adragon a ward of the court in an agreement with
the boy's parents, welfare officials and attorneys. He will decide
March 7 whether to make the child a permanent ward.
   Earlier this year, Adragon's mother, Cathy Gunn, filed a lawsuit
to gain custody of the child after Augustin told reporters that the
boy may go abroad for graduate school. De Mello and Gunn, a Silicon
Valley technical writer, lived together until 1986 but were never
married.

   As the saying goes, some people would
rather be right than president. Many Missoula County residents would
rather write than settle for a president.
   Voters wrote in 1,514 names instead of simply checking off the
candidates listed on the Nov. 8 ballot, said Wendy Cromwell, county
elections manager.
   That number led the state and topped the county's previous record
of 1,044 write-ins, set in the June primary, she said.
   Write-ins included professional politicians such as Jesse Jackson
and Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and sports personalities like Chicago
Bulls star Michael Jordan and the late karate expert Bruce Lee.
   Jackson received 54 votes for president, and Dole chalked up 19.
   An Oliver North-Clint Eastwood ticket for president-vice
president received one vote, and someone paired up network news
anchormen Tom Brokaw of NBC and Dan Rather of CBS for the
presidential ticket.
   Cromwell attributed the number of write-in votes to the ease of
writing on the county's optic scan ballot and to an editorial in the
Missoulian newspaper recommending write-ins in Montana's U.S. Senate
race.

   A newly found mineral has been named for
him, but don't ask Lehigh University geology professor Charles Sclar
to identify it.
   He's never seen ``sclarite.''
   Sclar was accorded the honor by Peter J. Dunn of the Smithsonian
Institution and Joel Grice of the National Museum of Natural Science
in Ottawa, Canada.
   The two named it after Sclar to recognize his years of digging
for and researching minerals.
   ``I got this letter unsolicited in the mail one day, and there it
was. ... My eyes popped out. I had no idea this was going to
happen,'' Sclar said after learning he would be joining an elite
group of about 15 people a year who have new minerals named after
them.
   Sclar and his students during the last 20 years have extensively
studied the area's zinc ore deposits. Sclarite, he said, is similar
to loseyite, another rare zinc carbonate.
   The new mineral and its name, which was approved by the
Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names of the International
Mineralogical Association earlier this year, will be duly recorded
among the approximately 2,500 known mineral species in the Glossary
of Mineral Species.
   Sclar said minerals can be named after people or towns, but the
name must have a connection to mineralogy.
   ``You can't name something after your Aunt Tillie,'' he said.

   Americans might be sitting down for a traditional
Thanksgiving feast of fish or venison if it hadn't been for some
skillful marketing by turkey producers after the Civil War.
   ``There is no rhyme or reason for us to have turkey on
Thanksgiving except that business promoted it,'' said Thomas V.
DiBacco, professor of business history at American University's
Kogod College of Business in Washington, D.C.
   Then again, DiBacco said Wednesday, the history of Thanksgiving
is replete with commercialization by an assortment of innkeepers,
grocers and retailers.
   DiBacco, who has studied the business ties to national holidays,
said the Pilgrims who gathered for the first Thanksgiving feast in
1621 in Plymouth, Mass., probaby ate fish and venison as the main
dishes.
   The holiday was observed only irregularly in various parts of New
England until the early 19th century when it became a regional
fixture, he said.
   ``Thousands of people would trek to New England in this period.
Business played a big role in it _ the inns and the taverns and the
sight-seeing businesses. But it was still a New England affair,'' he
said.
   As the population grew outside New England, DiBacco said, grocers
and other businessmen looked longingly at the annual tourist exodus
to New England for Thanksgiving celebrations. They decided there was
money to be made in getting people to stay home for a holiday, and
several states were persuaded to declare Thanksgiving Days of their
own, he said.
   In the midst of the Civil War and partly as a sign of unity,
President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of thanksgiving
and prayer in 1863.
   After the war ended, poultry producers in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Maryland started pushing turkey as the main dish
for Thanksgiving, DiBacco said.
   Turkey was relatively expensive at the time, going for about 10
cents a pound while average wages ran between 10 and 15 cents an
hour, DiBacco said. That made turkey more profitable to producers
than chicken.
   Illustrators of the day picked up the line and started depicting
Pilgrims at the first Thanksgiving with sumptuous turkeys and piping
hot pumpkin pies, another anomaly since pumpkins were usually boiled
in the early 1600s.
   ``The gimmick ultimately worked,'' DiBacco said. ``Businessmen
had induced Americans to associate the holiday with cuisine that had
no relation to what you had back in Plymouth or New England.''
   Invigorated, other businessmen moved in, using the holiday to
blend family values with the Christmas shopping season and
preparations for winter. Ads counted down the ``shopping days'' from
Thanksgiving until Christmas, and touted the rewards of buying for
others.
   The premise, DiBacco said, was ``this was a good time for
planning to buy.''
   Businessmen helped persuade President Franklin D. Roosevelt to
change the date of Thanksgiving in 1939 from the last Thursday in
November to the next-to-last Thursday so the Christmas buying season
would be a week longer.
   But the change caused some confusion as some Americans celebrated
on both Thursdays. Congress officially made Thanskgiving the fourth
Thursday in November starting in 1941.
   DiBacco said business infleunce is evident in most national
holidays, from the gift-giving at Christmas to the flowers and candy
at Mothers Day.
   ``We live as much in image as in reality, and the image in this
case is greater than the reality,'' he said.

   Money never made up for Christina Onassis'
rootless childhood or the loss of the father she idolized. It could
not ease the pain after three members of her family died within two
years, or save any of her four marriages.
   ``The sudden death of Christina Onassis closes a circle that has
all the makings of a Greek tragedy,'' the daily newspaper
Eleftherotypia said in an obituary. It spoke of the ``tragic fate''
of the Onassis family, which it described as ``a dynasty of death.''
   Christina was 37 when she died on Saturday during a visit to
friends in Buenos Aires. Friends and relatives said she was happy.
Newspapers suggested she had a romantic interest in the brother of
her hostess.
   An autopsy report gave the cause of death as acute pulmonary
edema, accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Family members discounted
the possibility of suicide.
   ``A happy person could never commit suicide and Christina was
content and very happy,'' said Mary Onassis, an aunt. ``Christina
was in the best part of her life.''
   Mario Falak, president of the Alvear Palace Hotel in Buenos
Aires, said: ``She reserved a suite through Dec. 4. She had so much
baggage our employees had to make two trips to the airport.''
   Ioannis Georgakis, vice-president of the Alexander Onassis Public
Benefit foundation, dismissed suicide reports that arose when
medicine bottles were found on Christina's bedside table.
   ``She had no health problems and it just seems her heart was too
tired to overcome the attack,'' he said.
   Greek newspapers quoted friends as saying the bottles probably
contained diet pills. Christina experienced wild swings in weight
throughout her life, often caused by alternating crash diets and
food binges.
   She was born Dec. 11, 1950, in New York City and spent her
childhood shuttling from there to London, Paris, Monaco, Switzerland
and Greece.
   The three members of her immediate family died in only two years.
Christina's brother Alexander was killed in a plane crash in January
1973, her mother Athena died of a heart attack in October 1974 and
her father Aristotle died of bronchial pneumonia in March 1975.
   ``She could never escape the consequences of a rootless
upbringing,'' according to a ``Aristotle Onassis,'' a 1977 biography
of the Greek tycoon. ``Never an eager student, she learned dancing
under Margot Fonteyn and was educated at a series of expensive
finishing schools. ... She emerged a good linguist but with no sense
of place.''
   Its authors, five investigative reporters on the staff of London
Sunday Times, described Christina's relationship with her father as
``complex and self-contradictory.''
   Onassis women ``had to be satisfactory vehicles for
self-promotion and adoring females; and they had to simultaneously
accept his engulfing protectiveness and withstand his massive ego,''
the biographers wrote.
   Christina was 25 when her father died, and the event had an
enormous emotional impact. News reports said she spent the last two
weeks by his bedside and had to be sedated for more than two days
after his death.
   The biographers quote her as remarking that she found
relationships with men difficult ``because, how can I fall in love
when I have a father like mine?''
   Her love life was as turbulent as her father's.
   She married Joseph Bolker, a Los Angeles real estate broker, in
1971 and they were divorced nine months later. The second marriage,
to Greek shipping heir Alexandros Andreadis, lasted only until 1976.
   Husband number three, Soviet shipping executive Sergei Kauzov,
came on the scene in 1978 and departed two years later.
   Last was Theirry Roussel, a French pharmaceutical heir, in 1984.
Divorce proceedings followed eight months later. They have a
daughter, Athena, now 3.
   Aristotle Onassis married Athena Livanos, daughter of a wealthy
Greek shipowner, in 1946 and she bore him two children, Alexander in
1948 and Christina.
   They separated in 1960 after his highly publicized affair with
opera star Maria Callas.
   He married Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy in 1968 and Athena later
became the wife of his business rival, shipowner Stavros Niarchos,
who was married to Athena's sister, Eugenia, until her death in 1970.
   Reports at the time indicated Christina and her father's new wife
did not get along, and the relationship worsened after Aristotle
Onassis died.
   In April 1975, Christina ordered the personal belongings of
Jacqueline Onassis removed from Skorpios, the Ionian Sea island the
family had owned since 1963.
   ``The hate that developed between Christina and Jackie Onassis
determined her future,'' the newspaper Eleftherotypia said in its
obituary.
   Christina plunged into her father's business.
   ``For two years she sat behind a desk learning every phase'' of
it, Apostolos Zambelas, an aide, said in a 1983 interview.
   He said her business training had begun soon after Alexander was
killed.
   ``Alexander was being groomed as the natural heir, something
Christina sort of resented,'' Zambelas said. ``Eventually she got
more than she bargained for.''
   Her brother's death was a turning point in Christina's life.
   Eleftherotypia said in its obituary: ``They shared the same
distress over Jackie _ the widow, as she called her _ who
monopolized their father's attention.''
   Ta Nea, another Athens paper, said: ``Alexander's death left her
inconsolable. It was the moment she understood that her apathy was
over and that she would have to run the fortune.''
   Georgakis, the Onassis Foundation executive, said a board of
trustess will manage the fortune until Athena becomes of age.

   Threats of violent resistance
to even cautious reform of race policies are becoming reality, and a
showdown appears imminent between the government and white
extremists.
   In the latest incident Nov. 15, a white gunman opened fire on
blacks at random in downtown Pretoria, fatally wounding seven
people. Authorities arrested Barend Strydom, a 23-year-old former
policeman linked to the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   President P.W. Botha's government, which warned extremist groups
previously, responded by banning the White Liberation Movement, a
small group that has held a few public rallies in the past year. It
is the first white extremist group ever banned in South Africa.
   The White Liberation Movement advocates ``clearing out'' blacks
living in white urban areas. The government described its members as
``fanatical right-wing extremists (who) favor an active form of
violence to take racism to its extreme.''
   Johan Schabort, a biochemist who formed the group in 1985, said
banning it reduces the ``outlet for frustration of white South
Africans.''
   ``Now we cannot control people who are worried about their race
survival,'' said Schabort, who claims about 1,000 members and many
more sypathizers.
   Although no white extremist organizations had been banned, the
government has declared 23 anti-apartheid groups illegal and
detained or restricted hundreds of black activists this year alone.
   Right-wing white groups have increased in both numbers and
prominence in recent years as the National Party government
implemented gradual race reforms and proposed limited power-sharing
with blacks.
   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs, and the official apartheid policy of race discrimination
preserves power and privilege for the 5 million whites.
   Officials did not say why they acted only against the White
Liberation Movement, which is much smaller than the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement led by Eugene TerreBlanche.
   TerreBlanche has built his organization into the largest of the
far right. Nearly all its members are Afrikaners, the descendants of
white settlers who dominate the government.
   Thousands of rural and blue-collar whites attend the movement's
rallies, at which TerreBlanche delivers spellbinding speeches about
an all-white state and rejects any concessions to the black majority.
   Despite repeated threats, the government has not yet acted
against the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, possibly because of worry
about its vow of violent resistance to any reduction of white
privilege.
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said recently: ``There are whites in
this country who can put together a more efficient violent
organization than the African National Congress,'' the main
guerrilla group fighting white domination.
   Asked why the government does not detain whites as often as black
anti-apartheid activists, he said: ``It is not a question of
arresting a few people and that's the end of it.''
   The government portrays itself as a haven of stability in the
increasingly militant struggle by blacks and extremist whites.
   About 170 bombings have occurred since a nationwide state of
emergency was imposed June 12, 1986. Officials have blamed most of
them on the African National Congress, but the targets of several
recent explosions have been anti-apartheid groups.
   ``There should be no doubt that right-wing violence is quite as
evil and destructive as that of the left,'' the government-run South
African Broadcasting Corp. said in a recent editorial.
   Black activists have raised the possibility of involvement by
government security forces in attacks on anti-apartheid activists
and organizations.
   After receiving several death threats in March, the Rev. Allan
Boesak said many anti-apartheid leaders ``have been assassinated in
South Africa. I want the world to know the light of suspicion should
fall on the South African government and the police if something
should happen.''
   Police often boast of their success in capturing ANC guerrillas
and pre-empting their attacks, but have announced no progress in
recent cases of violence widely blamed on white extremists.
   Among them: A bomb destroyed a Johannesburg building that housed
several anti-apartheid groups, fire damaged offices of
anti-apartheid church groups in Pretoria, a bomb exploded in a
Johannesburg disco frequented almost exclusively by blacks and a
fire was set in an anti-apartheid group's offices at the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
   The Conservative Party, which opposes all concessions to blacks,
split from the National Party in 1982 and now is the largest
opposition in Parliament. Some of its Parliament members belong to
the TerreBlanche's organization.
   Other groups preaching an all-white homeland are the Boerestaat
Party and the Orangeworkers.
   Hercules Booysen, chairman of the Orangeworkers, said of the
action against the White Liberation Movement: ``The government will
keep on banning organizations until only itself is left.''

<HEAD>Government To Require Rear-Seat Shoulder Belts In Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government plans to require
automakers to install rear-seat shoulder belts in all new cars
beginning with the 1990 model year.
   The announcement Wednesday by the Transportation Department came
just hours after a private research group, the Institute for Injury
Reduction, publicly criticized the department for not requiring
shoulder restraints in rear seats.
   Critics for several years have questioned the degree of safety
provided by belts that fit only across the lap. Most cars have this
kind of belt in the rear seat.
   Benjamin Kelley, president of the Institute, said motorists are
faced with ``a pick your poison choice'' because in some types of
accidents the lap belts provide added protection, while in others
they contribute to the severity of injuries.
   The Institute was formed by trial lawyers involved in auto
accident cases.
   A National Transportation Safety Board study two years ago said
that in some cases the lap-only belt made some injuries more severe
because they caused the body to violently jackknife upon impact.
   Diane Steed, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said in a statement that the lap and shoulder belt
combination in rear seats ``will be an important safety addition,
provided they are used.'' Her agency is part of the Transportation
Department.
   Ms. Steed also urged motorists whose cars are equipped only with
lap belts in the rear to use them. She said they are ``effective in
protecting passengers in a crash, especially in preventing the
injuries and fatalities that occur when people are ejected'' from
their vehicle.
   The proposed requirement for shoulder belts in rear seats is not
likely to become final until next year. Initially, it would apply
only to new cars and does not address the question of retrofitting
the tens of millions of automobiles now on the road that have
lap-only belts for rear-seat passengers.
   The rule would apply to small trucks, convertibles, vans and
utility vehicles starting with the 1991 model year.
   At a news conference Wednesday in which it criticized the lack of
a federal requirement for rear-seat shoulder belts, the Institute
for Injury Reduction also charged that the design of many
shoulder-restraint seat belts is dangerously flawed.
   The Institute said the ``window shade'' belt design used in an
estimated 120 million cars, including virtually all U.S. models
built since the mid-1970s, should be altered because it permits the
belts to be worn too loosely.
   The design allows the shoulder restraints to loosen when a car
occupant shifts forward or sideways. Automakers say this is
desireable because it makes the belts more comfortable and thus
encourages their use.
   Unless the shoulder restraint is manually retightened _ with a
slight tug forward on the belt _ its effectiveness in a crash may be
reduced significantly, Kelley asserted.
   Spokesmen for the auto manufacturers and federal auto safety
officials said they are aware that some people may be wearing their
shoulder belts _ whether in the front or rear seat _ too loosely,
thus reducing passengers' protection.
   But the industry and federal officials defended the belt design,
saying it does not constitute a safety hazard. They also argued that
if the belts were tighter many motorists might not wear them, thus
raising the risk of severe injury or death.
   ``We have no evidence that window-shade (belt designs) are
defective or present a safety problem,'' said Ms. Steed.
   ``The concept was to make the belts more user friendly so we
could get the percentages of (belt) users up,'' said Bill Peacock, a
spokesman for Ford Motor Co.
   Kelley, however, maintained that a loosely fitted safety belt
``can result in horrendous injuries'' and that many car occupants
may not even be aware their belt is too loose.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, rushing to complete
its final budget under a compressed time schedule, is declaring
victory in its effort to reduce next year's budget deficit by $35
billion without resorting to new taxes.
   Joseph Wright, head of the Office of Management and Budget, said
the administration had reached its goal of cutting the projected
deficit to $100 billion for the 1990 fiscal year that starts next
Oct. 1.
   Wright said Wednesday this would be achieved through a
combination of asset sales, increased user fees, cuts in domestic
programs and approximately $15 billion in savings in such programs
as Medicare, farm subsidies and federal pensions.
   Wright said the administration was on schedule to send Congress
its $1 trillion-plus spending plan by Jan. 9. It will be President
Reagan's final budget before he leaves office Jan. 20.
   The $100 billion deficit target for 1990 is established by the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. It compares to a deficit for the
just-completed 1988 fiscal year of $155.1 billion.
   The last of the OMB reviews of government agencies' budget
requests was completed Wednesday, Wright said, and the agencies will
now have a little over a week to make any appeals of the decisions.
   He said that by Dec. 2 the administration expects all
presidential decisions on appeals will be completed, meaning that
with Thanksgiving, federal agencies are being given just six working
days to reverse the OMB actions.
   Wright said there had been very little grumbling among Cabinet
secretaries over this shortened time frame, which Wright said was
adopted in part to keep Reagan's final budget from becoming an issue
in the presidential campaign.
   Wright said he was anticipating few appeals primarily because
Reagan two weeks ago stressed the need for harmony in order to meet
the time table.
   ``It is amazing what it does for agency cooperation when the
president says this is what I want you to do,'' Wright said.
   The cuts in benefit programs will not reduce any payments to the
sick or elderly, Wright said. The savings will come, in part, by
slowing the rate of increase in payment schedules for doctors and
hospitals under the Medicare program, he said.
   Wright indicated that farm subsidies would also be a principal
place the administration would look for savings, an approach the
administration has tried before only to run into stiff congressional
resistance.
   The president's final budget is designed to provide an answer to
critics who have charged it was impossible to meet the Gramm-Rudman
deficit targets without imposing Draconian cuts on domestic programs
or boosting taxes.
   ``Whoever believes you must have a major tax package just hasn't
gone through a detailed review of all the programs,'' Wright said.
   The budget will adhere to Reagan's goals of increasing defense
spending by 2 percent over the rate of inflation while exempting
Social Security from any cuts.
   Bush has not said whether he will submit his own budget to
Congress or use the Reagan budget as the basis for opening
negotiations. But Bush has said that whichever approach he takes, he
views cutting the budget deficit as his top priority.
   Richard Darman, Bush's choice as the new OMB director, has
indicated the new administration will also look to the government's
giant health programs for savings, in part because they are growing
so much faster than inflation.
   Without some changes, Medicare, the health-insurance program for
the elderly, is projected to cost the federal government $97.7
billion in the 1990 fiscal year. That is a 14.5 percent increase
from the current fiscal year, reflecting growth that is almost four
times faster than the expected inflation rate.
   Wright said that while many government programs were being cut,
Reagan's final budget would propose spending increases in some
areas. In past years, Reagan has recommended higher spending for the
war on drugs, AIDS research and the space program.

<HEAD>President Refuses To Sign Ethics Act; Anticipates Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said he expected to
be criticized for killing a bill that would have tightened the
clamps on lobbying by ex-government officials, but he asserted the
legislation was ``fundamentally flawed.''
   In announcing Wednesday that he would exercise a pocket veto to
kill the Post-Employment Restrictions Act, Reagan said, ``I am well
aware that there will be criticism.''
   Several lawmakers closely involved in drafting the wide-ranging
ethics bill immediately denounced the president, and the head of
Common Cause said the decision sealed an ``anything goes'' standard
of ethics in the Reagan administration.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., principal sponsor of the House
version, called Reagan's veto, ``an appalling act of hypocrisy'' in
view of Vice President George Bush's previous presidential campaign
endorsement of tighter ethics laws.
   ``This is the ultimate triumph of the Edwin Meese
ethics-schmethics approach to government, in which the rule is that
whatever makes everyone rich, makes them happy,'' Frank said in a
telephone interview from Boston.
   In a three-page memorandum citing his reasons for allowing the
bill to lapse, and thus die, Reagan said the nation should embrace
``more clear, far-reaching restrictions'' on lobbying by
ex-government officials than presently exist. But he called the bill
``flawed, excessive and discriminatory.''
   ``This bill would have begun to make former senior federal
employees unemployable in the private sector after government
service,'' he said. ``Many of the most talented might never sign up
to serve their country, and the country would be the worse for it.''
   Reagan said the bill was confusing, and said that it would have
imposed a double-standard in which there would have been greater
restrictions on post-employment lobbying by executive branch
employees than by former members of Congress.
   The bill he refused to sign would have brought former members of
Congress and senior staff aides under lobbying restrictions for the
first time. The president invoked his authority to kill legislation
by failing to act on it within 10 days from the time he received it,
and during a time when Congress is in adjournment.
   He would have had to sign the bill by midnight Friday for it to
become law.
   The president was remaining secluded at his ranch in the Santa
Ynez Mountains near here today, with plans for a quiet Thanksgiving
dinner with his wife, Nancy, his daughter, Maureen, and her husband,
Dennis Revell.
   Among Reagan's principal stated objections to the ethics bill:
   _It would have gone beyond existing law to subject former
executive branch employees to criminal sanctions for activities
``unrelated to genuine ethical concerns.''
   _It would have barred former officials from representing a client
before any senior federal executive, ``wherever located and no
matter how unrelated to the former officials' government service.''
   Reagan noted that the law would not have taken effect until next
August, well after his term ends. But he said, ``It is fundamentally
flawed and would have made securing good government for America
substantially more difficult.''
   Reagan urged President-elect Bush and members of Congress to
build upon what he said were some good features in the bill so a new
version could be considered next year.
   But the president didn't escape harsh criticism from Capitol Hill.
   In advance of Reagan's decision, Sen. George Mitchell of Maine,
who is campaigning to become the Democratic Party leader in the
Senate, said, ``I would think that after things that have occurred
in this administration, if there's any president that ought to be
enthusiastic about an ethics bill, it ought to be this president.''
   Meese and several other Reagan administration officials have had
ethics problems. Meese resigned as attorney general, although an
independent counsel concluded an exhaustive probe without
recommending Meese's indictment.
   Two former top-level White House aides _ Michael K. Deaver and
Lyn Nofziger _ have been convicted on charges relating to lobbying
activities they carried out after leaving the administration.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the self-styled
citizens lobby, said, ``President Reagan's veto of the most
important ethics bill enacted by the 100th Congress sealed the
`anything goes' ethical legacy of the Reagan administration and is
an ominous sign about the commitment of the incoming Bush
administration to honest and ethical government.''
   Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the two
chief sponsors of the Senate version, vowed that they would resume
their fight for just such an ethics bill when Congress returns in
January.
   Thurmond said: ``The American people demand and deserve strict
ethical standards for government officials. We may have lost this
battle, but not the war.''

<HEAD>Former LaRouche Ally Testifies On Money-Raising Tactics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former money-raiser for Lyndon H.
LaRouche Jr. says he was ordered to get tough with potential
contributors _ whether old ladies or unemployed workers _ because
``the minute you listen to their excuses, you're dead.''
   Christian Curtis, of Alexandria, Va., said at the political
extremist's conspiracy trial Wednesday that top LaRouche staffers
reserved special scorn for those who complained their loans to the
movement were not repaid.
   They were called ``pigs or swine,'' Curtis said as the trial
finished its third day and recessed until Monday.
   Throughout Wednesday, jurors heard LaRouche and his chief
lieutenants described in most unflattering ways by Curtis and former
LaRouche security aide Charles Tate. Curtis quit the organization in
May 1986, and Tate left two years earlier.
   The prosecution fired another salvo by introducing a May 20,
1985, internal memo by a LaRouche staffer which mocked those lending
money to the movement.
   LaRouche and six associates are accused in U.S. District Court of
conspiring to defraud lenders by having a policy of not repaying
more than $30 million in loans.
   LaRouche alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service, by failing to declare as income the money LaRouche
organizations spent for his personal benefit. LaRouche has not filed
tax returns since 1979, the indictment said.
   The defendants contend they intended to pay the loans back, but
ran short of funds after the movement had to spend money to defend
itself against government and news media attacks.
   LaRouche has denied that the money spent on his behalf was
income, arguing much of it went for security to protect him from
assassination plots. Tate, who logged many of the alleged threats in
a file labeled ``Mongoose Reports,'' testified such plots were
products of LaRouche's imagination.
   Tate said the three-time presidential candidate insulted
employees, lied to them and ordered them around while intoxicated.
   ``I had a lifetime of hatred in that organization,'' Tate said,
under sometimes fierce cross-examination from LaRouche lawyer Odin
Anderson. The witness denied that he harbored hatred for LaRouche
now.
   When Tate admitted that other LaRouche staffers often ridiculed
him, Anderson said, his voice rising, ``Now you figure it's your
turn to give it back.'' The remark drew a rebuke from U.S. District
Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr.
   The 1985 memo on fund raising was written by LaRouche aide
Franklin Harrison Bell, who said from the witness stand his comments
about lenders were meant to be humorous.
   The memo said there would be four categories to pay back loans to
LaRouche's campaign organizations if lenders refused to convert the
loans to gifts.
   The ``hardship@medical'' category ``is not for every lender who
pulls at your heart strings about needing money to finance the
opening of his new apple stand,'' wrote Bell. ``It is reserved for
real LaRouche supporters in dire straits.''
   The ``legal@security'' category was reserved for those ``who
have active court cases against us or who pose a danger to the
organization.''
   ``The political category is not the dumping ground for those
phone team contacts who make themselves obnoxious by calling during
soap opera commercials,'' the memo said. ``It is the reserve of
supporters who are judged to be people who will continue to back the
LaRouche faction.''
   The final ``schedule'' category was for ``those supporters who
simply are insistent on getting their monies refunded on a regular
basis.''
   Bell, who still works for LaRouche, disputed prosecution
contentions that there was a policy not to repay loans. ``There was
no policy not to repay loans,'' he testified.
   Curtis, the former fund-raiser, said he was told by superiors
that solicitors had been ``too soft'' in the past.
   ``If you're talking to a little old lady who says she's going to
lose her house, get the money,'' Curtis said he was told. ``If
you're talking to an unemployed worker, get the money. These people
are immoral, anyway.''
   ``The minute you listen to their excuses, you're dead,'' he said
he was told.
   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.
Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum prison term of 65
years and fines of $3.25 million.
   His six co-defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit mail
fraud and mail fraud, and would face lesser sentences if convicted.
   The mail fraud charges stem from promissory notes and letters of
credit sent through the mail by the LaRouche organization.
   LaRouche's co-defendants are chief fund-raiser William Wertz;
legal adviser Edward Spannaus; and former fund-raisers Michael
Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.

   The state House of Representatives is a house
divided against itself, but Gov.-elect Evan Bayh said Wednesday it
will either figure out how to share its power or lawmakers will
spend Thanksgiving in session.
   ``Order the turkeys,'' Rep. Robert Bischoff said after House
leaders earlier Wednesday reported no progress in resolving the
deadlock.
   For the first time Indiana's House is split between 50
Republicans and 50 Democrats. Their leaders went back into
negotiations late Wednesday, but both sides at first said they were
deadlocked in dividing power in the chamber.
   Bayh announced shortly before midnight that the two sides were
trying to nail down final details on an agreement. But the proposal,
whose details were not revealed, still had to be endorsed by each
party's caucus and ratified by the entire House.
   ``From what I've seen over the last 30 hours, the people of this
state have every right to view these proceedings with disappointment
and alarm,'' said Bayh, the Democratic secretary of state presiding
over the House organization.
   ``The people of Indiana did not vote for chaos. They didn't vote
for gridlock,'' he said. ``They did not vote for a government that
can't govern itself.''
   The organization session began Tuesday.
   Then, on two roll call votes, one Tuesday and the other
Wednesday, the House split 50-50 along party lines in its attempt to
elect a speaker, traditionally the second most powerful position in
Indiana government.
   The House adjourned early Wednesday morning and appeared headed
toward a Thanksgiving Day session after no agreement was reached.
   By late Wednesday, Republican candidate Paul S. Mannweiler, who
was House speaker the last two years, said he was willing to
withdraw if his Democratic rival, Michael K. Phillips of Boonville,
would do the same.
   The chamber could then turn to an impartial outsider such as
former Indiana University President John Ryan to preside over the
House, Mannweiler said.
   Phillips flatly rejected that offer, saying he intends to be the
next speaker.
   Bayh kept sending the two sides back to the bargaining table.
   ``We're not going to go home for Thanksgiving if the public's
business needs to be done,'' said Bayh.
   The unprecedented split in the House occurred when Democrats, the
chamber's minority party for 12 years, picked up two seats in the
Nov. 8 election in which Bayh became the first Democrat to win the
Indiana governor's office in 24 years.

<TEXT>
   A state security court has sentenced a
32-year-old schoolteacher to 20 years in prison for shooting Premier
Turgut Ozal during a speech at a June party convention.
   The defendant, Kartal Demirag, had pleaded guilty on Oct. 31,
saying he was sorry and asking the forgiveness of Ozal, whom Demirag
hit in the right thumb with a bullet.
   Demirag was convicted on charges of attempting premeditated
murder, carrying an unlicensed weapon and using a false identity. In
Turkey, convictions and sentences are announced the same day.
   Demirag fired at Ozal twice while the premier was delivering a
speech to delegates of the governing Motherland Party. One of the
bullets hit the microphone in front of Ozal and the other hit his
right thumb.
   Twenty other people and the gunman were wounded as bodyguards
returned the fire. Demirag was captured at the scene.
   Six months before the assassination attempt, Demirag had escaped
from prison in the western city of Mugla where he was serving a
10-year term for knifing a man in a coffee house brawl.
   Demirag has maintained throughout his questioning and trial that
he acted alone. He has said he shot Ozal because the premier did not
declare a general amnesty for prisoners.
   The indictment attributed neo-fascist views to Demirag.
   Turkish papers had reported earlier that Demirag was a member of
the Gray Wolves, the militant youth organization of the defunct
National Movement Party. Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman
imprisoned in Italy for the 1981 shooting of Pope John Paul II,
allegedly belonged to the same organization.
   Prosecutor Nusret Demiral said that Demirag would start serving
the 20-year-term after finishing the sentencing for the stabbing.

   A Hanover state court sentenced two
neo-Nazi leaders to prison terms for assisting in arson attacks on
Turkish immigrants.
   Siegfried Mueller, 25, drew 13 months in prison Wednesday and
Joerg Kiem, 31, drew six months. Both were local leaders of the
neo-Nazi Free German Workers Party, according to court records.
   They were convicted of helping set fire to the offices of a
Turkish translation service and to a boarding house catering to
Turkish immigrants.
   No one was hurt in the September 1986 attacks.
   Bernd Futter, head of the Armed Sport Group EK1, was sentenced to
10 years for the same arson attacks earlier this year.
   Neo-Nazis in West Germany often target immigrants for violent
attacks.

   An 18th-century Italian violin made by Joseph
Guarneri del Gesu was sold in London for more than $1 million, an
auction record for any violin, the auctioneers Sotheby's said.
   An unidentified buyer purchased the instrument for $1,059,344
Wednesday from the estate of the late president of the Swallow
Airplane Co., Sam Bloomfield of Wichita, Kan.
   The violin is known as the Baron Heath, after an Italian
consul-general in London, Baron John Benjamin Heath, who owned it
just over a century ago.
   It was made in 1743 by Guarneri, who worked in Cremona and is
considered by some violinists to be at least the equal of his more
famous fellow countryman, Antonio Stradivari, who died in 1737.
   The previous violin auction record was 473,000 pounds (then
$889,000) for a 1709 Stradivarius known as the Marie Hall, sold in
London on March 31.

   A trucking company from East Germany,
a Soviet bloc country, delivered building material for bombproof
aircraft hangars to a NATO military installation in Denmark, a
newspaper reported.
   An East German truck driven by two East Germans pulled up to the
guardhouse of Tirstrup airbase in west Denmark Nov. 3 with documents
showing that the supplies came from neutral Austria, the
Jyllands-Posten daily said Wednesday.
   The materials were for hangers meant to protect NATO warplanes
from bombers of the Soviet-bloc alliance, the Warsaw Pact.
   ``We thought it was an Austrian company that would deliver the
materials. So we were much taken aback when we learned that the
order had gone to an East German firm,'' the paper quoted base
commander Lt. Col. Egon Baek as saying.
   The truck was unloaded outside the base, the report said.
   A spokesman for the entrepreneur firm WTK, one of the contracters
building the 71 reinforced hangars, said the Austrian supplier had
hired the East German transport company.

   U.S. Customs Service agents seized a Colombian cargo
jet and fined the airline $4 million after finding 250 pounds of
cocaine in the aircraft's hold early Wednesday, a spokesman said.
   It was the third time agents at Miami International Airport
discovered smuggled cocaine in packages aboard Lineas Aereas del
Caribe jets in as many months, said Customs spokesman Cliff
Stallings.
   Inspectors with the Customs Contraband Enforcement Team seized
the DC-8 cargo jet following Flight 236 from Bogota and Baranquilla,
Colombia, after opening a wooden crate and finding the cocaine
inside.
   No arrests have been made, Stallings said.
   It was the first time the Customs Service seized one of LAC's
jets, but cocaine seizures have become almost routine with the
airline, Stallings said. Agents recovered 25 pounds of the drug Nov.
6, two pounds Sept. 1 and made 10 seizures overall on LAC jets since
1981, he said.
   LAC has signed the Customs Carrier Initiative Agreement, which
commits the airline to providing significant security and inspection
procedures to reduce or eliminate drug smuggling on its aircraft,
Stallings said.
   Penalties for unmanifested drugs are $500 per ounce for marijuana
and $1,000 per ounce for cocaine.
   Customs will hold the DC-8 as a lien against the fine until the
airline furnishes a letter of credit and agrees to improve its
inspections, he said.
   ``What we want to make sure is that the airline is making a
tangible, honest effort to improve their security,'' Stallings said.
``This amount of cocaine is not a small amount of cocaine.''

<HEAD>Bushes Spending Quiet Thanksgiving At Family Retreat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush and his
wife Barbara are spending a quiet Thanksgiving here at their family
vacation retreat after the vice president sought to reassure
residents of this oceanside community that their lives won't be
disrupted by his presidency.
   ``Barbara and I want to continue to be good neighbors,'' Bush
told several thousand townspeople on Wednesday at a rally on the
village green.
   He apologized if his presence, and the increased security it
entailed, would tie up traffic in town and make lives for residents
more difficult because ``I want to come here a lot'' as president,
just as he has been doing all his life.
   ``I mean it when I say I don't want to complicate your lives,''
Bush said.
   Today the Bushes were to have a private turkey dinner with just
two invited guests, two longtime trusted employes _ Don Rhodes, who
works for Bush in his Senate vice presidential office, and
housekeeper Paola Rendon.
   The dinner will be a break from past Thanksgivings for the
Bushes, when many of their five children and ten grandchildren have
been present.
   But Bush aide Stephen Hart said the Bushes were ``looking forward
to a private time'' this year, and that other members of the Bush
family all had made separate plans.
   The Bushes, with their spaniel ``Millie'' in tow, flew here on
Wednesday from Washington after Bush announced that retired Air
Force Gen. Brent Scowcroft would serve as his national security
adviser. Scowcroft held the same job in the Ford administration,
when Bush headed the CIA. It was Bush's sixth top-level selection.
   Praising Scowcroft and other members of his emerging Cabinet,
Bush told the rally here, ``We've hit the ground running. We're
putting together a good team.'
   About half the permanent population of this seacoast town
responded to invitations from the Bushes to attend the festivities.
It was his first time back here since before the Republican
convention last August.
   After flying on Air Force Two to Pease Air Force Base in nearby
Portsmouth, N.H., Bush and his entourage finished the trip by
helicopter _ for the first time _ landing on the grounds of St.
Ann's Episcopal Church here, where Bush had first worshiped as a boy
on summer Sundays with his family.
   ``I'm wondering what my old man would say if he could see his
little boy now,'' Bush said, referring to his late father, Sen.
Prescott Bush, R-Conn. The vice president recalled he had been
coming to the family vacation home in every one of his 64 years
except one _ during World War II.
   He repeated a campaign pledge to permit lobstermen to continue
working their traps in the cove alongside his house, despite
security concerns of the Secret Service.
   And he vowed to drive his speedboat slowly in the river that runs
through town and promised to ``try not to hold up traffic.''
   ``And if we do, let me ask you as neighbors to signify your
displeasure in some other way than those very active hand gestures I
spot from time to time as we go through town,'' he joked.
   ``I want Kennebunkport to retain its magic,'' Bush said.
   Meanwhile, efforts by aides to Bush and defeated rival
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis to schedule a meeting between the
two for this weekend fell through on Wednesday because of scheduling
difficulties, according to Bush sources who insisted upon anonymity.
   However, such a session is likely to occur in the near future,
the sources said.
   In announcing his appointment of Scowcroft, Bush said the retired
general, ``has made and will continue to make important
contributions to the design of U.S. foreign policy.'' He praised
President Reagan's current national security adviser, Colin Powell,
for ``an outstanding performance.''
   Bush said he would count on Scowcroft, 63, ``to coordinate the
development of my national security policy.''
   Bush also he still hasn't made up his mind on the choice of a
defense secretary, and said he was sorry if the delay created some
discomfit for the man most widely speculated to be in line for the
job, former Senate Armed Services Chairman John Tower, R-Texas.
   ``I understand the insatiable curiosity about who's going to be
staffing this administration. I understand it. But I'm less tense
about it than I used to be,'' Bush said.

   Tony Award-winning playwright David Henry Hwang
hopes to rediscover his musical roots when he teams up with composer
Philip Glass to create ``The Voyage,'' a work commissioned by the
Metropolitan Opera.
   The production is set to be staged in October 1992 to mark the
500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America, Metropolitan
Opera officials say.
   ``This is a collaboration we're very excited about,'' Bruce
Crawford, the Met's general manager, said Tuesday.
   ``We have seen a plot outline, which is really more about
discovery than about Columbus, and although we have not yet seen any
of the libretto, I don't expect there will be any significant change
in course,'' Crawford said.
   ``The Voyage'' will be Hwang's first libretto, but he said he has
a strong musical background that predates his theater work.
   ``I'm a pretty decent violinist,'' Hwang said. ``I was trained as
a musician before I was interested in any other art, and I suppose
my introduction to the theater was playing violin in a pit
orchestra.''
   The production, Hwang's second collaboration with Glass, is to be
directed by David Pountney of the English National Opera.
   Hwang's play ``M. Butterfly'' won the Tony for best Broadway play
last season.

   A thief who broke into Robert DeNiro's
hotel suite as the Oscar-winning actor slept has been arrested,
authorities said.
   The man, who took more than $3,000 worth of clothing and the keys
to DeNiro's rented Mercedes-Benz, was arrested Wednesday. The car,
which also was stolen, was recovered, police said.
   William Dalton, 25, was booked him for investigation of receiving
stolen property, said police Lt. Norman Eriksen.
   The break-in occurred Sunday as DeNiro slept in the Sunset
Boulevard hotel room in West Hollywood, police said.
   DeNiro, a two-time Oscar winner for his roles in ``Raging Bull''
and ``The Godfather: Part II,'' has also starred in ``Taxi Driver,''
``The Deer Hunter'' and ``The Untouchables.''

   ``Family Ties'' actress Courteney Cox says she is
tired of playing the prissy intellectual and is hoping to land a
role as a wanton bombshell.
   When the NBC comedy ``Family Ties'' wraps up its final season,
Cox, who plays Michael J. Fox's girlfriend, will hardly be
misty-eyed.
   ``Everyone's ready to move on,'' Cox said in December's Self
magazine. ``They've written just about everything you can write
about a family.''
   Now, Cox wants to play a complex character.
   ``I'm kind of itching to do a very real drama, something like ``
'night, Mother,'' or a romantic lead. I always play the
intellectual, never the sexy or the bad girl.''
   Cox, who was Bruce Springsteen's dance partner in the video for
``Dancin' in the Dark,'' also said she feels she has outgrown her
youthful image.
   ``I don't feel like the sweet little girls I play,'' said the
24-year-old actress.
   ``If anything, I'm a little too old for my age,'' she said. ``I
started working when I was young, I lived on my own, I dated an
older man.''

   Mel Gibson, the swaggering actor who has starred
in such movies as ``Mad Max'' and ``The Year of Living
Dangerously,'' says he is ``tired of beating myself up'' and has
given up drinking alcohol.
   The New York-born, Australian-raised actor said in US magazine's
Dec. 12 issue that he is instead focusing his attention on his wife,
Robyn, and five children.
   Gibson, 37, said he made the change after exhausting himself by
starring in four movies in 1984.
   Anthony Hopkins, who co-starred with him in ``The Bounty,'' said
at the time, ``He's in danger of blowing it unless he takes care of
himself.''
   The magazine recalled his arrest for drunken driving while
shooting ``Mrs. Soffel'' and that he looked miserable on camera when
he was a presenter at the 1984 Academy Awards.
   ``Yeah, I used to drink a lot of beer,'' he said.
   But, he said, ``Your physical side runs down. So you just stop
one day and think, `My God, I'm really beating myself up.' ''
   He finally quit cold turkey because he said he realized it ``just
doesn't do you any good.''

<HEAD>French Court Rules Colorized ``Asphalt Jungle'' Cannot Be Broadcast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Paris court refused a request from the American
media giant Turner Broadcasting that a French channel be allowed to
broadcast the colorized version of John Huston's black-and-white
classic film ``The Asphalt Jungle.''
   Turner Broadcasting colorized the 1950 film, which was to be
shown last summer on the private French network Channel 5.
   In June, Huston's heirs asked a Paris court to ban the film from
French airwaves, arguing that the American director always opposed
the computer colorization of films that were orginally made in
black-and-white.
   Attorneys representing Turner Broadcasting argued that the film
was not the property of Huston but of Metro Goldwyn Mayer, the film
studio that paid Huston's salary. Turner acquired the films as part
of a deal with MGM.
   The French court said artistic rights belonged to MGM and Huston,
not to Turner, and issued a restraining order on Wednesday
preventing Channel 5 from showing the film.

<HEAD>Despite Burgeoning Popularity, State Lotteries Have Their Critics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supporters of state lotteries see the games and their burgeoning
popularity due to multimillion-dollar jackpots as a way to increase
government revenue without raising taxes, but critics say the games
are a bad bet for many people.
   In states where lottery revenue goes toward education, the
lottery can stiffen public resistance to paying higher taxes to
support schools, critics say.
   They also say lotteries have no impact on the services they were
designed to finance because the money is used to replace, rather
than supplement, other revenue sources.
   And a long-held argument against lotteries is that they take
money from those who can least afford it.
   Despite the criticism, lottery sales are sizzling.
Multimillion-dollar payouts are so common they hardly make news
anymore.
   In October, California gave away a $61.98 million jackpot, the
world's largest lottery prize ever.
   Lottery ticket sales are expected to reach $14 billion to $15
billion this year, up from $11.4 billion last year.
   And they'll probably rise. Six new state lotteries are opening
this year, and voters in four other states gave the go-ahead on
Election Day for lotteries. Already, 28 states and Washington, D.C.,
have lotteries.
   Of the $11.4 billion, which excludes commissions to ticket
sellers, about $4.8 billion went into state coffers and $6 billion
went back to winners. The rest went for administrative costs,
according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Some state legislatures
set a percentage of lottery revenue that must go back to the state;
some permit lottery officials to decide the state's cut.
   In five states, lottery revenue is split among several
beneficiaries. In Colorado, half the revenue goes to capital
construction, 40 percent pays for conservation, and 10 percent for
parks and recreation.
   Twelve states put lottery revenue in the state's general fund. In
eight states, lottery money pays for school-related expenses.
   But critics say lottery money has no impact on budgets in most
states.
   ``In many respects it is inappropriate to say that as the lottery
goes up, education spending goes up,'' said Robert H. Koff, dean of
the School of Education at the State University of New York in
Albany.
   J. Blaine Lewis Jr., head of the North American Association of
State and Provincial Lotteries, said it would be a mistake to rely
on lottery revenue to increase expenditures, because lottery sales
fluctuate. ``What if your lottery goes down 5 percent? Then you have
5 percent less than you need,'' he said.
   In some states, educators object to getting money from a lottery
based on ``moral grounds,'' said Illinois School Boards Association
spokesman Jerry Glaub.
   But California educators have a different objection.
   ``I think California educators would be delighted to have the
lottery in place had it not undermined other efforts to increase
funding,'' said James W. Guthrie, a University of California
professor and head of Policy Analysis for California Education, a
private research organization.
   Guthrie conceded that state aid to schools has risen in recent
years. But, he added: ``It's at the local level where school
districts attempt to pass a bond that we run into the perception
that the schools aren't hurting, because of the lottery.''
   ``That is a false perception,'' agreed California lottery
spokeswoman Susan Kossack. ``The lottery provided over $800 million
(in the 1987-88 fiscal year) for education, and that's a lot of
money but it's only 2.5 percent of the public education budget.''
   In Pennsylvania, the lottery pays for programs for the elderly.
   Shirley Sharp, spokeswoman for the American Association for
Retired Persons in Pennsylvania, said it has worked so well that
other constituencies are clamoring for a share.
   Massachusetts has devised a revenue-sharing program in which each
of the state's 351 cities and towns gets a portion of lottery
revenue for discretionary purposes, with the amount based on
population.
   ``People are confident that even if they don't win, there is
still some benefit coming back to their communities,'' said David
Ellis, the state lottery spokesman.
   One of the oldest arguments against raising money through
lotteries is that the games are a regressive tax: People with the
lowest incomes contribute the most money.
   But Ralph Batch of the Public Gaming Research Institute said that
theory ``is not substantiated by 100 surveys.'' Besides, he said,
``when you are buying a lottery ticket on a voluntary basis, it's
not a definition of what I know of as a tax.''

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Thursday,
and share prices lost ground on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after
rising for eight consecutive trading days.
   The dollar closed at 121.15 yen, down 0.63 yen from Tuesday's
close of 121.78 yen. Opening at 121.07 yen, the currency moved in a
range of 121.05 yen and 121.28 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 145.86-point
winner Tuesday, lost 90.09 points, or 0.31 percent, to close at
29,340.03.
   The currency and stock markets were closed Wednesday for a
national holiday.
   The dollar opened lower in Tokyo trading following the currency's
overnight decline in New York, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
On Wednesday, the currency closed at 121.25 yen in New York.
   ``At the moment, buying and selling orders are quite balanced and
the dollar's downward force is not so strong, although the dollar
once dived to the 120-yen level,'' he said.
   Currency sources said the Bank of Japan intervened in the market
to save the dollar from further decline. The central bank refused to
comment.
   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters
Thursday morning the central banks of major nations, including the
Bank of Japan, will intervene in the currency market when necessary
to support the U.S. unit.
   On the stock market, players were inclined to sell to collect
profits after consecutive gains for the last nine trading days, said
a dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   ``The index has become quite high, and some participants are
getting a little cautious about the trend,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Japan Celebrates Thanksgiving For Its Overworked Laborers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly harvested rice was offered to the gods on
Japan's own Labor Thanksgiving Day, an unusual midweek national
holiday falling on the eve of the day people in the United States
count their blessings.
   Wednesday's holiday was intended to reward the Japanese for their
hard work year-round and also to mark the traditional thanksgiving
for the harvest.
   Millions of people saw a government broadcast of a feature-length
cartoon Wednesday to encourage the Japanese to pay more attention to
their personal lives. In the cartoon, workaholic Mr. Uchide ruins
his health by working 30 years without ever taking sick leave or
being late for work.
   Eventually, his boss learns he has to allow his employees more
time for themselves. Uchide learns to spend more time with his
family.
   The Labor Ministry commissioned the cartoon ``to reach the entire
family in a way that would be easily understood,'' said Yasushi
Fukushima, manager of the ministry's Wage and Welfare Division.
   Labor Thanksgiving Day, traditionally a thanksgiving for the rice
harvest, has since World War II also served as Japan's Labor Day.
   At the imperial palace, 87-year-old Emperor Hirohito's failing
health prevented him conducting the traditional ceremony, called
Niinamesai or Feast for the New Tasting. A palace official said
ritualists performed it, offering newly harvested rice to the gods
with Crown Prince Akihito and other imperial family members in
attendance.
   Japanese work an average 2,150 hours a year, compared with 1,924
hours in the United States and 1,655 hours in West Germany,
according to the Labor Ministry. That's 60 more work days a year
than West Germans.
   Some firms require employees to work as much as 3,000 hours a
year, according to the government-affiliated Leisure Development
Center.
   Japanese rarely take more than a week or two of annual vacation,
fearing it would put too great a burden on their co-workers, said
Dr. J.I. Shibata, a psychologist who cares for people with
work-related neuroses.
   Last year, says Fukushima, only 28.5 percent of Japanese workers
actually had two days off a week, every week. In April, government
employees began taking two days off every other week _ just like 80
percent of private-sector employees.
   In its first revision of the Labor Standards Law in 40 years, the
government in April set an undated goal to shorten the legal work
week to 40 hours from 48.
   It was responding to public pressure to make Japan a more
pleasant place to live. The law also is intended to boost economic
activity through increased leisure spending.
   Earlier this year, Takashi Ishihara, head of the Japan
Association of Corporate Executives, urged the government to act to
``translate cash-rich Japan into a truly affluent society.''
   The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan said 66 percent of
people it polled felt they work too hard. About 40 percent said they
worked overtime voluntarily for no extra pay.
   Japan's virtual full employment reflects shortages of skilled
workers in services, construction and computer industries.
   But younger generations are accustomed to affluence _ summers
spent shopping, windsurfing and snorkeling; vacations abroad. As
they reach adulthood, they are challenging the work ethic that has
made Japan an economic powerhouse, says social psychologist Sumiko
Iwao of Keio University in Tokyo.
   Young people ``are more interested in their own private
satisfaction or gratification,'' Ms. Iwao said in a recent lecture.
   ``I think that the productivity of the Japanese economy will
decline, but I do not think it's such a bad thing,'' Ms. Iwao said.
   ``It's insane for people to say that their hobby is just work.''

<HEAD>Father of Slain Bodyguard Seeks Clemency for President's Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of a slain presidential bodyguard
has asked President Saddam Hussein to pardon his own son, whom the
president has accused of killing the guard, state-controlled
newspapers said today.
   In a letter published in all government dailies, Hana Gegeo asked
the Iraqi president to call off a judicial investigation ordered
this week to determine how his son, Kamel Gegeo, died.
   Saddam, in a letter carried by the state media on Monday, ordered
Justice Minister Akram Abdul Qader Al-Douri to investigate the
killing. Al-Douri on Tuesday appointed a three-member committee of
judges to carry out the investigation, the official Iraqi News
Agency said.
   Saddam's letter said Kamel Gegeo, a Christian and trusted
bodyguard, was slain Oct. 18 after shooting his gun in a private
villa near the presidential palace. In a dispute when Gegeo refused
to stop, Odai hit him over the head with a bat, the president's
letter said. Gegeo died later in the hospital.
   Odai, 25, the eldest of the president's five children, tried to
commit suicide after hearing that Gegeo died and was himself
hospitalized before being jailed three days later, Saddam's letter
said.
   The Iraqi leader said Odai tried to commit suicide on two other
occasions while in prison, but his life was again saved by doctors.
   Hana Gegeo called the killing of his son `` an act of fate and
the will of God which could not have been avoided.''
   ``It was an hour of trial,'' Gegeo said in his letter. ``Let God
and history be witnesses that we have passed this trial.''
   The state-run media have carried a series of articles and
editorials asking Saddam to pardon his son.
   Informed sources in Nicosia said the bodyguard, believed to be in
his 20s, was the son of the president's cook and the governess who
raised his three daughters.
   Odai resigned as president of Iraq's Olympic Committee after the
incident but stayed on as head of the governing board of Saddam
University, founded this year.
   The sources in Nicosia, frequent travelers to Baghdad who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Odai has a reputation as a playboy
who drives a Porsche sports car and frequents the capital's
nightclubs and discotheques.

   The life-saving benefits of quitting cigarettes
continue well into old age, according to a study that found that
even people in their 70s significantly reduce the risk of heart
attacks and death when they kick the habit.
   ``The message is that it's never too late to quit,'' said Bonnie
Hermanson, who collaborated with colleagues from the University of
Washington and the Mayo Clinic in the study. ``Older people with
heart disease have just as much benefit from quitting as younger
people do.''
   The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
disputes the idea that old people have already suffered too much
damage from smoking to benefit from quitting.
   The researchers found that during a six-year period, the death
rate of older people who continued to smoke was 70 percent higher
than that of people who had recently stopped smoking.
   The study was based on people who already had clogged heart
arteries, a condition that affects an estimated 3.9 million
Americans over age 54. Other research is under way to see if older
people with healthy hearts also live longer if they stop smoking.
   The work was based on men and women older than age 54 who took
part in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study, or CASS, a major review
of coronary bypass surgery.
   Cigarette smoking is considered to be the chief avoidable cause
of death in the United States. According to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control, smoking was responsible for 320,515 deaths in 1984.
About one-third of them were smoking-related fatal heart attacks,
strokes and cardiac arrest.
   ``There is some feeling that it's too late for older people to
quit, because they have had too much damage over the years,'' said
Hermanson. However, ``there is very little data dealing with elderly
people. Most smoking studies are done on those who are middle aged
or younger.''
   Dr. John H. Holbrook of the University of Utah said the study
shows the advantage of quitting in people whose heart disease has
been carefully documented.
   ``No matter how old you are, no matter how long you've smoked,
there's a benefit to quitting,'' he said. ``And as far as heart
attack is concerned, the benefits begin to accrue within a few
months.''
   The risk of lung cancer, another major smoking hazard, also drops
when people stop smoking, although the reduction is not as fast as
the fall in heart attacks.
   The study was based on a comparison of 807 people who had quit
smoking within the previous year and 1,086 people who continued to
smoke. During six years of followup, 210 of the quitters and 391 of
the continuing smokers died.
   The differences cannot be blamed on more severe heart disease
among those who continued to smoke. In fact, the quitters were
actually sicker than the smokers.
   Dr. Bernard J. Gersh, a co-author of the study at the Mayo
Clinic, said the lower death rate among the quitters resulted
largely from fewer heart attacks.
   Among the study's results:
   _After the researchers adjusted their findings for severity of
heart disease, those who continued to smoke had a 70 percent higher
risk of death.
   _Thirty-eight percent of the smokers died during the six-year
period, compared with 28 percent of the quitters.
   _Among those over age 70, 50 percent of the quitters died during
the followup, compared with 68 percent of the smokers.
   _The greatest difference in survival was among those with
moderate degrees of heart disease.
   _The benefits of quitting were similar for men and for women.
   _The advantages of giving up smoking that were seen in older
people were virtually the same as those in middle-aged people.
   ``On the basis of these results,'' the researchers wrote, ``we
believe that it is worthwhile for physicians to encourage their
elderly patients with coronary artery disease to quit smoking as
strongly as they do their younger patients.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ``ingenious'' research technique published
today should aid research into genetic diseases by helping
scientists produce mice with altered genes, scientists say.
   The procedure helps scientists select genetically altered cells
to transplant into a growing mouse embryo, an initial step in
creating the mice, researchers said.
   While that can be done relatively simply now for a few genes, the
new technique will work with many if not all mouse genes. It thus
expands the usefulness of a recently developed strategy for
targeting genes for replacement or alteration, the researchers said.
   Such a strategy may be used one day to replace defective genes in
people, said researcher Mario Capecchi.
   The selection technique is described in today's issue of the
British journal Nature by Capecchi, biology professor at the
University of Utah and member of the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, with colleagues Suzanne Mansour and Kirk Thomas.
   The procedure is ``ingenious,'' Brigid Hogan and Karen Lyons of
the Vanderbilt University Medical School in Nashville, Tenn., wrote
in an accompanying editorial
   In interviews, other scientists said alternative techniques also
are under study, and the new procedure may turn out to be preferable
for only some experiments.
   Genes are the inherited chemical ``blueprints'' that govern the
structure and functioning of cells. They lie along threadlike
structures called chromosomes.
   Scientists can alter genes or add new ones by inserting genetic
material into cells. They have recently learned how to aim the
insertions at particular locations on the chromosome.
   But their aim is not perfect, leaving them with the problem of
determining which cells have taken up the insertion in the right
place, and which are carrying it somewhere else. Researchers want to
select only the right cells to slip into a mouse embryo.
   The key to the new procedure lies in the design of the stretch of
genetic material to be inserted. Researchers add two genes to help
in the later selection process.
   One gene makes a cell resist a toxic drug called G418. The other
gene, which makes a cell vulnerable to the drug gancyclovir, is
added in such a way that it will be deleted if the inserted genetic
material ends up in the correct place on the chromosome.
   The selection process begins after researchers insert the genetic
material into thousands of cells. The cells are exposed first to the
drug G418, and then gancyclovir.
   Only cells that have taken up the genetic material somewhere in
their chromosomes will survive exposure to G418. And only cells that
took it up in the right place will live after being exposed to
gancyclovir, because only they will have removed the vulernability
gene.
   In one experiment, only about one in every 2,000 cells that took
up the inserted material had it in the right place. But 19 of 24
cells that survived the selection procedure had it in the right
place, nearly a 2,000-fold improvement in the concentration of
useful cells.
   Alternatives to Capecchi's technique are under study, and the
choice of which to use in research will probably depend on what a
scientist seeks to accomplish, said Alexandra Joyner of the Mount
Sinai Hospital Research Institute in Toronto and Raju Kucherlapati
of the University of Illinois in Chicago.
   Capecchi's method may be best for disabling genes and a different
method may be preferred for making tiny alterations, Joyner said.

finish at 121.78 yen. The currency opened at 121.07 yen, and ranged
between 121.05 yen and 121.28 yen. The markets were closed Wednesday
in Tokyo for the Labor Thanksgiving national holiday.
   Today's closing rate was the lowest since 1973, when Japan
abandoned the Bretton Woods agreement and began floating the yen.
   That agreement, implemented at the end of World War II, had fixed
the exchange rate at 360 yen to the dollar.
   The dollar opened lower in Tokyo following the currency's
overnight decline in New York, said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of Daiwa
Bank. On Wednesday, the currency closed at 121.25 yen in New York.
   ``Trading here just followed what had happened in New York. There
was no major economic factor in Tokyo to lower the dollar
otherwise,'' he said.
   Currency market sources said the Bank of Japan has intervened in
the market, trying to save the dollar from further decline. The
central bank routinely refuses comment on its activity.
   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters today
that the central banks of major industralized nations, including the
Bank of Japan, will intervene in the currency market when necessary
to support the U.S. unit.
   Daiwa Bank's Kinugasa said: ``The dollar recovered slightly when
investors sold yen as they heard TV news about the emperor.''
   Emperor Hirohito, 87, who has been bedridden for more than two
months, discharged and vomitted a ``small amount'' of blood this
afternoon for the first time in about two weeks, according to the
Imperial Household Agency.
   Kinugasa said most market players were sitting inactive because
there was no trading in the United States due to the Thanksgiving
holiday today.
   Meanwhile, the 225-issue-Nikkei Stock Average lost 90.09 points,
or 0.31 percent, to close at 29,340.03. On Tuesday, the index
reached a record high of 29,430.12.
   Share prices fell back in a wait-and-see mood following the
eight-day gain, said an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's
largest brokerage.
   ``Players were inclined to sell to collect profits after the
consecutive gains,'' he said, speaking anonymously. ``The index has
become quite high, and some participants are getting a little
cautious about the trend.''
   In a moderate trading, volume on the first section was estimated
at 900 million shares.

<HEAD>Court Rejects ``Clergy Malpractice' In Youth's Suicide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dismissal of a ``clergy malpractice''
suit brought by relatives of a man who committed suicide after
pastoral counseling is a deliverance from legal interference in
spiritual matters, church leaders said.
   The man's father, however, called the state Supreme Court ruling
``a disaster.''
   The court ruled Wednesday that non-professional counselors have
no legal duty to refer a patient to a psychiatrist or take any other
steps to prevent suicide.
   ``Neither the Legislature nor the courts have ever imposed a
legal obligation on persons to take affirmative steps to prevent the
suicide of one who is not under the care of a physician in a
hospital,'' said the opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas.
   Imposing legal responsibilities on pastoral counselors would also
be ``impractical, and quite possibly unconstitutional,'' because
those duties ``would necessarily be intertwined with the religious
philosophy of the particular denomination,'' Lucas said.
   ``This is not a very good day for us,'' said Walter Nally, whose
24-year-old son, Kenneth, killed himself in April 1979 with a
shotgun blast. ``In fact, it is a disaster.''
   Eight years ago, Nally and his wife, Maria, sued Grace Community
Church of the Valley for $1 million over their son's death in what
experts in church-state relations said was the first ``clergy
malpractice'' suit filed in the United States. The 10,000-member
church in Sun Valley is the largest Protestant church in Los Angeles
County.
   The Nallys' lawsuit said the church's pastors who counseled their
son for several years knew he was suicidal and should have sent him
to a psychiatrist. The parents also said the church's method of
counseling, which allegedly stressed sin and guilt, worsened his
depression and helped cause his death.
   As evidence, the Nallys offered a taped statement of one of their
son's counselors, Richard Thomson, made 18 months after Kenneth's
death, saying that ``suicide is one of the ways that the Lord takes
home a disobedient believer.''
   But the court said that statement was irrelevant because there
was no evidence Thomson ever said anything like that to Nally.
   While referring to Nally's death as a ``profound tragedy,'' Lucas
said the church and its counselors ``had no duty to Nally on which
to base liability for his unfortunate death.''
   Allowing a lawsuit against an unlicensed counselor for failing to
refer a client to a psychiatrist, on the grounds that the client's
suicide was foreseeable, ``may stifle all gratuitous or religious
counseling,'' Lucas said.
   National religious leaders, who had feared the case could lead to
what they believed was undue interference into the pastoral realm by
the courts, were pleased by the ruling.
   ``Anything that has the effect of dismissing this horrible case
is a deliverance,'' said the Rev. Dean M. Kelley, director of the
religious and civil liberty office of the National Council of
Churches.
   Dennis Kasper, an attorney who represented the National
Association of Evangelicals, said: ``It will reduce the fear of
being sued that clergy have been feeling lately and free them to be
more available to people who need their help.''
   Representatives of every Protestant denomination filed court
documents supporting the defendant, said attorney Samuel Ericsson,
executive director of the Christian Legal Society in Washington.
   ``If it (the ruling) had gone the other way, the law would drive
a wedge between those who need help the most and those who stand
most ready to help,'' said Ericsson, who represented the church in
the suit.
   John F. MacArthur Jr., the pastor of Grace Community Church, said
the ruling will allow the church to carry on with its mission of
``prayerful ministry and spiritual counseling.''

   The Indiana House, evenly split for the first
time in history, broke a two-day stalemate today by agreeing to
share power with alternating speakers in what's being called the
``speaker du jour'' plan.
   The agreement, greeted by a standing ovation in the House and
affirmed by party leaders' handshake at 2:10 a.m., also will give
some powers previously held by the speaker to the chamber's
membership.
   The accord was reached under the threat of a Thanksgiving-Day
session and after two days of closed-door negotiations between
Republican leader Paul S. Mannweiler, Democratic leader Michael K.
Phillips and advisers.
   It would let each political party have a speaker who will serve
on alternate days and give each party a co-chairman and equal
membership on each committee of the 100-seat chamber.
   Democratic Gov.-elect Evan Bayh, who in his capacity as secretary
of state told lawmakers he would keep them in session until they
broke the impasse, applauded the agreement.
   ``I think this is a reasonable outcome, given the 50-50 split in
the House,'' said Bayh, who presided over the House's organization
session.
   Mannweiler and Phillips are scheduled to be formally named
co-speakers next Wednesday when the House reconvenes to ratify a
final draft of the agreement. The House will return for regular
business in January.
   ``These are extraordinary times, and they require extraordinary
action,'' said Mannweiler, who served as House speaker the last two
years.
   ``If given the opportunity, I think it will work,'' he said.
``It's a whole new system for us.''
   Phillips said the agreement ``truly returned the power to the
elected members of this body.'' Phillips, who had predicted he would
be the sole speaker, said the accord restores fairness and equity to
a legislative process dominated too long by speakers, traditionally
the state's second most powerful position.
   The organization session began Tuesday.
   Then, on two roll call votes, one Tuesday and the other
Wednesday, the House split along party lines in its attempt to elect
a speaker.
   The House adjourned early Wednesday and appeared headed toward a
Thanksgiving Day session after no agreement was reached.
   ``Order the turkeys,'' Rep. Robert Bischoff said at one point.
   By late Wednesday, Mannweiler said he was willing to withdraw if
Phillips would.
   The chamber could then turn to an impartial outsider such as
former Indiana University President John Ryan to preside over the
House, Mannweiler said.
   Phillips flatly rejected that offer, saying he intended to be the
next speaker.
   The unprecedented split occurred when Democrats, the chamber's
minority party for 12 years, picked up two seats in the Nov. 8
election in which Bayh became the first Democrat to win the Indiana
governor's office in 24 years.

   Dr. Samuel Broder, a cancer researcher who
helped show the drug AZT is effective in treating AIDS, has been
chosen as the new director of the National Cancer Institute, it was
reported today.
   Citing unidentified senior health officials, The Washington Post
reported in today's editions that President Reagan has decided to
appoint Broder from among three names submitted as candidates for
the job.
   Broder, 43, now is director of the clinical oncology program at
NCI.
   He would replace Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., who recently left a
three-year tenure as head of NCI to become chief physician at New
York's Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
   DeVita was quoted by the Post as saying Broder would make be an
excellent choice to lead the NCI, the nation's largest cancer
research facility. ``He has one of the best minds I have ever run
across,'' DeVita said.
   The other two people considered for the job, according to the
Post, were Dr. John Minna, chief of the NCI-Navy Oncology Branch,
and Dr. Alan Rabson, acting director of NCI.
   The cancer institute, although a part of the National Institutes
of Health, has considerable autonomy because of the emphasis
Congress put on fighting cancer in the 1970s. The NCI chief is the
only one of the various institute heads appointed directly by the
president.

<HEAD>Man Gets Stay Of Execution, Sharpeville Six Death Sentences
Commuted</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with five murderers hanged;

<TEXT>
   The justice minister today
stayed the execution of a young black man, one day after President
P.W. Botha commuted the death sentences of the Sharpeville Six in a
similar politically charged case.
   But five convicted murderers were hanged today in non-political
cases, bringing the number of people executed in South Africa this
year to 115, three of them white.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee granted an indefinite stay to Paul
Setlaba hours before he was scheduled to hang this morning, the
independent South Africa Press Association quoted Setlaba's attorney
as saying.
   The 23-year-old Setlaba was convicted of murder with two younger
defendants under the doctrine of common purpose in a 1985 killing
during a consumer boycott. The doctrine allows for the conviction of
anyone deemed an active participant in a mob that commits murder.
   The stay for Setlaba came shortly after the U.N. Security Council
urged South Africa to halt the hanging, said United Nations
spokesman Francois Giuliani in New York. He said Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar had earlier made a personal appeal to Botha
for clemency.
   The country's highest court had rejected a last-minute appeal by
Setlaba on Wednesday.
   The Sharpeville Six were convicted of a murder that occurred
during a 1984 riot that marked the start of two years of nationwide
unrest.
   The Justice Ministry said Wednesday that the six blacks _ five
men and a woman _ will serve prison terms ranging from 18 to 25
years. The death sentences in 1985 caused worldwide protest.
   Botha's commutation of their death sentences came hours after the
Appeal Court in Bloemfontein, the nation's highest tribunal,
unanimously rejected a petition to reopen the trial.
   The six were convicted of murder in connection with the September
1984 killing of black town councilor Kuzwayo Dlamini by a mob in
Sharpeville, a township south of Johannesburg.
   No evidence was presented that they contributed physically to his
death. They were convicted under the common purpose doctrine, on
grounds of being active participants in the mob that killed Dlamini
during rent riots.
   The Justice Ministry gave no reason for the president's
commutation and Jack Viviers, a spokesman for Botha, refused comment
when reached by The Associated Press.
   Also Wednesday, Botha commuted the death sentences of four white
policemen, all of whom had been sentenced to hang for murder
convictions, the Justice Ministry said. They will serve terms
ranging from 15 years to 25 years.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu suggested today that Botha, by
reprieving both the Sharpeville Six and the white policemen, was
trying to neutralize domestic criticism. Conservative whites had
been seeking clemency for the police, whose victims were black and
mixed-race.
   The attorney for the Sharpeville Six, Prakash Diar, noted
Wednesday that there had been intense international pressure on
Botha to commute his clients' death sentences.
   ``Very important heads of state ... have personally intervened on
their behalf and I think that has made a difference,'' Diar said. He
named President Reagan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany among those who
interceded on behalf of the six.
   ``I am happy for my clients that the state president has sought
to reprieve them, but I am astonished at the number of years they
are going to be spending in prison,'' he added.
   Hassie Mokgesi, father of Sharpeville Six defendant Francis
Mokgesi, said, ``They should have decided to let the boys come
home.''
   Anti-apartheid groups in South Africa, international human rights
organizations and numerous foreign governments had urged Botha to
grant clemency to the Sharpeville Six.
   The Sharpeville Six are: Mokgesi, 31; Reid Mokoena, 24; Oupa
Moses Diniso, 32; Duma Joshua Khumlao, 28; Reginald Sefatsa, 32; and
Theresa Ramashamola, 27.
   The group, convicted in 1985, spent 1,076 days on Death Row.
   The riots in Sharpeville and neighboring townships marked the
start of more than two years of nationwide black unrest. Activists
frequently targeted township councilors for attack, saying they were
collaborators with the white-led government and its apartheid
policies of racial segregation.
   The five men hanged at Pretoria Central Prison today were three
of mixed race and two blacks. The Prison Service said 49 Death Row
prisoners have been granted reprieves by Botha, and more than 200
others still face execution.

<HEAD>Chinese Foreign Minister To Go To Soviet For First Visit In 31
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will travel to Moscow
Dec. 1 for the first visit by a Chinese foreign minister to the
Soviet Union in 31 years, the government said today.
   The two-day visit for talks with Soviet counterpart Eduard
Shevardnadze is expected to set the stage for the first
Chinese-Soviet summit since Nikita Khrushchev came to Beijing in
1959.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said at a weekly briefing
that Qian's talks in Moscow will focus on Cambodia, the main
stumbling block to improved political ties between China and the
Soviet Union.
   ``If the talks between the two foreign ministers on the question
of Kampuchea go well, then the Sino-Soviet meeting of top leaders
can be held soon,'' Ms. Li said.
   China says the Soviet Union must prod Vietnam into withdrawing
its troops from Cambodia before relations can be fully normalized.
   Moscow is Vietnam's chief supplier of arms and credit, and China
supports the anti-Vietnam resistance forces in Cambodia.
   Asked whether the Kremlin's decision to suspend the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Afghanistan could stall plans for a summit, Ms.
Li said only, ``We hope the Soviet Union will continue to make
practical efforts in removing the obstacles between China and the
Soviet Union.''
   China has said there are three obstacles to normalized ties _ the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, Soviet military presence along the
Chinese border and Cambodia. The Chinese regard Cambodia as the most
serious.
   Soviet sources said that after Qian's trip, Shevardnadze will
make a return visit to Beijing, probably in January or February.
   The sources said a visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to Beijing for a meeting with senior leader Deng Xiaoping and other
Chinese top officials could come in the first half of 1989.
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological and strategic
differences in 1960 and fought a short border war in 1969.
   Trade has grown and other contacts have increased since the early
1980s, but China has ignored Soviet appeals to end the long
political freeze.
   Chou En-lai, who served as both premier and foreign minister at
the time, was the last Chinese senior diplomat to visit Moscow, in
1957. Andrei Gromyko was the last Soviet foreign minister in China
when he accompanied Khrushchev in 1959 for Communist China's 10th
anniversary celebrations.
   Ms. Li said the two nations had agreed to exchange foreign
minister visits in 1986, but that the three obstacles had blocked
such visits up to now.

   The dollar was mixed and trading in a narrow range
in Europe today, foreign currency dealers said. Gold prices firmed
slightly.
   Trading was thin due to the American Thanksgiving Day holiday,
and dealers said a sudden large order to sell dollars, or central
bank intervention, could have an exaggerated effect on the market.
   ``Days like this are extremely dangerous because the totally
unexpected can happen,'' said one trader in Rome.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at a record low of 121.15 yen, down 0.63 yen from
Tuesday's finish, despite reported intervention by the Bank of Japan.
   The markets were closed Wednesday in Tokyo for the Labor
Thanksgiving national holiday.
   Later, in London, the dollar was quoted lower at 121.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7170 West German marks, up from 1.7155
   _1.4412 Swiss francs, down from 1.4415
   _5.8665 French francs, down from 5.8685
   _1.9373 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9365
   _1,275.75 Italian lire, down from 1,276.50
   _1.1950 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1982
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8350, slightly cheaper than
late Wednesday's 1.8355.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $419.20 a troy ounce,
down from $419.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $419.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $419.80, up from $419.25 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.29 to close at a bid $421.16.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.14 a troy ounce,
up from Wednesday's $6.12.

   A powerful storm dumped up to 4 feet of snow in the West and was
blamed for one traffic death, and Tropical Storm Keith headed toward
Bermuda today after leaving eroded beaches, twisted mobile homes and
flooded roads in Florida.
   Warnings for heavy snow were in effect early today in mountainous
areas of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Montana and Wyoming, the
National Weather Service said. Backcountry avalanche warnings were
in effect in the Cascades in northern Oregon. Snow watches or
advisories were in effect in parts of North Dakota, Colorado and
Arizona.
   Officials blamed icy roads for causing an accident on Interstate
84 that killed one person at Ladd Canyon in east-central Oregon.
   Up to 4 feet of snow piled up in the Sierra Nevada in Northern
California.
   ``We are totally ecstatic,'' said Bill Jensen of the Squaw Valley
ski resort near Lake Tahoe. ``This will be one of the best, if not
the best, Thanksgiving weekends we've ever had.''
   The storm drenched lower elevations in California on Wednesday,
then tapered off into showers and thundershowers.
   Off Florida, Tropical Storm Keith moved toward Bermuda after its
winds and heavy rains swept across the Florida penisula without
causing major damage or casualties.
   At 5 a.m. EST today, the storm packing 50 mph winds was centered
near 32.4 north latitude and 73.0 west longitude, or 490 miles west
of Bermuda. It was moving east-northeast at nearly 40 mph.
   Forecasters said that unless the storm changed direction or speed
it would reach Bermuda by this afternoon.
   Large sections of Florida shoreline were eroded in the Sarasota
and St. Petersburg Beach areas and on the island of Captiva in the
Gulf of Mexico.
   Heavy winds and rain flipped over a truck in the Tampa Bay area.
Tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged about 25 mobile homes in Lake
County, in the state's midsection, and in Tampa, and flooding was
reported in low-lying areas in the storm's path.
   Keith also was blamed for the derailment of 34 cars of a cargo
train Wednesday near Lakeland because of a railroad bed washed out
by rain.
   The derailment ruptured a natural gas line and forced the
evacuation of 450 people from a square-mile area, but no injuries
were reported. Winds dissipated the gas, and residents returned to
their homes by late Wednesday, Polk County officials said.
   Tampa, Orlando, Daytona and the Cape Canaveral area reported from
5 to 6 inches of rain.

   A man who threw his wife to safety just as
a sniper's bullet pierced his back during a rafting trip cried, ``My
God! I'm paralyzed,'' then told her ``I love you'' shortly before he
died, the woman said.
   Michael and Jamie Heffley and their guide, Jim Burr, were rafting
on the Rio Grande on Saturday near Big Bend National Park when they
came under a barrage of sniper fire from atop 300-foot bluffs on the
Mexican side of the river.
   ``He threw me out of the line of fire so he took the bullet,''
Mrs. Heffley said Wednesday from the Hendrick Medical Center, where
she was recovering from two gunshot wounds.
   ```My God, I'm paralyzed!''' she recalled him saying. ``And he
said, `I love you.'''
   She said when they were pinned down by the snipers, Heffley asked
her if she was ready to die.
   ``He said, `I'm ready to die,' and asked if I was, and I said
`yes,''' said Mrs. Heffley, of Eastland.
   Mrs. Heffley, 32, was shot in the left side and left shoulder.
Burr, 36, suffered a shotgun wound to the right thigh. Burr also
remained hospitalized.
   Heffley, 40, was killed after one of the snipers shot him in the
back with a .30-30 rifle, police said.
   ``I really consider him to be a hero,'' Burr said. ``He was
shielding her in a very exposed area. He gave up his life for her.''
   U.S. and Mexican authorities have been searching for the
attackers, but have not made any arrests.
   Just before coming under attack, the three noticed a campfire and
heard some gunfire, but did not believe they were in danger. They
came under fire as the raft came into a clearing, Mrs. Heffley said.
   ``We just all looked at each other in horror,'' she said.
   At one point Heffley attempted to reason with their attackers,
yelling offers of money to spare their lives. However, she said,
this only seemed to antagonize them.
   ``There was a period there when I actually sat down and calmly
thought, `This is it. I'm not going to get out of here,''' Burr said.
   ``It's the scaredest I've ever been. It's certainly the closest
I've ever come to dying.''
   After her husband was shot, Mrs. Heffley was all alone. Burr had
left for help and she had to survive the night.
   ``I covered myself in 3 to 4 inches of sod _ anything to
camouflage myself,'' she said. ``I sat in one place for an eternity.
It was cold _ 34 to 35 degrees. I was shaking uncontrollably.
   ``All night long I just prayed to God,'' Mrs. Heffley said. ``If
He kept me alive for this long, somebody was going to save me.''
   She was pulled out by rescuers in helicopters.

   Customers scurried back to grocery stores
throughout the Northeast after two major turkey processors issued a
recall of 30,000 possibly spoiled birds.
   One Boston-area store reported customers were still returning
turkeys Wednesday evening. Other grocers said they were inundated by
people worried about birds that were not subject to the recall.
   Lester M. Crawford, director of the Agriculture Department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said no illnesses have been reported.
   Norbest Inc., the nation's fifth largest turkey processor and
distributing company in Salt Lake City, said it voluntarily recalled
20,000 of its ``Family Tradition'' fresh turkeys because of possibly
spoiled necks and giblets packed inside the birds.
   The turkeys were processed for Norbest in Columbia City, Ind.,
and were distributed in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Indiana,
officials said. No other Norbest products or frozen turkeys were
involved in the recall.
   Meanwhile, Giant Food supermarkets recalled 10,000 Shady Brook
Farms turkeys in the Baltimore and Washington areas for possible
spoilage.
   One truckload, which contained 1,800 turkeys, was shipped
improperly but the supermarket chain recalled 10,000 turkeys because
it could not be certain where the bad birds were sent, officials
said.
   Bob Walsh, vice president of sales and marketing for Rocco
Enterprises Inc., the parent company of the Harrisonburg, Va.,
turkey producer, said only turkeys labeled Shady Brook Farms prime
young turkeys that were sold through Giant Food were recalled. Rocco
is the nation's ninth largest turkey processor.
   ``We do believe it was a very isolated situation,'' Walsh said.
   Checks at other supermarket chains in the Baltimore-Washington
area, New York and New England found no problems, he said.
   But grocers said they were inundated with calls.
   ``We've had phone calls like you would not believe,'' said Paula
Alward, bookkeeper for the IGA Foodliner in East Providence.
   Many customers called with questions about their frozen Norbest
turkeys, which were not inculded in the recall, Alward said.
   The store thawed its frozen turkeys so customers could cook them
in time for Thanksgiving dinner, Alward said.
   Mike Ferry, manager at a Star Market in Providence, said the
store also exchanged several turkeys. ``Yes, we're playing musical
turkeys,'' he said.
   The birds in question have the USDA number of P-2487 on the metal
package closure, the federal number of Gobbler's Retreat Inc., a
Columbia City, Ind., plant that processes the turkeys under a
packaging agreement with Norbest, said Norbest spokesman Mike
Korlogos.
   Gobbler's Retreat President Ralph Heine said he shipped turkeys
to Norbest and bagged his own under the Gobbler's Retreat label.
Officials said they did not know how the cause of the spoilage.
   A U.S. Agriculture Department spokeswoman, Susan Rehe, said the
turkeys were processed and distributed between Nov. 1 and Nov. 18.
Norbest notified the department on Tuesday, she said.
   The Norbest turkeys are packaged in pre-printed plastic bags with
the name ``Family Tradition Fresh Young Turkey'' on the label. Near
the bottom of the label, in smaller print, are the phrases, ``Packed
for Norbest'' and ``Keep Refrigerated.''
   Distributors in Rhode Island, Maine and Masschusetts said they
had recovered most of the suspect birds.

<HEAD>President Roh Expected To Call For Pardon For Chun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo is expected to
appeal to the nation in the next few days to pardon former president
Chun Doo-hwan and end controversy surrounding the ex-leader,
according to reports today.
   Government sources, who declined to be identified further, said
Roh was planning to make an appeal in the coming week to pave the
way for a pardon for Chun. The sources said Roh hopes to restore
political calm.
   Roh, to smooth the way for public acceptance of a pardon for
Chun, will take unspecified steps to correct wrongs committed under
the previous government, including the forced dismissal of opponents
and the killing of opposition activists, the sources said.
   A shake-up of the government and the governing Democratic Justice
Party is expected in the next few weeks to remove officials
identified with Chun. Roh reportedly wants to purge all Chun
loyalists and sever connections with the former administration.
   The president is expected to try and meet with opposition party
leaders to seek a compromise over Chun. Opposition leaders say Roh
must resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of the nation.
   Seoul newspapers carried extensive reports today that Roh would
grant Chun a pardon or at least lay the groundwork for amnesty by
appealing for public mercy. ``President Roh, recognizing that Chun's
open apology was the best he could do, has decided to give him a
political amnesty,'' The Korea Times quoted an unidentified
presidential aide as saying.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went on national television Wednesday to apologize for
corruption and repression under his authoritarian government. He
said he accepted full responsibility for misdeeds under his
government.
   The former president said he was surrendering all his property
and going into rural exile. Chun and his wife, Lee Soon-ja,
immediately left Seoul and moved to a Buddhist monastery on the east
coast.
   Opposition and dissident groups have been calling for a probe to
reveal the full extent of corruption and human rights abuses under
the Chun government.
   Top opposition leaders said Chun's apology was insufficient and
demanded a full accounting of misdeeds under his government.
   Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung contends the Chun government
misappropriated billions of dollars that have not been accounted for.
   Public reaction to Chun's apology was still not clear today.
Government officials hope many Koreans will accept Chun's apology as
sufficient and allow him to fade into obscurity.

   Four days of storms and monsoon flooding
in southern Thailand have killed 22 people and damaged nearly a
thousand roads, government officials said today.
   Since Saturday the storms also have destroyed 218 bridges and 67
dikes and irrigation works in 11 provinces of the southern
peninsula, according to officials of the Interior Ministry and
Meteorological Bureau.
   More than 120,000 acres of farmland were reported under water.
   A local newspaper quoted Lt. Gen. Kitti Rattanachaya, deputy
commander of the Fourth Army Region, as troops have been dispatched
to evacuate villagers isolated by floods.
   The English-language Nation also reported that the Thai air force
is airlifting supplies to flood-hit areas, and the Local
Administration department has allocated $1.4 million for relief
operations.

<HEAD>Airline Denies It Illegally Shipped Airplane Parts To Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aer Lingus, the national airline, today
denied an American television report that it illegally shipped U.S.
aircraft parts to Iran.
   ``CBS Evening News'' reported Wednesday night that a federal
grand jury is investigating charges that the Dublin-based airline
has sold millions of dollars of parts for C-130 Hercules transport
planes to Iran since 1981.
   A Justice Department source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that an investigation was under way but
could not comment on its status.
   Oisin O'Siochru, an Aer Lingus senior executive, said the airline
was aware of the investigation.
   But he stressed: ``Let us knock this C-130 thing on the head
straight off. Aer Lingus does not own or operate C-130 aircraft and
has not supplied parts for C-130 aircraft to anybody.''
   CBS said U.S. Customs agents in Miami uncovered evidence
implicating the Irish airline this year when they seized evidence
during an investigation of another aircraft firm.
   The parts helped Iran keep its C-130 fleet, built up during years
of good relations with the United States, in good condition for the
war with Iraq, CBS said.
   Selling U.S.-made parts for the planes, which are used for many
purposes including supplying troops and refueling jet fighters in
flight, was made illegal after Iran seized U.S. hostages at the
Tehran embassy in 1979.
   CBS quoted law enforcement sources as saying Aer Lingus made a
huge profit by ordering parts for its own civilian version of the
C-130 and then illegally shipping them through a subsidiary company
from London to Iran until 1987.
   O'Siochru said that from 1980 to the beginning of 1985, when all
contracts were terminated, Aer Lingus supplied spare parts and small
components for civilian aircraft to Iranian carriers.
   ``We supply spare parts only for aircraft we know something about
and the C-130 is not one of those,'' O'Siochru said,
   ``The aircraft for which we supplied spare parts were
predominately Boeing aircraft, say of the Boeing 747 type. They were
civilian aircraft.''
   Aer Lingus was ``a very minor participant in the supply of
maintenance services to Iran in circumstances where there was all
the appearance of tolerance by the United States of that
situation,'' he said.
   ``Under those circumstances, we really cannot see why this should
be regarded as a very big deal.''
   U.S. regulations were tightened at the end of 1984 and ``when
that was brought to the attention of senior management in Aer
Lingus, a decision was taken to end the contract,'' O'Siochru said.
   If charged with illegally shipping the parts and then convicted,
Aer Lingus faces several million dollars in fines.
   CBS reported that although an indictment is expected, the State
Department has expressed some reservations about bringing charges
against the national airline of a close ally.

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian woman was
fatally shot in the head today in the occupied Gaza Strip, and an
Arab man died of wounds after apparently being beaten by soldiers,
Palestinian doctors said.
   Troops also shot and wounded seven Palestinians in clashes in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, including a 10-year-old boy struck in the
left leg in Nablus' open-air market, hospital officials said.
   One of the wounded, a 21-year-old man from a village near
Ramallah, was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the
stomach, the doctors said.
   A military spokeswoman said she was checking the reports.
   Also today, assailants broke into a mosque in the West Bank's
Kalandia refugee camp, smashing windows, destroying religious tapes
and ripping up holy books. A resident said $1,500 was missing.
   A police spokesman said an investigation indicated the motive was
criminal because the money and two tape recorders were stolen.
Palestinian residents blamed Israeli security forces, but conceded
there were no witnesses.
   ``Our suspicion is that local people from the camp broke into the
mosque to take money and valuables,'' said a West Bank police
spokesman, Mordechai Bareket. ``During their search things fell but
(there was no) intention to damage. It's an entirely criminal
matter.''
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, troops opened fire on
stone-throwing youths in the Shati refugee camp, killing 40-year-old
Nawal Abu Ittryah of Gaza City, an Arab reporter said. Circumstances
of her death were unclear.
   Officials at Mukassad Hospital in Jerusalem said Marwan Kneiry,
27, of the West Bank village of Yaabad died Wednesday after being
brought to the hospital Nov. 7 with a concussion and bruises. His
family told doctors Kneiry had been beaten by soldiers.
   The two deaths raised to 317 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 11-month Arab uprising against Israel's 21-year occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Eleven Israelis have also died.
   The Hebrew-language Haaretz newspaper said that six Palestinian
prisoners were wounded last week during a riot that broke out in the
desert Ketziot prison, where some 2,500 Arabs are being held.
   Army spokesman Lt. Col. Hanan Rubin, in charge of the Southern
Command, denied anyone was wounded in the prison but did not
specifically deny the riot. The Haaretz report did not describe how
the prisoners were wounded.
   Haaretz also said authorities were using prison loudspeakers to
broadcast Hebrew songs throughout the prison grounds in an attempt
to drown out nationalistic Palestinian songs chanted by prisoners.
   A military spokeswoman in Jerusalem said prison guards had only
blasted one Hebrew song over loudspeakers and discontinued the
practice after three minutes because it had not been approved by
commanders.
   Most of the inmates in the desert prison are Palestinians held
without trial or charges under emergency laws established by the
British when they ruled Palestine in the 1940s. The laws are kept in
use by Israel.
   Also today, the army lifted curfews that confined residents to
their homes Wednesday in two Gaza Strip refugee camps and a Gaza
City neighborhood. But the military maintained a curfew on the West
Bank el-Amari refugee camp for the fourth day in a row.
   The 1.5 million Palestinians in West Bank and Gaza, which Israel
seized in the 1967 Middle East war, have been revolting since Dec. 8
against Israeli military rule.

<HEAD>Botha Reportedly Says Mandela Won't Go Back To Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American evangelist Pat Robertson
today quoted the president as saying jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela will not be returned to prison after he leaves a hospital.
   Instead, Mandela may be kept under guard to protect him from
possible assassins, Robertson quoted President P.W. Botha as saying.
   Robertson, a former U.S. presidential candidate, told reporters
he discussed Mandela during a meeting with Botha at government
headquarters.
   Robertson said Botha told him that Mandela ``will not be returned
to prison, but I did not get any indication he would be released.''
   ``I believe President Botha was quite concerned that there's a
real possibility that Mr. Mandela might be assassinated by people
either to the left wing or the right wing of the country, and he
doesn't want that to happen,'' Robertson said.
   ``He (Botha) said he did not feel (Mandela) would return to
prison but would be placed in some type of _ he didn't use the term
`protective custody,' those are my words _ in some other environment
after he finishes his stay in the clinic.''
   Mandela, 70, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
prison sentence for conspiring with other leaders of the African
National Congress to wage an anti-government sabotage campaign.
   He was hospitalized in August for treatment of tuberculosis and
has been recuperating since Aug. 31 in the Constantiaberg Clinic, a
private hospital in a Cape Town suburb.
   Mandela is the most popular leader among South Africa's
disenfranchised blacks, and there has been a prolonged international
campaign seeking his release. In 1985, Mandela rejected a government
offer to set him free if he renounced violence.
   Recently, Botha hinted that Mandela could be released without
meeting this condition, but there has been no definitive government
statement on the matter.
   Robertson is in South Africa for a week, meeting political
leaders and producing shows to be telecast by his Christian
Broadcasting Network.

<TEXT>
   Iraq and Iran exchanged 71 prisoners of war
today, the first day of a Red Cross-sponsored operation to
repatriate more than 1,500 sick and disabled prisoners from the
Persian Gulf war, Iraqi officials said.
   Red Cross officials earlier had said 151 prisoners _ 110 Iraqis
and 41 Iranians _ were to be freed. But only 52 Iraqi POWs left
Tehran aboard a DC-9 jet chartered by the International Committee
for the Red Cross.
   In response, Iraq returned only 19 Iranians aboard the same
plane, which is to shuttle between the two capitals on a daily basis.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus, said fewer Iraqis flew to Baghdad because some had
asked for political asylum.
   Others were no longer eligible for repatriation after Red Cross
doctors verified they had recovered from their illness, the news
agency said.
   Each departing prisoner was given a copy of the Koran, the holy
book of Islam, and Persian craftwork as gifts, the news agency said.
   The DC-9 was to fly between Tehran and Baghdad for the next 10
days to repatriate up to 1,115 Iraqis and 411 Iranians, all sick or
wounded, according to a memorandum of understanding signed by Iraq
and Iran with the Red Cross.
   The repatriation, which is being paid for by an unidentified
Western nation, is the largest prisoner exchange so far between the
countries who agreed Aug. 20 to a cease-fire in their eight-year
war, IRNA said.
   The last POW exchange, of 25 Iraqis and 25 Iranians, took place
Oct. 30, as a mutual goodwill gesture before U.N.-mediated Iran-Iraq
peace talks resumed in Geneva. The talks have made no progess.
   A Red Cross official in Baghdad, Paul Henri Morard, said the
plane would fly the shortest route between Tehran and Baghdad.
Despite the cease-fire, many planes still avoid flying directly over
the joint border.
   The Red Cross proposed to start the exchange Nov. 20, but it was
twice postponed because some prisoners on both sides were unwilling
to return home and sought to go elsewhere, according to diplomatic
sources in Baghdad.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a number of
prisoners asked to leave for an unidentified Western country.
   In addition, some Iranian prisoners want to join the Mujahedeen
Khalq, the Iraq-based opposition group that seeks to overthrow the
government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the sources said.
   Morard said the Red Cross has already registered 50,182 Iraqi
POWs and 19,284 Iranians, but the total number of POWs estimated by
both countries is 100,000. He said the Red Cross has repatriated 765
Iraqi sick and wounded POWs and 613 Iranians since 1981.
   As signatories of the Geneva Convention, both sides are pledged
to repatriate all POWs without delay after ``cessation of
hostilities.'' The sick and wounded should have been returned while
the fighting was still in progress, according to the convention.

   The body of Greek shipping heiress
Christina Onassis arrived in Greece today from Argentina for burial
on her family's privately-owned island in the Ionian Sea.
   Ms. Onassis, 37, died in Buenos Aires on Saturday of an apparent
heart attack, but the cause of death is still under investigation.
   Her body was flown to Athens on a chartered Olympic Airways
aircraft from Geneva after it arrived on a regular Swissair flight
from Buenos Aires.
   Olympic was founded in 1957 by her father, shipping magnate
Aristotle Onassis, who then sold it to the Greek state in 1975.
   Accompanying the body were a group of relatives and Ms. Onassis'
fourth ex-husband, French multimillionaire Thierry Roussel.
   A memorial service will be held for Ms. Onassis on Friday in the
Greek Orthodox church of Aghia Fotini in the Athens suburb of Nea
Smyrni.
   Ms Onassis' body will be flown to northwest Greece early Saturday
and then put aboard a launch for the short trip to the island of
Skorpios, where she will be buried next to her father and her
brother, Alexander.
   Ms. Onassis inherited a fortune estimated at $500 million when
her father died in 1975. The remainder of his $1 billion fortune was
given to the philanthropic Public Benefit Foundation.

<TEXT>
   Miklos Nemeth, a 40-year-old,
Western-oriented economist, was elected Hungary's new premier today,
succeeding Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz as the head of
government.
   Nemeth, who faces the tough task of implementing unpopular
austerity measures and sweeping reforms to boost the stagnating
economy, faced some opposition in Hungary's increasingly outspoken
Parliament.
   On Wednesday, he won the unanimous approval of the Communist
Party's policy-setting Central Committee. Today's ballot on Nemeth
was delayed by objections from one of Hungary's most outspoken
parliamentary deputies, Zoltan Kiraly, who was expelled from the
Communist Party last spring.
   Kiraly said Parliament should have a much fuller debate on the
choice for premier and hold the discussion only after it hearing a
report from leading reformer Imre Pozsgay on plans for changes in
Hungary's political institutions.
   Pozsgay, a Politburo member and minister of state, on Wednesday
billed his report as the government's ``package plan for democracy.''
   In the end, Kiraly's objections to the agenda were overruled. But
45 of Parliament's 383 deputies voted for his proposals and six
abstained.
   In the vote on Nemeth, 27 deputies voted against the new premier,
and 36 abstained, the state news agency MTI said.
   Reszo Nyers, the father of Hungary's innovative economic reforms
in the 1960s, also won parliamentary approval today in the newly
created post of minister of state for economics. Fifteen deputies
voted against him, and another 15 abstained, MTI said.
   Gyoergy Fejti, a Central Committee secretary, told journalists
Wednesday that the two men combined pragmatism with experience.
   Nemeth is expected to continue the ``stabilization program'' of
economic reform that Grosz began when he became premier in June 1987.
   Grosz announced his intention to resign the government post last
month, complying with his promise not to keep both jobs beyond the
end of the year.
   Grosz made no secret of his preference for Nemeth as his
successor. The front page of the independent weekly Reform showed a
picture of Grosz with the caption, ``My choice would be Nemeth.''
   Nyers also had been high in the running for his new post.
According to Communist party sources, parliamentary deputies and
Central Committee members were surveyed before the final decison was
taken.
   Nemeth, who spent a year at Harvard University on a visitors'
program, sees the introduction of a market-style economy as the only
way of pulling Hungary out of economic stagnation.
   In the November issue of the party monthly Social Review, he
described the present economy as ``deformed'' and called for a mixed
economy that would use capital and labor efficiently.
   ``In vain, we have tried to cram practice into theoretical
schemes,'' he wrote, suggesting that a system of leasing branch
offices of large companies could constitute ``a sort of school for
enterprise.''
   Nemeth, a pragmatic technocrat like Grosz, also sees the need for
a reform of political institutions to coincide with restructuring
the economy.
   In his article, widely seen as an unofficial government program,
he recognized the need to acquire the support of society.

   Irmgard Seefried, a renowned Austrian
opera singer, died today, Austrian radio reported. She was 69.
   The report did not say where she died or give the cause of death.
   Ms. Seefried was especially known for singing the role of Susanna
in Mozart's ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' which she performed at the
Vienna opera, Milan's La Scala, Covent Garden in London and New
York's Metropolitan Opera.
   The Austrian soprano also was well known for other roles in
Mozart operas, including Pamina in ``The Magic Flute,'' Zerlina in
``Don Giovanni,'' and Fiordiligi in ``Cosi Fan Tutte.''
   However, her range also included roles in Richard Wagner's ``Die
Meistersinger'' and Puccini's ``Madame Butterfly.''
   Born in 1919 in Bavaria, Ms. Seefried studied at the music
conservatory in Augsburg. In 1943, she joined the Vienna opera,
where she made her debut as Eva in ``Die Meistersinger.'' She stayed
with the opera for the rest of her career.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to combat fraud in the foreign
military sales program, the United States plans to require countries
buying arms with U.S. money _ and their American suppliers _ to
agree first to cooperate with federal investigators, The New York
Times reported today.
   Millions of dollars has been stolen from the program by people
who bribed foreign officials, set up dummy corporations, submitted
false invoices and diverted U.S. aid to secret foreign bank accounts
from which it could not be recovered, the Times said.
   Under the new rules, foreign governments buying arms with
American loans would have to agree in advance to make their records
and files available to federal investigators, the Times reported.
   Likewise, American companies that want to sell weapons to a
foreign government receiving American loans would have to give
investigators access to their records.
   Military contractors have objected to the new rules as burdensome
and unnecessary. Lobbyists for arms exporters also expressed concern.
   Joel L. Johnson, vice president of the American League for
Exports and Security Assistance, told the Times, ``These rules could
impose an enormous, unnecessary administrative burden.
   ``They are designed to make life easy for prosecutors. They are
not likely to deter fraud above and beyond the current
regulations,'' he added.
   But the Justice Department said it faced ``almost insurmountable
problems'' in investigating arms fraud cases involving foreign
countries, according to the Times.
   The new rules were disclosed in letters to several major military
contractors from Lt. Gen. Charles W. Brown, director of the Defense
Security Assistance Agency, and his deputy, Glenn A. Rudd, the Times
reported. The agency supervises foreign military sales.
   The Justice Department told the Times that investigating
corruption in arms aid has been especially difficult in the
Philippines, El Salvador and Egypt.

<HEAD>Genscher To Visit Iran, Offers Role In Gaining Hostage Releases</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Iranian media reports,
background on West German hostages. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister will visit Iran
next week and has offered to act as an intermediary in gaining the
release of foreign hostages held by Islamic radicals, diplomatic
sources said today.
   Iranian media also reported that Hans-Dietrich Genscher may try
to negotiate the release of foreign hostages, and that a special
effort may be made in the case of kidnapped Anglican Church envoy
Terry Waite.
   The Foreign Ministry said Genscher will leave Sunday for two days
of meetings with Iranian government and industry leaders, but it
disclosed no details of the visit, which is expected to focus on the
Iran-Iraq war and means of improving trade ties between Bonn and
Tehran.
   Diplomatic sources said Genscher has offered to talk with Iranian
officials or groups in an effort to gain freedom for the hostages,
including nine Americans, held by pro-Iranian Islamic radicals in
Beirut.
   ``The minister has offered his services to secure the release of
all hostages,'' one official source told reporters. ``And the
Iranian government has assured us that this corresponds with their
aims.''
   The sources all spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus, carried a report from the English-language daily
Tehran Times speculating that Genscher's trip is intended as
mediation in the hostage situation.
   ``Everything points to this being the case, and this accords with
recent moves to have Terry Waite, the Archbishop of Canterbury's
representative taken hostage in Lebanon, released,'' the Tehran
Times was quoted as saying.
   Asked whether Genscher expected a breakthrough in Waite's case,
one source said the case would be raised with Iranian officials, but
that he could not elaborate. Iranian government officials have in
the past contended they have no influence over the Beirut Shiite
groups, but the source said enlistment of the Tehran leadership in
gaining the hostages' release would be pursued.
   Waite and 13 other foreign hostages are held by Lebanese Shiite
groups considered loyal to Iran. There are no Germans known to be
held in Beirut.
   West German officials, including Genscher, have denied media
allegations that they paid for the release of former German hostages
Alfred Schmidt and Rudolf Cordes. The Hamburg-based Bild newspaper
said in September that as much as $22.2 million was paid for Cordes'
freedom.
   Cordes and Schmidt were kidnapped in Beirut in January 1987.
Schmidt was released Sept. 7 of that year and Cordes was freed two
months ago after 20 months in captivity.
   Waite disappeared in January 1987 after leaving his West Beirut
hotel room to negotiate the release of other hostages.
   The longest held hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Genscher will be accompanied by about 30 influential German
businessmen who expect to meet with senior officials of the Iranian
economics and finance ministries as well as industry representatives.
   He will meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and
other senior government officials, but is not expected to see
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the sources said.

   Gunmen killed 17 people and wounded
at least 12 when they opened fire on mountain villagers attending
evening prayers in a private chapel, the military said today.
   The regional military commander, Brig. Gen. Jesus Hermosa, said
the communist New People's Army launched the attack because the
villagers refused to pay ``revolutionary taxes.'' But a survivor
said government-backed vigilantes had accused villagers of being
rebel sympathizers.
   A wealthy landowner who survived the attack said she believed she
was the target because of jealousy. And a military officer who spoke
on condition of anonymity said the military was hunting an
unidentified relative of the woman.
   The dead included four children and two elderly women, officials
and survivors said. A hospital spokesman said five of the wounded
were in critical condition.
   The military also reported today that 31 other people were killed
in scattered clashes nationwide between government troops and
communist rebels and between soldiers and Moslem rebels during the
past three days.
   Survivors of the chapel massacre said the gunmen, some of whom
were wearing fatigues, arrived Tuesday evening in the remote
mountain village of Bagtik, about 340 miles southeast of Manila on
Cebu island.
   One of the survivors, Lolita Gitgit, 28, said most villagers were
in the Roman Catholic chapel praying the rosary when they heard dogs
barking. Several men left the service and tried to drive off the
gunmen with stones but ``they were all mowed down,'' she said.
   The gunmen then sprayed the chapel and an adjacent residence of a
wealthy landowner and chapel owner Cresencia Hermosilia, who was
among the wounded, survivors said.
   Roldan Mangubat, a member of the provincial advisory board,
quoted Mrs. Hermosilia as saying she received a threat from an
undisclosed group not to go ahead with a village festival, held the
day before the attack, because it was too extravagant.
   ``There were many of them,'' said Jose Canelio, 27, who was
inside the chapel when the firing began. ``The shooting continued
for a long time, maybe 20 minutes. When the shooting ended and we
got up, they were gone. Many of us were dead. There was much
moaning.''
   Canelio said he and others made their way to nearby villages to
seek help. Officials in Cebu City heard of the attack only today
because Bagtik is about a two-hour walk from the nearest road and
has no telephones.
   The wounded were taken to the nearest town, Asturias, and
transferred early today to a hospital in Cebu City, about 40 miles
from Bagtik.
   Another survivor, Mercedita Bitoon, 23, told reporters that a few
days ago, a member of an undisclosed vigilante group threatened the
villagers and accused them of communist sympathies.
   The area is a stronghold of a militant farmer organization, which
vigilantes claim is a communist front.
   Hundreds of vigilante organizations operate in the Philippines
and have been organized by the military to help fight the 19-year
communist insurgency.
   Amnesty International and other human rights groups have accused
the vigilantes of widespread abuses of civil liberties.
   Two weeks ago, hundreds of area residents fled to Cebu City,
claiming they were being harassed by soldiers and vigilantes. They
have been receiving food and shelter from local civilian officials.

<TEXT>
   A bungled guerrilla bombing of a
village police station killed a 67-year-old Roman Catholic civilian
and his 13-year-old granddaughter and injured eight people, police
reported.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility in a statement issued to
news organizations and apologized, called the deaths ``tragic.''
   ``The IRA has nothing to gain by the deaths of civilians and in
fact has much to lose in terms of support,'' it said.
   The mainly Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland
under socialist rule.
   A press officer at Belfast police headquarters said the part-time
police station in Benburb, 35 miles west of Belfast, was unstaffed
and locked up for the night during Wednesday night's car bomb attack.
   No security forces personnel were injured.
   Police said the explosion extensively damaged the police station
and up to 12 nearby homes. It was the latest in a string of botched
IRA attacks that have killed at least 19 civilians in the last year
and forced the IRA to issue repeated apologies.
   The police press officer, who declined to be identified, said the
bomb was concealed in a van left near the police station. It
exploded as Barney Lavery and his granddaughter Emma Donnelly, both
from prominent local Catholic families, drove past the station.
   The two had given a ride to an elderly woman and dropped her off
moments before the bomb exploded at 10:50 p.m., hurling their car
into a field.
   The press officer said the guerrillas gave police two telephone
warnings, but that there were no security forces in the area to
clear it before the bomb exploded.
   ``The IRA would know full well that the (police) station was
unmanned at that time,'' he said.
   A Catholic priest, the Rev. Matt Mulroe, gave the church's last
rites to the two victims as they lay in the wrecked car.
   The eight injured civilians were taken to South Tyrone Hospital
in the town of Dungannon about five miles away. Police said the most
seriously hurt had a broken arm.
   They said four of the eight were hospitalized, the rest treated
and released.
   Police said the van was stolen. They said the family that owned
it was held at gunpoint while the van was driven to its target. The
family was later released unharmed.
   On Tuesday night, guerrillas fired a rocket-propelled grenade at
two police jeeps at Castlewellan 25 miles south of Belfast, but
missed and demolished a butcher shop.
   The Soviet-made RPG7 anti-tank rocket narrowly missed a crowded
pub.
   Benburb is eight miles from the village of Loughgall, where last
year police and troops lying in ambush after a tip-off killed eight
IRA guerrillas as they bombed the local police station.
   The worst bungled attack occurred in November last year when an
IRA bomb killed 11 Protestant men, women and children at a memorial
service for the dead of two world wars at Enniskillen, 70 miles west
of Belfast. The bombing, intended for British soldiers, created a
wave of anti-IRA revulsion around the world. The IRA admitted it had
made a grave error.

   Bands, floats and celebrities paraded in front of millions of
people today and Thanksgiving feasts were set out for thousands of
homeless, while American Indians and Pilgrims' descendants moved
toward a reconciliation meeting.
   For most Americans, Thanksgiving heralded a traditional feast of
plates overflowing with turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and gravy,
and enough football to keep armchair athletes fixed for hours.
   Pageant-filled parades snaked down the streets of New York,
Philadelphia, and Detroit today to mark the start of the holiday
season.
   In New York, about 4,000 American Indians and descendants of
Pilgrims were expected to join in a circle dance of friendship at
the Cathedral of St. John the Divine tonight, 367 years after the
Wampanoag Indians and the Pilgrims gathered for their historic
peace-feast in Plymouth, Mass.
   ``It should be an amazing moment,'' said the Rev. James Parks
Morton. ``We, the boat people, will be thanking the natives for
giving us Thanksgiving.''
   ``They tried to stamp out our ways, to destroy our culture,''
said Oren Lyons, chief of the Onondagas who will be joined at the
ceremony by leaders of the Hopi, Northern Cheyenne, Tewa Pueblo and
other tribes.
   ``So we come to 1988, and people are realizing the validity of
traditional Indian ways in northern America. When people come
forward and say `We're sorry, we don't think we did right,' that's
very significant.''
   On the lighter side, the 62nd annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade in New York dazzled up to 2 million spectators lining the
parade route plus an estimated 80 million television viewers with 24
floats, 14 marching bands, hundreds of clowns, and the usual giant
balloons of cartoon characters towering five to six stories tall.
   Included in the lineup were new balloons, such as Snoopy's
featured friend, Woodstock, the Pink Panther and Quik Bunny, the
speediest rabbit on the Earth.
   The world's fastest woman, Florence Griffith Joyner, was among
those signed up to join in, along with crooner Frankie Valli, and
the Osmond Boys, sons of the original Osmond Brothers.
   Philadelphia's 69th annual Thanksgiving parade, the nation's
oldest, featured floats and balloons, soap opera stars and Miss
America, Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson.
   In Houston, Foley's 39th annual Thanksgiving Day Parade was
marching into its fourth decade with Alan Thicke of ``Growing
Pains'' serving as commentator.
   In Detroit, about 750,000 spectators were expected to enjoy sunny
skies and temperatures in the mid-40s and low 50s to watch the
city's 2{-hour parade.
   But much of the nation wasn't as lucky when it came to the
weather.
   A Pacific storm left up to 4 feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada,
and West Yellowstone, Mont., had 22 inches of snow as of 7 a.m. Rain
fell along the northern and central West Coast, with snow in the
mountains, and snow fell from the Rockies to the western Dakotas.
One traffic death in Oregon was blamed on icy roads and two people
died in the Los Angeles area when a truck overturned on a wet
highway.
   In Florida, Tropical Storm Keith moved into the Atlantic after
crossing the state, leaving twisted mobile homes and flooded roads
but no major damage or casualties.
   Victims of the weather were among those being helped today.
   In Scott, Ark., grocer Bill Cotham planned to feed 150 people
whose homes were damaged or destroyed in tornadoes last week that
killed six.
   ``Some people are still so in shock about the weather damage, we
just wanted to help them this little bit,'' said Cotham.
   At the Los Angeles Mission, actors Harry Hamlin and Rita Moreno
joined 400 volunteers Wednesday to pass out turkey helpings to the
homeless.
   ``There's no question that we have to all pitch in,'' Hamlin said.
   The area's homeless were offered hotel vouchers through Sunday
night.
   An estimated 18,000 homeless people in Atlanta were expected to
feast on turkey with all the trimmings today in an annual citywide
outpouring of charity.
   In Philadelphia, 25,000 senior citizens and homeless enjoyed
Minnie Moore's annual Thanksgiving dinner Wednesday.
   In Indianapolis, hundreds of volunteers and the hungry planned to
pause today to remember the late Rev. Mozel Sanders, who started
their annual Thanksgiving Dinner Program in 1972.
   In San Antonio, Texas, hundreds of tables were set to feed 13,000
senior citizens expected to enjoy the hospitality at the annual
Jimenez Thanksgiving Dinner.
   On the football fields, the Detroit Lions were playing in their
49th annual Thanksgiving Day game, this year against the Minnesota
Vikings. In the afternoon, the Dallas Cowboys were playing the
Houston Oilers.

<TEXT>
   Algeria, one of four Arab holdouts against
normalizing relations with Egypt, reversed its policy today and
restored diplomatic ties. Official statements issued simultaneously
in Algiers and Cairo said the resumption takes effect immediately
and ambassadors will be nominated ``in the shortest possible time.''
   Algeria and 16 other Arab states severed ties with Cairo after
the Egyptians signed a peace treaty with Israel on March 26, 1979.
Including Algeria, 14 have restored relations, mostly in the past
year.
   The collective boycott of Egypt was part of Arab League sanctions
against Cairo that included suspension of league membership and a
ban on economic aid.
   Only three Arab states _ Sudan, Oman and Somalia _ maintained
diplomatic relations with Egypt. Jordan unilaterally restored ties
in 1985 and Djibouti, also an Arab League member, followed the next
year.
   An Arab summit conference in Amman, Jordan, last November gave
the green light for league members to resume ties with Egypt
individually.
   Algeria's decision brought to 12 the number of countries that
since have restored relations with Egypt. The others are Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Bahrain, North
Yemen, South Yemen, Qatar, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania.
   Only Syria, Libya and Lebanon remain unfriendly to Egypt.
   Radical Syria and Libya, the most hawkish of the Arabs, object to
the Amman summit decision and continue to oppose proposals by
moderates for Egypt's reinstatement to the Arab League.

Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Al Raby, a former aide to the Rev. Martin Luther
King and manager of Harold Washington's 1983 mayoral campaign, has
died of an apparent heart attack. He was 55.
   Raby, like Washington a year ago, died on the eve of Thanksgiving.
   He was pronounced dead Wednesday evening at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital, said hospital spokesman James Henri.
   Raby grew up in poverty on the South Side, dropped out of school
and did not earn his elementary school diploma until he was 24. But
he then continued his education and became an English teacher.
   Raby participated in the civil rights movement during the early
1960s and was a leader in King's open-housing marches in Chicago and
other cities in the urban North.
   ``Al Raby was probably the single biggest reason that Dr. Martin
Luther King came to Chicago,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said. ``Al
helped to lead the open housing movement in the city.''
   In 1977, Raby moved to Washington and became an intergovernmental
liaison in the Carter administration with ACTION, which oversaw the
Peace Corps.
   In 1983 Raby managed Washington's historic campaign in which he
won a three-way Democratic primary and went on to defeat Republican
Bernard Epton to become the city's first black mayor. Raby
subsequently lost the Democratic primary for Washington's 1st
District congressional seat and Washington appointed him director of
the city's Commission on Human Relations.
   ``I'm so deeply saddened,'' said the Rev. Willie Barrow, director
of Operation PUSH, a civil rights group. ``He was really my mentor
in terms of civil rights.''
   ``One year ago the city was in deep grief because of the loss of
our mayor, and now, one year later, a great leader and ambassador of
race relations has left us,'' Ms. Barrow said.
   Raby recently founded a public interest firm, known as the
Haymarket Group.
   He also was a member of a panel of black and Jewish leaders
formed in the wake of strained relations between the groups earlier
this year because of anti-Semitic remarks made by an aide to Mayor
Eugene Sawyer.
   Raby is survived by two daughters, Kathy and Allison, and two
grandchildren.

   Hungary today expelled a Romanian
diplomat in retaliation for Romania's decision to send a Hungarian
commerical counselor home, the official MTI news agency reported.
   Hungary expelled Romanian political counselor Pavel Platona, MTI
said. On Saturday, Romania ordered Hungarian Commercial Counselor
Karoly Gyorfy to leave. The moves further strained the already tense
relations between the two neighboring Warsaw Pact allies.
   A formal Hungarian protest note over the explusion of Gyorfy was
delivered today to the Romanian Embassy in Budapest.
   According to MTI, the note stated that, ``as a response'' to
Gyorfy's expulsion, Platona was declared persona non grata and given
72 hours to leave.
   Last summer Romania expelled the staff of the Hungarian Consulate
at Cluj-Napoca in Transylvania and declared the operation closed
following a demonstration in Budapest by about 50,000 people
protesting Romanian policies.
   Hungarians have expressed anger and concern for the welfare of
1.7 million ethnic Hungarians living in Romania, alleging the
minority suffers discrimination and other hardships.

   Several Jewish leaders who met New Hampshire Gov.
John Sununu said the meeting left them reassured that the future
White House chief of staff is a strong supporter of Israel.
   ``It was a soothing meeting in terms of the anxieties we had
going in,'' Seymour Reich, president of B'nai B'rith International,
said after Wednesday's luncheon attended by about 30 Jewish leaders.
   Last week, several Jewish groups had expressed concern because
Sununu was the only governor in the nation to refuse to sign a
proclamation condemning a 1975 United Nations resolution that
equated Zionism with racism.
   At Wednesday's meeting, Sununu reiterated that he had refused to
sign the proclamation because he felt it was wrong for a governor to
make pronouncements on foreign policy. He also repeated that he
opposed the U.N. resolution.
   Sununu, in an interview published today in The Union Leader of
Manchester, N.H., said he told the Jewish leaders he had thought his
statements against the U.N. resolution were ``equivalent to''
signing a proclamation, and ``Obviously I have learned it wasn't.''
   Sununu said he ``would like to think'' he now has Jewish leaders'
confidence. He said he told them ``if there are issues we have to
talk about, let's get together and talk about them. I assured them
of accessibility.''
   He said he realizes ``it is a very diverse community,'' but ``you
have to come with a perspective that is somewhat unified. Don't
expect me to handle 40 different inputs and in a Solomon-like way
identify what the consensus ought to be.''
   The host of the luncheon, Jacob Stein, said Sununu also said he
was committed to ``the integrity and security of the state of
Israel.''
   Sununu assured the Jewish leaders that the Bush administration
will follow the lead of previous administrations and assign a
liaison to the Jewish community, Stein said.
   ``The governor's point of view ... was received well,'' said
Stein, a special adviser to President Reagan and leader of the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations from
1971 to 1973.
   ``His explanations satisfied the group,'' said Theodore Ellenoff,
president of the American Jewish Committee. ``There was a measurably
higher comfort level achieved at the meeting.''
   Peter Teeley, a spokesman for Sununu, said in Washington on
Wednesday that the meeting went well.
   He added that the subject of Sununu's ethnic background _ he is
of Lebanese descent on his father's side _ was raised but dismissed
as a ``non-issue.''

<HEAD>Uranium Plant May Lay Off 300 Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drop in demand for radioactive material could
mean that about 300 unionized employees at the Fernald uranium
processing plant will lose their jobs after their 7-week-old strike
is resolved.
   ``In the next couple of years, we could almost go to zero
production,'' Bruce Boswell, president of Westinghouse Materials Co.
of Ohio, said Wednesday. The company operates the plant for the U.S.
Department of Energy.
   The amount of uranium processed at the plant dropped from 8,250
tons last year to about 1,110 tons this year, he said. Production
should continue at the decreased level for at least several years,
Boswell said.
   The exact number of layoffs has not been determined, but a figure
of 300 ``is not unreasonable,'' he said.
   The layoffs could affect some of the 625 workers represented by
the Atomic Trades Labor Council who went on strike Oct. 7. Non-union
employees also would be affected, plant officials said.
   The plant 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati is officially known as
the Feed Materials Production Center and employs about 1,500 people.
It processes uranium, some of which is molded into ingots and bars
that are used to fuel Energy Department reactors in other states.
The plant also produces uranium for nuclear weapons.
   Layoffs began with 50 workers last March after the department
closed the plant's chief customer, the Hanford nuclear reactor in
Washington state.
   The plant has been shifting from production to cleanup. Boswell
said environmental repairs will continue at the plant even if it
never processes uranium again.
   The plant has been criticized in recent years for having emitted
thousands of pounds of radioactive dust into the air, the ground,
and underground water. The state of Ohio and the plant's neighbors
have separate U.S. District Court lawsuits pending which allege that
the plant has contaminated its environment and endangered residents'
health.

<HEAD>Turning Radioactive Waste Into Glass Is Joe Mellen's Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disposing of accumulated radioactive waste in
the U.S. nuclear weapons complex, and making the plants safe, is a
job that will cost up to $110 billion, and is one that Joe Mellen
doesn't take lightly.
   Mellen is technical supervisor at the Defense Waste Processing
Facility, a $1.3 billion project designed to make glass out of what
he calls the ``hottest stuff,'' high-level radioactive waste stored
on the 300-square-mile Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.
   Once the plant is fully operational in 1992, it ``will take 12
years to catch up'' and dispose of the 33 million gallons of
radioactive waste that has built up at Savannah River since its
reactors began operation in 1954. It will take 600 people and $60
million a year to operate.
   Similar glass techniques have been tried out in France, Britain,
Japan and West Germany, and if they work at Savannah River, they
will be used to dispose of an even greater backlog of nuclear waste
at the Hanford Site, near Richland, Wash., said Mellen.
   The Energy Department, which runs the complex, decided to try it
first in South Carolina, said Mellen, because ``if there were a
catastrophic accident at Savannah River, such as an earthquake,
radioactive contaminants might reach the water table and possibly
the river itself,'' alongside the plant.
   Hanford is in an arid environment, so the danger is not thought
as acute.
   Turning the waste into glass, rather than allowing it to sit in
metal tanks, will provide a wide margin of safety, said Mellen,
because ``if someone blew up a glass canister house, we would have a
containment and cleanup problem'' but face little danger of
contamination entering the air and water supply. The glass is
virtually insoluble.
   Mellen, wearing a business suit and a white construction hat,
twisted and ducked as he led visitors through chambers that will be
closed to humans after operations begin.
   ``These doors are labyrinthine to keep the telephone poles out in
a tornado,'' he said. The building contains 10,000 tons of
reinforced steel, protection against earthquakes.
   ``When most of these buildings were built, no one was even
thinking about earthquakes,'' said Mellen. The waste tanks, which
require a crew of 200, ``were not designed to the same earthquake
standard that we use now.''
   Flying buttresses and other seismic insurance have been added to
Savannah River's three operational reactors, which started running
in 1954. They have been closed down for safety concerns and the
first is not expected to return to production until early next year.
The department expects to complete a new generation production
reactor at the plant by the turn of the century.
   The massive concrete waste processing facility, 360-feet long,
100 feet high and 117 feet wide, contains an inner ``canyon,'' where
all the radioactive waste will be processed behind four-foot thick
walls.
   The heart of the operation is a melter, costing $19 million. The
processed waste, rich in highly dangerous cesium, will be mixed with
a fine sand called borosilicate ``frit,'' and heated to 2,100
degrees Fahrenheit inside stainless steel canisters 10-feet tall and
two-feet in diameter.
   The canisters, untouched by humans, will be moved through tunnels
to a device which uses 75,000 pounds of pressure and an electric
charge of 240,000 amps to weld in a steel cap that is slightly wider
than the container neck.
   ``They weld cable-car rails together like this in San
Francisco,'' said Mellen.
   The plant can process 1\ canisters a day, and each will be moved
separately by a vehicle weighing 255,000 pounds to an adjacent
warehouse able to store 2,286 canisters temporarily.
   Because a permanent underground repository will not be ready
before the year 2003, at a geologically stable site in the West,
authorities must build another warehouse. Each canister is expected
to generate the heat of a 470-watt light bulb, and the building is
designed in such a way that air will flow over them and cool them.
   In 1990, said Mellen, ``we will begin simulating a cold run,
using a non-radioactive stand-in for the chemicals. It is going to
take us 19 months to prove to ourselves that we are ready to go
radioactive.''
   ``Experience has taught us that caution is the way to go,'' he
said.
   The facility will process only about 1 percent of the radioactive
waste, ``the hottest stuff,'' giving off gamma rays. Lower level
radioactive waste, which do not emit such lethal rays, are buried in
carefully monitored yards.
   Radioactive contamination is a problem at most of the 17 major
plants in the nuclear weapons complex. The worst is at Hanford,
where atomic reactors secretly manufactured material for the bombs
during World War II.
   Hanford stores 37 million gallons of radioactive wastes.
According to an Energy Department report last July, environmental,
safety and health costs at Hanford will run to $633.2 million
through 1995 and up to $46 billion over 50 years, almost half of the
total for the entire nuclear weapons complex.
   Cleaning up contamination at Savannah River Plant could cost $3.7
billion through 1995 and up to $8.8 billion more through 2010, said
the report.
   Another highly publicized problem exists at the Rocky Flats Plant
near Denver. Low-level wastes, such as gloves and rags, had been
shipped from Rocky Flats to another federal facility at Idaho Falls,
Idaho, until Idaho governor Cecil Andrus closed state borders to the
shipments in October.
   Since then, seven steel-lined rail cars carrying 140 drums with
55 gallons of waste each have been parked at Rocky Flats.
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer has threatened to close the plant until
federal officials find a solution.
   The material was earmarked for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant
near Carlsbad, N. M., but that has not opened because Congress
adjourned this fall before formally ceding it from the Bureau of
Land Management to the Energy Department. Department officials say
they do not want to store radioactive wastes at the site until they
actually have the deed.

<TEXT>
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Claiborne Pell flew to Cuba Thursday for talks with President Fidel
Castro on the possibility of a friendlier U.S. relationship with the
island.
   ``There is an old saying that if something works, leave it
alone,'' Pell said through a spokesman before departing. ``The
policy toward Cuba is not working so it may be time to change it.''
   The Rhode Island Democrat said the United States has ``embargoed,
blockaded and invaded Cuba'' but the policies have not produced the
desired result.
   In addition to meeting with Castro, Pell plans during his
four-day stay to confer with church leaders and other private
citizens. He also will visit areas outside Havana.
   U.S. relations with Cuba have been unusually hostile during the
most of the Reagan administration, but the two countries have
demonstrated an ability to work constructively on a narrow range of
issues over the past year.
   In November 1987, Washington and Havana revived an immigration
agreement that Cuba had suspended in May 1985 in protest over the
start of Radio Marti, a Voice of America station aimed at Cuban
listeners.
   In addition, a U.S.-mediated negotiation produced a breakthrough
this week that will lead to the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops
from Angola. The presence of Cuban forces in Angola since 1975 has
been a sore point in Cuban-American relations.
   According to Pell's spokesman, Frank Sieverts, the senator
believes the time for a policy review is ripe because of the change
in administrations in Washington and troop withdrawal agreement.
   Pell visited Cuba as senator-elect in 1960, about two months
after the United States imposed an economic embargo against Cuba and
a month before the Eisenhower administration broke relations with
the island.
   Afterward, no member of Congress visited Cuba until 1974 when
Pell and the late Sen. Jacob Javits, R-N.Y., traveled there in
September of that year.
   Three years later, the United States and Cuba resumed limited
diplomatic contact with the opening of small official missions in
each other's capital.
   The Reagan administration has shown no interest in addressing the
principal problems blocking the way of a more normal relationship.
   In response to Cuban support for Nicaragua's leftist government
and for leftist rebels elsewhere in the hemisphere, the
administration has tightened the economic embargo against Cuba and
forbids most Americans from traveling to Cuba under the Trading with
the Enemy Act.
   Sieverts said it would be premature to say whether Pell, after
his return next Monday, will introduce legislation to ease the
embargo against Cuba. Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., initially had
intended to accompany Pell but decided not to go.
   Pell, who was briefed by administration officials prior to his
departure, is making the trip about two weeks before the Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev will visit the island for the first time
since he assumed power 3{ years ago.
   In early January, Castro will celebrate the 30th anniversary of
the triumph of his revolution.

<HEAD>Study Makes Suggestions For Raising Money For Nonprofit Causes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The homeless, the environment and other
nonprofit causes could raise some $70 million a year if the United
States allowed sale of postage stamps that carry the mail, a message
and a higher price, according to a report released Thursday.
   The postage-stamp suggestion was one of five proposals in a study
of ways nonprofit organizations could find new ways to raise money
as government aid shrinks and private donations level off. The five
suggestions could raise as much as $6 billion, the report said.
   The surcharge on the postage stamps would be given to the
selected organizations sponsoring the stamps once the cost of
printing and distribution had been deducted, the report said.
   For example, a 25-cent stamp dedicated to the homeless might
actually sell for 35 cents, with most of the extra dime going to
homeless causes.
   The study was conducted by the Institute for Public Policy and
Administration of the Union for Experimenting Colleges and
Universities.
   ``These ideas should not be considered a substitution for
traditional sources of revenue,'' wrote Mark Rosenman, director of
the institute. ``In particular, government and charitable support
must increase for (nonprofit organizations) to thrive.''
   However, Rosenman said federal programs providing money for
nonprofit organizations have had $70 billion in funding cuts from
1980 to 1986.
   The cause-related postage stamps are used in several European
countries, and Canada used a similar system for two years for raise
money for the 1976 Olympics, the report said. West Germany raised
some $20 million in 1986 on sales of stamps supporting youth causes.
   The U.S. Postal Service already allows commercial advertising in
conjunction with the sale of stamps in an effort to maximize its own
operating revenue. In those cases, the advertiser pays the postal
service a fee in return for being allowed to place its message on
stamp booklets sold at supermarkets and other outlets.
   The other proposals included setting up special taxing districts
that could raise up to $1 billion annually; changing tax laws to
encourage businesses to donate goods, money or technical help; using
bond reserves, the funds set aside to insure against potential
losses, to finance community development; setting up special
districts to levy taxes for specific purposes; establishing
statewide associations to negotiate discounts for group buying.
   In all, the institute considered some three dozen suggestions for
new ways nonprofit organizations can raise money. Some of those
included using credit cards to make monthly payments on pledges to
nonprofit organizations, providing a checkoff on income tax forms
allowing taxpayers to designate a set amount for a specific purpose,
having the organizations charge for their services, and setting up a
nonprofit news service to cover ``important events and activities
... which might not otherwise be covered by the commercial press
services.''

   A new family code made public Thursday
will ban polygamy, limit prices men pay for brides, and eliminate
alimony because it is ``unknown by African traditions.''
   The code to take effect in January 1991 seeks to remove ``written
colonial law'' from family life and return to ancient customs.
   The laws, published Thursday by the official Zaire news agency
AZAP, ban ``treatments and rites incompatible with human dignity and
with the respect due to individual freedom.'' Under tribal law a
widow is often married against her will to a member of the dead
husband's family.
   Violations are sanctioned by ancient tribal penalties, such as
payment of damages in the form of goats, chickens or the ``ancestral
wine,'' the code said.
   The maximum price men pay for their wives is ``fixed for each
region by presidential order,'' it said.

<HEAD>State's Hazwaste Fine Against Navy Upheld</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine's authority to fine the Navy up to
$25,000 a day for violating state hazardous waste regulations at a
nuclear submarine overhaul base has been upheld by a federal judge.
   Maine and several other states that have been trying to force the
federal government to abide by their hazardous waste laws had
awaited U.S. District Judge Gene Carter's decision for a year.
   Maine Attorney General James E. Tierney, who filed the state's
lawsuit seeking a cleanup and fines against the Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard in Kittery, could not be reached by telephone on Thursday.
   But Deputy Attorney General Philip Ahrens said he hopes Carter's
decision Wednesday sets a pattern for rulings in similar cases in
other parts of the country.
   ``We believe that the federal government, which has some of the
worst hazardous waste sites, should be subject to the same laws as
everyone else is,'' said Ahrens.
   It was not immediately known whether the Navy would appeal
Carter's decision to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Boston. Justice Department attorney Mary Elizabeth Ward, who handled
the case for the Navy, could not be reached through the Kittery
facility, where phones were answered by a taped message.
   Tierney filed two lawsuits in 1986 asking that the southern Maine
shipyard be required to clean up inactive solid-waste and
hazardous-waste dumps, including a landfill and mercury disposal
areas.
   ``The shipyard needs outside pressure,'' Tierney said at the
time, adding that the Environmental Protection Agency did not have
enough influence ``to push the Pentagon around.''
   The Navy claimed that it could not be forced to pay civil
penalties even if it violated Maine laws, and that Maine's annual
fees levied against all hazardous waste generators were an
unconstitutional tax on the federal government.
   In November 1987, then-U.S. Magistrate D. Brock Hornby
recommended that federal facilities not be exempted from state
environmental regulations. Several states joined Maine in asking
Carter to uphold Hornby's findings.
   On Wednesday, Carter declared he ``wholeheartedly concurs'' with
Hornby's conclusion that the federal Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act allows the recovery of civil penalties by a state
agency against the federal government.
   Quoting from Hornby's conclusion, Carter said that federal
facilities ``will be treated the same as private institutions so far
as enforcement of the solid waste and hazardous waste laws are
concerned.''
   Carter also ruled that the state can require the shipyard to
contribute to a state fund used to administer the state's
hazardous-waste program.
   ``The fees apply to other hazardous water licensees and
generators, and it is clear that the intent of (the federal law) is
to have federal facilities treated in the same manner `as any
person,''' Carter said.
   On the issue of civil penalties, Carter agreed with Hornby that
Congress waived sovereign immunity, a legal doctrine that shields
the government from most lawsuits, when it passed the RCRA in 1976.
RCRA subjects federal facilities to state hazardous waste laws.

Transport Ministry said.
   A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
fog reduced visibility at the airport to less than 200 yards and the
runway was closed for 3{ hours.
   Thirteen planes, including six airliners from other countries,
were diverted to Tokyo's Haneda airport and Nagoya in central Japan.
   Some plane departures were delayed nearly two hours, he said.
   About 300 planes take off and land daily at the Narita airport,
40 miles northeast of Tokyo, the official said.
   Fog forces the airport to close briefly several times each year.

   The health of Switzerland's forests
improved this year for the first time since 1983 as the overall
share of damaged trees fell from 56 percent to 43 percent, a
government survey said Thursday.
   It expressed concern, however, that trees in alpine regions,
mostly evergreens, showed only slight improvement and more than half
remain damaged.
   In keeping with trends toward improvement in neighboring West
Germany and Austria, the proportion of damaged trees in Switzerland
has receded to 1986 levels, the annual report said.
   Rodolphe Schlaepfer, the top Swiss forestry official, suggested
earlier fears about a catastrophic ``dying of forests'' were
exaggerated.
   Favorable weather and a drop in pollution, particularly that
caused by ozone, were major factors in the improvement over last
year, said the nationwide survey of 8,000 trees.
   Leafy trees showed sharply improved health in most areas, it said.

   A U.S. ammunition depot from the Vietnam
War exloded at an airport in Ho Chi Minh City but caused only minor
damage, according to a Vietnamese newspaper.
   The depot near Tan Son Nhut airport, which contained 81mm mortar
and 20mm cannon shells, blew up Oct. 24, the Giai Phong newspaper
reported.
   Explosions lasting about an hour caused ``insignificant'' damage
since the depot was surrounded by high earth embankments separating
it from nearby barracks and a residental area, the newspaper said.
   The blast may have been triggered by igniting of the old,
discarded ammunition and gunpowder, but an investigation was
continuing, the newspaper said.
   Tan Son Nhut was a major U.S. airbase during the war, which ended
when communist forces took Saigon, later renamed Ho Chi Minh City,
in 1975. The victors captured military equipment supplied to South
Vietnams by the United States.

   Torrential rains caused flooding
and triggered landslides in southeast Asia, killing at least 49
people and forcing tens of thousands from their homes, officials
said Thursday.
   Floodwaters washed out thousands of roads, cut off rail service
and destroyed crops in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, where heavy
rain fell between Saturday and Wednesday.
   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Thursday toured
areas of the east coast where 25 people died. The Bernama news
agency reported Mahathir viewed the flooding from an air force plane
but gave no other details.
   The agency said the situation was improving in the six states hit
by torrential rains and flooding since Monday. It said 47,000 people
remained in evacuation centers Thursday, down from 60,000 Wednesday.
   Roads in some parts of the affected states were becoming
passable. But flooding in southern Thailand still prevented rail
service between Bangkok, the Thai capital, and Butterworth, 180
miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, said Zainal Abidin Abdul Talib,
spokesman for the Malayan Railway system in Kuala Lumpur.
   Four days of storms and monsoon flooding in southern Thailand
killed 22 people and damaged nearly a thousand roads, Thai
government officials said.
   The storms destroyed 218 bridges and 67 dikes and irrigation
works in 11 provinces of the southern peninsula, according to
officials of the Interior Ministry and Meteorological Bureau.
   More than 120,000 acres of farmland were reported under water.
   A local newspaper quoted Lt. Gen. Kitti Rattanachaya, deputy
commander of the Fourth Army Region, as troops have been dispatched
to evacuate villagers isolated by floods.
   The English-language Nation also reported the Thai air force took
supplies to flood-hit areas, and the government has allocated $1.4
million for relief operations.
   In Indonesia, floods and landslides killed two people and left
two others missing in west Sumatra, the Social Affairs Ministry said.
   Heavy rain caused a number of rivers in the province to overflow
their banks, destroying about 4,000 acres of crops and scores of
homes, the ministry said.
   A landslide Wednesday buried four people alive in the district of
Agam, 750 miles northwest of Jakarta, it said.
   Two bodies have been recovered, but the search continued for the
other two, it added.
   The ministry said it expected more reports from districts where
landslides have blocked roads and disrupted communications.
   Major floods, triggered by heavy rain, hit two other areas
earlier this month leaving 28 people dead in south Tapanuli, about
940 miles northwest of Jakarta, and more than 20 others on the
island of Flores, about 1,250 miles southeast of Jakarta.

   In upholding the conviction of Michael Bisnett on
weapon-possession and cocaine-trafficking charges, the Brooklyn
Appellate Division unanimously agreed Tuesday that the disorder _
obstructive sleep apnea _ is not a ``mental disease or defect.''
   ``Bisnett kept snoring during his trial and the judge asked his
attorney to jab him in the stomach to keep him awake,'' Kunstler
said in Thursday's New York Post. ``When his defense attorney said
this might cause Bisnett a heart attack, the judge said, `Please,
let him sleep.'''
   Bisnett, a former locksmith, is serving a 23 years to life
sentence in Attica state prison for his May 14, 1986 conviction.
   He claimed the disorder left him powerless to assist in his
defense.
   Brooklyn state Supreme Court Justice Herbert Kramer denied
Bisnett's demand for a mistrial because no one indicated before
proceedings began that Bisnett was incapable of standing trial.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo on Thursday
expressed sorrow for his friend and disgraced predecessor Chun
Doo-hwan and appeared to come a step closer to pardoning him.
   The president also hinted he would reorganize his government soon
to break a prolonged political standoff.
   ``Enough has been done,'' Roh told a group of ruling party
officials. ``As a long friend, I felt deep sorrow for the former
president, who had to leave in such a way.
   ``Any legal action against him is not only undesirable but also
against the repeated promise by all opposition leaders objecting to
political reprisals,'' he said.
   Roh said it was time to close the case, because the nation must
have learned a lesson from the crisis.
   Government officials said Roh was expected to appear on national
TV Friday night to appeal to the nation to forgive Chun.
   Roh also indicated he would carry out an extensive government
reorganization, saying: ``No persons, who adhere to the past way of
thinking, would be needed in the new era. A grand save-the-nation
march has begun.''
   The leading national newspaper, Hankook Ilbo, said Roh was
expected to shake up his Cabinet and ruling Democratic Justice Party
extensively next month.
   In his speech Friday, Roh also is expected to promise speedier
democratic reforms and announce specific measures to heal political
wounds left over from the Chun era, officials said.
   The measures would include the reinstatement of thousands of
illegally purged government officials and hefty financial
compensation for the victims of a bloody 1980 civil uprising in the
southern city of Kwangju, they said. By official count, the military
killed some 200 people Kwangju.
   Roh and Chun, both retired generals, have been friends since they
were classmates at Korea Military Academy in the early 1950's. Roh
succeeded Chun when he stepped down at the end of a seven-year term
in February.
   Chun, under attack for corruption and human rights abuses,
apologized to the nation Wednesday and left Seoul to live in
seclusion in the countryside in a traditional Korean form of
repentance for disgraced leaders.
   The ex-president and his wife, Lee Soon-ja, spent his first day
in rural exile at a remote 14th-century Buddhist temple in the
mountainous eastern area.
   In a nationally televised speech before going into rural exile,
Chun admitted his involvement in corruption and the abuse of power
and said he would surrender all his property, worth $24 million.
   Roh and other government officials maintain Chun's apology and
subsequent rural exile were enough to resolve the raging
controversy, but the opposition argues the actions were far from
enough.
   Many opposition and dissident groups said they would continue to
press for Chun to appear before parliamentary committees to testify
on some of his past major political mistakes, including the brutal
military suppression of the Kwangju uprising.
   On Thursday, about 200 radical students and dissidents staged an
outdoor protest at Seoul's Myungdong Cathedral, demanding Chun be
arrested and punished on corruption charges. Police stayed away
during the protest, which lasted several hours.
   Also Thursday, police stopped 12 Buddhist activists who were
trying to go by car to the temple where Chun is staying. The Buddist
monks reportedly told police they could not tolerate the presence of
a disgraced person such as Chun at a sacred temple.
   Dong-a Ilbo, a leading newspaper, said an informal phone survey
of 1,600 South Koreans in six cities indicated at least 50 percent
thought Chun's apology was insufficient, while 44 percent said the
statement was acceptable.
   Of those questioned, some 38 percent called for a major
parliamentary investigation into Chun's government, the paper said.

   Willie Parks didn't even last until his first
lunch hour in his new job as a typist at the Hennepin County
probation office.
   He had just finished orientation and was at his desk Monday when
he was spotted by his own probation officer, Jack Hughes, who a
couple of months earlier had drafted an arrest warrant for Parks.
   Hugh said Parks had failed to make restitution to a bank he had
robbed and had failed to keep in touch.
   Astonished to discover his errant client working a mere 20 feet
from his own desk, Hughes simply asked Parks how he was doing. ``His
response was, `Well I'm doing fine, Jack. How are you?''' Hughes
said.
   ``He was with great calm and I was relatively amazed, and we just
went about our respective duties.''
   While Parks sat typing a letter, Hughes informed David Gair,
manager of the felony probations division, that he'd hired a felon.
Then he asked a deputy sheriff to come over and arrest his client.
   As the deputy was leading Parks out the door in handcuffs, Hughes
told him he would set a court date for a revocation of probation
hearing and see him in court with his attorney. ``His response to me
was, `Is this going to screw up my employment?''' Hughes said.
   When Parks applied for the $7.02 an hour job, he didn't mention
that he had been convicted of robbing a local bank on Dec. 15, 1986.
   One of the conditions of Parks' three-year probation was that he
repay the $300 he stole. After he was released from the workhouse,
where he served four months, Parks had made two payments, totaling
$115. But he hadn't made any payments since January or contacted his
restitution officer, Hughes said.
   Because the office was in urgent need of typists, Park was hired
before a background check could be done _ something that Gair said
won't happen again.
   ``It was embarrassing,'' Gair said.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of people converged
on the sacred lake of Pushkar this week _ as they do every November
when the full moon heralds the coming of winter _ to buy and sell
camels and celebrate the renewal of life.
   The rigors of their desert life are pushed aside for a week as
they watch the dances of gypsy women and listen to ballads sung by
transvestite performers.
   Most of the day is spent feeding, grooming and haggling over
prices of one-hump camels, but the Hindu faithful make their way to
the lake to bathe in the waters which tradition says spouted from
the desert when Lord Brahman dropped a lotus from his hand.
   Married women unwrap their saris to bare their breasts and dip
them in the lake, believing this will cause them to give birth to
more sons. Maimed beggars make their way to the lake seeking alms,
food and spiritual salvation.
   The rituals peaked with the appearance of the full moon
Wednesday, the 11th day of the Hindu month of Kartik and the day
Hindu traditions say Lord Brahma dropped his lotus. Brahma, foremost
in the Hindu trinity of gods, is reverered as the creator of the
universe.
   Pushkar, with a population of about 9,000, holds more than 400
temples where long-tailed gray monkeys with black faces swing from
dome to dome.
   About 300,000 villagers, most from Pushkar's Rajasthan state, and
more than 50,000 camels and cattle have gathered for the annual
festival.
   About 7,000 foreign tourists, mostly from North America and
Western Europe, joined the celebration this year, according to
R.V.S. Bhanwar, general manager of the Rajasthan tourist company.
   A city of colorful striped tents has sprung up to house the more
affluent visitors, who pay about $50 a night for an individual tent
and meals.
   For the foreigners, the biggest attractions are the chances to
ride camels and elephants and to watch the camel races.
   But livestock sales, along with the religious experience, are the
chief draws for Indian participants.
   The drought that had ravaged the desert state of Rajasthan eased
this year when the monsoon arrived after a three-year absence. This
meant the livestock sellers were more interested in getting good
prices, instead of getting rid of beasts they could not afford to
feed.
   A strong camel is fetching as much as $135 to $200 this year.

<HEAD>California Man Hams It Up With Soviet Cosmonaut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ham radio operator who for years has
escaped the confines of a wheelchair and one-room trailer home by
taking electronic journeys has winged into a Soviet space station on
his call letters.
   Gordon Gunnels, 37, a former firefighter who has lost most of his
sight and muscle coordination to multiple sclerosis, spoke over his
radio Nov. 17 with one of the Soviet cosmonauts in the space station
Mir.
   The cosmonaut was Col. Vladimir Titov, the station's commander,
who goes by the amateur radio operator's call number U1MIR. Titov
and Musa Manarov on July 12 set the record for space endurance after
orbiting since Dec. 21.
   ``His English was better than mine,'' said Gunnels. ``He asked me
where I lived and told me I was sounding very strong. It was so
clear it was like he was hovering right over my trailer.''
   Then they had a ``good chuckle'' over Gunnels' call sign, KB6BUN.
``I told him it fit me perfectly because I'm in a wheelchair and
always sitting on my buns. And that was about it for the
conversation,'' Gunnels said.
   Titov and Manarov started hamming it up with earthbound radio
operators nearly two weeks ago, said Dave Sumner, executive vice
president of the Connecticut-based American Radio Relay League, an
organization of about 155,000 amateur radio enthusiasts.
   The league has gotten reports of radio contact with the space
station from operators around the world in what is the first such
communication with the Soviets. U.S. astronauts on several space
shuttle flights have talked to hams.
   ``We are very excited about it,'' Sumner said.
   Southern California league members say they believe Gunnels is
the first West Coast operator to contact the space station.
   Gunnels, who lives with a nurse attendant, said he took up the
ham radio hobby ``out of desperation'' about seven years ago and now
spends as much as eight hours a day on the radio.
   As exciting as the chat with the cosmonaut was, Gunnels said it
was only the second-most thrilling contact he has made over the
radio.
   The most exciting was when an operator made an emergency request
asking how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation on an accident
victim, he said.
   ``I called the paramedics and then told the man how to do CPR.
The guy who was hurt pulled through and later even came to thank me
in person. He wanted to give me $500, but I told him to use it for
his kids' college fund,'' said Gunnels. ``I don't do this sort of
thing for money. Ham radio keeps me alive. It has kept me going.''

<HEAD>26 Killed in Two Massacres</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attackers killed 26 civilians in two
separate massacres, slaying a sleeping family of nine and spraying
automatic gunfire into a packed chapel, the military and survivors
said Thursday.
   Reports reaching Manila said 18 communist or Moslem rebels and 13
troops or militiamen were slain in the past three days in clashes
around the country.
   Military officials blamed communist rebels for Tuesday's chapel
massacre on Cebu island that left 17 dead and at least 12 wounded.
But a wealthy landowner who survived the attack said she believed
she was the target because of a dispute with neighbors.
   In the Zamboanga del Sur province on Mindanao island, the
military said machete-wielding attackers massacred a farmer, his
wife and seven children Tuesday as they slept in their home.
   The attackers, armed with machetes and knives, entered the house
of farner Patricio Laranjo in the Mindanao town of Midsalip and
hacked Laranjo, his wife and seven children to death, the military
said.
   Two other children survived the attack by hiding under the bodies
of their slain kin, the military said. The attack was an apparent
robbery because the killers fled with the victims' savings and other
belongings, it said.
   In the chapel massacre, the dead included four children and two
elderly women, officials and survivors said. A hospital spokesman
said three of the wounded were in critical condition.
   Survivors said the gunmen, some wearing fatigues, arrived Tuesday
evening in Bagtik, about 340 miles southeast of Manila.
   The gunmen sprayed gunfire around the chapel and the adjacent
residence of landowner Cresencia Hermosilia, the chapel's owner,
survivors told The Associated Press in telephone interviews from a
hospital in Cebu City.
   The village is in an isolated mountain area, at least a two-hour
hike to the nearest road and about 50 miles from the provincial
capital on rugged roads. Word of the massacre reached authorities
Thursday when the survivors arrived at the hospital.
   Lolita Gitgit, 28, said villagers were praying the rosary in the
chapel when dogs outside began to bark. Several men left the service
and tried to drive away the gunmen with stones but ``they were all
mowed down,'' she said.
   ``There were many of them,'' said farmer Jose Canelio, 27. ``The
shooting continued for a long time, maybe 20 minutes. When the
shooting ended and we got up, they were gone. Many of us were dead.
There was much moaning.''
   Canelio said that when the dogs barked, he rushed out to
investigate and saw two men climbing the balcony of Mrs.
Hermosilia's two-story house. He said he and other villagers tried
to drive the intruders away with stones, ``and the shooting suddenly
began.''
   The regional military commander, Brig. Gen. Jesus Hermosa,
visited the site Thursday and told reporters that communist New
People's Army guerrillas were behind the massacre.
   The rebels attacked because the villagers had refused to pay
``revolutionary taxes,'' Hermosa said. ``They view (the villagers)
as a threat to them. They had been resisting the NPA.''
   But Roldan Mangubat, a member of the provincial advisory board,
quoted Mrs. Hermosilia as saying she did not believe the attackers
were communist rebels. He quoted her as saying they could be
``jealous neighbors'' who accused her of using religion as a ``front
for making money.''
   Villagers and relatives of Mrs. Hermosilia said she built the
chapel and began sponsoring regular devotions to the Virgin Mary
more than 10 years ago in fulfillment of a vow after her daughter
recovered from a serious illness.
   Mangubat said Mrs. Hermosilia had received a death threat from an
unidentified group not to proceed with a religious celebration a day
before the attack. The group claimed the celebration was too
extravagant.
   A military officer who demanded anonymity said investigators did
not believe the attackers were rebels and were looking for an
unidentified nephew of Mrs. Hermosilia. He did not elaborate or say
why other military officials insisted on blaming the rebels.

<TEXT>
   Herbert W. Alexander, retired publisher and
editor in chief of Pocket Books, has died at the age of 78.
   ``Under his editorship, Pocket Books maintained its position as
the largest mass-market paperback publisher despite the entrance of
seven other aggressive companies into the field,'' said Lawrence
Hughes, chairman of the Hearst Trade Book Group.
   Alexander, who retired on Jan. 1, 1974, also was a director and
vice president of Simon & Schuster, which has owned Pocket Books
since the late 1950's.
   He built a strong list of mysteries by acquiring reprints of
books by Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, Ellery Queen, Dashiell
Hammett and others. In 1950, he purchased Nelson Algren's ``Man With
the Golden Arm'' for $25,000, a record reprint price at the time. He
also acquired ``The Winds of War'' and ``War and Remembrance'' by
Herman Wouk.
   After Pocket Books acquired rights to Harold Robbins, it
established Trident Press in 1961 to publish his novels in hard
cover. Alexander became president of Trident, as well as editor of a
number of Robbins' books, including ``The Carpetbaggers.''
   Alexander died Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He is survived
by a son, Thomas P. Alexander of Manhattan.

   An army helicopter on Thursday
rescued 27 crewmen from a Greek freighter that sprang a leak and was
in danger of sinking in rough seas and heavy winds off the coast of
Nova Scotia.
   Rescuers aboard the helicopter used a rope and harness to lift
the men from the deck of the 375-foot Katia to a nearby bulk
carrier, the Sankomoon, according to a spokesman for the Halifax
Search and Rescue Coordination Center.
   ``Nobody injured,'' said the skipper of the Sankomoon in a
ship-to-shore interview. ``Nobody hurt. Nobody sick. Everybody
healthy.''
   S.K. Saggi, the first engineer of the Katia and one of the first
to be rescued, said 20-foot-waves caused his ship to develop a leak.
   ``We had a leak into No. 1 hold and we could not pump it out,''
Saggi said, also in a ship-to-shore interview. ``The ship started
taking list on the portside (left).''
   ``We didn't think we'd make it,'' Saggi said.
   The Katia, a 5,000-ton freighter registered in Liberia, sent out
a distress call shortly after midnight about 225 miles southeast of
Nova Scotia's southern tip. The crew reported it could not cope with
the intake of water.
   The Katia is owned by Seatriumph Marine Corp. of Piraeus, Greece.
In an interview from Piraeus, a spokesman for the company said the
crew was from the Philippines and the officers were East Indian.
   The Katia was on its way to Halifax to refuel before heading to
Quebec with a load of twine.
   The Sankomoon had been headed to Turkey when it stopped to rescue
the freighter's crew. The Canadian Coast Guard ship Alert, the
Cormorant and the research ship Quest also were in the area.

   A jury has awarded $125,000 to a teen-ager who
was strip-searched when school officials suspected her of carrying
marijuana.
   Kim Stevens, now 19, was a 15-year-old senior at Herbert Lehman
High School in the Bronx when the search occurred on Oct. 18, 1984.
   ``The testimony was that she was seen by school personnel in
possession of a small manila envelope of the type that they had
known to contain marijuana,'' said Ellen Zincke, a city attorney.
   ``They told me if I didn't drop my pants, they'd take me down to
the police station and men would search me,'' Stevens said.
   Both sides agreed that no marijuana or other narcotic was found
on Stevens.
   Another attorney with the city corporation counsel's office, Len
Olarsch, said the city would move to have Wednesday's verdict set
aside or reduced before pursuing an appeal.

   Border patrol police armed with M-16
rifles raided a heroin refinery near the Thai-Burmese border and
seized 198 pounds of the drug after a gunbattle, a senior police
officer said Thursday.
   Police Maj. Gen. Kovit Wattana said 20 guards at the refinery
opened fire as about 40 policemen prepared to attack Wednesday.
After a 15-minute shoot-out, the tribesmen from the minority Haw
hill tribe retreated into the surrounding jungle in northern
Thailand. Wattana did not mention any casualties.
   The attack occurred in Prao district of Chiangmai province, 430
miles north of Bangkok.
   The heroin is worth $1.5 million to $1.9 million on the local
market, he said. Police also found chemicals used in heroin
production.
   An official of the Thai Narcotics Control Board said they
estimate 700-800 tons of opium will come this year from the ``Golden
Triangle,'' a swath of territory in Burma, Thailand and Laos.
   It is one of the world's prime sources of illicit opium, from
which heroin is refined and smuggled to other Asian countries, the
United States and Western Europe.

   Dutch sailors rescued an Indonesian
fisherman and his three sons who were floating in the Malacca Strait
for about 12 hours, the Netherlands Embassy said Thursday.
   The royal Dutch navy's HMS Witte de With was on its way from
Australia to the Netherlands when it found the four in the sea
Tuesday after their fishing boat sank, the embassy said.
   It said three of the four were in good condition; the fourth was
suffering from exhaustion. It did not specify who was suffering from
exhaustion.
   They were dropped off at Sigli port in north Sumatra on Wednesday.
   Ali Putie, and his sons Ramuli, 22; Murmaban, 19; and Umar, 16,

   An exhausted Emperor Hirohito slept most of the day
Thursday after suffering more bleeding episodes during the night,
palace officials said.
   The bleeding was the first sign of internal hemorrhaging by the
87-year-old monarch in more than two weeks Hirohito.
   ``The emperor wasn't able to rest during the night because of the
repeated discharges, so he slept most of the day,'' a palace
official said.
   ``We had thought that perhaps the emperor's internal bleeding had
stopped, but the discharges show that there's been no basic change
in his condition,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Hirohito's internal bleeding, apparently from his upper
intestine, began Sept. 19.
   After more than two months' confinement to his bed, the emperor
has grown increasingly feeble. He sleeps much of the time and
generally is too weak to speak, although he understands what is
being said to him, the palace official said.
   Doctors gave Hirohito a blood transfusion Thursday to combat his
worsening anemia, Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda
said. The transfusion raised the total amount of blood the emperor
has received since Sept. 19 to nearly 44{ pints, more than five
times the normal amount in his body.
   Palace officials have refused to comment on reports the emperor
has cancer.

   Just because actress and game show star Vanna
White in a toga grabs almost as much attention as World War II, one
shouldn't gloat.
   NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff decided he sounded
too smug in an earlier statement, so he apologized for things he
said after his network, with the help of Miss White's ``The Goddess
of Love,'' beat ABC and ``War And Remembrance'' in last week's
ratings.
   ``If the impression is that we were jumping in the air over
winning a week in the November ratings sweeps, I regret it,''
Tartikoff said Wednesday.
   Tartikoff was replying to his own statement released after news
that the TV movie ``The Goddess of Love'' earned ratings almost
equal to the 17{-hour megaseries to push NBC ahead of ABC for the
week. Miss White is normally seen on the game show, ``Wheel of
Fortune.''
   The statement said: ``Our calculated plan of youth-oriented
counterprogramming coupled with aggressive and creative promotion,
had the absolute right effect with the viewing audience. I'm happy
NBC has kept its prime-time win streak alive.''
   Tartikoff now says he should have toned the statement down a bit.
   He also praised ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard and
Dan Curtis, who produced and directed ``War and Rememberance.''
   He called the show itself, about Nazi anti-Semitism and the
Holocaust, ``a monumental achievement.''
   ``It is landmark TV,'' Tartikoff said.

   Residents here remember Linda
Petursdottir as friendly and fun-loving, pretty but modest and too
shy to appear in the school play.
   It turns out the 18-year-old Iceland native has won $54,000 for
parading in a bathing suit.
   Petursdottir, who was an American Field Service exchange student
in Sandstone during the 1986-87 school year, was crowned Miss World
in London Nov. 17.
   A blonde with big blue eyes and strong features, Petursdottir,
18, was judged most beautiful in a bathing suit and evening gown
among 84 competitors. She won $54,000 in cash, a new car, a
luxurious wardrobe, world travel and modeling contracts.
   ``I don't expect she'll behave any differently to me,'' said her
friend Dan Bonnin, who plans to visit Petursdottir in Iceland next
month.
   Jeannette Kester, Petursdottir's host mother in Sandstone, got a
call from her Saturday.
   ``All of a sudden I heard this voice: `Hi, Mom!' And it was just
like always,'' Kester said.
   Friends say a year of official appearances could change one thing
about Petursdottir _ her shyness.
   ``It's hard not to be confident when you're Miss World,'' Bonnin
said.

   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson granted a
Thanksgiving pardon for a turkey that offended Green Bay Packers
Coach Lindy Infante when it waddled onto a football field during a
game with the Indianapolis Colts.
   Infante called the Nov. 13 stunt insulting to his NFL club. There
were predictions the intruder would be drafted for Thanksgiving
dinner.
   But the governor's office said Thompson agreed to save the turkey
from capital punishment.
   Thompson aides said they got a telephone call from CBS Sports,
suggesting some holiday humor. Aides responded by taking Thompson to
a Madison television studio to tape the mock pardon.
   The 60-second segment, they said, was to be used by ``NFL Today''
following the Detroit Lions-Minnesota Vikings televised game
Thursday.
   The turkey, smuggled into the Packers-Colts game at Lambeau
Field, was turned loose between the first and second quarters. The
game was delayed about two minutes while the bird was cornered.
   It was set free in a wildlife refuge near Green Bay. A Green Bay
television station reported it last week at the Brown County
Reforestation Camp.
   Marcy Gause, a station spokeswoman, said public sentiment was on
the side of the turkey.
   ``They're saying they can't kill him now,'' Gause said. ``He's
become so famous.''

   Jacques Cousteau, French underwater explorer,
filmmaker and ardent defender of the world's waterways, was elected
Thursday to the prestigious French Academy.
   The 353-year-old Academy, whose 40 members are known as
``Immortals,'' also elected Greek scholar Jacqueline de Romilly,
only the second woman after the late novelist Marguerite Yourcenar,
to don the famed green and gold suit.
   A professor at the College de France and founder of the chair in
Greek civilization which she currently occupies, De Romilly, 75, is
the author of some 15 works on Greek philosophy and literature.
   Cousteau, 78, the author of some 20 books and 90 feature films
and television documentaries, has enabled millions of land-locked
readers and viewers to discover the mysteries of a previously
unknown universe beneath the seas.
   Cousteau won an Emmy last year for his series on American
television, ``The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.''
   He is the co-inventor of the aqua-lung and the developer of other
technological innovations such as a one-man jet-propelled submarine
and the first manned undersea colonies.

   Twenty-seven crewmen aboard a Greek
freighter were rescued by a helicopter today after their ship began
taking on water while being battered by 20-foot waves off Nova
Scotia.
   Rescuers aboard an army helicopter used a rope and harness to
lift the men from the deck of the 375-foot Katia to a nearby bulk
carrier, the Sankomoon, according to a spokesman for the Halifax
Search and Rescue Coordination Center.
   ``Nobody injured,'' said the skipper of the Sankomoon in a
ship-to-shore interview. ``Nobody hurt. Nobody sick. Everybody
healthy.''
   The Katia, a 5,000-ton freighter registered in Liberia, sent out
a distress call shortly after midnight when it was 225 miles
southeast of Nova Scotia's southern tip. The crew reported it could
not cope with the intake of water.
   The Katia is owned by Seatriumph Marine Corp. of Piraeus, Greece.
In an interview from Piraeus, a spokesman for the company said the
crew was from the Philippines and the officers were East Indian.
   The Katia was on its way to Halifax to refuel before heading to
Quebec with a load of twine.
   The Sankomoon had been headed to Turkey when it stopped to rescue
the freighter's crew.

   Deadlocked lawmakers Thursday averted the
threat of Thanksgiving dinner at the Statehouse by adopting an
unprecedented ``speaker du jour'' plan under which a Democrat and a
Republican will preside on alternating days.
   The 100-member Indiana House, evenly divided between Republicans
and Democrats for the first time in history, also will give some
powers previously held by the House speaker to the chamber's
membership, breaking the speaker's 132-year domination of the
chamber.
   The agreement, sealed by party leaders' handshake at 2:10 a.m.,
broke a two-day stalemate. The announcement was greeted by two
standing ovations by lawmakers who had feared the conflict would
ruin their holiday.
   In addition to alternating speakers, both parties will have a
co-chairman and equal membership on each committee, and there will
be one clerk from each party to run the day-to-day administration of
the chamber.
   Republicans had controlled the chamber for 12 years before
Democrats picked up two seats in the Nov. 8 election to force the
tie. The GOP still controls the Senate, although Democrats picked up
four seats to narrow the margin to 26-24. Evan Bayh also was elected
the state's first Democratic governor in 20 years.
   ``It will work, but it won't work easy,'' said Rep. Patrick J.
Kiely, a Republican and past chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee. ``Everybody will have to work at it. If it gets partisan,
it won't work.''
   The agreement ``could well mean a diminishing of partisan
discussions we've had in the past and we don't need to have,'' said
Rep. Jeffrey K. Espich, also a Republican.
   The accord, dubbed the ``speaker du jour'' or speaker of the day
plan, was reached after two days of closed-door negotiations between
Republican leader Paul S. Mannweiler, Democratic leader Michael K.
Phillips and their key advisers.
   Mannweiler and Phillips are scheduled to be formally named
co-speakers next Wednesday when the House reconvenes to ratify a
final draft of the agreement. The House first met Tuesday to
organize and will return for regular business in January.
   Phillips said the agreement ``truly returned the power to the
elected members of this body.'' He said it restores fairness and
equity to a legislative process dominated too long by powerful
speakers.
   ``These are extraordinary times, and they require extraordinary
action,'' said Mannweiler, an Indianapolis lawyer who served as
House speaker the last two years.
   ``If given the opportunity, I think it will work,'' he said.
``It's a whole new system for us.''
   The plan has several rules changes, including one giving members
the right to call down their bills for votes on the floor.
Previously, only the speaker decided which bills would be voted on,
and his ability to kill a bill by refusing to call it constituted
one of the speaker's most important powers.
   ``The speaker will become more or less like a traffic cop,'' said
Rep. J. Jeff Hays, a Democrat and a longtime member. ``There will
have to be a lot of cooperation.''
   ``We guaranteed that Paul Mannweiler and Mike Phillips cannot be
arrogant or partisan or autocratic,'' said Rep. Stanley Jones, one
of the Democratic negotiators.
   In another rule change, a bill that gets a tie vote in committee
will advance to the floor. Previously, a bill needed a majority vote
to advance.
   Safeguards will allow each party an equal chance to advance
legislation. Each committee co-chairman will have five so-called
``wild cards'' that, when used, will permit a bill to be heard in a
committee even if the other party's co-chairman objects. On the
budget-writing Ways and Means Committee, each co-chairman will have
10 wild cards.
   Kiely previously was the sole chairman of Ways and Means. Now
he'll have to share power.
   ``Before if I didn't want to hear something, I just didn't hear
it,'' Kiely said. ``Now I lose all kinds of pressure in this
situation because it won't be all my decision.''

   A federal policy denying Soviet nuclear
site inspectors the chance to visit local homes for Thanksgiving and
Christmas runs counter to the effort toward improving relations
between the two nations, a peace group says.
   The inspectors here as part of a U.S.-Soviet nuclear treaty can
not accept invitations to private homes under a U.S. Department of
Defense policy.
   Rosemary A. Holt, president of Women Concerned About Nuclear War,
said the rules ``thwart the development of better relations between
our two countries and encourage the old mentality that `we need to
have an enemy.'''
   The group asked the On-Site Inspection Agency to allow Soviet
inspectors living in Utah to spend Thanksgiving at the home of
University of Utah law professor Ed Firmage.
   The Defense Department said the Soviets may visit public places,
including schools and churches, but can not accept invitations to
private homes.
   The decision was for security reasons, a spokesman said.
   ``It's not a good idea, from a security aspect, to provide
security for the Soviets if they're going to individual homes,''
said the spokesman, who spoke on condition that his name not be used.
   ``But we'll allow the Soviets to visit public places, such as
churches, schools or just about any civic organization you can think
of,'' he said. ``We're simply saying `No' to requests that the
Soviets visit individual homes. There's just too many requests to
consider, and it makes guaranteeing their safety too difficult.''
   ``I'm underwhelmed with such reasoning,'' said Firmage. ``How is
it any less difficult to ensure security in a public building that
has many offices and entrances than it is for a private home?''
   The Defense Department spokesman said the Soviet inspectors would
be served a turkey dinner by a linguist at their living quarters in
Salt Lake City.
   Under terms of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, Soviet
inspectors may not travel outside a 31-mile radius of the Hercules
Aerospace plant in Magna, a suburb of Salt Lake City, and they must
be escorted at all times by American guards. The same conditions
apply to American inspectors living in the Soviet Union.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a defense
request to question a Holocaust survivor to determine if he was
intimidated from testifying at John Demjanjuk's Nazi war crimes
trial, a court spokesman said.
   The five-judge panel ruled Richard Glazier could not be
questioned in Switzerland, where he now resides, as part of
Demjanjuk's appeal hearing, spokesman Yossi Hassin said. The hearing
is to begin Dec. 5.
   Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker from suburban Cleveland, is
appealing a conviction and death sentence for Nazi war crimes handed
down in April.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, 68, was convicted of being ``Ivan
the Terrible,'' a brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed
850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   Demjanjuk maintains he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity.
   In the defense motion, Israeli defense attorney Yoram Sheftel
contended a taped conversation between Glazier and a defense
representative in 1986 showed Glazier was pressured by Israeli
authorities not to give testimony that would have cleared Demjanjuk.
   The prosecution contends Glazier was not called to testify
because he never saw ``Ivan the Terrible.''
   The judges agreed, however, to the defense submission of an album
of press clippings collected by the three-judge panel that convicted
Demjanjuk. The defense contends the clippings show the judges were
biased against Demjanjuk.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Will Visit Tehran, Plead Case of Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
will try to negotiate the release of foreign hostages held in
Lebanon during a visit to Iran that begins this weekend, diplomatic
sources said Thursday.
   ``The minister has offered his services to secure the release of
all hostages and the Iranian government has assured us that this
corresponds with their aims,'' an official source said privately.
   Nearly all the hostages are believed held by Lebanese Shiite
Moslem extremists loyal to Iran.
   Iranian media also the 14 hostages, who include nine Americans,
were among Genscher's principal motives for the two-day trip, which
begins Sunday. The English-language Tehran Times said he might make
a special effort in the case of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite.
   Iran has said consistently it has no control over the activities
of Shiite groups in Lebanon, but the government source a second West
German official said Genscher would make another plea for
interecession.
   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985. Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel in
Moslem west Beirut to negotiate for the release of Anderson and
other Americans.
   Some foreign businessmen and diplomats in Bonn feel Iran may be
willing to trade its influence with the captors for favorable
European trade agreements to repair an economy ravaged by eight
years of war with Iraq.
   West Germany is among Iran's main trading partners. The Economics
Ministry says Iran continues to import more goods from West Germany
than from any other country despite a decline due to the war, in
which a cease-fire began Aug. 20.
   Foreign Ministry announcements have said only that Genscher will
meet with senior Iranian government officials and industry leaders.
   No Germans are among the hostages now held in Lebanon.
   West German officials, including Genscher, said they won the
release of hostages Alfred Schmidt and Rudolf Cordes through long
negotiations and the help of Iranian and Syrian officials. They have
denied media reports of ransom.
   In September, the Hamburg newspaper Bild said as much as $22.2
million was paid for the release of Cordes.
   He and Schmidt were kidnapped in January 1987 after a Lebanese
Shiite, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, was arrested and charged with murder
and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner. Hamadi
is being tried in Frankfurt.
   Schmidt was released Sept. 7, 1987, and Cordes was freed two
months ago.
   Asked whether Genscher expected a breakthrough in Waite's case,
one Bonn diplomat said the matter would be raised with Iranian
officials but he could not disclose details.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, carried a report Thursday from the Tehran Times that said:
``A good guess, perhaps, is the possibility that Genscher's
discussions may turn a searchlight on the solution to the hostage
issue in Lebanon, and the crisis this has generated.
   ``Is it possible then that the German minister is here as a
mediator? Everything points to this being the case, and this accords
with recent moves to have Terry Waite, the Archbishop of
Canterbury's representative taken hostage in Lebanon, released.''
   ``A number of requests have been made in recent months for the
release of hostages in Lebanon and for Iran to use its ideological
influence there on humanitarian considerations to that end,'' the
newspaper was quoted as saying.
   Some observers believe greater trade volume might generate more
serious Iranian efforts to free the hostages.
   West Germany sold Iran $1.5 billion worth of goods in 1987,
including motor vehicles, heavy machinery and electronic products,
and its Iranian imports totaled $500 million.
   About 30 prominent businessmen will accompany Genscher, who last
visited Iran in July 1984.

<TEXT>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ President Reagan and his wife Nancy
gathered with relatives and friends Thursday for a quiet
Thanksgiving dinner at their mountaintop California ranch.
   Reagan's daughter, Maureen, who was present for last Monday's
ground-breaking ceremonies for the presidential library in Simi
Valley, Calif., was accompanied by her husband, Dennis Revell.
   Also attending the dinner at the Reagans' 688-acre ranch nesteled
in the Santa Ynez Mountains about 30 miles north of here were Mrs.
Reagan's personal secretary, Jane Erkenbeck; the first lady's press
secretary, Elaine Crispen; and Mrs. Crispen's daughter, Cheryl.
   The weather was overcast and damp, following a day of unusually
heavy rain along the Southern California coastline. As a result, the
Reagans had not been able to do as much horse-back riding as usual,
White House officials said.
   Besides turkey, the Thanksgiving dinner menu included cornbread
dressing, cranberries, string beans with almonds, mashed potatoes,
salad and pumpkin pie with whipped cream.
   The guests also were getting to sample some Monkey bread, a
sweet-bread that is dropped in a pan, like muffins, and is pulled
apart piece by piece.
   Mrs. Crispen said this has been a fixture on the Reagan holiday
menus ever since Mrs. Reagan discovered it while shopping at Sandy's
Bakery in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.
   The vacation, which ends Sunday with the Reagans' return to
Washington, was their last at Rancho del Cielo before the
president's term expires Jan. 20.
   The Reagans will return to the West Coast on Dec. 23, with plans
to spend five days in Los Angeles around the Christmas holiday and
another five days in Palm Springs where they traditionally spend New
Year's Eve at the home of millionaire publisher and family friend
Walter Annenberg.
   Reagan's son, Ron, and his wife, Doria, are to visit the first
couple at the ranch on Friday, and remain there for the night.

   The Louvre has been closed since Monday because of a
strike by guards protesting a plan to change the hours the museum is
open, officials said Thursday.
   The four unions representing the 350 guards said nearly all were
observing the strike, preventing tourists from viewing the immense
collection, which includes such masterpieces as the Mona Lisa, the
Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.
   The museum administration is proposing new hours of 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. Its current hours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
   The four unions said the museum should consider the ``constraints
these new hours would make in the lives of the employees'' and
negotiate hours in which most guards would still work from 9 a.m. to
6 p.m., with some staying until 7 p.m.

   President-elect George Bush and his

   Bush also jogged in the morning for about 20 minutes along a
wooded dirt road near his house, greeting reporters but declining to

   ``It's going to be great,' Bush said of his day.
   The Bushes had an early afternoon dinner of roasted turkey,
stuffing and sweet potatoes with two employes, housekeeper Paola
Rendon and Don Rhodes, an aide in the vice president's Senate
office, said spokesman Stephen Hart.
   The Bushes also greeted at their boat dock members of the crew
from the Coast Guard cutter patroling the waters offshore, spending
about 15 minutes with them. The crew came to Bush's dock in a small
boat.
   Hart said that Bush had no official meetings planned and
considered the day to be one of rest.

   Woman recruits at an Israeli army base lined up
for morning reveille wearing only brassieres and army trousers to
protest what they said was their commander's harsh treatment, an
army spokesman said Thursday.
   ``It was a prank by new recruits,'' the army spokesman said.
``They appeared at the morning lineup in irregular clothing.''
   The spokesman said the soldiers who took part will be banned from
the ceremonial parade that marks the end of basic training and also
will be given extra chores at the base.
   ``The soldiers will be punished for this,'' the army spokesman
said. ``They have given up their right to appear on the parade field
for the ceremony at the end of basic training.''
   The army said the event occured about two weeks ago at a base in
central Israel. It would not specify the location of the base, the
number of troops involved or the treatment that the soldiers
objected to.
   The soldier who organized the protest has been given a 10-day
suspended sentence, the army said.
   Israeli women serve for two years in the army following high
school. They generally work in support roles and are forbidden from
entering combat zones.

   Eight people suing William Cruse over the

damages at $100,000 _ if they can collect from his insurance
company, their attorney said.
   The cases had been scheduled to go to trial Monday in front of
Circuit Judge John Antoon.
   However, Allstate Insurance Co., which issued Cruse's homeowner
policy, contends in a pending federal suit that the policy doesn't
cover Cruse's actions on April 23, 1987.
   Cruse, 61, a retired librarian, still faces a criminal trial in
March on six counts of murder, 28 charges of attempted murder and
two charges of kidnapping. More than 100 witnesses are preparing to
identify Cruse as the gunman who strode resolutely through two
supermarket parking lots, shooting an automatic rifle
indiscriminately.

   Officials in Washington reportedly
have renewed an investigation into possible improprieties in the way
prosecutors in Florida conducted a probe into illegal military aid
to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Feldman said Wednesday he
testified last month at closed-door hearings of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, which is looking into the way the Contra
investigation started in Miami was handled.
   ``I did this because it was my ethical responsibility to report
any perceived ethical or legal violation that may have occurred
while the case was under review by the Justice Department and the
supervisors at the U.S. Attorney's Office,'' Feldman said.
   Feldman, the original prosecutor in the case that began in
January 1986, refused to disclose what he told investigators,
according to a story Thursday in the Fort Lauderdale News &
Sun-Sentinel.
   The newspaper said investigators are now focusing on whether the
Reagan administration deliberately stalled the investigation that
began in Miami in January 1986 to cover up Oliver North's activities
and the administration's role.
   An investigation of improprieties involving former U.S. Attorney
General Edwin Meese and former U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner was not
pursued when substantial evidence of irregularities did not turn up.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen in Miami confirmed that this month
a team of investigators from the independent counsel asked to
interview people who were in office when the Contra inquiry was
under way.
   Former Assistant U.S. Attorney David Leiwant said Wednesday that
he was interviewed in Miami last week by two FBI agents and a
government attorney from the independent counsel's office, but had
nothing new to add. He was also interviewed in March 1987.
   The U.S. attorney's office investigation at question resulted in
indictments of 13 men who range in profession from an Alabama
produce dealer to a Texas oilman now living in France.
   The indictments, unsealed in July and August, accused the men of
aiding the Contra rebels militarily even though the United States
had not declared war on Nicaragua.
   A report released in November 1987 by the congressional
committees that investigated the Iran-Contra affair said that the
case had been monitored by top Reagan administration officials since
it began.
   That report, released in November 1987, said that national
security adviser John Poindexter and aide Lt. Col. North ``were able
to obtain information concerning the vulnerability of the
Enterprise'' _ the covert plan to give Iran and the Contras weapons
_ from government officials familiar with the Miami case.
   John Russell, a spokesman for the Justice Department in
Washington, said he had no comment on the revived investigations.

<HEAD>Florida Judge Gives Matta 3-Year Sentence for Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reputed drug lord whose recapture
touched off riots in Honduras has been sentenced to three years
behind bars for a prison escape 17 years ago.
   The sentencing of Juan Ramon Matta, 43, took place Tuesday at the
federal maximum security prison in Marion, Ill., where he is being
held.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson went to the prison to conduct
the sentencing as a cost-cutting measure instead of having Matta
brought to this Florida Panhandle city. Matta, 43, was convicted
here Sept. 13.
   Whenever Matta leaves prison, about 25 guards accompany him
because he is considered a very high-risk inmate. Taxpayers saved
about $14,500 by avoiding a travel bill for the guards, said U.S.
Marshal Mac McLendon of Pensacola.
   The prison sentencing was agreed to by Matta's lawyer, Martin
Stolar of New York. He said he hoped a delay in the sentencing,
originally scheduled for Oct. 27 in Pensacola, would reduce what he
called hysteria surrounding his client. Vinson was unable to make
the trip at that time because he was in the midst of a trial.
   Matta escaped from the minimum-security federal prison camp at
Eglin Air Force Base about 40 miles east of Pensacola in 1971 while
serving a three-year term for illegally entering the United States.
   Several people were killed and the U.S. consulate was set afire
in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa during rioting that followed
his arrest there April 5.
   Demonstrators claimed Matta's extradition to the United States by
way of the Dominican Republic violated the Honduran constitution. He
was taken into custody by U.S. marshals when his plane arrived in
New York.
   Matta is under indictment in three narcotics cases in California
and one in Arizona. He also had been wanted for questioning in the
1985 slaying of a U.S. drug enforcement agent in Mexico but has not
been charged in that case.
   Matta had been living openly in Tegucigalpa since 1986 when he
escaped from a Colombian prison where he had been held on charges
involving the Medellin drug cartel.
   Honduran police used helicopters to raid his home and then sent
him out of the country accompanied by U.S. officials.
   Matta is appealing the escape conviction on grounds his arrest
was illegal. His lawyer had made the same argument to Vinson prior
to trial but the judge rejected it.

<TEXT>
   Wieland Herzfelde, a leading publisher and writer
who was persecuted by the Nazis for his communist views, died in
East Berlin on Wednesday at the age of 93.
   The Swiss-born writer and intellectual spent 10 years in New York
during the Nazi dictatorship. In 1944 he founded the Aurora Verlag
publishing house in New York, working with noted German writers such
as Bertolt Brecht, Heinrich Mann and Alfred Doeblin.
   Born in Weggis, Switzerland, on April 11, 1896, Herzfelde grew up
in Austria and Germany. In 1917 he founded the Berlin publishing
house Malik Verlag, which printed Dadaist and anti-war literature
and the works of young Soviet writers.
   The publishing house was banned by the Nazis in 1933, and
Herzfelde, a member of the German Communist Party since 1918, fled
the country.
   He first emigrated to Prague, where he published a magazine
together with other German writers and intellectuals in exile.
   In 1939, as Adolf Hitler's Third Reich spread throughout Europe,
Herzfelde fled to New York.
   He emigrated to communist-ruled East Germany in 1949, and
remained there until his death. Herzfelde continued his work as a
writer and publisher, and was also a literature professor at the
University of Leipzig.

<HEAD>Britain Postpones Decision on U.S. Tanks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Cabinet failed Thursday to resolve its
dilemma over whether to re-equip the army with British or U.S.
battle tanks, but officials said a decision likely would be made
before Christmas.
   At stake is an order worth at least $2 billion for a new
generation of 500 tanks to replace Britain's aging homemade
Chieftains.
   The choice is between the M1 Abrams, made by General Dynamics
Corp. in Michigan, and Challenger Mark 2, built by Vickers PLC of
Britain.
   Vickers, the sole British tankmaker, says that if Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government buys American it will kill Britain's
tank manufacturing capacity and lose this country billions of
dollars of Middle East orders.
   ``They had a good look at it,'' a government spokesman said
Thursday after Mrs. Thatcher and her ministers debated the issue at
a Cabinet meeting.
   ``They identified further points that need to be looked at, but
its a complex issue. We hope to have a decision within weeks,''
added the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Defense Ministry has refused to comment on reports that
British military chiefs have doubts about the Challenger's fire
control system and prefer the Abrams tank for its sophistication and
off-the-shelf availability.
   Vickers chairman Sir David Plastow says the company has solved
the fire control problems and can produce a competitive tank at its
plant in Leeds, central England.
   He added that if Vickers loses the order, Britain will cease to
be an international tank manufacturer, leaving the lucrative Middle
East market to the Soviets and Americans.
   In its last major choice between British or American weapons, the
Thatcher government in 1986 opted for the U.S. Boeing airborne early
warning radar systems and scrapped a Nimrod version by the British
General Electric Co. on grounds it did not work properly.
   Legislator Derek Fatchett, who represents a Leeds constituency,
said the Cabinet delay Thursday in the tank decision ``indicates a
growing interest in the American alternative.''
   He said Defense Secretary George Younger had made no
recommendation to the Cabinet, adding, ``That is an abdication of
his responsibilities to the country's defense industry.''

   In a secret ballot, senators decided Thursday to join
the lower house of Parliament in all but abolishing the secret
ballot.
   The action, aimed at adding stability to Italian government,
completed a victory for Premier Ciriaco De Mita who had indicated he
would resign if the measure did not pass in the Chamber of Deputies.
   Open voting in Parliament is expected to strengthen the executive
system and create a more stable political climate in the country
that has had 48 postwar governments.
   With the secret vote, governments often were confronted by
``snipers'' who used the secret ballot to vote against their party
line, particularly to ensure passage of pet spending products.
   Now, parliamentarians who vote against their party directives
will do so at their own risk.
   Senators voted 165-132 with two abstentions Thursday to abolish
the secret vote except on measures involving personal rights, family
rights and in votes on procedures or personnel, such as the election
of a Senate president. The government needed 150 votes in the Senate
to abolish the vote.
   The Senate rejected amendments that would have also retained the
secret vote on measures involving constitutional law or on proposals
to amend parlimentary procedures.
   Under the Chamber's rules, secret votes are still allowed on
measures dealing with special government bodies such as the
anti-Mafia commission, specific persons, issues of conscience such
as abortion, personal liberties and substantive changes in the
constitution.
   Italy was one of the few Western democracies where most
parliamentary votes were secret and citizens had no certainty about
how their representatives voted on various issues.

<HEAD>Shortage Forces Hemophiliacs To Use Potentially Unsafe Blood
Product</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of hemophiliacs nationwide must use
a blood-clotting product that could contain the AIDS virus because
of a severe shortage of the product normally used, doctors and
officials said.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has impounded millions of
units of the usual concentrate, called Factor 8, after declaring it
was improperly screened for contamination.
   As a result, many patients needing large amounts of the clotting
substance must be given cryo-precipitate, a relatively crude
preparation made from fresh plasma that carries a higher risk of
contamination than the impounded concentrate, doctors said.
   ``It's really very ironic,'' said Dr. Carol Kasper, director of
the Hemophilia Center at Orthopedic Hospital in Los Angeles, one of
the largest hemophilia clinics in the world.
   ``Our supply of concentrate is one-third of what we usually
have,'' Kasper said Wednesday. ``We cannot do elective surgery. We
have to restrict the amount patients take home.''
   Hemophiliacs depend on injections of concentrate because their
bodies lack the ability to produce clotting substances, putting them
at constant risk of severe internal bleeding from everyday
activities.
   The American Red Cross, which usually provides 20 percent of the
nation's supply of concentrate, was ordered to keep its concentrate
on the shelf because of a slight chance the product harbors the
hepatitis or AIDS viruses.
   An FDA audit found that in a few instances the blood banks had
not followed regulations for screening blood, from which concentrate
is made.
   Despite the order, federal and Red Cross officials agree that it
is highly unlikely that the concentrate is tainted. The concentrate
has already been treated to destroy any viruses that might have
slipped through the screening.
   ``My feeling is the products they are preparing are likely to be
perfectly safe,'' said Dr. Joel Solomon, director of blood products
for the FDA.
   Solomon said the FDA cannot bend its regulations and release the
concentrate, however, because of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that held that the agency can be sued for failing to follow its own
regulations.
   ``As a result the FDA and every other federal agency has been put
on notice to be extra careful _ even when we think we have good
cause to release something,'' Solomon said.
   The supply will remain quarantined for several weeks while the
Red Cross attempts to prove that the concentrate is virus-free or
applies for a permit to use it as an experimental substance, he said.
   ``We've gone through this for weeks on end _ the problem is a
legal one and we've been searching for an out,'' Solomon said.

   Mexico has no political prisoners or secret
jails, the government declared Thursday, two days after human rights
activists disrupted the Senate to protest the disappearances of 369
people.
   ``No one is persecuted or jailed in Mexico for their ideas,'' the
Interior Ministry said in a statement. ``There are no political
disappearances or clandestine jails or people who vanish because of
official acts on the margin of the law.''
   Twenty-one mothers of missing people, representing the human
rights movement Eureka, were ejected from the Senate gallery Tuesday
after shouting demands for an investigation of 369 people who
allegedly disappeared for political reasons.
   ``What we want is for our sons to be freed, or at least for
someone to tell us where they are and why they were detained,'' said
the leader of the group, Rosario Ibarra de Piedra. She is a former
presidential candidate whose son, a leftist medical student,
disappeared in 1975.
   The Interior Ministry said Thursday the federal attorney
general's office found nothing amiss when it investigated ``the
situation of the people detained or disappeared since Dec. 1,
1982,'' the beginning of President Miguel de la Madrid's
administration. He leaves office Tuesday.
   It said 37 of the 41 detainees cited by Mrs. Ibarra de Piedra are
either free or held for crimes. The statement said of the other
four: ``Investigations have determined that none of these people
took part in political activities.''
   ``No public security force took part in any act related to these
four people and the supposed disappearances cannot be attributed to
any decision by the Mexican state to violate the rule of law which
it has always respected,'' the ministry declared.
   The human rights organization Amnesty International also has
reported political prisoners and killings in Mexico. The government
said the latest Amnesty allegations, issued last month, ``deform
reality.''
   Amnesty cited reports of ``arbitrary detention and
assassination'' of peasants and Indians in connection with land
disputes. ``Many assassinations were attributed to gunmen linked to
landowners who appeared to have the tacit consent of the
authorities,'' it said.
   According to Amnesty International, at least 23 political
prisoners were held in Mexico in 1987.

   A high-speed patrol boat capable of carrying
130mm rockets and torpedoes was introduced into the Israeli navy
Thursday to repel Palestinian guerrilla raids.
   The Super Dvora, an Israeli-made boat, is ``the fastest military
patrol boat in the world,'' with a top speed of 46 mph, said Navy
officials at a ceremony at the Haifa naval base.
   It will replace the navy's current Dabur class patrol boat and is
twice as fast, the officials said.
   Patrols foiled at least four sea infiltration attempts since
December, the military says. All occurred off the coast of southern
Lebanon, which Israel patrols to block Palestinians from reaching
the Israeli coast.
   The new 71-foot boat weighs 48 tons and has a range of 700 miles.
It was built by Ramta, a subsidiary of the government-owned Israel
Aircraft Industries, and its export price is about $2.5 million, a
company official said.

   A military court paroled an ailing

   Former army Gen. Luis Torres Rojas left Gomez Ulla military

   Torres Rojas, 70, who served half of his 12-year sentence for
military rebellion, was among the last four revolt leaders still in

   The Defense Ministry is studying whether to recommend a pardon
for another ailing leader of the revolt, former army Lt. Gen.
Alfonso Armada, serving a 30-year sentence, he said.
   In the revolt Feb. 23, 1981, a Civil Guard officer and 200 guard

   Iraq will establish a stock exchange to deal
with a growing volume of transactions in shares of newly established
private or government-owned companies, the minister of finance
announced Thursday.
   Minister Hikmat Omer Hadithi told the ruling daily Al-Thawra that
the initial, small-scale financial market will be housed temporarily
at the Industrial Bank before private sector dealers will be allowed
to buy and sell stocks and bonds.
   The minister did not specify when trading will begin.
   The minister said more and more stocks are being traded in Iraq
because many new companies are being set up.
   The government recently offered more than 70 industrial,
agricultural and service projects for sale to the private sector,
but many have not been sold for lack of private capital.
   President Saddam Hussein, since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war, has been trying to liberalize the
country's economic laws to encourage more private investment in
reconstruction projects.

   Price Waterhouse said Thursday it has become the
first international accounting firm to establish operations in the
Hungarian capital of Budapest.
   Price Waterhouse said it hopes to help Hungary set up the first
stock market in an Eastern bloc country, set for 1989.
   It also said it has been appointed special business adviser to
the Hungarian lighting equipment company Tungsram.
   The Price Waterhouse operation in Hungary, widely viewed as the
most open of the Eastern bloc economies, is jointly owned, with two
major Hungarian banks each holding a 10-percent stake in the
venture, Price Waterhouse said. The banks are the Hungarian Foreign
Trade Bank and Budapest Bank.
   Price Waterhouse said it would advise Tungsram, which makes 5
percent of the world's light bulbs, on restructuring and raising
finance on the world markets.
   ``The rapidly changing economic climate in Hungary is creating a
large demand for accounting and management consulting services,''
said Les Bonnay, who will manage the Budapest office.
   ``Hungarian managers now have to cope with a variety of pressures
as the country moves towards a more open economy,'' Bonnay said.
``We're here to help them make their companies more efficient, more
productive, and most of all more competitive in the international
marketplace.''
   Since 1987, the Hungarian government has legislated a variety of
reforms designed to make the economy more market-driven and to
attract more foreign investors.

<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq began a 10-day exchange of
sick and wounded prisoners of war Thursday, but a jet chartered by
the International Red Cross shuttled fewer men than than promised
between the enemy capitals.
   A Red Cross statement issued in Geneva said only 19 Iranians and
41 Iraqis were flown home Thursday despite an accord with both sides
providing for the repatriation of 41 Iranians and 115 Iraqis every
day.
   The statement said the reduced numbers resulted from
``differences of interpretation between the two parties with regard
to criteria and procedures.''
   Iraq, which received the first prisoners, accused Iran of
reneging on the agreement, according to which 1,570 men are to be
repatriated. In retaliation, Baghdad reduced the number of Iranians
sent home.
   A dispatch from Iran's official news agency, monitored in Cyprus,
said fewer Iraqis were returned because 15 of the 115 asked for
political asylum, 21 already had been granted asylum and 27 no
longer were eligible for repatriation because Red Cross doctors
found them recovered from their illnesses.
   It said each departing prisoner was given gifts of Persian
craftwork and a copy of the Koran, the Islamic holy book.
   Iran and Iraq began a cease-fire Aug. 20 after nearly eight years
of war, and this is the first prisoner exchange since the truce. It
is being made under an agreement they signed earlier this month with
the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   Under Red Cross auspices, 765 ill or wounded Iraqis and 613
Iranians have been repatriated since 1981. The Red Cross says it has
registered 50,182 Iraqi POWs and 19,284 Iranians, but the total held
by both countries is estimated at about 100,000.
   Pilot Riegert Poloux said the trip between the capitals, which
are only about 500 miles apart, took 2{ hours because he had to fly
via Turkey.
   He said the governments originally agreed to let the plane use a
direct route, but final arrangements were not made in time. The next
shuttle Saturday is expected to be direct.
   The 730-mile border was the battleground in the war, which began
in September 1980. U.N.-sponsored peace negotiations since the
cease-fire have made little progress and the Red Cross fashioned the
POW exchange agreement in separate talks with Iran and Iraq.
   Iraqi prisoners arriving at Saddam International Airport had
shaved heads, long beards and clean military-style uniforms. Most
wept when they stepped from the DC-9 and many shouted nationalistic
slogans.
   One who knelt to pray on the tarmac at the airport, which is
named for President Saddam Hussein, said afterward: ``It is great to
be home again. I feel reborn.''
   Some shouted ``Long live Iraq! Long live Saddam Hussein!'' Others
bent to kiss the ground while comrades prayed loudly, thanking God
for the return home.
   Red Cross officials helped many out of the plane and turned them
over Iraqi medical personnel. Many were in wheelchairs, some walked
with sticks and all appeared frail.
   Officials would not let reporters interview the repatriated
prisoners.
   When the returning Iraqis were out of the plane, 19 Iranian
prisoners dressed in yellow track suits boarded it. Few were young
and none used wheelchairs or crutches.
   A senior Iraqi officer kissed them goodbye at the plane. Each was
offered a copy of the Koran, but some refused it.
   ``It is not Islamic. I will not take it,'' one said.
   Iraq accused Iran of withholding some Iraqi prisoners for
``political reasons.''
   Akram Witri, head of the legal department at the Foreign
Ministry, said the Red Cross told the Baghdad government a few hours
before the exchange that fewer Iraqis would be repatriated.
   ``We have informed the Red Cross and the United Nations that the
Iranians failed to accomplish their commitment and their
international duties,'' he told a news briefing at the airport just
before the plane arrived.
   He said Iraq would continue the repatriation but will not return
the number agreed upon unless Iran does.
   Witri said the repatriated Iraqi prisoners would be given medical
examinations before rejoining their families.

   President Francois Mitterrand and
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez closed the second Franco-Spanish
summit Thursday by reaffirming their nations' fight against
terrorism, but they announced no new initiatives.
   The two leaders discussed Europe, East-West relations and other
matters, but terrorism dominated the two-day summit, which opened
hours after a bomb attack in Madrid killed two people.
   ``I consider there is no particular announcement to make,''
Mitterrand said at a joint news conference. ``But I reaffirm the
common will to end the serious troubles aimed at the functioning of
our democracies and people's security.''
   Asked about any new initiatives, Gonzales said, ``There is for me
one elementary principle which consists of never giving details on
our strategies in this struggle. I am profoundly satisfied with my
discussions with Francois Mitterrand and with his unequivocal
testimony of solidarity.''
   The two countries have been cooperating against Basque terrorists
with France extraditing Spanish suspects, alleged members of
ETA-Military, who take refuge in the French Basque provinces.
   For years, Spain criticized what it perceived as France's
unwillingness to pursue Basque separatists suspected of terrorism,
and France approached the issue with delicacy, in part because some
suspects had political refugee status in France.

   Planned strikes by air traffic controllers and radar
operators have prompted the cancellation of at least 45 national and
international flights a day in Italy in the next seven days,
newspapers said Thursday.
   In Sudan, meanwhile, air traffic controllers stayed away from
work for a second day Thursday, paralyzing operations in Khartoum's
international airport.
   The Italian air controllers plan to strike daily from 11 a.m.
until 3 p.m. for a week beginning Friday. Radar operators have
declared they will strike from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. Friday through
Monday.
   The controllers and radar operators are demanding higher pay and
lighter workloads. Their strikes are the latest in a series of
national labor contract disputes that have plagued Italian flight
schedules for months. Italian airline pilots ended a strike Thursday.
   The walkout by radar operators also could disrupt flights that
have not already been canceled, news reports said.
   The cancellations, announced by the state-run Alitalia Airlines
and its domestic subsidiary ATI, primarily affect flights to and
from Rome and Naples and selected incoming flights to Rome from
Switzerland, France, Greece and Africa.
   In Sudan, the strike over a wage dispute has halted both domestic
and international flights starting Wednesday morning. It is due to
end Fruday.

<HEAD>New Fighting Erupts in South Beirut; Report Israelis Fire on TV
Crew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias clashed with
mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns for the second
time in three days in south Beirut, police said.
   They said there was no immediate report of casualties from
fighting between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah. They clashed in the densely populated south Beirut slums
of Haret Hreik, Ghobeiri and Mesharrafiyeh.
   Blasts from mortars and grenades echoed across the Lebanese
capital for hours after the hostilities broke out in the afternoon.
Police closed the Beirut airport highway that runs close to the
embattled slums.
   In a separate development, U.N. sources in Tyre said Israeli
troops fired on a three-man West German TV crew that was
photographing United Nations peacekeeping troops in south Lebanon.
There were no casualties.
   The command of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon complained to
the Israeli army about Wednesday's shooting. Israeli officers in
their self-proclaimed security zone contended they fired at the ARD
television crew because they were taking pictures of an Israeli
military position, the sources said.
   Several shots were fired at the U.N.-escorted television crew
near the village of Qaqayet El-Jisr, two miles north of the security
zone, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Beirut, statements from Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Amal,
Arabic for hope, blamed each other for breaking a cease-fire called
Tuesday to halt an eight-hour flare-up in which two combatants were
killed and 10 wounded.
   Police said they could not tell what shattered that truce, which
was negotiated by the Syrian command of a peacekeeping force in
charge of security in Beirut's Moslem sector.
   The two factions long have been vying for dominance of the 1
million Shiites who are the largest single sect among Lebanon's 4
million people.
   Hezbollah has accused Amal of attempting to assassinate four
senior Hezbollah leaders by a remote-controlled car bomb in east
Lebanon's Bekaa valley on Monday. The four escaped unharmed.
   Amal earlier accused Hezbollah of assassinating its three top
commanders in a south Beirut ambush Sept. 22.

<HEAD>No Vietnamese Pullout From Cambodia, Thais Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam has withdrawn none of the 50,000
troops it pledged to pull out of Cambodia by year's end, a Thai
military official said Thursday.
   But Col. Phanom Jinavijarana of the northeastern Burapa Field
Force said about 29,000 Vietnamese troops have retreated up to 20
miles from the Thai-Cambodian border.
   Two other regional field forces, however, interpreted recent
Vietnamese troop movements inside Cambodia as regular troop
rotations and reinforcements.
   ``Fresh units being sent to free others near the (Thai-Cambodia)
border would suggest Vietnam's new readiness to engage in escalated
fighting with the Cambodian resistance groups,'' Lt. Patana Jiranant
of the eastern Chantaburi-Trat Field Force told a monthly news
conference.
   Western analysts say more than 100,000 Vietnamese troops are in
Cambodia fighting a three-party resistance coalition of the Khmer
Rouge and two non-communist groups. Hanoi pledged to pull out all
its forces by 1990.
   Fighting is expected to intensify over the next several months,
said Supreme Command spokesman Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth.
   Shells from fighting that began in early October have landed
inside six Thai border provinces, killing and wounding an
unspecified number of Thais, Naruedol said. He added that the dry
season has made it easier for warring groups to transport arms and
rapidly mobilize their troops.
   Naruedol said Vietnamese forces continued to pursue and ambush
the resistance forces, with skirmishes in Cambodia's western
provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey and Pursat.
   The Vietnamese, he said, also had taken positions on strategic
hills and built roads to facilitate troop deployment.
   Naruedol expressed skepticism over a recent Laotian claim that
all Vietnamese troops in communist Laos had returned to Vietnam.
   He was responding to a statement Tuesday by Laos' Deputy Foreign
Minister Soubanh Sarithirat who told Thai reporters in Vientiane
that all Hanoi's troops had left that country.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two dozen men in Sri Lankan
army uniforms raided a sugar factory, shooting managers and their
wives and killing four after robbing them, officials said Thursday.
   An Indian and a Sri Lankan executive died when about 25 gunmen
attacked the factory's residence Wednesday night, police said.
Another Indian executive was wounded and the wives of both Indians
were killed, they said.
   ``The gunmen demanded money and after being given money, they
opened fire,'' a senior police official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Police said they did not know how much money the gunmen took.
   In another development, a Cabinet minister said extremists killed
445 Sri Lankans between Oct. 15 and Nov. 15. He blamed 324 of the
killings on Sinhalese radicals and the rest on Tamil rebels.
   Many Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, want a separate homeland
because they say they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist. Sinhalese extremists say
a July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the civil war grants too
many concessions to Tamils. Indian troops are on the island to help
enforce the accord.
   Police initially attributed the sugar mill attack in southeastern
Sri Lanka to an extremist Sinhalese group, the People's Liberation
Front, but later said they were not sure of the attackers' identity.
   A spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, said
the attack was carried out by either Sinhalese extremists or Tamil
rebels. The spokeswoman, commenting on condition of anonymity, said
the dead Sri Lankan executive was Sinhalese.
   The sugar mill, an Indian-Sri Lankan joint business venture, is
in Siyambalanduwa, about 110 miles east of Colombo. Tamil rebels
have not been known to operate that far south, although they have
staged attacks about 20 miles north of Siyambalanduwa.
   The People's Liberation Front has used army uniforms in the past,
and front members routinely raid army camps in search of weapons.
According to the government, some members of the front are Sri
Lankan army deserters.
   The Cabinet minister's report on ethnic killings came during a
monthly debate in Parliament on extending emergency laws that have
routinely been renewed since the Tamil separatist war started in
1983. Emergency rule was extended by a vote of 80-2 in the
168-member Parliament, which has been plagued by absenteeism and
boycotts.
   Vincent Perera, minister of sports and parliamentary affairs,
said Tamil rebels killed 115 Sinhalese civilians and six Sri Lankan
security men in northern and eastern Sri Lanka in the month ending
Nov. 15. He said Sinhalese radicals had committed 112 ``political
murders'' and 212 ``other murders'' in southern and central Sri
Lanka.
   Perera said the victims of ``political murders'' were government
supporters and politicians. He said ``other murders'' referred to
the killings of government officials, police informers and civilians
who ignored strike calls issued by the People's Liberation Front.
   The front has called a series of strikes to press for the
dissolution of Parliament and the resignation of President Junius R.
Jayewardene.
   Jayewardene has said he will step down after the Dec. 19
elections to choose his successor, but the front claims his
government will not conduct a fair vote.
   About 8,500 people, mostly Sinhalese civilians, have been killed
in the Tamil guerrilla war and massacres since 1983.
   The accord offered Tamils a measure of autonomy if Tamil fighters
surrender their arms, but the largest Tamil militia rejected the
accord and is battling Indian forces. India became involved because
of its role as a regional power and the political clout of its own
Tamil minority.

<HEAD>Report Arafat Calls Moratorium on Attacks Against Israel from
Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese newsletter claimed Thursday
that PLO leader Yasser Arafat has called a moratorium on guerrilla
attacks against Israel from Lebanon.
   It is part of Arafat's efforts to promote the newly declared
independent Palestinian state, said the English-language daily
Middle East Reporter.
   Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization already has received orders to halt attacks against
Israel by Lebanon-based guerrillas, the newspaper said.
   It quoted unidentified Palestinian sources as saying Arafat was
negotiating to get other PLO groups to abide by the moratorium.
   For 20 years Palestinian guerrillas have launched cross-border
attacks against northern Israeli settlements from southern Lebanon.
Earlier this year Lebanon abrogated a 1969 accord permitting the PLO
to use Lebanese territory for such attacks, but the guerrillas
ignore it.
   Middle East Reporter said Syrian-backed guerrillas opposed to
Arafat ``may try to escalate their guerrilla activity from the
Lebanese side of the border to discredit him and his policy.'' It
did not elaborate.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
declared an independent Palestinian state Nov. 15 at a conference in
Algiers.
   It also renounced terrorism and endorsed United Nations Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338, indirectly recognizing Israel's
right to exist.
   The PLO has announced that Arafat will address the U.N. General
Assembly in New York on the Middle East situation early in December.
   The United Nations has asked the U.S. State Department to
facilitate granting Arafat a visa.
   The PLO leader arrived in Qatar on Thursday and immediately held
talks with the emir, Sheik Khalifa Bin Hamad Thani, continuing his
swing through Arab capitals following the proclamation of a
Palestinian state.
   He already has visited North and South Yemen, Egypt, Iraq,
Morocco and Mauritania.
   The official Qatar news agency said Arafat and the emir discussed
ways of consolidating and escalating the nearly yearlong Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arafat has said that 54 Arab, Islamic and non-aligned countries
have extended diplomatic ties to the new state, which would include
both territories occupied by Israel since 1967.

<HEAD>Kids The Losers As Schools Boards Are Probed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Local residents say they're not counting on much
improvement around P.S. 64, the school where some of the local
district's suspended board members were said to have cocaine parties.
   Nothing seemed to change after a principal at a nearby elementary
school in the same South Bronx district was arrested recently on
drug charges.
   ``You got kids on drugs, you got teachers on drugs and you got an
administration on drugs,'' said Patricia Martin, the mother of two
students at P.S. 64. ``How can anyone be shocked?''
   New York City Schools Chancellor Dr. Richard Green suspended the
entire eight members of the District 9 board Wednesday saying he had
to ``take the unusual step of suspending the current school board
without having any knowledge about the long-term effects'' of a
grand jury probe into the allegations.
   The fence behind the South Bronx elementary school has gaping
holes. Shattered glass and assorted trash ring the playground. And
the local crack dealers will be back on Monday to greet the kids
after the Thanksgiving weekend.
   ``Every day, right there,'' said 11-year-old Carlos Ortiz, a
fourth-grader there, gesturing toward a street corner near the
school. ``I saw them this morning _ a lady and a man.''
   While the drug dealers worked the outside, Bronx District
Attorney Paul Gentile is investigating what went on inside the
school, where members of Community School Board No. 9 allegedly held
weekly Friday night cocaine and booze parties.
   A grand jury is also probing alleged bribery, extortion and theft
involving school boards throughout the Bronx. Gentile said Board 9
is ``the focal point'' of that probe.
   The board was unquestionably in trouble, officials said, whether
the charges are true or not. Part of the blame falls on the city's
school decentralization policy, which makes each of 32 district
boards autonomous with very few monitoring measures.
   School Board No. 9 failed to meet even those requirements,
officials said.
   It had failed to file mandatory annual reports with the Board of
Education since the 1984-5 school year, said board spokesman Frank
Sobrino. Minutes of the school board's scheduled monthly meetings
were requested by the Board of Education, but ``they haven't been
filing regularly,'' said Sobrino.
   Reading scores in the 9th _ with its 26,000 students and 34
schools in the predominately black and Hispanic area _ were the
fifth worst of the city's 32 school districts. State Sen. Israel
Ruiz said the charges of illegal activity by the board have been
``common knowledge for years.''
   While he couldn't provide an exact number, Sobrino said there
have been ``numerous complaints'' about Board No. 9. Gentile said
the allegations against the board have mushroomed in the past two
weeks since the arrest of one of its principals, Matthew Barnwell of
P.S. 53.
   Conditions at Barnwell's school are about the same as those at
P.S. 64 _ the school sits across from a vacant lot filled with
abandoned furniture, empty liquor bottles, trash bags and broken
glass. The area is so bad, residents of a neighboring nursing home
are kept inside virtually round-the-clock.
   Gentile warned the investigation would be a lengthy process
unlikely to produce any quick indictments or action.

<HEAD>Nemeth Pursues Change With Best Qualified People, Not Best
Connected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Western-oriented economist was elected
premier Thursday and Miklos Nemeth immediately declared he wants to
reform the economy with help from the best qualified people, not the
best connected.
   Parliament approved Nemeth, 40, to replace Communist Party leader
Karoly Grosz as head of government in a show of hands with 27
deputies voting against and 36 abstaining. There are 383 deputies.
   Acknowledging polite applause, Nemeth told parliament he would
continue Grosz' program of economic reform and austerity coupled
with political change.
   To ensure efficiency and make room for a growing trend toward
more pluralism, Nemeth said, the government need not be composed
solely of Communist Party members.
   ``Work must be based not on prestige, but on high professionalism
and moral impeccability,'' he said. ``Virtues should be the basis
for selection (to top posts) ... amid a democratic framework.''
   Hungary already has a non-communist president, Bruno F. Straub,
and several other officials like Nemeth have risen to senior posts
without decades of work in the party apparatus.
   His rival for the premiership, fellow Politburo member Reszo
Nyers, was elected minister of state for economic affairs.
   At 65, Nyers is one of the most experienced men in the
leadership. The father of Hungary's stalled economic reforms of the
1960s, he was removed from the Politburo when reform was slowed in
1974 but made it back to the ruling party body in May.
   Nyers told a news conference his goals did not differ from
Nemeth's.
   Reforms must be pushed through ``if we want to maintain our
credibility'' at home and abroad, he said.
   As the Communist Party's Central Committee secretary for
economics since June 1987, Nemeth helped prepare the reforms under
Grosz, who became premier almost 18 months ago and took over as
Communist Party leader in May.
   Grosz introduced Eastern Europe's first personal income and value
added taxes, as well as laws to increase the flow of hard currency
into Hungary by loosening restrictions on foreign ownership and
joint ventures.
   The unpopular measures aim to reduce the $17 billion foreign debt
and turn a stagnating economy into what Grosz calls a ``socialist
market economy.''
   Nemeth has not had a high profile in the increasing debate over
political reform in Hungary and the possibility of a multiparty
system under the new constitution due in 1990.
   He said Thursday he favored ``social pluralism from the grass
roots.''
   A former student and then professor at Budapest's prestigious
Karl Marx University of Economics, Nemeth also spent a year at
Harvard University on a visitor's program.
   Hungary must act as a bridge between East and West, he said.
   Both Nyers and Nemeth won the unanimous approval of the Communist
Party's ruling Central Committee on Wednesday.
   But things did not go so smoothly in parliament, where
traditionally docile proceedings have given way recently to debates
that reflect growing divisions in the countryside.
   The vote was delayed an hour by Zoltan Kiraly, an outspoken
deputy who said parliament should spend more time debating who
should replace Grosz.
   Grosz said Kiraly had ``a legitimate question'' and defended the
nominations, saying he initiated Nyers' appointment so the veteran
could bring his ``great work and skill in economic matters'' to
Nemeth's government.
   Kiraly eventually was overruled.

   Shirley Temple Black thinks she was more mature
as a child movie star than she is as a 60-year-old former ambassador.
   ``I was never as sophisticated and as grown up as when I was 12
to 14,'' she said in the current issue of Parade magazine. ``Ever
since, I've gotten younger.''
   The most rewarding part of that early career, she said, is ``the
cross-generation popularity of those movies. Just about everyone of
every age has the ability to enjoy my films.''
   Mrs. Black, a former ambassador to Ghana, works part-time at the
State Department, training new ambassadors for overseas assignments.
But she has bigger goal.
   ``I'd like to be director of the U.S. Information Agency,'' she
said. ``With my background in entertainment and government service,
I think I'd be good at it.''
   ``You may not know, but early in the Reagan years there was
speculation that Walter Cronkite would become USIA director and I
would be his deputy,'' she added. ``But this time, I'd (like to) be
the head and he'd be the deputy.''

<HEAD>Britain Introduces Legislation Aimed At Undermining IRA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government proposed laws Thursday to stiffen
prison sentences for terrorism, make it harder for the IRA to
finance operations and require candidates in Northern Ireland
elections to disavow violence.
   The measures were presented to Parliament the day after a man and
his granddaughter were killed in a bungled Irish Republican Army
bombing. They are virtually certain to pass in the 650-member House
of Commons, where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has a huge
101-seat majority.
   Her government suggested the anti-violence oath last year as a
means of undermining the IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, in
its attempt to win political legitimacy in Northern Ireland.
   At the heart of Sinn Fein ideology is support for what it calls
the IRA ``armed struggle'' and the government calls terrorism.
   Sinn Fein commands about one-third of the Roman Catholic vote in
the troubled province and won about 10 percent of the seats on 17 of
the province's 26 local authorities in May 1985 elections.
   ``There's nothing that we're trying to do here to stop people
standing at elections or to actually preclude a particular political
party,'' Northern Ireland Minister Richard Needham told a news
conference.
   ``Even if they (Sinn Fein) start by signing this declaration and
abide by the rules of the declaration, it at least stops the open
insulting, almost obscene advocacy of violence.''
   The law would permit prosecution and even removal of councilors
who publicly support the IRA's violent campaign to drive the British
from Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the
Irish Republic, which is overwhelmingly Catholic.
   Sinn Fein has said it will find a way around the ``declaration
against terrorism,'' which would apply to local government and
provincial assembly contests. It probably will take effect before
next May's municipal elections.
   An elected official who took the oath and then voiced support for
the outlawed IRA could be disqualified from office for five years
after successful prosecution.
   Although it applies to all candidates, the oath is designed
primarily as a weapon for Protestant council members, who object to
serving with IRA supporters.
   Under the proposed law, a court could disqualify a council member
``if his words or actions could reasonably be understood as
expressing support for, or approval of'' terrorism or the activities
of a banned organization.
   The law on prison sentences would require a prisoner to serve
two-thirds of his time instead of being eligible for parole at
midpoint in his term, as under current law. The Northern Ireland
Office says one-fifth of security offenders released in 1984
committed a new terrorist offense within two years.
   Provisions of the third measure limit banking secrecy and empower
courts to seize funds believed to be earned from racketeering
related to terrorism.
   Northern Ireland has been plagued by political and sectarian
violence since August 1969 and more than 2,700 people have been
killed. The IRA is outlawed in both Britain and Ireland.
   Last month, Britain banned broadcast interviews with members of
the IRA and 10 other militant Northern Ireland groups, Catholic and
Protestant. The government also plans to end the right of suspects
to remain silent under police interrogation.
   On Wednesday night, an IRA bomb meant to blow up a police station
killed a 67-year-old Catholic man and his granddaughter, 13, and
wounded eight other civilians.
   In a statement claiming responsibility, the IRA called the deaths
of Barney Lavery and Emma Donnelly ``tragic.'' It added: ``The IRA
has nothing to gain by the deaths of civilians and in fact has much
to lose in terms of support.''
   Police said Lavery had taken Emma out for an evening of bingo and
stopped his car to pick up an elderly pedestrian when the bomb
exploded outside the part-time police station in Benburb, 35 miles
west of Belfast.
   They said the station was unmanned and no security personnel were
hurt.

   Five Vietnam combat veterans are heading for
the Soviet Union to reassure some brother war veterans that their
fears, anger, sadness and depression are normal human reactions to
war.
   ``If just one person had assured me I was OK, that it was a
normal reaction, it would have made an incredible difference in my
life,'' Todd Brandoff said, recalling the five years he figures
Vietnam took from his life.
   The Soviet soldiers are not veterans of Vietnam, but of
Afghanistan _ the Soviet military men called ``Afhghantsi.'' Their
destination is Alma-Ata, a city of about 1 million almost on the
Chinese border and only about 500 miles northeast of Afghanistan.
   ``What we're attempting to do is, in a period of two weeks, try
to share with the Soviet veterans from Afghanistan what it's taken
us 20 to 25 years to learn about delayed stress and post-traumatic
stress,'' Brandoff said.
   The five men, all from Missoula, will be in a group of 30 who
will fly into Moscow on Monday to begin two weeks as guests of the
Soviet government and the men they hope to help. They are paying
$1,600 to $1,800 apiece to get to Moscow, but the Soviet government
will pay for their travel in the U.S.S.R., some 4,000 miles, and
they will stay in private homes.
   ``I think the Soviet people are anxious for this to take place,''
said another of the five, Steve Lohning, addictions therapist with
the Recovery Foundation.
   News reports about the Soviet Union's difficulties in Afghanistan
set the Missoula veterans musing about being able to talk to the
Afghantsi, Lohning recalled. Then they learned that such a trip was
being organized by Diana Glasgow of Earthstewards Network, based in
Bainbridge, Wash. She has guided 20 such trips to the Soviet Union
in the last three years, Brandoff said.
   ``We'll be talking about delayed stress and effects of the war
... on an apolitical basis,'' he said. ``We are men who were called
up by our countries to fight an unpopular war. That makes us their
brothers _ big brothers, because we have 20 years on 'em.
   ``The Soviets have not been spat on and despised, but in many
cases their parents still think they were in Afghanistan planting
trees.''
   The Soviets have no equivalent of our Veterans Administration,
Brandoff said.
   ``They don't have anything officially, as far as I know, an
agency of the government where they can go and say, `I'm stressed
out, having problems with my wife, drinking too much, taking drugs.''
   Brandoff, co-pilot of an assault helicopter, was wounded in an
ambush that shot down 12 of 14 helicopters in the flight, all in
about one minute. His helicopter managed to land, but it had 17
holes in it and Brandoff had seven, plus shrapnel wounds.
   Brandoff, a writer and salesman of industrial textiles, considers
himself fortunate to have survived as well as he did, despite seven
operations and years of depression and post-traumatic stress
symptoms.
   The trip to the Soviet Union is full of ironies. Brandoff says he
and some other veterans are sure they were wounded with Soviet-made
weapons. He is certain that some of the Afghantsi were wounded by
American-made weapons.
   Lohning paused when asked why he was willing to pay so much money
for this trip. He spoke of his occupation, of helping people deal
with pain and confusion, and of directions in his own life.
   ``I've got some skills,'' he said finally, ``and I think it's
time for people to start sharing what we've got instead of killing
people.
   ``I'm willing to pay the money to do that.''

   The Toyota Motor Corp. is negotiating with General
Motors on joint production of Toyota's one-ton truck in the United
States, a Toyota official said Thursday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was commenting
on a news report that Toyota plans to produce 100,000 of the trucks
annually, beginning in 1990 at the earliest, at a plant the two
companies operate in Fremont, Calif., in 1984.
   ``Dicussions (on small truck production) between Toyota and GM
are still underway,'' he said without elaborating.
   Kyodo News Service reported the two companies plan to rebuild the
idle GM plant at their joint venture New United Motor Manufacturing
Co. compound in Freemont, near San Francisco, at a cost of tens of
millions of dollars.
   Kyodo said Toyota has applied to the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District to increase the level of exhaust gas produced by
the plant.
   The Toyota official said the Freemont plant's application to the
air quality district ``was made to allow them more flexibility with
possible production expansion in the future. This doesn't signal a
decision on truck production there.''
   The Freemont plant produces 250,000 passenger cars a year, Kyodo
said.
   Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, sells about 300,000 small
trucks a year in the United States.

   French banks and the Soviet Union are preparing a
loan package, part of it made up of export credits guaranteed by the
French government, the finance minister said Thursday.
   The French credit package is expected to be signed during a
two-day visit by President Francois Mitterrand to Moscow that begins
Friday.
   Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, speaking to reporters, did not
specify the amount, although Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said in a
radio interview that loans of about $2 billion were being made
available to the Soviets.
   Dumas also said the loans would be linked to progress in
disarmament talks on conventional weapons in Europe, but he did not
spell out how the connection would be made.
   The French hope the credit package will boost economic
cooperation between the two countries. Several large business deals
are expected to be signed during the visit.
   France has been running a trade deficit with the Soviet Union
that in the first nine months of 1988 amounted to about $62 million.
   Beregovoy declined to give details on the credit package except
to say that the interest rates would be variable.
   France would be the fourth West European country to offer trade
credits to Moscow in recent weeks following similar packages signed
with Britain, Italy and West Germany.
   Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank which is lead manager for
the consortium of lending banks engineering the credit package,
declined to comment on Beregovoy's statement.

   President P.W. Botha's decision
to spare the lives of the ``Sharpeville Six'' earned him rare praise
from around the world, but his critics at home want further proof of
his good will.
   Several leading human rights activists Thursday demanded the
abolition of capital punishment. Other government opponents
suggested Botha acted out of expediency and called for him to free
political prisoners like Nelson Mandela and dismantle apartheid,
South Africa's legalized race separation.
   Across the political spectrum, there was agreement that Botha
made a politically astute move Wednesday when he commuted the death
sentences of 13 people.
   They included four white policemen convicted of killing
non-whites and the Sharpeville Six _ five black men and a woman
convicted of complicity in the killing of a black official during
1984 rent riots.
   ``The arbitrariness of the selection of those reprieved is
frightening,'' said Brian Currin, director of South Africa's Lawyers
for Human Rights Organization. ``Why should others, who do not
become political play balls, be less fortunate?''
   He commented after five convicted murderers were hanged at dawn
Thursday. Just before, two other condemned men were granted stays of
execution so clemency petitions could be considered.
   So far this year, 115 people including three whites have been
executed while Botha has reprieved 49 Death Row prisoners, the
Prison Service said. More than 200 people still await execution.
   The Rev. Stanley Mogoba, president of South Africa's Methodist
Church, said the clemency was ``one of the best Christmas presents I
can think of.''
   ``Mr. Botha has illustrated, in this statesmanlike act of
reprieve, that he too understands the Christian message of peace and
good will,'' Mogoba said.
   ``I call on him to extend this understanding to others, in
different ways, such as releasing political prisoners like Mandela
... and dismantling the heretical structures that prop up
apartheid,'' he added.
   The government showed further flexibility in Mandela's case
Thursday when Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said the 70-year-old
black leader won't be put back in prison after he recovers from
tuberculosis.
   Mandela will be moved to a ``suitable, comfortable and secure''
location from a private clinic where he is hospitalized, Coetsee
said in a statement.
   Mandela, head of the outlawed African National Congress, was
sentenced to life in prison for plotting sabotage against the white
minority government. He has refused to renounce violence in exchange
for his freedom.
   Prakash Diar, lawyer for the Sharpeville Six, was bitter that
Botha gave his clients long prison terms _ 18-25 years _ instead of
freeing them.
   Two of his clients ``believe that they would be better off if
they hanged rather than spending such long times in prison,'' Diar
said.
   Cape Town's Argus newspaper questioned whether ``premeditated,
cold-blooded murder'' by policemen should be equated with a crime
committed ``in the heat of a public upheaval.''
   One of the most negative reactions came from an official of the
South-West African People's Organization, the leftist guerilla
movement fighting to end South African rule over South-West Africa,
also known as Namibia.
   Nayuala Kapuka, SWAPO's chief representative in Zimbabwe, called
the reprieves a ``hoodwinking ploy'' to fool the international
community.
   They came barely 24 hours after another South African action was
welcomed internationally _ the acceptance of a Namibian peace plan.
   The Times of London linked the developments in an editorial
Thursday that said they ``suggest a new mood of flexibility in a
government whose chief characteristic has too often been
self-defeating intransigence.''

<TEXT>
   A strong, early dose of wintry weather with stiff
winds, snow and freezing temperatures Thursday was blamed for at
least five deaths in Italy.
   Snow fell on the Yugoslavian coast for the first time in a
decade. In Portugal, rain flooded scores of homes and two yachts
sank in rough seas off the coast.
   The harsh weather brought the first snowfall of the year to many
regions of Italy, from the Alps to the mountainous tip of the
peninsula in Calabria.
   Among four victims in northeastern Friuli region were two
teen-agers whose car skidded off a snow-covered road. A 14-year-old
boy was struck and killed by a car whose driver lost control in the
poor driving conditions. An elderly man was found dead in his car
which plunged into a ravine near Trieste.
   In Parma, an air force officer was killed when a military
transport vehicle overturned on a slickened highway and caught fire.
   Several cities, particularly in northern regions, have reported
extreme cold. In Alto Adige, a region bordering Austria, the
temperature plunged to 26 below zero. Snow piled as high as a foot
in higher altitudes, raising hopes of an early season for some ski
resort operators.
   Meteorologists said the cold weather was caused by a stalled high
pressure system which is blocking warmer, upper air currents.
   There also were transport problems in neighboring Yugoslavia,
where heavy snow and winds stalled traffic in some parts.
   Tanjug state news agency reported snow fell along the Adriatic
coast for the first time in 10 years and stalled traffic in other
parts.
   The unseasonal cold spell left 60 villages in Tutin and Novi
Pazar regions of central Yugoslavia without power, Tanjug said.
   Record low temperatures were recorded in northern Slovenia
republic, ranging from minus 2 degrees at Planica, on the border
with Italy, to 10 below in the capital, Ljubljana.
   Snow drifts of up to three feet piled on the Kopaonik mountain, a
fashionable skiing resort.
   Hurricane-force winds uprooted trees and swept away roofs in the
villages of Dragas and Globocica in the Kosovo province on the
border to Albania, the Vecernje Novosti newspaper said.
   Tanjug said for the first time in 10 years snow fell on Split, a
mid-Adriatic city port, and in Dubrovnik's hinterland further south.
   Two British yachts sank off Portugal's southern Algarve coast as
storms lashed the popular tourism region, the Portuguese Navy said
Thursday. All seven people on board the two yachts escaped the
sinkings late Wednesday.
   More than 60 homes were reported flooded in the small town of
Vila do Bispo 14 miles west of the port city of Lagos, according to
the Portuguese news agency Lusa.

   Jailed black leader Nelson Mandela
won't be returning to his prison upon his recovery from tuberculosis
but will be moved to a ``suitable, comfortable and secure''
location, the justice minister said Thursday.
   The 70-year-old Mandela, head of the outlawed African National
Congress and the country's best-known black leader, has been
recovering from tuberculosis since August in a private clinic in a
suburb of Cape Town.
   The statement by Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee did not give any
details on when Mandela would leave the hospital, where he would be
taken, or what restrictions he would face.
   It strongly suggested, however, that the government was trying to
gradually release Mandela, whose freedom has been the object of a
worldwide campaign.
   Mandela's health ``has improved to such an extent that should the
improvement continue it will eventually no longer be necessary to
care for him in a clinic,'' Coetsee said.
   ``When the time arrives he will be transferred to suitable,
comfortable and secure living accommodation, where he will be able
to receive members of his family more freely and on a continual
basis,'' Coetsee added.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, said in a statement issued by family
attorney Ismail Ayob that she ``attaches no significance to the
statement.''
   ``Mr. Mandela still remains a prisoner of the South African
government and there is no indication of any imminent release,'' the
statement said.
   Earlier Thursday, President P.W. Botha reportedly made a
statement similar to Coetsee. U.S. evangelist Pat Robertson said
Botha told him Mandela would not return to prison from the clinic
but might be kept under guard for his own protection.
   Robertson, a TV preacher and former Republican presidential
candidate, told reporters he and Botha had spoken about Mandela
during a meeting at government headquarters in Pretoria.
   Part of the discussion was taped for broadcast in the United
States on Friday, but Robertson did not say if the Mandela
discussion would be included.
   Standing on the steps outside Botha's office, Robertson said the
president had just told him Mandela ``will not be returned to
prison, but I did not get any indication he would be released.
   ``I believe President Botha was quite concerned, as he expressed
it to me, that there's a real possibility that Mr. Mandela might be
assassinated by people either to the left wing or the right wing of
the country, and he doesn't want that to happen,'' Robertson said.
   ``He (Botha) said he did not feel that (Mandela) would be
returned to prison but would be placed in some other type of _ he
didn't use the term `protective custody,' those are my words _ but
some other environment after he finishes his stay in the clinic.''
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962. He is serving a life sentence
for conspiring with other leaders of the African National Congress
to wage an anti-government sabotage campaign.
   In early August, Mandela was transferred from the Pollsmoor
Prison to the state-run Tygerberg Hospital for treatment of
tuberculosis. Since Aug. 31 he had been recuperating in the clinic.
   In 1985, Mandela rejected a government offer to set him free if
he renounced violence. Recently, Botha has hinted that Mandela could
be released without meeting this condition, but the government has
made no definitive statement on the matter.
   The reports Thursday appeared to support a statement made in
Washington by South African Ambassador Piet Koornhof that Mandela
``is no longer in prison.'' Koornhof reportedly said Mandela was in
the process of being returned to society and felt he would be
released ``sooner rather than later.''
   Robertson is in South Africa meeting political leaders and
producing shows for his Christian Broadcasting Network. He said he
hoped to meet Sunday with Mandela's wife, Winnie, before a religious
rally in the black township of Soweto.
   Robertson said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu had refused to
meet with him. Tutu is a former Nobel Peace Prize-winner and a
leading opponent of apartheid, the system under which South Africa's
26 million black majority ahs no say in national affairs.

<HEAD>Food Costs High, More State Subsidies to Come</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite heavy subsidies, food in
Czechoslovakia costs 2{ times more than in West Germany in relative
terms, the state news agency CTK reported Thursday.
   Food costs, especially in the lower-income group of the
population, ``represent a decisive component of the family budget,''
said CTK, quoting a recent survey conducted by several Czechoslovak
research institutes.
   ``It turns out that especially in young families with several
children, the needs of nutrition are not fully met, especially as
far as nutrients are concerned,'' the report said. It added that the
problem also affects ``almost one third of all pensioners.''
   In Czechoslovakia, retail food prices are 2{ times higher than in
West Germany, 1.8 times higher than in East Germany and 1.1 times
above those in Austria, according to the survey. CTK said it was
based on the number of working hours needed to purchase 2.2 pounds
of given products such as meat, fruit or vegetables.
   Foodstuffs in Czechoslovakia are subsidized heavily by the
government.
   In 1986, the state food production, including tobacco products,
yielded a $4 billion profit, while subsidies totaled $2.2 billion,
CTK said.
   ``It is true that some foodstuffs are subsidized, and this
concerns mainly milk and milk products ... but on the whole the
state does not lose money in food production,'' the agency said.
   In anticipation of the restructuring of wholesale prices in the
economy on Jan. 1, 1989, and after a partial ban on food exports and
over-the-counter sale curbs, popular fears of retail food price
increases have led to panic buying in some shops.
   Vaclav Grametbauer of the Czechoslovak Finance Ministry was
quoted by the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo Thursday as saying
state subsidies will keep food prices at current levels in 1989.
   Subsidies are likely to equal the state's entire income from the
turnover tax on foodstuffs, including higher profits from alcoholic
drinks, cigarettes and coffee.

   Students and teachers of 15 universities
and colleges held protest strikes Thursday demanding reforms, higher
subsidies and wider autonomy for higher education, the state news
agency MTI reported.
   One government official went on record as promising some
financial improvement, but sweeping reform may take years.
   The two-day boycott, which began Wednesday, was the latest in a
series of protest actions on higher education in Hungary.
   In the spring, students first spoke of crisis symptoms in
university education at a ``student parliament'' in Veszprem.
   In September, students at Szeged and Pecs universities launched a
warning strike. The Szeged students presented demands to the
Ministry of Education and Culture of radical improvement of the
financial status of universities, the protection of the real value
of scholarships, and an improvement of living and working conditions
of students and teachers.
   In its reply, the ministry indicated that between three and five
years might be required ``to overcome the difficulties,'' MTI said.
   The students reportedly rejected several points of the
ministerial reply and decided to stage the two-day strike to express
their dissatisfaction.
   Andras Rupp, a senior government official Thursday was quoted by
the Communist Party daily newspaper Nepszabadsag as promising that
the higher education budget would reach $256 million in 1989.
   A higher education development fund set up this year will be
increased in 1989, Rupp said, and the sum allocated for social
allowances and scholarships will be raised by 10 percent.
   Rupp reportedly promised that teachers' salaries would be
increased by 6 percent, rejecting a demand for a 40 percent
increase. Hungary's current annual inflation rate is about 18
percent.

   Retiring Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., has
been elected to the board of the National Taxpayers Union and will
continue sponsoring his ``Golden Fleece Award'' in the new role, the
group announced Thursday.
   Proxmire did not seek re-election and will become a former
senator when the new Congress is sworn in next month.
   ``We are delighted to welcome Senator Proxmire to the NTU
board,'' said Jim Davidson, chairman of the not-for-profit gadfly
organization. ``His integrity and long-standing dedication to the
rights of taxpayers is well known and we are honored to have him
associated with the work of NTU.''
   Davidson said that starting in January, Proxmire will supervise
his monthly ``Golden Fleece Award'' in cooperation with the
Taxpayers Union.
   ``I am pleased to join the board of NTU, which I regard as the
most effective lobby in Washington working for the benefit of the
general taxpaying public,'' Proxmire said in a statement distributed
by the organization.
   Proxmire, who was in the Senate for 32 years, started giving out
his monthly ``Golden Fleece Award'' in 1975 for what he termed the
``biggest example of ridiculous, ironic, or wasteful spending'' by a
government agency.
   The NTU, which calls itself a ``taxpayer-advocacy organization,''
was founded in 1969 and claims 150,000 members.

<TEXT>
   A monument depicting Austria's shame and
suffering in World War II was unveiled Thursday and served as a
somber reminder of Hitler's persecution of the Jews.
   More than 1,000 people gathered in and around Albertina Square
behind the Opera House for the inauguration of the monument by
sculptor Alfred Hrdlicka.
   The most controversial figure in one of several scenes depicted
is that of a Jew scrubbing the pavement.
   It recalls how the Nazis made Vienna Jews scrub streets clean of
anti-Nazi slogans with toothbrushes after Hitler annexed his native
Austria to Germany in 1938. Crowds of cheering Austrians often
looked on.
   Chief Rabbi Paul Chaim Eisenberg said the bronze figure would
remind Austrians of their past, which often is an uncomfortable
topic to the many who see themselves only as Hitler's victims.
   ``If you stand still, shaken, before this monument, then that can
be atonement for those who walked unmoved past the living Jews
washing the streets then,'' Eisenberg said.
   Thursday's ceremony was the last of many events this year
recalling the annexation and the attacks on Jews by Nazi thugs in
November 1938 that began the Holocaust.
   The anniversary has produced mixed emotions, reflecting Austria's
dual role as victim and accomplice of the Nazis.
   Controversy about President Kurt Waldheim's World War II service
as a German army officer has been an important element in the
observance and he played little part in the memorial events.
   Waldheim has been accused of committing war crimes while he was
an intelligence officer in the Balkans and denies the allegations.
   An international panel of historians determined that Waldheim was
in areas where atrocities were committed, knew of them and did
nothing to stop them. The historians said they found no direct
evidence that he committed crimes, but left the question of guilt
open.
   Erika Weinzierl, head of Austria's Action against Anti-Semitism
campaign, said Thursday the monument ``challenges us to remember the
darkest epoch of our history.''
   As she spoke, a few dozen people in the crowd chanted inaudible
slogans and knelt on the pavement, scrubbing it like the Jews of 50
years ago.
   They tossed leaflets into the crowd saying ``the Fuehrer has
gone,'' but anti-Semitism and persecution of other minorities
remains. Some of the dozens of policemen guarding Thursday's
ceremony were seen detaining at least two people.
   The monument, which will not be complete until next year, has a
``Gate of Violence'' opening on the figure of the crouching Jew.
Farther on, Orpheus arises from the underworld as a symbol of Art
overcoming the forces of darkness.
   Hundreds of Austrians lost their lives in a 1945 bombing raid on
a house that stood on the site of Albertina Square and their remains
are buried under the park-like, triangular area.
   It also has a pillar bearing pats of the declaration of
independence made by non-Nazi politicians April 27, 1945, just
before the war ended.
   Hrdlicka's monument cost about $900,000 and has been a subject of
argument since it was commissioned in 1983. Many conservative
politicians boycotted the ceremony, which was attended by Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky, Mayor Helmut Zilk and leaders of the small Jewish
community.

   Two members of the British rock group Pink Floyd
arrived in Moscow Thursday en route to watch a spaceship blast off
with their latest album aboard.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Pink Floyd's Dave
Gilmour and Nick Mason would accompany President Francois Mitterrand
of France to observe the Saturday launch from the Cosmodrome at
Baikonur in Soviet Central Asia.
   The flight will be manned by a joint French-Soviet crew.
Mitterrand is expected in Moscow Friday.
   Tass said Gilmour intends to find out whether he can make a
flight aboard a Soviet space craft but that for now ``only his music
will go.''
   It said a cassette of the group's latest recording was given to
the Soyuz-7 crew and will be left aboard the orbiting space station
Mir for the enjoyment of the Soviet cosmonauts who have been living
in space.
   Pink Floyd's move into space came after the cosmonauts told a
news conference they enjoyed relaxing to the band's music.
   The group's promoters immediately sent a copy of Pink Floyd's
latest album to Moscow. It was weighed, disinfected and put in
quarantine for inclusion on the flight.
   Pink Floyd's album ``The Dark Side of the Moon'' is one of the
biggest selling records ever made. The album bound for space, ``The
Delicate Sound of Thunder,'' is a recording of a Pink Floyd concert.
   Alexander Dunaev, head of the Soviet commercial space agency
Glavkosmos, had said the visit to the launch site was turned down.
He said the group was already getting enough publicity from sending
its album into space.
   But EMI Records, which handles Pink Floyd, said there was an
invitation to the launch and other preliminary events, and Gilmour
left Heathrow Airport saying: ``I was offered this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be present at a launch and I
thought I would be crazy to turn it down.''
   He added: ``I am hoping to record the launch so it may turn up on
a future Pink Floyd record.''
   Gilmour joked: ``I would go with them (the cosmonauts) if they
let me. I'd love to go. I might try to bash one of them on the head
and take his place.''

   Normally, Krista Wallach brings babies into the
world as an obstetrical nurse. Thursday, she moonlighted as an
inflation specialist, giving birth to a giant balloon in Macy's 62th
annual Thanksgiving Day Parade.
   ``Today, I'm delivering a bird,'' said Wallach, whose
authoritative orange-gloved hands directed the handlers of Big Bird,
a 67-foot tall, 29-foot wide helium-filled replica of the ``Sesame
Street'' character.
   The volunteer handlers were wearing yellow jump suits with Big
Bird spelled out in alphabet blocks on their backs. Their beaked
yellow cowls were topped by multicolored-wool caps.
   They were an enthusiastic lot as they geared up for the start of
the nationally televised parade.
   Wallach and John Hornstein, Big Bird's balloon captain, pranced
about giving last minute instructions, Wallach waving her hands and
Hornstein doing dance steps on occasion.
   But who was in charge, Hornstein with his title or Wallach with
her whistle?
   ``I'm always telling them what to do,'' laughed Wallach, who
outranks Hornstein seven years to three on the balloon patrol.
   The balloon volunteers, whose main qualification is that they
weigh more than 150 pounds, got written instructions in the mail
from parade organizers and then showed up Thursday morning.
   With Big Bird up and ready to go, the gang sang ``Happy
Birthday'' to volunteer Betsy Lynch, who works at Macy's in
Stamford, Conn., and then went to work.
   At 8:45, Hornstein said: ``Everybody, eyes forward.'' Just before
the 9 a.m. start, he was hitting high fives when all seemed ready.
   ``All right, wish Garfield good luck,'' Hornstein said to the
troops. As they obliged, Wallach shouted: ``But who's the best
balloon?'' The troops razzed the competition.
   Moments later, it was 9 a.m., shots were fired and the parade was
on.
   The celebrities included Joyce Brothers, who rode a goose and was
traveling incognito in her Mother Goose outfit; Keshia Knight
Pulliam, the youngest star of ``The Cosby Show''; Olympic gold
medalist Carl Lewis, who rode on the Marvel comic book float with
the Hulk, the Silver Surfer and Captain America; the famous
chronicler of the rich, Robin Leach, and the Four Tops.
   The stars and their coteries were carried on two dozen massive
floats, accompanied by 14 marching bands, hundreds of clowns and 400
cheerleaders from across the country.

   A man killed his girlfriend with a knife Thursday,
pushed her 6-year-old daughter out a fourth floor window, then
jumped to his death, authorities said. The child survived because a
passer-by broke her fall.
   Walter Falsone, 32, fell straight to the pavement and died,
police said. The child was in critical condition at a local hospital.
   ``I tried to grab the little girl, but she came down too fast,''
said 49-year-old Benedetto Masia, a repairman who broke the fall of
Valentina Bonacquisti. ``She hit my arm and then fell on the
sidewalk.''
   Police said Falsone and Tiziana Bonacquisti, 27, apparently had a
fight because Ms. Bonacquisti wanted to end their relationship.
   Ms. Bonacquisti was found stabbed to death with a kitchen knife.
Falsone's body had nine stab wounds.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said Falsone recently had suffered a
nervous breakdown.

   A woman who died while a fugitive on credit
card charges was honored at her funeral with a large floral
arrangement in the shape of an American Express Gold Card.
   Delores Ranko's name was on the card, and the expiration date was
``never.''
   Ms. Ranko, a member of a self-described gypsy family, was in the
Montgomery County Detention Center in Rockville last June awaiting
trial on theft charges when a judge released her on a personal bond
for cancer treatment.
   She got into a taxicab outside the jail June 6 and was never seen
again. Ms. Ranko, 46, who also used the names Delores Walker,
Delores Mangine, Delores Poplis, Maria Ranko and Mary Laser, eluded
authorities until she died four months later in Atlanta.
   ``Why they chose a credit card, I'll never know,'' said Richard
Clark, funeral director of Vista Funeral Home in Hialeah, Fla.,
where the funeral was held. But it may have been a fitting sendoff
from a family that police say swindled banks, credit card companies
and insurance companies out of more than $200,000.
   The 40-member family used false documents to defraud businesses
in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Tennessee, Florida and
Louisiana in addition to Maryland, authorities said.

   State investigators examined a carnival
ride Thursday that partially collapsed while in operation and killed
a teen-ager at the Broward County Fair.
   The fair's other rides and shows were operating as usual.
   One of six arms of the whirling ``Giant Octopus'' or ``Spider''
ride broke apart and crashed to the ground Wednesday evening,
authorities said. Each arm supported four cars, and about 40 people
were in the cars that fell nearly 10 feet, authorities said. At
least seven people were injured.
   Wallace Rich, chief of the state Bureau of Fairs and Expositions,
and deputy George Kolias were conducting the investigation.
   Investigators believe the dead girl was in a car connected to
another arm and was struck by the falling part of the machine.
   ``It was going faster than usual, really spinning fast, and then
all of the sudden it started shaking, and the wires got caught
between one another and then the cubes crashed to the ground,'' said
Heather Humphrey, 13, who was not injured.
   ``I turned around and looked, and a girl had her head thrown back
and there was blood all over the place,'' said Jennifer Hopp, 13.
   Some passengers were stranded above ground and were helped out of
the cars by other fairgoers, police said.
   The fair began Nov. 16 and will close Sunday.
   ``The fair is pretty safe,'' Hallandale Mayor Sonny Rosenberg
said. ``Unfortunately, these things sometimes happen. The fair will
continue. Unfortunately, we had a fatality, and that's tragic.''
   Authorities said Christy Schafale, 17, from Cooper City, was dead
of head injuries on arrival at Humana Hospital-Biscayne in Miami.
   Police said at least seven people sought medical and one was
hospitalized in satisfactory condition.

<TEXT>
   A river-rafting guide wounded by snipers who
killed one person said he initially thought nothing of the distant
gunfire he heard while taking a couple down the Rio Grande.
   ``That wasn't unusual,'' Jim Burr said of Saturday's attack. ``In
the past, it hasn't been a cause of concern.''
   He said hunters and people ``just shooting'' have used the area
before.
   One of Burr's passengers, Jamie Heffley, also was wounded; Mrs.
Heffley's husband, Michael, was killed while trying to shield her.
   Burr, 36, said Wednesday that even when they were first fired on,
he didn't think the snipers were seriously trying to hit them.
   ``When I got hit I realized they weren't kidding,'' he said.
   Burr, a guide with the Terlingua-based Far Flung Adventures, was
shot in the thigh. He remained hospitalized in Alpine in stable
condition. Mrs. Heffley, of Eastland, was in stable condition in an
Abilene hospital.
   U.S. and Mexican authorities are searching for the snipers, but
have not made any arrests.
   The three were rafting through the Colorado Canyon area when the
snipers opened fire from atop 300-foot bluffs on the Mexican side of
the border.
   ``At the beginning of the incident, after I got shot, I started
hollering at them and running down the river. I'm hollering `There's
no money on the boat. Please don't shoot! No more! No more!''' he
said.
   ``They were hollering something back but in the distance it all
got wadded up. But I think it was Spanish,'' he said.
   ``As far as I can tell, it was totally without motive,'' Burr
said. ``They didn't steal anything. They didn't come down to the
boat.''

<HEAD>Prospect of Orthodox in Government Spurs Draft Evasion Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prospect of ultra-Orthodox religious parties
joining the government sparked debate among former generals Thursday
over charges that some possible Cabinet ministers would encourage
draft dodging.
   The issue arose from deferments from military service given
students in yeshivas, or Jewish seminaries, and reports that
Orthodox parties may ask to widen the deferments as a price for
joining a coalition government.
   Thirty-five top reserve officers from both left and right signed
a petition accusing religious party leaders of being ``actively
against army service.''
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, himself a reserve general,
accused signers of mixing army duty and politics and called the
petition a ``dangerous and serious development'' in an interview
Thursday on army radio.
   One signer, reserve Gen. Meir Zorea, challenged Sharon on the
same station.
   Zorea said of the religious leaders:
   ``They want to send our sons to war and keep their sons at home.
Is there a difference between their blood and ours?''
   The deferment practice already has stirred anger in a country
where nearly all 18-year-old Jewish men and women go into military
service as a sacred duty.
   The petition was sent Wednesday to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and was printed Thursday in three major Israeli newspapers.
   Shamir rejected it, said his spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir. He said
Shamir understood the signers' motives, but would pursue efforts to
build a government with three ultra-Orthodox parties.
   The petition said the signers were fearful ``about the intention
to form a government in which 20 percent of its components aid and
abet evasion of army duty by yeshiva students.''
   ``We are fearful of the dimensions of evasion and the dangers of
it being widened and deepened.''
   It expressed ``concern for the moral and educational implications
of having many ministers and deputy ministers active in the
government against army service and against devotion to the defense
of the State of Israel.''
   Former military commanders in the occupied territories and
Lebanon were among the signers.
   ``I want to make very clear to my colleagues, we are embarking on
a very dangerous path,'' Sharon said. ``Today it is one reason and
tomorrow it could be another reason why army personnel will try to
determine who should be a Cabinet minister.''
   Political sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the
ultra-Orthodox parties may gain five Cabinet ministries.
   Shamir's Likud bloc won 40 seats in the 120-member parliament in
Nov. 1 elections and the Labor Party won 39. Shamir seeks support
from small religious parties to govern.
   Religious parties worked out an arrangement after Israel's
founding in 1948 for seminary students to postpone army duty. The
number deferred amounts to up to 20,000 men a year.
   Ultra-Orthodox leaders argue that religious study is as crucial
to the survival of the Jewish people as serving in the army.
   Nine legislators from right-wing and Orthodox parties meanwhile
said in a bill submitted Thursday that any soldier or civilian who
violates standing regulations on opening fire ``for security
reasons'' should be pardoned.
   Army radio said the bill came in response to pressure from Jewish
settlers confronted with the nearly yearlong Palestinian uprising in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in which 317 Palestinians and
11 Israelis have died.
   Standing orders allow troops to fire only in event of danger to
life. Settlers can use firearms only as a last resort.

<HEAD>Three Accused of Helping Banker Flee in Greek Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor charged a leading businessman
Thursday with helping a banker flee Greece in his private jet during
a major scandal, and the government said it asked the United States
to extradite the fugitive.
   The scandal has shaken Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist
government, which was accused of initially hesitating to investigate
charges involving misuse of hundreds of millions of dollars in bank
funds. Two Cabinet ministers have already been forced to resign.
   Athens District Attorney Yannis Gavrilis accused Argyris
Saliarelis of allowing banker and publisher George Koskotas to leave
Greece aboard Saliarelis' Lear jet on Nov. 6. Two pilots were
charged Thursday with concealing a criminal and helping him escape.
   Saliarelis reportedly said his private jet was used without his
knowledge.
   U.S. agents arrested the 34-year-old Koskotas in Bedford, Mass.,
on Wednesday night shortly after he arrived at a small airport.
   Koskotas, former chairman of the Bank of Crete and now wanted for
fraud and embezzlement in Greece, was in Brazil before flying to
America.
   The Greek government announced Thursday it asked U.S. authorities
to extradite Koskotas to face charges of misusing over $300 million
of bank funds.
   News media said earlier that several ministers and senior
socialist party officials were involved with Koskotas in illegal
money transfers abroad.

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin indicated Thursday it is open to
compromise on proposed constitutional changes that provoked
accusations of an attempt by Moscow to usurp power from the 15
Soviet republics.
   Tass said ``it was noted'' by the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo ``that nationwide debates on draft laws on changes to the
constitution and on elections of people's deputies of the U.S.S.R.,
which are drawing to a close, have attested to a widely shared
public interest in these matters.''
   ``Suggestions that have come in from working people make it
possible to substantially improve the bills (and) reflect public
opinion in them more fully,'' said the report by the official news
agency.
   The Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, is to meet Tuesday
to consider constitutional amendments that would establish a Council
of People's Deputies, which in turn would elect a full-time
legislature and a president with enhanced powers.
   One republic, Estonia, denounced changes that would centralize
power and declared its own ``sovereignty'' in all but defense and
foreign affairs, claiming the power to reject national laws.
   Authorities have mounted considerable opposition to the Baltic
republic's declaration, but some republics and a parliamentary
commission studying the amendments have recommended concessions.
   In Tbilisi, capital of the southern republic of Georgia, several
thousand demonstrators were reported to have gathered Thursday to
protest the amendments.
   Members of a grassroots Lithuanian political group arrived in
Moscow with a petition to the Supreme Soviet demanding sovereignty
for their republic. They claimed it bore 1.8 million signatures.
   Lithuania's legislature balked at pressure from activists for a
``declaration of sovereignty'' similar to Estonia's and the
legislature of the other Baltic republic, Latvia, also stopped short
of declaring autonomy.
   The three Baltic republics were independent between the world
wars but the Soviet Union annexed them in 1940 by agreement with
Nazi Germany.
   There have been indications the Supreme Soviet will declare
Estonia's actions unconstitutional, which could force a showdown
with the tiny republic.
   According to Tass, the executive body of the Byelorussian
leglislature said Estonia's actions ``contradict the constitution of
the U.S.S.R., are at odds with the fundamental principles underlying
the Soviet socialist federation and do not contribute to
strengthening the integral Soviet multinational state and furthering
the perestroika reform drive.''
   It approved the ``basic provisions'' of the proposed amendments,
Tass said, but the dispatch gave no indication whether it expressed
reservations about particular sections or recommended changes.
   Several other legislative bodies also have criticized the
Estonian declaration.
   Perestroika is the name Mikhail S. Gorbachev, president and
Communist Party chief, gives to his program of economic and social
reform.

   Candy and flowers are all right for some
folks, but Providenza Imburgia's children salute their 93-year-old
matriarch every day, year round, on a bus-stop bench.
   ``When your mother gets up in years, what can you do? She's
already got everything she needs,'' said son Joseph Imburgia, 64.
   These days, Mrs. Imburgia's bench displays a family tree _
children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren _ 46 names descended
from Providenza and her husband, Dominic, a fruit peddler who died
in 1949. They came to America from Palermo, Sicily, and married in
1913.
   ``It's wonderful!'' Mrs. Imburgia says of the bench.
   In the past, the bench has carried loving messages like
``Happiness to all, and to Providenza Imburgia,'' or ``Happy
Mother's Day to all mothers, especially Providenza Imburgia.''
   Thousands of people walk or drive past the advertising bench
daily, many en route, by bus or on foot, to the nearby elevated
train station.
   The bench was a 1982 inspiration, when Mrs. Imburgia's children
ran out of birthday ideas.
   ``We thought about skywriting, or renting a neon `Happy Birthday'
sign with a generator to put in front of her house, but we decided
on the bench because it was more permanent,'' said Joseph.

   A winter-like weather system spread snow over the Rockies on
Thursday and a second storm dumped rain and snow along the northern
Pacific Coast.
   A low pressure system over Colorado with a cold front trailing to
the southwest affected the central and northern Rockies. Cold air
behind the front held afternoon temperatures in the 30s and 40s.
   Northern Utah got heavy, wet snow that apparently contributed to
scattered power outages. In the Wasatch Front range, Snowbird ski
resort reported 16 inches of new snow, Alta had 15 inches and Park
City had 12.
   Much of southeastern Idaho got 1 to 2 inches of snow, and 2
inches fell at Boise during the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m. EST.
   Light snow fell over parts of Wyoming. The heaviest snowfall in
north-central Wyoming was 6 to 8 inches at Bear Lodge and Arrowhead
in the Big Horn Mountains. Five inches of new snow was reported at
Dayton and 4{ inches fell at Story.
   Strong, gusty wind blew ahead of the low pressure system, with a
gust to 55 mph at Guadalupe Pass in Texas, and 70 mph near Fort
Collins, Colo.
   Another low pressure system approaching the Pacific Northwest
spread moist air over the northern and central Pacific Coast.
   Rain fell along the coasts of northern California and western
Oregon. Heavy snow fell over parts of the Cascade range, with a foot
over the Santiam Pass in Oregon.
   A heavy snow warning was issued for Oregon's Cascades and
Siskiyou, a winter storm warning was posted for Oregon's Coast
range, and snow advisories were issued for eastern Oregon, the
Cascades of Washington, northeastern California, the northern Sierra
Nevadas, and mountain areas near Lake Tahoe.
   A series of storms that began Tuesday blanketed the Sierra Nevada
with up to 4 feet of new snow. ``This will be one of the best, if
not the best, Thanksgiving weekends we've ever had,'' Squaw Valley
spokesman Bill Jensen said. Heavenly Valley opened last Saturday,
the earliest since 1973.
   In the Atlantic, weakening tropical storm Keith blew through the
British island of Bermuda, where no major problems were reported,
and began disappearing into a northern storm front, forecasters
said. Its sustained wind speed was 45 mph, down from the 65 mph wind
it had when it cross Florida late Tuesday and early Wednesday.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 19
degrees at Yellowstone National Park to 82 degrees at Laredo, Texas.
Thursday morning's low was zero at Ely, Nev.
   For Friday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
Louisiana across the middle Mississippi Valley. Light snow was
forecast over western Minnesota. Widespread rain was forecast over
the central and northern Pacific Coast with snow inland and at
higher elevations.
   Highs in the 20s and 30s were predicted over the northern
Intermountain region between the Sierra Nevada and Rockies, the
northern and central Rockies, the northern Plains, northwestern
Minnesota and northern Maine; in the 40s and 50s from the northern
Pacific Coast across the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah, the
southern Rockies, northwestern Texas and Oklahoma, the central
Plains, the lower Missouri Valley and the Great Lakes to the
northern and middle Atlantic Coast; in the 80s over south-central
Texas and the southern half of the Florida Peninsula; and in the 60s
and 70s over the remainder of the nation.

   A weakening Tropical Storm Keith blew through the
British island of Bermuda on Thursday and began disappearing into a
northern stormfront, forecasters said.
   As a tropical storm, Keith crossed Florida's midsection late
Tuesday and Wednesday with winds of 65 mph and slashing rains. Lower
Atlantic temperatures chilled it down to 45 mph sustained winds by
Thursday afternoon, although there were gusts of 64 mph.
   ``It's now extratropical. It's expected to merge with a big
wintertime storm to the northeast and we will lose track of its
identity,'' said forecaster Bob Case at the National Hurricane
Center.
   At 5 p.m. EST Thursday, the center of Keith's remnants was near
latitude 35.0 north and longitude 64.0 west, or about 200 miles
north-northeast of Bermuda, and it was moving north-northeast at 40
mph.
   No major problems were reported on Bermuda after gale-force winds
and rains swept across with Keith.
   In Florida, it left large sections of shoreline eroded in the
Sarasota and St. Petersburg Beach areas and on the island of Captiva.
   At its worst, the storm was blamed for heavy winds and rain that
flipped over a truck near Tampa Bay area. Tornadoes spawned by the
storm damaged some 25 mobile homes in Lake County, in the state's
midsection, and in Tampa, and flooding was reported in low-lying
areas in the storm's path.
   The storm also was blamed for the derailment of 34 cars of a
cargo train Wednesday near Lakeland because of a railroad bed washed
out by rain.

   More deaths were reported Thursday in a renewed
outbreak of ethnic rioting in Azerbaijan despite the deployment of
Soviet troops and tanks to put down violence in three cities,
officials said.
   Hundreds of ethnic Armenians were said to be fleeing the republic
of Azerbaijan for their adjacent homeland. Troops reportedly used
helicopters and trucks to evacuate women and children from one
troubled area after the worst outbreak of violence since the first
days of ethnic disturbances in the Soviet south in February.
   Musa Mamedov, chief of the information department of the
Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry, said Thursday night that reports from
the city of Kirovabad were sketchy but that several people had been
killed in the latest outburst.
   ``There were more outbreaks of violence,'' Mamedov said, speaking
by telephone from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku. ``There are
victims, deaths.''
   Tass, in a report read on the nightly news program ``Vremya,''
blamed the deteriorating situation on ``irresponsible nationalistic
elements'' and acknowledged there was fighting between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis.
   Meanwhile, in the neighboring republic of Georgia, several
thousand demonstrators were reported to have gathered in the capital
of Tbilisi to protest proposed amendments to the Soviet Constitution
that have prompted complaints the Kremlin is trying to monopolize
power and weaken the legislatures of the 15 constituent republics.
   Also, members of a grassroots Lithuanian political organization
arrived in Moscow to deliver a petition to the Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, demanding sovereignty for their republic. They claimed
the petition bore the signatures of 1.8 million citizens of the
once-independent Baltic republic.
   In Kirovabad on Tuesday, mobs killed three soldiers, and 126
people were injured, according to Azerbaijani and Soviet officials.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told
reporters in Moscow that tanks and troops had been sent to
Kirovabad, Baku and a third Azerbaijani city, Nakhivechan, to
restore order. A 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew had been imposed, he said.
   In Nakhichevan, border troops evacuated at least 500 Armenian
women and children to Armenia, using ``helicopters, trucks and
anything else they could find,'' said Boris Kufaryan, senior editor
of Armenia's official Armenpress news agency. ``The men stayed
behind to defend their homes.''
   Kufaryan, speaking by telephone from the Armenian capital of
Yerevan, said more than 1,700 Armenians who fled from Azerbaijan in
recent days had registered as refugees in his republic with an
official commission created to help them.
   Nakhichevan is the capital of a region of the same name that
belongs to Azerbaijan but is separated from the main part of the
republic by Armenia. According to the 1970 census, 190,000
Azerbaijanis share the region with 6,000 Armenians.
   The two groups, divided by religion, language and national
heritage, have a long history of ethnic rivalry. Armenians are
predominantly Christian and Azerbaijanis are predominantly Moslem.
   In Kirovabad, frightened Armenians formed an emergency committee
to send their women and children to Armenia, Arpenay Popoyan, wife
of Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan, said from Yerevan. She said
they asked the military authorities sent to the city to provide
transport.
   ``The situation is sharply deteriorating in Azerbaijan,'' Mrs.
Popoyan said in a report echoed later by Tass, the official Soviet
news agency.
   Tensions have been running high in the Caucasus since February,
when Armenians began agitating for the annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijani officials and Kremlin leaders have rejected the demand.
   Azerbaijanis say hundreds of thousands of people began taking to
the streets in Baku last week to protest what they say is an
Armenian effort to send settlers to Nagorno-Karabakh to strengthen
the Armenian majority there. The numbers could not be confirmed, and
obtaining reliable reports from the affected areas was difficult.
Telephone operators said phone lines to Azerbaijan were constantly
busy, and few calls were getting through.
   According to Azerbaijani officials and media, Armenian settlers
were taken last week to the Shusha area of Nagorno-Karabakh in
official trucks and began building an aluminum processing plant and
barracks with materials supplied by the Armenian government.
   ``The reason for these recent events is the illegal construction
in Nagorno-Karabakh,'' Savelli A. Perets, head of the official
Azerbaijani news agency Azerinform, said in a telephone interview.
   Mamedov, the republic's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said mobs in
Kirovabad and Nakhichevan attacked local government headquarters and
thetroops defending the buildings.
   Gerasimov said an army lieutenant and two privates were killed in
the Kirovabad violence.
   Mrs. Popoyan said reports from Kirovabad said the soldiers were
attacked while trying to defend Armenians, and that dozens of the
rioters were injured.
   A ``special situation'' was declared in Nakhichevan and
Kirovabad, and army troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers
sent into the streets of Baku and the two other cities to quell the
unrest, Azerbaijani officials said.
   ``The cities are now under control of the army,'' Mamedov said
earlier Thursday. ``The situation is still difficult.'' Later, he
reported violence had broken out again.
   He said from 50,000 to 100,000 protesters were on the streets of
Baku, and Perets said only 70 percent to 80 percent of the labor
force in the oil-producing industrial city on the Caspian Sea was at
work.
   A half-million Armenians live in Azerbaijan, whose total
population is 6.9 million, and Perets said the Armenian quarters of
Baku had been ringed by soldiers backed by armored personnel
carriers to protect the inhabitants.

<HEAD>Labor Decides to End Coalition Talks with Likud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Party's governing body voted
overwhelmingly Thursday to end coalition talks with the right-wing
Likud bloc and set strict guidelines for any future negotiations.
   The new rules, opposed by Shimon Peres, the party leader and
Israeli foreign minister, prohibit party leaders from negotiating
with Likud without the consent of the 125-member governing bureau.
   Talks between the center-left party and Likud on a possible joint
government deadlocked this week. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir leads
the conservative bloc.
   Shamir and Peres have been in a tenuous ``national unity''
coalition as equal partners since indecisive elections in July 1984.
Likud won 40 of the 120 parliament seats in Nov. 1 elections and
Labor got 39.
   Likud has negotiated with small religious and right-wing parties
for a majority coalition, but the small parties made numerous
demands and Likud offered Labor a junior partnership in a new
coalition.
   Israel radio said Likud was continuing negotiations with the
small parties and might form a coalition by next week.
   Of the Labor vote Thursday, party secretary-general Uzi Baram
said on the radio: ``The decision shows that there is no basis for
negotiations with the Likud.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a former Labor prime minister,
said on state television: ``In my view there is no significance to
what was decided. The talks with Likud were at their invitation to
form a joint government and the Likud knows that official
negotiations would need the party's permission.''
   Peres said talks could continue as long as official proposals
were brought before the party bureau. ``If in the future there is a
proposal, it will be brought before this body,'' he said as he left
the meeting.
   The radio said Shamir and Peres planned to meet by eary next week.
   A Foreign Ministry official said privately he could not confirm
whether a meeting would take place but added that contacts could
continue. ``The vote does not rule out contacts between party
members,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot and
wounded at least nine Palestinians in clashes in the occupied
territories Thursday, hospital officials said.
   The officials also said troops fatally shot a Palestinian woman,
but the army said she died in a family feud.
   At the Kalandia refugee camp north of Jerusalem, a mosque was
ransacked overnight, with windows smashed, holy books torn up and
religious tapes destroyed.
   Camp residents blamed Israeli security forces for the
desecration, but police said robbery involving local residents
appeared to be the motive.
   A Jewish settler was injured in the West Bank town of Qalqilya
when a brick was hurled at her car, Israel radio said.
   It said that in another attack in nearby Jenin, 15 Palestinians
threw stones at the car of a Jewish settler and tried to pull him
out and grab his gun, but he escaped.
   About 50 Jewish settlers demonstrated Thursday in front of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's residence in Jerusalem, demanding tough
measures to make roads safe in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Officials at Mukassad Hospital in Jerusalem said Marwan Kneiry, a
27-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Yaabad, died
Wednesday after he was hospitalized Nov. 7 with a concussion and
bruises.
   His family told doctors Kneiry was beaten by soldiers. Army
officials denied the military was involved and said Kneiry was
attacked ``by local villagers in a feud between two clans.''
   In the Gaza Strip, a 40-year-old woman, Nawal Abu Ittryah, was
fatally shot in the head, officials at Gaza's Shifa Hospital said.
   They quoted Arab residents who brought the woman as saying she
was shopping in the Shati refugee camp market when troops fired on
Arab youths who stoned a passing military jeep, and was apparently
struck by a stray bullet.
   The army denied any shooting incident in the area and said Ms.
Ittryah died in a family feud.
   ``She was brought (to Shifa) by a local car that immediately
escaped. The body was taken to the Abu Kabir Institute in Israel for
autopsy and it was determined she was shot from a weapon that is not
army-issued,'' said a military spokesman, who cannot be identified
under military rules.
   The nine Palestinians wounded Thursday included a 10-year-old boy
struck in the left leg in the open-air market in Nablus in the West
Bank, hospital officials said.
   One of the wounded, a 21-year-old man from a village near the
West Bank town of Ramallah, was in serious condition with a gunshot
wound to the stomach, doctors said.
   The military spokesman's office said it was checking the reports.
   At least 315 Palestinians have been killed, most by army gunfire,
since the Arab uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip began last December. Eleven Israelis also have died.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war. The territories are home to
1.5 million Palestinians.
   About 20,000 children in 36 Israeli schools practiced chemical
warfare defenses Thursday in Israel's largest exercise of the kind.
   Israel TV showed students rushing to bomb shelters to the sound
of sirens, extinquishing a schoolyard fire and evacuating the
wounded.
   It said the students were required to wear gas masks for a
half-hour, but that many removed the masks earlier.
   Israel is worried that its Arab foes may use chemical weapons to
attack the Jewish state's civilian rear in the event of war. Last
month, U.S. CIA director William Webster said that Iraq, Syria and
Libya possess chemical weapons.

<HEAD>Afghan Mutineers Defeated in Attempt to Seize Headquarters</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MOSCOW ( AP) _ An Afghan army detachment of 400 men mutinied and
tried to seize a provincial headquarters but was ambushed by troops
loyal to the government and defeated in a bloody battle, Tass
reported Thursday.
   The Soviet news agency, in a dispatch from Kabul, called the
Monday night incident a coup attempt in the city of Kandahar in
southern Afghanistan.
   According to the report, officers and soldiers loyal to the
pro-Soviet Afghan government learned of the plan and ambushed the
mutineers, forcing them into retreat.
   In another report from Kabul, capital of the war-torn country,
Tass said Afghan troops uncovered 70 corpses in plastic bags near
the border city of Torkham.
   ``Investigating bodies reached the conclusion that they were
tortured to death,'' it said, adding that the victims' hands and
legs were chained and traces of chemicals were found on the faces of
some of the dead.
   Fighting in the area reportedly forced suspension of the
investigation.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters at
a briefing in Moscow that a Pakistan-based rebel group used poison
pills to kill a Soviet prisoner and tested the pills on two Afghan
officers, who also died.
   ``Rebels from the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group intend to use the
tablets to kill unsuitable persons,'' Tass said.

<HEAD>British Students Clash With Police in Protest Over Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 students demanding the government keep
its loan program broke away from a larger protest Thursday and
scuffled with police near Parliament. About 23 people were hurt,
said hospital and police sources.
   The disturbances forced police temporarily to close four of the
busiest Thames River bridges at Lambeth, Westminster, Waterloo and
Southwark.
   Protesters said the police, some of whom were mounted, charged
the students. Police denied it. They reported arresting about 60
students.
   The students involved set out to march on Parliament from a
nearby protest of about 15,000 people, said a spokesman for the
National Union of Students. The protest organizer, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said they were chanting slogans at
Westminster Bridge, next to Parliament, when police moved in.
   ``More than 20 police horses and at least 100 policemen on foot
just charged a crowd of people indiscriminately. The horses went
among the crowd and pushed people up against walls,'' he said.
   Ali Kayley, a 21-year-old student, said a policeman hit her in
the stomach and a horse trampled her. ``There wasn't any violence
until the police started it,'' she said.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, also
reported that police had charged.
   However, Scotland Yard denied it. It said horses are used only to
control crowds and disperse people without causing injuries.
   Chief Inspector Tony Johnson said students ignored orders from
their own leaders to disperse and repeatedly shoved police lines.
   ``People are not allowed to march on Parliament,'' he said.
Demonstrations are illegal at Parliament when it is in session.
   Officials at St. Thomas Hospital said about 20 people, mostly
students, were treated for minor hurts. Police said three officers
were slightly injured.
   The protesters were demonstrating against government proposals to
make students take out bank loans for higher education instead of
receiving government grants.

   A man upset about his wife's request for a
separation killed her and his daughter and critically wounded his
son before turning the gun on himself, authorities said.
   Beverly Vansant, 33, had moved to Loveland with her two children
to ``basically to seek shelter from him as a result of domestic
violence,'' said police Sgt. John Teeples.
   William Vansant, 38, went to the home Wednesday night and Mrs.
Vansant refused to let him in, Teeples said. Vansant then demanded
that the children be brought to the front window so he could see
them, the officer said.
   ``The victim complied,'' Teeples said. ``Then he produced a
handgun and fired an undetermined number of shots through the window.
   ``He then went back to the car, retrieved a shotgun and made
entry through the window he had blown out and completed the homicide
of his daughter and the homicide of his wife,'' Teeples said.
   Vansant walked to his car in a parking lot nearby, pulled out a
second shotgun, placed it in his mouth and ``fired one fatal shot.''
   Mrs. Vansant and her daughter, Lindsey, 6, died at the scene,
Teeples said. Her son, Lee, 7, was in guarded, but stable, condition
at McKee Medical Center Thursday. He had been shot in the face,
shoulder and leg.
   Mrs. Vansant had filed for separation on Tuesday, Teeples said.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's Umma Party
approved a peace agreement that the governing coalition's junior
partner signed with southern rebels, two newspapers reported
Thursday.
   The Al-Ayam and Al-Siyassa newspapers quoted Ali Hassan
Taj-el-Din, Umma's secretary-general, as saying the Wednesday night
vote among party leaders was unanimous. It was the first time Umma
had reacted to the pact.
   Parliament still must approve the accord.
   The understanding was signed last week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
by John Garang, leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army,
and Mohamed Osman al-Mirghani, spiritual leader of the Democratic
Unionist Party.
   It calls for a cease-fire in the 5{-year-old civil war in which
rebels are fighting the Moslem-dominated national government for
economic and social changes in the mainly Christian and animist
south.
   Under the accord, controversial Islamic laws in Sudan would be
suspended and a constitutional conference would be convened next
month.
   According to Al-Siyassa, Taj-el-Din said Umma leaders had
reservations about details of the pact which they would communicate
to the Democratic Unionists. The newspaper report did not elaborate.
   Mahdi earlier expressed satisfaction with the accord and with
rebel statements denying responsibility for a missile attack on a
C-130 plane carrying Defense Minister Abdul-Maguid Khalil.
   The attack came one day after the pact was signed and was blamed
by the government on the rebels. It damaged the plane but caused no
casualties.
   The fundamentalist National Islamic Front, also a member of the
coalition Cabinet, has rejected the agreement, mainly because it
suspends Moslem law.

<HEAD>Patricia Hearst Makes Bid For Full Pardon; FBI Agent Opposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former FBI agent who headed the
nationwide hunt for Patty Hearst 14 years ago opposes the heiress'
request for a full presidential pardon of her bank robbery and
weapons possession convictions.
   Hearst, her family and friends have maintained that she was
brainwashed by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, a group of
self-styled revolutionaries who abducted her from a house in
Berkeley in February 1974.
   Months later, she announced she had joined her kidnappers and
took the name ``Tania.'' She was arrested 19 months later in San
Francisco following one of the largest manhunts in U.S. history.
   ``I don't believe she was brainwashed to the point where she was
not responsible in some way for her actions. I just don't buy it,''
said retired FBI Special Agent Charles Bates, who led the hunt for
Hearst and the SLA.
   Bates, who has informed the pardon office of his opposition,
added he believes ``everybody has a right to right their wrongs, but
in crimes of violence, you shouldn't get a pardon the first time you
asked for it.''
   Hearst, 34, whose seven-year federal prison sentence was commuted
by President Carter in 1979, is asking to be forgiven for the crime,
according to a petition filed with U.S. Pardon Attorney David
Stevenson in Washington. She served 23 months at the Women's
Correctional Facitlity in Pleasanton near San Francisco.
   The papers for the pardon were filed on Aug. 4, said a spokesman
for the office, Brad Marman. A pardon would not erase Hearst's
criminal record, Marman added.
   The heiress to a San Francisco newspaper family was convicted by
a U.S. District Court jury in 1976 for her role in the SLA's robbery
of a Hibernia Bank branch two years before. The evidence included a
photograph by a bank camera that captured her wielding an automatic
weapon.
   Hearst's prosecutor, former U.S. Attorney James Browning, today a
San Mateo County Superior Court Judge, said earlier this year he was
leaning against giving his approval to a possible request by Hearst
for a full pardon.
   Browning declined to comment on the case this week, saying it is
inappropriate because of his position as a judge.
   A spokesman for the pardon office said the application review
process could take several years and depends completely on the
discretion of the president.
   The thrust of Hearst's petition is that she has been a model
citizen, wife and mother since being released from prison on Feb. 1,
1979.
   Hearst lives in Westport, Conn., with her husband and former San
Francisco police bodyguard, Bernard Shaw, and their two young
daughters.
   Hearst's attorney, George Martinez of San Francisco, said
Wednesday there was no connection between her request for a full
pardon and the release of the movie ``Patty Hearst'' in late
September. The movie is based on Hearst's book, ``Every Secret
Thing,'' her version of the bizarre time she spent in the SLA.
   Martinez said ``she wants to put it all behind her ... And she
wants to get some indication that there is now complete
understanding by the government of the extraordinary circumstances
under which she participated'' in the bank robbery.
   A commutation of sentence is generally considered a partial
pardon of a crime.

   OPEC oil ministers struck a tentative
agreement Thursday to curtail their soaring production and lift
crude prices. If adopted, the pact would mean higher prices for
gasoline and other petroleum products.
   Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh of Iran said he would return to
Tehran on Friday to consult with his government before accepting the
plan. He said he might return to the OPEC meeting on Sunday.
   The arrangement, he said, would set total OPEC production at 18.5
million barrels a day for the first six months of 1989. It would
maintain the cartel's benchmark price of $18 a barrel.
   Recent production increases have driven oil prices well below
that mark.
   Cartel members often have ignored their quotas and analysts say
current production has well exceeded 20 million barrels a day.
   Each dollar increase in the price of crude oil theoretically
means a rise of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices.
   A minister involved in the discussions with Iran, asked if the
plan could be modified, replied, ``Not from our point of view.'' He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Venezuelan Oil Minister Julio Cesar Gil said, ``It's a fluid
situation. It depends. ... Mr. Aghazadeh (is going) to Tehran for
consultations.''
   The tentative plan, worked out by the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, was put forth to break a deadlock
between Iran and Iraq over a new output accord.
   Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, has been
insisting that Iraq's production ceiling in any new pact be the same
as Iran's. Aghazadeh had said no.
   It was unclear exactly how that dispute was resolved.
   Asked if was still refusing to allow Iraq to have the same quota
as Iran, Aghazadeh replied, ``This is exactly the issue which I have
to consult with my government.''
   Aghazadeh, who spoke to reporters after a late evening meeting
with other ministers, said Iran would retain its share of total
cartel output at 14.27 percent.
   ``I received a new proposal,'' he said, ``in which my main
concern, which is to preserve my percentage share, is taken into
consideration.''
   A ceiling of 18.5 million barrels would give Iran a quota of 2.64
million barrels a day. It currently has a ceiling of 2.4 million
barrels.
   Iraq's quota in the current accord is 1.5 million barrels a day.
Iran has been allowed more to serve its larger domestic oil market.
   Aghazadeh said the other 11 members have agreed to give part of
their share to Iraq in an effort to break the deadlock.
   The plan must be approved by all 13 OPEC ministers.
   Formal negotiations among the OPEC ministers had broken off
shortly after the winter meeting began here Monday.
   The ministers had been scheduled to return to the bargaining
table on Wednesday but postponed their formal meeting until
Thursday, then put it off until Friday.
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil chief, and
Oil Ministers Sadek Boussena of Algeria, Ginandjar Kartasasmita of
Indonesia and Gil of Venezuela met with Aghazadeh for about an hour
Thursday.
   Asked earlier Thursday whether officials had delivered an
ultimatum to Iran, Ginandjar replied, ``We don't work on that basis.
We never give an ultimatum to anybody. Everything should be done on
consensus.''
   The apparent inability of the ministers to break the Iran-Iraq
deadlock had raised the possibility that they might adjourn their
talks this week and try again in December or January.
   If the ministers fail to reach a production agreement this week,
analysts have said prices could weaken further.
   The January contract price for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, closed Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at $13.97 a barrel. The markets were closed Thursday in the
United States for the Thanksgiving holiday.
   The current ceiling for 12 members _ Iraq refused to join _ is
about 15 million barrels a day.
   The cartel has been exceeding that sum, with production estimated
at more than 21 million barrels a day.
   The ministers want to include Iraq in any new output accord.
   Some of the OPEC ministers arrived in Vienna more than a week ago
to try to stop the feuding between Iran and Iraq. The bitter rivals
agreed to a cease-fire in August in their 8-year-old war.

   Tornado victims and thousands of the disadvantaged got free
Thanksgiving meals Thursday, while millions of other Americans
watched parades and football games and sat down at family dinner
tables.
   Pennsylvania State Police attached red ribbons to door handles of
all marked patrol cars and New Hampshire State Police drove with
their lights on to remind motorists of the dangers of drinking and
driving. Many roads in the Northwest were wet with rain or slick
with new snow.
   California's Sierra Nevada range had up to 4 feet of snow from a
storm the day before. ``This has to be the best Thanksgiving skiing
we've ever had,'' said receptionist Beverly Garrett at Squaw Valley
USA. Around Los Angeles, 55- degree water didn't deter surfers.
   Millions of people watched on television and an estimated 2.2
million lined sidewalks as 11 huge helium balloons depicting cartoon

   Some 900,000 people turned out for the annual parade in Detroit
which featured Los Angeles Lakers star Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson, a
Michigan native, jazz musician Lionel Hampton and civil rights

   Thousands of Texans lined Houston streets for the 39th annual
Foley's Thanksgiving Day Parade, with floats depicting Christmas
songs.
   The nation's oldest Thanksgiving Day parade, established in 1919,

going to the parade ``for years.''
   President Reagan and his wife Nancy gathered with relatives and

   In Birmingham, Ala., more than 50 football-loving families had
Thanksgiving dinner together in campers outside Legion Field, a

   Cotham's Country Store in tiny Scott, Ark., isn't usually open
Thanksgiving, but this year the store and restaurant served turkey
dinner free to victims of a tornado that killed three people in the

   ``These people are trying to at least get roofs back on their

start over. They can come here and at least not worry about
Thanksgiving dinner,'' said owner Bill Cotham said. ``I guess if we
have any leftovers, we'll just give 'em away when the townsfolk get
their freezers working again.''
   Donations and volunteers enabled up to 18,000 homeless and other

Atlanta. The Rev. Hosea Williams said volunteers also would deliver
at least 3,000 meals to shut-ins.
   Some 25,000 senior citizens and homeless people in Philadelphia
got Thanksgiving dinner Wednesday thanks to Minnie Moore. She

now gets dinner funded by donations at the Civic Center.
   Bob Willmott, a longtime helper of the homeless in Seattle, set
up his organization's annual Thanksgiving Day meal in drizzly,
40-degree weather. Willmott estimated about 1,800 people would

   In Dayton, Ohio, 6,000 people packed a convention hall for the
20th annual Community Thanksgiving Dinner. They consumed 166
turkeys, 1,600 pounds of stuffing and 822 pies. It took 150
volunteers to help prepare the meal, sponsored by the Beerman
Foundation.
   In Texas, volunteers in Houston began cooking Wednesday and
expected to feed about 20,000 homeless and poor people in front of
City Hall.
   Dozens of agencies served dinner to homeless, hungry or lonely
people in Chicago and thousands of needy people in Michigan also got
a hot dinner. ``For 95 percent of the people, this is the only meal
they'll have today,'' said one participant at the Capuchin Community
Center in Detroit who declined identification.
   All 11,000 residents of the Southern Illinois hamlet of Herrin
were invited to dinner but only 600 showed up, mostly single and
elderly. ``Everybody's trying to help the needy but nobody tries to
help the people who are alone, and that was our biggest intention on
this thing,'' said Mayor Ed Quaglia.
   On a smaller scale, the owner of a hot dog stand in Pittsburgh
offered free turkey dogs, coffee and candy to the needy.
   In Miami, frozen Thanksgiving dinners for 2,500 elderly people
were recalled after the Little Havana Activities and Nutrition
Center distributing the meals discovered the mashed potatoes had
spoiled during freezing.
   Representatives of the catering company and the center planned to
go to the homes of the recipients to retrieve and replace all of the
spoiled meals by Thursday, said Josefina Carbonell, president of the
center.
   Several Indian nations sent tribal leaders to the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine in New York for an evening ceremony of
reconciliation between descendants of the Indians and those of the
Pilgrims.
   ``We, the boat people, will be thanking the natives for giving us
Thanksgiving, giving us their tradition,'' said the Rev. James Parks
Morton, the cathedral's dean, ``and asking forgiveness for the ways
in which they have been mistreated by the newcomers with respect to
their lands, and with respect to respect.''
   Other Indians gathered for a mourning ceremony in Plymouth,
Mass., near the statute of Massasoit, the Wampanoag chief who made a
peace treaty with the Plymouth Colony in 1621. Wampanoags are
believed to have attended the first Thanksgiving dinner.
   ``We helped them out, and we're still under oppression,'' said
Ellworth Oakley, present supreme sachem of the Wampanoag nation.

   Hungary ordered a Romanian envoy out of
the country Thursday in retaliation for Romania's expulsion of a
ranking Hungarian diplomat, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Relations between the neighboring Soviet bloc allies have been
strained by Hungary's allegations about discrimination against 1.7
million ethnic Hungarians living in Romania.
   A formal protest of the expulsion Saturday of Karoly Gyorfi, a
Hungarian commercial counselor, was given to the Romanian Embassy in
Budapest, the official Hungarian news agency MTI reported.
   The note said that ``as a response,'' Pavel Platona, a Romanian
political counselor erroneously described by MTI as Gyorfi's
counterpart, was declared persona non grata and given 72 hours to
leave the country.
   Andras Gulyas, head of the Foreign Ministry press department,
spoke of a warranted Hungarian reaction to a ``serious provocative
act'' by Romania, which he said was unparalleled in relations
between Warsaw Pact nations.
   Last Friday, the Foreign Ministry released a statement saying
Gyorfi was detained for six hours by Romanian police and accused of
distributing inciting leaflets.
   Hungary ignored a Romanian request to recall Gyorfi and said the
Romanian accusations were ``completely unfounded.''
   Last summer, Romania closed the Hungarian consulate at
Cluj-Napoca in Transylvania and expelled its staff after a
demonstration in Budapest by up to 50,000 people protesting Romanian
policies.

   A 13-year-old boy was killed and three
people were wounded in gunfire at two demonstrations during a
communist-led general strike Thursday to protest the government's
new austerity measures. officials said.
   They reported 35 arrests in clashes.
   A drivers' walkout dramatically reduced bus transportation in the
capital, Quito. Many thousands of workers had to walk to their jobs,
but most businesses appeared to be open.
   In the port city of Guayaquil, about 180 miles south, dozens of
strikers and non-strikers battled at a plastics plant, said Guayas
Province Gov. Rafael Guerrero. He said three non-strikers were
injured by buckshot in the fighting and that police arrested 32
strikers and seized six shotguns.
   News reports said the daylong strike had little effect elsewhere
in this small nation of 10 million in the Andes Mountains.
   It was the first nationwide strike against the center-left
government of President Rodrigo Borja, who took office Aug. 10. He
faced 55 percent annual inflation, a foreign debt of $9.2 billion,
and depressed oil prices.
   Ecuador depends on oil sales for 60 percent of its foreign
exchange earnings.
   His government imposed austerity measures this week trying to cut
inflation and solve other economic problems. Measures included a 35
percent devaluation, a doubling of the price of gasoline, and
foreign-exchange controls.
   The United Front of Laborers, Ecuardor's most powerful labor
organization, called the work stoppage in protest.
   Government spokesman Luis Felix said the boy was killed during a
street demonstration in Quito but that authorities did not know who
fired the shot.
   Police chased off small numbers of protesters downtown.
   At one point, they fired tear gas to disperse about 50 people
painting strike slogans on the walls of the government palace,
police said. The building serves as Borja's home and office.

   Two out-of-state investor groups have made formal
bids to buy The Miami News, slated to close Dec. 31 unless a buyer
is found, it was reported Thursday.
   The amount of money offered in both bids for the 92-year-old
paper was not disclosed but was ``nominal'' and were in the same
ballpark on sale terms, said David Easterly, president of the Cox
Enterprises newspaper division.
   Negotiations are under way to resolve differences, and Cox
officials are hopeful a tentative agreement can be reached with one
of the bidders by next week, Easterly told The News in a story
published Thursday.
   ``It's a matter of dealing with some complexities that would not
seem extraordinarily difficult to resolve,'' he said. ``Both offers
will have to be explored.'' He said no more bids are expected.
   The identities of the bidders were not revealed, but Easterly
characterized them as investor groups of businessmen from outside
Florida. He said the groups are not in the newspaper business, but
one may include ``some people with past newspaper experience.''
   Cox announced Oct. 14 that The News would be close Dec. 31 if no
buyer was found, citing declining circulation and continuing
financial losses at the three-edition, afternoon daily which has won
five Pulitzer Prizes.

<HEAD>Study Says Gun Injuries Cost Taxpayers Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firearms-related injuries cost American taxpayers
an estimated $429 million a year in hospital expenses, researchers
say.
   The estimate does not include the costs of such services as
physicians' fees and ambulance charges, which, if included, could
bring the national price tag to more than $1 billion a year, the
researchers said.
   The scientists based their conclusions on a study of 134 people
with gun injuries who were admitted in 1984 to San Francisco General
Hospital, where all city ambulances are required to take gunshot
victims.
   The government paid 85.7 percent of hospital costs, not including
professional services, while the patients paid only 1.4 percent of
costs, the researchers reported in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Private insurers paid for the remainder, they said.
   In 1984, public sources paid 53 percent of the costs for all
hospitalizations in the United States, researchers said.
   ``It is clear from these data that public sources bear the
greatest burden of the cost of hospitalization for firearm
injuries,'' said co-author Michael Martin and his associates in
epidemiology at the University of California in San Francisco.
   Patients, most of whom were injured during hangun assaults,
stayed in the hospital an average of 6.2 days. All but 10 survived.
Hospital costs ranged from $559 to $64,470, with an average of
$6,915.
   The authors acknowledged their national cost estimates were ``a
rough approximation,'' but said they believed they had made
reasonable assumptions in their estimates.

   Westinghouse, the new operator of the Savannah
River nuclear weapons plant will have projected expenses of $6.7
billion under a 5{-year Department of Energy contract signed this
week, but could earn as much as $17 million per year, DOE officials
say.
   Westinghouse Savannah River Co. will operate the plant for the
DOE beginning April 1, replacing the Du Pont Co., which has managed
SRP since it was built in the early 1950s.
   The plant's nuclear reactors have been shut down because of
safety concerns. One reactor tentatively is scheduled to be
restarted Dec. 31 but DOE officials have said they may push that
date back.
   SRP is the nation's sole producer of plutonium and tritium, which
are used in the warheads of nuclear weapons.
   The contract, signed Monday by Paul W. Kaspar, manager of the
DOE's Savannah River Operations and James S. Moore, president of
Westinghouse River Co., covers a projected $6.7 billion over the
5{-year period.
   The contract allows Westinghouse to be reimbursed for all
allowable expenses and guarantees a ``base fee'' of $1.25 million
during the first six months.
   Westinghouse also can earn up to $7.5 million in an ``award
fee,'' based on its performance during the first six months. Award
fees will be handed out every six months; the exact amount will be
negotiated.
   ``Based on excellent performance, WSRC could earn $13 (million)
to $17 million per year'' in award fees, the DOE said.
   The DOE's Savannah River Operations meanwhile has requested $11
million to build an engineering services office complex at SRP. The
proposal, which be approved by Congress and DOE officials in
Washington.
   James M. Gaver, a spokesman for the DOE's Savannah River
Operations, said the DOE office complex would be occupied primarily
by Bechtel Savannah River Co., Westinghouse's lead engineering
subcontractor. Gaver said the office complex could save the agency
as much as $2 million a year in business costs.

   The original spirit of Thanksgiving, when the
Indians and Pilgrims shed their differences and shared peace, was
revived Thursday night in a New York City cathedral as descendants
of both joined hands.
   About 4,000 people attended the service at the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine. It symbolized a spiritual reconciliation between
descendants of the Indians and generations of settlers who followed
the Pilgrims.
   ``We are trying to awaken in the American people a sense of
responsibility as parents of the next generation, a sense of
stewardship in the earth itself,'' said Chief Oren Lyons of the
Onondaga Tribe in upstate New York.
   Typically, Indians view Thanksgiving Day much differently than
the people who took over their land.
   ``In some parts of the country, they call Thanskgiving a day of
mourning _ to look about and see what's happened to the earth and
see how things have changed and what terrible circumstances we are
in today,'' he said.
   Upon entering the cathedral, people were handed sprigs of sage, a
sacred plant, from among 6,000 sprigs sent from Navajos in
northeastern Arizona. Once inside, they were treated to the sounds
of water drums, the instruments of the Ankle Deep singers from the
Onondagas Tribe.
   Representatives of 12 tribes were present, their deerskins and
native dress contrasting sharply with the tuxedos and suits of the
Pilgrim's descendants.
   Organizers said they hoped that it and several other unrelated
services held across the nation Thursday would help focus attention
again on the true meaning of Thanksgiving, a notion that has been
blurred by the years since the Indians left the harvest table in
Plymouth, Mass., in 1621.
   Jim Buden, a trustee of the cathedral, said he hoped the service
would help to resurrect the original intent of Thanksgiving, to
allow Indians and the new settlers to celebrate the harvest together.
   ``That has been lost,'' he said. ``The native Americans are no
longer part of the American Thanksgiving when, in fact, they were
the original co-celebrants.''

   A top aide to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi
conferred with Premier Ciriaco De Mita Thursday night at the
beginning of a visit to Italy seen as part of a Libyan campaign to
shed its image of supporting terrorism.
   Staff Maj. Abdulsalam Jalloud is the highest-ranking Libyan to
visit Rome officially since the firing of a Libyan missile at an
Italian island hours after the U.S. bombing of Tripoli in April 1986.
   Jalloud's last official visit to Italy was in December 1984.
   His meeting with De Mita lasted 1{ hours. The Libyan official is
also expected to see Pope John Paul II, whom he has met before.
   Italian news agencies, citing unidentified official sources, said
the Italian government considered Thursday night's meeting
significant because it demonstrated the ``renewal of the dialogue
between the two countries'' after previous misunderstandings.
   Jalloud, a friend of Col. Gadhafi since high school, has played
leading roles in Libyan politics since the 1969 coup that brought
Gadhafi to power and often has been sent abroad as the country's top
emissary.
   Both Libyan and Italian sources recently have indicated that
Gadhafi is eager to have better relations with the West and sees his
country's former colonizer as a vehicle to respectability and to
prospects of expanded economic ties with Western Europe.
   Italy depends greatly on Libyan oil and is the Arab state's
largest trading partner. Italian companies do billions of dollars in
construction, engineering, commerce and other business in Libya.
   Italian officials indicated Italy welcomes the visit as an
opportunity to increase commercial ties.
   But there was some concern in political circles over Jalloud's
visit.
   It ``represents an important moment in the attempt that Tripoli
is making to achieve a better image for a country long accused of
having too many ties with terrorist groups,'' said Filipppo Caria,
head of the Social Democrats in the lower house of Parliament.
   ``As far as we're concerned, it's an important occasion to check
out the real proposals of Gadhafi.'' He noted that only last month
Gadhafi denounced Italy for its colonial rule and deportation of
Libyans during the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.
   Caria said he was concerned that ``in the attempt to recover a
dialogue with Tripoli, commercial interests don't prevail over
political ones.''
   The United States bombed the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and the
coastal city of Benghazi on April 15, 1986 after accusing Libya of
involvement in the terrorist attack on a Berlin disco. Among the
sites hit was Gadhafi's house in a military compound in Tripoli.
   A few hours later, a Libyan missile was fired at the tiny
Sicilian island of Lampedusa, home to a U.S. Coast Guard facility.
But the rocket landed harmlessly in the Mediterranean.
   Then-Premier Bettino Craxi warned Libya against future attack,
saying Italy would hit back. Since then the two countries have been
working to improve relations.

   The federal government plans to require
automakers to install rear-seat shoulder belts in all new cars
beginning with the 1990 model year.
   The announcement Wednesday by the Transportation Department came
just hours after a private research group, the Institute for Injury
Reduction, publicly criticized the department for not requiring
shoulder restraints in rear seats.
   Critics for several years have questioned the degree of safety
provided by belts that fit only across the lap. Most cars have this
kind of belt in the rear seat. Benjamin Kelley, president of the
Institute, said motorists are faced with ``a pick your poison
choice'' because in some types of accidents the lap belts provide
added protection, while in others they contribute to the severity of

   A plant toxin combined with a special protein
is able to attack and kill cells infected with the AIDS virus while
leaving healthy cells untouched, a group of Texas researchers report.
   However, they cautioned that the new laboratory development _
like other incremental advances in AIDS research _ was far from
being ready for clinical application and, at best, might offer a
potential new treatment approach rather than a cure.
   Dr. Jonathan W. Uhr, chairman of the department of microbiology
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas,
said a study to be published Friday shows a synthetic molecule
called recombinant CD4 can used in a test-tube to deliver a killer
toxin to cells infected with AIDS.
   Uhr said the CD4 molecule naturally binds to a gycoprotein,
called gp120, that forms on the surface of cells infected with human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDs.

   The government proposed laws Thursday to stiffen
prison sentences for terrorism, make it harder for the IRA to
finance operations and require candidates in Northern Ireland
elections to disavow violence.
   The measures were presented to Parliament the day after a man and
his granddaughter were killed in a bungled Irish Republican Army
bombing. They are virtually certain to pass in the 650-member House
of Commons, where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has a huge
101-seat majority.
   Her government suggested the anti-violence oath last year as a
means of undermining the IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, in

   At the heart of Sinn Fein ideology is support for what it calls
the IRA ``armed struggle'' and the government calls terrorism.

   Overseas sales by U.S. arms manufacturers
shrank significantly in fiscal 1987 despite a strong demand for
weapons by Middle East countries, a new study concludes.
   The McDonnell Douglas Corp. was one of the few major defense
contractors to buck the industry slump and managed to assume the
position of No. 1 arms exporter with sales totaling $657 million,
the study adds.
   ``The value of contracts awarded to U.S. defense contractors for
military equipment and services earmarked for export abroad fell in
fiscal year 1987 for the second year in a row, to $4.9 billion _ off
22 percent from the 1986 level and a whopping 44 percent below
1985,'' concludes the report.
   ``The overall decline in Foreign Military Sale awards led to a
drop in the level of arms export business for 17 of the top 25 U.S.
arms exporting companies in 1987.''

   Iran and Iraq began a 10-day exchange of
sick and wounded prisoners of war Thursday, but a jet chartered by
the International Red Cross shuttled fewer men than than promised
between the enemy capitals.
   The plane flew 52 Iraqi prisoners to Baghdad and 19 Iranians to
Tehran.
   Iraq accused Iran of reneging on an agreement to exchange 115
Iraqis for 41 Iranians on the first day of the operation, in which
1,570 men are to be repatriated. In retaliation, Iraq reduced the
number of Iranians sent home.
   A dispatch from Iran's official news agency, monitored in Cyprus,
said fewer Iraqis were returned because 15 of the 115 asked for
political asylum, 21 already had been granted asylum and 27 no
longer were eligible for repatriation because Red Cross doctors
found them recovered from their illnesses.

   Deadlocked lawmakers Thursday averted the
threat of Thanksgiving dinner at the Statehouse by adopting an
unprecedented ``speaker du jour'' plan under which a Democrat and a
Republican will preside on alternating days.
   The 100-member Indiana House, evenly divided between Republicans
and Democrats for the first time in history, also will give some
powers previously held by the House speaker to the chamber's
membership, breaking the speaker's 132-year domination of the
chamber.
   The agreement, sealed by party leaders' handshake at 2:10 a.m.,
broke a two-day stalemate. The announcement was greeted by two
standing ovations by lawmakers who had feared the conflict would
ruin their holiday.
   In addition to alternating speakers, both parties will have a
co-chairman and equal membership on each committee, and there will
be one clerk from each party to run the day-to-day administration of
the chamber.

   There may be a little less peace on earth for
smokers in Britain this Christmas.
   The National Society of Non-Smokers has rewritten five Christmas
carols to give them a seasonal anti-smoking flavor, and it hopes the
rest of the nation will sing along.
   Thus ``O Little Town of Bethlehem'' has become ``O Little Lungs
of Smoking Men,'' and ``We Three Kings'' has been transformed from a
story of the Magi to a tale of three representatives of the tobacco
industry.
   To the tune of ``God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,'' the society has
written the ominous-sounding lyrics, and ``Away in the Manger'' was
changed to ``Oblivious of Danger.''

   Purdy High School students are eagerly planning
the first school dance ever in this century-old town while the
strains of legal maneuvers play in the background.
   But dates from other schools won't be allowed in the door, and a
radio station that poked fun at the school board isn't welcome
either _ not even if it provides free music.
   The ban on school dances in this small town in the Ozarks was
struck down by a judge last summer, and student president Nancy Fox
said classmates are talking in the halls and whispering at their
desks about the homecoming dance planned Dec. 10.
   ``I'm looking forward to it. I'm excited,'' said Miss Fox, who is
in charge of choosing a dance theme, music and colors for the paper
streamers.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the OPEC oil ministers come to town,
a small part of Vienna is nearly turned into a Middle Eastern souk
where the trading is in information rather than Oriental rugs or
brass plates.
   A vast array of people appear when the ministers of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gather for their
meetings.
   The lobby of one of Vienna's luxury hotels is packed with
reporters, oil industry analysts and traders, company officials,
U.S. state legislators and assorted others.
   It has all the hustle, bustle, pushing, shoving, shouting and
dealing that characterizes any market.
   Any remark made by a minister is seized upon. Rumors abound and
are spread quickly in small groups, behind hotel pillars or on the
lobby telephones.
   Reporters trip over oil traders in the pursuit of the latest
scrap of news.
   The right word can send the financial markets soaring. Millions
of dollars can be made or lost.
   Unlike summits of other influential government officials, OPEC
meetings are open-ended. Briefings are scarce and press releases
non-existent.
   The focus of attention is on the comings-and-goings of the
ministers. They stay in three nearby hotels overlooking the city's
Stadtpark, a large garden with a statue of composer Johann Strauss.
   Most ministers are in one hotel. Bitter rivals Iran and Iraq are
in separate hotels.
   The ministers carry out most of their business by shuttling among
the hotels. Their formal talks are held at OPEC headquarters about a
mile away.
   At this meeting, they are trying to reach agreement on a new
production accord that would limit their output and lift sagging oil
prices.
   As the ministers, surrounded by bodyguards and aides, hurry out
of and into hotel elevators, they are bombarded with questions.
   Some are more willing to talk than others and hold mini-news
conferences that generally last until the next elevator arrives.
   Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, a former newspaper
editor, is more tolerant.
   He and Iraqi oil chief, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, are
feuding over how much oil each will be allowed to produce in any new
agreement.
   Their remarks are highly prized.
   Aghazadeh on Tuesday sounded an optimistic note on the outcome of
the meeting.
   His brief statement _ ``I think we can reach an agreement '' _
sent oil prices soaring.
   Aghazadeh, who gives the impression of a humble man, later
remarked ruefully, ``I get the feeling that probably some traders
benefited a lot'' by the reported remarks.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Aghazadeh seems to prefer to have an aide translate his remarks
into English when a large group gathers.
   He sometimes speaks in English to add to the translation,
occasionally leading to confusion over his meaning.
   One day, he was asked if he were seeking both a higher OPEC quota
and a higher percentage of the total output.
   He said he couldn't change his percentage share. But listening to
the words on a tape recorder, the translator could barely be heard
saying, ``Probably I'm asking for both.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Aghazadeh's rival, al-Chalabi, is less willing to talk.
   In fact, he slips in and out of side doors to avoid reporters. So
the movements of his security personnel, some of whom wait in the
lobby, are closely watched.
   One man is easy to spot _ he has a shock of white in the front of
his dark hair.
   When he hasn't been seen for some time, it's likely his boss is
gone.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's minister, Hisham Nazer, is the object of intense
scrutiny.
   Observers like to say that each OPEC country has a single vote,
but Saudi Arabia has the barrels, a reference to its enormous oil
capacity and influence in the organization.
   Nazer says little and sometimes seems exasperated by the
attention.
   One day he returned to the hotel after a lunch with other
ministers, briefly went upstairs and then returned to the lobby.
   Noticing a few reporters starting to move toward him, he remarked
he hadn't been gone long enough to do anything.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Subroto, the cheery former Indonesian oil minister who is now
secretary-general of OPEC, seems to enjoy the activity.
   One day an elevator door opened and out stepped Subroto. No
reporters gathered.
   He stopped, did a small tap dance and waved his arms. The hordes
quickly surrounded him.

   Libya's oil chief, Fawzi Shakshuki, met with Mana Saeed Otaiba of

information asked, ``What ARE your problems.''

   Ecuador's energy minister, Diego Tamariz, is new and many don't
yet immediately recognize him.
   But a member of his security detail stands out. He wears a

earring in one ear and his coat continently draped over his
shoulders _ movie star-style.

   Prince Abdul Aziz bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, a man with a keen
public relations sense, invited a group of reporters for coffee in
the wee hours of the morning.
   The young prince, a member of the royal family, acted the
gracious host making sure his guests were enjoying themselves.
   Analysts, who have watched the prince at recent OPEC meetings,
say he is obviously being groomed to be a mover and shaker in the
oil world.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   One of the few predictable things at the meeting is the departure
and arrival of Qatar's minister, Abdul Aziz bin Khalifa al Thani,
from the formal cartel talks.
   The minister has an uncanny knack for arriving after everyone and
leaving before anyone else.
   Long-time OPEC watchers have given him the nickname of LIFO _
last in, first out.

<HEAD>As Busy Holday Season Approaches, Retailers Vie For Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Credit-card customers of Stern's department
store in Jersey City, N.J., received a little something extra with
their November bills: an invitation to work.
   Officials of Mervyn's, a Hayward, Calif.-based retail chain, this
fall made the rounds of Rotary Clubs with the same invitation.
   With the approach of the Christmas selling season that begins
Friday, stores nationwide have sought to finesse their way around a
growing demand for retail sales help.
   ``It seems sometimes there are more help-wanted signs than job
seekers,'' said Samuel Ehrenhalt, Middle Atlantic regional head for
the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   That's not good news for stores contemplating the Christmas
season, which accounts for about quarter of their yearly sales.
   Some stores are offering bounties to employees who recommend
seasonal help who stay past Christmas. Those who do stay can get
bonuses. Other stores are recruiting retirees or college and high
school students with presentations at the beginning of the school
year, said Jack Fraser, human resources vice president at the
National Retail Merchant Assocation.
   Some are putting ``stuffers'' in shopping bags or taking out
display newspaper advertisements that tout store discounts, a major
drawing card.
   Mervyn's, which has 213 stores in the West and South, has placed
posters and brochures in stores seeking ``people who are proud of
their accomplishments in life,'' such as raising children, managing
a household or volunteer work.
   ``We have been able to maintain our workforce, but it's a
continuous challenge,'' said Mervyn's spokeswoman Kathy Blackburn.
   Several factors have made it more difficult for retailers to fill
their sales clerk ranks.
   The pool of employees, particularly younger people who make up a
higher proportion of retail workers, is declining. Unemployment
hovered around 5.5 percent for most of 1988, down from an average
6.2 percent in 1987 and 7 percent the year before, according Labor
Department statistics. Employment of 16- to 19-year-olds dipped to
7.9 million last month from 8.8 million in October 1987.
   At the same time, demand is increasing, as demonstrated by other
Labor figures: general merchandisers employed 2.5 million people in
August 1988, up 100,000 from August 1987.
   ``The pool is increasingly more limited, and it's created a very
competitive environment for all retailers,'' said Ms. Blackburn.
   Still, wages _ historically low because of competition _ have not
risen with the demand, Ehrenhalt said. ``Companies are very much
under constraints to keep costs in line,'' he said.
   Most stores at the Newport Centre Mall, a new shopping complex in
the densly urban setting of Jersey City, N.J., are having problems
finding clerks who stick with the job, said mall spokeswoman Barbara
Wills. The ``small, less trendy'' stores have the worst time, she
said.
   Upscale retailers such as The Limited, a women's clothing store,
present themselves as ``the place to be,'' said Ms. Willis.
   Donna Connolly, co-manger of the Lane Bryant store in the Garden
State Plaza Shopping Center in Paramus, N.J., said she has had no
problem hiring people, probably because the mall is easily
accessible by bus.
   Transportation difficulties have made it difficult to find help
at some Sears outlets, said spokesman Gordon Jones of Chicago-based
Sears, Roebuck & Co.
   ``It's a very spotty problem,'' he said, worse in the Chicago
suburban market and Northeast.
   ``Quite often, it's where you've got a fast-growing area where
the labor supply has not caught up with the shopping areas,'' he
said, or where higher-income residents would rather shop than work
during the holidays.

<HEAD>Pernod Clears Final Hurdle In Battle For Irish Distillers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pernod Ricard SA cleared the final hurdle
Thursday in its takeover battle for Irish Distillers Group PLC when
the Irish government approved the French company's $442 million bid
for the country's biggest whiskey maker.
   Rival bidder Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain said it would
allow its higher offer of $499 million lapse because of the decision.
   The ruling was announced early Thursday by Albert Reynolds just
before he stepped down as industry and commerce minister in a
Cabinet reshuffle.
   Dublin-based Irish Distillers said it ``welcomes the minister's
decision and looks forward to a speedy resolution to the bid.''
   The Pernod offer, which came to about $6.98 a share, vs. Grand
Met's $8.14 a share, has been given the green light by the European
Community Commission and courts in Dublin.
   On Wednesday, the High Court in London refused a request by Grand
Met for a judicial review of a British takeover panel ruling in
favor of Pernod.
   In approving the takeover, Reynolds stipulated that Irish
Distillers' new owners cannot dispose of any of the target's brands,
which include Jameson's and Paddy whiskeys, without ministerial
approval and that nothing should be done to distort the Irish
spirits market.
   Pernod controls 53.6 percent of Irish Distillers' shares. Grand
Met claims control of 30.06 percent, but Reynolds also ruled that
the British food and drinks giant must reduce its holding to no more
than 30 percent of Irish Distillers.
   Grand Met spokesman Tim Halford said the company was ``content''
to hold onto its minority stake in Irish Distillers because ``we
believe that Irish whiskey has a lot of potential as a world product
if marketed properly.''
   ``We have close links with Pernod around the world and a good
working relationship with them,'' Halford said, adding that ``we'll
have to see what develops over the next few weeks and months.''

   Iraq will establish a formal stock exchange
to deal with a growing volume of transactions in shares of newly
established private or government-owned companies, the minister of
finance announced Thursday.
   Minister Hikmat Omer Al-Hadithi told the daily newspaper
Al-Thawra that the initial, small-scale financial market will be
temporarily housed at the Industrial Bank before private sector
dealers will be allowed to buy and sell stocks and bonds.
   The minister did not specify when trading will begin.
   He said an increasing number of stocks are being traded in Iraq
due to the emergence of many new companies.
   The government recently offered more than 70 industrial,
agricultural and service projects for sale to the private sector,
but many have not been sold for lack of private capital.
   Since the August cease-fire in the 8-year Iran-Iraq war,
President Saddam Hussein has been trying to liberalize the country's
economic laws to encourage more private investment in reconstruction
projects.

   Stock prices drifted lower Thursday in the absence
of any concerted buying.
   Dealers said trading was light since Wall Street was shut down
for the Thanksgiving holiday.
   ``I'm afraid that when the U.S. market is closed, we lose a lot
of our incentive,'' one trader said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed off 4.1
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,833.0, up from the day's lowest level
of 1,827.8 but below its peak of 1,837.7.
   Volume was a modest 521.5 million shares, compared with 586.6
million shares Wednesday.

   The U.S. dollar edged lower against all major
currencies in European trading Thursday despite reports of
central-bank intervention. Gold rose.
   Currency dealers said trading was quiet because of the
Thanksgiving Day holiday in the United States, but that sentiment
toward the dollar remained bearish.
   Dollar purchases by central banks in Japan and West Germany
failed to prop up the U.S. currency, dealers said.
   The dollar closed at 121.15 yen in Tokyo, down from 121.78 on
Tuesday. Later, in London, it traded lower at 120.85 yen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8375, more expensive for
buyers than Wednesday's late $1.8355.
   Other late dollar rates Thursday compared with late Wednesday:
1.7135 West German marks, down from 1.7155; 1.4375 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4415; 5.8585 French francs, down from 5.8685; 1.9340
Dutch guilders, down from 1.9365; 1,273.75 Italian lire, down from
1,276.50; and 1.1960 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1982.
   Gold bullion prices were modestly higher, helped by the weakening
dollar, which makes gold a more attractive investment.
   Gold closed in London and Zurich at a bid $420 a troy ounce, up
from $419.25 in London and $419.30 in Zurich on Wednesday.
   Hong Kong gold closed at $421.16 an ounce, up from $427.87
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.14 a troy ounce,
up from $6.12.

<HEAD>Money-Short Banks Issuing IOUs To Farmers</HEAD>

   Chinese banks, caught short of cash because of
excessive lending and falling deposits, have had to issue IOUs to
farmers selling grain contracted by the state, officials said
Thursday.
   Agriculture Ministry official Sun Xiaoping said the cash
shortfall has occurred in several areas of the country and is
creating problems for farmers needing money to buy materials.
   He said the livelihoods of some farmers could be affected if they
are not paid soon for their grain crops.
   But Chen Qizhen, an official from the Commerce Ministry, said the
use of IOUs was not widespread and that farmers receiving the
promissory notes were being paid within days.
   The official China Daily reported earlier this month that branch
managers of the Agriculture Bank of China had met in Beijing to
discuss how to come up with about $5.1 billion needed to pay farmers
over the next two months.
   The report said the bank would have to attract large amounts of
deposits during the rest of the year to support its farm product
purchases.
   The cash shortage, it said, was caused by unchecked lending in
the first half of the year, spiralling inflation and a $2.1 billion
decline in the increase of new deposits over the first 10 months of
the year.

<HEAD>Japan Willing To Discuss Rice Issue At GATT Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan is prepared to discuss rice and other
agricultural issues in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks,
officials said Thursday as reports surfaced that U.S. President
Reagan has urged Japan to disband its rice market barriers.
   ``We take a positive view toward negotiations ... and we, too,
will not avoid discussion on the issue of market access for basic
foodstuffs,'' said a senior ministry official, briefing reporters on
condition of anonymity.
   He added, however, that officials preparing for the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ministerial meeting Dec. 5-8 in
Montreal, Canada, have not yet mapped out how Japan will respond to
possible GATT demands for foreign access to the country's protected
rice market.
   Japanese officials insist nations should be entitled to maintain
import restrictions on ``basic foodstuffs.'' They note Japan must
protect rice, its stable food, in order to maintain self-sufficiency
in the grain for security reasons.
   In a related development Thursday, Foreign Ministry officials
said President Reagan called on Japan to open up its rice market in
a personal letter to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in early
November.
   They said Reagan urged Japan to offer to open its rice market at
the upcoming GATT trade negotiations, which will be known as the
Uruguay Round because the selection of Montreal as the site was made
at the last GATT talks two years ago in Montevideo.
   The officials added that Reagan's letter was dispatched after
U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter rejected a petition by the
U.S. Rice Millers' Association to investigate Japan's rice market
barriers. Yeutter said, however, he was prepared to reconsider his
decision if Japan does not demonstrate willingness at the Montreal
meeting to open its markets.
   Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato, responding to Yeutter's
warning in late October, said while Japan was prepared to disuss
rice at the GATT meeting, ``it would be difficult for us to
respond'' if the United States singles out Japan.
   In his first letter to Takeshita on the issue, Reagan said
Yeutter's decision to reject the rice millers' petition does not
mean Washington supports Japan's rice policy and warned that Japan's
stance to date had been overly cautious.
   Yasuo Goto, deputy Agriculture Minister, told reporters Thursday
that Takeshita, in a reponse to Reagan, said Japan could only
discuss rice along with other agricultural issues at the Uruguay
Round, according to news reports.

   Broadcast ministers moved closer
Thursday to an agreement regulating Western Europe's television
programs.
   Ministers from the Council of Europe countries agreed on a
proposal for the first continental program guidelines, which would
ban pornography, racism and cigarette ads and limit advertising to
15 percent of daily transmission time.
   But a specific quota on how much programming must be
European-produced _ a system suggested by France to stem the flood
of American reruns _ was left out of the draft sent to the 22-nation
council for approval, said meeting chairman Bengt Goransson.
   At a two-day conference, the ministers agreed that a ``high
percentage'' of programming should be produced by Europeans, said
Goransson, the Swedish broadcast minster. Britain, West Germany,
Holland and others opposed the quota idea.
   ``We face today a situation in the television market where the
European market is open for second-hand U.S. production,'' said
Goransson. He told reporters that a set percentage could be a next
step.
   The spread of cable and satellite broadcasting has brought
western stars Cisco and Pancho, the Monkees, Mr. Ed and other
well-worn U.S. series into homes all over Western Europe.
   ``It isn't necessary that films always come from the States to
Europe,'' said Goransson. ``But (they should) also come from Europe
to the States.''
   A meeting report estimated that less than 10 percent of the shows
produced in Europe ever leave the continent.
   The draft convention also limits program interruptions for
advertising, says that ads cannot be directed at a single country
and allows for suspension of programs that do not comply with some
of the rules.
   Goransson said the proposal could be adopted by the council early
next year, although the leadership could still decide to make
changes.
   ``I think the United States will not be unhappy,'' about the
draft, Goransson said.
