   Film legend Billy Wilder, a six-time Oscar
winner for such films as ``The Lost Weekend'' and ``The
Apartment,'' on Monday night became the 25th recipient of the
Motion Picture Academy's Irving G. Thalberg Award.
   The award goes to ``a creative producer whose body of work
reflects a consistently high quality of motion picture
production.'' It is given only when the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences Board of Directors decides there is a deserving
recipient.
   Wilder, 81, has had a movie career of nearly 60 years, during
which he has been nominated for an Oscar 21 times.
   ``As I look back, I've lived a charmed life,'' Wilder said,
after being honored by the audience with a standing ovation.
   Wilder recounted how he had left Berlin to escape the Nazis, and
was granted a chance to stay in the United States by a consular
official in Mexicali, Mexico, who asked Wilder what he did for a
living. Upon hearing Wilder wrote movies, the official stamped his
passport and said, ``Write some good ones.
   ``That was 54 years ago, I've tried ever since,'' Wilder said.
   In 1961, he became the first person to win three Oscars at once
for producing, directing and co-writing on ``The Apartment,'' best
picture for 1960.
   Wilder's career began in Germany and continued after he fled the
Nazis and came to the United States in 1933. His mother,
grandmother and stepfather died at Auschwitz.
   When he arrived in Hollywood, he spoke fewer than 100 words of
English and took up residence in the ladies' room of the Chateau
Marmont Hotel.
   Wilder won Academy Awards for both directing and co-writing
``The Lost Weekend'' in 1945. He won a screenwriting award for
``Sunset Boulevard'' along with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman
Jr.
   The Thalberg award has been presented 28 times, sometimes more
than once to the same individual.
   Steven Spielberg received it last year. Darryl F. Zanuck won the
award three times and Hal B. Wallis twice, meaning it has gone to
25 people since it was established in 1937. Rules now prohibit a
person from receiving the award more than once.
   Thalberg was an MGM production chief who died at age 37 but left
a legacy of elevating the artistic quality of film with such movies
as ``The Good Earth'' and ``Romeo and Juliet.''

<HEAD>Scientists Discover New Anti-Clotting Enzymes In Leech Saliva</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>

   Israeli scientists have reported discovering
two enzymes in leech saliva that help keep blood from clotting and
may be used to fight blood disorders and facilitate surgery.
   ``We found two enzymes never reported before: collagenase, which
breaks down collagen, and apyrase, which breaks down ADP (adenosine
diphosphate),'' said Meir Rigbi, a professor at the Hebrew
University.
   He said collagen and ADP induce blood cells called platelets to
stick together, the first step in blood clotting. He and research
partners Miriam Orevi and Amiram Eldor have been studying leech
saliva for three years.
   Scientists have known of the fluid's anti-clotting qualities for
a century. Three decades ago, a German scientist isolated and
identified hirudin, a protein contained in leech saliva that now is
considered the most powerful anti-coagulent agent available.
   Progress in research was hampered because of the scarcity of
leech saliva until a new technique was developed by by Rachel
Galun, a research scientist in the Department of Parasitology at
Hebrew University.
   She prepared arginine, a solution of amino acid, and placed it
over a membrane of dried calf intestine. She found that leeches
took to the solution as an alternative to blood.
   After leeches drank their fill scientists squeezed them to force
out the liquid, which also contained saliva, and the thirsty
leeches went back for more.
   ``The technique gave us two advantanges,'' Rigbi said. ``We
start with a much purer material and we can repeat the process
several times.''
   He found several small molecules that also contribute to the
anti-hemostatic process, the researcher said.
   ``It seems that the leech has a battery of components which
inhibit platelet aggregation by a variety of agents,'' he said.
``This is the lesson we are getting. It may also be a lesson for
physicians that a certain balance of drugs is necessary in the
treatment of patients suffering blood disorders.''
   Rigbi said his team found another enzyme called eglin, which he
described as ``an inhibitor of elastase, produced by white blood
cells,'' and is trying to identify its chemical components to
isolate them from the saliva and reproduce them as drugs.
   ``We have grounds to believe we will discover some unknown
compounds,'' he said.
   The research has aroused commercial interest and Eldor, who is
associated with Hadassah Hospital, is working on practical
applications, Rigbi said.

<TEXT>
   Each of the past four Sundays the ghost of
treachery joined Britons at the breakfast table.
   Harold ``Kim'' Philby, the gentleman traitor who spied for the
Soviet Union, granted his first interview to a Western journalist
since defecting to Moscow in 1963 and it appeared in the Sunday
Times.
   Critics say publication of the four-part interview in the Times,
which has a circulation of 1.4 million, was a propaganda gift to
the KGB. The Soviet secret police agency still employs Philby, now
76.
   For journalist Phillip Knightley the evening of Jan. 19, when he
entered Philby's apartment in Moscow, climaxed 20 years in which he
secretly corresponded with Philby but the master spy repeatedly
refused to see him.
   When he did agree to talk, Philby dropped no bombshells. But the
myriad details reveal an English gentleman who despised his
privileged background, espoused Soviet communism as a Cambridge
University student in the 1930s and penetrated the highest levels
of British intelligence in the Kremlin's service.
   Because of his high contacts in Washington, Philby was able to
betray the whole Western alliance. He sent many Western agents to
their deaths and was even able to head off the defection of a
Soviet diplomat who threatened to expose him.
   The most controversial point in the interview is Philby's
contention that British intelligence let him defect rather than
face an embarrassing public trial.
   He told Knightley he suffered severe self-doubt after fleeing to
Moscow and began drinking heavily.
   ``Doubt is a terrible thing,'' he said. ``Had I done the right
thing? You see, I never swallowed everything (about Soviet
communism). I never took it ALL in.''
   Philby said he has found peace and a happy fourth marriage, to a
Russian woman, feels at home in the Soviet Union, and believes
today's England would be a foreign country to him.
   ``No faith? Come, come,'' he said. ``Only a fool would deny me
my faith.''
   He likes to keep in touch with British gossip, listens to the
BBC, does the Times of London crossword and misses English mustard.
   Ever the English gentleman, he greeted Knightley at his door
with a cheerful: ``Come on through, dear chap.''
   ``I don't like deceiving people, especially friends, and
contrary to what some people believe I feel very badly about it,''
he said in the interview. ``But then, decent soldiers feel badly
about the necessity of killing in wartime.''
   The unmasking after Philby had been under suspicion for 12 years
climaxed a nightmare episode for British intelligence.
   It began in 1951 with the defection of top spies Guy Burgess and
Donald McLean and reverberated into the 1980s with the revelation
that Anthony Blunt, another upper-class Englishman, had been
unmasked as a traitor secretly and went unpunished.
   When Philby defected, Blunt was given immunity from prosecution
in exchange for information. He later became art adviser to Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Blunt died in 1983 but the scandal continues to shake the
intelligence establishment. There are allegations that the late Sir
Roger Hollis, director of the MI5 intelligence service from 1956 to
1965, also worked for the KBG.
   Some commentators feel things have gone too far.
   ``These treacheries marked the end of a certain idea which the
British upper classes once entertained of themselves. But all that
is over now. Its legacy, unfortunately, is increased cynicism and
incipient paranoia,'' Anthony Hartley wrote in The Sunday Telegraph.
   Others ridiculed Philby's notion that he was allowed to defect.
Michael Mates, a member of Parliament from the governing
Conservative Party, told the Sunday Times the defection caused much
greater scandal than Philby's arrest would have.
   Knightley came in for some snide remarks. Hartley urged his
colleagues to forget the traitors and not make ``journalistic
pilgrimages to Moscow.'' The Observer said his story was more
appropriate for Izvestia, the Soviet government daily, than a
British newspaper.
   Tony Loynes of the media magazine U.K. Press Gazette, however,
said Knightley had done ``the kind of thing every journalist dreams
of.''
   Knightley wrote: ``Why give publicity to a self-confessed
traitor? Because unless we understand the motives and compulsions
of Philby and his ilk, then we will have learned nothing from the
affair.''

   Here is a chronology of events in the hijacking of Kuwait
Airways Flight 422:
   April 5 _ The Boeing 747 with 112 people aboard, including three
members of the Kuwaiti royal family, is hijacked on a flight to
Kuwait from Bangkok and diverted to Mashhad in northeastern Iran.
The Arab hijackers demand freedom for 17 pro-Iranian extremists
jailed in Kuwait for their convictions in the bombings of the U.S.
and French embassies there in 1983. They threaten to blow up the
plane if the demand is not met. Kuwait refuses. One passenger with
heart condition is released. Kuwait asks Iran not to allow the
plane to take off.
   April 6 _ Kuwait sends a team to Iran to negotiate with the
hijackers but vows not to yield to their demands. The hijackers
release 24 women passengers and call a doctor on board to treat
passengers they describe as ``unwell.''
   April 7 _ The hijackers release 32 more hostages and again
threaten to blow up the plane if security forces try any move
against it. The plane is refueled after hijackers shoot at airport
security and threaten to force the plane to take off with fuel
tanks near empty.
   April 8 _ The plane leaves Mashhad but is refused permission to
land in Beirut and Damascus, despite pleas from the pilot who says
the fuel tank is nearly empty. After seven hours in the air, the
plane lands at Larnaca, Cyprus.
   April 9 _ The hijackers kill a Kuwaiti security guard on the
plane and toss his body to the tarmac after their demands for fuel
are not met. The pilot says captives are being beaten. The PLO's
deputy director in Cyprus and two Cypriot officials go to the plane
and talk with the hijackers, who free another captive.
   Sunday _ Negotiations with PLO officials continue. The hijackers
threaten a ``slow and quiet massacre'' and say they'll force the
pilot to take off and crash into the Kuwaiti royal palace if
demands are not met. In Lebanon, the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad
terrorist group threatened to kill kidnapped foreign hostages if
any attempt is made to storm the plane.
   Monday _ The hijackers kill a second captive, identified as a
Kuwaiti security officer, and dump his body on the tarmac. A
passenger tells airport officials via radio that the hijackers have
threatented to shoot all of the passengers if the plane is not
refueled.

   Once the junior partner in U.S.-Canadian
business relations, Canadian entrepreneurs are becoming more
aggressive in investing in the United States. In fact, in the last
10 years, Canadian investment in the United States has grown faster
than U.S. investment in Canada. Here is a report on the situation.

<TEXT>
   Retailing magnate Robert Campeau's $6.6 billion
takeover of the Federated Department Store empire topped a surge in
Canadian investment south of the border.
   The Campeau Corp. deal last month was the largest Canadian
takeover in the United States. For Campeau, who left his native
Sudbury, Ontario, with an eighth grade education and retains a
slight French-Canadian accent, it surpassed his $3.6 billion
acquisition of New York-based Allied Stores Corp. in 1986.
   Canadian investment in the United States has encompassed prime
real estate from Manhattan to Minneapolis, railways, pulp and paper
mills, oil wells, telecommunications and many other industries.
   Here are some examples:
   _ The Reichmann brothers of Toronto _ Paul, Albert and Ralph _
control 8 percent of Manhattan's office space, including the World
Financial Center and Battery Park City, through their Olympic and
York Developments Ltd.
   _ Northern Telecom, a subsidiary of BCE Inc., which includes
Bell Canada, is the second-largest telecommunications manufacturer
in the United States with 14 Nortel plants and about 23,000
American employees.
   _ Imasco Ltd. of Montreal owns the Hardee's fast-food chain and
830 Peoples Drug Stores in the United States; Seagram recently
bought Tropicana orange juice from Beatrice Foods; Canadians Ken
Thomson and Conrad Black publish dozens of U.S. newspapers; and the
forestry and paper empires of Noranda and MacMillan Bloedel extend
across the border, as does the industrial might of Alcan Aluminium.
   Canada and the United States form the world's largest trading
partnership, and a majority of the Fortune 500 companies long have
operated above the 49th parallel.
   But until recently, Canada had been relegated to junior partner.
As recently as 1975, direct Canadian investment in the United
States stood at just $5.4 billion.
   By the end of 1986, however, this had soared to $29 billion, and
the Canadian stake is now closer to $40 billion, according to
Canadian government statistics.
   The 1986 figure compares with $55 billion worth of direct U.S.
investment in Canada, and the gap is closing.
   ``Over the past 10 years, Canadian investment in the U.S. is
growing faster than U.S. investment in Canada,'' said business
management professor Alan Rudman of the University of Toronto, a
specialist in the topic.
   He cited 20 percent annual growth in Canadian investment in the
United States, compared with 7 percent growth in the other
direction. By the early 1990s, the amounts will be equal, he
predicted.
   ``What's happened is that in the past 20 years the Canadian
economy has matured, and our business sector has become world
class.''
   Rudman said 70 percent of Canada-U.S. trade is conducted by
multinationals _ 22 based in the United States and 21 in Canada _
and 30 percent of the volume is from General Motors, Ford,
Chrysler, and their Canadian subsidiaries.
   Meanwhile, Canada's overall share of investment in the United
States actually has declined from 20 percent to 8 percent in the
past 12 years, Rudman said, because Europeans and Japanese have
been pouring dollar holdings back into U.S. businesses.
   Many of those foreign acquisitions have alarmed Americans, but
the Canadian invasion has met little opposition. ``Canadian firms
blend in so well they cause little hostility,'' said Rudman.
   Flushed with success at netting Federated _ more than 650 stores
in 15 chains, including the tony Bloomingdale's _ Campeau told a
news conference in New York:
   ``I consider myself a North American. What I like about the
United States is a more wide-open private enterprise system where
there is less interference by government than there is in Canada.''
   That will remain the case for Canadians under a bilateral Free
Trade Agreement to take effect next January if ratified by Congress
and Parliament. Canadian investors will enjoy unfettered access in
the United States, but any U.S. investment over $150 million will
come in for scrutiny by Ottawa.
   Other attractions for Canadian investors include a market 10
times bigger and lower taxes.
   Campeau, 63, the youngest of seven children, runs his real
estate and retailing empire from offices in Manhattan and Toronto.
Father of six, he lives in Toronto with his second wife in a
11,000-square foot mansion with an Olympic-sized swimming pool.
   A personal friend of former Premier Pierre Trudeau, a fellow
French-Canadian, Campeau became the federal government's biggest
landlord after building 40 percent of the government-occupied
office space in Ottawa.
   ``He got too big for Canada,'' said analyst Don Tigert of
investment brokers Burns Fry Ltd.

<TEXT>
   In deciding to pursue a new courtship
with its oil-producing competitors, OPEC is betting that such
nations as Mexico, Norway and China are ready for a historic shift
in global oil relations.
   At stake is the future direction of oil prices, which have
fallen steadily this year, partly due to increases in supply from
non-OPEC nations.
   Leaders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
this week are inviting government representatives from at least
seven independent oil-producing nations to meet with five OPEC oil
ministers in Vienna, where OPEC keeps its headquarters, on April
23. All 13 OPEC members are to meet two days later.
   The invitation, announced by a committee of five OPEC oil
ministers on Saturday, is a clear acknowledgement by the cartel
that it alone no longer can exert enough control over oil supplies
to keep prices up.
   OPEC's president, Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, said the cartel
simply wanted to discuss ``methods of cooperation'' with non-OPEC
producers. But the meeting probably will give rise to talks on oil
production cuts intended to boost prices.
   OPEC has an official target price for its oil of $18 a barrel,
but little, if any, of its exports is fetching more than $15 a
barrel. The loose association of oil-producing states has in past
years been unable to prevent many of its own members from
underselling.
   For much of the past six years, OPEC has responded to declining
prices and a buildup of surplus by cutting its production. Although
this sometimes has provided a temporary boost to the market, OPEC
over time has suffered an erosion both of prices and exports.
   The lower OPEC's output has fallen, the less influence it has
carried in the market and the more its poorer members, such as
Nigeria and Indonesia, have suffered.
   Now the cartel is hoping that the prospect of further decline in
prices this year will move non-OPEC oil producers to cooperate by
sharing the financial burden of restraining oil supplies.
   Oil production by non-OPEC nations has risen to 28 million
barrels a day from 22 million a day in 1979. In that time, OPEC's
output has tumbled from about 31 million barrels daily to 17.5
million.
   Mexico has indicated it wants to improve cooperation in
restraining oil supplies, but it is unclear how many other
independent producers _ particularly the larger ones _ want to cut
a deal with OPEC.
   The United States, the world's second-largest oil producer, is
virtually certain to avoid any sort of cooperation with OPEC, as is
Britain, whose North Sea oil makes it a major factor in the market.
   The world's No. 1 producer, the Soviet Union, has shown little
inclination to act in concert with OPEC.
   Those that have expressed interest recently _ including Egypt,
Malaysia, Brunei, Oman and Angola _ are mostly small producers with
little room to reduce their production.
   Two years ago, OPEC held meetings with representatives of
Mexico, Egypt and several other smaller producers in a vain attempt
to agree on joint production cuts. OPEC was told that it must
reduce its output first before the independents would consider a
response in kind.
   Other independent producers include Norway and China.
   The problem for OPEC then and now is that some of its members _
notably cartel leader Saudi Arabia _ simply do not want to continue
the tactic of reducing production without firm pledges from
producers outside OPEC. The Saudis, backed by their allies on the
Arabian Peninsula, think it's more important to preserve their
current share of world oil exports than to defend a fixed oil price
most OPEC members ignore anyway.
   Even so, OPEC has signaled that it is ready to make a fresh
attempt to change global oil relations by drawing independent
producers into an agreement.
   OPEC President Lukman told reporters he saw an important
difference between the current situation and that of two years ago.
   ``The major difference is that non-OPEC have, on their own,
realized the need to cooperate ... and they have made approaches
voluntarily ... to get together with us,'' he said.
   In this industry of maverick nations, however, many obstacles
remain for an internally divided OPEC trying to bridge differences
with independents.

   Michael Douglas won the Oscar as best actor
Monday night for his role as a ruthless inside trader in ``Wall
Street,'' while ``The Last Emperor,'' a tragic epic of modern
China, captured seven awards, including one for Italian director
Bernardo Bertolucci.
   Best supporting performers at the 60th annual Academy Awards
were Olympia Dukakis, as the outspoken Italian mother with a
wayward husband in ``Moonstruck,'' and Sean Connery, as the
hard-fisted, incorruptible Chicago beat cop in ``The Untouchables.''
   Douglas, who also starred in last year's box-office smash
``Fatal Attraction,'' thanked his father, actor Kirk Douglas, for
helping ``a son step out of his father's shadow.''
   Douglas' award was presented by Marlee Matlin, a deaf actress
who won last year's Oscar. She has been taking speech lessons, and
after signing her opening remarks she named all the nominees to
prolonged cheers.
   ``Emperor'' had the most nominations with nine from the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and picked up awards for
direction, costumes, original score, art direction, cinematography,
sound and editing. The sweeping story of China's last imperial
ruler had been widely favored to win the most honors, including
best picture.
   ``OK, Michael, let's go!'' a jubilant Miss Dukakis whooped after
accepting the gold statuette. The reference was to her cousin,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who is seeking the
Democratic nomination for president.
   Connery, Hollywood's original James Bond, addressed his
acceptance to the audience, his friends ``and a few enemies'' and
put in a fervent plea for an end to the strike by movie and TV
writers, which has stalled production and disrupted preparations
for the Oscar show.
   The best original movie song of 1987 was ``The Time of My Life''
from ``Dirty Dancing.''
   The actress category sparked the most interest this year, with
many critics picking Cher for her role as a widow who discovers
love in ``Moonstruck.'' Glenn Close was a strong contender, as was
Sally Kirkland, as the faded Czech actress in ``Anna.'' Also
nominated were Holly Hunter for ``Broadcast News'' and two-time
winner Meryl Streep for ``Ironweed.''
   The first prize of the night, for best visual effects, went to
``Innerspace,'' a Steven Spielberg-produced fantasy about a test
pilot reduced to microscopic size and accidentally injected into
the body of a grocery clerk.
   The award for best animated short film went to ``The Man Who
Planted Trees.'' ``Young at Heart'' was best documentary short
subject and ``The Ten-Year Lunch: The Wit and Wisdom of the
Algonquin Roundtable'' was best documentary feature. Best live
action short film was ``Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall.''
   More than 1,000 movie fans had packed bleachers hours in advance
to cheer celebrities arriving at the Shrine Auditorium for the
ceremonies, where much of the excitement focused on whether Cher
would triumph as best actress.
   Many in the crowd wore shorts and T-shirts, ready for
temperatures that rose into the 90s. But the most visible of the
lot were seven 30ish women with teased blond hair. They carried
rubber daggers and wore long white dresses with ``Fatal
Attraction'' printed on the chest in red. One had come from Maui,
another from Denver.
   ``We're pulling for Glenn Close to win,'' one of the women said
in referring to the actress's nomination for her portrayal of the
vengeful spurned lover in that movie.
   Comedian Chevy Chase was host for the festivities, carried on
live national television by ABC and also broadcast widely overseas.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 600 poor families made poorer
by Panama's political and economic crisis have taken over a stretch
of seaside landfill and covered it with precarious shacks.
   The shanty town, a half mile from the ruins of the colonial city
sacked and burned by pirate Henry Morgan in 1671, has swollen
rapidly since 60 families ``invaded'' the privately-owned land
before dawn on March 25.
   Their takeover is a headache for the regime of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega and a dramatic example of the devastation the
nation's crisis has wrought on the poor, most of whom lived
hand-to-mouth even in the best of times.
   Noriega, as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, is the
power behind the civilian government. After Noriega was indicted on
drug trafficking charges in the United States, Washington imposed
economic sanctions on Panama, hoping its action and months of civil
unrest would oust Noriega. Although the sanctions have bankrupted
the nation's economy, Noriega remains in power.
   ``We were obliged by necessity to act,'' said Marcelino de
Gracia, one of five organizers of the takeover. Each of the
squatter familes has staked out a 10-by-15 yard plot with rope,
wire, ribbon or knotted strips of cloth.
   De Gracia, a 29-year-old unemployed tire salesman, lives with
his wife Yadilia and their two infant children in a shanty made of
mangrove poles, cardboard, a shower curtain, palm fronds and a
sheet of corrugated zinc. It, like hundreds of other shacks spread
over the seized 30 acres, is built on reclaimed land that until two
years ago was a garbage dump.
   The indigent community is bordered by a foul-smelling tidewater
tributary on which float bloated fish poisoned by raw sewage.
   Part of the camp was carved out of an auto graveyard. The rusted
bodies and tattered interiors provide building materials,
furnishings and a tetanus trap for the approximately 3,000 children
living there.
   The dump has fostered a local population of raccoons, which have
augmented the squatters' diet. Skins were tacked on the walls of
several shacks.
   De Gracia said camp dwellers dig clams on the edge of their
settlement and catch lizards and armadillos as well as the
ring-tailed mammals.
   ``Nothing gets out of here alive,'' he said. ``Whack, and into
the pot.''
   De Gracia said a census shows about 570 families comprising
almost 4,000 people lived in the camp as of April 4.
   They draw water from seven faucets along a dirt road bordering
the camp, which sits off Avenida Cincuentenario about five miles
east of downtown.
   Elma Sierra, Olivia Ramos and Anastasia Vega stood around a
smoky campfire in front of Ms. Sierra's shack. Rice boiled in a
blackened pot.
   ``Arroz `pelado,''' (`bald' rice), she said disparagingly, using
the slang for the grain unaccompanied by beans or meat. ``We don't
know what beans look like any more.'' This rice was donated by a
nearby church.
   The three women, all on their own, have 11 children among them.
They said many recent arrivals are single mothers.
   Ms. Ramos admitted to trying to steal a loaf of bread that
morning from a nearby grocery, many of which are owned by immigrant
Asians.
   ``The Chinaman almost took my head off,'' she said, exhibiting
fingernail scratches streaking her neck. ``I know it's wrong, but
my kids have to eat.''
   Almost six weeks into the gravest political and economic crisis
in Panamanian history, the women, like most others in the camp, are
desperate.
   They have virtually no money, have been kicked out of the rooms
they previously rented and see no prospects that things will soon
improve enough to allow them to return to their menial or domestic
jobs.
   They all cursed Noriega. Told that a newspaper supportive of the
regime had dubbed the settlement ``Not One Step Backward'' _
Noriega's slogan in his battle with the United States _ they all
but spat their disgust.
   The land is owned by the Chanis family, a clan of doctors and
statesmen prominent for several generations. They do not intend to
sit by while it is requisitioned by the masses.
   ``The seizure took us by surprise,'' said Dr. Rolando Chanis.
``We await adequate action by authorities to correct the
situation.''
   De Gracia, whose family had been sharing his mother-in-law's
two-room apartment with seven others, said he organized the
takeover along with four friends with whom he regularly played
volleyball.
   ``In the first days, with just 60 families, we feared a move to
dislodge us,'' he said. ``But the news circulated fast, and with
the country the way it is, people poured in. It is another thing to
disloge 570 families. They'd have to think twice about trying
that.''
   Any move against the squatters on behalf of the landowners would
contradict official propaganda. Noriega's regime portrays the
crisis as a confrontation between good, underpriveleged and
nationalistic Panamanians and bad, wealthy ``sell-outs'' conspiring
with Washington to subjugate the isthmus.

<HEAD>Liberace's License Fetches $4,150 In Second Day of Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberace's California driver's license,
expected to garner no more than $200, fetched $4,150 in the second
day of bidding for items from the late pianist's five posh homes.
   ``It was probably the most personal item we sold,'' said Jon
King, a vice president at Butterfield & Butterfield auction house.
The amount bid includes the auctioneer's 10 percent commission.
   The person who bid for the license Sunday was a Liberace fan who
wanted to remain anonymous, King said.
   ``There was a tremendous amount of interest in the license
because of the picture, because of his signature and because of the
very personal nature of it,'' King said. ``Also because it was
something that he daily used.''
   About 2,500 people were present at the start of bidding Sunday.
Total transactions for the day reached approximately $550,000,
exceeding the $445,300 auctioneers expected. Saturday's
transactions hit $660,045, higher than the projected $525,650. The
auction ends Tuesday.
   King estimated that 25 percent of the crowd actually bid on
items, which were bringing in four to five times their estimated
value.
   ``And the flashier the clothing, the higher the bidding,'' King
said.
   A brown-and-white spotted cowhide evening jacket with brown
trousers and matching cowhide shoes was expected to fetch up to
$750 but was purchased for $3,125 by a buyer who wished to remain
anonymous, King said.
   Christie's, the international auction house, organized the sale
of 2,365 Liberace items with Butterfield & Butterfield for the
sale. Among the entertainer's treasures on display at the Los
Angeles Convention Center was a Baldwin grand piano, almost every
surface of the instrument covered with mirrored squares, going for
$46,750 to a London dealer.
   Arnold and Leslie Duke of Washington, D.C., bought the first
item Saturday, a pendant depicting Liberace's profile in sculpted
silver against a blue lapis lazuli background, within a silver
frame.
   It had been estimated to sell for up to $100. The Dukes, who own
a gem and jewelry show that tours the country, paid $3,850.
   ``He was a master showman,'' Arnold Duke said. ``Not only were
we fans, but there was nobody else like him.''
   While many were bidders who purchased items as investments, many
were fans who had come to pay their respects to Wladziu (Walter)
Valentino Liberace, who died Feb. 4, 1987, of complications of
AIDS. He was 67.
   Proceeds of the auction will go to the non-profit Liberace
Foundation for the Performing and Creative Arts, which provides
scholarships at 28 schools and colleges nationwide.

<TEXT>
   A 28-year-old man wanted for five murders in
Maryland has been arrested after being spotted on a television show
on fugitives.
   Carl Dunstrum was arrested late Saturday using warrant murders
issued by Prince George's County in Maryland, said Sgt. Maurice
Howard, a department spokesman.
   In addition to the five killings for which he was sought in
Maryland, Dunstrum was being questioned by Brooklyn detectives in
connection with a sixth killing in that borough, a department
spokeswoman, Sgt. Diane Kubler, said Sunday.
   The Brooklyn victim was Patrick Ford, 17, who was found shot
once in the head on Nov. 26, Kubler said.
   About 30 police raided the basement apartment where Dunstrum was
staying Saturday evening.
   Dunstrum was recently featured on the Fox network television
show ``America's Most Wanted,'' and the show helped lead to his
arrest, Howard said.
   He was one of three New Yorkers wanted in the execution-style
slayings of of four men and a woman Jan. 22 at an apartment complex
in Landover, Md. Police at the time said the slayings appeared to
be drug related.
   One woman shot in the neck survived the attack.

<HEAD>Theater Built By Coal Miners Opens As Fine Arts School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL DE LA GARZA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLLINSVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When this old mining town was booming
with coal, men put aside their picks to construct a theater. Today,
the miners are few but the structure still stands _ now as a school
of performing arts.
   And as a proper salute to the people who worked underground in
Southern Illinois, organizers of the school have dedicated it to a
famous coal miner's daughter, country singer Loretta Lynn.
   ``We want to help promote local talent,'' said artistic director
Ilene Farrell. ``We want to benefit the community. That's what
we're here for, to benefit everyone in the arts.''
   The three-story building, named the Miners Live Theater and
completed in 1918 by members of United Mine Workers Local 264, was
used for labor meetings and vaudeville shows.
   The theater's past is intertwined with the region's coal-mining
history. According to literature about the building, the first mine
in this town of 20,000 residents, 15 miles east of St. Louis, was
established in 1857.
   The industry led to the town's growth ``and by 1886 a man could
walk underground through connecting tunnels between the mines from
one edge of the city limits to the other,'' literature says.
   ``Mining and Collinsville were almost synonymous terms.''
   The coal-mining industry slowly started to wane, however, and in
1969, Miners Live was sold to a private company, which turned it
into a movie house.
   Two years ago, Bloomer Amusement Co. closed the 700-seat theater
and it sat idle until February when Jean Spurlock reopened it and
decided to bring in live acts and launch a performing arts school
and production company.
   The building still needs plenty of renovation. The seats have
red strands of tape covering cracked vinyl upholstery. A walk up
the stairs to the balcony shows walls with peeling paint.
   Elevated box seats flank each side of the stage and an orchestra
pit is located in front.
   By starting the school and hiring big-name entertainers to
perform at the site, Ms. Farrell believes Miners Live will gain
recognition.
   ``My gut feeling is that it's doing well already, that the sky's
the limit,'' she said.
   Ms. Farrell said the fine arts school will feature instruction
in dance, theater, modeling, singing, music, and playwriting. She
has assembled a 25-member staff.
   So far, 50 students have signed up and classes could start this
month at the Loretta Lynn Artistic Art Center and School, she said.
   ``It's going to be a launching pad for some professional careers
_ hopefully,'' Ms. Farrell said.
   The town is glad to see the doors reopen. Ms. Lynn was on hand
April 1 for dedication ceremonies.
   ``It was part of Collinsville culture for so long,'' Ms.
Spurlock said. ``Most people think they have to go to Las Vegas, or
Los Angeles or New York. But like I said, there's nothing in the
Midwest to compare with what's gonna' be happening here.''

   Clothes may make the man, but his tie can reveal
his innermost secrets.
   The color, pattern and style of a man's necktie all provide
clues to his personality and lifestyle, says the Guild of British
Tiemakers, representing 30 manufacturers of ``the British tie,''
that sartorial symbol of the Old Boy Network.
   ``As eyes are reputedly the mirrors of the soul, so ties are the
talisman of the image, a statement by the wearer of their
personality and individuality, an indication of their temperament
and mood, a symbol of the social set in which he does or wants to
belong, a guide to how the wearer sees himself or would like others
to see him,'' according to the guild's survey.
   To help tie wearers and watchers interpret some of the subtle
messages, the guild has issued a guide to ``tiespeak.''
   ``If you want to come across as a strong, confident extrovert
person with strong opinions, choose a brilliantly colored tie or
one with an exaggerated pattern or motif,'' it says.
   ``A man who wears a tie in a plain light color runs the danger
of being a professional Mr. Nice, someone who likes to amuse and
entertain, an arranger of matters rather than a doer.''
   The ``more glowing'' the color of a tie, the more
money-motivated the wearer is likely to be, the guide says. A plain
dark tie, on the other hand, indicates a secretive man who keeps
more than his tie close to his chest.
   The guide says a tie with light and dark stripes of equal width
is the mark of a fence-sitter.
   Wide, light stripes on a dark background suggest the wearer
thinks the best of people and accepts them at face value, while
pessimists generally go for wide, dark stripes on a light
background.
   Multicolored, multiwidth stripes indicate someone who'd love to
do something daring _ if only he dared.
   A striped tie also can blurt out which side of the Atlantic
Ocean a man hails from. American tie stripes run from the right
shoulder down toward the left, the opposite of those on a European
tie.
   A tie with dark spots on a light background indicates ``a
wheeler-dealer,'' while light spots on a dark background suggest
``a sheep in wolf's clothing,'' the guide says.
   ``Small, neat geometric patterns are taken to indicate a
planner, a man who likes to create order out of chaos, probably a
good administrator,'' it says.
   A small paisley pattern suggests an upholder of tradition, while
a large paisly print suggests a hedger of bets.
   Ties give away other secrets.
   In Britain, a man's personal history can be traced through the
ties in his closet, revealing his school, club and military
background.
   Every British school has its own design, usually striped with
the school colors, which every schoolboy wears as part of his
uniform.
   Upon graduation he moves up to an ``Old School Tie,''
identifying his alma mater. He also may collect a regimental tie,
with symbolic colors and crests.
   The colors of the Royal Military Academy's tie, for example,
represent the ingredients of gunpowder _ yellow for sulphur, blue
for saltpeter and black for carbon. The Royal Tank Corps tie
represents the brown mud, red blood and green fields of Flanders,
the World War I battlefield.

   Country singer Johnny Cash completed a
three-city tour in Kansas that had been delayed last month because
of bronchial problems, and says he's feeling fine.
   ``I believe they're all cleared up. I feel better than I have
felt in a long time,'' Cash said.
   Cash's voice was resonant Saturday night in two sold-out
performances at the Ottawa Municipal Auditorium, which followed
concerts Thursday in Emporia and Friday in Independence. Cash will
rest for about 10 days before traveling to London to perform.
   ``A reporter for the London Daily Mirror said the Daily Sun
headline said, `Johnny Cash will never sing again,''' joked Cash,
who spent 10 days recovering in a hospital in Palm Springs, Calif.
   Cash, 56, who has been performing more than 30 years, said he
plans to keep up his pace of about 100 concerts of a year.
   ``I really enjoy it,'' he said. ``As long as people come to hear
us, I'm going to be out there.''

   Dallas Cowboys running back Herschel
Walker said tackling dance moves is tricker than dodging
linebackers, but his ballet debut was an unqualified success.
   About 1,300 people attended the season finale of the Fort Worth
Ballet's ``story series'' _ well above the usual numbers for a
Sunday afternoon performance _ to see the Heisman Trophy winner
perform.
   The 223-pound Walker received a warm reception for his part in
``Webern Pieces,'' a modern ballet performed with principal dancers
Maria Terezia Balogh and Joseph Malbrough.
   ``When you play football you have a helmet to hide behind and
nobody can see your eyes,'' Walker said. ``But it's a lot different
out there on the stage. In football, you can improvise if you make
a mistake, but if you do it here everyone knows it.''

   Pop singer Engelbert Humperdinck said in an
interview published today that his career almost ended last year
when he developed asthma.
   ``I tried singing with it and I'd be in a state of collapse _
gasping for breath,'' he was quoted as telling Woman Magazine. ``I
really thought my career was over. I used to throw up because I
couldn't catch my breath.''
   But the 51-year-old singer, who has his own show in Las Vegas,
Nev., said a course of acupuncture cured him and set him back on
the road with a new album and a British tour that starts this month.
   Humperdinck was quoted as saying he was dealing with ``a few''
lawsuits at the moment _ one price of success in America.
   ``People find it an easy thing just to sue you,'' he was quoted
as saying. ``Lawyers do it on a percentage of the `winnings.' They
are ambulance chasers over there.
   ``That's the way they make their money _ off people who are
successful, which is absolutely disgusting.''

   Folk singer Raffi says he refuses to
capitalize on the 12-year success of his self-produced album of
children's music by endorsing toys and other kiddie products.
   ``I just believe that the music is important in and of itself. I
don't want its value to be diminished by doing commercial things
that have nothing to do with music,'' Raffi said in an interview
published Sunday in The Tennessean.
   ``Especially with children I have to be careful, because these
children feel strongly about me and look up to me and it's so easy
to exploit them in terms of what they want to be,'' he said.
   The former Toronto coffeehouse singer's 1976 ``Singable Songs
for the Very Young'' made him a favorite with the Sesame Street
set. He's best known for such tunes as ``Bathtime,'' ``Shake Your
Sillies Out'' and ``Rise and Shine.''

   Good day care is expensive for working
parents, admits baby guru Dr. Benjamin Spock, and he says
government and industry are lagging in subsidizing child-care
programs.
   ``There's no reason that the richest country shouldn't spend
money (on day care) when they spend trillions of dollars on nuclear
arms,'' Spock said at a forum Saturday at Harvard University's
Graduate School of Design.
   Spock, 84, who wrote his first book about child care in the
1940s, said, ``I still emphasize the child's formative years, but I
can't stop the tidal wave of women going to work.
   ``But there are things to mitigate it, to make it work out less
harmful,'' he said, suggesting flexible hours and shorter work days
as possible ways for parents to spend more time with their children.

   Polar explorer Will Steger and his
dogsled team greeted well-wishers at a farewell picnic as he and
five other adventurers prepared to begin a 2,000-mile
south-to-north traverse of Greenland this week.
   Steger, 43, of Ely, is the wilderness guide who in 1986 led the
first unsupported dogsled assault to the North Pole.
   The Greenland crossing, expected to take two months, will serve
as a test run for his seven-month International Trans-Antarctica
Expedition scheduled for August 1989. That journey will be an
unprecedented 5,000-mile dogsled traverse across the width of the
continent.
   ``Greenland is almost identical to the ice cap we'll have in
Antarctica,'' Steger said Sunday. ``For that reason, it's perfect
training.''
   Steger, his crew and 32 sled dogs will fly Wednesday by cargo
plane from Ottawa, Canada, for Narssarssuag, in southern Greenland.

<HEAD>Industrialist Arrested In Banco Ambrosiano Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 77-year-old Milan industrialist has been
served with an arrest warrant in connection with Italy's biggest
postwar banking scandal, the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano,
Italian newspapers reported.
   The reports on Sunday said Anna Bonomi Bolchini, financier and
member of a noted Milanese family, was told that because of her age
she would not be jailed while the probe continues but instead must
report once a week to Milan police.
   She was reportedly charged with complicity in fraudulent
bankruptcy.
   The reports charged that Roberto Calvi, president of the bank,
transferred several million dollars into a Swiss bank account held
by Bonomi Bolchini shortly before Banco Ambrosiano's collapse.
   Calvi's body was found hanging under a London bridge in June
1982.

<HEAD>Jackson, Gore Conciliatory; Cuomo Still Draws Attention</HEAD>

elaborating on draft.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. sounded
conciliatory notes Sunday as they campaigned for support in New
York's Democratic presidential primary, a contest in which the
active candidates often had to compete for attention with
non-candidate Mario Cuomo.
   Meanwhile, the front-runner in the contest, Gov. Michael Dukakis
of Massachusetts, took the day off to celebrate Greek Easter with
his family.
   Also taking a day off was Vice President George Bush, whose path
to the Republican presidential nomination is clear of serious
opposition. While GOP rival Pat Robertson remains in the race, the
former television evangelist has conceded he has no chance to
overcome Bush's long lead in the race.
   Gore and Jackson were interviewed on the CBS show ``Face the
Nation,'' and played down their differences, which have appeared
more heated as the New York campaign got under way.
   Jackson also said that if elected president he would not meet
again with Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   He said a meeting he had with Arafat several years ago was ``for
the sole purpose of challenging him to change his posture and move
toward a mutual recognition policy with Israel.''
   That meeting with Arafat has been a focus of criticism of
Jackson by Jewish leaders in New York.
   Gore campaigned in heavily Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn
Sunday and received the endorsement of state Assemblyman Dov
Hikind, who told the crowd, many of them wearing the traditional
black hats of the Hasidim: ``We want to understand when one of the
candidates has embraced Yasser Arafat.''
   At that, the crowd erupted into loud boos.
   Hikind described Gore as ``the only one who has had the courage
to criticize Jackson.'' He said that Dukakis supporters were
``telling us we should reward Dukakis for his silence.''
   In his brief remarks to the crowd, Gore steered clear of comment
about Jackson and told the crowd that in his years in Congress, ``I
have stood fast in support of Israel and a strong U.S.-Israeli
relationship.''
   Gore then took a walking tour for about 10 blocks down 13th
Avenue, a street lined with kosher food shops and a variety of
other small businesses.
   Mayor Edward Koch said earlier in the week that Jewish voters
and other supporters of Israel would ``have to be crazy'' to vote
for Jackson in the primary.
   Gore had made one of the strongest direct attacks of the
campaign on Jackson when he said recently that the nation was
looking for leadership not ``a preacher in the White House.''
   Jackson supporters bristled at the comment and called it racist.
   Asked if he agreed, Jackson said, ``That's not my basic
position. There are race-based questions; his is not a race-based
challenge and I accept it in that spirit, in part, because I
respect Al Gore quite a bit as a person.''
   When asked if he thought Gore was being unfair, Jackson also
demurred.
   ``No, I think Al Gore has too much character to be categorically
unfair,'' he replied.
   While, Gore said he had no intention of altering the aggressive
tone of his campaign, the Tennessee senator said he thought all the
candidates ``have grown'' during the long debate.
   As for his approach to the campaign, Gore said, ``I have no
plans to change my basic campaign posture at all.''
   Jackson spent Sunday morning preaching in the Abyssinian Church
in Harlem, where he delivered a sermon called ``A Letter to Dr.
Martin Luther King.'' He recounted the nation's progress since the
civil rights leader's assassination 20 years ago, and said much
remains to be done.
   He concluded quoting King's wish that all people would one day
join hands and and sing: ``Free at last...Thank God Almighty, we
are free at last.''
   Later, Jackson said he could not look up when he read the quote
because there is still ``a lot of pain and passion in it all.''
   ``All we can do is vow we will continue,'' he told reporters.
``It's not over.''
   Jackson had lunch at a soul food restaurant in Harlem, and
walked for several blocks through the neighborhood, hand in hand
with his wife Jacqueline. Residents called out to him and rushed up
to shake his hand. People called down from their windows, ``Win,
Jesse!'' and ``God bless you!'' as Jackson gave a thumbs-up sign.
   Security around Jackson was intense, with about 20 Secret
Service agents and New York City police officers escorting him
along the sidewalk, along with a phalanx of cameras. Limousines
from the motorcade drove alongside.
   Later, in affluent New Rochelle, Jackson called for racial unity.
   `Even lions and lambs ...don't want the forest set on fire,'' he
told a crowd in affluent New Rochelle. ``If lions and lambs can
find common ground, then blacks and Jews, Hispanics and Italians
can find common ground,'' he said to cheers from the largely black
audience.
   A young white man waved a sign that said ``Jews want peace with
Jesse Jackson.''
   The common ground in New York, as elsewhere in the nation,
Jackson said, lies in economnic issues and the desire to rid the
streets of drugs.
   Meanwhile, former President Richard M. Nixon, interviewed on the
NBC show, ``Meet the Press,'' commented on the New York campaign,
saying, ``Jackson has not been on the side of Jewish issues'' while
all the other candidates ``can't wait but line up for those issues
all the way down the line.''
   Nixon also said Jackson is ``appealing to those who are
restless, despite prosperity. And that is what George Bush must
overcome, and that's why I think it's going to be a close election
rather than a landslide.''
   The former president, driven from office by the Watergate
scandal, said that while he would describe Cuomo and Jackson as
``poets,'' Dukakis would better be compared to ``a word processor.''
   On the other hand, Nixon said of Dukakis, ``he's cool, he's
intelligent, he's tough, he's good in debates. He's going to be a
very formidable candidate.''
   Cuomo, the New York governor whom some Democrats have urged to
get into the presidential race, took the spotlight from the active
candidates on Saturday by announcing he would not endorse anyone
prior to the April 19 vote and calling efforts to draft him
``unproductive and unwise.''
   Did that end the possibility of drafting the governor?
   ``I've ruled it out,'' he said in a telephone call to The
Associated Press.
   But spokesman Gary Fryer said the governor meant that a draft
should not take place, but was not ruling out acceptance of one if
it did occur.
   On Sunday, however, Cuomo said ``I think it is absolutely a
reasonable interpretation to say that if a person says it's wrong,
it's counterproductive, it's unwise, it shouldn't be, then that
means he rejects a draft.''
   When asked if his remarks mean that he would not accept a draft,
Cuomo said, ``I think so.''
   Former New York Rep. Richard Ottinger said Sunday he will
suspend his organized effort to draft Cuomo after receiving a
letter from the governor requesting that he do so. He said,
however, that if it appears there will be no front-runner at the
Democratic convention, the effort would resume.
   ``It doesn't change anything,'' said Dukakis, responding to
Cuomo's latest comment.
   ``I'm going to win New York, I'm going to win Pennsylvania and
I'm going to win the nomination,'' said the Massachusetts governor
who had hoped to get Cuomo's backing before the primary.

   An 18-day ``American Design'' exhibit
staged at the Museum of Arts and Crafts drew 110,000 people, the
highest number of spectators ever to attend a U.S. exhibit in
Hungary.
   The 250 artifacts presented were mostly everyday products
ranging from household appliances to child-care items, from
personal computers to farm tractors. A special unit dealt with
objects of ``the motorized way of life'' and ``office work today.''
   Exhibit manager Ursual Williams said the large turnout was due,
in part, to heavy media coverage of the American product show,
which closed Sunday.
   ``American Design'' will now travel to the cities of Miskolc in
northern Hungary and Kecskemet in central Hungary for 18-day stints
each.

   A bomb believed planted by Tamil
extremists damaged the granite base of a statue of India's first
prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, in the southern Indian city of
Madras, the United News of India reported.
   No one was reported injured in the blast on Sunday, the news
agency said.
   There was no damage to the bronze statue of Nehru, unveiled by
his grandson, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, in December 1987. But
chunks of granite were blown out of the base by the explosion.
   Police told the news agency they found two handbills signed by
the Tamil Liberation Army near the blast site. The group was linked
to a bomb blast on a train in the southern Indian state of Tamil
Nadu in March 1987 that killed at least 22 people and injured 150.
Madras is the capital of the state.
   Tamil speakers in southern India have long resisted efforts by
the government to broaden the use of Hindi, the dominant language
in the north.

<TEXT>
   A new age of television promising
sharper, brighter images on a larger, wider screen with sound as
clean as compact disc recordings is making America's TV broadcast
insdustry excited and nervous.
   This new technology called high definition TV, or HDTV, is the
biggest development in television since the introduction of color
and many American TV station owners are eager to explore its
potential. They also want to make sure they don't get left behind.
   They are watching nervously as competing American interests work
toward developing an HDTV transmission standard for U.S. markets
while the Japanese and Europeans move independently with their own
systems, neither of which is compatible with each other or with
existing U.S. TV sets.
   One of broadcasters' greatest fears is the probability that the
Japanese, who plan to offer HDTV in their own country in 1990, will
begin exporting to the United States HDTV receivers and video
cassette recorders. Such packages could cut over-the-air
broadcasters out of the video equation and threaten their survival.
   ``We don't know how much time it will take'' to develop a system
that can be used by over-the-air broadcasters, said Michael J.
Sherlock of NBC, which is developing a system that improves the TV
picture though not as significantly as HDTV. ``We don't know how
the audience will react, and we don't know how much time we have to
develop our own HDTV.''
   But one thing is certain, he said: ``We broadcasters will have
competition by technically superior systems.
   ``We're fooling ourselves if we don't think the people in the
video cassette, cable and movie industries are going to take
advantage of that,'' he warned in a panel discussion at the
National Association of Broadcasters convention, which began
Saturday and ends Tuesday.
   ``Broadcasters could be put out of business or severely hurt if
we take too long'' to meet the competition with an improved
picture, he said.
   HDTV is the most talked about development at this year's
convention. A room devoted to exhibits of the competing HDTV
systems being developed as well as the Japanese system has provided
most of the TV broadcasters here their first opportunity to see
high definition television.
   The Japanese have been working on HDTV for nearly 20 years, and
they are moving forward quickly. They plan to give a sneak preview
of their system with broadcasts of this summer's Seoul Olympics to
HDTV sets in about 50 big-city department stores throughout the
country.
   The quality of the picture on 35- and 50-inch HDTV screens is
noticeably better than on conventional TV sets. The colors are
brighter and the detail much greater. And because the
width-to-height ratio can be greater, the picture has the panoramic
appearance of a movie theater screen.
   The picture on a standard television set in the United States is
produced by a signal that scans more than 200,000 dots on 525
lines. The Japanese system has 1,125 scanning lines.
   The Japanese system, however, requires more than the space
allocated to TV channels on the electromagnetic spectrum. In Japan,
the HDTV system called Hi-Vision will be transmitted by satellite
to small rooftop antennas, avoiding the bandwidth problem that
would be faced by over-the-air broadcasting. But special HDTV
receivers will be needed to see the enhanced picture.
   A large part of the debate in the United States is whether a
system can be developed that can compress into the standard 6
megahertz TV channel all the electronic information required to
produce HDTV pictures, or whether additional channel space on
another band will be required.
   Some are advocating a transitional approach in which
broadcasters would move first to a system that requires no extra
bandwidth and is compatible with existing TV sets and produces an
improved picture though not as good as HDTV.
   Whichever system is ultimately agreed upon by the U.S. industry,
many technical questions must be answered and trade-offs examined.
Meantime, many TV station executives are nervous.
   ``If you're not scared by HDTV, then you don't understand the
problem,'' said LeBon G. Abercrombie, vice president and general
manager of KMPH-TV, Fresno, Calif.
   ``Within a few short years there are going to be high definition
systems out there for home use in some fashion,'' said Thomas R.
Craddock, an engineer at KKTV-TV in Colorado Springs, Colo.
``Broadcasters are most concerned about how that is going to erode
their audience.''

   The world's largest tick collection could
be headed for a climate-controlled pod in a museum because no one
in the government wants to give the 1 million little blood-suckers
a home.
   The Smithsonian Institution and the National Institutes of
Health can't agree on which one should pay the $200,000 necessary
in fiscal 1989 to keep the government's Acarology Unit in business.
   The unit is home to 1 million tick specimens _ deceased, in case
you were wondering or worrying _ that have been painstakingly
collected by researchers over decades.
   If no agreement is reached by Sept. 30, the ticks will go into
the museum equivalent of cold storage and the lab will be no more.
   It's not your typical tale of government cutbacks, but a
potential tragedy nonetheless, according to entomologists and
health officials who note the tick's role in carrying disease and
the importance of research on the tiny, blood-sucking arachnids.
   ``The unit and the collection are unique, and are the backbone
of tick research in the United States and abroad,'' George
Eickwort, president of the Acarological Society said in a letter
seeking help from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The funding dispute threatens a unique research program overseen
by NIH taxonomist Jim Keirans, who presides over the unit at the
Smithsonian's Museum Support Center in the Washington suburb of
Suitland.
   Public health officials, veterinarians, armed forces physicians
and zookeepers the world over know when they find a tick they can't
identify, Jim Keirans is their man.
   The unit's supporters describe it as the only place on the
planet where researchers can send ticks for identification,
critical to scientists trying to track the more than 20 tickborne
diseases that plague humans:
   Common diseases like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted
fever. More exotic diseases like Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
and Kyasanur forest disease. Other diseases that infect livestock
and wild animals.
   Scientists and a group of congressmen have rallied to the unit's
support, urging NIH to save the lab for the good of the public
health.
   ``The collection and Dr. Keirans have been instrumental in the
accurate identification of tick species which serve as vectors of
disease, including the identification of a new species, Ixodes
dammini, as the principal vector for transmitting Lyme disease,''
Eickwort wrote in his letter to Kennedy.
   The Suitland laboratory was created in 1983 when NIH moved its
tick collection from the Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Hamilton,
Mont., to the Smithsonian.
   From 1984 to 1987, Keirans and his assistant, Richard Robbins,
received 14,113 tick specimens, most from agricultural and
veterinary researchers.
   ``We have received them pinned, we have received them
Scotch-taped, we have received them just dropped in an envelope,''
Keirans said during a recent tour of the spacious and orderly lab.
   The collection became the world's largest with the addition of
the specimens, papers and books of Harry Hoogstraal, head of the
zoology department at a Navy research unit in Egypt for more than
35 years. Hoogstraal was the world's pre-eminent tick expert until
his death in 1986.
   Keirans said the 1983 move came when NIH decided to get out of
medical entomology, the study of insect-borne disease, and focus on
AIDS research. NIH agreed to pay the salaries of Keirans and a
technician for two years; when the agreement expired, it was
extended to September 1988.
   But NIH is no longer interested in having a medical entomologist
housed at the Smithsonian, he said.
   Smithsonian spokesman William Schulz said the museum tried to
raise funds for the tick unit, but never said it would pay for the
facility and never felt there was ``some deadline where we would
take over the staff salaries.''
   John LaMontagne, NIH's director of microbiology and infectious
disease program, sees it differently. He said institute officials
felt that the ticks belonged at the Smithsonian, and ``the
Smithsonian originally said that they were interested in it.''
   ``It's my understanding now that their assessment of it now is
not quite in line with that. I think they get uncomfortable with
the public health and service kind of needs that the collection
implies.''
   NIH officials appointed 11 researchers familiar with the lab to
consider the issue. In March, they concluded that the unit should
be funded by NIH, with the Smithsonian continuing to provide space
and equipment.
   LaMontagne said NIH is looking into several options: financial
support from the Department of Agriculture and Walter Reed Army
Hospital, both heavy users of the unit's taxonomy service; or some
fiscal legerdemain, which would move the unit's funding to another
part of the NIH budget.
   Twenty-two federal legislators, led by Rep. George
Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., wrote last month to Health and Human
Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen, urging NIH to continue funding
the lab.
   Hochbrueckner, whose Long Island district has high incidences of
Lyme disease, which causes temporary paralysis, and tick-borne
babesiosis (a malaria-like fever) has become one of the tick
program's biggest boosters.
   He says that if NIH doesn't want the tick program, someone else
should give it a home.
   ``I don't really care where they stay,'' he said.

   Federal housing officials today announced
plans to find out how many black and Hispanic couples are victims
of ``racial steering'' or other discriminatory treatment in their
search for places to live.
   The first major study of housing discrimination in a decade
would use hundreds of white, black and Hispanic couples as bogus
house-hunters to test the nation's metropolitan rental and real
estate markets.
   ``Racial steering'' occurs when agents steer minorities away
from all-white residential areas.
   ``Despite advances in civil rights, discrimination still exists,
in more subtle ways than before, in many areas,'' said Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce in requesting bids to
conduct the study. The deadline for bidding is May 26, with the
study expected to be completed in mid-1990.
   Pierce said the aim is to increase enforcement against illegal
discrimination. Other officials said the study also could determine
the need for stronger fair-housing legislation.
   The last such study, completed in 1979, used 600 black and white
couples who tried to buy or rent homes or apartments in 40
metropolitan areas across the country.
   It included couples with nearly identical backgrounds, except
for race, who would respond to the same newspaper ads and then fill
out detailed forms reporting their experiences.
   C. Duncan MacRae, HUD's deputy assistant secretary for policy
development and research, said in an interview that the new study
will use similar methods.
   The 1979 study estimated that 27 percent of rental agents and 15
percent of house sellers discriminated against blacks.
Discrimination then was defined as ``failing to provide important,
necessary information to rent or purchase a home.''
   The study concluded that black home buyers who inquired about
four different advertised homes had a 48 percent chance of finding
discrimination in dealing with at least one of them. In the rental
market, 85 percent found discrimination in at least one of four
inquiries about apartments.
   MacRae said the new study will be expanded to include
more-subtle discrimination, differences between discrimination in
cities and suburbs, and discrimination against Hispanics as well as
blacks. There is no plan to include Asian, native American or other
minorities, he said.
   Since the Fair Housing Assistance Program began in 1983,
discrimination claims have declined from about 5,000 complaints a
year to about 4,500 annualy, McRae said. The new study, he said, is
needed to determine whether that decline is significant.
   ``We hope this research will document the existence of housing
discrimination in America, or lack of discrimination _ whatever the
case may be,'' MacRae said.
   The only broad-based studies of discrimination in recent years
have relied on census data rather than the actual experiences of
people seeking to buy or rent living space, he said.
   A study by Douglas Massey, a University of Chicago sociology
professor, concluded last year that most blacks still live in
segregated neighborhoods while Asian and Hispanic minorities have
had more success moving into largely white neighborhoods. Massey
analyzed census date from 1970 and 1980.
   Last June, the National Association of Realtors signed an
agreement with HUD officials pledging that its 750,000 members
around the nation would provide equal access to housing regardless
of race.

   Jesse Jackson, who saw his long-shot White
House ambitions curdle over the course of 24 hours last week,
handled the disappointment with a statesmanlike equanimity that
could ease the Democrats' path toward an autumn unity.
   Now _ win, lose or draw _ Al Gore will set his 1988 legacy in
the eight days before New York's primary. The senator from
Tennessee recently voiced some shrill criticism of Jackson and
Michael Dukakis and party leaders have asked him to stop before
things get ugly.
   Gore began his negative campaign after suffering a string of
miserable defeats, suggesting to Jackson and others that he was
acting out of desperation. Desperation politics, as we have seen
previously this year, is not generally a pretty sight to behold.
   Take Bob Dole. For one marvelous week of February, he boasted a
positive message and a priestly visage and looked for all the world
like a Republican giant-killer. The roof caved in in New Hampshire
and before the clock struck midnight, Dole struck out at George
Bush. Within days he was on the air with anti-Bush ``attack ads.''
   Pat Robertson had no real chance to win the GOP nomination but
when his support dissipated, Robertson nonetheless took it out on
Bush. In one of the more amazing accusations of the year, he
suggested without proof that the Bush campaign had leaked word of
Jimmy Swaggart's immorality so as to hurt Robertson at the polls.
   Jackson has apparently chosen a more cool-headed course.
Following his back-to-back defeats last week In Colorado and
Wisconsin, Jackson kept to the high road, revealing no rancor and
making unmistakable gestures to Jewish voters whose suspicions were
kindled by the ``Hymietown'' and Farrakhan episodes of 1984. He
likes to mock Dukakis as the man with money but no message, but
they agree on many issues and the barbs rarely have gotten more
biting than that.
   Despite insistent baiting from New York Mayor Ed Koch (who said
a Jew would have to be ``crazy'' to vote for Jesse Jackson),
Jackson has kept his serenity.
   ``We are already in a tender situation,'' he said of
black-Jewish relations. ``Responsible leadership must move to heal
people and not to extend their fears.''
   On Sunday, Gore allowed a surrogate _ Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov
Hikind, whose endorsement he had just received _ to attack Jackson.
With the Tennessee senator at his side, Hikind brought up Jackson's
meeting with PLO chief Yasser Arafat, and praised Gore as the only
candidate ``who has had the courage'' to criticize Jackson.
   Later in the day, Gore praised Jackson's statement that if
elected president, he would not meet again with the PLO chief.
Gore, however, couched his approval in terms that called attention
to the earlier meeting, calling that a change in position for
Jackson.
   Jackson's steady 1988 demeanor has won many admirers. Richard
Nixon calls him a ``poet,'' and ``one of the very best (candidates)
of the entire century for either party.''
   ``Jackson has certainly has been a good force in our time,''
says prominent Democratic economist John Kenneth Galbraith. ``He
has given voice to people who previously did not have voice and is
bringing a whole group of new people into the political process.''
   Now, Democratic eyes are on Gore.
   It caught party leaders by surprise to see Gore _ so quiet
throughout the primary season _ turn up the heat on Jackson and
Dukakis. In the days before Dukakis' Wisconsin landslide, ranking
Democrats were content to let nature take its course. Now they are
telling Gore to pull back.
   Gore's people counter that his campaign is doing just what
campaigns were always intended to do: point out the differences
between his priorities, policies, and record and those of his
opponents.
   ``Nothing personal,'' Gore spokesman Arlie Schardt said late
last week.
   Schardt is basically correct. Gore taunts Dukakis for lacking
foreign policy experience and Jackson for having no experience in
office at all. It's pretty tame stuff, but it defies the current
catechism of the party establishment, which is this:
   Jackson is too liberal, too inexperienced (and maybe too black)
to beat Bush. Gore and Dukakis, among others, both had a chance to
beat him and thank heaven Dukakis has done it. Now it's time to
quiet down, deliver the nomination to Dukakis and get on with party
unity _ with Gore and Jackson both needed to build bridges across
the South.
   Gore obviously wants one more chance to emerge as the
alternative to Jackson. If the attacks and $1 million worth of TV
time are working, he'll likely keep it up.
   But if he doesn't see a quick improvement in the pre-election
polls, Gore will probably tone down the rhetoric this week and go
softly unto the night. Gore, just turned 40, is generally thought
to be looking ahead at 1992 and beyond _ so common sense says he
won't want to leave a bad taste in anybody's mouth.

   Every two hours or so on a normal working day,
an aide to Rep. Pat Roberts goes to a wooden board on the wall of
his office and posts the latest crop prices at the grain elevator
back home in Dodge City.
   Roberts, R-Kan., is a one-issue congressman: ``The whole thing
is agriculture,'' says press secretary Fred Zillinger, gesturing
matter-of-factly to an office festooned with pictures of
wheat-growing country and toy models of tractors.
   Only a few steps down the hall are the House Agriculture
Committee hearing rooms. Handy, since Roberts haunts the committee
more than most lawmakers.
   ``The allegation that I'm a one-issue congressman, or a
full-time aggie, has at least some bearing in fact,'' says Roberts,
who represents the western two-thirds of Kansas, a vast wheat
factory sometimes called America's Ukraine.
   He has steadily gathered seniority and is now viewed as a force
to be reckoned with, especially in view of rising U.S. dependence
on farm exports.
   In recent weeks, Roberts has pushed hard for a so-called
triggered marketing loan for wheat, feed grains and oilseeds, which
could boost exports but at a $500 million price tag.
   The plan, part of a sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill, figures to
be in the spotlight again as the measure heads for final floor
action, perhaps as early as next week. Meanwhile, the drive has
furnished a showcase for the rhetorical flourish that Roberts has
brought to the panel.
   At one point, Roberts told wary budget watchdogs that the
subsidy would amount to nothing more than a bargaining chip in
international trade talks, never go into effect and thus cost
taxpayers nothing.
   ``We're not asking you to take her home,'' Roberts told a
House-Senate conference committee. ``We're just asking you to dance
with her. Then at closing time you can sneak out the back door.''
   The crack was typical of the Roberts flair for daubing color on
an otherwise gray farm debate.
   One steamy Washington night last summer, Agriculture Committee
Chairman E. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, tried to ease a farm credit
bill through the panel without long debate. Some lawmakers
suggested he was attempting to ``railroad'' the measure.
   That put Roberts in mind of a desperado band that once roamed
the high plains of western Kansas.
   ``I'm from Dodge City, the home of the Dalton Gang,'' he
declared. ``Out there we stop trains to see what's in 'em before we
let 'em through.''
   Another Roberts remark mirrored farm frustration in the early
1980s when rural debt was skyrocketing and the Reagan
administration was taking a cautious approach to increases in
federal payment programs.
   Air Force One, declared Roberts, had better not fly too low over
Kansas or it was liable to get ``a pitchfork in the belly.''
   A Marine Corps veteran with bald dome and granite features,
Roberts launches his barbs in flat Kansas accents bearing a marked
resemblance to those of Sen. Bob Dole _ who once represented
Roberts' 1st District.
   ``There's a lot of Bob Dole in his style,'' says Rep. Edward R.
Madigan, R-Ill., top Republican on the Agriculture Committee.
``Pat's an old pro. I don't think anyone around here knows farm
programs any better than he does.''
   ``He has some of Bob Dole's incessant desire to be cute and to
make his point in a hard-biting kind of way,'' says Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan.
   Roberts long has been a thorn to environmentalists. He sponsored
a plan urged by food processors to bar states from setting
pesticide regulations tougher than those of the federal government.
He also fought for exemptions to USDA's sodbuster program designed
to curb soil erosion.
   Those same environmentalists say, however, that it is hard to
stay mad at him.
   ``It's nifty to find someone in Washington like him who doesn't
hold grudges because Washington is full of grudges,'' says Maureen
Hinckle, National Audubon Society lobbyist.
   She says that once when an Agriculture Committee aide barred her
from a hearing on grounds the room was full, Roberts put aside
their numerous past skirmishes and ordered: ``Let her in.''
   ``Otherwise I'll have to lie and say she's on my staff,'' he
chortled.

<HEAD>Jackson Questions Hit Home with Young Audience</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WYANDANCH, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How many days a week do you practice
basketball, Jesse Jackson demanded of the young player prodded to
his feet in the packed high school auditorium.
   ``Four to six,'' was the reply.
   ``When you come home at night do you study for four hours? ...
Three hours? ... Two hours?'' Jackson asked.
   The other kids were giggling now, and eventually the boy
admitted to ``maybe'' one hour of studying, with radio on and
occasional calls to his girlfriend.
   That brought Jackson to one of his favorite lectures, on the
opportunities that await those who study hard, the importance of
pushing for all that life holds, of working to rise above
less-than-privileged beginnings.
   Included is a pointed anti-drug and anti-alcohol message that
Jackson has been hammering home for years to youngsters at schools
across the country.
   ``What does it matter if opportunity is there ... if you're to
drunk to stagger through the door?'' Jackson asked. ``What does it
matter if your classmate is black or white if you can't get along
with anybody?''
   The motivational talk is not part of Jackson's regular campaign
pitch, but talking to high school students is part of his campaign
schedule, as it has been a big part of his lecture tours in the
past.
   And fighting drugs is a big part of his campaign message. In
talking to the young people, he always includes a dramatic series
of questions:
   How many people here know someone who has died because of drugs?
Please stand. A smattering always stand up.
   How many know someone who is in jail because of drugs?
   This sometimes brings about half the audience to its feet.
   How many know someone who has tried drugs?
   Virtually the entire audience stands.
   And then Jackson asks, ``How many know someone who has
contemplated suicide?'' As many as half will stand.
   Jackson's call for action against drug use and trafficking gets
a more enthusiastic response than almost anything else he talks
about on the campaign trail.
   Lately the candidate has needled his Democratic opponents, Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, saying they
are following his leadership by making drugs a bigger part of their
own campaign messages.
   `We've never known a threat quite like drugs,'' he told some
4,000 people at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y., on Sunday. In
the old days, black people were threatened by the Ku Klux Klan who
came at night wearing hoods and carrying lynching ropes, he said.
   But now, ``We've lost more lives to dope than to the rope.''
   The audience cheered when Jackson added his punch line: ``Those
who push drugs don't wear hoods _ they are hoods.''
   His standard talk to the high school kids is about more than
just drugs _ it's about self-motivation and the chance to excel in
life.
   At Wyandanch High, he told the youths that they are good
athletes because, `You do well what you do much. There's nothing
wrong with your mind. There's something wrong with your time. ... I
challenge you to use your mind. I challenge you to study. Give your
mind a chance.
   ``As I travel around the country, the rising use of drugs and
babies making babies and suicide is undermining our opportunity,''
he said.
   He typically ends up leading a chant: ``Down with dope, up with
hope. Down with dope, up with hope.''
   The kids, chanting ``Jesse, Jesse,'' mobbed him Sunday as he
left the stage.
   ``He touched my hand,'' squealed Regina Ross, 17.
   What did she and her friend think of his talk?
   ``It was very inspirational,'' one of them said. Jackson had
zeroed in on the problems of their world, especially the ``down
with dope, up with hope,'' and the part about ``babies making
babies.''
   ``That's the problem right here in this school,'' said Regina.

   Bill Cosby's $27 million movie turkey
``Leonard Part 6'' gobbled up three Golden Raspberry Awards to lead
the flock in the eighth-annual Oscar Eve parody poking fun at the
year's worst in film.
   ``Leonard,'' which was disowned by Cosby, captured
worst-trophies in picture, screenplay and actor categories from the
Golden Raspberry Award Foundation.
   The Razzie award ceremony Sunday night, 22 hours before the
Academy Awards show was to start, was held at the Hollywood
Roosevelt Hotel, the site of the first Oscar show 60 years ago.
   Pop star Madonna captured her second Razzie crown as Worst
Actress, this time for her performance in ``Who's That Girl?''
   Daryl Hannah's Razzie stock dropped with the 175-member
foundation who voted her Worst Supporting Actress for her role in
``Wall Street.''
   Worst New Star and Worst Supporting Actor awards went to David
Mendenhall for his role as what the foundation described as the
``insufferably whiney son'' of muscle-man Sylvester Stallone in the
arm-wrestling melodrama ``Over the Top.''
   Elaine May, who directed the $35 million mega-bomb ``Ishtar,''
tied for Worst Director with author-director Norman Mailer for his
``Tough Guys Don't Dance'' murder mystery.
   Bruce the shark splashed to victory in the new Worst Special
Visual Effects and Creature Creations category for his
gut-wrenching portrayal of the toothy killer in ``Jaws: The
Revenge.''
   Bruce, who starred in all four ``Jaws'' sagas, also got his
teeth into this year's ``Worst Career Achievement Award.''
   The foundation termed it's winner in the Worst Song competition
an ``over-heated obvious ditty.'' ``I Want Your Sex!'' written by
George Michael, was from ``Beverly Hills Cop II.''
   Winners, if they dare to show up for the ceremony, receive a
trophy of a golf-ball size raspberry glued atop a film reel and
spray-painted with gold.
   The Golden Raspberry Award Foundation consists of film
professionals and critics, as well as frequent film-goers in
California and nine other states.
   ``There are three basic theories of what qualifies as a
Razzie,'' explained John Wilson, foundation president.
   ``First, Hollywood's own measure, how much money did it lose?
Second, a movie that was not supposed to be a comedy that generated
enormous laughs from the audience. `Jaws' was one of those and so
was Norman Mailer's `Tough Guys Don't Dance,' which was laughed off
the screen in Cannes.
   ``The last is how excruciating it is to actually sit through a
film. Does someone have to pay you money or bribe you with popcorn?
`Who's that Girl?' fits into that category,'' Wilson said.

<HEAD>Crops, Livestock Balance Seen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the effects of this year's continued
improvement in the farm economy may be a closer balance between the
crop and livestock sectors, says an Agriculture Department
economist.
   For some time USDA economists have been forecasting that 1988
net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $50 billion to
$55 billion. Last year, with a bulge in livestock profits, net cash
income rose to a record $57 billion _ the difference between gross
cash income and cash expenses.
   Gregory Hanson of the department's Economic Research Service
says 1988 crop receipts may rise 8 percent to 14 percent from last
year's $59 billion to a range of $64 billion to $67 billion.
   Livestock receipts, which were a record of $74 billion in 1987,
may decline to between $71 billion and $74 billion.
   ``While cattle receipts will be the second or third highest on
record, hog and dairy receipts may each fall nearly $1 billion,''
he said. ``Substantial increases in supplies could bring hog prices
down by one-sixth from last year, and poultry prices one-fourth
below two years ago.''
   Meanwhile, farm expenses will end their downward trend of the
last few years. Feed and fertilizer prices may rise 6 percent to 7
percent in 1988, translating into $2 billion of added costs.
Repairs, energy and labor could add another $1 billion, while
interest and livestock purchase may decline by about $1 billion.
   Hanson, writing in the April issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said 1988 will bring ``continued improvement in the farm
sector's balance sheet.'' A slight strengthening of land prices and
a reduction in farm debt of $5 billion to $10 billion will boost
farmers' equity by $10 billion to $20 billion.
   ``The combination of higher crop prices, lower hog and poultry
prices, and higher feed costs is shifting profits from livestock to
crop producers,'' he said.
   Other impacts of higher crop prices, according to Hanson,
include:
   _The turnaround in declining land values coincided with a rise
in corn and soybean prices during the first six months of 1987.
   _With higher crop prices and the related strengthening in land
values, crop farmers have seen larger cash flows and a
stabilization of loan security, or collateral, provided by real
estate assets.
   ``All regions, including the economically hard-hit Delta and
Southern Plains, are likely to have less farm financial stress in
1988,'' he said. ``Roughly 60 percent of loan default problems of
commercial farmers were on primarily crop-producing farms at the
start of 1987.''
   _Capital expenditures are picking up as cash flows improve and
there is confidence in long-run profit potential. In 1988, capital
spending may increase by as much as $1 billion, with spending for
tractors and combines leading the list.
   _Government spending on crop supports are easing as commodity
prices increase. Direct government payments may decline 16 percent
to 20 percent this year to between $13 billion and $15 billion.

   Five Agriculture Department scientists are
being recognized this year for outstanding work during their
careers.
   Terry B. Kinney Jr., administrator of the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said the five will be inducted into
the agency's Science Hall of Fame at ceremonies on June 21 at the
U.S. National Arboretum in Washington.
   Kinney said that each ``has contributed significantly to
agricultural or nutritional progress worldwide and has an
international reputation for scientific excellence.''
   The honors program was begun in 1986 and, with the current
nominees, will include 13 USDA scientists.
   Kinney said the 1988 selections are:
   _Francis E. Clark, retired microbiologist, Soil and Plant
Nutrient Research Unit, Fort Collins, Colo.
   _Edgar E. Hartwig, research agronomist and former research
leader, Soybean Production Research Unit, Stoneville, Miss.
   _Ralph E. Hodgson, retired national program staff scientist for
dairy production, Beltsville, Md., now residing in Chapel Hill, N.C.
   _Hamish N. Munro, senior scientist, USDA Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, Mass.
   _Jose Vicente-Chandler, retired research leader and soil
scientist, Soil and Water Conservation Research Unit, Rio Piedras,
Puerto Rico.

   New Zealand consumers like U.S. peanuts, if
the price is right, says the Agriculture Department.
   The main competition is from Australia, India and China, which
provide peanuts for the ``table nut'' sector, the department said
in its April issue of Foreign Agriculture magazine. But U.S.
``splits'' are preferred by processors of peanut butter.
   U.S. peanuts are liked because they are mechanically harvested
and are bought on the basis of a well-understood grading system,
the report said. Some improvement has occurred as a result of the
rise of the New Zealand dollar against the U.S. dollar, but the
Australian dollar also has dropped sharply against the New Zealand
currency.
   Moreover, the report said, ``U.S. peanuts also face a 10 percent
tariff in New Zealand, while there is no duty on imports from
Australia, India and China.''

   When it comes to clothing, it turns out that
single men buy more than single women.
   But they're buying a lot of it for the women, not themselves,
researchers have found.
   Men also spend more than women on eating out, entertainment,
alcoholic beverages, tobacco and cars.
   Single women, on the other hand, spend more of their income on
housing, food eaten at home, health care and reading material.
   Those are among the findings reported in the April edition of
American Demographics magazine.
   While the study of spending by single people reported that the
males spend more on clothing _ on average _ the difference rests
entirely with men aged 55 to 64.
   ``Men aged 55 to 64 spent $1,128 a year on apparel and services
in 1984-85, compared with the $682 a year spent by the women in
that group,'' reported Stephanie Shipp.
   ``Much of that difference can be accounted for by men's
purchasing of apparel as gifts. Almost 25 percent of the apparel
budget of men goes toward gifts, compared with 14 percent of the
apparel budget of women,'' she wrote.
   ``More than half of the men's apparel gift purchases are for
jewelry and watches _ and women are the likely recipients of many
of those gifts,'' reported Shipp.
   Women outspent men on apparel in all other age groups, but the
one deviation was enough to pull average clothing spending for all
single men above that of single women, $735 to $657, she found.
   Shipp heads the analysis branch of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' division of consumer expenditure surveys. Her report is
based on a study of spending by singles in 1984 and 1985. American
Demographics, published by Dow Jones & Company, concentrates on
population and marketing.
   While women have made gains in recent years they continue to
trail men in income at all age groups, Shipp noted.
   Thus, while women may spend less than men on some items, that
money may still represent a larger share of their resources than
for males.
   Single men are more likely to be younger, under age 35, while
single women were more often aged 55 and over, she found.
   Single women were more likely to own their own home, 41 percent,
compared to 29 percent of men, likely reflecting their older age as
a group.
   Single men were found to devote 20 percent of their money to
cars, car repairs and other transportation costs, while women spent
17 percent of their income on transport.
   After age 55, however, women tended to spend slightly more than
men on new cars and trucks, Shipp discovered.
   Single women spent twice as much as men on health care, and that
was not just because they tended to be older. Younger women also
spend more on health than men in their age group.
   At every age group men outspent women on entertainment,
``perhaps because it is still the custom that men pay for dates,''
Shipp said.

<HEAD>Finance Ministers from 151 Nations Meeting in US</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a change, there's no aura of crisis
hanging over this week's meetings of finance officials from 151
nations, a welcome development given the doomsday scenarios which
sprang up following the stock market collapse last October.
   The delegates to the spring meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank will be wrestling with the
long-standing problems of Third World debt and huge trade
imbalances as preliminary discussions get underway today in
Washington.
   But six months ago, many economists were predicting that the
finance leaders would be facing the far more troubling prospect of
a global recession, triggered by the stock market plunge.
   Instead, the world economy is growing at a faster rate than
expected, inflation is remaining subdued and the stock markets in
the United States and other countries have regained much of the
ground lost last fall.
   For this reason, analysts aren't expecting any major policy
changes to come out of the meeting Wednesday between Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III and his counterparts from Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   Baker, the mastermind behind some of the Reagan administration's
most successful economic initiatives, is likely to urge a
don't-rock-the-boat approach that will keep things on an even keel
through the November presidential election.
   In a speech last week, Baker boasted that ``significant
progress'' had been made by the United States and its allies in
promoting economic cooperation.
   ``The seven largest industrial nations in the free world now
have a coordination process firmly in place,'' he said.
   This will be the first meeting of the so-called Group of Seven
since last September. At that time, unity and international
economic cooperation were also the watchwords.
   But behind-the-scenes disagreements between the United States
and West Germany over interest rates became public soon after the
meeting, unnerving investors and, many believe, contributing to the
Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   The market collapse served as a strong reminder to finance
leaders of the dangers in disharmony and on Dec. 22 they pledged to
support the dollar at its current levels. They then backed that
pledge up by intervening in currency markets, the process by which
governments buy and sell currencies to influence their value.
   Since early this year, the dollar has stabilized and the top
industrial countries are expected to pledge anew this week to
support that stability.
   Baker is also likely to push again for the other countries to
adopt his idea of using an index of commodity prices, including
gold, as one of indicators the countries use to measure the impact
of their policies.
   But some have been skeptical, wondering if the proposal might be
the first step to moving the world back to a gold standard for
currencies, something that was abandoned in 1973 when the current
floating exchange rates were implemented.
   Baker denies that, saying the commodity index would merely serve
as a useful measure of inflationary pressures.
   On Third World debt, the finance ministers are expected to
basically reaffirm existing strategies although they may adopt some
new approaches aimed at cutting the trillion-dollar debt burden.
   Barber Conable, president of the World Bank, has taken the
position that the burden on heavily indebted countries is becoming
unsustainable and such initiatives as the recent Mexican
debt-for-bonds swap are needed if the debt crisis is ever to be
resolved. In that case, Mexico offered to exchange debt held by
commerical banks in return for a reduced amount of Mexican bonds
which were backed by U.S. Treasury securities.
   For his part, Baker has also endorsed efforts to find new ways
of reducing the debt burden but he has opposed any broad
debt-relief plans involving the World Bank or the IMF, contending
they would be too costly and would represent a bailout for big
commercial banks.

   The ``American Focus'' radio show and the

guests heard on the program usually are.
   Jimmy Carter, Henry Fonda, Jerry Falwell, Joan Rivers, Carl
Sagan, David Letterman, Bob Hope, Walter Mondale, Julia Child,
David Rockefeller, Abba Eban, Dan Rather and Norman Mailer are
among the hundreds of luminaries who have agreed to sit behind the
mike.
   The show, one of the country's largest nationally syndicated
public affairs radio programs, is the work of 30 Princeton
University students who have virtually no formal radio training and
put the show together in their spare time.
   Even radio professionals are surprised when they learn the show
is just a student activity.
   ``It's very professionally done. I didn't know they were
students. They sounded like they have been in the field for quite
some time,'' said Sean Cort, public affairs coordinator for WRKS-FM
in New York City, which broadcasts the program.
   The weekly, half-hour show features one guest and three to four
student interviewers. It boasts a network of 270 stations,
including outlets in all of the nation's 50 largest radio markets.
   For the most part the show is broadcast either Sunday morning or
night, the time slots to which most public affairs programs are
relegated.
   The show is geared to adults, not college students. The program
is not even heard on college radio stations.
   ``For the most part our audience is not our peers. It's
primarily adults,'' said Richard Fitzgerald, a junior who's
executive producer.
   ``Rock stars ... we just don't think that's what our audience
will appreciate. When we do entertainers we go for the more
established entertainers.''
   Because a show may not be broadcast until three weeks after
taping, ``American Focus'' doesn't try to break news.
   It focuses on the guest's view of the news and ``a little bit
about the person, their lives and things that have led them into
what they are doing,'' said the show's current president, junior
Sofia Perez.
   But the show has made some headlines. Several years ago, actor
Richard Dreyfuss admitted while on ``American Focus'' that he had
used drugs. Dreyfuss also said he stopped using them after he was
charged with possessing narcotics following a traffic accident.
   A blown-up copy of a Los Angeles Times story crediting
``American Focus'' with the scoop hangs in the show's offices in a
creeky old house on the Princeton campus.
   ``Sometimes, the guests, if they know we are college students,
they won't put up as much as a front than if we were
professionals,'' Fitzpatrick said.
   The show was founded in 1974 by a local high school student who
pieced the initial programs together ``with scotch tape and
stuff,'' Fitzpatrick said.
   The first show, with a relatively anonymous New Jersey official
as the guest, could only be heard on a Trenton radio station. When
the student, Garth Ancier, now an executive at Fox Broadcasting,
was accepted to Princeton, he bought the show with him, initially
producing it out of his dormitory room.
   Today the show still doesn't receive direct financial support
from the university, but it now has commercial sponsors who help
pay its annual budget of $40,000 to $50,000. Money left over is put
back into the program because the enterprise is non-profit.

<HEAD>McGovern: Dukakis' Win In Wisconsin Should Wrap Up Nomination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUKESHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential candidate George
McGovern says Michael Dukakis' win in the Wisconsin primary last
week will probably assure his receiving the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   McGovern, who lost to former President Richard M. Nixon in 1972,
said Dukakis' win over Jesse Jackson in the Wisconsin primary ``was
a turning point.''
   ``Dukakis came out of Wisconsin with a head of steam,'' the
former South Dakota senator said.
   McGovern talked about the current political campaign Saturday in
an interview before he addressed a conference on the Vietnam War.
   Dukakis finished with 48 percent of the popular vote in the
Wisconsin primary Tuesday, compared to Jackson with 28 percent and
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore with 17 percent.
   McGovern, 65, said he has not endorsed any candidate and
believes the nomination should go to the Democrat who enters the
national convention in July with the most delegates.

<HEAD>Time: Bush has ``No Grudges'' Against Rather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says he has ``no
grudges'' against anchorman Dan Rather, with whom he verbally
sparred during a nationally televised interview, but he's passed up
lunch with columnist George Will because of ``personal attacks,''
according to Time Magazine.
   Bush, discussing his relationship with the media, told the
magazine in its current issue: ``I have nothing against Dan Rather.
He was nice to my kids. I called him up and said, `I've been
looking for an excuse to call you and say no grudges.'
   ``The same with many others who have criticized me. They are
coming from one place, I am coming from another. I understand
that,'' he said in the interview published Sunday.
   The nine-minute live exchange between Bush and Rather on the
``CBS Evening News'' on Jan. 25, spurred angry phone calls to CBS
affiliates across the country, as well as headlines and political
analysis of the fallout.
   Bush, however, doesn't get along with Will, according to Time.
   ``I draw the line at personal attacks,'' the vice president said.
   Will called him a ``lap dog'' and then asked him to lunch but
Bush said he passed on the invitation.

<HEAD>Tuesday Caucuses Mark First Step in Missouri Delegate Selection
Process</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican and Democratic officials
alike expect Tuesday's caucuses in which both parties begin their
delegate selection process to be relatively quiet events that offer
no surprises.
   Tuesday night, party regulars are scheduled to attend Democratic
and Republican meetings to pick individuals to proceed to future
gatherings where delegates to the parties' national conventions in
Atlanta and New Orleans will be selected.
   Because Missouri had a presidential primary, the number of
delegates each presidential candidate will receive already has been
determined. So Tuesday night's caucuses will really be a matter of
just picking the individuals to represent the candidates.
   ``There's no reason to try to raid the caucuses,'' said Lt. Gov.
Harriett Woods, the Democrats' top elected official in Missouri.
   ``Everybody seems to be magnanimous,'' said Tony Feather,
executive director of the Missouri Republican Party. ``There's no
real animosity.''
   Tuesday night's mass meetings are the first of several steps
over the next two months that will determine which Missourians will
go to the conventions this summer where the two presidential
nominees will be picked.

   Six 24-foot fiberglass Oscars stood guard
today outside the Shrine Auditorium, flanked by dozens of fans
camped out in bleachers for a front-row look at celebrities
arriving for the 60th annual Academy Awards.
   ``This is my ninth year being first, and 11th overall. I'm
having a great time,'' bragged Joey Marcus, slurping on a frozen
ice bar as temperatures soared to 93 degrees Sunday afternoon.
   With about 100 fans already grabbing seats outside Sunday to
catch a glimpse at the glitz, inside, technicians fine-tuned
reluctant dragons and participants rehearsed.
   Tonight's three-hour show is to be broadcast nationally by
ABC-TV starting at 9 p.m. EDT.
   Bernardo Bertolucci's ``The Last Emperor,'' the kind of
historical epic Hollywood loves to embrace, was favored for best
picture over ``Broadcast News,'' ``Moonstruck,'' ``Fatal
Attraction'' and ``Hope and Glory.''
   Cher, Holly Hunter, Glenn Close, Sally Kirkland and Meryl Streep
were in contention for best actress. Michael Douglas and Robin
Williams were in a best actor battle with Marcello Mastroianni,
Jack Nicholson and William Hurt.
   During rehearsals Saturday, Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli
worked their way through an introductory duet introducing a medley
of Oscar-nominated best songs, with Moore playing a white concert
grand piano.
   The first song, ``Storybook Love,'' got under way with a
silhouette sequence featuring a prince who was supposed to take on
enemies and slay a dragon as they slipped past him on a treadmill.
   But as Willy DeVille moved through his tune, the dancer-prince
stood with nothing approaching. A disembodied stage manager's voice
shouted, ``OK, we have an emergency stop. Please stop. ... Our
dragon hung up.''
   ``Of course it has hang-ups. That's why they call it a
drag-on,'' quipped DeVille.
   Dragon fixed, the sequence continued with a female dancer on guy
wires gracefully descending to the arms of her waiting prince until
she bumped into a passing castle.
   The auditorium, which features distinctive twin turnip-top domes
and filigreed cornices and arches, seats 6,308, twice as many as
the Los Angeles Music Center, which had been the Oscars' home for
years.
   Red carpeting lined the entrance where Oscar nominees, studio
chiefs and others will file through tonight.
   Fans began arriving before dawn on Sunday, bringing ice chests,
sleeping bags, plenty of cold drinks and hats.
   Southern California residents Ray Hernandez and his wife, Tina,
grabbed a corner spot of the bleachers.
   The Hernandezes and their niece found seating after officials
turned them away Friday and Saturday because the bleachers were
unfinished.
   ``They said come back at 7 p.m. on Sunday, but we came early on
a hunch and they (would) let us in,'' Hernandez said.
   In all, winners of 22 awards were to be announced tonight. Three
already were announced, the Irving G. Thalberg lifetime achievement
award for director Billy Wilder.
   In the actress category, Cher was nominated for her
``Moonstruck'' role, Hunter for ``Broadcast News,'' Close for
``Fatal Attraction,'' Kirkland for ``Anna'' and Streep for
``Ironweed.''
   In the actor category, Douglas was nominated for his ``Wall
Street'' role, Williams for ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' Mastroianni
for ``Dark Eyes,'' Nicholson for ``Ironweed'' and Hurt for
``Broadcast News.''
   The supporting performance categories include Norma Aleandro for
``Gaby,'' Anne Archer for ``Fatal Attraction,'' Olympia Dukakis for
``Moonstruck,'' Anne Ramsey for ``Throw Momma from the Train,'' and
Ann Sothern for ``The Whales of August.''
   For supporting actor: Albert Brooks for ``Broadcast News,'' Sean
Connery for ``The Untouchables,'' Morgan Freeman for ``Street
Smart,'' Vincent Gardenia for ``Moonstruck'' and Denzel Washington
for ``Cry Freedom.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Zaccaro Drug Case Was More Than Possession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANICA KIRKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor says he refused to reduce a
felony charge against John Zaccaro Jr. because ``there was plenty
of evidence'' that the son of former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro was selling cocaine.
   Ferraro said she and her candidacy were partly to blame for her
son's conviction Saturday, but blasted Addison County State's
Attorney John Quinn for failing to accept a plea bargain.
   Quinn said he was reluctant because of the problem of drugs in
society.
   ``I recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37
marijuana plants. Perhaps in some counties they might have reduced
that. But as time goes on I feel more strongly about drug cases,''
Quinn said Sunday. ``I just think it's becoming more of a problem
in the country and we need to deter that.''
   Zaccaro, 24, was convicted of selling one-quarter gram of
cocaine to an undercover officer at his off-campus apartment on
Feb. 20, 1986. He was a senior at Middlebury College at the time.
   No sentencing date has been set. The felony conviction carries a
maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $10,000 fine.
   At a news conference after the verdict, Ferraro said the family
would appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court.
   ``We still believe he was set up,'' she said.
   Ferraro blamed her son for possession of cocaine, as well as
herself ``and my candidacy for making my son a target.'' She was
the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984.
   But she said Quinn prolonged ``the agony for two years'' by not
allowing Zaccaro to plead to a lesser count of cocaine possession.
   ``We, as his parents, would not allow him to plead guilty'' to
the felony charge of selling cocaine, Ferraro said.
   ``To me it was clearly a selling case,'' said Quinn, who said
the family first approached him about a pea agreement at Zaccaro's
arraignment. ``There was plenty of evidence he was selling. I never
considered a possession case and they know that.''
   He added, ``If she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the
charge, that's her prerogative. I didn't feel there was any
justification for reducing the charge.''
   Zaccaro's defense lawyer, Charles Tetzlaff, had argued that his
client was entrapped by a young, inexperienced, attractive female
undercover police officer.
   ``This is a case of improper and overzealous police conduct,''
he told jurors.
   But Quinn called Zaccaro a well-organized drug dealer, and said
he was known on campus as ``The Pharmacist'' because of his
reputation as a dealer.
   After Zaccaro's arrest, Middlebury College officials formed a
task force to look at the campus drug problem. After more than a
dozen meetings, it made 20 recommendations, most of which were
implemented by college trustees.
   They included the hiring of a health educator, publication of a
drug brochure, additional security staff, and improved relations
with the Middlebury police.
   Most Middlebury students questioned about the case said the
outcome did not concern them. ``My sophomore year it was more
interesting. But now, half the people on campus weren't even
here,'' said Bob Woithe, a senior from Palm Island, Fla.

   Jewish settlers rejected an army report saying
an Israeli teen-ager was killed by a settler's gun and demanded
harsh punishment for a West Bank village where they claim the girl
was slain by Arabs.
   In another development, Palestinian leaders on Sunday called for
a commercial strike today in the occupied lands and demanded the
resignation of Arabs holding appointed or elected positions in the
territories.
   The occupied territories were quiet on Sunday. Arab reports said
troops closed shops and food markets in Gaza Strip, which opened
during morning hours.
   Since Palestinians began violent protests against Israeli rule
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in early December, 141
Arabs, one Israeli soldier and one Israeli civilian have been
killed.
   The Jewish settlers and right-wing legislators, including some
from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, on Sunday
condemned the army after its report on the death of the teen-ager
and demanded its chief of staff resign.
   They urged tough sanctions on Palestinian rioters, including the
expulsion of Arab stone-throwers, and called for the destruction of
every home in Beita, the West Bank village where 15-year-old Tirza
Porat was killed on Wednesday.
   Israel Television quoted the army report as saying Miss Porat
was accidentally killed by the M-16 rifle of Roman Al Dubi, a
settler-guard who ``panicked and opened fire in all directions''
during the clash with Arab rioters. Besides Miss Porat, two Arabs
died in the melee, and 15 people, including 13 Jewish teen-agers
and two Arabs, were wounded.
   Outraged settlers insisted Miss Porat was shot with a rifle by a
masked Arab and charged the Jewish teen-agers involved were not
properly questioned.
   The army said it has destroyed 13 houses belonging to inciters
of last week's clash and killed a 14-year-old Arab who tried to
avoid arrest. Israel's Supreme Court has barred the army from
destroying any more homes in Beita pending an appeal from a civil
rights group.
   The daily Maariv reported on Sunday that 150 villagers have been
detained, of whom 30 remained in custody.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the army chief of staff, Lt.
Gen. Dan Shomron, presented the army's version of the clash to the
Cabinet on Sunday.
   Rabin said an army autopsy showed Miss Porat apparently was shot
by a bullet from Al Dubi's rifle, Israel radio reported. Al Dubi
and another adult settler were guarding the Jewish teen-agers
during a hike.
   A senior army official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the fatal bullet came from Al Dubi's weapon, but said the
army had not yet determined who fired the shot. The hikers said Al
Dubi only fired a single shot in the air while the group was inside
Beita.
   ``I looked up and saw an Arab man with a masked face shooting a
(rifle) from a rooftop,'' said Ariel Avivi, a hiker.
   Geulah Cohen, a legislator from the nationalistic Tehiya Party,
demanded that Shomron resign. ``I think he simply failed. He jumped
to conclusions and, acting as a judge, pointed an accusing finger
at the settlers,'' she said on Israel Television on Sunday.
   The TV quoted Likud's trade and industry minister, Ariel Sharon,
as telling the Cabinet that Arabs who attacked the youths should be
expelled, their homes destroyed and a new Jewish settlement
established nearby.
   Shamir's political rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the
Labor Party, defended the army. ``Cabinet ministers are not
investigators and the Cabinet is not a judge. This should be left
to competent authorities,'' Peres said.
   Shamir called for ``unity between all parts of the people ...
for the good of the people and, first of all, for the security of
the people.''
   A Palestinian leaflet distributed on Sunday in the occupied
lands praised Beita residents for ``responding twice as strongly to
wild settlers'' and called on Palestinians to make donations to
Beita on Wednesday.
   The leaflets repeated earlier calls for the resignation of Arab
officials in occupied territories and demanded that Palestinians
stop working in Jewish settlements. Another leaflet called for a
general strike today.

   Beijing plans to host its first beauty pageant
since the Communist takeover, the official China Daily said today.
   Long Xinmin, head of the Beijing Television Studio co-sponsoring
the event, said 10 Beijing ``girls of youth and elegance'' will be
selected through a television contest and awarded ``youth vitality
prizes,'' the report said.
   He said judges will put ``as much emphasis on the participants'
knowledge, performing technique, and moral character as on their
appearance and dress.'' The contest is open to women, married and
unmarried, who are residents of Beijing and between the ages of 17
and 27.
   The contest will end in June, and the finals will be televised.
   The first beauty contest in China since the takeover occurred in
Canton in 1985. The government was sensitive about it at the time
because the Communist Party says concern for physical appearance is
decadent and vain.

   Four prominent intellectuals were
expelled from the Communist Party, apparently because they were
associated with the ``Democratic Forum,'' a loose group of mostly
non-conformist intellectuals, artists and professionals calling for
political change.
   The weekend edition of the party daily Nepszabadsag identified
the four as Zoltan Kiraly, a television journalist and member of
parliament; Zoltan Biro, senior staff member of the National
Library; Mihaly Bihari, a professor at the faculty of political and
legal science of Eotvoes Lorand University; and Laszlo Lengyel,
senior scientific staff member of a financial research institute.
   Nepszabadsag said the party's Central Control Commission
established that the four ``represented views on several
fundamental questions different from those upheld by party policy.''
   They were found guilty of ``voicing and spreading these views
for a prolonged time at different forums outside the party.''
   The ``Democratic Forum'' was set up at a meeting of 150
intellectuals at Lakitelek in southern Hungary on Sept. 27, 1987.

   Military leaders have fined officers a total of $4
million in a new drive to end corruption and abuses of power that
are damaging Soviet military readiness, Pravda reported.
   The official Communist Party newspaper on Sunday quoted chief
military prosecutor Boris S. Popov as saying officials were trying
to stamp out evasion of military service, theft, damage of military
equipment and other crimes.
   Pravda said the military had not been exempt from the stagnation
and corruption that Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to stamp out of
Soviet society.
   Violations of laws and military regulations had become habitual
among some commanding officers and political officers, he said. The
fines were levied in the past two months against an unspecified
number of soldiers, Popov said.
   Some soldiers were found to be renting private apartments and
living outside barracks and stealing or damaging military property,
Pravda said. Soldiers who busy themselves with outside economic
activities have caused a ``great damage'' to Soviet military
preparedness, Pravda said.

   Pop star Michael Jackson opened his estate to
bidders who purchased artwork and helped the reclusive singer raise
more than $2 million to benefit the South African Council of
Churches.
   Jackson was away on tour, but his brother Jermaine and family
patriarch Joseph Jackson were hosts of Sunday's auction. Actress
Whoopi Goldberg was auctioneer.
   In addition to the sale of a $1.2 million pearl to a buyer whose
name wasn't revealed, other jewelry, paintings, sculptures and furs
were sold, said auction spokeswoman Sabrina Horn.
   Miss Goldberg bought an oil painting by Grant Wood valued at
between $300,000 to $500,000, said Ms. Horn, who wouldn't disclose
how much the actress paid.
   It wasn't immediately known how much was raised by the auction,
but Ms. Horn said, ``It would be safe to say that millions of
dollars were raised.''
   More than 110 items were auctioned.
   Up to 300 people were treated to cocktails as a band and
magician entertained. Guests were allowed to tour the property,
while bidders bought artwork, including a Pablo Picasso oil
painting dated Feb. 27, 1969, and titled ``Buste d'Homme.''
   The dining room was the only portion of the home open to the
bidders, reporters and photographers.
   Lia Belli, head of the Adelphia Society and wife of attorney
Melvin Belli, arranged the auction with permission from Joseph
Jackson, Ms. Horn said.
   The money will go toward emergency housing, clothing and medical
supplies for displaced South African families.

   Average retail gasoline prices jumped more
than a penny-a-gallon during the past two weeks nationwide and
motorists can expect the increases to continue, an analyst said.
   The 1.18 cent-a-gallon increase for all grades of gasoline
pushed the average price to 96.14 cents in the period ended April
8, according to the Lundberg Survey.
   Wholesale prices increased at twice the retail rate, analyst
Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
   ``This means retailers lost a penny of their operating margin
during the period and it means that there is more price pressure to
come in the immediate future,'' she said.
   According to the survey, prices per gallon at self-service pumps
were: regular unleaded, 86.80 cents; premium unleaded, $101.84;
regular leaded, 83.97 cents.
   Prices at full-service pumps were: regular unleaded, $116.93;
premium unleaded, $127.20; regular leaded, $112.51.

<HEAD>Congress May Postpone Asbestos Removal From Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education officials are urging Congress to
give them more time to rid the nation's public and private schools
of cancer-causing asbestos.
   The officials say there is insufficient money and trained
manpower to meet this October's asbestos-inspection deadline, set
in 1986 by a Congress upset with the slow pace of the battle
against the deadly substance.
   But groups representing teachers, parents and school employees
are opposing a deadline extension, arguing that such a step is
unwarranted and would prolong long-term health threats faced by
millions of schoolchildren.
   ``Many local public school districts are incapable of
compliance,'' a hearing by two Senate Environment subcommittees was
told recently by Robert Anderson, representing the National School
Boards Association.
   ``By extending the deadlines, Congress will be sending a message
to school districts that it is acceptable to continue to ignore or
delay action on this serious health issue,'' says Ann Lynch, first
vice president of the National PTA.
   Once a common building material, asbestos is dangerous when it
becomes friable, or crumbly. Friable asbestos releases the fibers
that can cause a variety of respiratory ailments, including lung
cancer. The fibers pose more threat to a child's lungs than to an
adult's.

scrambling to decide what they should do, a competitor says.
   Only one of six other companies in the field in the United
States, Pennwalt Corp. is following Du Pont so far in its March 25
announcement that it believes that chlorofluorocarbon compounds,
CFCs, and related compounds should be phased out soon.
   The conclusions of DuPont and Pennwalt were prompted by a March
15 report from a scientific panel organized by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration that CFCs appear to have
caused an average 2.3 percent decline in the earth's protective
ozone layer at northern mid-latitudes between 1969 and 1986.
   At the other end of the spectrum is Great Lakes Chemical Corp.,
which, says spokesman Gregory J. Griffiths, believes there is no
reason to go beyond the international agreement endorsed by 31
nations in Montreal last fall.
   So far ratified only by the United States and Mexico, the treaty
calls for a 50 percent cut in CFC production by 1998 and a freeze
on halons in 1992.
   CFCs are used in the United States for refrigeration fluids,
cleaning solvents in electronics manufacture and foam blowing
agents. Overseas CFCs are also used as aerosol propellants.

   A man upset over a failed relationship
fatally shot his former girlfriend and her boyfriend before killing
himself by shooting himself while fleeing in his car with police
chasing, authorities said.
   George Tachias, 24, apparently shot Tina Bates and 30-year-old
Rudy Jasso early Sunday when Ms. Bates told Tachias she didn't want
to see him anymore, said police spokeswoman Mary Molina Mescall.
   Tachias placed the body of the 24-year-old Ms. Bates in his car
and led police on a chase through southwest Albuquerque. He then
shot himself in the chest and drove the car into a pole, Ms.
Mescall said.
   Tachias was pronounced dead a short time later at the University
of New Mexico Hospital.

   Afghan guerrillas downed a
Soviet-built passenger plane near the Soviet border, killing all 29
people aboard, Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul reported.
   There was no immediate comment from the guerrillas.
   The report said the Antonov-26 passenger plane was shot down by
a missile at 3:10 p.m. Sunday (6:40 a.m EDT) while flying between
Maimaneh, in Afghanistan's northwestern Faryab province, and Mazar
Sharif, in the Balkh province. The cities are about 145 miles apart.
   The plane carried six crew members and 23 passengers, including
two children, according to the report, monitored in Islamabad.
   It did not say whether the plane was a Soviet transport or a
civilian airliner of the domestic Bakhtar airline. Both fly the
Antonov-26.
   The Afghan airline also has been known to carry commercial
passengers in planes with military markings.
   The reported crash came three days after the United Nations
announced an agreement to end the war between Moslem guerrillas and
Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government and clear the way for the
removal of Soviet troops.
   Radio Kabul, quoting Afghanistan's official Bakhtar News Agency,
said the guerrillas attacked with anti-aircraft rockets.
   ``Once more, extremist opposition elements carried out a
terrorist action,'' the radio said. ``As a result of this savage
action by extremist elements, 23 passengers and six crew were
martyred.''
   Afghan President Najib expressed sorrow and sympathy to the
families of ``those who have been sacrificed to this criminal
action,'' the report added.
   Despite the proposal to withdraw Soviet troops, the Afghan
guerrillas have said they will continue to fight Najib's government
until it is deposed. The civil war began 10 years ago when a
communist coup brought to power a government friendly to the Soviet
Union.
   On Sept. 13, 1987, Afghan guerrillas shot down an Antonov-26
near the northern city of Kunduz. Reports said 14 to 17 people were
killed.
   The rebels are armed with U.S.-made Stinger and British Blowpipe
anti-aircraft missiles.
   The radio did not identify the type of rocket used in Sunday's
shooting.
   The rebels acquired the Stingers in late 1986. They reportedly
have shot down an average of one Soviet or Afghan aircraft a day
since they received the heat-seeking Stinger and the radar-guided
Blowpipe missiles.
   According to unofficial reports, about 200 people were killed
last year alone while flying in the Afghan military planes.
   The communists seized power in a bloody April 1978 coup. Soviet
troops entered the country in December 1979 to help the faltering
government against the Moslem insurgents. An estimated 115,000
Soviet troops remain.

   Stock market's key indicator surged to an all-time
high closing Monday in Tokyo, while the U.S. dollar gained ground
in trading against the Japanese yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed a modest 20.33 points Friday, gained 175.98
points, or 0.65 percent, finishing the day at 26,924.87.
   The dollar closed at 125.71 yen, up 0.53 yen from its close of
125.18 yen Friday. It had opened the day at 125.80 yen, and traded
between 125.68-125.83 yen.
   ``People are buying on an optimism based chiefly on the dollar's
movement,'' said Julian Jones, a broker at Vickers da Costa.
   He attributed the U.S. currency's positive trend to Wednesday's
anticipated meeting of monetary officials of the Group of Seven
major economic countries and Thursday's announcement of U.S. trade
figures for February.
   The bullish movement is expected to continue for the rest of the
day, Jones added.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said the
dollar's firmness also reflected last Friday's close in New York,
when the dollar closed the week at 125.75 yen.
   ``Otherwise, many market participants are taking a wait-and-see
position prior to an announcement of U.S. trade figures for
February,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   A one-hour visit planned this week by
Sweden's royal couple has unleashed a wave of monarch mania in
Bridgeton.
   Every lamppost in town has Swedish and American flags, a pizza
parlor printed special T-shirts for the occasion and inmates were
rushing to finish a Swedish farmstead museum in the middle of an
abandoned baseball field.
   ``It's going to be tremendous. Bridgeton hasn't had this much
excitement in a long time,'' said Reginald Scott, the owner of Big
John's Pizza.
   In honor of the royal visit, Scott printed up commemorative Big
John T-shirts for some of the 10,000 visitors expected to join King
Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia on Thursday.
   ``That's the closest we'll come to Swedish pizza,'' he said with
a laugh.
   The royal couple plan to start a day of touring in New Jersey in
Bridgeton, where they'll dedicate a log-cabin museum commemorating
the historic 1638 landing that led to the Swedish settlement of the
Delaware Valley.
   Bridgeton normally is not steeped in Scandinavian tradition but
the visit kicks off a four-day Swedish cultural tribute that
includes dancing, crafts and other events.
   The visit here is scheduled to last only 60 minutes and will
cost about $300,000 in public and private funds, city recreation
director Bob Rose said.
   But nobody seems to mind the short stop.
   ``It's more than that. It's a whole weekend but the visit is the
highlight,'' Rose said.

   A proposal to turn former federal prison
Alcatraz Island into a casino crapped out in a newspaper survey of
San Francisco residents.
   ``I hate to sound so Californian, but it's just not good
karma,'' said, one of those surveyed, Kathleen Kelly, 30. ``It is
just a dumb idea.''
   The proposal, an advisory measure on the June 7 ballot, was
opposed by a margin of 57 percent to 35 percent of the 600 people
participating in the poll by the San Francisco Chronicle, the
newspaper reported today.
   Supervisors who placed Proposition N on the ballot say a casino
could generate millions of dollars for the debt-plagued city.
Several hurdles would have to be cleared first _ the city would
have to acquire the land from the state, the state constitution
would have to be changed to allow casino gambling, and numerous
capital improvements would have to be made.
   Alcatraz, known as The Rock, now is a popular attraction for
tourists who want to take a peek at the former home of gangster Al
Capone and other incorrigibles.
   Putting a casino on Alcatraz ``would be like violating Mount
Rushmore or Ellis Island,'' said Saundra Neal, a legal secretary
who moved here from New York 18 months ago. ``I think it is very
beautiful. It's peaceful.''
   ``The idea of putting some kind of casino blight in the middle
of the bay is really repulsive,'' said Jerry Weiss. ``Flashing neon
just seems like a stupid idea for the bay.''

   Following is the text of the Islamic

from Arabic to English by The Associated Press:
   In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate,
   O sons of our Islamic nation,
   O free holy warriors in the world,
   Here is a group of holy warriors undertaking today with all
force and determination a serious attempt to free holy warriors who
sacrificed dearly and who are suffering torture in the prison
dungeons of the oppressive state of Kuwait.
   They have been jailed for confronting the centers of
international arrogance in our Islamic homeland along with regimes
that sold themselves cheaply to the superpowers and their interests
in the region.
   We declare today our full support to the rightful demands of the
hijackers and back them forcefully, and we warn that any
foolhardiness committed against the plane under any pretext or
cover in any form, the Cypriot authorities will bear the full
responsibility for what happens on its territory, which will bring
harm to its government and people.
   To the families of the hostages, we declare that we shall
execute the Western captives in Lebanon if the plane and holy
warriors aboard are subjected to any military foolhardiness.
   The Organization of Islamic Jihad.
   April 1988.

<BYLINE>By BETH GRACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheba isn't a typical 6-year-old just
because she likes candy, playing with the telephone and coloring.
   Sheba is a chimpanzee who knows how to count.
   The chimp, who lives at Ohio State University's animal
laboratory here, is one of only two monkeys in the world able to
count, and the only one that understands the concept of zero, said
Sally Boysen, director of the lab's primate cognition project.
   Boysen said last week she believes that ability is a major step
forward in defining the cognitive processes of higher primates and
their similarities to those of humans.
   Boysen, who said the ability to count objects involves a
different cognitive process than learning languages, was one of the
participants in early studies that showed higher primates can learn
language.
   More than a decade ago, Koko, a female gorilla, and Washoe, a
female chimp, learned to use sign language to communicate with
humans.
   But counting is a new research goal, and a hobby Sheba indulges
in when she is not playing with her keepers, with the four other
apes at the lab or with Boysen's dog Schuyler, who is her best
friend.
   The chimp also dials telephone numbers at random when no one is
watching.
   Sheba, a lab-born chimp owned by The Columbus Zoo, will appear
on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' this week and is the subject
of a People magazine story due out this month.
   The surrogate mother-daughter relationship between Boysen and
Sheba and their mutual teasing has helped the chimp ignore the
attention and get to work.
   In a recent demonstration, Sheba was placed on the floor in
front of a small, rectangular yellow plate. Above that was placed
plastic squares with numbers ranging from zero to seven, mixed
randomly. Boysen then placed four apples on the plate.
   ``OK, Sheba. We're going to count some apples. How many?''
Boysen asked. Sheba, fighting a desire to mug for a photographer,
touched each apple, then pointed to the number five and looked to
Boysen for approval.
   ``You know that is not five apples. Try to tell me how many,''
Boysen said. Sheba counted again and pointed to the number seven.
   It took another try and a hallway conference between Boysen and
Sheba before the ape finally ignored the photographer and picked
the correct number. Sheba was rewarded with a kiss and a handful of
M&Ms and gumdrops.
   Boysen has worked with Sheba for almost five years, and says the
association has been rewarding from the start, even though Sheba
would rather be playing.
   ``They have such a short attention span,'' Boysen said. ``At
first she wouldn't try at all. But then she began to show us she
could learn fast.''

<HEAD>Slayings Of 11 Women Remain Unsolved</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than three years after 11 young
women were killed in the Fort Worth area, only one of the crimes
has been solved, leads are down to a trickle and residents remain
fearful.
   The women, killed from September 1984 until May 1985, included
waitresses, schoolteachers, receptionists, a bartender, a student
and a homemaker. They died of stab wounds, gunshots and
strangulation. One is missing and presumed dead.
   ``It was on all our minds. It was the conversation everywhere.
Everyone was wishing that some of these women would be found,''
said Bernice Barker, 68, who lives across the street from the
garage apartment where one victim lived.
   A multi-agency group spent more than a year investigating the
deaths and, at one point, grew to more than 40 officers. By July
1985 the task force was reduced to 15 members. In mid-1986, Police
Chief Thomas Windham returned officers to their regular assignments.
   Detectives conducted more than 3,000 interviews and compiled a
list of 7,000 suspects, including friends, acquaintances and
relatives of victims. The investigation cost more than $1 million,
Windham said.
   The different slaying methods convinced police that more than
one killer was responsible, said Capt. Ben Dumas.
   Police today say they have suspects in three of the slayings but
lack the evidence needed to file charges. Investigators sometimes
spend time after work on the case in hopes of finding leads.
   Detective Curt Brannan says he often is led back to the spot
where Sarah Ann Kashka, 15, disappeared. He said he occasionally
returns on the same night of the week she vanished to piece
together where she headed after leaving a friend's apartment.
   ``When you go to a crime scene and see the things we do, and
talk to the family, you know the family is depending on you. It's
difficult to spend an eight-hour shift working on the case, put it
down and go home,'' Brannan said.
   Miss Kashka disappeared Dec. 30, 1984, after spending the
evening with friends. She was found stabbed to death two days later
near Mountain Creek Lake in southwest Dallas County.
   The slaying of Lisa Griffin was the only one solved. In October
1985, Michael Wayne Goodin of Fort Worth was convicted of her
murder and was sentenced to 43 years in prison.
   The reams of neatly packed information investigators collected
provides little comfort to families, homicide Sgt. Paul Kratz said.
   ``You're talking to them several times a day,'' Kratz said.
``You finally get to the point there's nothing new to tell them.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Guardian Angels picketed film director
Dennis Hopper's home to protest his new movie ``Colors,'' which the
anti-crime group called a recruitment film for gangs nationwide.
   ``It starts with a drive-by killing and ends with the killing of
an L.A. cop. I don't think that's the kind of message that needs to
get out in this country,'' Guardian Angels leader Curtis Sliwa said
Sunday.
   The self-styled crime fighters, who picketed actor Sean Penn's
home in Malibu on Saturday, set up symbolic coffins outside
Hopper's Venice home and chanted ``Kids will die with pain; Dennis
Hopper in the hall of shame.''
   The movie, which stars Penn and Robert Duvall as police
officers, is a drama set amid the gang wars of Los Angeles. Hopper
wrote and directed ``Colors.''
   Police reported no problems during the weekend demonstration,
which also included protesters lying on the ground to simulate a
murder scene.
   The Guardian Angels want Orion Pictures to either halt
distribution of the film or use some of its profits to support
community organizations that combat gang violence, said Sliwa.
   It wasn't known if Hopper was home during the protest. Sliwa
said some people were seen entering the house.
   Neither Hopper, nor Orion officials could be reached for comment
Sunday about the protest by telephone. Hopper has said previously
he was surprised by objections to the movie.
   Gangs were blamed for nearly 400 killings last year in Los
Angeles County, and were the target of two unprecedented citywide
police sweeps this weekend.

<HEAD>Man Arrested in NYC On Maryland Murder Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man sought for killing five people in Maryland
and one here is the sixth person to be arrested as a result of a TV
program about the country's most wanted fugitives, according to
police and the producers.
   Carl Dunstrom, 28, was seized after about 30 officers armed with
shotguns and carbines surrounded a three-story building in the
Brooklyn section.
   He was arrested in the building's basement after a brief
struggle on warrants issued in Prince George's County, Md.
   He was carrying a loaded .45-caliber handgun, and ballistics
tests will be done to determine whether it was the murder weapon in
the drug-related killings, homicide Capt. Robert Kinkaid said
Sunday.
   The only shot fired during Saturday night's raid came from an
officers' carbine, but no one was hit. So many officers
participated in the raid because Dunstrom was considered dangerous,
authorities said.
   The raid followed a three-week manhunt that began on a tip from
a viewer of the television program, ``America's Most Wanted,''
authorities said.
   Dunstrom was wanted in five killings in the Washington, D.C.,
suburb of Landover, in January and one in Brooklyn in November,
said Kinkaid.
   Police are still seeking Steve McMillian, 24, Kirk Bruce, 25,
and an unidentified suspect in the Jan. 22 slayings in Maryland of
four men and a woman. Police said the two are members of Jamaican
drug organizations.
   The Maryland victims, who police said had been involved in drug
trafficking organizations since the early 1980s, were shot in the
head and chest with semi-automatic weapons while in an apartment.
   One woman shot in the neck survived the attack.
   The Brooklyn victim _ Patrick Ford, 17, thought to be a cousin
of the suspect _ was found shot once in the head on Nov. 26.
   ``We don't know the reason for the shooting. He (Dunstrom) is
claiming it was an accident,'' said Kinkaid.
   Dunstrom was featured in a March 13 episode of the half-hour
weekly series in which actors re-create real crimes and viewers are
shown photographs and given information on fugitives and asked to
provide tips. They are promised confidentiality and sometimes
rewards.
   The program has been on the air only 10 weeks, and shown on
seven stations of the fledgling Fox Television Network. But because
of praise from authorities, it was moved to a prime-time slot and
starting Sunday will be broadcast on all of the network's 118
affiliated stations.
   Thomas R. Herwitz, Fox's vice president in charge of corporate
and legal affairs, said that of the 30 fugitives featured so far,
Dunstrom was the sixth to be arrested. Five were seized as a result
of viewers' tips and one surrendered, he said.
   Detective Howard E. Shook, who is leading the Prince George's
investigation, said last week the show generated nearly 100 tips in
the case.

   An army of officers arrested 1,300 people in
an unprecedented show of force against gang violence, but an
official said drug-dealing gangs still rule the streets in parts of
the nation's second-largest city.
   A 15-year-old boy was killed in a gang-related shooting Saturday
night as the two-day police operation dubbed ``Fly the Flag'' wound
down. Two others were killed in drive-by shootings, but there were
no known gang connections.
   Nine people were wounded Sunday night in a gang-related shooting
in Willowbrook, south of downtown, said sheriff's Detective Javier
Clift. None were seriously injured.
   ``From what we understand, the kids were playing outside,'' he
said. ``None of these people are gang members, they're just
innocent bystanders.''
   Three gang members approached the residents outside a house and
one of the three sprayed the group with gunfire, Clift said.
   The violence that continued during the sweep by 1,000 officers
proves that gangs still have the run of the streets, City
Councilman Nate Holden said.
   ``It just goes to show you, gang members just don't care,''
Holden said.
   Police began the two-night sweep Friday night and arrested more
than 1,300 people, about half suspected gang members, on a variety
of felony and misdemeanor charges. Police Chief Daryl Gates even
made one collar. Police were unsure how many people remained in
custody early today.
   About half the special police force, formed by putting officers
on four hours of voluntary overtime after a full eight-hour shift,
went to augment regular patrols in the south-central area, where
gangs are most active. The rest of the officers spread out citywide.
   The sweep was the department's largest attack ever on gangs,
which specialize in the sale and distribution of rock cocaine.
Gangs are blamed for 205 killings in Los Angeles last year. Gang
killings in all of Los Angeles County reached 387 last year.
   During the operation, officers stopped anyone who appeared to be
a gang member by the way they were dressed and their alleged use of
gang hand signals.
   In nine previous sweeps, which were smaller than ``Fly the
Flag,'' police deployed 200 to 300 officers at a time only in
south-central Los Angeles. There were 1,413 arrests in earlier
sweeps _ 1,124 gang-related.
   The latest crackdown was lauded by Patricia Patrick, founder of
the fledgling Mothers Against Gangs in Communities.
   ``But the key is getting them off and keeping them off,'' she
said. ``Parents will have to help the police keep them off the
streets.''

<HEAD>Soviets Destroy First Six Missiles Under INF Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has exploded six SS-12 missiles
that were removed from Eastern Europe under a superpower treaty to
eliminate all land-based intermediate-range nuclear weapons, Radio
Moscow said today.
   The missiles were exploded at a test site in southern
Kazakhstan, a republic of Soviet Asia where they had been brought
by train from East Germany and Czechoslovakia on Feb. 25-March 13.
Nuclear material was removed before the missiles were exploded, the
official radio said.
   President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed an agreement in
Washington on Dec. 8 to eliminate the medium- and shorter-range
missiles, which have a range of 300 to 3,100 miles. The SS-12s have
a range of 560 miles.
   The treaty is awaiting ratification by the U.S. Senate and the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's nominal
parliament. Passage by both sides is considered a virtual certainty.
   ``The first six Soviet shorter-range missiles liable for
scrapping under the INF treaty with the United States have been
exploded at a test site in southern Kazakhstan,'' Radio Moscow said
in an English-language broadcast.
   The explosions took place near the city of Saryozek, 125 miles
north of the Kazakhstan capital of Alma Ata. Radio Moscow did not
say when the missiles were destroyed and gave no indication when
more missiles might be exploded.
   It said that under the terms of the treaty, the missiles,
launchers and all auxiliary equipment are to be destroyed.
   Krasnaya Zvezda, the Defense Ministry newspaper, said in an
article published on Sunday that local residents were worried about
possible environmental damage but that there was none.
   The paper said an area of two miles around the missiles was
considered a danger zone and that local people were warned far
ahead of the blast.
   It quoted Alimbek Seytbekov, who was at work at a factory on the
other side of a mountain about three miles from the blast, as
saying he heard the noise but noticed no other effect.
   ``It is necessary to note here that the process of eliminating
the missiles practically had no effect on the surroundings,''
Krasnaya Zvezda said. ``An analysis of the air conducted by
specialists showed no harmful substances.''
   It said crews were given special training to destroy the
missiles, and that dismantling of the guidance systems was an
especially dangerous job because of of the presence of explosive
rocket fuels.
   Fifty-four SS-12 missiles were stationed at four sites in East
Germany. Soviet officials said in February that there had been 39
missiles and 24 mobile rocket launchers deployed in Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Mercury Climbs in California, Plummets in the Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Freezing temperatures today hit Oklahoma and the Plains, while
California basked in an unseasonable heat wave.
   Freezing temperature warnings were posted this morning over
northern Oklahoma as the mercury dipped to the 30s across much of
the northern Plains.
   Meanwhile, northern California enjoyed sweltering springtime
weather over the weekend, but fire officials weren't smiling as the
mercury rose.
   While glorious hot weather filled parks and beaches, it also
fueled fears that California could face a drought and a second
straight summer of devastating fires.
   ``I've never seen it so dry,'' said Dan Kuhnert, one of about 60
firefighters who battled a small but out-of-control blaze in the
Stanislaus National Forest east of Modesto on Sunday.
   Sunday was the second day of record heat throughout northern
California. In Sacramento, downtown thermometers hit 93 degrees,
edging the previous 92-degree record for the date set in 1951.
Santa Rosa's high of 88 beat the 1936 high of 85 degrees.
   In San Francisco, the 91-degree temperature as the highest ever
for April 10 in the 113 years that records have been kept. The old
record, set in 1904, was 84 degrees.
   Today's temperatures were expected to be higher than ususal but
a little cooler than the weekend highs, especially near the coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 21
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 74 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for rain along the central New England
coast; rain and a few thunderstorms over the south from South
Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas across the Gulf of Mexico coast.
   Highs will be in the 40s and 50s from New England across the
Great Lakes and the upper two-thirds of the Mississippi Valley; low
80s across southern Florida; 90s over the desert southwest and
interior valleys of California; 80s over much of California and
southern Oregon; 60s and 70s over the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>`War of Cities' Resumes After Three-Day Lull</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said it fired two missiles into
Tehran and another into Isfahan today, and Iran said 16 civilians
were killed.
   The reported attacks broke a three-day lull in the ``war of the
cities.''
   The Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the missiles
were fired after a lull that allowed Iranians to vote in Friday's
parliamentary elections.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, which confirmed one strike
on each of the cities and reported the civilian deaths, also said a
mosque, a hospital and homes were damaged. IRNA also was monitored
in Cyprus.
   The Iranian news agency quoted an unidentified military
spokesman as saying Iran's forces would retaliate and ``raze to the
ground the dens of mischief in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq.''
   Today's reports described the 117th and 118th missile attack on
Tehran and the 17th on Isfahan since Iraq began launching the
long-range missiles into Iranian cities for the first time on Feb.
29.
   IRNA quoted an unidentified spokesman as saying Iraqi warplanes
raided an Iranian village near the border city of Marivan on
Sunday. The spokesman said the renewed Iraqi attacks were proof
that Iraq needed ``a good punishment.''
   Iraq and Iran have been at war since September 1980.

<TEXT>
   Pierre S. du Pont III, a retired Du Pont
Co. executive and father of the former presidential candidate and
Delaware governor, has died after a long illness. He was 77.
   Du Pont, who died Saturday, rose to vice president and executive
committee member of the chemical company his family started. He
left it in 1965 to travel and later helped the political campaigns
of his son, Pierre S. du Pont IV.
   A chemical engineer by training, the elder du Pont bucked his
father to switch from the technical end of the chemical business to
marketing.
   His investments led to financial ups and downs, although he
consistently made Forbes magazine's list of the 400 richest
Americans in recent years. Forbes in 1987 said he was the 296th
richest American, worth $300 million.
   The elder du Pont entered a Pennsylvania hospital last year
before his son embarked on a campaign for the presidential
nomination. But the hospitalization was a closely guarded secret,
according to a family friend.
   His wife, Jane Holcomb du Pont, died in 1985.
   Besides his son, he is survived by two daughters, Jane du Pont
Kidd, of Dallas; Michele du Pont Goss, of San Francisco; and 11
grandchildren.
   Services are planned Tuesday in Christ Church Christiana
Hundred, Greenville. Burial will be private.

<HEAD>Chinese Pull Out Of Conference Over Dalai Lama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China, expressing displeasure at the
attendance of the Dalai Lama, pulled out of an international
meeting of religious leaders and lawmakers discussing global
problems, the organizers said.
   ``We worked hard to get the Chinese here because we are
discussing issues of great concern to them, like population
growth,'' said the Rev. James Parks Morton, a co-chairman of the
Global Conference of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders on Human
Survival.
   Morton, dean of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine
in New York, said the leaders of the world's most populous nation
had earlier shown a willingness to attend the five-day conference,
which was to open today.
   ``But although we had no formal complaint from the Chinese
government about the attendance of the Dalai Lama, we did get a
letter from one of their bigwigs saying they were not coming
because he was here,'' Morton said.
   Akio Matsumura, a Japanese living in New York who organized the
conference in the university city of Oxford, visited Beijing to
invite the Chinese.
   ``We are disappointed that they aren't coming, but we will
communicate closely with them with a view to involving them in our
future activities,'' Morton said in an interview.
   The Dalai Lama, the religious and civil leader of Tibet before
the 1950 Chinese Communist takeover, fled to India in 1959.
   China recently said the Dalai Lama could return to China
provided he accepts Chinese rule in Tibet. He said he will not
accept a Chinese offer to return but was willing to negotiate with
China.
   China maintains it has held sovereignty over Tibet since the
13th century. Tibetan independence advocates say the remote
Himalayan region enjoyed de facto independence for most of that
time.
   On March 5, China arrested 200 people in an independence protest
in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, the fourth against Chinese rule
there in five months. On Oct. 1, thousands of Tibetans led by
Buddhist monks stormed and set fire to a police station in Lhasa.
At least 14 people died.
   Morton said the Dalai Lama was attending the conference in
London ``as a pre-eminent theologian known worldwide for his
commitment to world peace and universal human causes.''
   On Tuesday, the Dalai Lama will address the conference on the
universal human condition.
   About 200 people from at least 60 countries are attending the
conference, including Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Moslem and Jewish
leaders.
   The meeting will discuss how participants will work together on
the threat of nuclear war, terrorism and urban violence, population
control, poverty, pollution, conservation and education.
   Matsumura, a family planning expert, said the main financial
sponsors were Shingo Nomura, a Japanese real estate developer, who
put up $500,000, and three other benefactors who contributed
$300,000 each.

   Moslem insurgents attacked the northwestern Afghan
city of Maimaneh with rockets and artillery, killing 13 people and
causing serious damage, the Tass news agency said today.
   The attack was on the same city from which a Soviet-built
Antonov-26 plane took off for Mazar Sharif, 145 miles to the east,
on Sunday. Official Kabul Radio said the plane was shot down by
rebels, killing all 29 people aboard.
   ``Oppositionists brought down rocket and artillery fire on the
town of Maimaneh, killing 13 people, among them women and children,
wounding four people and inflicting considerable destruction upon
the town,'' Tass said.
   It did not say when the attack occurred, or provide any more
information. Maimaneh is located 90 miles south of the Soviet
border.
   Tass also reported that government forces had discovered a rebel
arms cache including recoilless rifles, grenade launchers, small
arms and ammunition in Helmand province. It said a group of
insurgents had been routed by government forces in Balkh province,
and that eight of them had been taken prisoner.
   The fighting took place as Pakistan and Afghanistan were
preparing to sign a U.N.-sponsored agreement in Geneva to end the
Afghan conflict. Pakistan shelters millions of Afghans who have
fled the fighting, and many Afghan guerrilla groups have bases in
Pakistan.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced
one pro-Soviet government with another, and remained to fight the
Moslem insurgents.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said the estimated
115,000 Soviet soldiers will begin leaving on May 15 if an
agreement is signed soon in Geneva.
   The agreements call for all Soviet soldiers to be out of
Afghanistan in nine months.

   An investigation into a small plane crash
that killed the state's leading Republican gubernatorial candidate
and his pilot has found no malfunctioning instruments, federal
officials said.
   Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, 39, and pilot James Morris,
64, died Friday night when their Cessna 310 twin-engine plane
crashed while attempting to land on instruments in a snow squall.
   Waltermire was returning home to Helena from a candidates' forum
in Glasgow.
   The cause of the crash has not been determined.
   ``So far there's really nothing,'' Nick Wantiez of the Federal
Aviation Administration said Sunday. ``It's probably going to be
several days.''
   Verlin Tranter, an investigator with the National Transportation
Safety Board, said initial checks uncovered no malfunctioning
instruments, either on the ground or aboard the plane.
   Morris was an experienced pilot, with more than 17,000 hours of
flight experience, and was a highly regarded commercial and
instrument flight instructor, officials said.
   Waltermire was an often controversial figure who in eight years
parlayed the backwater post of secretary of state into a highly
visible state office and a launching platform for the governor's
chair.
   Two of his principal rivals for the Republican nomination
praised him.
   ``He was a worthy contender for governor,'' said former state
Sen. Stan Stephens of Havre. Rep. Cal Winslow of Billings called
his death ``a great loss to Montana.'' Both had debated Waltermire
in Glasgow before his fatal flight.
   Gov. Ted Schwinden recalled the 1962 plane crash death of Gov.
Donald Nutter. Waltermire's accident should serve as a reminder to
all candidates ``to put their safety and the requirements of their
personal family ahead of political commitments,'' he said.
   ``Montana's a tough state to fly,'' he said.``We've all had too
many accidents. We've lost a governor and now we've lost a
gubernatorial candidate and a secretary of state, which I think
ought to emphasize the risks associated with pushing your luck in
Montana politics.''
   Chuck Brooke, Waltermire's campaign manager, said a wake would
be held for Waltermire Tuesday night at the Cathedral of St. Helena.

<HEAD>Hot Line Aims To Bring Spies In From The Cold</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to reflect that hot line started one year ago.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FORT MEADE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A toll-free spy hotline that urges
soldiers to report suspicious activity and colleagues who receive
phone calls from people with foreign accents has fielded more than
20,000 calls, an official said.
   But William Dwyer, a civilian Army employee who for the past
year has run the nationwide hotline from a windowless room at Forte
Meade, says it has not led to any celebrated arrests.
   ``I know for a fact that there are investigations ongoing,''
Dwyer said, adding that the calls have sparked several espionage
probes by the military and the FBI. ``I have heard we have provided
significant leads.''
   Although the hot line, 1-800-CALL-SPY, is designed for Army
personnel across the country, most callers are civilians, Dwyer
said.
   About 1 percent of the inquiries have provided worthwhile
espionage or security-related tips, which are passed on to federal
investigators ranging from U.S. Army intelligence to the FBI, he
said.
   ``It's been effective,'' said Lt. Col. John Ooley, a spokesman
for the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command in Arlington,
Va.
   ``The hot line, like any hot line, is an excellent resource for
people to report this type of activity,'' FBI spokesman William
Carter said.
   Fliers advertising the hot line urge soldiers to watch for
colleagues who receive calls from ``someone with a foreign accent''
or ``brag about ... `James Bond'-type activities.'' Other telltale
spy signs are ``a lot of unexplained money'' or odd requests ``for
a manual, document or plan.''
   The warnings might seem a bit melodramatic, Dwyer admitted.
``Sound stupid? Yeah,'' he said. ``But these are actual cases.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union says it has concerns about
the possibility of abuse.
   ``It's inviting mischief,'' said Jerry Berman, chief legislative
counsel with the ACLU in Washington, D.C. ``The allegations can
have very serious consequences for someone.''
   Dwyer conceded that the program might appear troublesome.
   ``Some people look at this and say, `My God! Big Brother,''' he
said. ``That is the furthest thing from our minds.''
   Any information received over the phone is checked by several
supervisors before it is sent to federal investigators, he said.

   Sandy Lyle captured the 52nd Masters title
by one stroke with a 12-foot putt set up by a dramatic extrication
from a bunker on the last hole.
   Lyle, a Scotsman who won the 1985 British Open, became the first
British subject to ever win the Masters tournament. His score for
Sunday's round was a 1-under-par 71 for a tournament total of 281,
seven shots under par.
   Mark Calcavecchia, who was a caddy as recently as three years
ago, finished second with a 2-under-par 70 in the bright, warm
sunshine. He had a 282 total.
   Craig Stadler, the 1982 Masters winner, once had a share of the
lead, but bogied the 16th hole and finished third at 283. Another
former champion, Ben Crenshaw, followed at 284 with a 72. Jack
Nicklaus, the only six-time winner of the Masters, was at 292 after
a 72, putting him in a tie for 20th place.
   Lyle had to come out of a yawning fairway bunker on the 18th
hole of the Augusta National Golf Club course.
   ``I thought it was over,'' he said. ``That bunker has a steep
face and I didn't think I could get the ball over the lip onto the
green.''
   His ball hit beyond the cup and backed up toward the hole while
spectators howled. Lyle, who had blown a two-shot lead earlier in
the day, then made the birdie putt to win the title.
   In addition to the famed green winner's jacket, Lyle collected
$183,800 from the total purse of $1 million.

<TEXT>
   Even though the ceremony is in Los Angeles you
just CAN'T stay home, but how do you avoid mixing with the hoi
polloi?
   For the last nine years celebs stuck in the Big Apple could pick
up a little Oscar glamour by watching the ceremonies on television
while rubbing famous elbows at Polly Bergen's Park Avenue digs.
   But this year Ms. Bergen has just finished a television movie
and is preparing to act in several pilots, so she herself is in Los
Angeles.
   So there's no giant New York soiree for the likes of Helen
Gurley Brown, Gay Talese, Nora Ephron, Barbara Walters and even
Paul Newman.
   Well, not quite. Ms. Walters is inviting a few friends over to
watch her hourlong yak with a couple of actors right before the
Oscars, but it is not an official Oscar party.
   ``I'm not going to give the Polly party,'' Ms. Walters said.
   Ms. Bergen says the party _ for up to 240 people _ has been
going on for so many years that some may not know she's not
throwing it.
   ``I've been getting long distance calls form people who feel
stranded,'' she said. ``It's possible that some people will show up
on the doorstep, poor dears, and never even realize that there is
not party this year.''
   Ms. Bergen herself is going to the dime-a-celebrity party thrown
annually in L.A. by literary agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar.

million households in February 1987 to 1.961 million this year,
figures released by Arbitron on Saturday indicate.
   It was on Feb. 21 that Swaggart admitted to sinning against his
wife and family in a tearful confession from the pulpit at his
Baton Rouge Family Worship Center. Although Swaggart did not
specify his sin, it reportedly involved a New Orleans prostitute.
   The Pentecostal minister resigned from the Assemblies of God
church on Friday, the same day national church officials moved to
defrock him.
   He said he was leaving the denomination because his $140 million
per year ministry could not survive if he accepted a one-year
preaching ban imposed by national Assemblies officials.
   Swaggart also said Friday he would stay out of the pulpit until
May 22nd in accordance with a three-month preaching ban proposed by
the Assemblies' Louisiana elders. He led the choir in his Baton
Rouge church on Sunday, but did not offer a sermon.
   How Swaggart's television ministry has been affected by the
scandal will be more accurately measured when new Arbitron figures
for May are released this summer.
   In February's ratings, his daily program ``A Study in the Word''
fell from 410,000 households to 323,000 households. It is rated
No.10 in religious programming, the results show.
   Swaggart's audience fell by 200,000 households or 10 percent
during the year for the weekly program and by 87,000 households or
22 percent on a daily basis, according to Arbitron.
   Most of the top ten television evangelists lost ground during
the one-year period. No.3 ``World Tomorrow'' was the only Top Ten
show that grew, from 1.14 million households last year to 1.286
million this year.
   The Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwell's show dropped 40
percent. The PTL program, once hosted by defrocked Assemblies of
God minister Jim Bakker and his wife, Tammy, did not crack the Top
20. It was rated No. 18 in November 1987, when the last ratings
were taken.
   Television is the primary source of revenue for Swaggart's
ministry and the endeavor on which the most money is spent. The
ministry's own figures show it spends twice as much money on
television time as on foreign missions.
   Ministry literature, which claimed a worldwide viewership of 510
million in 1986, now claims 300 million.
   In mid-March, Swaggart's wife Frances and son Donnie hosted a
week-long telethon during which they begged viewers to send money
or use their credit cards to make donations to keep the Baton
Rouge-based ministry alive.

<HEAD>Navy, Families, Mark 25th Anniversary of Nation's Worst Submarine
Disaster</HEAD>

   The 129 men who died 25 years ago in the
nation's worst submarine disaster did not die in vain, the son of
one of the victims said at a memorial service.
   ``Many, many lives have been saved because those guys gave their
lives,'' said Neil Collier at Sunday's service. His father died
aboard the USS Thresher, which failed to surface from a deep dive
off the New England coast on April 10, 1963.
   The 275-year-old North Church was decorated Sunday with Easter
lilies and a model of the nuclear submarine the Navy said could
dive deeper and go faster than any other sub in the fleet.
   Cmdr. Lawrence Shoberg, a Navy chaplain, reminded more than 800
relatives and friends of the dead how Thresher left Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard for sea trials 220 miles off the New England coast.
   ``No scar was visible on the surface of the restless ocean to
show where she sank,'' Shoberg said. ``But there would be scars:
scars on the hearts of parents without children, wives without
husbands, children without fathers.''
   As the sub sank water pressure crushed the hull, killing all the
men on board. Thresher's remains lie more than a mile down on the
ocean bottom.
   Retired Rear Adm. Dean Axene, who commanded the Thresher until
three months before the tragedy, shared the task of breaking news
of the deaths to the families on April 10, 1963.
   Axene said Sunday that the Thresher, in his mind, ``remains a
mighty ship, manned by a mighty crew still sailing the sea.''
   ``She was intended to reach a new peak of perfection. And she
did, but the price was very high,'' Axene said.
   A Navy board concluded the sub's problems probably started with
a leak in saltwater piping. The board said water had shorted out
electrical circuits and shut down the nuclear reactor, leaving the
submarine powerless.
   The Navy developed a program that included stricter construction
methods, design improvements, testing for saltwater piping and more
initial shallow-water sea trials.
   Collier read the names of the dead at Sunday's service, which
included a 40-minute choral requiem accompanied by harp and violin.
   When the two-hour memorial ended, the Marines offered a 21-gun
salute outside the church, while the shipyard sounded a 21-cannon
salute and churches tolled their bells.
   While some cried as they left the church, many people hugged and
chatted with friends they hadn't seen in years.
   Joan Lyman of San Antonio, Texas, lost her husband John in the
tragedy.
   She attended services with another widow, Edna DiNola of Rye,
N.H.
   ``The people from Thresher are my extended family,'' said Lyman
who has not remarried. ``They're your support group. We've been
through it all together.''

   Although President Reagan has not been ``a
hands-on leader'' in the Iran-Contra affair, he will be able to
handle Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev if push comes to shove at
the summit in Moscow, former president Richard M. Nixon said today.
   ``Ronald Reagan can certainly handle him as a heavyweight,
provided Ronald Reagan has the kind of advice he as a leader should
have as president of the United States, provided he is
well-briefed,'' Nixon said in the second of four consecutive days
on NBC.
   In an hour-long interview on the network's ``Meet the Press''
show Sunday, Nixon said the president should pardon John M.
Poindexter and Oliver L. North if he believes they engineered the
Iran-Contra deal to serve the presidency.
   Nixon said that he regrets not absolving his own advisers for
their role in the Watergate scandal.
   Appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program this morning, Nixon said
there is no question there has been a tendency to underestimate
Reagan ``because he sometimes forgets something or doesn't handle
press conferences well.''
   But, Nixon said, Reagan proved he could handle Gorbachev at
their summit in Reykjavik, Iceland when he ``finally said no when
it was a bad deal.''
   ``With what happened in the Iran-Contra thing, certainly he was
not hands on,'' said Nixon. ``He is hands on where it really
matters.''
   The former president had stressed the necessity for such a
leader in his new book, ``1999,'' which he is promoting with the
television apperances and other interviews.
   Nixon said the most significant foreign policy achievement of
the Reagan administration will be the withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan _ ``because it is the first time the Soviet Union
has withdrawn forces from a country it invaded.'' Without Soviet
troop support, he said, he doubts Afghanistan's communist
government can survive.
   Nixon, who will be appear again on ``Today'' Tuesday and
Wednesday, discussed possible pardons for Poindexter and North
Sunday in the most extensive of the interviews.
   The former president, who was driven from office in 1974 by
Watergate, said Reagan should ask himself, ``Did these two men do
what they did, believing, whether mistakenly or not, that they had
the approval of the president, or were acting in order to serve his
interests and would get that approval?
   ``If the president, after considering that, believes that that
was the case, then he, the president, would have a good case for
pardoning, because then the so-called crime would lack in intent,''
Nixon said.
   Poindexter, the former national security adviser, and North, who
served as a National Security Council aide, face charges of
conspiring to divert proceeds of U.S.-Iran arms sales to the
Nicaraguan rebels at a time when Congress banned military aid to
the Contras.
   Reagan has made several comments indicating he believes his
former aides did nothing illegal and suggesting that he is
favorably inclined toward pardons. But his official position on the
subject remains one of neutrality, according to White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Nixon said that in the early 1970s he asked himself about
pardoning former advisers H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman.
Both were convicted on charges of conspiracy and obstruction of
justice and served time in prison.
   ``I probably should have pardoned them,'' Nixon said. ``I'm not
sure that the country would have taken it at that time _ it was a
little stirred up, as you might imagine. But, on the other hand,
they had not done it for personal gain.''
   The former president said ``personal gain'' also was not a
consideration in the Iran-Contra affair.
   On ``Meet the Press,'' the 75-year-old Nixon also was questioned
about Attorney General Edwin Meese III, U.S.-Israel relations and
Vietnam.
   _On Meese, who is under investigation, Nixon said there are
three points for the president to consider:
   ``One, is he an honest man; and two, has he been a competent
attorney general; and three, is he a political liability. ... I
think he is an honest man. As far as the second matter is
concerned, President Reagan believes he's a competent attorney
general in carrying out his conservative agenda. The third point,
however, is the one you're really addressing, and that is, is he a
political liability. And that's something only he (Reagan) can
answer.''
   _On U.S-Israel relations: ``The problems in the Mideast are so
complex that it can't be done by the secretary of state on a
part-time basis. ... There has to be the appointment of a full-time
heavyweight negotiator, and that appointment should be made ... to
Henry Kissinger. Now, Henry is devious, Henry is difficult, some
people think he's obnoxious _ but he's a terrific negotiator. And I
would suggest that the next president, be it (Michael) Dukakis or
(George) Bush, would be well-advised to give him the title of
ambassador plenipotentiary, give him a year, and he will work out
some settlement.''
   _On Vietnam: ``I would say the major mistake I made as president
was ... not doing early in 1969 what I did on May 3 of 1972 and on
Dec. 15 of 1972, and that was to bomb and mine North Vietnam. ...
If we had done that then, I think we would have ended the war in
Vietnam in 1969 rather than in 1973.''

<TEXT>
   A two-state public-health alert for
pesticide-contaminated cucumbers is in effect in Washington and
Oregon following illness in two Seattle-area families.
   The cucumbers, contaminated with aldicarb, were distributed by
wholesalers to grocers in those two states and possibly northern
California and Idaho, said Roger Lowell, district director for the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Seattle.
   Symptoms of the infected cucumbers include nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea within one hour of eating, usually within 30 minutes,
Lowell said Sunday. Other symptoms can include blurred vision,
excessive sweating and muscle twitching.
   Lowell said officials were unaware of any permanent health
damage, adding that the symptoms pass quickly, like influenza. In
fact, he said, many people in the area who thought they had the flu
in the last week may have actually been suffering from the
pesticide.
   Both cucumber-related illnesses were in the Seattle area, said
Frank Mendizabal of the Department of Social and Health Services.
The health alerts in Oregon and Washington took effect Saturday,
although no illnesses were reported in Oregon.
   The cucumbers are European style, 12 to 18 inches long and about
1{ inches in diameter with pointed ends. They are wrapped in clear,
unlabeled plastic, Lowell said.
   Any skinny cucumbers without labels are considered suspect, said
Lowell, but those with a brand-name label showing they were grown
elsewhere are considered safe.
   The cucumbers were grown in hothouses in northern California by
Barnard Hydroponic of Redding and distributed by Blue Anchor, Inc.,
of Sacramento, Lowell said.
   Bruce Barnard, an owner of Barnard Hydroponic, refused to
comment in a Sunday telephone interview from his home in Redding,
Calif., saying he wanted to talk with FDA officials first.
   Aldicarb is used to treat soil before crops are grown and is
used mostly for non-food crops, including cotton. Use of the
pesticide on growing food products is illegal, Lowell said.

   Harassment by white college students and cold
shoulders from white professors are among the problems reported by
black students who attend predominantly white schools.
   ``They just don't want us there,'' Michelle Dye said of her
white peers at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. She was among
those attending a seminar on issues facing black students at white
schools.
   ``I've been fighting since my first quarter,'' she said,
recalling how she was shot in the leg with a BB gun while walking
by a men's dorm on the south Georgia campus. ``It's pathetic to go
through that kind of stuff while you're trying to get an
education.''
   At Louisiana State University of New Orleans, a white fraternity
displayed a rebel flag last year during the Martin Luther King Jr.
Day parade on campus, according to student Frederick Barrow.
   In an era when many blacks attend predominantly white
institutions, such racial incidents are not unusual, according to
more than 300 students and faculty from 14 states who participated
in the Georgia State University seminar. The seminar ended Saturday.
   Statistics from the Southern Regional Education Board show that
more than 66 percent of the nations 1.08 million black college
students now attend predominantly white institutions.
   More than a dozen traditionally black colleges have closed in
the last two decades, and still others are being merged with white
institutions.
   At the seminar, some black students complained that white
faculty members didn't devote enough time to them.
   ``It's sad when you see the professor has time to talk with
white students after class, but when a black approaches that same
professor, then all of a sudden he has to rush off to his office.
That really hurts,'' said Kevin Brown, a senior at Georgia
Southwestern College in Americus.
   Almost all students agreed that what they needed most was more
black faculty members. Even at schools where there are black
faculty, students say there are too few.
   At the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, said student
Madeline Shaw, ``there are only 10 black faculty members out of
500, and out of the 10, only two are tenured.''
   Some black faculty at white institutions say black students need
advice on how to cope with racial stress.
   ``I try to get across to them that there is racism, and it's not
going to go away, not in their lifetime,'' said black staff member
Dr. Cleon Arrington, associate vice president of research at GSU.
``But what they can do to cope with it is to strive for excellence,
not mediocrity. Only by being better than their white counterparts
will they have an equal share of the rewards.''
   Some whites feel that advances in race relations are gradually
coming about.
   ``For the most part, my generation is less bigoted than
generations past,'' said Doug Tudor, student president at Old
Dominion, ``but it's hard for some white students to overcome
racist attitudes if they were raised in a bigoted manner.''
   Ms. Shaw said negative racial attitudes can not be corrected by
students alone. ``One of the first steps to eliminating racism on
campuses is for the administration to take an official stand
against racist behavior of any kind.''
   Although integration has been urged by the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, some black students fear
they are losing part of their heritage.
   ``It's just another way whites are trying to take away some of
our black culture,'' said Todd Dunn, a senior at Georgia
Southwestern.
   Dunn and some fellow black students at Georgia Southwestern
recently organized the Concerned Students Association after a white
professor was accused by a black female student of calling her a
``black bitch.''
   In the days after the incident, 100 members of the association
occupied the campus administration building. Last Wednesday, the
students protested at a weekly assembly meeting because Towery was
suspended with pay rather than fired.

   The United Nations today accused
the Reagan administration of violating a U.N. treaty by trying to
close the PLO Mission in New York.
   The United Nations has asked the World Court for an opinion on
whether the U.S. government must accept arbitration in the dispute,
which emanates from anti-terrorist legislation signed by President
Reagan last December.
   That law, which classifies the Palestine Liberation Organization
as a terrorist group and bars it from operating on U.S. territory,
led the United States to order the closing of the PLO Mission to
the United Nations, a maneuver condemned by all U.N. member nations
except the United States and Israel.
   ``The (U.N.) secretary-general has the strong desire to avoid
any confrontation with the host country,'' a U.N.
undersecretary-general, Carl-August Fleischhauer of West Germany,
told the World Court today.
   But he stressed that the United Nations ``urges the court to
declare that indeed there is an obligation to the United States''
to submit the dispute to independent arbitration.
   Fleischhauer's remarks came during a 90-minute World Court
hearing. Neither the United States nor the PLO was officially
represented at the session.
   In a recent letter to the World Court, John Shad, U.S.
ambassador to the Netherlands, said his government does not
``believe arbitration would be appropriate'' because the case is
now before a U.S. court.
   The PLO is unable to plead its case here because only nation
states and U.N. bodies are entitled to appear before the World
Court.
   The World Court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, is the U.N.'s 15-member judicial branch. It has no
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its
rulings.
   In the case now under consideration, the United Nations claims
the United States is required to accept arbitration in the matter
under a 1947 accord between the world body and the Truman
administration.
   Under that pact, known as the Headquarters Agreement, disputes
between the U.S. government and the United Nations arising from the
U.N. presence in the United States must be settled by arbitration.
   The accord calls for a three-member arbitration panel, made up
of one member appointed by the U.N. secretary-general, one
appointed by the U.S. government, and one chosen by mutual consent.
   Although the accord does not specifically mention missions, the
United Nations maintains its rules concerning the unhindered
functioning of diplomats accredited to its headquarters in New York
also apply to the missions of member nations and organizations with
observer status.
   The PLO was granted non-voting observer status at the United
Nations in 1974. It has maintained an office in Manhattan since
then.
   Several weeks ago, the U.S. Justice Department filed suit in
U.S. District Court in New York after the PLO refused to close its
office there. The PLO was expected to respond in the U.S. case
today, and the United Nations was expected to file a brief
supporting the PLO position.
   The U.S. boycott of the World Court proceedings marks the second
time in four years that the Reagan administration has refused to
take part in one of its cases.
   The U.S. government claimed the court had no authority to handle
a complaint against it filed in 1984 by Nicaragua and boycotted the
last 17 months of the proceedings in that case. The World Court
ultimately ruled in favor of Nicaragua, and ordered the United
States to halt its support for the Contra rebels fighting
Nicaragua's Sandinista government.

   American and French hostages in Lebanon
will be killed if security forces storm a hijacked Kuwaiti jet in
Cyprus, a pro-Iranian group said in a statement.
   ``To the families of the hostages, we declare that we shall
execute the Western captives in Lebanon if the plane and holy
warrior (hijackers) aboard is subjected to any military
foolhardiness,'' the statement by the Shiite Moslem group Islamic
Jihad said.
   The threat was accompanied by photographs of two hostages,
journalists Terry A. Anderson, an American, and Jean-Paul Kauffmann
of France.
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the 22 foreigners missing after being
kidnapped in Lebanon. He was abducted March 16, 1985, in west
Beirut.
   Kauffmann, 43, was kidnapped May 22, 1985.
   The typed, Arabic-language statement was delivered Sunday to the
Reuters news agency in west Beirut.
   It declared full support for the hijackers' demand in Cyprus for
the release of 17 convicted pro-Iranian terrorists, all but one of
them Shiites, imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies in December 1983. Kuwait has refused to free them.
   The statement said the 17 were jailed for ``confronting the
centers of international arrogance in our Islamic homeland along
with regimes that sold themselves cheaply to the superpowers and
their interests in the region.''
   Islamic Jihad claims to hold three Frenchmen and another
American, Thomas Sutherland, 55, of Fort Collins, Colo. He was
kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Sutherland was acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut.
   Islamic Jihad has said the two other Frenchmen its men kidnapped
are Marcel Fontaine, 47, vice consul at the French Embassy,
abducted March 22, 1985, and Marcel Carton, 64, the embassy's
protocol officer, who was kidnapped in a separate attack the same
day.
   Today, a spokesman for Hezbollah, or Party of God, said his
group was ``not involved in any way'' in the hijacking. Chief
spokesman Sheik Ibrahim el-Amin, speaking to reporters in west
Beirut, declined to say if his group supports the hijackers' demand
for release of prisoners in Kuwait.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella organization for the
Shiite extremist factions holding many of the foreign hostages in
Lebanon. Hezbollah has never claimed responsibility for kidnapping
a foreigner.
   El-Amin also said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins was
``not kidnapped but detained.''
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was serving with a U.N.
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was kidnapped near Tyre
on Feb. 17.
   El-Amin denied his group had been involved in Higgins' capture,
which has been claimed by the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth.

<TEXT>
   A pioneering programming executive for the Z
Channel pay television service apparently shot his wife to death
and then turned the gun on himself, authorities said.
   Gerald Harvey, 39, a vice president at the Santa Monica-based
service, was found dead in his Westwood home, along with his wife
of one year, Frederica, ``Deri'' Rudulth, also 39, on Saturday,
said Z Channel spokesman Harry Clein.
   Harvey was listed as a suicide and his wife as a homicide
victim, Los Angeles County coroner's office investigator Paul
Willis said Sunday.
   A police report said Harvey was believed to be suffering from a
mental disorder.
   ``He had been sick all last week,'' Clein said. ``He had an
ulcer and I guess he was bothered by it. He wasn't in the office,
but he felt better Friday.''
   Harvey joined the Z Channel in 1980 and was credited with
attracting an influential entertainment industry audience to the
14-year-old service.
   As programming chief, Harvey developed the popular and
successful format that combined classic, European and artistic
films with high-powered Hollywood movies. This month, the channel
added Los Angeles Dodgers and California Angels home games to its
line-up.
   Under Harvey's direction, Z broadcast the uncut versions of such
films as ``Heaven's Gate,'' ``1900,'' ``Fanny and Alexander'' and
``Das Boot.''
   Ms. Rudulth, a former attorney and stand-up comedian, also
published the Westwood Insider, a free weekly newspaper that
circulated in the upscale west side of Los Angeles.
   Next-door neighbor Mary Pringle said she was pruning roses
around Saturday afternoon when she thought she heard a gunshot. She
said she disregarded the noise as probably children playing, but
then heard a second shot about an hour later.
   ``(Ms. Rudulth) was an exemplary neighbor for me,'' Pringle
said. ``I didn't really know him. He seemed to be an odd person.
He'd apparently been having nervous problems, and she was
vulnerable and was there.''
   The slayings occurred two days before Harvey was to have given a
deposition in a lawsuit filed by Z Channel against rival cable
television service Home Box Office, the nation's largest.
   The suit contends the HBO, which is owned by Time Inc.,
``secured or coerced'' the cooperation of four major film studios
in ``restraining and impairing'' Z Channel's ability to compete
with HBO.
   ``I think Jerry was concerned,'' said Clein. ``The Z Channel was
a great love of his. But I think he felt things were going along
well, and that in view of the suit that Z had a good case.''

<HEAD>Air Force Base Plans To Demolish Building It Just Renovated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCOTT AIR FORCE BASE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scott Air Force Base officials
are planning to knock down a recently renovated building and make a
parking lot, despite workers' complaints that the Air Force is
wasting money.
   Workers and the president of the union representing civilian
employees at Scott criticized the Air Force for sinking $161,000
into a building they planned to demolish.
   But 1st Lt. Jerry Lobb, a base spokesman, said Building 1522 was
renovated earlier this year to improve working conditions because a
specific date to tear down the building had not yet been set.
   The building is near a $19 million Air Force Communications
Command facility that is under construction and targeted for
completion in June 1989, said Staff Sgt. Jerry Anderson, another
base spokesman.
   Lobb said Building 1522, now used as office space, would be
razed at some point to provide room for parking space for the new
command center.
   Carl Denton, president of Local R7-23 of the National
Association of Government Employees, said union officials
questioned the need for the renovation during meetings with base
management to discuss money-saving measures.
   ``There's nothing you can do if they've already spent money.
Once it's spent, it's gone, so we concentrated on things that could
be avoided. But (this kind of project) is what we said was work
that was not necessary,'' Denton said.

<HEAD>People Drinking Less, But Character Of The Change Unclear.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People seem to be drinking less, and they worry
about alcohol more, but health researchers disagree about what it
means.
   ``Overall, there's a clear trend in the direction of
moderation,'' said Jay Winsten, director of the Center for Health
Communication at the Harvard School of Public Health.
   ``In terms of social mores, the public message used to be that
it's cool to get smashed. Now, it's dumb to get drunk.''
   The cutback in consumption grows in part from recent court
rulings in some states recognizing host liability for drunken
guests, he told The Boston Globe.
   ``Legal deterrence is a major factor in the moderation, but I
think it goes beyond that,'' he said. ``There is just much more
informal social pressure not to drink as much.''
   But Dr. Henry Wechsler, associate executive director of the
Medical Foundation in Boston, said the move to curb excess involves
a limited part of society.
   ``I still think we have a six-pack syndrome out there in much of
our society, and the data is there to support it,'' he said.
``Alcohol consumption has dropped, but not markedly and young
people are drinking as much as ever.''
   Massachusetts legislator Rep. Suzanne Bump filed legislation
last week to put warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers in
the state.
   ``The bottom line is that alcohol is still the nation's drug of
choice and a major health problem, especially among young people,''
she said.
   A recent Gallup Poll showed that the number of adults who
believe that alcohol is a problem in their homes has doubled since
1974 to 24 percent.
   In 1980, per person consumption was 2.5 gallons of liquor, 2.6
gallons of wine and 30.7 gallons of beer. In 1985, liquor use
dropped to 2.2 gallons, beer eased off to 29.6 gallons, but wine
consumption rose to 2.9 gallons.
   Eddie Burke, co-owner of Doyle's, an Irish pub in Boston, said
the bar now sells five cases of nonalcoholic beer weekly, while
three years ago there were no takers.
   ``People are just drinking less, although they're drinking more
of the quality stuff,'' Burke said, adding that his bartenders now
shut off patrons more quickly.

<HEAD>Naturalists Worried About Wood Storks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wood storks have come home to roost in southern
Florida, but but naturalists are worried that the endangered birds
won't have a chance to rear their young before the rainy season.
   Summer deluges at the storks' two major ancestral breeding
grounds would drench nestlings and disperse the fish the birds rely
on for food, they explained.
   Last week, 620 pairs of wood storks were nesting at Corkscrew
Swamp Sanctuary, a National Audubon Society refuge about 20 miles
north of Naples that was once the primary stork-nesting area in
North America. Another 75 pairs have taken up residence at
Everglades National Park's Cuthbert Island.
   The two sites were believed to have been all but abandoned by
North America's sole species of stork, a giant white bird with an
iron-black head.
   ``We are ecstatic to be able to report these numbers,'' said
Paul Hinchcliff, chief naturalist at Corkscrew. ``Whether or not
there's enough time before the start of the rainy season to fledge
enough young remains to be seen.''
   Almost all previous attempts to nest so late in the year have
ended disastrously, said John Ogden, who heads a wood stork study
team at Everglades National Park. If they are unable to feed
offspring, parent birds will abandon the colony, leaving hundreds
of crying young birds to starve.
   Wood storks have not produced offspring in significant numbers
at Corkscrew since 1984-85, when 353 pairs of birds successfully
raised 530 young. Fifty years ago, it was common to see 6,000 to
8,000 pairs of storks nesting in the gray-boughed cypress trees.
   Since the early 1960s, however, storks have been spurning
Corkscrew in favor of central and northern Florida and other
Southern states. Between 1960 and 1980, the wood stork nesting
population at Corkscrew dropped by 75 percent.
   The renewed Corkscrew colony represents almost 30 percent of the
total U.S. stork population, estimated at 4,000.
   Historically, storks came to Corkscrew by the tens of thousands
to nest in early winter, leaving plenty of time to rear offspring
before the onset of rain.
   But human activity disrupted the annual cycle of high-water
summers and low-water winters in Florida's wetlands. Much of the
area that provided shallow feeding waters for wood storks during
the early winter has been drained for farming or sudivisions. The
birds have been forced to wait until late winter or spring for the
deeper waters of the interior Everglades to drop low enough for
them to efficiently feed.
   As result, nesting is delayed, and this year's young won't be
ready to leave their nests until about mid-July, Ogden said.

<TEXT>
   A 25-year-old former Boy
Scout allegedly attacked his old scoutmaster with a knife after a
chance meeting brought back memories of a 12-year-old grudge over a
merit badge, police said.
   John F. Wilbert was held on $110,000 bail in the assault on
Harold W. Scott Jr., 55, police said.
   Wilbert told authorities that Scott had kept him waiting too
long when he went to his home as an eighth-grader to work on a
merit badge project.
   Wilbert, a Navy veteran, did not see Scott again until he passed
him on the street two weeks ago, said Little Silver police Capt.
Thomas F. Bruno.
   Scott says he doesn't remember Wilbert, who grew up here and now
lives a few miles away in Long Branch, but Bruno said the chance
encounter prompted ``flashbacks'' for Wilbert.
   On Thursday night, Wilbert rang Scott's door bell, Bruno said.
When Scott answered, Wilbert slashed him about the head and upper
body, Bruno alleged.
   Scott, who retired in January after 21 years as a scoutmaster,
bit Wilbert, wrestled the knife away, ran back into the house and
called police, Bruno said.
   Wilbert was caught while he headed to his car parked nearby,
Bruno said. He was charged with attempted murder and, because
police said they found tools in Wilbert's car like those that would
be used in a burglary, he also was charged with burglary.
   Scott was hospitalized briefly for treatment of multiple
lacerations.

<TEXT>
   Parents are sewing identification labels
into their children's clothing. Teen-age girls are heading home
early. And volunteers are sifting through the desert sands looking
for more bodies after finding six young women buried in shallow
graves.
   Residents in northeastern El Paso are dealing with the slayings
of the six young women, ages 14 to 24, in many ways while the
city's police chief calls on residents to be careful, not alarmed.
   In response, far fewer young women can be found loitering around
bars, convenience stores and motels, even on warm spring nights.
   ``(The slayings) brought it home to them that maybe they're not
invulnerable,'' says Rebecca Wylie, head counselor at Parkland High
who consoled friends of 14-year-old Dawn Smith, a Parkland dropout
whose remains were discovered Oct. 20.
   ``They're more careful about walking out by themselves. They're
more conscious about coming home by their curfew,'' Ms. Wylie said.
   The killings also inspired a community group to give elementary
school children identification cards to be sewn into their clothing
or laced into their shoes.
   ``One thing we've noticed in seeing pictures of grave sites or
even auto accidents is that there is always a shoe at the scene,''
said Stan Roberts, president of the Northeast El Paso Civic
Association, which ordered 10,000 tags for students.
   The police investigation centers around the deaths of Angelica
Jeanette Frausto, 17; Karen Baker, 20; Maria Rosa Casio, 24;
Desiree Wheatley, 15; Ivy Susanna Williams, 23; and Miss Smith.
   Frausto was last seen behind a tavern in northeast El Paso.
Baker was last spotted getting into a car at a motel on the same
street. Her body and Casio's were found Sept. 4 buried among
creosote bushes in the desert 18 miles northeast of El Paso.
   Since then, the bodies of the four other young women were found
in shallow graves in the same litter-strewn patch of desert. Police
are almost certain the women were victims of the same killer but
refuse to discuss most aspects of the case.
   David Leonard Wood, a convicted sex offender, was described as a
possible suspect in the case by a detective testifying at Wood's
rape trial.
   Wood, 30, who had been jailed since his Oct. 23 arrest on the
rape charge, was convicted last month and sentenced to 50 years for
his fourth sex crime conviction.
   His victim testified that he kidnapped her last summer, took her
to an area near where the bodies were later found, and started
digging a hole. When he heard voices, he took the woman across the
street, raped her and left her naked in the desert.
   About a month after that attack, the first body _ that of Casio
_ was discovered by a utility employee digging at the site. Police
searched the area that day and found Ms. Baker's remains about 50
yards away.
   Police scoured a 10-square-mile area with borrowed heat-sensing
equipment mounted on airplanes. The Department of Corrections also
provided dogs to sniff for more bodies. On Oct. 20, the dogs found
the remains of Miss Smith and Miss Wheatley within a half-mile of
the first two.
   On Nov. 2, police using dogs found the remains of Miss Frausto.
   Police gave up searching a few weeks later, saying they were
confident they had found all the bodies buried in the area.
   But on March 14 _ the first day of Wood's rape trial _ a pair of
aluminum-can collectors stumbled upon the bones of Ms. Williams.
   The last two victims were not among three young women from
northeast El Paso and neighboring Chaparral, N.M., who are listed
by police as missing.
   Last weekend, more than 300 searchers failed to unearth more
bodies.Volunteers carrying shovels and pitchforks included
soldiers, jail guards, police officers, sheriff's deputies and
reserves, fire marshals and chaplains.
   Deputy Police Chief Gus Massey said although no bodies were
found, they may go back and do it ``over and over again'' next
weekend.

<TEXT>
   Pakistan began three days of official
mourning today after an ammunition depot blast that officials said
killed 93 people and wounded 1,100. Newspapers today reported more
than 100 dead.
   Hundreds of people who lived close to the army depot, located
between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, remained unaccounted for after
Sunday's blast.
   Pakistan Radio broadcast appeals for missing people, and Prime
Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo ordered the removal of dangerous
ordnance from populated areas.
   Pakistanis repaired their cinderblock houses or sifted through
the ruins in search of salvageable household goods. Rescuers
continued their search for victims.
   Police and army troops patrolled the dusty streets as entire
families roamed the worst-hit areas to view the damage and search
for loved ones.
   Officials said about 100 bomb disposal teams were clearing an
estimated 6,500 different kinds of projectiles that lay strewn
among the two cities.
   President Mohammad Zia Ul-haq today refused to speculate on the
cause of a fire which reportedly ignited the ammunition dump
between the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, showering both
with rockets, grenades and artillery shells.
   As to reports that the ordnance was earmarked for Afghan Moslem
insurgents, Zia said: ``It's nothing but speculation _ a high
measure of speculation.''
   Eyewitnesses reported seeing burning trucks near the depot
bearing Afghan license plates.
   Pakistan backs the guerrillas in their struggle against Kabul's
Marxist government and the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops who back
it. It also serves as a conduit for U.S. military aid to the
insurgents.
   Zia said the dead included seven army soldiers. He said 60
percent of the total number of wounded had been treated and
released.
   Official sources said the blast was caused by a fire but Western
diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had heard
reports of a possible military coup attempt. Some embassies said
they received anonymous telephone calls warning of a terrorist
bombing shortly before the facility blew up.
   The explosions, which occurred during morning rush hour Sunday,
sent missiles and grenades slamming into buildings, buses and cars
in the capital and the adjacent city of Rawalpindi.
   The initial blast flattened most buildings within 200 yards of
the depot and sprayed shrapnel and unexploded projectiles for more
than a six-mile radius.
   There were no reports of casualties among the estimated 25,000
foreigners who live in the capital.
   Also Sunday, eight people were killed in a fire at an arms
factory near Lahore, 140 miles south of Islamabad, and three people
were injured by a bomb that exploded in Karachi, 650 miles
southwest of Islamabad. Authorities said those two incidents
appeared unrelated to the disaster in Islamabad.
   In India, riots broke out today when mobs of students tried to
close shops in northern Kashmir state to show sympathy for the
victims of Sunday's explosion at the ammunition depot.
   The United News of India reported that scores were injured when
police clashed with the students.
   The news agency said the mobs set fire to an army jeep, burned
down a liquor store and stoned passing vehicles.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
Kashmir. Some of the Moslems, who predominate in Kashmir state,
want to unite with Pakistan.
   There have been numerous explosions and bomb attacks in Pakistan
during the past two years that have killed about 300 people and
injured hundreds.
   The government frequently has blamed attacks on agents of
Afghanistan's communist government, which has denounced Pakistani
support of Afghan rebels.
   Many bombings have also occurred during violent demonstrations
by opposition parties demanding the resignation of President Zia.
   The ammunition dump is located at Faizabad Crossing, near the
capital's border with Rawalpindi. Army troops and riot police were
deployed around Islamabad to seal off dangerous roads and prevent
panic.
   One of the dead was identified as a lawmaker and former minister
of production and public works, Khaqan Abbasi, whose car was hit by
a rocket.
   Islamabad is a city of 500,000 built during the 1960s to replace
Karachi as the capital. In addition to government buildings, it
contains about 85 foreign embassies and several offices of U.N. and
other international relief agencies.

   Karin Jackson has a knack for taking the lemons of
the cat world and turning out lemonade.
   Her latest victory came Sunday when a blue-spotted tabby named
Amy was given the 9-Lives Morris Award after being judged the best
household cat at Denver's Campaign Tails spring cat show.
   In fact, four of Jackson's six contestants swept the household
competition at the show, sponsored by the Foot of the Rockies Cat
Club Inc.
   Cages for Amy, Chip, Koko and Little Miss Muffet were covered
with so many red, white and blue ribbons that some had to be moved
so spectators could see the prize-winning felines.
   ``I'm doing very well, without boasting,'' said Jackson, who
said she is known as a ``cat lady'' back home in Salt Lake City.
   Jackson, a native of Germany, fell in love with cats shortly
after she came to the United States in 1961. Now she drives her
cats in a station wagon to competitions around the West.
   Purebred cats are judged on precise calculations of color, build
and hair length, Jackson said. Household pets are judged on health,
cleanlines, color and personality.
   Jackson fondly recalls Pedro, a stray dropped off in June 1979.
By April 1980, Pedro was named the best household cat in all of
North America, she said.
   Amy was abandoned with her siblings at Jackson's home when she
was 7 weeks old.
   Now, at 8 months, she's a prize-winner.
   ``She was so outgoing,'' Jackson said. ``A sweetheart. Easy to
handle. It shows that with proper care, good food _ no junk food _
medical attention ... and lots of love, you can make a throw-away,
dirty, neglected, undernourished cat a show cat.''

<HEAD>Panamanian Leader Says He'd Rather Be Somewhere Else</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
today was quoted as saying he would really rather be somewhere
else, but that he was fighting an American attempt to control
Panama.
   ``Ah yes,'' Noriega was quoted as telling the Paris newspaper Le
Monde in an interview published today. ``I would like to be
somewhere else.'' He did not say where.
   Although Noriega is ready to leave Panama, the newspaper said,
he is not ready to be pushed out.
   ``Foreigners have trouble understanding our mentality,'' Noriega
was quoted as saying. ``It is a struggle that we have been waging
for a long time against the American presence here. It is not a
personal fight, but that of a people and a nation. It is the
destiny of a country that is at stake.''
   Le Monde said Noriega is convinced that President Reagan, who
always opposed the 1977 treaties turning over the Panama Canal to
Panama, wants to reclaim the canal.
   ``The attitude of the United States is very suspect,'' the
general was quoted as saying. ``We began to have problems with it
from the moment we denounced violations of the treaties, when we
defended an independent, Third World, non-aligned policy on the
international scene, and above all when we refused to participate
in a military intervention in Nicaragua to overthrow the Sandinista
regime.''
   He said Washington ``wants to rewrite history, cancel the
treaties by imposing a government controlled by them and reversing
social achievements.''
   Asked if his departure would not put an end to the crisis and
ease the suffering of the Panamanian people, Noriega said: ``I
refuse to answer that question,'' he said. ``If the people are
suffering, it is because of the United States, not me.''
   He brushed aside questions about his role in the drug trade.
   ``The problem is not here,'' he said. ``It is in the United
States. The United States is the consumer country. It is there that
the drugs are paid for. There are drug-producing countries and
there are consumer countries. The other countries, like Panama, are
passage routes.''
   The general agreed that Panama's liberal financial laws make it
easy for drug transactions, but he said ``the money was not
invested here ... therefore you cannot say that the laundering of
this drug money is done here. We were only a step in the process
controlled by the United States.''
   He said the United States was behind making Panama a banking
center, ``and it is they who have decided to dismantle it.''

   An opposition leader forced into
exile by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega left for Venezuela after
calling on Panamanians to step up protests designed to oust the
strongman.
   In another development, doctors and pharmacists on Sunday said a
lack of dollars brought on by U.S. economic sanctions has caused a
medicine shortage and broad cuts in hospital services in Panama.
   The opposition leader, Carlos Ernesto Gonzalez de la Lastra, in
a letter released before he left Sunday evening, urged Panamanians
to ``organize your family, your street, your neighborhood and
protest.''
   ``When you decide to protest in all the streets of all the
cities of the Panamanian isthmus and decide to do it every day, we
will reach victory.''
   The opposition leader was freed on Thursday after being
imprisoned for 10 days following his arrest during an anti-Noriega
march he led in Panama City.
   Gonzalez de la Lastra, 49, faced a long prison term on a
sedition charge filed by the government last summer if he did not
accept exile.
   In the past week several announced anti-Noriega demonstrations
either drew few participants or were stopped before they began by a
heavy police presence.
   Gonzalez de la Lastra is one of 35 leaders of the National Civic
Crusade, an opposition organization of 200 business, labor,
professional and political groups seeking Noriega's ouster.
   Sunday's departure was the second time the opposition leader had
been sent into exile. He lived in Venezuela for two years after
Gen. Omar Torrijos, Noriega's predecessor, ordered Gonzalez de la
Lastra into exile in 1976.
   In an interview published today, Noriega was quoted as saying
that he would rather be somewhere else than Panama, but that he was
fighting an American attempt to control Panama.
   ``Ah yes,'' the general was quoted as telling the Paris
newspaper Le Monde. ``I would like to be somewhere else.'' He did
not specify where.
   Le Monde said Noriega is convinced that President Reagan, who
opposed the 1977 treaties turning over the Panama Canal to Panama,
wants to take back the canal.
   He said Washington ``wants to rewrite history, cancel the
treaties by imposing a government controlled by them and reversing
social achievements.''
   Several other leaders of the anti-Noriega protests that began in
June 1987 went into exile in September after warrants were issued
for their arrests.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of Panama's Christian
Democratic Party, was barred from the country when he tried to
return from a business trip on Feb. 25. He was allowed back in at
the end of March.
   On Saturday, Arias Calderon called for an international boycott
that goes beyond existing U.S. sanctions to press for an end to the
Noriega regime.
   Noriega, as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, is the
power behind the civilian government. Last February, a federal
grand jury in Florida indicted Noriega on drug trafficking charges.
The United States imposed economic sanctions on Panama after
Noriega rejected Washington's demands that he resign and leave the
country.
   Panama uses the American dollar as its currency. U.S. sanctions
include freezing Panama's dollar deposits in U.S. banks,
withholding payments to the Panama Canal Commision and, most
recently, prohibiting American companies and citizens from paying
taxes to the Panamanian government.
   The taxes are to be paid to an account opened for deposed
President Eric Arturo Delvalle, ousted by the National Legislature
on Feb. 26 after he tried to fire Noriega. The United States still
recognizes Delvalle as president.
   With the most recent sanctions against Panama, some American
businessmen have said they can be fined and jailed in the United
States for paying taxes to the government and be closed down by
Panama if they don't.
   ``I think we're going to see a lot of closings,'' of American
companies in Panama, said one businessman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The economic crisis caused by the sanctions has prompted the
medicine shortage and hospital cutbacks, doctors and pharmacists
said on Sunday.
   Elective surgery, X-rays and laboratory tests have been
postponed, the sources said. At the Bella Vista Clinic, doctors
said the staff has been cut from 92 to 30. One pharmacist said he
was out of many medicines, including some antibiotics and heart
medicines. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The cash crisis has prompted Ricaurte Vazquez, minister of
planning and economic policy, to ask officials of the Latin
American Economic System for financial help from member governments
and banks.
   At a meeting in Venezuela two weeks ago, members of the
organization overwhelmingly passed a resolution supporting Panama
and condemning U.S. sanctions but did not come up with any money.
Most Latin American governments have severe financial problems of
their own.

   Democratic presidential contender Jesse Jackson tackled a
sensitive issue in New York's key primary by saying he would not
meet again with Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat. Rival Albert Gore Jr., who is playing up his own strong
support for Israel, said today he must finish strong in New York
for his campaign to continue.
   The New York primary, with its prize of 255 delegates, is eight
days away, and all three Democrats were stumping in the state
today. The trio had three debates scheduled this week _ their first
full-scale faceoffs since last month's Super Tuesday campaign.
   Vice President George Bush, bidding to stay in the spotlight
although he virtually has the Republican nomination wrapped up, was
beginning three days of campaigning in New York today. Bush's only
remaining rival, Pat Robertson, has all but abandoned his effort.
   Gore said he will remain in the race through the national
convention in July, but must turn in a convincing performance in
the primary.
   ``We're running to win here but at a minimum we have to have a
finish that convinces you ... that, well, Gore did it. He has the
momentum. He has the strength to go on,'' the Tennessee senator
said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Michael Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner, spent Sunday at
home in Boston celebrating the Greek Orthodox Easter with his
family. Jackson visited Harlem, while Gore campaigned in a heavily
Jewish part of Brooklyn.
   Jackson, who has been criticized by Jewish leaders for meeting
with Arafat, was asked Sunday whether he would do so again.
   ``I would not _ and it's not necessary to do that,'' he said on
CBS' ``Face the Nation.''
   Jackson said today in New York, ``It would not be a good
approach to start at the table with the most extreme elements.
That's a formula for catastrophe.''
   He added, ``In this city, some of your top Palestinian leaders
in the world live. Some of your top Jewish-American and pro-Israeli
leaders live here. We should begin to talk here to implore both
sides to a higher level of security.''
   In the interview on Sunday, Jackson went out of his way to be
conciliatory toward Gore.
   In recent days, Gore has blasted Jackson's lack of government
experience and his foreign policy views, and said the nation needs
a ``president, not a preacher.''
   Jackson's mild rejoinder on Sunday: ``Well, both of us went to
seminary.''
   Asked if Gore's remarks had been unfair, Jackson said, ``No, I
think that Al Gore has too much character to be categorically
unfair.''
   Gore, for his part, praised Jackson for saying he wouldn't sit
down with Arafat.
   ``The statement Jesse Jackson made this morning was very
constructive. That's a change in his position, I believe,'' the
Tennessee senator said as he campaigned in Brooklyn.
   Gore, appearing in heavily Jewish neighborhoods, picked up the
endorsement of state Assemblyman Dov Hikind. At one stop, Hikind
introduced Gore by denouncing Jackson as the candidate who
``embraced Yasser Arafat'' and saying that Gore was the only one
who ``had the courage'' to criticize Jackson.
   But when he spoke, Gore didn't discuss Jackson.
   Gore, also interviewed on the CBS program, said he did not
intend to change his campaign style despite criticism from
Democratic heavyweights like party chief Paul Kirk and New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo over attacks on the other Democrats.
   ``I have no plans to change my basic campaign posture at all,''
he said.
   Democratic non-candidate Cuomo, meanwhile, offered a confusing
succession of statements on whether he would accept a draft from a
deadlocked convention.
   On Saturday, during a telelphone interview with The Associated
Press, he declared: ``I've ruled it out.''
   Cuomo's press secretary, Gary Fryer, immediately denied that the
governor had intended to say he would refuse a draft, and meant
instead that a draft should not take place.
   On Sunday, Cuomo told the AP: ``I think it is absolutely a
reasonable interpretation to say that if a person says it's wrong,
it's counterproductive, it's unwise, it shouldn't be, then that
means he rejects a draft.''
   But when asked flatly if the correct interpretation was that he
would not accept a draft, Cuomo said, ``I think so.''
   He was more direct when asked much the same question by The New
York Times on Sunday.
   ``Yes. You're absolutely correct. That's accurate. Now I hope
there are no questions left about my role,'' the Times quoted him
as saying.
   Kirk, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said Sunday
that the fight for the nomination will help the Democrats by
keeping the party's candidates in the spotlight _ unlike the
Republican race, where the suspense is gone.
   Bush himself acknowledged that.
   ``I've got to look more frantic,'' he joked to reporters
traveling with him on Air Force Two over the weekend as he returned
from a round of fund-raisers _ his last of the primary campaign.
``I think we've just got to recognize ... we're not going to get
the intensive political coverage.''
   Meanwhile, Richard Nixon predicted Bush will win the general
election in November, but that the Democratic nominee will give him
a run for his money.
   The former president was asked on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press''
whether Dukakis was too dull to be an effective nominee.
   ``I've often said ... that the best politics is poetry rather
than prose,'' Nixon replied. ``Jesse Jackson is a poet, Cuomo is a
poet, and Dukakis is a word processor _ that's what it gets down
to.'
   ``On the other hand,'' Nixon said of Dukakis, ``he's cool, he's
intelligent, he's tough, he's good in debates. He's going to be a
very formidable candidate.''

   Israel today deported eight more Palestinians
to Lebanon, saying they incited anti-Israeli protests. Leaders of
the four-month uprising in the occupied lands called for a ``day of
firebombing'' later this month.
   The army said five of those deported today were from the Gaza
Strip and three from the West Bank.
   Israel deported four West Bank Palestinians on Jan. 13, sparking
protests of the action as a violation of the Geneva Conventions
governing the treatment of citizens in occupied zones.
   The army said deportation orders had been issued for 12 other
Palestinians from the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967
Middle East War. The Palestinians ordered deported may appeal.
   Israel has deported more than 1,000 Palestinians since 1967.
   Six of the 12 ordered deported are from Beita, the site of a
clash between Israeli teen-agers and Palestinians. Two Arabs and an
Israeli girl died in the melee.
   Also today, Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip shuttered
their stores and stayed home from jobs in Israel under PLO orders.
   The army, meanwhile, promised the Supreme Court it would give 48
hours notice before destroying more homes in Beita.
   An army statement said the eight Palestinians who were deported
to Lebanon today were ``leading organizers and instigators of the
recent violent public disturbances'' in the occupied territories.
   The statement said those from Beita who were slated for
expulsion had played ``an active part in the attack'' on the
Israeli teen-agers, who were on a hiking expedition.
   The army says it has destroyed 13 houses of villagers accused of
inciting the clash. Villagers claimed 23 houses hadbeen knocked
down.
   The latest underground leaflet circulated in the occupied lands
praised Beita for ``showing settlers a lesson'' during the incident
and called on Palestinians to raise money for ``the heroic
village.'' As before, the leaflet was signed by the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The leaflet also congratulated Palestinians for refusing to meet
with Secretary of State George P. Shultz during his Middle East
tour. ``Your uprising stopped Shultz from his fake plan, and he
went back to his country as a big failure, without any of our
people having met him,'' the leaflet said.
   Business came to a virtual standstill in towns and cities in the
West Bank and Gaza today as residents observed a commercial strike.
   In Bethlehem, the central market was closed and tourist shops
lining Manger Square were shuttered. No Arab taxis or buses were
operating into or out of the town where Christians believe Jesus
was born.
   A complete strike was also observed in Gaza City and the rest of
the coastal strip, Palestinian reporters there said. Nablus
residents reported all stores in the city were closed, as were
businesses in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Residents of Bethlehem, Nablus and Gaza City said more than half
of the Arab workers who normally travel to jobs in Israel stayed
home.
   The latest leaflet called for further commercial strikes on
Thursday and Saturday and for more days of protest honoring Arabs
killed in the last four months. Israeli troops or settlers have
killed 141 Palestinans since violence broke out Dec. 8, according
to U.N. figures. One Israeli soldier and one civilian have been
killed during that time.
   The leaflet called for a ``Palestine Molotov Day,'' referring to
the Molotov cocktails, or firebombs, often thrown by rioters at
Israeli targets.
   ``(The day) is Palestine Molotov Day, as an answer to the
authorities position to give settlers the right to shoot at any
Molotov throwers.'' The leaflet designated April 21 as ``Palestine
Molotov Day'' and called for a general strike the same day.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was quoted last month as saying
Israeli civilians could shoot at firebomb throwers if they had no
other way to extricate themselves from a life-threatening situation.
   The leaflet also told Palestinians to boycott Israeli products,
especially during the monthlong Moslem holiday of Ramadan, which
begins next weekend.
   Debate continued today over the clash in Beita.
   In a Supreme Court hearing on an appeal brought by the Israeli
Civil Rights Association, officials promised to give 48 hours
notice before destroying any more homes in Beita and to give
villagers ``a reasonable amount of time'' to appeal.
   Nili Arad, a state prosecutor, said the army had no immediate
plans to destroy more homes in Beita. But she stressed that the
army probe of the clash was not over and might turn up more
suspected inciters.
   Ms. Arad said army policy was to provide a warning before
demolitions unless an incident was considered ``particularly
grave.'' She said the Beita clash fell into that category.
   The army is expected within a few days to release its findings
on the Beita clash.
   On Sunday, Jewish settlers and right-wing legislators criticized
the army for saying Tirza Porat, 15, had been accidentally killed
by a shot from a gun carried by a Jewish settler who was guarding
the teen-age hikers. They insisted she was shot by an Arab that
some saw pointing a rifle from a rooftop.
   Rabin told a weekly Cabinet session Sunday that an army autopsy
showed Miss Porat was apparently struck by a bullet from the M-16
rifle of Romem Al Dubi, one of two settler guards who accompanied
the teens on their hike near Beita.

   Martin E. Citrin, a close friend of Henry
Ford II and the only non-family executor of Ford's estate, has died
of a self-inflicted gunshot at the age of 59, police said.
   Citrin's body was found Saturday at a motel in Romulus, west of
Detroit, police and Wayne County Medical Examiner Werner Spitz
said. The Bloomfield Hills businessman and Jewish community leader
checked into the motel Thursday.
   Police and Citrin's brother, Toby, offered no reasons for the
death.
   Citrin was an executor of Henry Ford II's estate along with
Ford's widow, Kathy DuRoss Ford, and Ford's son, Edsel Ford II, who
declined comment. Edsel Ford has served as family spokesman since
his father's death in September.
   In addition to family oil interests, in 1984, Citrin and his
brother founded Ways and Means, a company that supplies health care
products for the elderly and handicapped. Citrin was a child polio
victim and needed crutches to walk.
   Survivors include Citrin's mother, Matilda Citrin; his wife,
Myra; two daughters, two sons and a grandson.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in a
letter to President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica that the Soviet
government was prepared to stop sending arms to Central America if
the United States agreed to do the same.
   In the letter, the Soviet Communist Party general secretary also
said he had proposed to the United States to embargo all arms
shipments to the region, except for firearms for police forces.
   The Soviet Union is a major arms supplier to Nicaragua's
Sandinista government.
   Reports that the Soviet Union was sending arms to leftist
Salvadoran and Guatemalan guerrillas were ``totally unfounded,''
said the letter, which was made public Saturday by Arias' press
office.
   Gorbachev said his government was conducting its relations with
Central America's governments in accordance with the regional peace
plan authored by Arias and signed by the five Central American
presidents on Aug. 7.
   That plan calls for an end to outside assistance for
insurgencies in the region, cease-fires in Nicaragua, El Salvador,
and Guatemala, and talks aimed at establishing democratic elections
in the region.
   ``The Soviet Union is ready to assume, on a reciprocal basis
with the United States, the obligation to respect and rigorously
comply with the accords relative to conditions of security, the
control and limitation of arms,'' the letter said.
   Gorbachev was responding to a letter Arias sent on March 7
asking the Soviet leader to suspend arms shipments to the region.
   Arias has urged Gorbachev and President Reagan to include
Central America as a topic in their next summit meeting, scheduled
for May.
   Gorbachev said the two superpowers had yet to agree to stop
sending arms because ``the United States neither pursues nor wants
to hear talk of any reduction in U.S. arms shipments to Honduras
and El Salvador.''
   The Honduran and Salvadoran governments are the Reagan
administration's principal allies in Central America.

   FBI Director William S. Sessions told Senate
hearings on organized crime today that law enforcement efforts have
seriously damaged, but not destroyed, the nation's organized crime
families.
   Testifying at the most extensive Senate hearings on organized
crime in nearly 25 years, Sessions said the FBI's extensive
intelligence system indicates that many organized crime enterprises
``which have existed unfettered for years have been dismantled.''
   Sessions told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations that the secrecy of the criminal underworld ``has
been co-opted'' by the cooperation of organized crime figures with
the FBI.
   ``Most importantly, their ability to influence and intimidate
the business and political community is weakened,'' Sessions said.
   The hearings were held amid stringent security measures, with a
metal detector set up outside the hearing room. Inside the room
were charts listing organized crime families of today and the
charts used in 1963, when convicted murderer Joseph Valachi,
appearing before the same panel, introduced the phrase ``La Cosa
Nostra'' into the national consciousness.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., opening the new hearing, said the crime
family ``soldiers'' listed in the charts from the Valachi hearings
``appear today among the highest-ranking powers in the LCN (La Cosa
Nostra) families.''
   Sessions, the leadoff witness, told the subcommittee, ``The
question most often asked is whether we have eradicated the LCN as
a national threat. The simple answer is no. They continue to engage
in a wide variety of criminal activities. ...''
   Valachi was the star witness in the widely publicized 1963
Senate investigation of organized crime, unfolding a complex story
of murder, terror, crime and vice. He described the La Cosa Nostra
organization and named alleged members.
   Tommaso Buscetta, described as a former member of the Porto
Nuova Sicilian Mafia family in Palermo, Sicily, was scheduled to
testify after Sessions.
   The subcommittee has set four days of hearings this month _
today, Friday, April 21 and April 22. Angelo Lonardo, described as
the former boss of the Cleveland La Cosa Nostra family, leads off
Friday's hearings.
   In the 1963 hearings, the 58-year-old Valachi, who was serving a
life sentence in the Atlanta federal penitentiary, said La Cosa
Nostra was a highly organized unit with a strict code guaranteed by
blood ties and arranged marriages within the tight framework of the
crime syndicate.
   He testified that the organization had been responsible for many
gangland deaths throughout the country, including the slayings of
mobsters Albert Anastasi and Frank Scalise.
   FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover called the Valachi case ``the
biggest intelligence breakthrough yet in combating organized crime
and racketeering in the United States.''
   Attorney General Robert P. Kennedy said federal authorities had
``full confidence'' in Valachi's testimony and called for
comprehensive legislation to deal with organized crime, including
new federal wiretapping powers and immunity for witnesses in
racketeering probes.
   In announcing the new hearings, the panel's chairman, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., said, ``In the wake of an impressive array of
successful prosecutions, it is important that we take stock and
assess just how far we have come in the war against organized
crime.''
   ``Some have described the recent prosecutions of mob hierarchies
as the final death knell of La Cosa Nostra,'' he said. ``Others
argue that these prosecutions merely remove one mob hierarchy and
replace it with another _ as powerful and sometimes even more
vicious than the old.''
   Nunn said the subcommittee, as it did 25 years ago, will hear
from witnesses who will describe how organized crime has survived
despite periodically successful attacks by law enforcement agencies.
   ``These hearings will not only try to determine if any
additional law enforcement legislation is needed, but also whether
the federal government is effectively using these tools that have
already been provided to them,'' Nunn said. ``In particular, we are
interested in reviewing the recent successful civil and criminal
prosecutions under the 1970 racketeering statutes.
   ``Not only will we be interested in the impact of those recent
successes but also the ability to transfer such tactics to other
areas of organized criminal activity _ particularly to the fields
of labor racketeering, narcotics trafficking and other emerging
organized crime groups,'' he said.
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Republican on
the subcommittee, said occasional successes in battling organized
crime should not lead to complacency.
   ``These secret criminal societies recognize only the law of the
jungle and respect only the wealth of ill-gotten gain,'' Roth said.
``We must recognize the new face of organized crime in this
country. It is important that we take this opportunity to examine
whether the strategies we've successfully used in the past will be
effective in the future.''

<TEXT>
   A man accused in the torture-murder of
a nurse was still at large today after he drove off in a prisoner
van when his guards went into a convenience store and left the keys
behind.
   Police used helicopters and dogs to search for Richard Lacy
Letner Jr., 27, after the Sunday escape.
   ``He should be considered extremely dangerous,'' said police
Sgt. Jim Nelson of Visalia, Calif. Letner was being taken from Iowa
to California to stand trial for the March 1 strangulation and
stabbing of Ivon Portbriant, Nelson said.
   Letner and eight other prisoners were in a van owned by
Interstate Extraditions of Bloomington, Ill., a private company
that uses former law officers to transport 3,000 prisoners across
the nation each year.
   Jim Kuzek, a spokesman for Interstate Extraditions, said the van
went to Texas to pick-up more prisoners, and was en route to Silver
City, N.M., before going to California. The
   The driver and another guard left the keys in the van when they
stopped at the convenience store.
   After kicking out a rear window, Letner got into the driver's
seat and drove the van about a block before using other keys to
unlock his handcuffs and shackles. He then abandoned the van and
fled on foot, said San Antonio police spokeswoman Sandy Perez.
   None of the other prisoners left the van, she said.
   Ms. Portbriant was found dead in her apartment with a telephone
cord wrapped around her neck, Nelson said. ``She had been stabbed
several times. She was tortured and then murdered.''
   Letner and another suspect were found in Ms. Portbriant's car
that night. The car was impounded but police let the men go free
before they learned of the murder. Both men were arrested in
Council Bluffs, Iowa, Nelson said.
   Kuzek of Interstate Extraditions said the guards violated
company policy by leaving the keys in the ignition. Together, the
guards have a total of 20 years of law enforcement experience, he
said.

<TEXT>
   The owner of two Indian elephants says
he'll agree to sell the 3{-ton animals if their former owner, who
apparently has been hiding the pachyderms for four years, will
return them.
   Richard Drake, owner of a now-closed Tehachapi, Calif., animal
farm, said Sunday he wants to get fair market value for the
27-year-old female elephants, appraised at $70,000 apiece.
   Drake said he has spent ``thousands and thousands of dollars''
crisscrossing the country searching for Arlan Seidon, the man who
fled with the elephants, Tory and Duchess.
   Seidon, who raised the elphants from infancy, contacted The Star
Ledger of Newark several weeks ago from an undisclosed location and
said he would return to face charges of third-degree theft if the
elephants were not given to Drake.
   Seidon sold the elephants to the Drakes for $80,000 in 1981 but
said he repossessed the animals for non-payment. The Drakes
successfully fought the action and in May 1984 Superior Court Judge
Peter Thomas awarded them $107,000 in damages.
   Seidon also charged that Drake, 50, and his son, Edward, 30,
abused the animals. The Drakes deny that charge.
   Seidon, 58, fled with the elephants from a farm in Colts Neck
Township while the animals were with a circus in New Jersey. He has
been on the lam ever since.
   ``It's been at a standstill for four years,'' Drake said from
his sister's Far Hills home. ``We have to do something.''
   Drake said Sunday he had contacted Seidon's attorney, Isabelle
Strauss of East Orange, and was awaiting an answer to his proposal.
   Ms. Strauss, an animal activist, was not in her office today for
additional comment, a secretary said.
   She told The Star Ledger on Saturday that Seidon, who phones her
periodically, would not allow the elephants to go to animal brokers
who would sell them to other people.
   Ms. Strauss said a Vermont businessman is interested in the
animals and that she is trying to work out a deal.
   Ms. Strauss has said she does not know where or how Seidon has
been concealing the elephants.
   Seidon has said he left his farm at Fordland, Mo., and his
career preparing animals for circus and television appearances to
care for the elephants, which eat about 200 pounds off hay a day.
He said he hasn't seen his four children or met his only grandson
since he took off with the animals.

<HEAD>Briton Descended from Stuarts Picked to Lead Catholic Order</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS formal title in 11th graf pvs ``Andrew
Willoughby...''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A descendant of Britain's royal Stuart family was
elected leader of the Knights of Malta, an ancient Roman Catholic
charitable order, it was announced today.
   Fra Andrew Bertie was voted grand master at a secret conclave of
36 electors Friday at the group's villa in Rome. His election makes
him the highest-ranking layman in the Catholic church.
   The order, founded with a pilgrims' hospice in 11th century
Jerusalem, has the status of an independent state. It maintains
diplomatic relations with 50 nations.
   Its 10,000 members, led by Italy with 2,800 and the United
States with 2,500, operate about 200 hospitals and first-aid
centers in 90 countries, especially in the Third World and war
zones.
   The announcement of Bertie's election was delayed for approval
by Pope John Paul II.
   Bertie was one of 22 eligible candidates at the conclave. The
electors from the group's Council Complete of State voted by secret
ballot, and no tally was announced.
   Other council members are presidents of the order's worldwide
associations, including New York financier J. Peter Grace.
   Bertie, 58, is the knights' 78th grand master, or supreme
leader. He succeeds Fra Angelo de Mojana di Cologna, an 82-year-old
Italian who died Jan. 18 after 25 years as grand master.
   Officially known as the Sovereign Military Order of the Hospital
of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, the group only
selects as grand master people who have followed vows of poverty,
obedience and chastity. They must also have 200 years of nobility
on both parents' sides.
   Elected for life, the grand master carries the title of prince
and ``most eminent highness.'' The position is equal in rank to a
cardinal.
   Andrew Willoughby Ninian Bertie of the Earls of Lindsey and
Abingdon _ his full title _ was born in London on May 15, 1929,
according to the order's statement.
   His father, James, worked as foreign exchange dealer at the
stock exchange there.
   His mother, Lady Jean Crichton-Stuart, was a descendant of the
Stuarts, the ruling family of Scotland from 1371-1603 and of
England and Scotland from 1603-1714, with an 11-year interruption
in the 17th century. Bertie's aunt on his mother's side was married
to the brother of Sir Winston Churchill.
   As a youth, Bertie studied at a Benedectine boarding school in
Ampleforth. He earned a degree in modern history at Christ Church
College of Oxford.
   For more than 20 years, he taught French, Spanish and Russian at
a Benedictine school in Worth in southern England.
   He joined the knights in 1956 and took his vows his 1981.

   Jury selection began with tight security
today at the trial of a southwest Missouri dairy farmer accused of
killing seven members of his family in a fall shooting spree.
   James E. Schnick, 36, of nearby Elkland, faces seven counts of
first-degree murder in the deaths of his wife and her brother and
his family on Sept. 25.
   Immediately after the killings, police had speculated that one
of the victims, a 14-year-old boy, was responsible.
   Highway Patrol officers helped Webster County deputies search
the courtroom and inspect each spectator with a metal detector
before proceedings began.
   Sheriff Eugene Fraker said the security measures were taken as a
precaution and not because of any threats.
   Schnick sat quietly between his two attorneys. His hands were
clenched tightly but unshackled. He began to cry quietly when the
judge read the charges against him to the potential jurors.
   More than 100 prospective jurors were scheduled to be
interviewed today.
   The courthouse is a short drive from the scene of the slayings
at two family dairy farms in the tiny community of Elkland.
   Proceedings are likely to center on what prosecutor Donald
Cheever says is Schnick's confession.
   According to statements made in a pre-trial hearing in February,
Schnick implicated himself Oct. 5 at Missouri State Highway Patrol
troop headquarters in Springfield, where, as the only witness in
the slayings, he had been taken to undergo a lie detector test.
   Schnick's attorneys, county public defender James McNabb and
special state public defender Susan Chapman, had attempted to have
Schnick's statements suppressed. They said the statements were
unfairly obtained by a Webster County sheriff's deputy who
exploited both his friendship with Schnick and the suspect's
fragile mental and physical condition.
   Circuit Judge John Parrish ruled that the confession was
admissable.
   Schnick is accused of shooting his wife Julie, 30; her brother
Steve Buckner, 35; Buckner's wife Jeannette, 36; and the Buckner's
four children: Kirk, 14; Dennis, 8; Timmy, 6; and Michael, 2. The
Schnicks' two young children were not injured.
   Authorities initially speculated that Kirk was responsible.
Schnick, who suffered minor wounds that morning, told officers that
he and his family had been attacked by an unknown intruder.
   Kirk was found with the gun used in the killings in his right
hand, but authorities later discovered he was left-handed.

   Black students boycotted classes today at
Denison University to protest what they call lenient treatment of
white students involved in a racial incident, and about 400
students and faculty members attended a rally.
   University spokesman Stewart Dyke said the rally was peaceful
and included a speech by university trustee Clifford Tyree, who
said he would recommend the institution adopt a policy of immediate
suspension from school for racial harassment.
   ``They're really using it as an educational opportunity to
address the issues and incidents of racism that they've seen on the
increase,'' Dyke said of the rally. ``They're putting it into the
context of the new racism on campuses these days.''
   The protest resulted from an incident last week. Two students
accused of verbally harassing Aaron Laramore, a black senior from
Toledo who is head resident at the private school's Huffman Hall
dormitory, were suspended for one semester Friday by the University
Judicial Board. A third white student was found innocent.
   About 80 of 2,100 undergraduates at the school in a suburb of
Columbus are black, Dyke said.
   The white students, who lived in a room adjacent to Laramore's,
testified that they were having a private conversation early on the
morning of April 1. But the Black Student Union claimed the racial
slurs were aimed at Laramore.
   Dyke refused to identify the students, citing Denison's privacy
policy.
   The Black Student Union said it was ``profoundly disappointed at
the shortsighted, insensitive and totally unsatisfactory decision
by the board.''
   Steve Gaskill, a sophomore and member of the Black Student
Union, said the group met before the hearing and agreed not to
accept any punshisment less than a year-long suspension for the
students found guilty.
   ``I don't expect an end,'' he said regarding the protest. ``I do
expect an impact on the students to end apathy about racism on
campus.''

<TEXT>
   Arab hijackers of a Kuwait Airways jet
killed a hostage today, then said they will shoot all the
passengers, including three members of Kuwait's royal family, if
the plane is not refueled.
   The gunmen said the dead man, who was tossed out of the plane
onto the tarmac, was a ``Kuwaiti officer.'' He was the second man
killed by the hijackers, who hold nearly 50 people aboard the plane.
   Doctors said the side of the man's face was badly injured,
possibly because of a beating. He had been shot at least once in
the head.
   The hijackers warned they would take ``more dangerous steps'' if
their demand for fuel was not met by Cypriot officials. They said
they wanted to fly to a ``neutral country.''
   More than three hours after the man's body was thrown out of the
plane at Larnaca airport, the hijackers put one of the passengers,
identified as Fadl Marzouk el-Oteibi, on the radio.
   Speaking in Arabic, he told the control tower: ``The hijackers
say that if you don't give us fuel they will kill all the
passengers.
   ``Please listen to this and greetings to my family.''
   The man's body was was thrown out of the jet at 3:07 p.m. (8:07
a.m. EDT), after Cypriot authorities did not comply with several
demands that the aircraft be refueled.
   Half an hour later an ambulance headed toward the plane, picked
up the body and took it to the Larnaca morgue, where AP photo
stringer Takis Ioannides said the man was dead on arrival.
   ``We have executed a Kuwaiti officer,'' a hijacker told the
control tower. ``We also reconfirm that the craft must be refueled
immediately, immediately, before we take more dangerous steps.''
   Kuwaiti officials had said three people with ``military status''
were on the plane.
   One of them, a 24-year-old Kuwaiti border guard, was killed
Saturday in the first death in the weeklong ordeal.
   The hijackers had set two deadlines today for fuel. A 1 p.m. (6
a.m.) deadline passed without incident after Malaz Abdo, deputy
head of the Palestine Liberation Organization office here, and
Michael Herodotou, head of Cyprus' Civil Aviation Department,
conducted brief negotiations with the hijackers.
   The hijackers then set a 2:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. EDT) deadline and
told the control tower refueling must start or ``you will receive
the corpse.''
   Fourty-seven minutes later, the man, identified by the hijackers
as a Kuwaiti officer, was thrown out of the jet.
   In announcing the first deadline today, one of the gunmen told
the control tower by radio: ``We hereby appeal to the Cyprus
government that we are intending to take off to a neutral country,
therefore you are kindly requested within one hour to start
refueling the craft. Otherwise, we kill a personality related to
the unjust Kuwaiti regime.''
   The hijackers have been demanding the release of 17 terrorists
held in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies there in
1983. But sources close to the negotiations said the hijackers
today demanded freedom for the three men among the 17 terrorists
who are sentenced to death.
   Kuwait apparently rejected the modified demand.
   On Sunday, a pro-Iranian group in Lebanon threatened to kill
American and French hostages if any attempt was made to storm the
plane. A statement from the Islamic Jihad terrorist group was
delivered to a news agency in west Beirut, along with photographs
of journalists Terry A. Anderson, an American, and Jean-Paul
Kauffmann, of France.
   Three members of Kuwait's large Al-Sabah royal family are among
the 52 people believed to be aboard the Boeing 747, including at
least half a dozen hooded hijackers armed with grenades and guns.
   The plane was hijacked Tuesday on a flight from Bangkok to
Kuwait carrying 112 people and forced down in northeastern Iran,
where 57 people were freed. After the plane left Iran on Friday,
Beirut and Damascus refused to let it land.
   Another captive, an ailing 32-year-old Kuwaiti, was freed in
Larnaca, apparently after PLO intervention.
   One member of the royal family, Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, told the
tower by radio Sunday evening in a faint voice: ``We depend on God
for our fate.'' The other two royal family members are his sisters,
Ebtesam and Anware.
   Today marked the first time the hijackers had referred over the
radio to any plan to fly to a ``neutral country.'' They did not
name the country or say which of the royal family they planned to
kill.
   However, the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas reported that Algerian
officials have become involved in the negotiations.
   At one point, the gunmen had threatened to take off and force
the pilot to crash the jumbo jet into the emir's palace in Kuwait
City.
   On Sunday, the hijackers threatened to start a ``slow and quiet
massacre'' of the 47 or so remaining hostages unless Kuwait
released the pro-Iranian prisoners in Kuwait.
   The PLO is believed to be a key factor in the negotiations. On
Sunday, PLO chief Yasser Arafat joined other Moslem leaders meeting
on other issues in Kuwait in supporting Kuwait's refusal to give in
to the hijackers' demands.
   In Kuwait, pro-government newspapers reported today that
additional gunmen boarded the hijacked jetliner at Iran's Mashhad
airport and arms and ammunition also were supplied.
   Government statements have blamed Iran for the fate of the
hostages because Iran allowed the plane to leave Mashhad.
   Iran has denied involvement in the hijacking.

   Authorities on Monday ordered all cats
and dogs leashed in order to stop an outbreak of rabies.
   The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry imposed the order after
a fox and dog died of rabies in the southeastern corner of Finland.
Officials believe the rabies came from the Soviet Union, which
shares a nearby border.
   Authorities also asked hunters in the area to concentrate on
killing foxes, raccoons and badgers, as well as stray dogs and cats.
   Household pets can come down with the viral disease through
contact with infected animals. People can be infected with rabies
through animal bites.
   There were no reports of human cases in the outbreak.

<HEAD>Movie Critic Rex Reed In Police Court For Attempted State Tax
Evasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Movie critic Rex Reed pleaded guilty today
to attempted state tax evasion charges in a dispute he blamed on a
former accountant's advice.
   In an agreement with the state Attorney General's office, Reed
already had paid approximately $20,000 to the state Department of
Taxation and Finance to cover deliquent taxes, penalties and
interest.
   `It's ironic that this would happen on Academy Awards day,'' he
said outside the court, adding that he didn't believe he would be
able to get a flight to Los Angeles in time for the awards.
   ``I'm going to miss seeing Cher's navel,'' he said. Cher was his
pick for best actress in the film ``Moonstruck.''
   Appearing in City Police Court, Reed, 49, entered a guilty plea
on two misdemeanor counts of attempted tax evasion for failing to
file state returns in 1984 and 1985 while employed as a columnist
for the New York Post. He was fined $2,000.
   The Tax Department found that the Post paid Reed as an
independent contractor for 1984 and 1985, ``therefore he was
earning income from a New York state employer, but had not filed
the New York state returns,'' said Nancy Connell, a spokeswoman for
the Attorney General's office.
   Reed told reporters that since he lives in Connecticut he should
have filed nonresident tax forms but said an accountant he no
longer retains told him that wasn't necessary.
   State tax officials said Reed's primary address is New York City.
   Reed was a columnist for the Daily News in New York City for 12
years, then worked for the Post from 1982 until last year. He
currently appears on the syndicated television series ``At The
Movies.''

   A police raid on suspected drug
dealers was conducted weeks ahead of schedule because a network
television crew planned to show the suspects in a nationally
televised documentary, officials said.
   The weekend sting resulted in 29 arrests, but one West Virginia
state trooper suffered a gunshot wound and two others were injured
in a traffic accident.
   The alleged dealings near a shopping center were covered in just
25 seconds of Sunday night's hourlong ABC-TV documentary titled
``Drugs: A Plague Upon the Land.''
   U.S. Attorney William Kolibash, who originally was concerned
that if the suspects saw themselves on TV they would flee, said
after the show aired that the influence probably would have been
minimal.
   ``These people were so blatant that they probably would have
been back out there within a week,'' Kolibash said.
   Saturday's raid focused on runners peddling crack cocaine
shipped in from Miami, and Washington, D.C., by Jamaican dealers,
Kolibash said.
   The suspects were using the rural county to cater to out-of-town
buyers who ``didn't want to have to worry about the dangers'' of
city crime, he said. The county is less than an hour's drive from
suburban Washington.
   About 60 state and federal agents Saturday afternoon began
serving arrest warrants on 40 people accused of distributing crack.
A total of 29 arrests have been made, authorities said today, and
more are pending.
   A national magazine article several weeks ago detailed a
Jamaican drug connection to Jefferson County, and a television crew
arrived shortly thereafter.
   Kolibash said he offered to let the reporters do their work from
unmarked police vehicles, but also asked that their pictures not be
aired until the suspects were arrested.
   ``We were kind of concerned that if some of those people saw
themselves on television, they would disappear,'' Kolibash said.
   ABC News officials didn't hold off, however, and scheduled the
special show for Sunday night, Kolibash said.
   ABC News spokeswoman Joyce Kravitz denied that the network was
responsible for speeding up the drug arrests.
   ``My understanding is that they offered to move the date,'' she
said. ``They volunteered to do that. It wasn't anything we asked
for.''

   A five-man bomb disposal team from the Navy
has been sent to Islamabad, Pakistan, in the wake of Sunday's
massive blast at an ammunition depot, the Pentagon said today.
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said the team
was flown from an aircraft carrier battle group operating in the
northern Arabian Sea on Sunday at the request of the U.S.
ambassador.
   Schneider said the government of Pakistan had made no request
for assistance. The explosives experts will be on call ``in the
event that unexploded ordnance is found in U.S. compounds,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``This was a prudent precautionary measure,'' he added. ``They
were sent at the request of the American ambassador to render any
assistance required by the U.S. country team (in Pakistan).''
   The Sunday explosion sent projectiles into populated areas in
and around Pakistan's capital, killing at least 93 people and
wounding more than 1,000.

<HEAD>Historian Convicted in Stolen Documents Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scholar was convicted today of transporting
stolen historic documents, including letters from Abraham Lincoln
and Winston Churchill, that belonged to the National Archives and
the Library of Congress.
   Charles Merrill Mount, 59, was charged with interstate
transportation of stolen goods. He faces up to 10 years in prison
and a $500,000 fine when sentenced May 23.
   The jury deliberated four hours Friday and met for about 2{
hours more today before returning the verdict.
   Mount, a respected biographer and former Guggenheim Foundation
fellow, insisted the documents he sold to a bookshop were his.
   Mount's public defender, Charles McGinty, said bookkeeping at
the National Archives and Library of Congress was too spotty to
prove those institutions ever owned the documents in question.
   Mount was not charged with theft, although the government
contended that he took the papers.
   In closing arguments Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Martin
Murphy reiterated the government's claim that Mount stole the
papers and removed their identifying marks.
   Mount was accused of selling to a Boston bookshop letters
written by artist James McNeill Whistler, Churchill and author
Henry James that belonged to the Library of Congress. He was
arrested while trying to sell letters and papers signed by Abraham
Lincoln and some Civil War generals that allegedly were taken from
the National Archives.
   Mount, who was born Sherman Suchow, claimed he bought the
Whistler papers at Paris shops in the 1950s and '60s, and that a
priest in Ireland, who has since died, gave him the Civil War
papers in 1961.
   Mount, who favors a gray bowler hat, a British accent he
attributes to neighbors in Brooklyn and dapper suits from the
Salvation Army, said he was impoverished after the government
seized his savings.
   During most of the trial he lodged at a YMCA.
   The defense noted that Mount over the years donated many of his
papers to the Library of Congress. He has written biographies of
painters John Singer Sargent, Gilbert Stuart and Claude Monet, and
held a Guggenheim fellowship in 1956.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Monday
that 150,000 Iranian pilgrims would travel to Mecca this year and
stage demonstrations against the United States and Israel.
   These intentions had been announced earlier this year by other
Iranian officials but it was the first time that Iran's 87-year-old
spiritual leader has referred to them.
   Saudi Arabia has said it will cut the number of pilgrims
traveling to the holy city this year but has not announced any
figures.
   Last year 402 pilgrims, including 275 Iranians, were killed in
riots that began with a rally against ``pagans'' in the holy city
in Saudi Arabia during the hajj, or pilgrimage.
   Saudi officials said many pilgrims were trampled to death in a
stampede or killed in subsequent street brawls that followed the
demonstration. Iran claimed police mowed down the pilgrims with
machine guns.
   After the violence last summer, Iran called for the overthrow of
the ruling family in Saudi Arabia, saying it was unfit to have
custody of Mecca and Medina, holy places of Islam.
   ``This year 150,000 pilgrims will participate in hajj rituals
and the pilgrims will do their duty, which is disowning the
infidels, America and Israel,'' Khomeini was quoted as saying by
Tehran radio, which was monitored in Nicosia.
   ``It is not possible for our pilgrims to take part in the hajj
and not demonstrate against world arrogance,'' Khomeini said.
``Basically, disowning the infidels is one of the political duties
of pilgrims, and without it the hajj would not be the hajj.''

   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings received public
television's highest honor Monday for being ``a longtime champion
of public broadcasting.''
   Hollings, D-S.C., was to be presented with the 1988 Ralph Lowell
Award during a meeting Monday night of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, a private, non-profit corporation that develops
non-commercial radio and television services.
   When he was governor of South Carolina from 1959 to 1963,
Hollings was instrumental in creating the public TV system in his
state. Last year, together with Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, he
proposed a trust fund to create a permanent financial base for
public broadcasting.

   President Reagan's spokesman acknowledged
today that U.S. steps inentded to force Panamanian strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega from power have seriously damaged that
nation's financial system, but expressed optimism Panama's economy
will recover.
   ``We don't think it is irreparable harm, but it is serious
harm,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   He was queried about concerns expressed by leading Panamanians
that the past several weeks of financial turmoil triggered by U.S.
attempts to pressure Noriega to step down have caused permanent
damage to the country's once-flourishing financial system.
   Fitzwater contended that the U.S. steps, which included freezing
Panamanian assets in the United States, have been effective, even
though Noriega has not yet stepped down. The spokesman also
contended that the U.S. government has not intended to harm the
general population.
   ``They (the sanctions) were designed to strangle the financial
system,'' Fitzwater said.
   Noriega is under indictment in Florida for alleged drug
trafficking and U.S. officials have insisted that he relinquish
power and leave the country.
   In an effort to increase pressure on Noriega, Reagan on Friday
invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for the
first time since invoking it against Libya two years ago. That
action banned all trade with Libya.
   The law prohibits payments _ including taxes _ by Americans and
U.S. corporations to the Panamanian government. One administration
official estimated last week that roughly 40 to 50 subsidiaries of
U.S. corporations would be affected.
   Fitzwater defended the steps as attempting ``to deny Noriega ...
money that could be used to perpetuate his stay in power.''
   ``We have tried to design those sanctions to affect the banking
and financial system of the country and not the general economy ...
and tried to minimize damage to the general public and general
economy while at the same time attacking the points of power that
constitute the base for Noriega staying in there,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``There is serious damage being done, in terms of the financial
system, but we think the banking system will be able to recover,''
he added.
   Earlier, Treasury Secretary James Baker said he's optimistic
that the new economic sanctions will force Noriega from power
without permanently damaging the economy.
   ``We worry about the Panamanian economy because what we've tried
to do is take action that would not hurt the Panamanian people,''
Baker said in an interview on the NBC-TV ``Today'' program.
   ``We've tried to take action directed toward getting Noriega to
step down,'' added Baker.
   Asked if the administration is considering even sterner moves to
force Noriega from power, Baker said he believes the new sanctions
``will be effective.''
   ``I think for the time being this is what should be done and
we're optimistic about the results,'' said the Treasury secretary.
   Panamanian assets in U.S. banks have been frozen since March,
when Reagan requested the Federal Reserve take the action after
deposed Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle obtained an
injunction from a federal court in Miami.
   Reagan's executive order on Friday stopped short of a full
economic embargo on Panama, but violators can be prosecuted for
non-compliance with administration policy for the first time since
U.S.-Panama relations began to sour. Violators can be sentenced to
up to 10 years in prison and $50,000 in fines.

<HEAD>Singer of `Rainy Night in Georgia' Dies at 56</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with two grafs to CORRECT cause of death</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brook Benton, whose stylish touch with pop
ballads led to hit songs in three decades, including ``Rainy Night
in Georgia,'' has died. He was 56.
   Benton died Saturday at Mary Immaculate Hospital. His managers
said today that he died of bacterial meningitis.
   His elegant baritone, backed by sweeping string arrangements,
was especially popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1959
alone he had four top 20 hits: ``It's Just a Matter of Time,'' `So
Many Ways,'' ``Endlessly'' and ``Thank You Pretty Baby.''
   Benton, who wrote many of his songs, sang several duets with
Dinah Washington, two of which, ``Baby (You've Got What it Takes)''
and ``A Rockin' Good Way,'' were hits.
   His biggest hit, however, came with ``Rainy Night in Georgia,''
a mournful tune that reached No. 4 on the Billboard pop chart in
1970.
   Benton, born Benjamin Peay in Lugoff, S.C., began singing at an
early age in the Methodist church choir in nearby Camden, where his
father was choir master. He started his career as a gospel singer.
   In recent years, he limited his performances to occasional
nightclub appearances, which concentrated on his hits, among them
``The Boll Weevil Song,'' ``Think Twice,'' ``Revenge,'' ``Frankie
and Johnny'' and ``For My Baby.''
   ``It was Benton's own idea to combine gospel intensity with lush
pop arrangements,'' according to the ``Rolling Stone Record
Guide,'' which described his singing as ``smooth and smoky.''
   ``From rock to ballads to blues, Benton never drops his easy
elegance, yet the swirling strings don't obscure his emotional
intensity,'' said the record guide.
   Benton, who lived in New York, is survived by his wife, Mary;
five children, and his mother, Maddie Peay of Lugoff.

<HEAD>Italian Financier Released From Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARMA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A financier alleged to be the mastermind of
some of the biggest political and financial scandals in postwar
Italy was released from prison Monday because of a serious heart
condition.
   Licio Gelli was extradited from Switzerland less than two months
ago to face charges of fraudulent bankruptcy in the 1982 collapse
of Banco Ambrosiano.
   His release on ``provisional liberty'' was granted by Milan
judges Antonio Pizzi and Renato Brichetti.
   The frail, 68-year-old financier who once was Italy's
most-wanted fugitive left the jail in this north Italian city with
his son, Maurizio.
   Lawyers said Gelli, former head of Italy's outlawed P-2 masonic
lodge, will be hospitalized after a few days of rest at home.
   Gelli had fled Italy in 1981, ahead of a police raid on his
villa which uncovered links between the P-2 lodge and a ring of
right-wing terrorism.
   He was arrested in Switzerland in 1983 for entering the country
with false documents, but escaped from prison after a few months.
   Afer four years in hiding, Gelli surrendered to a Swiss
magistrate in September. He was extradited to Italy on Feb. 17.
   The major scandal involving Gelli was the $1.2 billion collapse
of the Vatican-linked Banco Ambrosiano in 1982.
   Gelli was a close associate of Roberto Calvi, the head of Banco
Ambrosiano who was known as ``God's banker'' because of his links
with the Vatican. Calvi was found hanged in London a few months
after his bank collapse.
   Gelli, held in a maximum-security cell, decided last week to
suspend all medical treatment to press his demand for provisional
liberty.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Honeywell Inc., and a Soviet
government ministry announced Monday they had agreed on a
multimillion-dollar venture to equip Soviet fertilizer plants with
high-technology production control equipment.
   The deal was announced as a group of 400 Americans led by
Commerce Secretary C. William Verity arrived for trade talks with
Soviet officials.
   Prospects for more such joint projects, which the Soviets are
promoting to help stimulate their economy, are a main topic for the
talks of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commercial Commission.
   Honeywell and the Soviet Ministry of Mineral Fertilizer
Production are forming a company that will design automated control
systems for factories under the ministry's jurisdiction and is
expected to sell to third countries as well, said James Verrant, a
Honeywell senior vice president.
   The Soviets hope to boost their fertilizer production by using
the new technology, thereby also improving harvests in the weak
farm economy.
   Honeywell will own 49 percent of the company and the Soviet
ministry will own 51 percent, Verrant said. The company has been
named Sterch, after an endangered species of Siberian crane that
was saved by U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the 1970s.
   A Honeywell statement said the company's investment in the
initial marketing and design phase will be about $1 million.
Verrant told a news conference that once the joint venture begins
installing the production control equipment, purchases from
Honeywell ``could reach somewhere in the neighborhood of $20
million volume'' in the first year of operation.
   Because the Soviet ruble cannot be exchanged for hard currency,
the method of receiving profits is a major problem for Western
firms trying to set up joint ventures with the Soviet Union.
   But Verrant said that under Soviet legislation adopted in
September, the minister of the Soviet fertilizer industry has
access to some of the country's hard currency earnings.
   Honeywell's future income from the project will depend on
increasing the quality and quantity of the fertilizer that can be
marketed to third countries, and on installation in other countries
of systems in plants that the Soviets have helped manage, Verrant
said.
   Most of the joint venture's employees will be Soviets, Verrant
said.
   The agreement will be signed Thursday and official registration
of the company may take a month or more.
   Giorgi Prityko, a top official in the Soviet ministry, said
Bulgaria's 10 years of experience with a similar Honeywell system
was an important reason the Soviets chose the Minneapolis-based
company.
   ``We just adoped the experience acquired by our friends in
Bulgaria,'' he said.
   Members of the Joint Commercial Commission are expected to hear
from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday.
   Verity said last week he expects no breakthroughs in the talks,
although they could improve the climate for greater U.S.-Soviet
trade.
   He said he would stress that expanded trade can take place only
if the Soviets make improvements in other areas such as human
rights and emigration.

   Driving a seven-ton truck carrying
the number 13, Britain's famed Olympic loser Eddie ``The Eagle''
Edwards lived up to his reputation as he stalled out of a race here
on the fifth lap.
   The 24-year-old Cheltenham plasterer ended up watching the
remainder of the race Sunday from the sidelines at this well-known
circuit south of London.
   Edwards was in fifth place and had the crowd of 60,000 roaring
with his spirited handling of the Leyland Roadtrain when he ran up
on the grass while traveling about 90 miles per hour. He then swung
across the track where the engine stalled, jamming in gear.
   Later, still sweating, he said: ``I hadn't been getting things
right on that bend all day. First I couldn't get gears and then I
ran wide. But I shall be back to try again.
   ``Maybe I can try cars next time. They look like fun.''
   Edwards, who came in last in the Calgary Olympics ski-jumping
competition but won the hearts of the fans, had impressed veteran
drivers when he came fourth in a field of 16 professional racing
drivers in his first race on Saturday.

   Presidential candidates Michael Dukakis and George Bush have
lost in the past, but that hasn't kept them from running for office
again, she told a women-in-medicine conference Sunday sponsored by
the University of Miami.
   Among myths Smeal said she's battling are the beliefs that women

   Only after more women are elected will issues such as child and
health care get the attention they need, she said.

   Michael Jackson's jewelry, paintings,
sculptures and furs went to the highest bidder, as Whoopi Goldberg
wielded the auctioneer's gavel.
   The pop star opened his estate to over 300 people who coughed up
``millions of dollars'' to benefit the South African Council of
Churches.
   Jackson was away on tour, but his brother Jermaine and family
patriarch Joseph Jackson were hosts Sunday to the guests who toured
the property and were served cocktails and treated to a band and
magician.
   More than 110 items were auctioned, including a $1.2 million
pearl sold to a buyer whose name wasn't revealed, and a Pablo
Picasso oil painting titled ``Buste d'Homme,'' according to
spokeswoman Sabrina Horn.
   ``It would be safe to say that millions of dollars were
raised,'' Ms. Horn said.
   Miss Goldberg bought an oil painting by Grant Wood valued at
between $300,000 to $500,000, said Ms. Horn, who wouldn't disclose
how much the actress paid.
   The dining room was the only portion of the home open to the
bidders, reporters and photographers.
   Lia Belli, head of the Adelphia Society and wife of attorney
Melvin Belli, arranged the auction. The money is slated for
emergency housing, clothing and medical supplies for displaced
South African families.

   The needs of fish, power generation,
irrigation and recreation hang in the balance as a major drought
parches the Columbia River Basin.
   If current conditions continue for another three years, the
Northwest Power Planning Council says, the situation could be more
severe than the drought preceding the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.
   The Columbia winds 1,243 miles from its headwaters in British
Columbia to the Pacific Ocean on the Oregon-Washington border.
Millions of residents in four states rely on the Columbia and the
region's other major river, the 1,038-mile-long Snake, for their
livelihoods.
   Federal fish and power experts say that if the drought continues
as expected into 1989, the river system could reach the breaking
point.
   Few of the Columbia Basin's 19 major reservoirs are expected to
refill this summer, said Russell George, chief of reservoir
operations for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Even last year,
one of the driest on record, was wet enough to fill the man-made
lakes.
   When the rivers run below normal, managers representing Indian
tribes, three states and the federal government must decide how to
balance competing interests.
   Controlled flows guarantee safe passage during the annual fall
and spring migrations of the salmon and steelhead prized by
commercial, recreational and Indian fishermen.
   The water also spins turbines that light homes and power
businesses throughout the region. In good years, the power flows as
far as Southern California, cutting dependence on non-renewable
sources of energy.
   Starting Friday, a fish migration plan developed by the
Northwest Power Planning Council calls for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to flush immense volumes of water down the Columbia and
Snake rivers until June 15 for the benefit of spring and summer
Chinook salmon smolt.
   Enough water is stored along the Columbia for its young fish,
but the Snake's flow will not meet this year's goals, according to
Peter Paquet, of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission.
   To increase survival, the Army Corps of Engineers plans to use
trucks and barges to transport some of the young fish, a move that
could avert problems faced in the years following the 1977 drought,
when 90 percent of the smolt perished, damaging subsequent fish
runs.
   The receding Columbia River system will reduce hydroelectric
power generated at a series of dams throughout the basin.
   Reservoirs will be 70 percent to 80 percent full this year,
according to Wally Gibson, manager of system analysis and rates for
the Northwest Power Planning Council. The council says the
Northwest's power prospects for 1989 are ``uncertain.''
   The Bonneville Power Administration already has eliminated power
sales to California. It has bought power from sources outside the
region for the first time in 15 years, said Doug Faulkner, chief of
BPA's operations planning branch.
   For irrigators, the second year of drought has brought critical
conditions to several localities, particularly the Yakima Basin in
central Washington.
   Steve Wade, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, said
severe shortages also could occur in southern Idaho, harming onion,
seed and fruit crops. Water is less scarce in the potato-growing
central areas of the state, he said.
   Recreational boaters also face problems because of low water
levels in the reservoirs.

   Since 12-year-old Michelle Alexander
invented ``Give Peace A Chance,'' three years ago, she has played
her board game against such world-class competitors as Andrei
Gromyko and Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``I always lost,'' she admits cheerfully. But then, winning is
not the point of the game, which tries to educate players about
global relations.
   Michelle invented ``Give Peace A Chance'' three years ago as a
project for her third-grade class.
   It's a simple board game similar to Monopoly. Players use small
markers that carry a nation's flag, and they are rewarded for
cooperation with other countries.
   Winners create nuclear free zones, share scientific secrets and
invite children's peace delegations to their countries. Losers
invade smaller countries or refuse to negotiate treaties.
   The game includes a version of the ``Go Directly to Jail'' card,
but with an apocalyptic twist: ``Nuclear warfare between countries.
Game is over for all countries.''
   But the fallout from ``Give Peace A Chance'' has been all
positive for Michelle.
   After her game won first place in the 1985 International
Children's Peace Prize competition, Michelle was selected for a
world tour sponsored by Children As Peace Makers Foundation.
   Last week, Michelle and her mother, Roberta, left on her second
``peace mission'' to the Soviet Union where her game is being
translated into Russian. The Soviet-sponsored Foundation for Social
Inventions is paying for the trip, during which Michelle hopes to
play her game with Soviet children.
   After that, Michelle will receive the World Children's Day
Foundation Award at the United Nations on April 24, then address
children delegates at the U.N. General Assembly.
   ``Almost all children have a hobby and do something that they
really want. I really want world peace. It's a hobby of mine,'' she
said in an interview before she left for the Soviet Union.
   Michelle has played her game with Gromyko, the former Soviet
foreign minister, U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, Chinese
Vice President Ulanhu and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   ``Older people can learn things from children. That's what we're
trying to tell them _ we want to grow up and we want to live,'' she
said.
   ``Give Peace and Chance'' helps teach children and adults alike
that ``there are consequences to our actions, both good and bad,''
said Mrs. Alexander.
   One part of the game asks players to create a peaceful activity
with another country, but Mrs. Alexander said children have an
easier time creating hostile or aggressive acts against their
neighbors.
   One of the most touching moments in her travels, Michelle
recalled, came when a girl from Norway told Gandhi that the
children's peace delegation had toured New Delhi by bus and had
seen other children in the streets with their arms outstretched,
pleading for food and money.
   The girl asked how Gandhi could allow his country to spend so
much money building nuclear weapons while children begged for food
in the streets.
   ``He (Gandhi) said, `We're doing everything we can.' And then
everybody was crying. There wasn't a dry eye in the room,'' she
said.

   The State Department on Monday welcomed a call
by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the Palestine Liberation
Organization recognize Israel's right to exist.
   But the White House seemed to downplay Gorbachev's move.
   ``He has offered those friendly suggestions in the past so it's
not a new proposal,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
``Obviously, we agree that the PLO should recognize Israel's right
to exist.''
   Asked what Gorbachev's motives might be in making his statement,
Fitzwater said, ``It would appear that the Soviet Union is taking a
greater interest in the Middle East.''
   However, Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said
Gorbachev had made ``a positive statement, especially in view of
the fact it was made in the context of Yasser Arafat's visit to
Moscow. For our part, we are continuing our dialogue with the
Soviets on the Middle East.''
   The Communist Party newspaper, Pravda, quoted Gorbachev as
telling Arafat: ``The Palestinians are a people with a difficult
fate. But they receive broad international support, and this is the
guarantee for resolving the main question for Palestinians _
self-determination.
   ``In the same way,'' Gorbachev said, ``recognition of the state
of Israel, consideration of its security interests, the solution of
this question is a necessary element for the establishment of peace
and good-neighborliness in the region based on the principles of
international law.''

<HEAD>State Attorney General Won't File Charges Against Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state attorney general's office today said
it would not file charges against San Diego police officers accused
of perjury or excessive force in connection with a case that raised
allegations of racism and brutality.
   A report issued today concludes an eight-month investigation
into the case involving Sagon Penn, a black who was acquitted in
the killing of one white police officer and the wounding of another.
   Penn claimed he was defending himself against a racially
motivated attack when he grabbed one of the officer's guns and
opened fire in the March 31, 1985, incident. Thomas Riggs was
killed and Donovan Jacobs and civilian observer Sarah Pina-Ruiz
were wounded.
   The state attorney general's investigation arose out allegations
made by Judge J. Morgan Lester, who presided over Penn's second
trial. The judge's public remarks came shortly after Penn was
acquitted in the retrial that ended July 16, 1987.
   Morgan said police officers lied on the witness stand and
suggested that Riggs and Jacobs engaged in ``nightstick justice,''
provoking the struggle that ensued after a traffic stop.
   State Attorney John Van de Kamp said there was insufficient
evidence to support successful prosecution. He also said Penn had
made it clear he didn't want any charges filed against Jacobs.
   Penn was at first reluctant to be interviewed by state
investigators, who interviewed him March 12 only after an immunity
agreement was worked out.
   During the questioning, Penn was unresponsive to many questions
and drifted off into other subjects such as religion and
philosophy, Van de Kamp said.
   Describing Penn as a troubled man, Van de Kamp said he didn't
think Penn would have made a credible witness and that his
testimony would have been crucial to a successful prosecution.
   The perjury allegations stemmed from testimony given by several
San Diego police officers regarding the police investigation and
Jacobs' character, which was described by the defense as bigoted.
   Van de Kamp said that criminal perjury requires a very high
standard of proof. He said the prosecution has to prove that a
witness knowingly gave false testimony in regard to a central issue
of the case.
   ``After careful investigation of eight incidents of possible
perjury, our lawyers concluded that there was either no evidence or
insufficient evidence to meet that very high standard,'' the
attorney general said.
   Another key issue was the possible use of excessive force. Van
de Kamp said there was substantial evidence that officers used
excessive force at the beginning and at the end of the
confrontation.
   But he said there was no evidence to sustain a charge of battery
against Riggs.
   ``As to Agent Jacobs, the decision was much more difficult. The
most consistent accounts from eyewitnesses suggest that Jacobs did
use excessive force, both at the beginning of the incident and
after Penn was on the ground.''
   But because there were conflicting accounts among eyewitnesses,
without coherent testimony from Penn, the state couldn't sustain a
battery charge against Jacobs, he said.

   The Reagan administration expressed firm
support Monday for the refusal by Cypriot officials to comply with
a demand by the hijackers of a Kuwait Airways jet that the aircraft
be refueled.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman also said the United States
supports Kuwait's decision not to abide by the hijackers' demand
for the release of 17 convicted terrorists in that country.
   ``The hijackers are murderers trying to free other convicted
murderers,'' Redman said. ``They must be punished. ''
   He added that the United States is ``appalled at the
cold-blooded murder of two innocent hostages'' aboard the aircraft.
   The second victim, killed on Monday, was identified as a
``Kuwaiti officer.'' He was thrown out of the plane onto the tarmac
at the airport in Larnaca.
   Redman also dismissed as ``cynical'' a threat by the Islamic
Jihad in Beirut to kill the hostages they are holding if any harm
comes to the hijackers.
   ``We continue to hold the kidnapers in Lebanon fully responsible
for the safety and well being of all the hostages there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Interior Department Postpones Offerings of Offshore Oil and Gas
Leases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A heavy workload has forced the Interior
Department to postpone seven planned offerings of offshore oil and
gas leases in 1989, 1990 and 1991, the department said today.
   Four are in federal waters off Alaska, two off California and
one off the mid-Atlantic states.
   The Alaska postponements are in the Navarin Basin, from January
1989 to December 1989; the Norton Basin, from December 1989 to
September 1991; the North Aleutian Basin, from May 1990 to October
1990; and the Navarin Basin, from September 1991 to June 1992.
   The two California postponements, announced last week by members
of that state's congressional delegation, are off Southern
California, from September 1989 to January 1990; and off Central
California, from November 1990 to March 1991.
   The Atlantic offering postponed from October 1989 to December
1989 is for waters from roughly the Rhode Island-Massachusetts
border to a bit south of Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   ``Staff problems and work overloads,'' was how Marcia
Heimberger, spokeswoman for the department's Minerals Management
Service, described the reasons for the changes.
   The California postponements were made necessary by a heavy
volume of comments for a lease offering off northern California
scheduled for next February, she said.
   The new schedule shows 34 remaining offerings under the
five-year drilling plan adopted last July, reflecting the dropping
of the June 1992 offering off the eastern coast of Florida under an
agreement with the state announced in March.

<TEXT>
   Israeli police and soldiers swept into southern
Lebanon and arrested dozens of drug traffickers suspected of
smuggling heroin and hashish into Israel, police said Monday.
   The unusual raid Sunday night was aimed at checking a growing
cross-border drug trade and narcotics addiction in Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone in Lebanon, the officials said.
   Lebanese sources said more than 100 Israeli police with dogs
detained 65 drug traffickers in three villages north of the border,
Bint Jbeil, Klaia and Marjayoun, and confiscated nearly nine pounds
of heroin and cocaine and 110 pounds of hashish.
   An Israeli police spokeswoman, Edna Ziegelshifer, said the
action was to ``keep drug merchants away from Israel and followed
several attempts by traffickers to smuggle drugs accross the
border.''
   She said the troops seized ``different kinds of weapons and a
large quantity of drugs including heroin and hashish,'' but
declined to elaborate.
   Haim Ariev, Israel's liaison officer in south Lebanon, told the
Christian-owned Voice of the South radio station the action also
came in response to local complaints of growing addiction to drugs
smuggled mostly from Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley.
   Israel established the so-called security zone, a six- to
10-mile-wide area north of the border, after withdrawing most of
its occupation troops from Lebanon in 1985.

<HEAD>Eight Maryland Students Must Undergo Random Drug Tests in First
Use of Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEB RIECHMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight University of Maryland students
who were caught using illegal drugs must submit to random urine
tests for three semesters in the first use of the school's
drug-testing policy.
   The policy, implemented at the start of the spring semester in
late January, is believed to be the first at a major university to
require random urine testing for students found using drugs,
according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws, known as NORML. The alternative for students caught with
drugs is suspension.
   The testing program is opposed by some students, who regard it
as an invasion of privacy, unduly harsh and potentially damaging to
a student's future. They also say it is an unjustified backlash to
the 1986 cocaine death of campus basketball star Len Bias.
   Students held a rally last month in protest, and one student
group has collected 800 signatures on petitions opposing the policy.
   William Thomas, vice chancellor for student affairs,
acknowledged that the policy did evolve after Bias' death in June
1986.
   ``But the implication that the university is in a position to do
this only in response to public outcry is incorrect,'' he said.
``We have had a very thorough discussion of our options to deal
with this very difficult issue of drugs. This solution evolved from
that very careful and extended study.''
   Campus officials say they are open to students' suggestions on
how to improve the policy, but believe it is fair, especially as it
offers a way for offending students to stay in school provided they
pass the tests.
   Under the policy, students caught using or possessing illegal
drugs on campus must appear before a hearing board and face either
drug testing or suspension, said Gary Pavela, director of judicial
programs at the university. The student can appeal the decision to
a campuswide committee of students and faculty members, he said.
   ``All the cases so far involve marijuana. And all the
individuals involved reported that their use is casual,'' Pavela
said. ``They have made commitments to us that they will discontinue
the use of drugs, and in return, we have committed ourselves to
minimizing the drug testing'' to a period of three semesters.
   ``I feel they (the administrators) are overstepping their
boundary lines,'' said Edward Joski, who helped form a student
group called Stand Up For Your Rights. ``We don't need a `big
brother' over our head. And this is what they're doing with the
drug testing. They're just way out of line.''
   Instead, the group has called for additional drug education and
counseling on campus.
   Stand Up For Your Rights is especially opposed to drug testing
for first offenders, Joski said.
   ``Just think, you're a freshman. You get caught. You don't have
a chance to repent what you did. You automatically have the cuffs
slapped on you _ you have to go through drug testing,'' he said.
``A lot of Fortune 500 companies won't take you if they see that on
your record. Basically, your whole career could be shot.''
   Jon Gettman, the national director of NORML, argued it is unfair
to determine a student's continued enrollment on the basis of urine
tests.
   ``These students really have a disincentive to achieve because
no matter what they achieve, it is this test, and this test alone,
that will pass judgment on their worthiness to be enrolled at the
university,'' Gettman said. ``No matter what they do, no matter how
well they excel in any field _ academic, athletic, campus
activities _ nothing can offset the damage of getting a positive
urinalysis reading.''
   Pavela said, however, ``I don't think the fact that one might be
a great cheerleader or great student government representative
ought to offset the repeated violation of an important regulation.''
   Enrollment this semester at the College Park campus, including
undergraduates and graduate students, both full and part time, is
35,442, the school said.

   Rep. Beau Boulter battles Houston
businessman Wes Gilbreath on Tuesday in a primary runoff for the
Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   Gilbreath, who has spent about $1 million of his own money in
the race, was the top candidate in the March 8, four-man GOP
primary with 37 percent of the vote. Boulter got 30 percent and
later picked up endorsements from the candidates who ran third and
fourth. The runoff was required because no candidate received a
majority.
   Boulter, 46, also has been endorsed by a majority of Texas
Republican leaders.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., campaigned Monday for Boulter in several
Texas cities. Boulter, a two-term congressman from Amarillo, backed
Kemp's failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.
   The presidential race and Gilbreath's money were the featured
issues in the campaign. Gilbreath, 59, a first-time office seeker,
said Boulter's support of Kemp would hurt Texas if Vice President
George Bush becomes president.
   Boulter said Gilbreath supported former television evangelist
Pat Robertson's unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential
nomination. Gilbreath has declined to say for whom he voted in
Texas' Super Tuesday Republican presidential primary.
   The Boulter campaign spent about $250,000 and complained about
Gilbreath's deep pockets.
   ``I don't think it's healthy to try to buy a nomination with
your own money,'' Boulter said.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, breezed to
renomination in March over a little-known San Antonio professor.
The incumbent has said he does not care which Republican he faces
in his November bid for a fourth term in the U.S. Senate.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Vietnamese officials will hold
immigration talks this week and likely discuss Washington's plan to
accept within two years all children remaining in Vietnam that were
fathered by American servicemen, a U.S. official said Monday.
   Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said
the negotiations also will cover additional Vietnamese immigration
to the United States. Since 1980, 64,000 Vietnamese have gone to
the United States.
   In January, Hanoi agreed in principle to Washington's offer to
resettle within two years the estimated 8,000-12,000 Amerasians and
up to 22,000 close relatives remaining in Vietnam. The United
States has said the children suffer prejudice in Vietnam, which
American troops left in 1973.
   Bruce Beardsley, head of the embassy's refugee office in
Bangkok, will join the talks in Hanoi on Wednesday, Petzing said.
   ``A prime focus of the talks with Hanoi will be the Amerasian
program, and consequently ... the two-year program is likely to be
discussed,'' Petzing said.
   The proposal is based on recent legislation that reclassfied
Amerasians as immigrants rather than refugees, a change likely to
hasten resettlement.
   Since 1980, the United States has accepted more than 4,000
Amerasians under a U.N.-sponsored program. Vietnam suspended its
participation from January 1986 until September 1987, when the
United States agreed to streamline procedures.
   Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said Thursday that
the Americans were ``lazy'' in taking the children and he would
like them to go even quicker than two years.
   ``We have told them they can take them all tomorrow,'' he said.
   The resettlement program was established in 1980 as an
alternative to the flight of refugees in boats.
   Petzing said in the latest round of interviews, U.S. officials
had screened about 1,000 Amerasians and relatives, and 1,000 other
Vietnamese.

   Author Alan Paton, critically ill
with throat cancer, was released from a hospital Monday to spend
his final days at home, his wife said.
   Paton, 85, was hospitalized last week and underwent surgery
April 5 to allow him to swallow solids despite a tumor in his
esophagus. The operation was unsuccessful and a second operation
was ruled out.
   His wife, Anne, said the cancer was spreading fast and the
family decided to have him spend his final days at home.
   ``I am sure he is the happier for it,'' she said.
   Mrs. Paton said over the weekend that her husband had less than
a week to live.
   Paton is best known for his 1948 novel, ``Cry, The Beloved
Country,'' often cited as the most compelling story of South
Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation.
   Paton's last book, ``Journey Continued,'' a sequel to his
autobiography, ``Towards the Mountain,'' is to be published this
month. His publishers had planned a party which Paton was to attend.
   He said in November that ``Journey Continued'' would be his last
book.
   In addition to writing, Paton was a long-time anti-apartheid
political activist.

<TEXT>
   Pilots and flight engineers of Air Inter, the
largest French domestic airline, began a three-day strike Monday,
but company officials said most flights went off as scheduled.
   The strike is one in a series to protest Air Inter's decision to
fly the new Airbus A320 aircraft with only two cockpit crew members
instead of three. The first A320 is scheduled to go into service
with Air Inter in June on the Paris-Grenoble line.
   The personnel have conducted a series of strikes since Feb. 16,
but until Monday had limited the action to the morning hours, from
midnight until 8 a.m., and exempting Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays.
   According to Air Inter, 80 percent of the flights went off
because it used non-striking crews and leased planes from other
companies.
   Since the company made its decision in November 1985 to fly its
A320s with only pilot and co-pilot, the personnel have claimed that
it would be unsafe. Under that system, the flight engineer's
navigating equipment is installed in front of the pilot and
co-pilot.
   The A320 was conceived and certified for flight by a two-member
crew. The smaller crew also means lower operating costs.
   Union members on Monday denounced the lack of negotiations
between the union and the company.

<TEXT>
   U.S. attempts to topple Panamanian strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega have caused ``serious damage'' to Panama's
economy, but it will bounce back, President Reagan's chief
spokesman predicted Monday.
   Marlin Fitzwater said U.S.-imposed sanctions ``were designed to
strangle the financial system'' of the Central American nation but
not harm the general population.
   The spokesman was asked to respond to assertions by leading
Panamanians that the past weeks of financial turmoil have crippled
the country's once-flourishing economic system, perhaps forever.
   Panama, which uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, had become
known as a stable and reliable banking center in both North and
South America.
   But the financial system has been nearly paralyzed since March,
when the United States froze $50 million in Panamanian government
funds in American banks. The U.S. step followed Noriega's ouster of
President Eric Arturo Devalle, who is still recognized by the
administration as Panama's president.
   In an effort to increase pressure on Noriega, Reagan last Friday
invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The law
prohibits payments _ including taxes _ by Americans and U.S.
corporations to the Panamanian government. One administration
official estimated last week that roughly 40 to 50 subsidiaries of
U.S. corporations would be affected.
   The taxes are to be paid to an account opened for deposed
President Delvalle.
   Fitzwater defended the steps as attempting ``to deny Noriega ...
money that could be used to perpetuate his stay in power.''
   ``We have tried to design those sanctions to affect the banking
and financial system of the country and not the general economy ...
and tried to minimize damage to the general public and general
economy while at the same time attacking the points of power that
constitute the base for Noriega staying in there,'' he said.
   ``We don't think it is irreparable harm ... there is serious
damage being done, in terms of the financial system, but we think
the banking system will be able to recover,'' he added.
   Fitzwater contended that the U.S. steps have been effective,
even though Noriega has not yet stepped down.
   Noriega heads Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces and is the
power behind the civilian government.
   In February, two federal grand juries in Florida indicted
Noriega on drug-trafficking charges. The United States imposed
economic sanctions on Panama after Noriega rejected Washington's
demands that he resign and leave the country.
   Reagan's executive order on Friday stopped short of a full
economic embargo on Panama, but violators can be prosecuted for
non-compliance with administration policy for the first time since
U.S.-Panama relations began to sour. Violators can be sentenced to
up to 10 years in prison and $50,000 in fines.

<DATELINE>EATONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to expand a two-lane road to five
lanes has sparked fears that it would destroy the residential
heritage of the nation's first incorporated black community.
   Residents of the 100-year-old community are worried that the
county's plan would threaten the city's history. The Association to
Preserve the Eatonville Community and two private citizens joined
in a class-action suit in March against Orange County.
   The group opposes a 1.3-mile highway which would replace a
two-lane road through the two-square-mile town's commercial and
civic center. The road also would cut through a neighborhood in
nearby Maitland.
   ``I don't think they're paying proper attention to what
Eatonville and Maitland have done to preserve the residential
nature of our cities,'' said Germaine Marvel, a member of the
preservation group.
   ``This is Eatonville's main street. This is where the schools,
the grocery stores, the churches in this little town are located,''
he said.
   John Kingman Keating, an attorney for the group, said the
lawsuit is novel because it says the public need for roads is
outweighed by the greater need to preserve a historically unique
town and to balance transportation improvements with existing
neighborhoods.
   County commissioners say central Florida is growing so rapidly
that something must be done to prevent future traffic jams. They
also think the road could help Eatonville.
   ``It could move commercial interests and increase thair tax
base,'' aid Tom Dorman, chairman of the board of commissioners.
   But most residents don't want the road.
   ``Everyone knows this is a community-busting road,'' said N.Y.
Nathiri, who heads the association against the road-widening.
``You'll have a nonexistent or nonfunctioning black community.''

<HEAD>Hodel Says He Erred in Excluding Some Areas From Offshore Drilling
Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If he had to handle offshore oil and gas sales
all over again, he'd do it differently by starting with all
possible areas up for leasing, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel
told an industry audience Monday.
   ``I would recommend to my successor when he puts together the
next five-year (drilling) plan, that he ought not to exclude areas
from the plan as I did,'' Hodel told a convention of the National
Ocean Industries Association.
   The association represents oil companies operating offshore and
their suppliers.
   Plans drawn up by former Secretaries James Watt in the Reagan
administration and Cecil Andrus under President Carter did not rule
out any offshore areas from the start, relying on procedural steps
at later stages to drop unsuitable areas.
   Hodel noted that in drawing up the current plan, which took
effect last July, he excluded several environmentally sensitive
areas off the California coast such as Big Sur in the hope of
``eliminating arguments over areas not seriously part of anyone's
future drilling objectives.''
   ``But, instead, what I accomplished was what a friend of mine
calls `pre-emptive capitulation,''' Hodel said.
   ``My current view, based upon this experience, is that there
must be some quid pro quo _ such as that provided by Florida
Governor Bob Martinez in our recent negotiations on the Florida
Outer Continental Shelf.''
   Martinez and Hodel agreed last month that areas off the Florida
keys would not be offered for leasing under the current plan,
something Martinez and many Florida environmentalists wanted and
something that was easy for Hodel to grant because there is
believed to be little oil or gas there.
   In exchange, Martinez agreed to drop out of a multi-state legal
challenge to the five-year drilling plan, and not to oppose the
offer of certain tracts off the Florida Panhandle.
   The Florida sale was omitted from a revised schedule of 34
offerings that saw seven lease auctions delayed several months in
1989, 1990 and 1991 because of the pressure of work _ four in
Alaska, one off the mid-Atlantic states and two off California, the
department's Minerals Management Service said Monday.

   An Ohio grandmother hiking to awaken the

   Wearing shorts, a T-shirt and jogging shoes, a smiling Mary

of the U.S. Capitol, triggering cheers from supporters who had
gathered to welcome her.
   ``Let me catch my breath, everybody,'' Ms. Wallace said. ``It
was hard. It was full of blisters and joint pain and back pain and
sunburn and windburn and cars trying to run me down...''
   However, Ms. Wallace, spokeswoman for a group called Rights of
Our Children, said she does not regret making the journey.
   ``I have made this walk to awaken the American people,'' she
said. ``If everyone will just look and see the pain and the
destruction that's happening to America's children, they will
search their hearts and do something about it.''
   Ms. Wallace refused to disclose her age, but said she has a
10-year-old grandson. She left Cincinnati on March 21 and hiked
through Ohio, West Virginia and Virginia before reaching Washington.
   She said she has been ``powerwalking'' for about four years and
averaged about 23 miles a day during her trip.
   ``I'm so exhausted that I don't sleep,'' she said. ``I get about
four hours' of sleep a night.''
   Betty Kuehner, of Cincinnati, followed Ms. Wallace in a car
during the first part of the journey and maintained contact with
her throughout the trip.
   She said Ms. Wallace stayed overnight in the homes or campers of
friends and that there were a few ``campout situations.'' Ms.
Kuehner said her friend walked virtually the entire way, taking
rides only for a few miles on stretches of dangerous highway.
   Ms. Wallace said the most frightening part of the trip occurred
in West Virginia when she was forced to hug the side of a mountain
to avoid being struck by a semitrailer carrying a wide-load cargo.
   ``I dug my toes literally into the side of the culvert against
the stone ... and prayed,'' Ms. Wallace recalled. ``I felt the whiz
of it go across my back.''
   She said she was disappointed she was not able to meet with
President Reagan but that she hopes her walk will spawn legislation
to better protect children.

<HEAD>Paramedic Starts Program To Prepare Emergency Workers For The Worst</HEAD>

   Jeffrey Mitchell will never forget the
sight of a 19-year-old bride killed in an auto crash and pinned in
her car in her bloodied white wedding gown.
   It was several years ago, but the memory of that accident, which
occurred when the newlyweds' car crashed into a pickup truck,
helped lead Mitchell, a former Maryland paramedic, to create a
program to help other paramedics, firefighters and police cope with
the tragedies they encounter.
   In a series of group discussions, called crisis debriefings,
rescuers share their feelings and thoughts about serious accidents,
fires and other disasters and deaths.
   ``It gets people's feelings off their chests, so they are not
feeling it weeks or months later,'' said Dan Hardester, emergency
medical services coordinator in Maitland, in central Florida.
   ``Law enforcement officials view themselves and are viewed by
the citizens as a different kind of people. If you see a
firefighter crying, you would think: `Hey, what's wrong with him?
It's part of the job. If you can't take it, get out.' But they are
not robots. We are all human beings. We have feelings.''
   It's important for emergency workers to vent their feelings or
they later could suffer from serious stress reactions, such as
depression, irritability, confusion, withdrawal and cardiac
disease, said Mitchell, who worked as a paramedic-firefighter for
nine years and holds a doctorate in psychology.
   A debriefing session usually is scheduled one day after a
tragedy. The rescue workers gather with a specially trained
psychologist and with peers, who act as unbiased supporters. The
workers discuss how the incident affected them and how to cope with
the stress. And if the session is successful, they also learn that
their feelings are not unique, Mitchell said.
   Mitchell, who has spoken throughout the country about his
program, trains debriefing teams while also working as assistant
professor of emergency health services at the University of
Maryland.
   Cities and counties across the country use his methods, but only
eight states, including Florida, have coordinated statewide
programs. Orange County was the first in the state to organize a
debriefing team of emergency workers from most area police and fire
departments.
   The team now serves four other counties _ Brevard, Volusia,
Seminole and Lake. A 15-member regional board composed of agency
chiefs coordinates the program in the five counties.
   They call debriefings for traumatic events, such as deaths or
serious injuries to children or co-workers. Since March 1987, the
team has scheduled 13 debriefings, including one after a gunman
killed six people and injured 28 in Palm Bay last April.
   Maitland paramedic Kim Neisler wishes the program had been
available for her a few years ago when she worked on a case in
which a Maitland man killed his young son, then killed himself and
set his apartment on fire.
   The boy looked like Neisler's nephew.
   She spent a night in a hospital wracked by nausea and finally
became dehydrated as a result.
   ``I tried to go back and deal with it myself, but basically I
didn't deal with it,'' she said.

   Bounty from two shipwrecks discovered by
treasure hunter Mel Fisher, including a 5{-foot-long solid gold
chain, will be sold in June, Christie's auction house said Monday.
   The gold, silver and emeralds from the sunken, 17th century
Spanish galleons Nuestra Senora de Atocha and Santa Margarita were
uncovered west of the Florida Keys in a 17-year treasure hunt.
Fisher's team salvaged more than 300,000 pieces of cargo and
wreckage, including 57 tons of gold and silver.
   The gold chain has a presale estimate of $200,000 to $250,000.
Also being auctioned June 14 are a coral and gold rosary estimated
at $250,000, a silver-gilt wine cup, $150,000 to $250,000, and a
silver-gilt rose water dish, $80,000 to $120,000. There also are
four astrolabes, rare navigational instruments used by 17th century
mariners, estimated at $50,000 to $80,000 apiece.
   Fisher's company, Treasure Salvors Inc., was liquidated so the
proceeds can be divided among its stockholders.

   After nearly 40 years on their own, members of
the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union will vote
this week on whether to join the AFL-CIO.
   About 350 delegates of the West Coast dockworkers' union will
vote at the ILWU international convention in Vancouver, British
Columbia, on the possible affiliation.
   In the late 1940s, the ILWU was tossed out of the Committee for
Industrial Organizations, a forerunner of the CIO, for alleged
communist domination. The CIO merged with the AFL in 1955.
   ``I think it's going to pass without any problems,'' said John
Bukoskey, the international's representative for Washington, Oregon
and Alaska. ``But I think there will also be quite a bit of debate.
After all, we were asked to leave.''
   He said that rejoining the federation would improve the ILWU's
bargaining power and its ability to lobby for national legislation.
   ILWU President Jimmy Herman and AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland
have agreed in principle to the reaffiliation, said Danny Beagle,
spokesman for the San Francisco-based ILWU.
   The 24,000-member union was formed in 1937 when it broke with
the New York-based International Longshoremen's Association. Harry
Bridges led the ILWU from 1934 until 1977.

<HEAD>Senate Shows Support for Budget Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate showed support Monday for a $1.1
trillion fiscal 1989 budget built to comply with deficit-reduction
promises while increasing spending for the AIDS fight, the space
program and education.
   The spending plan cleared an initial parliamentary hurdle 83-0,
and debate began at the earliest date in years. Although the law
allows 50 hours of debate time, a final vote was considered
possible by Tuesday.
   The smoothness of the process didn't stop an undercurrent of
concern and frustration that the election-year plan wasn't doing
enough about the deficit.
   ``We're running just a few steps in front of the avalanche of
death,'' said Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee. But given current political constraints, he said,
the best the Congress could do was ``make sure that next year's
burden grows no larger.''
   The estimated deficit of $136 billion would meet the mandate of
the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. But it represents only a
modest reduction in red ink from the $146.7 billion predicted for
the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   Congress will have to ``do much better in the years to come,''
said Chiles, who is retiring after this year.
   Chiles and Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the budget
committee's senior Republican, drafted the budget in compliance
with last fall's deficit agreement between congressional leaders
and President Reagan.
   The pact set overall spending guidelines and took away what is
usually the biggest point of contention _ the balance between
domestic and military spending.
   Under the agreement, the Senate budget proposes for the Pentagon
to spend $294.0 billion next year. Domestic agencies would spend
$169.2 billion, while foreign aid would total $16.1 billion.
   The agreement also pre-determined that no new taxes would be
included in the budget plan, beyond the $14 billion in new taxes
enacted last December.
   The Senate, as the House did in adopting its budget last month,
was using the administration's optimistic assumptions about the
nation's economy. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
predicts a deficit some $35 billion above the Gramm-Rudman target.
   Within the overall guidelines of last fall's agreement, the
Senate proposal re-arranges some domestic priorities that Reagan
proposed when he submitted his budget in February.
   While many domestic agencies will face belt-tightening to absorb
inflationary costs, the budget rejects the president's call for
eliminating several domestic development and mass-transit programs.
   It also rejects his request for tightening up in the Medicare
system. The deficit-reduction agreement did not cover Social
Security or most other benefit programs and none of this year's
budget plans has envisioned cuts in those areas.
   The House and Senate budgets, like Reagan's proposal, call for
big spending increases on the space program, research on AIDS,
education and air traffic safety.
   The Senate plan also endorses Reagan's plan to give a 4.3
percent pay hike to the military and only 2 percent for civilian
federal workers. The House voted a 3 percent across-the-board raise.
   The Senate and House must settle on a single budget resolution
before it becomes final. The budget resolution is a guideline for
Congress' fiscal legislation, and it does not require the
president's signature.

<HEAD>Gore Against Palestinian State, But Sees Possibility of Autonomy
Tryout</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said Monday that he is not
in favor of a Palestinian state but that some sort of temporary
autonomy could be tested on the West Bank.
   ``I support the Camp David formula, which points us toward a
period of limited autonomy, during which Israel and the
Palestinians would be able to judge what autonomy is like in
practice,'' Gore said. ``Now the exact formula must be arrived at
by the parties themselves.''
   Those parties include Israel, Jordan, the Palestinians ``and
perhaps Syria,'' Gore told reporters during a question-and-answer
session in the board room at the New York Stock Exchange.
   Whatever happens, Gore said, ``it's unthinkable to have an
armed, military, hostile presence so close'' to Israel's borders.
   ``I think that the eventual formula has to involve assurances
that Israel's security will not incur an additional threat,'' said
the Democratic presidential aspirant from Tennessee.
   Gore was in town campaigning for the delegate-rich April 19 New
York primary. Two hundred fifty-five delegates are at stake for the
three remaining Democrats: Gore, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
and Jesse Jackson. Gore is far behind the other two in the delegate
count.
   Before talking to reporters, Gore addressed leaders from the
securities industry in the stock exchange board room.
   During a wide-ranging session with reporters later, Gore said
that he was glad Jackson seemed to distance himself from the
Palestine Liberation Organization and that he always thought Gov.
Mario Cuomo was not a candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   On Sunday, Jackson said that if he were elected president he
would not meet with PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Gore had criticized
Jackson for being too close to the PLO, and was asked by reporters
Monday if he took credit for what he termed ``a very useful
statement'' from Jackson.
   ``No, I'm not taking credit for that. He deserves credit for
it,'' Gore said. ``But by raising the issues openly instead of just
behind the scenes I think it makes it a healthy process and creates
opportunities for questions and answers that break new ground.''
   The Tennessee senator added that ``I think that one of the
purposes that can be served by drawing contrasts in a primary
campaign is by making it possible for candidates to more clearly
... elaborate their positions. I know I have grown during this
campaign. I know the other candidates have.''
   Also during the weekend, Cuomo said the correct interpretation
of statements he has made is that he wouldn't accept a nomination
draft if one were offered at the Democratic convention next July.
   ``He has encouraged people to look favorably at all the active
candidates,'' Gore said. ``I never thought he was a candidate
because he told me he wasn't a candidate.''

<HEAD>Endangered Sea Turtles Get Special Treatment Off Cape Canaveral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the need to keep the entrance
channel to Cape Canaveral free for submarine passage, the federal
government is taking the slow route in dredging the waterway in
order to protect endangered sea turtles.
   Federal officials have hired a team of University of Florida
zoologists to study turtle populations at different times of the
year to guide future channel dredging, said Karen Bjorndal,
director of the Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research at the
university.
   The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service told the Army Corps
of Engineers to use only the safest dredging method to avoid
harming the turtles, she said.
   The Corps would like to use hopper dredging, which sucks up
sediment with a tremendous hydraulic force, Ms. Bjorndal said
Monday.
   ``The problem is that the sea turtles get sucked up too and torn
into pieces,'' she said.
   The alternative is clam-shell dredging, in which a large bucket
slowly scoops up sediment.
   ``While our work is basic research, it has a great effect on
potential management and conservation decisions,'' said Alan
Bolten, one of the researchers who catch, tag, measure and
determine the species and sex of each turtle. The turtles are
returned to the water within 30 minutes of their capture.
   ``A two-day study doesn't give you enough information because of
the dynamics of sea turtle distribution,'' Bolten said. ``A number
of years of data need to be collected for a bigger picture.''
   The team did one survey of the channel last month and plans
return trips in May and September.

<HEAD>Movie Critic Rex Reed Pleads Guilty To Attempted State Income Tax
Evasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Movie critic Rex Reed pleaded guilty Monday
to two counts of attempting to evade the state's income tax in a
dispute he blamed on faulty advice from an accountant.
   Appearing in City Police Court, Reed, 49, entered a guilty plea
on the two misdemeanor counts that stemmed from his failing to file
state returns in 1984 and 1985 while he was a columnist for the New
York Post.
   He was fined $2,000 and must pay $50 in court costs.
   Reed had already paid approximately $20,000 in delinquent taxes,
penalties and interest to the state Department of Taxation and
Finance.
   ``It's ironic that this would happen on Academy Awards day,'' he
said afterward, adding that he would miss attending the ceremony in
person because he couldn't get a flight to Los Angeles from Albany
in time, and would have to settle for watching it on television.
   ``I'll miss Cher's navel,'' he quipped.
   The Tax Department found that the Post paid Reed as an
independent contractor for 1984 and 1985, ``therefore he was
earning income from a New York state employer, but had not filed
the New York state returns,'' said Nancy Connell, a spokeswoman for
the state attorney general's office.
   Reed said he could have avoided the $2,000 fine if he were to
prove that he was a Connecticut resident during 1984 and 1985, but
he didn't want to face the prolonged legal battle. Reed said it was
easier for him to ``give them their pound of flesh for two thousand
bucks.''
   Tax officials said Reed's primary address was New York City.
   Reed, who currently appears on the television show ``At The
Movies,'' worked as a columnist for the Post from 1982 until last
year. He was also a columnist for the Daily News for 12 years
before writing for the Post.

<TEXT>
   A man whose charred body was found
near a Hare Krishna commune was shot in the head by a small-caliber
gun, authorities said Monday, but they do not know if the death was
a suicide or homicide.
   State Medical Examiner Irvin Sopher said in an autopsy report
that he found a .22-caliber slug in the man's brain.
   ``He determined the bullet entered through the right temple
area,'' Marshall County Prosecutor Thomas White said.
   Parts of a burned .22-caliber pistol were found near the body,
believed to be that of Todd Schenker, the prosecutor said.
Authorities found ammunition for the gun inside Schenker's nearby
house.
   Marshall County Sheriff Donald Bordenkircher said a lack of
dental records has stymied attempts to identify the remains
positively. However, the sheriff said all evidence gathered so far
points to Schenker, a former member of the Hare Krishna community
at New Vrindaban.
   ``We're not making any judgments at this time between homicide
and suicide. The medical evidence can't tell us that,'' White said.
   Schenker's wife, Judith, was taken to the Ohio Valley Medical
Center for a psychiatric evaluation after members of the New
Vrindaban community told county mental health authorities that she
had ``made suicidal comments,'' the prosecutor said.
   ``It was for her own protection,'' he said.
   Gadadhar Das, a spokesman for New Vrindaban, said Mrs. Schenker
had mentioned suicide to several members of the community after the
body was found.
   ``We brought her in to the local authorities,'' Gadadhar said.
``Whether it be suicide or foul play, we would like to see the
whole thing straightened out. We've cooperated fully with the
sheriff's department on this.''

   President Reagan, hailing the ``valiant
struggle of the Afghan people,'' announced today that he will send
Secretary of State George Shultz to Geneva to sign the accord
ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
   ``I believe the United States can now join the Soviet Union as a
guarantor of the Geneva instruments,'' Reagan said of the accord,
which opens the way for the pullout of the 115,000-man Red Army and
a return of millions of Afghan refugees to Afghanistan.
   Reagan said the proposed pact ``would provide for the complete
withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces from that country.''
   Shultz is to represent the United States at the signing
ceremony, which is expected to be held Thursday.
   ``This development would not have been possible had it not been
for the valiant struggle of the Afghan people to rid their country
of foreign occupation,'' Reagan said, adding, ``We take great pride
in having assisted the Afghan people in this triumph and they can
count on our continued support.''
   Reagan also lauded Pakistan for its role as a home to millions
of Afghan refugees during the period of Soviet domination of
Afghanistan.
   Shultz told reporters after Reagan's announcement that beginning
May 15, the Soviet Union is to begin withdrawing its 115,000 troops
from Afghanistan, with 50 percent of the forces removed over a
three-month period. All remaining Soviet forces are to be out by
Feb. 15, 1989.
   He said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has promised
to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year, ahead of the
deadline. He said the United States will ``push for that and expect
that.''
   While hailing the agreement, Shultz said, ``The withdrawal of
Soviet troops is obviously not the end of the matter.''
Negotiations will continue for the establishment of an interim
government. ``We know it's not easy, it will be hard,'' Shultz said.
   Underscoring Reagan's pledge of continued aid for the
U.S.-backed rebels, Shultz said, ``We have stood by the Afghan
people during this 8{ years and we're prepared to stand by them in
the coming months to help Afghans return home and begin rebuild
their lives and their country.''
   Shultz's Geneva trip gives him another chance to meet with
Shevardnadze before talks in Moscow next week to continue
preparations for the superpower summit meeting in the Soviet
capital beginning May 29.
   Prior to the announcement, Shultz reported to Reagan on his
Middle East talks last week with Arab and Israeli leaders, which
failed to produce a breakthrough to negotiations. But Shultz vowed
to find the time to return and to continue his effort.
   Setting the tone for the coming summit in Moscow with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Reagan said Sunday he looks forward to
the signing of an agreement providing for the withdrawal of Red
Army forces from Afghanistan.
   ``If that accord is complied with, and Soviets withdraw
irrevocably from that long-suffering country, this will be a great
victory for its heroic people,'' he said at a broadcasters'
convention in Las Vegas, Nev. ``It will also be a major
contribution to the improvement of East-West relations.''
   However, Reagan said the Russian economy remains in trouble and
he doesn't know how the Soviet Union will be able to compete in a
changing world marked by new technologies.
   `` ...Nations will have to grant to their scientists complete
freedom of inquiry; to their businessmen and entrepreneurs, freedom
to invest, to risk, to create new products and with them new
markets,'' Reagan said.
   ``The Soviets and their clients must open their countries to
ever-wider freedoms. Or they will see their economies _ indeed
their whole way of life _ fall further behind,'' he said.
   Reagan made only a passing reference to the agreement reached in
Geneva for the pullout of the Soviets' 115,000 troops from
Afghanistan.
   ``We're very optimistic, but nothing has been signed yet,''
Reagan told reporters.
   The agreement is to be signed Thursday.
   The president's top aides continued planning for the Moscow
summit while Reagan and his wife, Nancy, vacationed the past 10
days at their mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif. They
returned to Washington on Sunday.
   The May 29-June 2 summit with Gorbachev is seen by many as the
likely capstone to the Reagan presidency, with Reagan spending much
of the rest of the year on the 1988 political campaign trail.
   Reagan noted that the summit will come almost a year after he
flew to West Berlin to demand that the Soviets destroy the Berlin
Wall.
   ``As I challenged him in Berlin before the Washington
(superpower) summit, I challenge Mr. Gorbachev here today, before
the summit in Moscow, to tear down this other wall, this grim,
invisible wall of oppression,'' he said.
   Reagan said that while headway has been made on emigration,
people-to-people exchanges between Americans and Russians and his
own access to Soviet television, much more needs to be done.
   Reagan also called on Gorbachev to work for more openness in the
Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries for Western authors,
journalists and broadcasters.

<HEAD>Soviet Condemns Guerrilla Attack on Plane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet television on Monday condemned Afghan
guerrillas for shooting down a Soviet-built passenger jet with 29
people aboard after announcements that a negotiated end to the
10-year-old Afghan war is near.
   The national news program ``Vremya'' showed wreckage strewn over
a valley near the Afghan city of Maimaneh, about 90 miles south of
the Soviet border.
   A Tass news agency commentary blamed the attack on the leaders
of the ``Peshawar Seven,'' the main guerrilla organization based in
Pakistan. It accused the leaders of prolonging the bloodshed at a
time when Afghans were inspired by recent news from Geneva that the
fighting will cease and 115,000 Soviet soldiers will go home.
   An Afghan air force colonel told Soviet TV that a U.S. Stinger
missile had been used to down the plane carrying both government
soldiers and civilians.
   ``This act is especially cynical because it was committed when
all Afghan people were inspired by the joint Soviet-Afghan
statement by Mikhail Gorbachev and Najib,'' said the colonel,
identified only as Zahir, referring to Thursday's announcement by
the Soviet and Afghan leaders that all obstacles had been removed
to the signing of a peace accord.
   Tass said guerrilla alliance leader Gulbuddin Hekmeyar vowed to
carry on the armed fight, and that the insurgents had ``already
shot down several civilian planes and the number of those killed
amounted to almost 200.'' It was not clear over how long a period
of time the casualties were inflicted.
   ``The leaders of the insurgents are unwilling to listen to the
voice of reason and to join the settlement process,'' Tass said,
referring to Najib's call for insurgents to lay down their arms and
join his government.
   Pakistan and Afghanistan have announced agreement on a package
of measures to end the war in Afghanistan between Najib's army,
backed by about 115,000 Soviet soldiers, and guerrilla forces based
in Pakistan and armed primarily by the United States.
   The negotiated peace plan is to be signed on Thursday in Geneva,
where indirect talks moderated by U.N. representative Diego
Cordovez have been under way since 1983.
   Under the Geneva plan, Soviet troops will begin leaving
Afghanistan on May 15 and at least half will be out within three
months. The remainder would be obligated to leave Afghanistan
within 10 months of the start of the pullout, but Soviet officials
have indicated they plan to have their soldiers home by the end of
this year.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979.
   The United States and the Soviet Union are expected to act as
guarantors of the Geneva agreement under a plan worked out behind
the scenes that would ensure ``symmetry'' in continued aid to the
warring sides.
   Afghan negotiators had insisted on an end to U.S. weapons
deliveries to the guerrillas once the Soviet pullout began, but
American observers at the Geneva talks refused to abide by it
unless the Kremlin stopped arming Najib's troops.
   Soviet officials deemed the U.S. demand an infringement of its
right to enter into bilateral agreements with a sovereign neighbor
and initially refused the ``symmetry'' plan.
   But diplomatic and official sources have reported in recent days
that Moscow and Washington have worked out an agreement ensuring a
balance in aid or a moratorium on arms shipments to the warring
sides.
   Earlier Monday, Tass reported that insurgents attacked Maimaneh,
killing 13 people and causing serious damage.

<HEAD>Criminal Penalties Proposed For Fraud In Scientific Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee member raised the
possibility Monday of imposing criminal penalties against
scientists who deliberately falsify their research, but several
whistleblowers protested that such a solution would be excessively
harsh.
   The suggestion of a federal statute making scientific fraud or
misconduct a criminal offense was made by Rep. John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., at a hearing of the House Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations.
   ``Why are scientists in a different position from anyone else
who acts against the public interest?'' demanded Conyers, who also
is a member of the House Judiciary Committee.
   ``Your point is an excellent one, and it makes me squirm,''
replied Walter Stewart, a nerve cell researcher at the National
Institutes of Health who is a part-time investigator of scientific
misconduct in the research community.
   But Stewart and a colleague, Dr. Ned Feder, expressed concern
that the threat of criminal penalties might create a damaging
climate of fear among scientists.
   Two private whistleblowers, Professor Robert L. Sprague of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Dr. Jerome G.
Jacobstein of the graduate hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania at Philadelphia, both said Conyers' idea was ``going
too far.''
   Sprague waged a nearly four-year effort to call attention to
scientific fraud committed by Dr. Stephen Breuning, who used a
grant from the National Institute of Mental Health for research
into drug treatment of mentally retarded patients.
   Jacobstein blew the whistle on Dr. Jeffrey S. Borer, a
cardiologist and professor at Cornell University Medical College,
for allegedly inducing a medical student to make numerous
misrepresentations in a report of their scientific study.
   Sprague expressed interest when the subcommittee chairman, Rep.
Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., suggested that one solution might be to create
an anti-fraud watchdog organization within the scientific community.
   ``It is not a question of too many watchdogs,'' Weiss said. ``We
seem to have no watchdogs at all in this situation.''
   Weiss complained that neither the National Institutes of Health,
universities where research financed by NIH grants is conducted,
nor the professional scientific societies has shown a willingness
to guard against fraudulent research.
   ``You can't have it both ways,'' Weiss said, expressing sympathy
with Conyers' suggestion for criminal penalties. ``We can't have a
continuation of flagrant abuses and say no one can be held
accountable because it might hurt morale.''
   Stewart agreed with Conyers that scientific fraud threatens
``incredible harm and injury to the public,'' but expressed
optimism that scientists will find a way to police themselves
without federal intervention.
   Replied Conyers: ``The whole point of criminal laws is to
deter.''
   Jacobstein said extreme forms of scientific fraud, such as
wholesale fabrication of research data, is ``fairly rare.'' But he
estimated that 20 percent to 30 percent of research papers contain
unethically flawed results.
   ``The whole climate just fosters this generally feeling that
everyone does it,'' he said.
   Stewart and Feder, who testified jointly, said they have talked
to ``considerably more than 20 scientists who have alleged
misconduct to us privately,'' but have been reluctant to make
formal charges through the NIH bureaucracy.
   ``Their reluctance strongly suggests to us that the reported
cases of misconduct represent only a small fraction of the total,''
they said.
   Based on questions raised by Stewart and Feder, the NIH has
formed a special committee to investigate allegations that research
data was misrepresented in a paper published by Nobel laureate
David Baltimore, director of the Whitehead Institute in Boston, and
by Therza Imanishi-Kari of Tufts University.
   Baltimore, who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for research in
cellular biology, said last week that he welcomed the NIH
investigation. Baltimore said he hoped it would silence Stewart and
Feder, who he said had ``acted like a judge and jury'' in the case.

   The flighty feelings newlyweds Dewaine
Smith and Lu Kizer experienced were different from the butterflies
that overcome most couples exchanging wedding vows.
   The pilot and travel agent were married 9,500 feet above Hall
County on Saturday in a nine-seat airplane dubbed ``Lovebird One''
for the occasion.
   The Rev. Alvin Smith, the groom's father and a retired minister,
officiated. It was his 339th ceremony, but his first airborne.
   Smith, a Scottsbluff pilot, met his wife, a Grand Island travel
agent, during layovers at the Central Nebraska Regional Airport. He
asked her to a party in August and the romance never stopped.
   Best man Larry Carstenson said ``Lovebird One'' hit major
airpockets during take-off and landing, in addition to one when the
bride said ``I do.'' Otherwise, the flight was smooth.
   Carstenson, a lawyer, said the biggest concern was making sure
the ceremony occurred over Hall County, where the license was
obtained. He said if the plane strayed, the marriage could have
been declared invalid.

   Vermont Law School students
discovered April 1 that the state was in the process of trying to
buy their school.
   It was a big story _ but it would have been bigger if it were
true.
   The biweekly school newspaper ran the April Fools' Day gag on
page one, describing in great detail a complicated process by which
the school would be purchased and then leased back.
   ``I spent a lot of time researching to make sure the story was
credible. I wanted to make it as credible as possible,'' said Kurt
Terwilliger, the author of the article. ``Maybe I got a little
carried away.''
   The article never said it was an April Fools' joke and the
newspaper was the same as usual except for the date _ March 32,
1988.
   Near the end of the article, Terwilliger reported that tuition
would drop dramatically following the sale because of the state's
surplus and the tax-exempt status of the school under state
ownership.
   The too-good-to-be-true news prompted students to overrun the
business office with inquiries about the possibility of tuition
rebates.
   ``There were students coming into the business office in twos
and threes,'' said Steve Hesse, editor of the Forum.

   Her latest victory came Sunday when a blue-spotted tabby named
Amy was given the 9-Lives Morris Award after being judged the best
household cat at Denver's Campaign Tails spring cat show.
   In fact, four of Jackson's six contestants swept the household
competition at the show, sponsored by the Foot of the Rockies Cat

   Cages for Amy, Chip, Koko and Little Miss Muffet were covered

   ``I'm doing very well, without boasting,'' said Jackson, who
said she is known as a ``cat lady'' back home in Salt Lake City.

   Vice President George Bush suggested
Monday that American Jews should vote for him rather than a
Democrat because ``I'm a good friend of Israel.''
   Bush made the comment as he spoke to reporters during a tour of
an IBM office here during a day of low-key campaigning.
   The vice president, now running virtually unopposed for the
Republican presidential nomination, was asked to comment on remarks
by New York Mayor Edward Koch that New York Jews should not vote
for Democrat Jesse Jackson in the state's April 19 primary.
   ``Listen, we've got enough problems on our own side to get into
the Democratic nominating process,'' Bush said.
   ``Ed Koch is entitled to his opinion. Each candidate is entitled
to run on his own record. There is no point in my fine-tuning Ed
Koch's comments,'' Bush said.
   He said Jews should consider voting for him. ``I think everyone
shold vote for me. Besides that, I'm a good friend of Israel.''
   Bush toured an IBM high-tech training center here, was shown how
computers can be used in designing and manufacturing products, and
spoke to a group of IBM employes.
   IBM officials said that Bush had requested the tour. In his
speech to employees, Bush talked of the importance of training and
education in keeping U.S. industry competitive _ one of his
favorite campaign themes.
   Earlier in the day, he told a noon crowd in a shopping mall in
nearby White Plains that he was ready to face whichever candidate
Democrats select to oppose him.
   ``We don't have all the excitement that exists on the Democratic
side of the aisle, but we have a lot more unity and fewer
problems,'' he said.
   Bush was also to attend a fund-raiser in Greenwich, Conn., and
to spend the night in Schenectady, N.Y., on the first leg of his
three-day campaign swing.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Pakistani bomb disposal
experts Monday began defusing thousands of deadly missiles and
grenades strewn around the capital after an explosion at an
ammunition dump killed 93 people and injured 1,100.
   Security forces and rescue teams also searched flattened
buildings for hundreds of people still unaccounted for after
Sunday's blast.
   President Mohammad Zia Ul-haq, who cut short a visit to Kuwait,
called the explosion an ``extraordinary accident.''
   Zia refused to speculate on the cause of the fire which ignited
the ammunition dump explosion at Ojeri camp between the twin cities
of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
   Commenting on reports that some of the ordnance was earmarked
for Moslem guerrillas in Afghanistan and that some empty casings
bore Chinese labels, Zia said: ``It's nothing but speculation _ a
high measure of speculation.''
   Witnesses saw burning trucks Sunday near the depot bearing
Afghan license plates. Pakistan is a conduit for foreign military
supplies and other aid to the Afghan insurgents fighting the
communist government in Kabul backed by an estimated 115,000 Soviet
troops.
   Zia, who disclosed the number of dead and injured, received
messages of sympathy from various heads of state, including a
message from Afghan President Najib.
   ``I wish to convey our deepest condolences to the families who
suffered from this tragic incident and to all people of the
republic of Pakistan,'' Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, quoted
Najib's message as saying.
   Streets in the two cities were littered with an estimated 6,500
unexploded anti-tank mortars, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades
and other devices.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Kent Obee said the embassy had offered
the Pakistani government help in finding and clearing the weapons.
   A four-man American explosives expert team arrived Sunday night
from the U.S. Task Force in northern Arabian Sea.
   Obee said the team would also clear ammunition that fell in 10
to 12 residences of U.S. Embassy employees. There were no injuries
or major damage, he added.
   He said the team began its work Monday and will continue as long
as needed. He stressed that the Americans would not investigate the
blast.
   Zia said seven Pakistani soldiers were killed and 32 injured in
the explosion. On Monday, he toured the areas around the blast site
and visited hospitals to talk with the wounded.
   Police and army patrolled the streets and some people began
repairing their houses.
   Pakistan radio and neighborhood mosques appealed for missing
people.
   Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo said the injured and the
families of the bereaved will be compensated and ordered an enquiry
into the cause of the explosion.
   He also said all ammunition depots situated within populated
areas will be shifted to safer and isolated places.
   Some Western embassies said they received anonymous telephone
calls warning of a terrorist bombing shortly before the depot blew
up at about 10 a.m.
   Obee said the U.S. Embassy did not receive such a call.
   Shortly before the explosion, a small group of Moslem
fundamentalists were preparing to march toward the U.S. Embassy to
protest against Israeli action against the Palestinian uprising in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In India, two people were killed and at least 100 others injured
Monday when police clashed with mobs of students who tried to close
shops in northern Kashmir state to show sympathy for the victims of
the weekend explosion.
   The United News of India reported that the injured included 70
policemen.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
Kashmir. Some of the Moslems, who predominate in Kashmir state,
want to unite with Pakistan.

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole returned to
his Capitol duties Monday after long months on the presidential
campaign trail and made clear he wants to keep his job.
   ``The Senate is such a unique place to work in, and I certainly
treasure the opportunity to serve in the role my colleagues have
honored me with,'' Dole told fellow senators.
   Senators of both parties hastened to welcome Dole back, and
Senate Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia said, ``He
fought the good fight and who knows what may be the outcome of his
efforts yet.''
   Dole had Kansas on his mind and, in his first official act,
secured passage of a Senate resolution congratulating the
University of Kansas Jayhawks basketball team on its capture of the
NCAA basketball championship with a ``heartstopping'' victory over
the University of Oklahoma.
   ``K.U.'s stunning march to the championship shocked the experts
and thus proved that no dream is ever too big to dream,'' the
resolution declared.
   Dole singled out the role of the Jayhawks' coach, Larry Brown,
and said that when the Kansas team won he had telegraphed his
congratulations.
   ``I had a feeling that in 1988 somebody in Kansas would turn out
to be famous _ and it turned out to be you,'' Dole said.

   An Air Force jet crashed into a warehouse
complex today, but both crew members ejected and parachuted to the
ground, fire and Air Force officials said.
   Airman Kim Lowery of Bergstrom AFB in Austin said the crew
members from the RF-4C Phantom II jet were being examined by Air
Force medical officers at Bergstrom. There was no immediate word on
their conditions.
   Lt. Larry Morris, Austin Fire Department spokesman, said there
were no immediate reports of injuries on the ground.
   Fire department officials said the blaze caused by the crash was
brought under control about an hour after the accident.
   The jet was returning from a low-level training mission when the
crash occurred about 12:15 p.m., Ms. Lowery said.
   The crew members were identified as Col. Roger L. Grimsley, 47,
from Leesburg, Ohio, the pilot. Capt. Terence C. Ganiko, 30, of
Honolulu, Hawaii, was the weapon systems officer.
   The RF-4C is the reconnaissance version of the F-4
fighter-bomber.
   Air Force officials said a special board of officers would
investigate.

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American judge on the
International Court of Justice said Monday the United Nations
should step aside in its dispute with the Reagan administration
over the PLO's U.N. office in New York.
   A U.N. official argued before the world court that the United
States is ducking its international responsibility by trying to
close the PLO mission.
   The diplomatic tug-of-war stems from anti-terrorist legislation
signed by President Reagan in December. The law classifies the
Palestine Liberation Organization as a terrorist group and bars it
from operating on U.S. territory.
   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III has tried to use the law
to close the 14-year-old mission with U.N. observer status.
   In Monday's 90-minute session of the world court, American Judge
Stephen M. Schwebel challenged a U.N. claim that the Reagan
administration moves constitute an immediate threat to the PLO's
presence in New York.
   He said the United States has said it would wait for a ruling
from a U.S. District judge in New York, and he said the United
Nations should do the same. The U.S. Justice Deparment has asked
the judge to rule in favor of the closure in a case initially
brought by the PLO.
   The United Nations has asked the world court to issue an opinion
against such a closure, which has been denounced by all U.N.
members but Israel and the United States. The United Nations says
the dispute should be arbitrated by a special, three-member panel.
   The world court, the U.N.'s judicial arm, lacks legal powers to
enforce its decisions and can only issue advisory opinions.
   U.N. Undersecretary-General Carl-August Fleischhauer of West
Germany said Monday that the American move to close the PLO office
violates a 1947 agreement between the international organization
and the Truman administration.
   The United Nations says that accord, which guarantees the
unimpeded functioning of diplomats accredited to U.N. headquarters,
also applies to missions with observer status.
   The PLO was granted permanent observer status at the United
Nations in 1974 and has maintained an office near U.N. headquarters
in Manhattan ever since.
   In a brief released by the court Monday, the United Nations
stated ``the question at issue goes far beyond the particular
dispute and has far-reaching consequences for the ... discharge of
the responsibilities of the United Nations in the world at large.''
   The court asked Fleischhauer, the U.N.'s undersecretary-general
for legal affairs, to respond in writing to its queries later this
week. Fleischhauer told reporters Monday he expected a decision by
the end of May.
   There were no representatives of either the Reagan
administration or the PLO at the world court on Monday.

<HEAD>Airline Smoking Ban Covers Any Flight Over Two Hours</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The airline smoking ban that goes into effect
April 23 on commercial aircraft will apply to any flight scheduled
for two hours or less even if delays cause the flight to take
longer, the Federal Aviation Administration said Monday.
   Congress required the smoking ban on short flights in
legislation last year. The FAA issued its final rules on the
prohibition Monday, although the general outline of the new
restrictions has been known for months.
   Airlines since the first of the year have complied with a state
law in California and banned smoking on flights within the state.
   The law enacted by Congress last year prohibits smoking on any
flight of two hours or less on jet aircraft as well as smaller
commuter planes. Charter flights and those involving travel clubs
are exempt from the rules.
   The FAA, clarifying details of the restrictions, said Monday
that the length of the flight shall be determined by the elapsed
time shown for the flight in the Official Airline Guide. Should a
flight be delayed so it takes longer than two hours, the ban still
is in effect, the FAA said.
   The ban also will apply to each segment of a flight. For example
a flight that has three legs of 90 minutes, 90 minutes and 2{ hours
would require that smoking be prohibited in the first two segments
and allowed in the final segment, according to the FAA.
   According to the rules, flight attendants must remind passengers
of the smoking ban during pre-flight briefings.
   A passenger who violates the ban would face a civil fine of up
to $1,000 per offense. Any passenger who tampers with a smoke
detector in an aircraft lavatory and tries to smoke could face a
fine of up to $2,000.

<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie
told a gathering of the world's religious leaders and lawmakers on
Monday that environmental and political problems have imperiled the
Earth.
   ``We are confronted by problems which transcend national and
credal boundaries, which are urgent and potentially terminal, and
which require not less than a global solution,'' the archbishop
told the conference, which is debating global problems.
   ``We live in a world society which desperately seeks some
measure of world community in order to survive,'' said Runcie, the
spiritual head of the state Church of England and leader of 70
million Anglicans worldwide.
   In an apparent reference to the plight of hostages in the
hijacked Kuwaiti airliner in Cyprus, Runcie said one crisis that
had to be solved was the ``terrorism which fouls and feeds on
global communciation.''
   Runcie took part in the opening of the five-day Global
Conference of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival.
   Earlier Monday, the organizers said China pulled out of the
meeting, expressing displeasure at the attendance of the Dalai
Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibetan Buddhism.
   The conference is a gathering of the leaders of the world's
major religions and elected lawmakers and is aimed at putting their
influence to work on solving dilemmas such as over-population and
poverty.
   In a message of good wishes to the conference, Indian's Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi said, ``Those who guide the destinies of
spiritual affairs and those who forge the destinies of nations must
share the same vision for the betterment of humanity.''
   About the pulling out of the Chinese, the Very Rev. James Parks
Morton, a co-chairman of the conference, said: ``We worked hard to
get the Chinese here because we are discussing issues of great
concern to them, like population growth.''
   Morton, dean of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine
in New York City, said the leaders of the world's most populous
nation had earlier shown a willingness to attend the conference.
   ``But although we had no formal complaint from the Chinese
government about the attendance of the Dalai Lama, we did get a
letter from one of their bigwigs saying they were not coming
because he was here,'' Morton said.
   The Dalai Lama fled to exile in India in 1959 after China
invaded his country and has criticized China's policies in Tibet.
   The Dalai Lama is one of a dozen main speakers at the
conference. On Tuesday he will address the conference on the
universal human condition. He will not attend other sessions of the
gathering, which ends Friday.
   About 200 people from 60 countries in East and West, including
the Communist bloc, are attending the conference, with the five
main religions of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and
Judaism strongly represented.
   The meeting, apparently the first such religious-political
gathering, will discuss how the participants will work together to
influence crucial issues, which also include terrorism, urban
violence, pollution, conservation and education.

   Farmers, utilities and fish and game
officials will be fighting over limited water supplies this summer
as a major drought parches the West.
   ``That's the big concern, the juggling act with water,'' said
Mick Jennings, a fish biologist for the Oregon Department of Fish
and Wildlife in Central Point. ``There are so many interests in
water, what might be best for one interest may not be best for
another interest.''
   The Bonneville Power Administration quit selling power to
California last fall to make up for a drop in electricity produced
by hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River system.
   But the big victims of the drought will be farmers, ranchers and
fish, said Wally Gibson of the Northwest Power Planning Council.
``The problem is severe on the fish and irrigation side, not the
power side.''
   In California, San Joaquin County already has declared a drought
after noting snowpack and reservoir levels were approaching the
lows that preceded the drought of 1976-77.
   ``We've had a critical premature die-off of range land, and lots
of water districts are cutting back on farm water allotments,''
said Ron Baldwin, coordinator of the San Joaquin County Office of
Emergency Services.
   The snowpack in California averages 35 percent of normal,
forcing some ranchers to sell cattle and appeal for federal grain
subsidies as pastures dry up.
   ``It's scary. It's really scary,'' said Billy Marr, head of the
Tuolumne County Water System, in the Sierra Nevada, which is
considering rationing.
   The West isn't alone. In the Southeast, Georgia, Alabama and
South Carolina are facing their fourth serious drought in eight
years, with some reservoirs at lower levels than they were at this
point in the drought years of 1981, 1986 and 1987, officials said
earlier this month.
   ``If we don't get a dramatic increase in rainfall, we'll be
looking at water restrictions this summer,'' said David Word, chief
of water resource management for the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources.
   In Oregon, snowpack and rainfall figures range from near-normal
in the northwestern part of the state to 36 percent of normal in
the south.
   Ranchers in southeastern Oregon are trucking water to their
cattle as water holes dry up, said Jay Carr, an Oregon State
University Extension agent in Lakeview.
   Irrigation water will be in short supply for orchards, hopyards,
vineyards and livestock around Yakima, Wash., on the drier eastern
slopes of the Cascades.
   In Seattle, however, unusually heavy rain and snow in March
relieved fears of a second year of rationing. Reservoirs are up to
94 percent of normal.
   The outlook is grim in the region's forests, which were heavily
scarred by fires last summer.
   Southern Oregon's Siskiyou National Forest, where 110,000 acres
burned, already has started its fire season.
   ``Drought conditions don't guarantee a bad season,'' said Tim
Keith, who oversees southwest Oregon for the state Department of
Forestry. ``But they certainly elevate the potential.''
   Timber companies worked feverishly over the winter and spring to
stockpile logs.
   ``Companies are concerned that we'll have another serious fire
season and they'll be locked out of the woods again,'' said Ron
Johnson, timber staff coordinator for the U.S. Forest Service
regional office in Portland. Last summer, officials limited logging
in high danger areas of Oregon.
   The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife is particularly
worried about a disease called furunculosis killing off thousands
of chinook salmon on their spawning run up southern Oregon's Rogue
River.
   Low flows mean warmer water, which promote the growth of the
bacteria, said Jennings. Low water also makes it tougher for fish
to swim up rapids and falls, bottling them up in crowded pools
where the bacteria is more readily spread.
   Starting Friday, the Corps is to flush immense volumes of water
down the Columbia and Snake rivers to help young salmon smolts
migrate to the ocean. It also plans to use trucks and barges to
carry many smolts around dams, where they can be killed by
hydroelectric turbines or spillway torrents.
   The Northwest Power Planning Council is facing the prospect of
less hydroelectricity from the dams on the Columbia.
   ``If we have to buy hydropower from Canada or if we have to fire
up the coal plants in Oregon, which are far more expensive than our
hydropower, we are likely to see some rate increases,'' said
council spokeswoman Dulcy Mahar.

<HEAD>New Unit To Be Formed To Protect Cambodians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand is forming a new military unit
to protect Cambodian refugees after complaints that a paramilitary
task force had robbed, raped and killed refugees, an officer said
Monday.
   Col. Sanam Kajornklam of the Supreme Command's Operations
Division said the Displaced Persons Protection Unit would be
operating on the Thai-Cambodian border by the end of June.
   Sanan said international organizations and Western countries
that contribute to the Thai refugee relief effort had voiced
concern about abuses by Task Force 80, which since 1980 has been in
charge of security for a quarter million Cambodians in camps along
the border.
   The Cambodians fled brutal regimes, food shortages and a
guerrilla war in their homeland.
   The Western officials ``were concerned and said they would like
to see improvements,'' Sanan said. ``We also wanted to see changes
and are responding to that.''
   ``By improving our people and increasing our responsibilities,
we will be able to provide better security to those inside the
camps,'' Sanan said.
   He said the army chief, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, and the
armed forces chief of staff, Gen. Sundhara Kongsompong, concluded
in October that the paramilitary must be ``upgraded and staffed
with people with caliber.''
   The new unit, comprising 560 defense volunteers, is to work
together with the army and Task Force 80, Sanan said.
   The United States, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
voluntary organizations, and the Lawyers' Committee for Human
Rights were among those who complained about the task force.
   In an influential report issued in February 1987, a delegation
from the New York-based lawyers' committee said that its tour of
the border area found ``an alarming incidence'' of abuse by the
task force rangers.
   ``Rangers have robbed, beaten and raped the residents of some
camps, with apparent impunity,'' the report said. ``The rangers'
conduct has generated an atmosphere of fear even among those who
have not been personally victimized.''
   The rangers also have killed some refugees, the report said.
   One of the most publicized incidents took place in March 1986,
when three task force officers reportedly used a hot iron and
burning firewood to torture three Cambodians in the Khao-I-Dang
refugee camp, which is aided by the United Nations. The Cambodian
men were suspected of an armed raid on the camp.
   Thai government officials then denied there had been any torture.
   Western aid officials working on the border say that there have
been fewer reported abuses by task force rangers in recent months.

<TEXT>
   Premier-designate Ciriaco De Mita reached agreement
Monday night with his proposed coalition partners on the formation
of Italy's 48th postwar government.
   De Mita informed President Francesco Cossiga that he had
finished his consultations. But he told reporters he was not yet
ready to present his Cabinet list to the president.
   He said the five parties in the proposed coalition would hold
meetings Tuesday to discuss the agreement reached by the party
leaders Monday night.
   ``We have reached a complete accord,'' De Mita, the leader of
the dominant Christian Democrats, told reporters at the end of a
three-hour meeting with proposed coalition partners.
   His government also would include the Socialists, Republicans,
Social Democrats and Liberals _ the same parties that made up the
last government, headed by Premier Giovanni Goria.
   Goria resigned for a third time on March 11. Five days later,
Cossiga asked De Mita to try to form the next government.
   ``The negotiations were not difficult,'' said De Mita.
``Probably they were characterized by some delay and some
uncertainty. ... But I believe that it was a good job.''
   Bettino Craxi, leader of the Socialist Party and a former
premier, said, ``We have reached an agreement that tomorrow we will
present for the approval of the party.''
   De Mita did not say when he will meet with the president to
discuss his new Cabinet.
   After he formally presents his government to Cossiga, he will
offer it for a vote of confidence in both chambers of Parliament,
where the proposed coalition holds a comfortable majority.

<HEAD>FTC Reinstates Complaint That Cigarette Ad Was Deceptive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission on Monday revived
a complaint that an R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. advertisement in 1985
misrepresented the results of a government study on the effects of
smoking on health.
   In a 4-1 vote, the commission reversed a ruling made last August
by an administrative law judge who had dismissed the complaint on
grounds that the ad was an editorial and therefore was protected by
First Amendment guarantees on freedom of speech.
   Under Monday's FTC order, Montgomery K. Hyun, the administrative
law judge who dismissed the complaint, must reconsider his ruling
in light of Supreme Court criteria on determining whether an
advertisement is protected by the First Amendment, said Dee
Ellison, an FTC spokeswoman.
   Hyun must determine whether the five-member commission has
jurisdiction in the case, Ellison said.
   The FTC staff, in its original complaint filed in June 1986,
charged that R.J. Reynolds made false or misleading statements in
an advertisement, ``Of Cigarettes and Science,'' which ran from
March 1985 to June 1985 by stating that the study, ``provided
credible scientific evidence that smoking is not as hazardous as
the public or the reader has been led to believe.''
   The study, called Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, or MR
FIT, was conducted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
of the National Institutes of Health, said Ellison.
   The FTC complaint was based in part on the fact that ``Reynolds
failed to disclose in the ad that men in the study who quit smoking
had a significantly lower rate of death from heart disease than men
who continued to smoke,'' Ellison said. ``We charged that omission
of that information made the ad deceptive.''
   If the case is decided against Reynolds, the commission could
bar the tobacco company from misrepresenting scientific studies but
could not seek monetary penalties, Ellison said.
   The company views it as a freedom of speech case.
   Floyd Abrams, an attorney representing R.J. Reynolds, said the
company ``denies that it misrepresented the study. But the basic
issue here is who should decide that, the government or the public
as whole.''
   ``This advertisement is, in our view, protected by the same
First Amendment rights as if it were written by anyone in the
world,'' Abrams said.
   Abrams said that although R.J. Reynolds has not yet had a chance
to review the entire ruling, it will consider all its legal
options, including a possible appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals
in Washington, or asking the commission to stay further proceedings
on issue.
   Remanding to the case to the administrative law judge, said
Abrams, ``is unneccesary and in flat violation of the First
Amendment. One would not ask the writer or an op-ed piece why he
wrote it.''
   FTC chairman Daniel Oliver cast the single dissenting vote on
the case, agreeing with Reynolds that ``it is critical for First
Amendment purposes that the public, and not the government, decide
the answer to this question.''
   The Coalition on Smoking or Health, which had petitioned the FTC
to rule against the ad, applauded the new FTC ruling.
   Coalition chairman Scott D. Ballin said the decision means ``the
federal government has the power to prevent RJR or any company with
commerical motives from deliberately misleading consumers about the
safety of its products by discussing a made-up scientific
controversy through advertisements that look like editorials.''
   The coalition comprises the American Heart Association, the
American Lung Association and the American Cancer Society.
   R.J. Reynolds, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., sells 20 brands of
cigarettes and accounts for about one-third of the U.S. cigarette
market, according to company statistics.

   President Reagan on Monday directed Secretary
of State George P. Shultz to go to Geneva to sign ``historic
accords'' by which the United States and Soviet Union will
guarantee a peace agreement dictating the removal of all Red Army
troops from Afghanistan.
   Reagan called the pact a ``triumph'' for the U.S.-backed
insurgents after a bloody, eight-year war with the Soviet-supported
Kabul regime. He said the rebels ``can count on our continued
support.''
   The rebels have rejected the peace pact and have vowed to
continue fighting. Under a compromise with Moscow, the United
States will continue sending weapons to the rebels, while the
Kremlin continues providing arms to the Marxist government.
   Reagan made the announcement in the sun-splashed Rose Garden
before a ceremony to congratulate the mens' and womens' NCAA
basketball champions.
   ``This is the first time in the history of the Soviet Union that
they have moved by aggression into another country and then had to
withdraw,'' Shultz said later at a White House press briefing.
   The peace settlement, negotiated between Pakistan and
Afghanistan under the auspices of the United Nations, is to be
signed on Thursday.
   Shultz acknowledged that the removal of Soviet troops will not
necessarily mean an end to the fighting. Once the Red Army is
withdrawn, Shultz said, ``then the people of Afghanistan have got
to work things out. That's their right and their problem. ...
Perhaps we can get to a period of at least relative stability.''
   In the Rose Garden, a reporter shouted to Reagan that the rebels
feel they are being sold out by the United States and will not be
bound by the accord. ``We are not,'' Reagan replied.
   Beginning May 15, the Soviet Union is to begin withdrawing its
115,000 troops, with 50 percent of the forces removed over a
three-month period. All remaining Soviet forces are to be out by
Feb. 15, 1989.
   Shultz said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has
promised to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year, ahead
of the deadline. He said the United States will ``push for that and
expect that.''
   While hailing the agreement, Shultz said, ``the withdrawal of
Soviet troops is obviously not the end of the matter.''
Negotiations will continue for the establishment of an interim
government. ``We know it's not easy, it will be hard,'' Shultz said.
   He said the United States will help the rebels ``as needed.''
   But on Capitol Hill, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., denounced the
agreement as amounting to a ``slow-motion-sellout'' of the
resistance fighters.
   ``It's a poor deal, a very bad deal,'' he said. ``The Soviets
are perfectly free under this agreement to resupply the communist
puppet regime in Kabul just as lavishly as they please,'' while
denying the United States the right to resupply the Afghan rebels.
   The accord calls for the return to Afghanistan of millions of
Afghan refugees, most of whom moved to neighboring Pakistan.
   ``Undoubtedly there will be a massive movement of refugees from
outside Afghanistan into Afghanistan, by the millions,'' Shultz
said. ``So, there will be immense social dislocation and potential
for suffering, and we and others in the international community
will want to do everything we can to ease that transition,'' Shultz
said.
   The United States has urged the appointment of a special U.N.
coordinator to oversee the repatriation.
   ``In our view, the Soviet Union, having inflicted so much
suffering on the Afghan people, have a special obligation to
provide resources for this resettlement,'' Shultz said.
   Underscoring Reagan's pledge of continued aid for the rebels,
Shultz said, ``we have stood by the Afghan people during this 8{
years and we're prepared to stand by them in the coming months to
help Afghans return home and begin rebuilding their lives and their
country.''
   Reagan made the announcement after being briefed by Shultz on
details of the agreement.
   ``I believe the U.S. can now join the Soviet Union as a
guarantor of the Geneva instruments,'' Reagan said. ``I have
therefore asked Secretary Shultz to represent us at a signing
ceremony for the historic accords. ...
   ``This development would not have been possible had it not been
for the valiant struggle of the Afghan people to rid their country
of foreign occupation,'' Reagan said. ``We take great pride in
having assisted the Afghan people in this triumph and they can
count on our continued support.''

   The White House formally announced on Monday
that President Reagan intends to return Walter Leon Cutler to the
post of U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
   If he is confirmed, it will be Cutler's second term as
ambassador. Cutler, who had served as the U.S. representative in
Riyadh from 1984 to 1987, will replace Hume Horan in the position.
   Earlier this month, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
announced Horan was being reassigned after only six months on the
job.
   At that time, a State Department official who spoke on condition
of anonymity said Horan had a ``personality conflict'' with King
Fahd.
   Saudi and American officials denied a report that the Saudi
government had asked Horan be replaced. A U.S. official also denied
that Horan's reassignment was related to a U.S.-Saudi dispute over
that country's acquisition of missiles from China.
   In separate announcements, the White House said Reagan intends
to nominate Paul Taylor as ambassador to the Dominican Republic.
   Taylor, who has been deputy assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs since 1985, would succeed Lowell Kilday, the
White House said.
   Reagan also intends to nominate Rush Walker Taylor Jr. to be
ambassador to the Republic of Togo. Taylor, who has been serving as
the temporary charge d-Affaires in Guinea-Bissau since 1986, will
succeed David Korn, the White House said.

<TEXT>
   The world's oldest Olympic champion last
saw his two medals nearly 60 years ago. Somehow, says Abel Kiviat,
the gold and silver medals got misplaced and were never found.
   But this week, Kiviat, 95, who ran in the 1912 Stockholm games
and was the roommate of Jim Thorpe, will get duplicates of the
medals from the great-grandson of the man who presented him with
the originals.
   King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden is to present Kiviat with the
specially crafted medals Thursday during a visit to Trenton.
   Glenn Kasper, a member of the Governor's Council on Physical
Fitness, came up with the idea of replacing the original medals
after taking Kiviat home from an Olympic fund-raising event in
February.
   ``We were driving and my wife said, `Abel, where are your
Olympic medals?' He said, `To tell you the truth, I haven't seen
them in almost 60 years,''' Kasper said.
   ``I knew the king and queen were coming here and I thought,
`Wouldn't it be great if we could get replacement medals to give to
Abel?''' Kasper said.
   Within 10 days of contacting International Olympic Committee
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, Kasper had Samaranch's approval
and copies of the medals in hand.
   The duplicates were made by a Swiss company using the same molds
from which the 1912 medals were cast. The International Olympic
Committee picked up the cost.
   How the originals were lost is not entirely clear.
   Kiviat, who was not available for an interview Monday afternoon,
told Kasper that his family ``just misplaced them,'' possibly
during a move to a new home, Kasper said.
   In the 1912 Olympics, Kiviat won the silver medal in the
1,500-meter run and the gold medal in the 3,000-meter cross-country
event
   Kiviat later worked as a court clerk in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan before retiring. He now lives in the central New Jersey
community of Lakehurst and makes occasional appearances to generate
support for amateur athletics.
   ``We felt replacing Abel's medals would be a fitting gesture to
thank him for the support he has given the governor's council,''
said Ralph Dougan, executive director of the physical fitness
council.

   An ambitious plan to make Massachusetts the first
state to guarantee affordable child care for every child under 14
was unveiled Monday, although its sponsor said he didn't know how
it would be funded.
   ``We are in the midst of a child-care crisis,'' said state Rep.
David B. Cohen, co-chairman of a special child-care commission.
``It is a crisis which affects our children, our families and our
economy.''
   Cohen, chief sponsor of the bill to create a cabinet-level
Executive Office of Child Care to oversee and expand current
child-care services, said three out of five Massachusetts children
need child care because both their parents work or they have a
single parent who works.
   Currently, the state is providing services to about 80,000
children at an annual cost of $110 million, primarily through
subsidies to the poor, he said.
   But Cohen said conservative estimates point to another 80,000
children whose families cannot find child-care services and 80,000
more whose parents can't find services at a price they can afford.
   ``This crisis will only grow in the future,'' Cohen, joined by
other child care advocates, told a statehouse news conference.
   Cohen's bill doesn't say exactly how or when the state will meet
these needs.
   The measure would create a 21-member, gubernatorially appointed
advisory commission to counsel the child care secretary on how to
accomplish the mandate.
   He said the proposal could double or triple current state
spending on child-care programs, but added, ``The only thing that
will be more expensive is not providing universal child care.
Without it, we may find that our economic boom will go bust.''
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' administration has taken no position on
the proposal, which now goes before the Legislature's Human
Services Committee.
   Asked what the administration's initial reaction was, Cohen
said, ``Well, they broke out in a rash.'' But he said the
administration hasn't dismissed the idea.

   Police searched Monday for a murder
suspect who drove off in a prisoner transport van after his guards
went into a convenience store and left the keys in the ignition.
   Richard Lacy Letner Jr., charged in the torture-murder of nurse
Ivon Pontbriant of Visalia, Calif., kicked out a passenger-door
window in the back of the van and drove away in handcuffs Sunday
afternoon, said San Antonio police spokeswoman Sandy Perez.
   Letner, 27, drove about a block before using the keys to unlock
his shackles and then fleeing on foot. The suspect, who was
captured in Iowa and was being returned to California, was one of
nine prisoners in the van.
   Interstate Extraditions of Bloomington, Ill., was transporting
the men across the country. The private firm uses former law
enforcement officers to ferry 3,000 prisoners a year.
   ``I would certainly consider him very dangerous in light of the
escape and because the information from the (murder) case alludes
to that,'' Visalia police Sgt. John Gomes said of Letner.
   Jim Kuczek, chief executive officer of Interstate Extraditions,
said the prisoner van was en route to Silver City, N.M., before
going on to California, but came to Texas to make four more
prisoner pickup stops in Beeville and Lubbock.
   He declined to say if the two guards, with more than 20 years
combined law enforcement experience between them, would be
disciplined.
   ``Our procedures indicate that one of the officers should be
with the vehicle at all times and that the keys should not be left
in the vehicle,'' Kuczek said. ``They (officers) were saying that
they were hot and needed air and the prisoners wanted the air
conditioner to be left on.
   ``Letner must have been quite an acrobat. We have never had an
escape like that,'' he added.
   Shortly after the guards went into the store, Letner kicked out
a rear window and managed to drive the van about a block. He then
used other keys on the ring to unlock his handcuffs and shackles,
before abandoning the van, authorities said.
   None of the other prisoners left the van.
   Helicopters and dogs were used to search for Letner on Sunday,
Perez said, and an all-points bulletin was issued with Letner's
description.
   Ms. Pontbriant's body was found March 2 in her apartment with a
telephone cord wrapped around her neck and several stab wounds,
authorities said.
   Earlier that morning, Letner and another suspect, Christopher
Tobin, 26, had been found in the woman's car, but officials did not
know about the killing, Gomes said.
   About 20 hours later, authorities learned about the slaying and
linked Letner and Tobin to the killing, Gomes said.
   The suspects were arrested March 29 in Council Bluffs, Iowa,
Gomes said.
   Two Visalia police officers went to Iowa to pickup the
prisoners, but because of restrictions allowing only one prisoner
per flight, only Tobin was returned to Visalia, Gomes said.

   The most detailed assessment of the nation's
business schools in nearly 30 years found widespread complacency,
poor planning and a lack of contact with the business world.
   But the 372-page report, released Monday at a national
convention of business schools, drew immediate fire from deans and
corporate officials who said the report didn't go far enough in
addressing social and ethical issues, including minority
recruitment.
   ``While both corporate and academic leaders believe business
schools are performing reasonably well at present, they are in
danger of drifting casually toward the 21st century, without
careful thought and strategic planning about the roles their
graduates will play in the changing world of business,'' the study
said.
   It chided schools for preaching long-term planning in the
corporate world, but doing little planning themselves beyond the
next semester.
   Businesses, for their part, ``typically feel they can safely
ignore most business school research with impunity,'' the report
said.
   The report, ``Management Education and Development: Drift or
Thrust into the 21st Century,'' was commissioned by the American
Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, an accrediting body
whose 254 member schools award about 55 percent of all business
degrees awarded annually.
   The report was compiled by Lyman Porter and Lawrence McKibbin
after a three-year study of the nation's business schools. The
researchers interviewed deans, professors, placement directors and
others on 60 campuses, as well as chief executives, college
recruiters and those responsible for executive development from 50
private-sector organizations.
   In addition, the data includes results from 10,000 extensive
questionnaires mailed to a similar audience.
   ``I was disappointed that after three years of work, the
politics of an organization this large seems to have watered down
everything,'' said John Rosenblum, dean of the University of
Virginia's graduate school of business.
   ``It just wasn't strong enough,'' he added. ``I think one could
have left with the impression that we really are all right. I don't
think we're all right.''
   Porter, a professor at the Graduate School of Management at the
University of California at Irvine, said the report could not
answer all the concerns of the business or educational communities.
But after the research was complete, he said he was pleased to see
how well the corporations thought of the preparations for their
employees.
   ``The reactions from the business community were more positive
than we had anticipated,'' Porter said.
   McKibbin, a professor of management at the University of
Oklahoma, agreed.
   ``When we went in we expected to be tongue-lashed by our
colleagues in he corporate world,'' McKibbin said. ``That didn't
happen at all.'
   Bob Pike, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble, said the report
failed to address ``the diversity of our work force. We're looking
very carefully at things like the minority enrollments in business
colleges and other social issues. Our company and many major firms
are very concerned about these things.''
   The report concluded business schools were lax in forecasting
and meeting future trends in the business community.
   ``Complacency and self-satisfaction appear to be the dominant
attitudes in many schools,'' Porter and McKibbin reported. ``There
is little perceived need for major changes in the way in which
collegiate management education is carried out.''
   ``This is our opportunity to see that and change our
complacency,'' said Richard Lewis, dean of the business school at
the University of Michigan. ``This could be the single, most
important factor coming out of the study.''
   Since the last major study of business schools in 1959 by
Stanford University business Professor James Howell, the number of
bachelor's degrees in business increased from 50,000 to about
250,000 in 1985, and master's degrees increased from 5,000 to
60,000.
   The study cites the need for improved communication between
business and business schools, greater program diversity among the
schools, more varied and generalized curriculum at each school and
greater planning for life-long executive education.
   Corporations surveyed seemed reasonably satisfied with the job
business schools are doing preparing future employees. But the
report said ``managers and executives would like to see more
`realistic, practical, hands-on' education with greater emphasis on
behaviorally oriented subject matter in the curriculum and the
development of `people' skills.'''

   Two stars from Leningrad's Kirov Ballet will

   Mikhail Baryshnikov, the ABT's artistic director, said Monday
that Altynai Assylmuratova and Faruk Ruzimatov will perform in ``La

from the Kirov in 1970, choreographed the full-length ballet for
the ABT.
   Baryshnikov, a Kirov dancer when he defected in Canada in 1974,
met with Kirov artistic director Oleg Vinogradov last December in

   King Carl Gustaf XIV and Queen Silvia of
Sweden posed Monday in front of an oil painting of their family as
they toured an exhibition of masterpieces from the Gripsholm Castle.
   The royal couple previewed the 60-piece exhibit at the National
Portrait Gallery in advance of the formal opening Wednesday. Their
family portrait, painted by John-Erik Franzen in 1985, is one of
the 4,000 works at Gripsholm Castle which is Sweden's national
portrait museum.
   The king and queen arrived in Washington on Sunday to
participate in events around the country marking the 350th
anniversary of the first Swedish colony in America. From here they
will travel Wednesday to Wilmington, Del., the site of the first
colony, which was subsequently captured by the Dutch and then the
British.
   The king toured the National Air and Space Museum, and the
monarchs hosted a reception at the Swedish ambassador's residence.
They also were scheduled to dine at the White House with President
Reagan and his wife Nancy.
   Reporters were given a preview of another exhibit marking the
350th anniversary, this one at the National Gallery. The royal
couple will be on hand for the formal opening on Tuesday of the
decorative art show ``Sweden: A Royal Treasury 1550-1700.''
   Among the exhibits are the Swedish crown jewels, a selection of
armor and weapons, the wedding costume of Gustavus Adolphus and the
elaborate velvet gown worn by 4-year-old Charles XI when he became
king.
   These are among 100 objects, never before shown in the United
States, which will be on display in the gallery's East Building
until Sept. 5. Then they will go to the Institute of Arts at
Minneapolis, Minn., where many immigrants from Sweden settled. They
will be on view there from Oct. 9 to Jan. 1, 1989..
   ``The baroque period in Sweden is largely unfamiliar to the
American public, and we expect this exhibition to open up a
fascinating area of European history to this country,'' J. Carter
Brown, director of the National Gallery said.
   The exhibit has been supported by contributions from the Boeing
Company, the Federation of Swedish Industries and the Swedish
government.

<HEAD>Writers Bellow And Terkel Talk To Radio Audience In Kiev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authors Saul Bellow and Studs Terkel talked
Monday about a familiar topic, writers and writing, but to an
unfamiliar audience _ a big chunk of their listeners will tune in
on radios in the Soviet Union.
   The topic was ``glasnost''_ the new policy of openness promoted
by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev _ and how writers might help
foster greater understanding between their two countries.
   The program, originating live on public radio WBEZ in Chicago
with panelists commenting by telephone from Kiev, was recorded for
broadcast sometime later this week in that city in the Soviet
Ukraine.
   ``I think we can say the Cold War days have basically had it,''
said Terkel, the Chicago-based author and interviewer known for
such books as ``Working'' and ``The Good War.''
   ``I'm happy to say that a recent poll ... revealed that the
American people think drugs is the biggest fear and not communism.
It shows there is more curiosity than antipathy when the Soviet
Union is mentioned today,'' he said.
   Panelists in Kiev and Chicago lauded the more tolerant attitude
towards art and artists in the Soviet Union.
   But Alexi Gubenko, chief correspondent for Radio Kiev, opened
the 75-minute program with an apology to Bellow, the Nobel and
Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist whose works have not been ranslated
into Russian.
   ``I can say the ice has already melted in many ways ... Yet, it
is very sad that such distinguished writers as Mr. Bellow are not
available at this time,'' Gubenko said.
   ``I met Mr. Gorbachev at the White House recently,'' Bellow
said, ``but I didn't get a chance to ask him about it.''
   On a more serious note, Bellow noted that proposed cultural
exchanges of the past had promised more than they'd delivered. The
author of ``The Adventures of Augie March,'' and most recently,
``More Die of Heartbreak,'' added he hoped ``that wouldn't be the
case with glasnost.''
   Soviet writer and critic Ivan Drach said from Kiev that the
profusion of literary journals in Kiev alone, and the freedom to
publish works that had been banned for years, suggested glasnost
would lead to fundamental changes in Soviet life.
   `Indeed, we said too many sweet words about our past reality,''
Drach said through a translator. ``The problems have been raised,
the problems are many, but at last they are being discussed.''

<HEAD>Improved Soybean Exports Lifting Market Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improved soybean exports are helping lift
market prices this season, an Agriculture Department analysis
showed Monday.
   Drought has damaged Brazil's soybean crop, and the European
Economic Community has increased its demand for the oilseed, the
department's Economic Research Service said. That has helped
whittle down U.S. soybean stockpiles and boost prices.
   The supply-and-demand report said soybean prices now could
average in the range of $5.50 to $5.80 per bushel in the marketing
year that began last Sept. 1, up from $5.35 to $5.75 forecast in
March. Prices averaged $4.78 per bushel in the 1986-87 season.
   Soybean exports were forecast at 785 million bushels, up from
760 million indicated last month and the 757 million bushels
shipped in 1986-87.
   Wheat exports also have improved, due mainly to subsidized sales
to the Soviet Union under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   In all, exports in the wheat marketing year that runs through
May 31 are estimated at 1.6 billion bushels, a 60 percent increase
from 1 billion bushels shipped in 1986-87. Average market prices
for this season were put at $2.55 per bushel, up from $2.42 last
year.
   Corn exports also are up, rising to an estimated 1.7 billion
bushels in the corn marketing year that began last Sept. 1,
compared with 1.5 billion bushels in 1986-87.
   Market prices of corn were forecast to average $1.65 to $1.85
per bushel this season, up from $1.50 in 1986-87.

   William Styron has been named the
recipient of the 1988 Edward MacDowell Medal for his lifetime
achievements as a writer, a spokeswoman for the MacDowell Colony
for artists said Monday.
   Styron is being recognized for his novels, articles and essays,
including the 1967 book ``The Confessions of Nat Turner,'' which
won a Pulitzer Prize, and ``Sophie's Choice,'' which won the
American Book Award in 1980.
   ``We will honor William Styron for his contribution to American
literature and for his unique insight and vision of the American
novel,'' said Mary Carswell, the colony's executive director.
   ``Through his works, he has helped us understand man's
limitations. He has taught us lessons about the human condition,
about how to survive, about right and wrong.''
   Styron was chosen by a committee of seven American literary
figures. It was chaired by John Updike, a former MacDowell
medalist, and included Michael Blumenthal, Brendan Gill, Elizabeth
Hardwick, Norman Mailer, Elizabeth Sifton and Robert Taylor.
   Updike will present the medal to Styron and writer George
Plimpton also will speak at a ceremony Aug. 21 at the MacDowell
Colony, a retreat for artists founded in 1907 by composer Edward
MacDowell and his wife, Marian.
   Styron is the 29th recipient of the MacDowell Medal. Past
medalists include writers Thornton Wilder, Eudora Welty and Lillian
Hellman; composers Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein and William
Schuman; and visual artists Georgia O'Keeffe, Willem de Kooning and
Louise Nevelson.

<HEAD>Private Gifts To Colleges Surge To Record $8.5 Billion In 1986-87</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Private gifts to the nation's colleges and
universities rose a record $1.1 billion to $8.5 billion in 1986-87,
boosted by a sharp increase in alumni contributions, according to
an annual survey.
   For the second straight year, Stanford University was the most
successful fund-raiser with $198.5 million, topping Harvard
University which raised $178 million.
   The 1986-87 survey results gathered by the Council for Aid to
Education were projected from data reported by 1,174 colleges and
universities which together account for about 85 percent of all
private giving to higher education.
   Council president John R. Haire said several factors explain the
unusual rise in contributions. The percentage of the population
with four years or more of college doubled since 1970, meaning more
people were in a position to give.
   Colleges were more aggressive in making their case for
donations, Haire added. And the stock market was still booming in
1986-87.
   Among the survey findings:
   _Support from all sources reached $8.5 billion, up 14.9 percent
from the $7.4 billion raised in 1985-86.
   _Alumni donations showed the largest year-to-year increase, up
28.5 percent to $2.34 billion.
   Among other donor groups, non-alumni individuals contributed
$2.06 billion, up 16 percent; corporations gave $1.8 billion, up
$6.9 percent; foundations gave $1.5 billion, up 11 percent;
religious organizations donated $204 million, a 3.3 percent
decrease, and contributions from other sources rose 6.6 percent to
$552 million.
   _Following Stanford and Harvard, other top fund-raisers were
Cornell University, $149.7 million; Yale University, $120.1
million; University of Minnesota, $116.3 million; Washington
University (St. Louis), $110.4 million; Columbia University, $104.6
million; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, $101.4 million;
Johns Hopkins University, $92.6 million; and the University of
Southern California, $91.2 million.

   An apparent prank has forced the presidential
campaign of Gov. Michael Dukakis to disconnect its toll-free
nationwide telephone number, an aide said Monday.
   Dukakis fell victim to an unidentified person who placed
classified advertisements in more than a half dozen big-city daily
newspapers. The ads purported to be recruiting electricians and
helpers, but each one listed the 800 telephone number used by
Dukakis' national campaign headquarters in Boston.
   ``It's a lame joke at the expense of people who are out of work
and looking for a job,'' campaign spokesman Steve Akey said. ``We
received numerous calls.''
   Akey added that the campaign reluctantly canceled the number
last week and has no plans to request a new 800 number which, he
said, would be equally vulnerable to sabotage.

   A Manhattan lawyer charged Monday that he was
beaten without cause by a U.S. Secret Service agent traveling in a
motorcade with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Albert Gore
Jr.
   An official of the service maintained that the agent appeared to

front'' of a Secret Service car.
   But Gorayeb said he was crossing the street legally when he was
nearly struck by a Secret Service car and then ``brutally beaten
without provocation'' by an agent.
   Richard Ward, head of the Secret Service's New York office, said
Gorayeb ``obstructed the motorcade. An agent went out to talk to
him. An altercation ensued and he was arrested for assaulting a
federal agent.''
   Federal prosecutors declined to file charges against Gorayeb,
but an investigation is continuing, according to U.S. Attorney

<HEAD>Top Democrats: Dukakis, Jackson Can't Win South Carolina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Democratic presidential ticket headed by
Massachussets Gov. Michael Dukakis or native son Jesse Jackson has
little chance of winning in South Carolina, top state Democrats
believe.
   ``To carry South Carolina, we'd need a conservative Southern
Democrat on the ticket,'' said U.S. Rep. Robin Tallon of Florence.
``We haven't been successful except once, in the past five
elections, so I don't see us doing much worse.''
   State House Speaker Bob Sheehan, D-Kershaw, said a ticket with
Jackson or Dukakis ``will not do very well with the general public
in the state'' because neither ticket would be ``nearly as centrist
or conservative as South Carolina is.''
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings said he will support the Democratic
ticket regardless of who is on it, but wasn't enthusiastic about
current prospects.
   ``I'm not gung ho for anybody who's against our position in
Central America, and I'm not going to work hard for anybody who
believes in Cuba and Castro,'' Hollings said.
   Hollings said he is uncomfortable with Dukakis' views as well as
Jackson's. ``I've got a problem with both of them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Arab-American supporters of Jesse Jackson
splintered bitterly Monday over the Democratic presidential
hopeful's latest comments on the Middle East, with one group asking
why he had chosen to ``abandon your principles.''
   ``Your comments in New York have the appearance of tailoring
your positions on critical issues to suit the narrow political
views of powerful special interest groups,'' said Abdeen Jabara,
president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, in a
letter to Jackson.
   But James Zogby, executive director of the Arab-American
Institute, said suggestions that Jackson has shifted are ``grossly
exaggerating'' what happened.
   ``One can't erase a nine-year commitment to Palestinian rights
and to peace and justice for both Israelis and Palestinians in just
one day,'' Zogby said in a statement issued by his office.
``Arab-Americans in New York and across the nation are strongly
committed to Jackson's campaign.''
   The institute also released a statement from Edward Said, a
Columbia University professor. Said is a member of the Palestine
National Council _ often called the political wing of the PLO _ and
met with Secretary of State George Shultz in a controversial
Washington session last month.
   ``I feel that Rev. Jackson remains the only presidential
candidate responsive to Arab and Palestinian concerns. He has never
backed away from defending the rights of the Palestinian people,
whom he described this morning as `sovereign,''' Said said.
   Jackson has long been outspoken about a need to meet the
Palestinians' needs in any Middle East peace agreement. And
Arab-Americans have provided money and votes to his 1984 and 1988
campaigns.
   On Sunday, Jackson seemed to distance himself from the Palestine
Liberation Organization and he said that, as president, he would
not sit down with PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
   ``We must not equate Arafat and the PLO with a sovereign people,
the Palestinian people,'' he said.
   Asked on Monday to expand that stand, Jackson said:
   ``It would not be a good approach to start at the table with the
most extreme elements. That's a formula for catastrophe.''
   Jabara said in his letter that Jackson is pandering to Jewish
voters in the April 19 New York primary.
   ``On behalf of tens of thousands of Arab-Americans, I wish to
express my sadness that you felt the need to abandon your
principles in your campaign for public office,'' Jabara wrote.
``Virtually every Arab-American looked to you as the one symbol of
strength in a field of political candidates who are notorious for
their unwillingness to stand up to the pro-Israel lobby.''
   In particular, Jabara said the PLO is the spokesman for the
Palestinians.
   ``You know full well that virtually all Palestinians regard the
PLO as their sole legitimate representative,'' he said. ``Your
attempts to distinguish the PLO from the Palestinian people will
not improve your position with Jewish voters in New York, but will,
sadly, raise questions among your traditional supporters as to your
willingess to stand firm on principle.''

<TEXT>
   Spice imports totaled about $439 million last
year, up 12 percent from 1986, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   The rise was due mainly to larger imports of vanilla beans,
white pepper, nutmeg and mace, cassia, cumin, anise, capsicum
peppers, laurel and thyme, the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service reported. Higher prices of many of the items also were a
factor.
   ``Saffron prices have soared in recent months, reflecting a
short Spanish crop,'' the report said.
   Also, it added, cesium contamination from the Soviet Union's
nuclear mishap at Chernobyl two years ago ``has kept supplies tight
and prices firm for several Mediterranean-area herbs such as
oregano, laurel, rosemary and sage.''

   The region's forests, already heavily scarred by fires last
summer, are bracing for fire season. Last summer, officials limited
logging in Oregon forests where the fire danger was high, so timber
companies have been stockpiling logs through the winter and spring,
pushing up prices in the process.

   A bacterial disease called furunculosis could kill thousands of
spring chinook salmon on their spawning run up southern Oregon's
Rogue River.
   Low water flows mean higher water temperatures, which promote
the growth of the bacteria. Low water also makes it tougher for the
fish to swim up rapids and falls, bottling them up in crowded pools
where the bacteria is more readily spread.

   Rain fell from the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern
Atlantic states on Monday, and cold rain fell over Arkansas and
northern Mississippi, with some snow in higher elevations of
western Arkansas.
   Thunderstorms broke out around Georgia. Thunderstorms produced
golfball-size hail at Peachtree City, just south of Atlanta.
Quarter-size hail piled up 3 inches deep at Forsyth, in central
Georgia.
   Smaller hail was reported at a number of locations in eastern
Alabama and Georgia and northwestern South Carolina.
   Savannah, Ga., got 0.71 of an inch of rain in one hour during an
afternoon thunderstorm.
   Temperatures were only in the 40s when scattered rain fell in
Arkansas, northern Louisiana and northern Mississippi. Jackson,
Miss., reported a temperature of just 45 degrees at 3 p.m. EDT.
   The higher elevations of western Arkansas got more snow, with 3
inches on the ground on the top of Rich Mountain, at an elevation
of 2,800 feet.
   A freeze warning was posted overnight for the Hill Country of
south-central Texas.
   Elsewhere, light snow also was reported at Eastport, Maine,
during the afternoon.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Hyannis, Mass., to 94 at Thermal, Calif. The low for the
day was 7 degrees above zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Tuesday, showers and a few thunderstorms were forecast from
Mississippi and Tennessee across the central and southern
Appalachians to the Carolinas and Georgia.
   Highs in the 40s or 50s were predicted in New England; in the
50s in parts of Mississippi, the southern Appalachians, the middle
Atlantic states and the Great Lakes region; in the 80s in
southwestern Texas and interior California; in the 80s and 90s in
the desert Southwest; and in the 60s or 70s across most of the

<TEXT>
   Scientists are looking at the neem tree of
Asia and Africa as a possible source of material to prevent the
formation of aflatoxin, a naturally occurring food toxin, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Aflatoxin can be produced by fungi that form on some farm crops,
including corn and oilseeds. Laboratory tests with animals have
shown that aflatoxin is among the most powerful cancer-causing
agents known, and USDA has called it a ``potential'' hazard to
humans.
   USDA scientist Deepak Bhatnagar said that as a child in India
his parents often put leaves of the neem tree inside containers of
wheat to keep insects from the grain. Now he has found that the
leaves also may block fungi from producing aflatoxin.
   In tests at the department's Agricultural Research Service
center in New Orleans, Bhatnagar made solutions containing neem
leaves. He found that the solutions didn't kill the fungi but did
block more than 98 percent of the aflatoxin they normally would
have produced.
   The fungi that produce the toxin are Aspergillus flavus and A.
parasiticus.
   Bhatnagar said the results were ``promising but preliminary''
and that greenhouse studies with cotton are now being planned.
   The ornamental neem is also known as margosa and nim. More than
80 insect pests, including Mexican bean beetles, Colorado potato
beetles, tobacco budworms and carpet beetles, are repelled by neem
extracts.

<TEXT>
   An experimental program using herbicides to
destroy coca plants is bringing good results and may prove a major
weapon against cocaine trafficking, U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese said Monday.
   ``Peru has been one of the leaders in the use of herbicides for
eradicating coca plants. We have been cooperating with Peru in
these experimental studies,'' Meese said at a news conference.
   He later flew to Santa Cruz, Bolivia, the last stop on his
weeklong tour of Latin American countries where drug trafficking is
a major problem. His three-day visit to Bolivia will include a trip
to the cocaine-producing lowlands of the Chapare region.
   Meese said he agreed with Peruvian officials that no herbicide
should be used on a large scale if it causes ecological damage.
   ``Early results have indicated the development of a herbicide
that does not harm other plants,'' Meese said, without providing
details.
   The pilot project using herbicides may eventually replace the
system of manually uprooting the plants. The U.S. Embassy said
Washington is paying for the experiment.
   Meese arrived in Peru on Saturday and toured the Huallaga Valley
on Sunday.
   The valley, located on the jungle-cloaked eastern slopes of the
Andes, is the center of coca leaf growing in Peru. U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration officials say more than 60 percent of
the world's coca is grown in Peru.
   In the past year the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group, has
agreed to protect cocaine traffickers in the valley in exchange for
a share of the drug barons' multimillion dollar earnings.
   Meese flew low over the valley to observe coca plots, and
officials traveling with him said he expressed amazement at the
number of clandestine airstrips and jungle clearings where coca
grows.
   Peruvian anti-drug police have blown up more than 170 airstrips
since 1985, but most have been repaired in a matter of days by drug
traffickers.
   More than 250,000 Peruvians live by growing coca and processing
the leaves into semi-refined cocaine.
   The coca paste is refined into pure cocaine in Colombia and
smuggled to the United States and Europe.
   Meese began his tour in the Dominican Republic last Wednesday
and visited Colombia and Ecuador before arriving in Peru.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday ordered presidential
assailant John W. Hinckley Jr. to be questioned in a deposition
prior to a civil trial arising from the 1981 shooting of President
Reagan.
   U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn approved a motion by
lawyers representing White House press secretary James S. Brady and
two other people wounded in the March 30, 1981, shooting to
question Hinckley before the case goes to trial later this month.
   The trial of the multimillion-dollar lawsuits brought by Brady,
retired Washington policeman Thomas K. Delahanty and Secret Service
agent Timothy J. McCarthy is scheduled to begin April 26 before
Penn.
   Hinckley, who was confined to St. Elisabeths mental hospital
here following his 1982 acquittal by reason of insanity of
attempted murder charges, has asked to attend the trial, which
could last several days.
   Penn said at a hearing that he has made arrangements with the
U.S. Marshals Service for Hinckley to be present.
   Brady, who was shot in the head, was left permanently crippled.
Delahanty, who was shot in the back, was forced to retire from the
police force because of his medical disability.
   McCarthy was hospitalized for several weeks after a bullet was
surgically removed from his abdomen.
   The defense claims that Hinckley cannot be held liable for
damages because he was insane at the time of the shooting.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III asked his
longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach, if he was interested in taking
a key Justice Departent post a week or so before being notified
formally that Wallach was under criminal investigation in the
Wedtech scandal, a lawyer for Meese said Monday.
   Meese and Wallach conducted job talks concerning the then-vacant
post of counselor to the attorney general in ``limited discussions
held in late March or early April'' 1987, Meese attorney James
Rocap said.
   ``Meese recalls that he was clearly interested in having Bob
Wallach at that time come into the department, but that no formal
offer was ever advanced to him,'' Rocap said.
   The arrangement between the two men was that ``Wallach had to
make some decisions about what he wanted to do, whether he was
interested in'' the Justice Department position, said Rocap, adding
that Wallach was ``to get back'' to Meese. But that never took
place because the criminal investigation of Wallach intervened.
   The $77,500-a-year job of counselor is a position traditionally
held by one of the most trusted advisers to an attorney general.
   Rocap said he does not know whether Meese or Wallach initiated
the job talks or how many there were.
   Meese is on a trip to South America this week and was not
immediately available for comment.
   Around April 8, 1987, the attorney general was notified formally
under an administrative mechanism involving the FBI that Wallach
had become a subject of the criminal investigation into
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   Rocap characterized as ``ridiculous, unbelievable'' suggestions
by columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak that Meese had
considered the idea of bringing Wallach into the Justice Department
``to be a live possibility'' until last December when Wallach was
indicted in the Wedtech scandal.
   ``When Mr. Meese was told that Wallach had become a subject of
the investigation in April, that intervening event terminated
essentially any substantive discussions of any kind'' between the
two men, Rocap said.
   Rocap also said Meese and Wallach considered installing Wallach
on an advisory commission of outside experts in 1985 to examine the
administration of the Justice Department and suggest possible
changes. The commission, apparently the idea of Meese and Wallach,
was never created.
   The counselor's job was vacant after T. Kenneth Cribb Jr., a
member of Meese's inner circle of conservative advisers, went to
the White House early in March 1987 to handle the transition of
incoming chief of staff Howard Baker. Cribb is now assistant to the
president for domestic affairs.
   The Justice Department counselor's post was filled last May 18
by Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, head of
the department's civil rights division.
   After being notified officially in early April that Wallach, a
San Francisco lawyer and longtime friend, was under investigation,
Meese removed himself from involvement in the Wedtech inquiry,
which was being conducted by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani of New
York.
   However, Giuliani's investigation had been under way since the
previous fall amid widespread public attention to the fact that
Wallach had done work for the company. It was common knowledge at
the Justice Department in Washington late in 1986 that Wallach, who
had received $1.3 million from Wedtech, would shortly become the
focus of criminal investigators.
   Rocap said, however, that ``as of the time of these discussions
with Wallach, it was Mr. Meese's understanding that Wallach's role
in the investigation was simply as a witness.'' Meese ``had no
reason to believe that Mr. Wallach had been engaged in any kind of
impropriety'' in late March or early April 1987, said Rocap.
   A federal grand jury which indicted Wallach alleged that he and
Meese's financial manager, Wedtech consultant W. Franklyn Chinn,
had funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments from the
Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor in an attempt to influence Meese
and other public officials to help the company.
   Rocap represents Meese in the 11-month-old criminal
investigation of the attorney general's involvement with Wedtech
and other matters, including a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline in
which Wallach represented one of the partners.
   At Wallach's behest, Meese when he was White House counselor
intervened on behalf of Wedtech in its efforts to win a $32 million
no-bid contract from the Army. Wedtech got the contract in 1982
after a crucial White House meeting called by Meese's deputy.
   At a trial last October of two Maryland politicians stemming
from the Wedtech scandal, Mario Moreno, a former Wedtech executive
and government witness, testified that he had illegally paid
advances to Wallach in 1985 in anticipation that Wallach would take
a top Justice Department post.
   ``In one occasion he (Wallach) told me that he would become the
attorney general's chief of staff and that therefore we should make
certain payments ahead of time so that while he was there he would
continue to help the company,'' Moreno testified, saying that there
were several such payments to Wallach.

Policy Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 Chinese studying in the United
States, Canada and Switzerland have signed a letter to their
government opposing a plan to cut the number of students abroad, a
student organizer said Monday.
   The letter, which was a revised version of a petition prepared
two weeks ago, was delivered to Chinese officials on Sunday.
   A spokesman at the Chinese Embassy in Washington said the letter
was an ``inappropriate'' way to express discontent.
   He denied that China's policy of sending students abroad would
change.
   According to official reports in the Chinese press and a Chinese
document seen in New York, China will let 3,000 students leave
China this year. Of them, 600 will be sent to the United States.
   Last year, 8,000 Chinese students came to the United States
alone. In all, 40,000 Chinese students are studying worldwide,
about 27,000 of them in America.
   The embassy spokesman on Monday confirmed the existence of the
document but said China was ``using it only as a test.''
   ``We may change this document after using it for a couple of
months,'' he said.
   Boston University history professor Merle Goldman said the new
policy was aimed at limiting the West's influence on China.
   The students' letter urged the Beijing government to continue
China's ``open door'' policy, started by Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping in 1979.
   The policy seeks to improve China's economy by opening it to the
West.
   The letter also demanded that Chinese citizens be given the
``fundamental right'' to study wherever they wish for as long as
they wish.
   ``The recent unreasonable changes in the policies on overseas
study are fundamentally in conflict with the declared national
policy of reform and open door,'' the letter said.
   A Chinese student organizer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said 2,132 Chinese students from 141 research
institutions and universities in 38 American states had signed the
letter.
   Several students from Canada and Switzerland also signed the
petition, he said, although he did not specify the number.
   Of the signatories, 1,279 provided their real names, an act Ms.
Goldman described as ``courageous.''
   ``The students could be subject to reprisals once they return
home,'' she said. ``They could lose good jobs, even their relatives
could suffer.''
   The letter marked the second time Chinese students in the United
States have banded together to oppose policy changes in Beijing.
   In January 1987, more than 1,000 students signed a letter to the
Beijing government criticizing a crackdown on their fellow students
in China who had demonstrated for democracy in late 1986.
   Of those students, 482 signed their real names.
   Chinese students said most of those who signed the letters
ranged from their late 20s to their mid-40s, the generation raised
during China's ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, which lasted from
1965 to 1975.
   Ms. Goldman said this was significant because it showed the
affect that decade had on many Chinese.
   ``Mao Tse-tung taught them to criticize and question everything
and that's what they're doing,'' she said.

<HEAD>Amnesty To Be Extended to Aliens Who Overstayed Visas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Monday that it will
immediately begin accepting applications for amnesty from illegal
aliens who overstayed their student and tourist visas.
   Until further notice, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
also said it will defer the fee for such applications and issue a
temporary work authorization card, in accordance with a court
directive.
   The action is in response to a decision by U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin. Sporkin ruled March 30 that the Reagan
administration must broaden its standard for determining whether
illegal aliens who had overstayed tourist and student visas can
obtain amnesty under the 1986 immigration law.
   Last week, Sporkin directed INS to accept the applications
without the customary $185 individual filing fee.
   INS regulations originally stipulated that non-immigrant aliens
who overstayed their tourist or student visas must demonstrate that
any violation of their immigration status had come to the attention
of the INS before Jan. 1, 1982, for them to qualify for the amnesty
program.
   In a ruling on a class-action suit, Sporkin said the regulation
was too restrictive and declared that Congress intended the law to
mean that any government record, such as tax or Social Security
documents, could be used to document that an illegal alien was
known to federal authorities as of Jan. 1, 1982.
   Immigration experts say the clarifications affect at least
50,000 people.
   Under the 1986 immigration law, illegal aliens who have been in
the country at least since Jan. 1, 1982, may qualify for legalized
status. A 12-month application period for the amnesty program is
due to expire May 4.

   An Air Force reconnaissance jet slammed
into a row of mini-warehouses Monday moments after its two crew
members ejected from the cockpit and parachuted to the ground,
officials said.
   The crash ignited a fire in the warehouses about one mile from
Bergstrom Air Force Base, but there were no injuries on the ground,
said Austin Fire Chief Bill Roberts.
   Col. Roger Grimsley, 47, of Leesburg, Ohio, and Capt. Terence
Ganiko, 30, of Honolulu, were taken to a Bergstrom hospital for
treatment, said Lt. David Fruck, an Air Force public information
officer. Grimsley was pilot of the RF-4C Phantom II plane. Ganiko
was its weapons officer.
   Air Force officials did not release any information about the
crew members' condition Monday.
   The airplane, a reconnaissance version of the F-4C fighter, was
stationed at Bergstrom and was returning from a ``low-level
training mission'' when it crashed at 12:17 p.m, Fruck said.
   Lynn McDonald, manager of the mini-warehouse complex, said her
husband and another person were at the location when the plane
crashed but were not hurt.
   Mrs. McDonald said she saw the crash from her car, several
blocks away.
   ``I saw an airplane coming down, and I knew it was in this area.
All I could think was, `Thank God I'm not there,''' she said,
adding, ``I had an angel on my shoulder.''
   Manuel Coy, who lives in a nearby residential area in southeast
Austin, said he saw the plane burst into flames in the air as he
walked to a store.
   ``It kind of like turned, and the back end exploded and we saw
those two dudes jump out. The airplane kept on going. It kept on
going lower and lower after they jumped out,'' he said.
   Fire Department Lt. Larry Brown said the wreckage was scattered.
   ``As far as I can see, the aircraft is in several small pieces,
a lot of small pieces,'' he said.
   Fruck said the Air Force would convene a board of officers to
investigate.

   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore on
Monday began a five-day visit to Washington that will include talks
with President Reagan and U.S. editors critical of Singapore's
press restrictions.
   The State Department described Lee's Washington stay as a
private visit, but officials of both countries said the 63-old
leader would meet Secretary of State George Shultz Tuesday and
lunch Wednesday with Reagan at the White House.
   On Thursday, Lee is scheduled to address both the American
Society of Newspaper Editors and the Asia Society.
   ASNE leaders in recent years have criticized Singapore's
restrictions on the circulation of foreign publications, ordered on
grounds that their articles amount to interference in domestic
politics. Publications hit with restrictions at various times have
included the Asian Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine and the Far
Eastern Economic Review.
   The Singapore Foreign Ministry said in January press freedom in
Singapore should not be expected to meet the ``free and
unrestricted'' standards of United States.
   Meetings were also scheduled with members of Congress.
   House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Dante Fascell,
D-Fla., joined 50 other lawmakers in a joint letter last year
protesting the Lee government's use of preventive arrest without
trial of people suspected of subversion.
   Trade was another likely issue in Lee's talks. Singapore, a
newly-industrialized and affluent country with a growing trade
surplus with America, is facing loss of U.S. duty concessions
intended to promote development in poor countries.

   Charles Merrill Mount, 59, a Brooklyn native who sports the
accent and manners of a British gentleman, was convicted of
interstate transportation of stolen goods.
   He is scheduled to be sentenced in U.S. District Court May 23
and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. He was
released on $50,000 bail pending sentencing.
   Charles McGinty, Mount's public defender, said he will appeal on
grounds that the court should have paid transportation costs for
two Irish men Mount wanted as defense witnesses. Mount, whose
$18,400 in savings was seized by the government following the
arrest, claimed his status as indigent required prosecutors to pay
to bring witnesses to Boston.
   Mount, a respected art historian and former Guggenheim
Foundation fellow, claimed he owned the documents for years and
showed some of them to the two Irish men in the 1960s in Dublin.
   ``This was not a trial. It was only a hearing of government
allegations,'' Mount said after the verdict. ``A trial is when both
sides present their case. It did not happen here. ... The
government wanted a conviction and they got a conviction.''
   The jury deliberated four hours Friday and met for another 2{
hours Monday before returning the verdicts.
   Mount was accused of selling letters by artist James McNeill
Whistler, Winston Churchill and author Henry James, allegedly
belonging to the Library of Congress, to a Boston bookshop for
about $20,000 in July.
   He was arrested by FBI agents in August at the bookshop while
trying to sell letters and papers signed by Abraham Lincoln and
Civil War generals that allegedly were taken from the National
Archives.
   The government did not charge Mount with stealing the documents.
   Mount's only defense witness during the three-week trial was a
Nebraska woman who said she met Mount in an Ireland hotel in 1961
and saw some documents. She paid her own fare to Boston.
   Mount also has been indicted by a Washington grand jury on
charges of possession of federal property, but McGinty said he
would question whether Mount should face those charges following
his conviction on the transportation charges.
   Frank L. McNamara Jr., U.S. attorney in Boston, said he did not
know if federal prosecutors in Washington would pursue the
possession charges. Mount's court-appointed Washington counsel,
James Lyons, did not return phone calls.
   Mount, who changed his name from Stanley Merrill Suchow in the
1950s, said he will return to his room in a Washington boarding
house.

   The government withdrew thousands
of soldiers from the streets of the capital Monday and businesses
reopened for the first time after violent anti-U.S. demonstrations
last week.
   Restrictions imposed on two cities under a temporary state of
emergency remained in effect, but the government said the emergency
might be lifted later this week if no further trouble was reported.
   Protesters attacked and burned the U.S. Consulate Thursday night
after a Honduran man suspected of drug trafficking was arrested and
flown to the United States. Five Hondurans were killed in the
violence. The Honduran Constitution prohibits the extradition of
Honduran citizens.
   The state of emergency imposed Friday gave authorities the power
to ban public demonstrations and restrict freedom of movement in
the capital of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, 125 miles to the
north. The cities are the largest in Honduras.
   Many businesses closed Friday as students filled the street for
an anti-American demonstration. They remained shut Saturday as
thousands of police and soldiers patrolled the tense capital.
   Major Manuel Antonio Urbina, chief police spokesman, said
authorities had detained at least 70 people believed involved in
the attack on the embassy facilities.
   Military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
number of people arrested in connection with demonstrations and
looting could climb to 300 in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula.
   Thursday night's violence began during a student-led
demonstration against the April 5 arrest of Juan Ramon Matta.
   Honduran officials took Matta from his Tegucigalpa home in a
pre-dawn raid and hustled him onto a plane to the Dominican
Republic without a passport.
   Dominican Republic officials later put Matta on a New York-bound
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by U.S. marshals,
according to U.S. law enforcement officials.
   Matta, held at a maximum-security federal prison in Marion,
Ill., was wanted by U.S. officials for questioning in the 1985
slaying in Mexico of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
Enrique Camarena Salazar. He is also wanted on drug charges in the
United States.
   Honduran legislators criticized the incident and the Foreign
Ministry launched an investigation.
   The violent demonstration was unusual in Honduras, one of the
United States' closest allies in Central America.
   About 4,000 soldiers and police, many in tanks and trucks,
patrolled Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula on Saturday and Sunday.
   Presidential spokesman Lisandro Quesada said Monday that
President Jose Azcona Hoyo received repeated death threats in
anonymous telephone calls over the weekend.
   Monsignor Hector Enrique Santos, archbishop of Tegucigalpa, said
in an interview that the demonstrations showed ``barbaric
instincts'' and dealt a ``blow against the democratic continuity of
Honduras because they tend to undermine human coexistence.''
   Jaime Rosenthal Oliva, one of the nation's three vice
presidents, said the violence occurred because the government
violated the constitution in permitting Matta's extradition.
   ``I admire the U.S. fight to eliminate drug trafficking but I
consider that that nation has sufficient resources to accuse any
drug trafficker who lives here so that he can be judged in Honduras
after legal evidence is presented,'' he said.

<HEAD>Texas A&M Archaeologists Find Child's Skeleton at Submerged
Jamaican Ruins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas A&M University nautical
archaeologists excavating the submerged half of Jamaica's Port
Royal found remains of a child killed as he tried to flee during an
earthquake nearly 300 years ago, the university said Monday.
   The partial skeleton of the child, probably no older than 6, was
the first found in such a complete state during seven seasons of
digging in the sunken city, said project leader Don Hamilton.
   Port Royal, once home to English buccaneers and to a young naval
officer named Horatio Nelson, boasted a well-to-do population of
about 8,000 at the time of the quake.
   But on June 7, 1692, tremors over a period of roughly 30 minutes
dropped blocks of the city into the bay, killing 2,000 residents.
   Nearly 300 years later, Texas A&M researchers will resume their
archival work on items recovered so far, the university said. The
project will be featured May 2 in the PBS series, ``Underwater
Discoveries.''
   Among other finds from the latest round of excavations is what
appears to be part of the living quarters of well-to-do merchants.
Remains of a window complete with its slender lead frame have been
recovered where the front of a two-story house smashed to the
street during one of the tremors, Hamilton said.
   From what is probably the kitchen have come brass cooking pots,
sieves, pewter bowls, a woman's gold ring, candlesticks and
porcelain dishes. The almost-intact remains of a cricket were found
in an unbroken wine bottle excavated where mud had trapped the
insect.
   Port Royal, across the bay from modern-day Kingston, once was
rivaled only by Boston as a center of British commerce in the
Americas. Residents and visitors apparently liked tobacco because a
fourth of the nearly 5,000 artifacts recovered have been pipes or
parts of pipes.
   The port never regained its former importance because
earthquakes, fires and hurricanes blocked attempts to rebuild,
Hamilton said.

<HEAD>Democratic Contenders Voice Support For Notice Of Plant Closings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contenders urged
Congress to stand firm against administration pressure and retain
in its sweeping trade bill a provision requiring employers to give
notice of plant closings.
   ``I offer my strong encouragement to your efforts in resisting
any further weakening of these already quite modest provisions,''
Jesse Jackson said in a letter to Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   ``I urge you and other conferees to insist that mandatory
advance plant notification be included in the final version,'' said
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., in a letter to Bentsen. Both
messages were dated Friday and released Monday by the office of
Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich.
   The Reagan administration has been pushing Congress to drop the
plant closings provision.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis already had called for
retaining the provision, which would require companies with more
than 100 employees to give 60 days' notice before a plant closing
or large-scale layoff.
   ``I am aware that the administration has refused to accept any
form of advance notice provision and has threatened a veto of the
trade bill if the conference committee's provision passed,''
Dukakis said in a March 30 letter to Bentsen. ``I hope that the
threat is only that _ a threat that would not be carried out if the
situation actually presents itself.''
   ``Regardless of the president's intentions, I urge you to work
for retention of the plant closing provision in the trade bill,''
Dukakis said.
   The plant closings provision is one facet of a sweeping bill
that contains measures ranging from approval for the administration
to sign trade deals with other countries to repeal of the windfall
profits tax on oil companies.
   At the heart of the bill are provisions that restructure the way
in which the United States retaliates against violations of
international trade rules. Lawmakers say they are designed to open
foreign markets to U.S. exports.
   The measure has been approved in large part by a House-Senate
conference committee, although a few finishing touches remain to be
attended to.
   Any congressional move to drop provisions that might yield a
veto most likely would have to start with Bentsen under powers that
have been granted him by Senate conferees.
   Bentsen, as vice chairman of the conference committee, took the
lead in dropping a number of stringent provisions opposed earlier
by the Reagan administration.
   The administration has been describing the plant-closings
provision as one that would be disastrously expensive for industry.
While the measure contains no money provisions, some business
groups have suggested it would be a first step toward substantial
costs later.
   The candidates jumped into the debate amid new signals from the
administation that a veto could await the 1,000-page trade bill if
it arrives at the president's desk with the plant-closings
provision intact.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said in an interview on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show that he would meet with congressional
leaders early this week to discuss what lawmakers must do to win
presidential approval of the legislation.
   ``At the very least it will take removal of some provisions that
are now in that bill,'' Baker said. ``Such, for instance, as a
provision requiring that any business in the United States give
prior notice of layoffs or a desire to close a facility.''
   He stopped short, however, of saying that a veto would
automatically result from trade sanctions in the bill against
Japan's Toshiba electronics company because of a sale by a
subsidiary of submarine-silencing equipment to the Soviet Union.
   ``That is something that we don't like,'' Baker said. ``There
are a number of things in the bill that we do like. There are a
number of things in the bill that we need. I don't think you can
take each and every item in there and say this for sure will
trigger a veto. I think you can say that about the plant-closing
provision.''
   ``My own personal view is that the president will veto the bill
if that plant closing provision stays in there,'' he added.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said he hoped to bring the
final version of the trade bill to the House floor for a vote next
week.
   He said that before that happens there may be a few changes in
the measure and that he is not ``set in concrete'' on how the
provisions are drawn.

   The Department of Health and Human Services on
Monday published the clinical procedures that federal agencies must
follow in testing their employees for drug use.
   The final technical regulations published in the Federal
Register are essentially the same as HHS originally outlined more
than a year ago.
   Yet to gain final approval are guidelines drawn up by some 40
separate agencies _ thousands of pages in all _ on the more
controversial matter of how each agency will determine which
employees to test.
   Those plans are under review by HHS to make sure each of the
agencies has adopted the underlying clinical testing procedures in
their own plans.
   Once HHS completes that technical review _ expected within a
week or two _ all of the individual plans passing muster will be
forwarded to Congress for review.
   Aside from the possibility that members of Congress could object
to some of the agency plans, an HHS official noted that several
employee unions have indicated they are likely to challenge the
agency plans in court once they are issued.
   Kenneth Blaylock, president of the 700,000-member American
Federation of Government Employees, said the guidelines are an
overreaction ``to a situation that barely exists in the federal
sector.''
   ``The latest guidelines for conducting random drug tests on
government employees not only condemns the entire federal work
force as serious drug abusers, but assumes they are cheaters as
well,'' Blaylock said.
   Even though they do not address the fundamental controversy of
whether to test, the HHS standards themselves have been held up at
congressional insistence since February 1987 to allow time for
informal review and public comment.
   President Reagan ordered drug testing in September 1986 of
employees who have sensitive jobs and instructed HHS to develop the
scientific procedures to be followed.
   The Office of Personnel Management subsequently issued
regulations in November 1986 that could make as many as 1.1 million
civilian workers subject to testing, although only a fraction of
that number is likely to actually be tested.
   Designed to ensure that any person being tested is submitting
his or her own fresh urine, the HHS regulations published Monday
call for water in the toilet stalls where the samples are given to
contain a blue dye and for the sample's temperature to be taken
within four minutes.
   Both are to guard against the person submitting a sample diluted
with toilet water or one that was smuggled into the testing site. A
monitor would be nearby, but would not watch the person give the
sample.
   The guidelines also include elaborate instructions on
transportation of samples to make sure they are not mixed up and on
the laboratory testing procedures.

   Iraq said it fired three missiles into
Tehran and Isfahan on Monday, ending a three-day lull in the ``war
of the cities.''
   Iran reported later it fired two missiles at ``key military
targets'' in Baghdad, Iraq's capital, and shelled the battered port
city of Basra in southern Iraq, the naval base at Umm Qasr and
three border towns.
   Iran said the Iraqi missile attacks killed at least 20 civilians.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitord in
Cyprus, quoted Brig. Gen. Mohammed Hussein Jalali, the defense
minister, as saying Iran is now making most of its own missiles and
was capable of ``turning Baghdad into an inferno ... if the
criminal attacks on Iranian cities continue.''
   IRNA rported Jalali said Iran is producing two types of missiles
with ranges of 80 miles or more. The report did not elaborate.
   Iraq also has said it is making its own medium-range missiles.
Iran has used Soviet-made missiles and some Western analysts
believe the Iraqi missiles are modifications of Soviet weapons.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the missiles were fired at
Tehran and Isfahan in retaliation for Iranian shelling Sunday of
residential districts in Khanaqin and two Iraqi border cities.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   In ground action, IRNA said Iranian-backed Iraqi rebels killed
680 Iraqi soldiers and destroyed four bases in northeastern Iraq in
the last few days.
   It claimed 180 Iraqi troopers were killed near Zardeh in
Sulaimaniyeh province in ``infiltration operations'' and 500 were
slain in an ambush of a relief column.
   Iran's Revolutionary Guards launched an offensive in the
strategic region last monthi and Iran said the operations were to
avenge the deaths of 5,000 Kurds who it said were killed by Iraqi
chemical warfare attacks March 16-17.
   The Iranians claim they have captured 540 square miles of
territory in northeastern Iraq since March 16.
   Iraq said its warplanes and helicopter gunships flew 320 combat
missions against Iranian forces and other targets Monday.
   That's the highest number of missions reported flown in one day
for months and indicated heavy action along the 730-mile front.
   On Friday, the Iraqis fired several missiles at Tehran and other
cities before dawn as Iranians prepared to vote for a new 270-seat
Majlis, as the parliament is called.
   Dispatches from Baghdad said the Iraqis stopped shooting after
that to ``facilitate the vote-casting process, hoping that new,
responsible elements would be elected to parliament who might
seriously view the question of the war and put an end to it.''
   Reports from the Iranian agency said Iraq sought to disrupt the
vote and a ``massive turnout at the polls ... was a bitter defeat
for the tottering regime in Baghdad.''
   It confirmed one missile hit Tehran on Monday and another
exploded in Isfahan, which was the capital of Persia in the 17th
century. A mosque, hospital and homes were damaged in the two
cities, IRNA reported.
   Five civilians were killed and seven wounded Monday by an Iraqi
air raid near the northwestern city of Orumiyeh and several people
were killed by chemical bombs dropped late Sunday on Marivan, 140
miles south, the agency said.
   Iraqi warplanes tried to bomb Isfahan, in central Iran, on
Monday but were driven off by anti-aircraft fire, IRNA reported.
   The latest round of the war of the cities, in which thousands of
civilians have been killed, began Feb. 29 and more than 300
missiles have been fired by both sides.
   Baqer Karimian, head of Iran's election commission, was quoted
as saying the number of people voting in the Majlis election was 40
percent higher than in 1984 ``despite Iraqi air and missile
attacks.''
   According to IRNA, more than 14 million votes had been counted
Moday but final results were not expected for several days. It said
officials had declared winners in 160 of the 270 districts, but did
not indicate who had won.
   Western political analysts do not expect any change in the
Majlis to hasten an end to the war. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
the 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch, has vowed to continue
fighting until President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is ousted.

   A 21-year-old woman was arrested after her
see-through, fish-net attire was blamed for causing several
near-accidents as she walked down the street.
   Peoria police said Dolly May Jane McCloud of East Peoria was
arrested Saturday on charges of public indecency and disorderly
conduct, as well as obstructing police.
   According to police reports, an unidentified driver reported
several motorists nearly collided when they suddenly slowed to look
at Ms. McCloud.
   Sgt. Phillip Benne said Ms. McCloud was wearing a see-through,
fish-net body suit that exposed her chest. She was covered by other
clothes from the waist down, Benne said.
   Benne said he saw three motorists slam on their brakes, honk
their horns and wave at Ms. McCloud, who was taken to the Peoria
County Jail and released after posting $100 cash bond. She is
scheduled to appear in court on May 2.

   Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson's campaign organization said Monday it already has
submitted 1986 financial records the Internal Revenue Service is
going to court to obtain.
   ``If there is a hearing, we will attend to show that we have
complied with the order,'' said Barbara Gattullo, a representative
for Americans for Robertson. She said the material was turned over
last week.
   James F. Patterson, treasurer of the organization, said it has
been ordered to court before U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke
to show why the IRS should not be given records needed to verify
the accuracy of the group's 1986 tax filing. The hearing was
originally set for Tuesday but was continued until April 28.
   Court documents show that the IRS first requested the financial
information in December 1987. The IRS also asked for copies of
fund-raising letters sent out and ``records of any transactions
with The Freedom Council or Christian Broadcasting Network.''
   Robertson, a former television evangelist, founded the
non-profit CBN and was its president until last October when he
announced his candidacy. He turned over the operation of the cable
network to his son Tim Robertson.
   The Freedom Council was established in 1981 with seed money from
CBN. According to former council officials, nearly $3 million was
pumped into the organization from CBN in 1985, the year Robertsn
began establishing his grass-roots campaign organization.
   Many credit the Freedom Council, also a tax-exempt, charitable
organization, with mobilizing Robertson's cadre of volunteers,
mostly political first-timers drawn mainly from charismatic or
fundamentalist churches. Robertson used these volunteers to pack
local GOP meetings and caucuses to gain control of the party at the
local level in several states.
   Under federal tax laws, tax-exempt entities cannot raise money
for, or support, political candidates.
   The stated purpose of the council, which closed its operation in
October 1986, was to educate Christians on how to get involved in
politics. However, critics have charged that the group was a front
for Robertson's then-unofficial political campaign.
   The IRS currently is probing the tax-exempt status of CBN over
the same general issue.
   If the money was used for Robertson's campaign, then the
tax-exempt status of CBN would be in jeopardy. If, as CBN and
Freedom Council officials have said, the money was used to educate
Christians as to how to become involved in the political process,
then it would be legitimate donation.
   Americans For Robertson, the campaign organization, filed for
organization with the Federal Election Commission in July 1986.
   During 1986, Bob Slosser, president of CBN University, served as
president of the Freedom Council after retired Gen. Jerry Curry
resigned from the post in the spring. When Americans for Robertson,
the campaign organization, was organized in July 1986, Marc Nuttle
was named acting director. At the same time, he was also a paid
consultant for the Freedom Council.
   Nuttle became Robertson's campaign manager until last month when
he was assigned other duties as part of Robertson's scaling back of
his campaign. Though he remains the lone official challenger of
Vice President George Bush, Robertson admits he has no chance for
the nomination.
   He has laid off most of his national staff and restricted his
campaigning to occasional appearances in states that select
delegates to the national convention by caucus.

   Israel expelled eight Palestinians from the
occupied lands Monday, accusing them of inciting the four months of
violence there, and it issued deportation orders against 12 others.
   In the West Bank, meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and killed two
Arabs after a group of Palestinians threw stones and bottles at a
patrol, the army said. Hospital officials said eight Arabs were
wounded.
   Among the 12 receiving deportation orders were six Palestinians
from a West Bank village where an Israeli settler girl and two
Arabs were killed in a clash last week.
   Palestinian leaders contended the purpose of the expulsions was
to appease right-wing politicians and Jewish settlers angered by an
army report that said Tirza Porat, 15, was killed by a bullet from
another settler's gun.
   But Israel television quoted a top military official as saying
the deportations were intended as a warning to Palestinians.
   In the West Bank village of Rai near Nablus, troops shot and
killed two Arabs after a patrol was pelted with rocks and bottles,
the army said.
   Arab doctors said three other Palestinians, including an
11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy, were wounded in Rai.
Hospital officials said four others were wounded in Nablus and one
in Jenin, another village near Nablus.
   The deaths brought to 143 the number of Arabs killed since riots
began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Two Israelis,
Ms. Porat and a soldier, have also died.
   The army said Monday that 4,800 Palestinians have been arrested
since the riots began. Five hundred of them have been convicted,
3,400 are awaiting trial and 900 are being held in administrative
detention, which allows imprisonment without trial for six months.
   Arab residents of the occupied territories followed Palestine
Liberation Organization orders to close stores and stay home from
jobs in Israel on Monday. Underground leaflets called for a ``day
of firebombs'' April 21.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said:
``We strongly oppose deportations from the occupied territories,''
which he described as ``counterproductive. ... They only further
inflame passions.''
   Redman said the practice violates international human rights
agreements to which Israel is a signatory. The Geneva Convention
bars expulsion of civilians in time of war, but Israeli officials
say the convention applies only to mass expulsions.
   Army helicopters flew the eight deportees to Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone in southern Lebanon. The army offered
them a medical examination and gave each $50 before soldiers led
them to two taxis heading for Syrian-controlled territory.
   Israel television showed some of the men carrying their
belongings in plastic bags. When the taxis sped off, one of the
Palestinians flashed a victory sign.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said on Israel radio: ``We are not
expelling residents. We are only expelling agitators, preachers (of
violence) and extremists. The past has proven that expulsions are
one of the most effective deterrents.''
   Palestinian leaders said the expulsions would feed bitterness.
``The more the government uses drastic measures, the more people
become determined, even though they don't have the power to
overthrow the authorities,'' said Rashad al Shawwa, a former Gaza
City mayor deposed by Israel.
   Monday's deportation was the second in four months of riots. The
expulsion of four Palestinians on Jan. 13 provoked an international
outcry. More than 1,000 Arabs have been expelled from the
territories since 1967.
   Expulsion orders against five of those expelled Monday were
issued three months ago. The most prominent deportee is Abed al
Aziz Uda Rafia, 33, of Gaza City, described by the army as chief
ideologue of a Moslem fundamentalist group pledged to destroy
Israel and create a Palestinian homeland through war.
   Elias Freij, a Christian Palestinian who is mayor of Bethlehem,
called the deportations ``a revenge for Beita,'' the village where
Arabs attacked 16 teen-age hikers and two armed guards from Elo
Moreh, a Jewish settlement.
   ``It was done to appease the settlers,'' Freij said.
   Uri Ariel, head of the West Bank settlements council, said
Monday's action was ``too little too late'' and demanded more
expulsions.
   The Beita clash Wednesday has provoked debate along party lines
since army investigators said Miss Porat apparently was struck by a
bullet from the gun of Romem Al Dubi, one of the two guards
accompanying the teen-agers.
   Settlers and right-wing legislators said the army report was
one-sided. Geulah Cohen of the right-wing party Tehiya said Lt.
Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, ``jumped to conclusions
and, acting as a judge, pointed an accusing finger at the
settlers.''
   Peres, who leads the center-left Labor Party, said to the
critics: ``This is very serious, the attempt to involve the army in
political matters.''

   U.S. oil giant Texaco Inc. said
Monday it is negotiating to sell its West German subsidiary
Deutsche Texaco AG as part of a restructuring.
   Texaco officials confirmed news reports and industry rumors that
its Hamburg-based unit is up for sale. But the officials refused to
name prospective buyers or give details of the negotiations.
   ``We can't disclose any details, especially the names of the
companies interested in the takeover, while negotiations with
interested parties are going on,'' Texaco said in a statement.
   Texaco officials Friday told Deutsche Texaco's supervisory board
the parent company planned to sell its 99.1 percent share of the
German subsidiary as part of a restructuring to lead it out of
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   Industry analysts said the German company would be an attractive
acquisition because of its large gasoline marketing network,
substantial cash reserves and oil and gas assets.
   Deutsche Texaco has 1,903 gasoline stations in West Germany.
   Company officials declined to say whether the company is
profitable but said the company will release its 1987 figure next
month.
   Texaco said in its 1987 annual report it hopes to raise at least
$3 billion through the sale of assets. The sale of Deutsche Texaco
could net about $1.7 billion, officials said.

<HEAD>Officials Hail Limited Test Ban Treaty to Mark 25th Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet and American officials marked the 25th
anniversary of the Limited Test Ban Treaty Monday by hailing it as
a historic pact that laid the groundwork for subsequent nuclear
arms agreements.
   Officials gathered at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum to
reminisce about the events surrounding its signing.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin praised President Kennedy, who
oversaw the U.S. side of negotiations, saying the treaty ``would
not have been attained without a fresh and sober look'' at
superpower rivalry by ``that dynamic leader.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, brother of the late president, called
the treaty a ``watershed event in Soviet-American relations ... the
first major arms control agreement involving the superpowers.''
   The treaty, signed July 25, 1963, after 10 days of negotiations
in Moscow involving Soviet, U.S., and British representatives,
banned testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, in outer space
and under water.
   Other testing bans have been signed since, but the Test Ban
Treaty remains the only one ratified by both superpowers.
   Former Soviet and U.S. participants in the negotiations agreed
at a news conference that the treaty gave rise to a series of other
nuclear arms pacts between the superpowers, including last year's
accord to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   McGeorge Bundy, special assistant for national security affairs
from 1961 to 1966, told reporters the signing ``brought a prospect
of further and larger agreements,'' and praised Kennedy for
ignoring U.S. perceptions that the Soviets were further advanced in
testing.
   Alexei Roshchkin, a disarmament expert in the Soviet foreign
ministry at the time of the signing, concurred.
   ``This was a first step in post-war history ... a first step in
the field of disarmamanent,'' he said.
   Theodore Sorensen, special counsel to the president from 1961 to
1963 and part of a small group of advisers that guided the talks
from Washington by telephone, said ``there was a great sense of joy
and relief when word was received'' at the White House that the
treaty had been signed.
   ``But backslapping was not the Kennedy way,'' Sorensen said.
``On the contrary, he immediately began to worry about Senate
ratification,'' which came in the fall. Intense lobbying by the
president left only 11 Democrats and eight Republicans opposed.
   Soviet officials recalled the jubilation of their leader, Nikita
Khrushchev, as described by former Kennedy aide Arthur M.
Schlesinger Jr. in his book, ``A Thousand Days.''
   As Khrushchev and U.S. Undersecretary of State Averell Harriman
strode through a Kremlin park, ``a huge crowd collected behind
them,'' Schlesinger wrote.
   According to the book, Khrushchev turned and asked the crowd:
```We've just signed a test-ban treaty. I'm going to take him to
dinner. Do you think he's earned his dinner?' The people applauded
and applauded.''
   The signing and subsequent ratification followed 336 nuclear
explosions in the atmosphere by the United States, Britain and the
Soviet Union over 13 years.
   The agreement also was important as a tangible sign of emerging
detente after the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 brought the
world to the brink of nuclear war.
   France and China, the only other nations that openly engaged in
nuclear weapons test programs, have not agreed to the test ban. But
all French nuclear explosions have been underground since 1974, and
China exploded its last atmospheric device in 1980.
   Disagreement on verification measures has held up joint
ratification of the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty limiting test explosions to 150
kilotons. A kiloton equals the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators began a second round of talks on
ratifying those two treaties in February, and participants Monday
invoked the Limited Test Ban treaty as an example that agreement is
possible.

   A senior Iraqi envoy said Monday there is
no point in continuing talks on ending the Persian Gulf war until
Iran accepts a Security Council peace plan.
   ``We do not want to enter into another round of futile
discussions and arguments and wrangling,'' Wisam Alzahawi, a senior
deputy foreign minister, told reporters after a meeting with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Nearly nine months have passed since the Security Council passed
a resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire and troop withdrawal
as the first steps toward a negotiated end to the 7{-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraq endorsed the resolution almost immediately; Iran has yet to
do so.
   The United States wants the council to impose an arms embargo on
Iran for not accepting the resolution but has failed to muster the
support of the Soviet Union.
   Alzahawi said he told Perez de Cuellar that Iraq is ready ``to
sit and negotiate with the Iranians under the auspices of the
secretary-general once the Security Council obtains Iran's
unequivocal, clear-cut official acceptance of the resolution.''
   Iraq says it accepts a cease-fire and troop withdrawal as the
first steps in a settlement of the war. Iran wants the United
Nations to condemn Iraq as the aggressor in the war before it pulls
out any troops.
   Alzawahi said Iraq is ``not entering into any details of
implementation at this stage before we have a clear-cut acceptance
from Iran.''
   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Larijani, held talks
with Perez de Cuellar last week. Larijani dismissed Iran's position
on the resolution as irrelevant and instead urged the Security
Council to condemn Iraq for using chemical weapons.
   Iran's U.N. representative, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, repeated
this request at a news conference Monday, saying the council should
ban the export to Iraq of chemicals used to make the deadly weapons.
   Alzahawi dodged questions from reporters about Iraq's use of
chemical warfare and accused Iran of using the weapons. He said
Iraq would ``observe the rules of international combat'' if Iran
did.
   Alzahawi also denied that he and Perez de Cuellar has discussed
the issue of chemical weapons on Monday. The U.N. chief has sent
teams to Tehran and Baghdad to investigate charges that such
weapons were being used.
   Iran has charged that Iraq dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs
on three Kurdish towns in Iraq in March, killing 5,000 Kurds.

   Arab hijackers killed a second hostage on
Monday, tossed his bloody body from a commandeered Kuwaiti jet and
threatened to kill nearly 50 other captives if the plane wasn't
refueled.
   The gunmen said the dead man was a ``Kuwaiti officer.'' He was
the second Kuwaiti military man slain by the hijackers during the
weeklong ordeal aboard the Kuwait Airways jet.
   The hijackers have demanded that Kuwait release 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists convicted in 1984 for bombings at the U.S. and French
embassies.
   Sources close to the negotiations said, however, that the
hijackers demanded freedom Monday only for the three men among the
17 who have been sentenced to death. Kuwait has rejected all of the
gunmen's demands.
   In Kuwait, Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah said
his country is prepared to lose more hostages rather than give in
to terrorism.
   ``We will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard the
plane, but we will not surrender to any blackmail, even if we lose
more of them,'' he told a news conference. ``This is not the
decision of Kuwait's government. It is a decision of the people.''
   There are 52 people aboard the Boeing 747, including three
members of Kuwait's extensive royal family and the hijackers, who
are wearing blue hoods and armed with grenades and handguns.
   Sabah said there are at least eight hijackers, all of them
Arabs, carrying forged passports from Bahrain, Iraq and Colombia.
   He was asked if the jet would be attacked and said, ``The
decision to storm is not ours. It lies with the Cypriot government,
on whose land the plane stands.''
   The man killed Monday was pushed from the blue-and-white plane
at 3:07 p.m. (8:07 a.m. EDT) after Cypriot officials ignored two
deadlines to refuel the jet.
   Doctors at Larnaca morgue said he had suffered injuries to the
side of his face, apparently from a beating. They said he had been
shot twice in the head at close range before his body, hands bound
behind his back, was thrown onto the tarmac at Larnaca Airport.
   ``We have executed a Kuwaiti officer,'' a hijacker told the
control tower. ``We also reconfirm that the craft must be refueled
immediately, immediately, before we take more dangerous steps.''
   At dusk, the hijackers put one of the passengers, identified as
Fadl Marzouk el-Oteibi, on the radio.
   Speaking in Arabic, he told the control tower: ``The hijackers
say that if you don't give us fuel they will kill all the
passengers. Please listen to this and greetings to my family.''
   The hijackers said they wanted about nine hours' worth of fuel
so they could fly to an unspecified ``neutral country.''
   On Saturday, the hijackers killed their first victim, a
24-year-old Kuwaiti border guard.
   They set the first deadline for refueling Monday at 1 p.m. (6
a.m. EDT) and warned that ``we will kill a personality related to
the unjust Kuwaiti regime.''
   The members of the royal family on the plane are businesman
Fadel Khaled al-Sabah and his sisters Ebtesam and Anware.
   The first deadline passed without incident after Malaz Abdo,
deputy director of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office
in Nicosia, and a Cypriot official negotiated with the hijackers.
   The hijackers then set a 2:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. EDT) deadline and
told the tower that refueling must start or ``you'll receive the
corpse.'' Forty-seven minutes later, the body was thrown out.
   On Sunday, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction in Lebanon
threatened to kill American and French hostages it holds if any
attempt is made to storm the plane.
   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, made the threat in a
statement delivered to the Reuters news agency in Beirut along with
photographs of American Terry Anderson and Frenchman Jean-Paul
Kauffmann, both journalists kidnapped in 1985.
   Anderson, 40, is the chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press. Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 55.
   Kidnappers of another American, Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, theatened on Monday to hang him.
   A communique issued in Beirut by the pro-Iranian Organization of
the Oppressed on Earth said: ``We shall put the American agent Col.
William Higgins on the gallows if anyone attempts to attack the
plane.'' No photo accompanied the communique.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., served with a U.N. observer group
in southern Lebanon and was kidnapped on Feb. 17.
   Kuwait Airways Flight 422 was hijacked April 5 with 112 people
aboard as it flew from from Bangkok to Kuwait. It was forced down
in Mashhad, Iran, where 57 people were freed.
   The plane left Iran on Friday after refueling. Lebanon and Syria
refused to let it touch down at their airports and it landed at
Larnaca after the pilot radioed that he was running out of fuel.
   Another captive, an ailing 32-year-old Kuwaiti, was freed in
Larnaca Saturday.
   The hijackers' reference to a ``neutral country'' Monday was the
first time since landing at Larnaca that they have given any
inkling of where they want to fly if they get fuel. They did not
name a country.
   But Kuwait's Al-Qabas daily reported that Algerian officials
have become involved in the negotiations.
   On Sunday, the hijackers threatened to take off and force the
pilot to crash the jet into the emir's palace in Kuwait City.
   In Washington, the Reagan administration expressed support for
the Cypriot refusal to refuel the plane.

   Security forces detained five Liberian
journalists Monday in a continuing crackdown on the news media in
this West African nation.
   Office workers at the Footprints Today newspaper said editor
Momolu Sirleaf and three other members of the editorial board were
taken into custody by armed soldiers.
   A fifth journalist, free-lance reporter Issac Bantu, was seized
while he was in the office of the defense minister, Gen. Grey D.
Allison, according to other reporters. Bantu did free-lance work
for The Associated Press and British Broadcasting Corp.
   The journalists were detained shortly after the independent
Press Union of Liberia declared that the government closure of the
Sun Times newspaper last week was illegal and vowed to challenge
the action in court.
   Mary Cummings-Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Defense Ministry,
said the four Footprints Today journalists were taken into custody
for questioning and Allison wanted to talk to them.
   Minutes after Bantu entered Allison's office, security agents
dragged him out and took him to the office of the provost marshal
general who is the senior operational officer for military
security, other journalists said.
   Officials at the provost marshal's office refused to answer
questions about Bantu.
   Less than an hour before he was seized, Bantu filed a report to
AP in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, about the press union's decision to
challenge the closing of the Sun Times and the arrest last week of
one of its reporters, Thomas Nimley.
   The government acted against the Sun Times because of articles
on the arrest of a Ghanaian for possession of explosives and the
firing of the commander of a government anti-terrorist squad.
   On Sunday, Liberia's independent newspapers announced they
planned to shut down for a week to protest government actions
against the news media.
   Those actions included the eliminination of British Broadcasting
Corp. and Voice of America news broadcasts on the official radio
station.
   Information Minister Emmanuel Bowier also ordered government-run
corporations to stop advertising in the independent news media and
water and electricity has been cut at various newspaper offices.

   The pilot of a home-built biplane was in
stable condition Monday, recovering from injuries he suffered when
his aircraft made a crash-landing before an estimated 45,000 people
at an aerobatic show.
   The Sun 'N Fun Fly-in accident left Ron Cox, 32, of Mountain
Grove, Mo., with chipped vertebrae, bruises and abrasions. He was
hospitalized at Lakeland Regional Medical Center.
   Cox and another pilot were performing stunts in tandem Sunday
when the $40,000 biplane Cox spent 13 months building caught fire
at about 1,000 feet. The California man said he blacked out on
landing.
   ``It was just a hard landing,'' Cox said, adding he wasn't sure
what caught fire on the plane.
   Rescue workers removed Cox from the cockpit after the crash,
Polk County Sheriff's Capt. Tommy Holcom said.

   C.G. Taylor, a self-taught aircraft
designer whose Taylor Cub evolved into the overwhelmingly
successful Piper Cub of the 1930s and 1940s, has died in Houston,
his daughter said Monday.
   Taylor, 89, had suffered from Parkinson's disease for more than
a year, and died March 29, said Carol Taylor Sharp.
   In partnership with William Piper, Taylor designed and sold the
Taylor Cub, a lightweight two-passenger airplane at Bradford, Pa.
in the early 1930s.
   After several years in production, Piper bought Taylor's
interest in the aircraft and began manufacturing it under the Piper
Cub label.
   The Piper Aircraft Co. went on to build more than 20,000 of the
simple, yellow airplanes _ initially for about $700 apiece.
   Taylor designed another single-engine aircraft in 1936, the
Taylorcraft, which was also highly successful.
   Born in Rochester, N.Y., Taylor is survived by five children.

   The attorney for an American convicted
of drug trafficking filed an appeal Monday of his six-year sentence.
   A three-judge provincial court found Conan Owen, 23, of
Annandale, Va., guilty of drug trafficking on April 5 and sentenced
him to six years in prison.
   Owen's lawyer, Ana Campa, said she had filed an appeal. She said
the prosecution had meanwhile appealed the court's decision to
aquit her client on a separate charge of possession of contraband.
   That charge would carry an additional three years in prison.
   Ms. Campa said it was normal in Spanish drug cases for the
prosecution to appeal if the court failed to convict on the
contraband charge.
   Owen is a 1986 Syracuse University graduate, a 1984 summer
intern in Vice President George Bush's office and a second
lieutenant in the U.S. Army reserve.
   He went on trial in Barcelona on March 26 after serving more
than a year of pretrial detention in the city's 85-year-old prison.
   Owen was arrested March 13, 1987 at Barcelona's airport after a
customs agent found about four pounds of cocaine in a suitcase he
had checked through on his flight from Santiago, Chile, via
Amsterdam to Barcelona.
   Owen told the court he believed he was taking a suitcase full of
tourist brochures to Barcelona for a travel agency that hired him
for a four-day free-lance photo assignment. He had been given the
suitcase by George Barahona of Alexandria, Va., he said.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III personally delivered copies to
Spanish judicial authorities of a statement by Barahona saying Owen
knew nothing about the drugs and had been used as a courier.
   Under a 1987 Spanish-American treaty. U.S. citizens convicted of
crimes in Spain can serve their prison terms in the United States.
   But a transfer cannot be approved until all appeals have been
exhausted.
   he court said it was convinced Owen knew there was cocaine in
the suitcase. But it said the cocaine had not passed out of the
airport customs area and so it rejected the contraband charge.

   Woody Kling, a two-time Emmy winner who spent
40 years writing TV comedy for shows ranging from Milton Berle's
``Texaco Star Theater'' to the ``Cabbage Patch Kids,'' has died of
lung cancer at 62.
   Kling, who died early Sunday at UCLA Medical Center, began his
career in the 1940s with Buddy Arnold, writing sketches and jokes
for Berle's comedy show, the ``Texaco Star Theater.'' Kling also
co-wrote the opening jingle, ``Oh, we're the men of Texaco, we work
from Maine to Mexico.''
   Berle, ``Mr. Television,'' called Kling's work on the show a big
help to his own career.
   ``He was really a darling man,'' said Berle. ``He was always
charming and kind. He was very sharp. I thought he was a brilliant
man.''
   Kling, who lived in Los Angeles, also co-wrote and helped
produce the Jackie Gleason and Carol Burnett variety shows, and
wrote for Will Rogers, Jack Paar and Red Buttons.
   He was nominated for five Emmys, winning in 1972 and 1973 for
scripts for ``The Carol Burnett Show.''
   Kling was a co-executive producer on Norman Lear's television
series ``All in the Family.''
   He created and produced the cartoons ``Casper, the Friendly
Ghost'' and ``Beatles'' as well as the ``Cabbage Patch Kids
Christmas Special.''
   In addition to his wife of 21 years, Mary, he is survived by a
son, Anthony.

   Indian and Sri Lankan troops killed 12
Tamil rebels in two gun battles and in a separate incident four
Tamils committed suicide by swallowing cyanide to avoid capture,
officials reported Monday.
   Eight rebels were killed Sunday when Sri Lankan soldiers raided
a jungle hideout in the Anuradhapura district about 100 miles
northeast of Colombo.
   A Sri Lankan military official said the hideout was used by
guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam who were blamed
for the massacre last week of 14 Sinhalese villagers. He said the
camp was 10 miles northeast of Merigaswela where the villagers'
mutilated bodies were found Friday.
   The troops captured three Soviet-designed automatic rifles, a
submachine gun and a shotgun, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. He did not report any army casualties.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting for four years for a separate
nation. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's population of 16 million people and they claim they are
discriminated against by the Buddhist Sinhalese, who are the
majority.
   An Indian diplomat in Colombo said that on Saturday, four Tamil
Tigers killed themselves by biting cyanide capsules as they were
about to be captured by Indian troops in Batticaloa, 140 miles east
of Colombo.
   Many Tamil guerrillas carry cyanide capusules, and according to
official and unofficial reports at least 200 have committed suicide
since Tamil militants began their separatist war.
   The Indian diplomat, who spoke with the condition he not be
identified, also said Indian troops killed four Tamil rebels in a
gunfight Saturday at Vavuniya, 135 miles northeast of Colombo. He
said one Indian soldier was wounded.
   More than 50,000 Indian soldiers are in Sri Lanka to disarm the
Tamil rebels under an agreement signed July 29 by the Indian and
Sri Lankan governments.
   India is predominantly Hindu and has tried to arrange a peace
settlement in Sri Lanka. The Tamil Tigers, the largest rebel group,
have rejected demands that they lay down their arms and are
battling both Sri Lankan and Indian forces.

<HEAD>Dukakis Blames Arab Leaders For West Bank Violence</HEAD>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said Monday that Arab
leaders, by refusing to negotiate with Israel, are ``responsible
for the turmoil and the violence'' in the West Bank.
   Addressing Jewish leaders, Dukakis said the government of
Israel, as well as the ``generation of young Palestinians'' in the
region, do not bear the responsbility for recent violence there.
   ``Just as Camp David stands as an example of what can be
accomplished when leaders choose peace, the recent events in the
West Bank and Gaza show what happens when Arab leaders are
unwilling to walk in the footsteps of President Sadat,'' the late
Egyptian leader, Dukakis said.
   Dukakis made the comments in an address to the Conference of
Presidents of major American Jewish Organizations, an umbrella
group of leaders of 44 of the largest national Jewish organizations.
   With the race for the Democratic presidential nomination
focusing on New York's primary April 19, rival Albert Gore Jr.
spoke to the group earlier and strongly sided with Israel on the
violence in the occupied territories.
   The third Democratic candidate, Jesse Jackson, has declined an
invitation to address the group citing scheduling problems,
organization spokesman Richard Cohen said.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, spent much of the day at
the State House in Boston before flying to New York.
   He later visited a New York restaurant, and planned to attend a
private reception and stop at a rally on Staten Island. He also was
attending an Academy Awards reception.
   Dukakis' cousin Olympia, made a pitch for him as she accepted
her Academy Award for best supporting actress on Monday night in
Los Angeles. ``OK, Michael, let's go!'' she said, waving her Oscar
statuette. Ms. Dukakis won for her role in the comedy
``Moonstruck.''
   Earlier, addressing the Jewish leaders, Dukakis said ``it is
critically important that the world understand who is responsible
for the turmoil and the violence'' of recent weeks between
Palestinians and Israelis.
   ``It is not the generation of young Palestinians who have grown
up in uncertainty, and who have been taught by their elders to
hate,' he said.
   ``It is not a government in Jerusalem that struggles to maintain
order while seeking an opportunity to negotiate with responsible
Arab leaders about the future of the territories,'' Dukakis said.
   ``It is, regretably, Arab leaders themselves who have time and
again rejected the chance to sit down with Israel and negotiate a
permanent peace in the Middle East,'' he said.
   Dukakis cited ``principles'' for policy in the Middle East _
that real progress toward peace will not be made until Arab leaders
``are willing to negotiate directly,'' and until they accept
Israel's right to exist ``within borders that are secure and
defensible.''
   Dukakis cited his own remarks of 11 years ago, saying, ``Israel
needs room to breathe, and a return to the 1967 borders is out of
the question.''
   He later told reporters ``there will have to be some exchange of
land for peace'' but short of a return to Israel's prior borders.
   He said the Palestine Liberation Organization cannot be a Middle
East negotiator ``until it renounces terrorism in word and deed,''
until it accepts UN resolutions 242 and 338, and until it renounces
its own statement that peace ``can only come at the price of
Israel's right to exist.''
   Dukakis said ``I welcome'' Secretary of State George Shultz's
peace initiative while not agreeing ``with evey aspect.''
   Taking questions from the Jewish leaders, Dukakis was asked if
he supports establishment of a Palestinian state. He said that
should be a matter of negotiations between Israel and neighboring
countries.
   He was also asked about the future of Jerusalem and said it too
``has too be subject to negotiation.'' He later told reporters,
``I'm for a united Jerusalem'' under Israeli control.
   Dukakis was asked why he hasn't drawn more distinctions with
Jackson, with one questioner describing Jackson as ``an
anti-Semite.''
   Dukakis said, ``We have differences in the Middle East.'' He
later told reporters, ``I'm not going to characterize any of the
people in this race.''
   He said the next president ``should insist'' that the Soviets
``let Jews and other minorities leave if they wish and let them
worship freely.''

   A federal agent testified Monday in
the cocaine-smuggling trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas that the
investigation began in 1977 when he started following large
expenditures of cash by a member of a Jacksonville gang.
   Soon into the investigation, Ed Ward was identified as the head
of the smuggling organizaton, Drug Enforcement Administration agent
Doug Driver testified.
   Ward, now a convicted drug smuggler, was the key prosecution
witness against Lehder and testified he was the pilot for most of
the cocaine flights listed in the indictment against Lehder.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are on trial
on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into
the United States from Colombia via the Bahamian island of Norman's
Cay from 1978 to 1980.
   Testimony began Nov. 16.
   In November 1978, Driver, Starratt and a DEA pilot flew to
Norman's Cay to investigate Ward's assets on the island.
   ``We were more or less posing as smugglers ourselves,'' Driver
said, adding that he and the other agent took photographs at Ward's
house and dock, but noticed they were being watched.
   When their plane began to take off, they saw a van on the runway
carrying a man with an automatic weapon, Driver testified.
   Under cross-examination, Driver could not recall what weapons
Bahamian police carried when he visited the island last year.
   ``There is a difference in seeing a weapon in the hands of a
police officer and seeing a weapon in the hands of a thug,'' Driver
told defense attorney Ed Shohat.
   Shohat objected to much of Driver's testimony, claiming it was
hearsay. Driver has been allowed to sit through the testimony of
all witnesses in the trial.
   When members of Ward's smuggling group were indicted in 1981,
Lehder was listed as one of the co-defendants.
   Driver testified that federal officials spent four days in
Bogota meeting with the attorney general of Colombia in 1983 to
seek Lehder's extration to the United States. On the trip were U.S.
Attorney Robert Merkle, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller and
another DEA agent, Bobby Starratt.
   As a result of that visit, an extradition order was signed in
May 1984. Lehder was not arrested until Feb. 4, 1987.
   Driver also testified about the arrest in Haiti of Ward's
smuggling group, and said that on their flight back to Jacksonville
about a DC-3 the group began singing ``Homeward Bound'' and
commercial jingles.
   The jury also was shown a videotape taken last April on a visit
to Norman's Cay by Merkle, Mueller and Driver that showed the
island had become nearly deserted.
   Introduced into evidence Monday were address and telephone books
confiscated in a raid on Reed's house in February 1987.
   The books contained phone numbers for Lehder in Colombia, plus
the names of others identified in the trial.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise. A separate Miami indictment accuses
him of being one of the leaders of the Medellin cartel, which
officials say is responsible for about 80 percent of the cocaine
shipments into the United States.
   Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged with only being a member
of the smuggling conspiracy.

   Hollywood's reigning royalty turned out
Monday evening in basic black and white with a few dashes of color
as elegance replaced glitz for the 60th annual Academy Awards _
except for Cher.
   The star of ``Moonstruck,'' who arrived fashionably late,
knocked the scream meter off the scale when she stepped from her
limousine outside the Shrine Auditorium in an almost-not-there
diaphanous gown, only partly covered by a dark black cape.
   But Cher was one of the exceptions to the rule.
   Actress Liza Minnelli typified this year's style with a bright
red cape draped over a long crepe black dress, while Marlee Matlin
exemplified the few bright exceptions, wearing a strapless,
knee-length purple dress with a large bow hanging from her side.
   Perennial Edie Williams wore a bikini top over a pale blue mini
skirt and sported a puppy on one shoulder, but the rest of the
turnout at the cavernous Shrine Auditorium exercised good taste and
classic styling.
   Fifteen minutes before showtime, actresses Meryl Streep and
Glenn Close, nine months pregnant and aided by a cane, were seen
marching quickly up Jefferson Boulevard to the theater in an effort
to make it to the Academy Awards on time.
   Protesters on Jefferson Boulevard included Bible-thumping
Christians carrying signs reading ``Movie Idolaters Repent,''
``Fear God'' and ``Repent or Perish.''
   Guardian Angel leader Curtis Sliwa and his self-declared band of
red-bereted crimebusters chanted alongside the Christians and
marched around mock caskets in protest of Friday's release of the
realistic police gang movie ``Colors.''
   Los Angeles police are in the midst of a declared war against
gangs, and Sliwa said the motion picture will incite more violence.
``It shouldn't be released now at the height of the storm,'' he
said.
   Many Oscar guests in limousines and passenger cars gave Sliwa
and his troops thumbs up signs of approval as they passed.
   Fans in the bleachers were whipped up by Oscar greeter and
columnist Army Archerd who conducted an impromptu fan poll. The
best picture winner on the applause meter was ``Moonstruck.''
   In the middle of the bleachers were seven Glenn Close
lookalikes, with frizzy blonde hair and wearing ``Fatal
Attraction'' T-shirts.

<HEAD>Democrats Wrestle With Middle East Policy in New York Campaigning</HEAD>

   Michael Dukakis said Monday that Arab leaders are ``responsible
for the turmoil and the violence'' in Israel's occupied territories
as Democratic presidential candidates wrestled with Middle East
policy, looking for the right moves for victory in New York.
   Jesse Jackson, often attacked for what critics call pro-Arab
stands, continued to distance himself from the Palestine Liberation
Organization by saying that allowing extremists at the bargaining
table would be a ``formula for catastrophe.''
   Albert Gore Jr., who earlier exchanged sharp words with fellow
Democrats on the Middle East, took a conciliatory line. He also
admitted he has to do well in the April 19 New York primary to
continue in the race.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, got a boost from his cousin, Olympia
Dukakis, who won an Academy Award Monday night as best supporting
actress for her role in the comedy ``Moonstruck.''
   ``OK, Michael, let's go!'' she called as she accepted the award
at the nationally televised ceremony in Los Angeles.
   Dukakis was making an appearance at an Italian restaurant in
Greenwich Village that figured in the film, and planned to call his
cousin from there with congratulations.
   The Massachusetts governor had said beforehand that he thought
Ms. Dukakis was ``just marvelous'' in the role. And her victory, he
said, ``may be a sign of good things to come in New York in a
week.''
   Republican nominee-apparent George Bush got back on the trail
Monday, visiting an IBM research facility in New York and
proclaiming his strong support for Israel as a reason for Jews to
back his candidacy.
   ``I think everyone shold vote for me. Besides that, I'm a good
friend of Israel,'' Bush said.
   The vice president brushed off concerns that the
all-but-concluded GOP contest could drop him out of the voters'
eyes as the Democrats continue to fight. ``We don't have all the
excitement that exists on the Democratic side of the aisle, but we
have a lot more unity and fewer problems,'' he said.
   For Pat Robertson, Bush's only remaining challenger, there were
new problems. The Internal Revenue Service asked for a court
hearing Tuesday on whether Robertson's campaign had complied with
IRS demands for documents in a complicated investigation of the
former television evangelist's organizations. The campaign said it
has complied.
   Yet another declaration from non-candidate Mario Cuomo also
roiled the waters. This time, politicians tried to judge the impact
of the New York governor's roundabout confirmation over the weekend
that he would reject a draft at the Democratic convention in July.
   With Jews expected to make up nearly a quarter of the Democratic
primary voters in New York, Israel and Middle East policy have held
the spotlight in the primary campaign with 255 delegates at stake.
   Dukakis went before the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations in New York to give his first
extended discussion of the violence in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
   ``It is critically important that the world understand who is
responsible for the turmoil and the violence,'' Dukakis said in his
prepared remarks. ``It is, regrettably, Arab leaders themselves who
have time and again rejected the chance to sit down with Israel and
negotiate peace.''
   ``It is not the generation of young Palestinians,'' Dukakis
said. ``It is not a government in Jerusalem that struggles to
maintain order while seeking an opportunity to negotiate with
responsible Arab leaders about the future of the territories.''
   On Monday, Jackson distanced himself further from PLO leader
Yasser Arafat, with whom he met in the late 1970s. He had said
Sunday that the PLO and the Palestinian people are not the same and
that he would not meet again with Arafat.
   ``It would not be a good approach to start at the table with the
most extreme elements. That's a formula for catastrophe,'' Jackson
said when asked to expand on his comments on Arafat.
   Gore, who had strongly criticized Jackson on Arafat, called that
``a very useful statement'' and vowed to continue his style of
drawing contrasts between himself and Dukakis and Jackson.
   ``By raising the issues openly, instead of just behind the
scenes...it makes it a healthy process and creates opportunities
for questions and answers that break new ground,'' Gore said. `` I
know I have grown during this campaign. I know the other candidates
have.''
   Earlier in the day, Gore admitted that he must do well in the
New York primary.
   ``We're running to win here,'' he said. ``But at a minimum, we
have to have a finish which convinces'' observers that ``Gore did
it. He has the momentum and he has the strength to go on.''
   On the Middle East issue, Gore repeated his opposition to an
independent Palestinian state, saying the preace pocess should
follow the Camp David agreements that foresaw an area carved out
for Palestinians with limited autonomy.
   ``I'm for a peace process that could result in a change of
status of the West Bank on terms that could be worked out by
parties involved in the Middle East,'' Gore said, adding quickly,
``It's unthinkable to have an armed, military, hostile presence so
close to a vulnerable point in Israel.''
   Cuomo once again stirred the political pot this weekend by
saying that he does not want to be the choice of a deadlocked
Democratic convention and, in so many words, rejecting such a
possible draft.
   That was not news to Gore.
   ``I always heard his words clearly. I thought he wasn't a
candidate because he told me he wasn't a candidate,'' the Tennessee
senator said.
   Perhaps the quickest reaction was from New York Mayor Ed Koch _
at odds with Cuomo in recent days _ who said he would endorse Gore
or Dukakis this week.
   In the all-important delegate contest, Dukakis continued to hold
a small lead over Jackson. The AP delegate count gave Dukakis
745.05 and Jackson 709.55. Gore trailed with 395.8, while 514.35
were uncommitted. Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who has suspended
his campaign after a string of poor showings, had 171.5.
   At the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta in July, 2,082
votes are needed to win the nomination.

<HEAD>Hijackers of Kuwaiti Jet May Have Smuggled Weapons Through Service
Ramp</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hijack, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weapons aboard a hijacked Kuwaiti airliner
may have been smuggled aboard in Bangkok through the ramp area used
by caterers and cleaning crews, an International Air Transport
Association official said Monday.
   ``On the basis of discussions we've had so far, the probability
is weapons were placed on board the aircraft through the coercion
or collusion of staff on the ramp,'' said Rodney Wallis, head of
security for the association.
   Caterers, engineers, cleaners and loaders all have access to the
ramp area where the cabin of the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 was
serviced and cleaned before it left Bangkok on Tuesday, he said.
   Thai authorities have not completed their investigation, he
added.
   There are believed to be at least five Arab hijackers on board
the jumbo jet, which was commandeered Tuesday on its way to Kuwait
and has been sitting on the tarmac in Larnaca, Cyprus, since Friday.
   The hijackers have killed two passengers and threatened to kill
the remaining passengers if authorities do not fulfill their demand
that the plane be refueled. About 45 hostages are being held.
   Wallis said he thought the weapons were placed on board through
the ramp area because it is highly unlikely five people could take
guns and grenades through security gates at Bangkok airport.
   The International Air Transport Association is a Montreal-based
international association of commercial airlines.
   ``The initial reaction of the Thais was, `it couldn't have
happened here,''' Wallis added. ``But the most logical place for it
to have happened was while it was on the ground in Thailand; it was
on the ground there for a considerable period.''
   Paul Sheppard, head of the security section of the International
Civil Aviation Organization, said the operation was obviously well
planned and the weapons could have been smuggled aboard any number
of ways.
   Security ``is like a great spider web over the whole world, and
there's no way of plugging up every single little gap,'' said
Sheppard. ``The chain of security is only as strong as its weakest
link.''
   The plane was bound for Kuwait from Bangkok on April 5 when it
was seized by the hijackers, who demanded the release of
pro-Iranian terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait.
   The jumbo jet was forced to land in northeastern Iran, where 57
people were released. The aircraft then left Iran and landed in
Larnaca on Friday after being refused permission to land in Lebanon
and Syria.
   The Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization is
a United Nations agency that sets international standards and
regulations for safe air transportation.

   Two Sikh extremist groups on Monday ruled
out peace talks with the government unless they focus on the
radicals' demand for an independent nation.
   Also Monday, police reported five more people killed in the
6-year-old guerrilla war for a Sikh homeland in the northern state
of Punjab. Authorities have blamed Sikh extremists for killing
nearly 700 people, mostly Hindus and moderate Sikhs, since the
start of the year.
   The five-member Panthic Committee and its 11-member Council of
Khalistan, a subgroup, said Monday that anyone who negotiated with
the government and did not demand Sikh independence would be killed.
   ``No one will be allowed to negotiate with New Delhi for less
than Khalistan,'' the Panthic Committee said, using the name Sikh
extremists have given to their would-be nation.
   ``The struggle for Khalistan is being fought in an organized
manner, and whosoever comes between the Sikhs and Khalistan will be
taken care of,'' the group announced in a statement at the Golden
Temple in Amritsar, the holiest shrine for Sikhs.
   Jagar Singh, a spokesman for the groups, read their statements.
Members of both the Panthic Committee, formed in 1986, and the
Council of Khalistan, created in October, generally operate
underground. Many of them are wanted on sedition and murder charges
by the government.
   The Panthic Committee claims it is the official voice of the
Sikh separatists, and has rejected the authority of traditional
Sikh institutions.
   The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million people but constitute a majority in
Punjab.
   Indian government officials have repeatedly said they are
willing to discuss grievances of the Sikh community but ruled out
any discussion of independence.
   The militants' statements came a day after Jasbir Singh Rode,
chief priest at the Golden Temple, told the United News of India
that he was willing to explore negotiations with the government.
But he said militants ``do not seem interested in talks with the
government at present.''
   The separatists' statements appeared aimed at undercutting Rode,
who has called for a gathering of Sikh faithful on Wednesday in
southern Punjab.
   The Council of Khalistan's statement reiterated an assertion by
several militant groups that the radicals were not responsible for
the recent surge in attacks on Sikh families.
   The statement blamed the attacks on ``the black cat commando
force,'' a special unit created to guard Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi. It said the slayings of Sikh moderates were aimed at
discrediting the militant movement.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of teachers demonstrated
Monday against Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as
Panama slid further toward chaos in the seventh week of an economic
and political crisis.
   American business executives tried to figure out how they were
affected by new U.S. sanctions that could cost Panama millions of
dollars.
   The sanctions prohibit U.S. businesses from making payments,
including taxes, to the Panamanian government. Panama is virtually
bankrupt because of a run on its banks, the freezing of Panamanian
deposits in U.S. banks and a variety of American sanctions aimed at
forcing Noriega to resign.
   Protesting teachers, who along with 100,000 other public
employees have not been paid fully in more than a month, gathered
in front of the Ministry of Education and shouted anti-Noriega
slogans for several hours before dispersing without incident.
   ``Pineapple face, you must go,'' they cried in a mocking
reference to Noriega's jowly, pockmarked face.
   Commerce and Industries Minister Mario Rognoni said Monday after
a meeting with more than 30 representatives of American companies
that Panama planned to be flexible with firms affected by the U.S.
sanctions.
   However, he said if the companies do not pay utility bills
because of the U.S. executive order, their services would be cut.
   ``It is a delicate situation for which we are looking for a way
to help the American companies continue operating in Panama,'' he
said.
   Fred Denton, executive director of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Panama City, said he had received numerous calls from
representatives of U.S. firms asking how the tax sanctions would be
applied.
   ``If we take this to the letter of the law, I wouldn't be able
to buy a Panamanian postage stamp,'' Denton said. ``We're in a
complete state of confusion.''
   President Reagan on Friday invoked the sweeping economic
sanctions law against Panama to force the ouster of Noriega, the
commander of the 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind
the civilian government.
   The Treasury Department in Washington was expected to issue
guidelines this week covering the sanctions imposed under the 1977
International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended
the steps as an attempt to deny Noriega ``money that could be used
to perpetuate his stay in power.''
   Noriega repeated his claim that the U.S. actions are an attempt
by Washington to renege on the treaty that will turn over full
control of the Panama Canal to his country at the turn of the
century.
   ``They want to rewrite history, cancel the treaties by imposing
a government controlled by them and reversing the social
achievements made since 1968,'' he told the Paris newspaper Le
Monde in an interview published Monday.
   Asked if his departure from the country would end the crisis and
alleviate the suffering of Panamanians, Noriega said: ``If the
people are suffering, it is because of the United States, not me.''
   Panama's crisis began when Noriega had the National Legislature
depose President Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26, the day after
Delvalle tried to fire the general. The United States still
considers Delvalle the legal head of state.
   Noriega is under federal indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, which he denies.
   In Caracas, Venezuela, a Panamanian opposition leader forced
into exile said Panama will start running out of basic foodstuffs
in days and such a shortage could lead to the ``final push'' to
remove Noriega.
   Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra arrived in Caracas Sunday night
from Panama City after 11 days in prison. He was imprisoned after
leading a protest march and said authorities told him he could
either remain in jail or go into exile.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Gonzalez urged Latin
American nations to abandon their opposition to U.S. economic
pressures designed to remove Noriega.
   ``We have been successful in that in ten months we have taken
away all Noriega's support without shedding blood. What he needs
now is a final push, and this could be when the economic situation
grows sharply worse in the next few weeks, basically for a lack of
food,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, an author, teacher
and critic of the medical establishment, is dead at age 61.
   Mendelsohn, who died April 5 at his home in Evanston after a
brief illness, wrote the books ``Confessions of a Medical
Heretic,'' published in 1979, and ``How to Raise a Healthy Child In
Spite of Your Doctor,'' published in 1984.
   Mendelsohn also wrote a syndicated newspaper column, `The
People's Doctor.''
   ``He was probably the nation's most vocal critic of organized
medicine,'' said Jay Hathaway, executive director of the Bradley
Method of Natural Childbirth, a California-based group on whose
advisory board Mendelsohn served.
   ``He served as a kind of catalyst for many different
organizations'' that question medical orthodoxy, Hathaway said.
``My favorite quote of his is, `You should kick the hospital habit
at birth.'''
   Mendelsohn was a professor and instructor of pediatrics at the
University of Illinois and Northwestern University. He also taught
at Loyola University medical school.
   He was a former director of development at Chicago's Michael
Reese Hospital and a former national director of Project Head
Start's medical consultation service.
   Mendelsohn is survived by his wife, two daughters and six
grandchildren, his mother and two brothers.

   President Chaim Herzog may further reduce the
sentences of three leaders of a Jewish terror group that operated
for four years in the occupied territories, Israel radio reported
Monday.
   Herzog's spokesman, Ami Gluska, said in a written statement that
``all such reports are baseless.''
   The radio said the president is considering reducing the
sentences of Menachem Livni, Shaul Nir and Uzi Sharbaf, Jewish
settlers who staged a gun and grenade attack at the Hebron Islamic
College that killed three Palestinians and wounded 33 in August
1983.
   They were sentenced to life in prison in July 1985 but Herzog
reduced their punishment last year to 24 years each. Several
right-wing political leaders have appealed to Herzog to pardon the
men.
   The radio said the president was considering a further reduction
of their terms in honor of Israel's 40th anniversary.
   The three settlers were among 25 arrested in 1984 and charged
with planning and conducting six attacks against Arabs in the
territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
   On April 1, Herzog ordered the freedom of two other people
convicted of taking part in the group's activities. Gluska called
the move part of ``a general trend to reduce sentences in the
framework of the 40th year of the state.''
   One of those freed was New York-born Ira Rappaport, who was
serving a two-year sentence for helping to plant a bomb in the car
of then-Nablus Mayor Bassam Shaka in 1980. Shaka lost his legs in
the attack.

   Three black men were fatally
shot and the fourth was stabbed to death in separate attacks near
the southeastern coastal city of Durban, police said Monday.
   The killings in the Hammersdale area outside Durban were
announced in the Monday morning police report which covers
incidents during the previous 24 hours. The report gave no
additional details on the killings.
   At least 16 people were injured by guns, knives and fighting
when rioting broke out Sunday at an overcrowded black music
festival in Durban, police said.
   Police said they fired shots in an attempt to control the crowd
at Kings Park rugby stadium, which seats 50,000. Approximately
120,000 people attended the festival, which began at midday and
lasted about six hours despite the scattered violence.
   Black unrest has declined sharply in South Africa in the past
year.
   The only area reporting regular flare-ups in recent months has
been the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg, where about 500
people have died in black factional feuding since the beginning of
1987.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Former Spokesman Says He Manufactured Quotes For Reagan</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Adds one graf Speakes comment that making up quotes is not
lying.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House spokesman Larry Speakes
says in a new book that on two occasions he attributed to President
Reagan remarks on crucial international issues that the president
did not make.
   Speakes says that in 1983, in the aftermath of the shooting down
of a Korean Air Lines plane with 61 Americans aboard, he credited
the president with statements made by Secretary of State George
Shultz.
   He also says that during Reagan's summit meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985 he attributed to
Reagan remarks that he and an assistant press secretary, Mark
Weinberg, manufactured.
   Speakes, who has often boasted that he never lied to the press
during his six years as Reagan's chief spokesman, makes the
statements in his book, ``Speaking Out,'' scheduled for publication
next month by Charles Scribner's Sons.
   Reagan cut short a vacation at his California ranch to return to
Washington and meet with the National Security Council and with
congressional leaders after a Soviet plane shot down the KAL
aircraft on Aug. 31, 1983.
   Speakes says in his book that Shultz declared during the
congressional leaders' meeting that the incident was not a problem
between the United States and the Soviet Union but ``a Soviet
versus the world problem.''
   In meeting with reporters, the former spokesman says, he ``did a
little improvising on my own.''
   ``Since the president had had almost nothing to say during the
National Security and congressional leadership meetings, I made
presidential quotes out of Shultz' comment about the incident
pitting the whole world against the Soviet Union, as well as some
of Shultz' suggestions about what retaliatory steps we should
take,'' Speakes writes.
   ``My decision to put Shultz' words in Reagan's mouth played well
and neither of them complained.''
   In his account of the Geneva summit, Speakes says he ``felt that
Gorbachev was really getting the advantage over us in his
give-and-take with reporters, while Reagan was very tentative and
stilted'' in his comments.
   ``Fearing that Reagan was losing the media version of Star Wars,
I instructed Mark Weinberg to draft some quotes for the
president,'' Speakes says. ``I polished the quotes and told the
press that while the two leaders stood together at the end of one
session, the president said to Gorbachev, `There is much that
divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we are
talking here together.'''
   Speakes says that CBS used the quote in its evening television
news and Chris Wallace of NBC reported ``the talks were frank. The
president's best statement came off camera, aides quoting him as
saying, `The world breathes easier because we are talking
together.'''
   ``Another Reagan quote which we manufactured that received
extensive play in the press was, `Our differences are serious but
so is our commitment to improving understanding,''' Speakes writes.
   ``In retrospect, it was clearly wrong to take such liberties,''
the former spokesman says in his account of the Geneva meeting.
``Certainly, Reagan would not have disavowed the words, but the
Soviets could have said they never heard anything like that.
Luckily, the Russians didn't dispute the quotes and I had been able
to spruce up the president's image by taking a bit of liberty with
my PR man's license.''
   In an interview published in Tuesday's editions of The
Washington Post, Speakes said that making up presidential quotes
``is not lying .... When you're a press secretary, you develop a
bond of understanding with the president so that you think like the
president .... I knew those quotes were the way he felt.''

<TEXT>
   Sean Connery, the quintessential Agent 007 in
such James Bond films as ``Dr. No'' and ``Never Say Never Again,''
won his first Oscar Monday night for his portrayal of the steely
Irish cop in ``The Untouchables.''
   Connery received his second standing ovation of the evening as
he accepted the best supporting actor award, saying ``patience is
truly a virtue.''
   His first standing ovation came at the top of the 60th annual
Academy Awards ceremony when he introduced the visual effects award
amid a spectacular backdrop of cinematic magic.
   In a 30-year film career, which includes about 40 pictures,
Connery's Oscar also represented his first Academy Award nomination.
   Winning created a certain dilemma, Connery said on stage,
because he had promised to give the award to his wife.
   ``This evening I discovered backstage that they're worth $15,000
and now I'm not so sure,'' he said, then added, ``I'm only
kidding.'' The statuettes actually are worth about $200 each.
   He ended his acceptance speech by saying: ``If such a thing as a
wish accompanied this award, mine would be that we ended the
writer's strike.''
   The strike by the Writers Guild of America against movie and
television producers is now in its fifth week.
   Connery was handpicked by Ian Fleming to play James Bond in
``Dr. No,'' and starred in six more of the spy films including
1983's ``Never Say Never Again.'' He also has appeared in such
films as ``The Great Train Robbery'' and ``The Name of the Rose.''
   Connery was chosen for the Oscar from among nominees Albert
Brooks, ``Broadcast News''; Morgan Freeman, ``Street Smart'';
Vincent Gardenia, ``Moonstruck,'' and Denzel Washington, ``Cry
Freedom.''

   A 31-year-old man accused in a double murder in
Pennsylvania slightly injured three New York City police officers
who stopped him in a pickup truck that had been reported stolen,
authorities said Monday.
   Arthur Faulkner of Philadelphia tried to flee then used a
folding knife against pursuing officers in an attempt to fend off
arrest Sunday night, police spokesman Sgt. Ed Burns said.
   Faulkner was charged with auto theft, resisting arrest and
criminal possession of a deadly weapon, Burns said. The three
officers were treated and released at a local hospital.
   Faulkner is wanted on a murder warrant in Pennsylvania in the
April 1 stabbing deaths of Clarice J. Dorner, 30, and Annaliese H.
Killoran, 22, at an archaeological workshop outside Philadelphia.
   Faulkner, a laborer at the site, is also accused of stabbing and

   Iraq flew 15 Iraqi soldiers to England, Austria
and West Germany on Monday for treatment of wounds it said the men
suffered from Iranian chemical weapons during fighting last month.
   The soldiers were sent to European hospitals two weeks after
Iran flew about two dozen civilians to medical facilities in
Western Europe and New York. The Tehran government said they were
victims of Iraqi poison gas attacks in a March 16-17 battle over
Halabja and two other Kurdish town that had been capturd by the
Iranians.
   Iran has repeatedly accused Iraq of using chemical weapons in
the war that began September 1980.
   Iraqi officials denied their country was sending wounded to
Europe to counter the Iranian claims.
   ``We bring the proof now that our soldiers have been hit'' with
chemical weapons, Iraqi Embassy spokesman Abdul N. Isa told The
Associated Press in London. Iraq has said 88 of its soldiers were
wounded in an Iranian poison gas attack in the Halabja fighting.
   Iran has repeatedly denied its forces have used chemical
warfare, which is outlawed by international conventions.
   Five Iraqi soldiers arrived at London's London's Heathrow
Airport on a chartered Saudi Arabian jet for treatment at Brompton
Hospital, a private clinic in west London.
   Four doctors accompanied the injured. The soldiers, on
stretchers, were wrapped tightly in blankets and only their faces,
some burned, were visible.
   Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Sadiq al-Mashat was at the airport to
meet them.
   Ten Iraqi soldiers were flown to Vienna aboard a special Saudi
Arabian flight.
   Five were admitted to Vienna's General Hospital and officials
said the five others were flown on to West Germany for treatment.
   The Austria Press Agency said the men taken to the Vienna
hospital were not in critical condition.
   They were met at by Iraqi Ambassador Wahdi Al-Qaraguli who said
the cost of their treatement would be paid for by his government.
   Twelve days ago, the British Foreign Office indicated it
believed Iraq had used poison gas in the fighting at Halabja and
filed a protest with the Iraqi ambassador.
   Iran has said 5,000 people were killed and 5,000 injured by
Iraqi chemical weapons in the fighting for the Kurdish towns.

   Jesse Jackson, referring to Yasser Arafat as one
of the ``most extreme elements'' in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, called Monday on Jewish and Arab Americans to start
Middle East peace talks in the United States.
   ``Talks can, in fact, begin right here in this country,''
Jackson said.
   His proposal came as the New York presidential primary campaign
entered its final week.
   Nearly one quarter of the Democratic electorate on April 19 will
be Jewish and for many of those voters, the future of Israel is a
critical issue.
   Jackson appeared to be reaching out to Jewish voters on Sunday
when he declared that as president he would not meet with Arafat,
whom he has been criticized for meeting several years ago.
   At a breakfast meeting on Monday, he also ridiculed suggestions
that he would come under greater scrutiny as a result of the
electoral successes that have placed him only a handful of
delegates behind Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts in the
Democratic race.
   Running third in the three-candidate race was Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee.
   Jackson, the former civil rights activist, said there had been
suggestions that the news media and the other candidates would get
tough with him.
   ``Well, get tough,'' he said. ``Who else has a budget for
fighting the drug crisis?
   ``Who else has a budget deficit plan?
   ``Who else has significant foreign policy experience?''
   And then he said, ``I look forward to tougher days.''
   Jackson was asked about Arafat and he said, ``It would not be a
good approach to start at the table with the most extreme elements
_ that's a formula for catastrophe.''
   Instead, he said, ``In this city some of your top Palestinian
leaders in the world live. Some of your top Jewish-American and
pro-Israeli leaders live. We should begin to talk here, to implore
both sides to a higher level of security.''
   He brushed aside questions about whether he would meet with the
Council of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, a group
Dukakis spoke to on Monday. He said he also was addressing concerns
of Haitians living in New York, of people from the Caribbean, as
well as of Italian and Irish Americans.
   Later, an aide said Jackson had no room on his schedule to meet
with the Jewish group.
   Monday evening, labor leaders and the rank and file turned out
in force at a labor rally in support of Jackson's candidacy.
   The candidate was interrupted repeatedly with shouts of ``Win,
Jesse, Win!'' _ an updated version of the ``Run, Jesse, Run!''
slogan chanted during his unsuccessful first run for president in
1984.
   Jackson told about 5,000 supporters at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center that blue-collar workers ``will have a friend in
the White House'' if he becomes president.
   Jackson reminded the crowd, which represented a wide
cross-section of the labor movement, that he has stood with them
many times on picket lines, and asked them to stand with him now by
supporting his candidacy.
   Jackson also campaigned north of the city, addressing a rally at
Rockland Community College and greeting workers at a General Motors
plant in North Tarrytown.
   At the college he urged students to ``seize that leadership. ...
Young America must lead.''
   At the GM plant he sounded his familiar theme of battling
economic violence and told the workers, ``We built our campaign at
the plant gate.''

   Federal housing officials today announced
plans to find out how many black and Hispanic couples are victims
of ``racial steering'' or other discriminatory treatment in their
search for places to live.
   The first major study of housing discrimination in a decade
would use hundreds of white, black and Hispanic couples as bogus
house-hunters to test the nation's metropolitan rental and real
estate markets.
   ``Racial steering'' occurs when agents steer minorities away
from all-white residential areas.
   ``Despite advances in civil rights, discrimination still exists,
in more subtle ways than before, in many areas,'' said Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce in requesting bids to
conduct the study. The deadline for bidding is May 26, with the
study expected to be completed in mid-1990.

   President Reagan on Monday directed Secretary
of State George P. Shultz to go to Geneva to sign ``historic
accords'' by which the United States and Soviet Union will
guarantee a peace agreement dictating the removal of all Red Army
troops from Afghanistan.
   Reagan called the pact a triumph for the U.S.-backed insurgents
after a bloody, eight-year war with the Soviet-supported Kabul
regime. He said the rebels ``can count on our continued support.''
   The rebels have rejected the peace pact and have vowed to
continue fighting. Under a compromise with Moscow, the United
States will continue sending weapons to the rebels, while the
Kremlin continues providing arms to the Marxist government.

   Astronomers have found the oldest and most
distant galaxy ever seen, an object 10 times the size of the Milky
Way that formed when the universe was less than 2 billion years
old, researchers said Monday.
   ``The important thing is that the galaxy appears to be rather
old,'' said its discoverer, Simon Lilly of the University of Hawaii
at Manoa. ``Even though the universe was only a few billion years
old at the time we're looking at this, the galaxy itself was 1
billion or 2 billion years old. So this pushes back the time at
which galaxies formed in the early universe.''
   The discovery could force a revision in astronomers' conception
of the universe, Lilly said. ``If we find more objects like this,
the cold-dark-matter scenario will be in trouble,'' he said.

   U.S. Roman Catholic bishops on Monday released

   The 164-page document recommended that women play more of a
leadership role in the church and suggests further study of the
possibility of installing women as permanent deacons.
   It also said girls should be allowed to join altar boys in
assisting priests, saying that exclusion of girls seems ``to stand
in contradiction to our call for women's more direct involvement in
the life of the church.''

that he no longer feels bound ``by the code of `omerta''' _ or
silence.
   The code of silence is now broken frequently, said John C.
Keeney, acting chief of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.
``When the going gets tough, the smart change sides,'' he said.
   FBI officials, who also testified before the Senate Permanent

organized crime families is less extensive, although many
individual mobsters are linked to narcotics.

workers,'' said a Rand Corp. report released Monday.
   More than 1,000 bills were introduced and hundreds enacted in
legislatures across the country during the past decade boosting
teacher pay and tightening rules governing training and
certification.
   But that produced more contradiction than direction, concluded
the 80-page report, ``The Evolution of Teacher Policy,'' by Linda
Darling-Hammond and Barnett Barry of Rand's Center for the Study of
the Teaching Profession in Santa Monica, Calif.
   They said policymakers have so far failed to resolve the key
question: whether teachers are professionals ministering to the
individual needs of students, or ``semiskilled workers'' needing
constant supervision and regulation.

<HEAD>Taiwan's Geriatric Parliament Set For Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the geriatric world of Taiwan's
Parliament, lawmakers have been dying this year at the rate of two
a month, and the Young China Party has a representative who is 74.
   The Legislative Yuan, the highest of the three lawmaking
branches of Parliament, is populated by scores of octagenarians and
nonagenarians elected in 1948 on the Chinese mainland. Many are
hospitalized today and cannot attend sessions, including
97-year-old Chao Chu-hsu, the senior member.
   Six members died in the first three months of 1988, lowering to
306 the number of mainland-elected lawmakers still in the 884-seat
body at the end of March.
   The aging lawmakers were part of the Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalist mainland government, which was forced to flee to Taiwan
a year later by the victory of Mao Tse-Tung's Communists in the
civil war. Chiang died in 1975 at the age of 87, and Mao died in
1976 at 83.
   The Nationalist leaders on Taiwan still claim to be the rightful
rulers of all China and have frozen the lawmakers elected in 1948
into office until the government can return to the mainland to hold
new elections. Starting in 1969, however, Taiwanese were allowed
seats in the legislature.
   But with native Taiwanese seeking a greater say in today's
government and the mainland-elected lawmakers becoming increasingly
feeble, the Nationalists are facing calls to take the gray out of
the Legislative Yuan.
   ``Over the past 40 years the (Nationalist Party) has never paid
enough attention to the voice of the people,'' said Chu Kao-cheng,
a lawmaker from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. ``The
whole constitutional structure is distorted and destroyed.''
   In February, the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, proposed
voluntary retirement for the remaining mainland-elected lawmakers
and an increase in the number of seats open for election on Taiwan,
which now stands at 73. The proposal also would apply to the
934-seat National Assembly, the branch that meets every six years
to choose Taiwan's president. The other legislative branch is the
Control Yuan, which serves as a watchdog.
   The opposition party has denounced the Nationalist plan,
however, arguing that all seats, including those of the
mainlanders, should be open for election.
   In the meantime, Chu and 11 other opposition party members
elected in 1986 are making life miserable for the aging lawmakers.
Most of the mainland-elected members belong to the Nationalist
Party but some belong to smaller groups, including 74-year-old Liu
Tzu-peng of the Young China Party.
   Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers constantly refer to the
elderly members as ``old thieves.'' They also get into fights with
the Nationalists, rip apart furniture and generally cause chaos
whenever possible during Legislative Yuan sessions.
   The 33-year-old Chu's exploits in this have earned him the
nickname ``Rambo'' in the local media.
   On April 7, Chu stormed the Legislative Yuan podium to stop a
vote on the budget. He wound up in a wild melee with several
Nationalists that resulted in a decision to provide the Legislative
Yuan's aging president and vice president with bodyguards.
   The mass-circulation United Daily News said that among those who
punched and kicked Chu during the scuffle were several elderly
Nationalist lawmakers who ``had suppressed their displeasure for
too long.''
   Opposition lawmakers recently have taken to the streets to
protest the ``10,000-year Parliament'' and in March led a group of
more than 1,000 people to a walled suburban compound where many of
the aging Nationalists live. At least 16 people were reported
injured when demonstrators clashed with the security forces.
   Opposition party members also have publicized the telephone
numbers of mainland-elected representatives and have urged people
to call them to demand they retire.
   Nationalist lawmaker Chang Hung-hsueh, 72, said he receives one
or two calls late each night. Some callers curse while others
remain silent, he said. He added that he receives paper money
traditionally offered to the dead with his name on it.
   ``This is shameful (and) mean, but it does not bother me,''
Chang said in a recent interview. He said he always replies to the
callers with a polite: ``Thank you. I am still alive.''
   Chang believes that holding elections in Taiwan for the entire
Legislative Yuan would be unconstitutional on grounds that it would
become a local lawmaking body. His belief is shared by other
mainland-elected representatives.
   But reform of the parliamentary system was firmly pushed by
President Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek's son who died at the
age of 77 in January, as part of his sweeping policy to introduce
democratic change to the island.
   His successor, President Lee Teng-hui, is a firm supporter of
the voluntary retirement package and final details are expected to
be announced in coming months.

<HEAD>Libya Swarms with `Guests' _ Including Californian with a Cross</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The writer, who is based in Rome, recently was a
``guest'' in Libya and took notes for this story while waiting
around, as guests often must do.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A guest in Libya _ and there are guests
galore _ does a lot of waiting, but there's always the
entertainment of watching other guests.
   Recently there was the man who identified himself as Arthur
Blessit from Southern California.
   He showed up one day pulling a wooden cross on wheels and said
he's been doing that for the past 19 years in all parts of the
world.
   He told a Libyan television crew he and his teen-age son planned
to pull the cross from Tripoli through the desert to Ghadames, 250
miles to the south, near the borders of Algeria and Tunisia.
   When Blessit and his cross rolled out of sight, Heinz Weifenbach
came by the hotel lobby where other guests were waiting around.
   Weifenbach is the burly, mustachioed West German who turned to
Col. Moammar Gadhafi for financing for his ice hockey team back
home, and he said he was waiting to catch a plane to Tobruk, near
the Egyptian border, to hear the Libyan leader make a speech.
   According to JANA, the official Libyan news agency, guests pour
into Libya all the time _ from all over, even from Indian
reservations in the United States.
   Judging by JANA, these ``guests,'' most of them members of
official delegations, don't have a spare moment. They're busy
bringing flowers to Gadhafi, busy touring his barracks-home that
was damaged in the U.S. air attacks in 1986, busy denouncing
``imperialist aggression,'' busy signing guestbooks.
   Libyan officials like to present guests with ``programs.''
Programs are sometimes a tight schedule of hospital tours, factory
visits, maybe even a suddenly arranged late-night chat with ``the
leader,'' as Gadhafi is known here.
   But the programs follow ``Libyan'' time, and ``Libyan'' time
means long waits in hotel lobbies and in airport lounges. Some
guests, frustrated by the waiting, give up and start for home, only
to be yanked back at the plane's door with a promise of an
encounter with the ``leader.''
   But they eventually find out they've returned only for more
waiting at the hotel and looking out over the blue Mediterranean.
   That doesn't sound bad; the trouble is, all you can do generally
is look, since it's difficult to get out the hotel door.
   Journalist guests, for example, are often assigned
``assistants.'' These usually are enthusiastic, but sometimes
sour-faced young men or women who work for the Information
Ministry. They seem to materialize just when the guest is about to
slip out the door for a look around.
   ``Oh, you know, there might be a press conference with the
leader,'' my assistant tells me. ``Maybe an interview. Maybe very
soon.''
   The guest sinks into a lobby sofa and orders another soft drink
or tea; alcohol is forbidden in Gadhafi's revolutionary Islamic
society.
   For a change of pace from lounge lounging, there is corridor
pacing. Many of the pacers in hotel corridors are proponents of
various causes and countries, looking for a sympathetic ear.
   Visitors sometimes feel like they're in a spy movie, with guests
approaching each other stealthily, whispering messages to each
other.
   An Arab man leaned toward a Western woman in the hotel
restaurant and said: ``I have something important to tell you.''
   ``Yes?''
   ``You have nice legs.''
   One sunny afternoon, four Western visitors asked their
assistants for a car to go to Sabratha, site of an ancient
Greco-Roman theater, 45 miles west of Tripoli.
   Yes, maybe, there was a car, but it was broken. It might be
fixed but not for several hours, and the ruins close at sunset.
   The guests turned to the taxi drivers outside.
   Sure, said one. ``Fifteen dinars'' (about $50).
   The Libyan assistants appeared and said something quietly in
Arabic to the driver.
   ``Thirty dinars. Maybe 50,'' said the driver.
   It was clear the assistants didn't want the guests going off
without a program.
   A few days later, JANA reported on the doings of an Austrian
youth delegation.
   The youths went to a poultry factory and to the ruins of
Sabratha, it said.
   They had a program.

<HEAD>Family Awaits for Word of Irishman Missing Two Years in Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after Brian Keenan
disappeared in Beirut, his mother and two sisters say they too have
become hostages to unknown kidnappers.
   ``If they could only let us know whether he's alive or dead _
even if he's dead, it would be better than hoping all the time,''
said his younger sister, Elaine Spence.
   Despite petitions and appeals to the Lebanese people and the
Iranian and Syrian governments, no group has claimed responsibility
for the disappearance of the 37-year-old teacher, who is a citizen
of the Irish republic to the south even though he was born and
lived in Northern Ireland.
   Keenan rushed out of his apartment April 11, 1986, late for an 8
a.m. lecture at the American University in Beirut where he had
taught for four months.
   His mistake, the family believes, was to forget his Irish
passport.
   They believe he was kidnapped by people who may have thought he
was American or British, rather than a citizen of a small neutral
country.
   Ireland's only involvement in the Middle East is through aid
groups and its contingent in the United Nations peacekeeping force
in Lebanon.
   Immediately after Keenan disappeared, the Irish government in
Dublin issued photographs of his passport and repeatedly broadcast
that he was an Irish citizen, raising the family's hopes that he
might be released quickly.
   But two years later, Keenan remains the only Irishman among the
22 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   His family is resigned to an indefinite wait for his return.
   ``We still feel he's alive and we're not going to give up
hope,'' said his older sister, Brenda Gillham. ``We never thought
it would last as long as this, but we're going to keep on fighting
until we see him released.''
   Ireland's ambassador to Iraq, Patrick McCabe, who is also
accredited as the envoy to Lebanon, was quoted in Dublin's Sunday
Press newspaper April 3 as saying: ``People we have talked to do
not think Mr. Keenan is dead.'' He added, the newspaper reported,
that hostages could be held for years without their captors making
contact, and ``that gives us some hope.''
   The only reported sighting of Keenan came from a French hostage,
Camille Sontag, 85, who was freed in November 1986. He said one of
the five Westerners held with him in an underground prison in south
Beirut by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems slipped him a piece of paper
on which was written: ``I am Irish. Please tell my family.''
   Keenan's sisters and his 65-year-old mother, Minnie, were
encouraged by Sontag's message, but disheartened this past March
when Nabih Berri, leader of the Lebanese Amal militia, said that
because he had heard nothing about Keenan, he feared him dead.
   A photograph of Keenan and a scrapbook of news clippings about
all the hostages in Lebanon have a special place in Mrs. Gillham's
tidy living room in a state-subsidized development in east Belfast.
   ``It's not only the hostage himself that's held, his family's
held hostage as well,'' she said. ``In our own home, you're afraid
to go out in case the phone rings. If you go out for a night out,
you feel guilty, the fact that you might be trying to enjoy
yourselves and Brian's sitting in a cell somewhere.''
   Belfast-born Keenan had lived in the turmoil of sectarian strife
that has gripped Northern Ireland for nearly 20 years.
   A Protestant, he chose to become a citizen of predominantly
Roman Catholic Ireland rather than of Britain, which governs the
province. Everyone born in Northern Ireland has the option of
becoming a citizen of either.
   In addition to teaching, Keenan was a community worker for the
Belfast City Council.
   ``He has many Protestant and Catholic friends,'' said Mrs.
Gillham. ``He tried to build communication on both sides. He loved
his country.''
   Mrs. Spence said the family did not want his kidnapping to
become a political issue.
   In December, two senior officials from Sinn Fein, the legal
political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, went to
Beirut without the family's knowledge to try to win Keenan's
freedom.
   Mrs. Gillham said it was the similarities between Northern
Ireland and Lebanon that attracted her bearded, easy-going brother
to Beirut.
   ``When he told me he was going, I said to him, `Are you sure you
know what you're doing? It's like going from the frying pan into
the fire.'
   ``But as Brian said, there's a war there. There's a war here at
home and life has to go on.''

<HEAD>West Germany Says Communist Spies Still Flocking In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even though East-West relations have
thawed, communist espionage is on the rise in West Germany and
probably is aimed more at high-tech industrial secrets than
military or political ones, officials say.
   West Germany has been infested with communist spies since its
creation in 1949 in the ashes of World War II. The spying has
ranged from East German truck drivers rolling through the
countryside to moles in the highest of government offices.
   Among the most important spies caught were Guenter Guillaume,
who wrecked Chancellor Willy Brandt's government in 1974; Margret
Hoeke, who was a secretary to five presidents; and Manfred Rotsch,
who delivered top-secret NATO documents to the Soviets.
   But just last month, West German federal police arrested 11
people suspected of working for the KGB, the Soviet intelligence
agency, and are investigating others.
   ``The large number of arrests confirms that instead of
refraining from activating agents in a time of detente, the East
bloc is intensifying its espionage activities,'' Interior Minister
Friedrich Zimmermann told reporters after the March sweep.
   Hans-Gert Lange, spokesman for the Office for the Protection of
the Constitution, West Germany's counter-espionage agency, said
warmer East-West relations increase the opportunities for spying.
   ``The thaw has increased interest in obtaining information, and
also improved conditions for espionage,'' Lange said in an
interview at his Cologne office.
   Lange added that because some communist countries have loosened
emigration restrictions, a danger increases that agents have been
planted among the refugees.
   ``Emigration plays an important role in espionage in the Federal
Republic (West Germany), as has been shown by the arrest of the
suspected KGB agents,'' Lange said.
   Among the 11 suspects arrested in March were four Soviet emigres.
   With communist research lagging behind the West in many areas,
Soviet bloc agents have intensified their efforts to obtain secrets
from private companies in science and high-tech fields, Lange said.
   ``The interest in political secrets is still great, but for
technological and scientific matters it has grown considerably,''
Lange said.
   Security officials estimate that as many as 3,000 spies are at
work in West Germany, most of them from East Germany. Between 30
and 50 suspected spies are arrested each year, the
counter-intelligence office says.
   Secretaries and other government employees in Bonn, the nation's
capital, are among those who have been caught.
   Also, security officials have long suspected that East German
truckers driving through West Germany report on military movements
and gather other information for the East German secret service.
   But a spy can come from anywhere.
   West Germany automatically grants citizenship to all ethnic
German refugees from the East bloc, making the task of isolating
communist agents extremely difficult.
   In addition, West Germany and East Germany have improved
relations over the past few years, resulting in more contacts
between the two sides and greater chances for espionage.
   East German authorities have allowed the resettling of its
citizens to West Germany to increase dramatically, reaching a high
of 30,000 in 1984, compared to just 7,000 the year before,
according to federal statistics.
   Past spy scandals have damaged the nation's image among other
NATO allies.
   West Germany arrested 16 communist agents in 1976 after cracking
East German infiltration methods. But it turned out that two of the
spies, Lothar-Erwin Lutze and his wife Renate, had been passing
NATO documents to East Germany since the 1960s. West German Defense
Minister Georg Leber resigned over that scandal.
   In 1974, Guenter Guillaume, a close aide to Chancellor Brandt,
was exposed as an East German agent, and Brandt resigned.
   Guillaume began serving a 13-year jail sentence in 1975 _ the
longest ever given by a West German court to a convicted spy _ but
he was released six years later in an exchange of agents with East
Germany.
   In 1985, the Constititution Protection Office itself was rocked
by the defection to East Germany of Hans-Joachim Tiedge, who headed
an agency group responsible for catching East German spies.
   Security officials believe many of the communist agents in West
Germany now can do only minor damage.
   ``But one must be careful when one uses the term `small fish',''
said Lange. ``A small fish can always become a bigger one.''

<HEAD>Mystery of the Missing Nuclear Scientist Captivates Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disappearance of a leading nuclear
scientist has Taiwanese fuming at the United States and worrying
about damage to their national security.
   Newspapers carried unconfirmed reports after Col. Chang Hsien-yi
vanished in mid-January that he worked for the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency and might have turned over nuclear secrets to
the Americans.
   Chang was a deputy director of the official Institute of Nuclear
Energy Research. He disappeared while on leave from his post.
   ``We immediately looked at this map, maybe he fell off a
cliff,'' said Liu Kuang-chi, secretary general of the government
Atomic Energy Council, as he moved to an office wall map of Taiwan
and traced a route along rugged interior roads.
   But several local newspapers provided a different scenario for
Chang's disappearance, reporting that he was a CIA informant who
left for the United States with details about a Taiwanese nuclear
weapons program.
   A U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis E. Oakley said in
Washington last month that the department had no comment on whether
Chang was an informant for the United States.
   In Taipei, David Hess, spokesman for the American Institute of
Taiwan, which oversees U.S. interests here, has told the government
and local media the institute has no idea of what happened to Chang.
   Taiwan officials have repeatedly denied plans to build a nuclear
bomb. Communist China has said the production of atomic weapons by
Taiwan would be reason to invade the island, which Beijing regards
as a renegade province.
   Nevertheless, the uproar over Chang has increased anti-American
sentiment that already was brewing here because of Washington's
tough trade talk with Taiwan, which last year had record $16
billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Although the United States in 1979 broke diplomatic relations
with Taiwan and recognized the Communist China government,
Washington remains the island's major trade partner and arms
supplier. The American Institute of Taiwan serves as an operative
diplomatic and commercial link in the absence of an embassy.
   ``I get a lot of hot reaction from my students,'' said Su Chi, a
member of the Institute of International Relations who also teaches
at National Chengchi University. ``Until this point there's always
been a huge reservoir of good will toward the United States ... but
I think the reservoir has cracked.''
   The Taiwan media, which has given intense coverage to Chang's
disappearance, also has criticized the United States.
   A March 25 commentary in the mass-circulation China Times said
that no matter what the motive, ``the act of stealing our defense
secrets has invaded our national sovereignty and respect to a
certain degree. ... No one can interpret this as friendly
behavior.''
   Taiwan officials now believe Chang is in Washington. They have
asked the United States for information about him but the Reagan
administration claims it does not know his whereabouts.
   Deputy Foreign Minister John Chang recently said Taiwan cannot
lodge a protest with the United States because ``we don't have
evidence showing U.S. government or CIA involvement.''
   But Jaw Shau-kong, a maverick lawmaker from the governing
Nationalist Party, is demanding retaliatory action.
   The government ``probably should expel some (U.S.) diplomats
from Taiwan, expel some CIA; it cannot keep silent,'' said Jaw, who
views the United States as an imperialist nation.
   Jaw said he fears Chang took important military secrets,
possibly classified information about Taiwan's missile development
program. Jaw added that he wonders if such material could fall into
the hands of Communist China.
   Liu, the nuclear energy official, noted that many of Chang's
classmates worked on missile and airplane projects at the
military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology.
   The government maintains, however, Chang did not take any
sensitive information from Chungshan. Liu believes the missing
scientist did not have access to such secrets even though he knew
of work done by the Nuclear Energy Research Center staff for
military-related Chungshan projects.
   Professor Su believes Chang's disappearance is unlikely to cause
a serious re-evaluation of Taiwanese-U.S. relations but could
eventually lead to public debate of the country's nuclear policy.
   In early April, the mass-circulation United Daily News newspaper
published a poll that indicated Taiwan was split over the
development of nuclear weapons.
   According to the survey, 35 percent of the 767 people polled by
telephone said Taiwan should make atomic bombs while 34 percent
were against such a policy. The poll, with a margin of error of 3.5
percentage points, indicated most people believe Taiwan is capable
of making the weapons.
   Nearly three-fourths of the respondents said that if Taiwan
developed nuclear weapons they should not be used against mainland
China.

   Excellence in Education set off alarms with a provocative report
that warned of ``a rising tide of mediocrity'' in U.S. schools. The
man behind that report, Terrel H. Bell, says he never expected such
a stir. But now he fears the school reform movement has left behind
the bottom 30 percent of America's children _ the poor, the
minorities, the dropouts.

<TEXT>
   T.H. Bell, considered by many to be the father
of the school reform movement, views himself as a failure when it
came to educating the most important pupil he ever faced: Ronald
Reagan.
   Three years after he quit the Reagan Cabinet, Bell frets that
school reform ``didn't do a darn thing'' to solve the problem of
dropouts and those who can barely read the words on their high
school diplomas. Most are poor; many are minorities.
   ``We're losing 30 percent to 40 percent of the rising
generation,'' says the former Secretary of Education. ``They're out
of school and they're unemployed and unemployable.''
   It might have been different, he says, if President Reagan had
taken to heart the message of the bombshell report that Bell
commissioned, ``A Nation At Risk.''
   The National Commission on Excellence in Education made
headlines on April 26, 1983, with its blunt warning: ``The
educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded
by a rising ride of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a
nation and a people.''
   Reagan responded by extolling tuition tax credits and prayer in
public schools _ two things that ``A Nation A Risk'' never touched
upon.
   But the president and his advisers soon realized that it made
political sense to pay more attention to education. Reagan began
visiting schools and speaking out about the need for tougher
standards for students and teachers alike.
   Bell, who had come to Washington to preside over a department
Reagan had promised to abolish, began traveling with the president
on Air Force One and handing out ``flags of excellence'' to schools
at White House ceremonies. Governors and business leaders took the
school reform message to heart and began pouring more dollars into
local school budgets while seeking to hold educators more
accountable.
   Republican Party chief Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. called Bell ``the
second-most important man in this administration.'' And, in perhaps
the ultimate compliment, Reagan, who had sought to cut billions
from the education budget, actually proposed a modest budget
increase in 1984, an election year.
   But when that election was over, Bell says the White House sent
word that Reagan would try with renewed vigor to boot education out
of his Cabinet. Bell submitted his resignation and returned to Salt
Lake City to teach at the University of Utah.
   Now he has written a book, ``The Thirteenth Man: A Reagan
Cabinet Memoir,'' that lays bare his struggles within the
administration and the regrets that set in after he left it.
   ``I tried to convince the president and his people of the bonds
that tie together education, the economy and military strength. But
notwithstanding the fact that I had been a teacher for much of my
adult life, I never succeeded in getting this lesson across to
them,'' Bell wrote.
   Bell, in his book, made no mention of his successor, William J.
Bennett, who has been a forceful advocate of tougher standards for
schools and colleges, and has made his own headlines with studies
comparing U.S. and Japanese schools and proposing a core high
school curriculum.
   But Bell thinks the Reagan administration reponse in the second
term has been inadequate.
   ``Bennett has very effectively used the bully pulpit,'' Bell
said in an interview. ``But for some reason the response hasn't
been such as to rally the whole nation around this _ the fact that
we're losing a third of the whole nation to academic deficiency and
illiteracy. I'm not talking about Bennett so much as I am about
Ronald Reagan.''
   ``We missed an opportunity to fully take advantage of `A Nation
At Risk' and all the attention on it by not giving it a high
priority and a high profile in the second term,'' Bell says. ``Had
the president done that, the results of the reform movement would
have been much more impressive than they are.''
   Bell credits Reagan with moving the country ``away from the
drift toward the welfare state and highlighting the strength of our
capitalist, free enterprise system.'' But, Bell adds, ``He could
have added to that by being the president who turned around and
solved the American education system. We can't say that now.''
   Bennett, asked about the Bell book at a congressional hearing,
said ``The Thirteenth Man'' suggests Bell was the ``only virtuous
man in the administration and the rest were knaves and louts.''
   ``Unlike Bell, I won't leave the job and then go write a book
criticizing the people for whom I worked,'' Bennett said.

   Bell takes no comfort from the education rhetoric he has heard
from the presidential candidates, including promises from both
George Bush and Michael Dukakis that they will be ``the education
president.''
   ``We should be asking the presidential candidates: `If elected,
what do you plan to do to lead the nation into a truly great
education system and to transform America into a learning
society?'''
   Even before it was published, ``The Thirteenth Man'' made
headlines with Bell's claim that he heard ``mid-level right-wing
staffers in the White House and at OMB'' make racist jokes and
ethnic slurs. Bell has never named names.
   The book recounts Bell's bitter, often losing struggles within
the administration on budget, personnel and policy with people whom
he regarded as conservative ideologues.
   Conservatives regarded Bell as a mole of the education
establishment in the Reagan Cabinet, a big-spending liberal who had
testified in 1978 in favor of creating the Education Department.
   If they needed any evidence to support those views, Bell
provides it in abundance in ``The Thirteenth Man.''
   ``Those who accused me of being part of the educational
establishment were right,'' said Bell, who had served two previous
stints in Washington, one as U.S. commissioner of education in the
Ford administration, between school posts in Utah.
   Bell calls for $25 billion in new federal, state and local
spending on the Chapter 1 remedial program for disadvantaged
students, Head Start, the pre-school program for poor children, and
the Job Corps.
   He said the country should attack the problems of illiteracy and
dropouts with ``a national movement of the magnitude of the
Marshall Plan that helped rebuild the war-ravaged nations of Europe
at the end of World War II.''
   But, he says, ``money by itself is not the answer. We cannot
ignore the other part of education, and that's the home and
family.''
   Bell's own life story is testimony to the power of both
education and the family.
   Bell grew up in poverty in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho. His father
died in an accident in 1929 when Bell was 8. His mother, Alta
Martin Bell, raised nine kids in the Depression on virtually no
money.
   When he graduated from high school as valedictorian he wore a
suit that, without his knowledge, Mrs. Bell had bought with money
donated by his teachers. He headed off to the college with the
lowest tuition in the state, Albion State Normal School. It charged
$11.50 per semester.
   ``My life at Albion opened richnesses beyond anything I ever
imagined,'' he recalls. ``I was ignorant of our own history and of
the great literature of the Western world. I knew nothing of the
Federalist Papers, the works of Tolstoy, or the rudiments of
economics. This all came to me courtesy of the taxpayers who
founded and supported a state normal school to prepare teachers to
teach their children and grandchildren.''
   It also came courtesy of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New
Deal and the Congress, which supported the part-time National Youth
Administration job that paid him $17 a month _ enough to cover his
$4 rent and leave $13 for food, which his mother supplemented by
mailing four loaves of bread every Wednesday.
   His experiences at Albion, now defunct, made it all the harder
for Bell to support Reagan cuts in student aid, cuts he now says
were ``absolutely wrong.''
   Bell said that when he left Washington to return to Salt Lake
City, ``I had a nagging feeling of betrayal..I felt frustration at
not having been able to secure an enduring commitment to the cause
of education at the highest federal level.''
   On the positive side, he says, ``we are educating 60 to 70
percent of the youth of America better than in previous decades.''
College-entrance test scores have stopped sliding, states have
raised high school graduation requirements dramatically and
installed competency tests for both students and entry-level
teachers, and ``at least 30 states have taken steps to build career
ladders for teachers that reward distinguished teaching
performance.''
   But, he says, then there are the bottom 30 percent to 40 percent
of students for whom the push for school reform ``didn't do a darn
thing.''
   ``In my mind,'' he adds, ``nothing could have assured Ronald
Reagan's place in history more than his enduring commitment to the
school reform movement that he supported so effectively for 18
months, only to abandon it after the election.''
   ``Failure to educate millions of our people adequately will move
us toward disaster if we do not alter course,'' he warns.

<HEAD> EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a pilot program that began this year in Dade</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   County, Fla., which encompasses Miami, local schools are given more
autonomy and teachers themselves help make the decisions. The final
grades aren't in yet, but it looks like the program is getting good
marks.

<TEXT>
   When school administrators sit up and pay attention
to what teachers have to say, students learn more.
   That's the theory behind a pilot program in Miami and the rest
of Dade County that has educators across the country taking notes.
   ``We people on the front lines _ and we really are on the front
lines _ have a real contribution to make,'' says Linda Lentin, a
first-grade teacher at North Miami Elementary and Dade County's
teacher of the year, a classroom instructor with 30 years of
experience.
   School-based management and shared decision-making are the
cornerstones of the program implemented by the Dade County School
Board and United Teachers of Dade in the fourth-largest school
district in the country, with 255,000 students in 260 schools.
   Other elements of the program include a proposal to improve
inner-city schools by involving various community organizations,
Saturday classes, a satellite kindergarten in an insurance company,
and various professional growth initiatives.
   But the decision to give schools more say in their own
management, with input from teacher committees, is the most
fundamental of the reforms, which had the enthusiastic support of
the teachers union.
   Last spring, 53 schools designed programs detailing how they
would make decisions normally handed down from a central or
regional office, concerning such things as budget, curriculum and
schedules.
   Eighteen elementary schools, 10 middle or junior schools, four
high schools and one adult education center were chosen to
participate in the four-year program that began this school year.
   ``The people that are the closest to making the decisions as to
what needs to be done to educate the kids _ we're talking about the
teachers _ are actively involved in that process,'' says Elliott
Berman, principal of Southwood Junior High.
   The concept of teachers committees participating is
revolutionary, according to Pat Tornillo, executive vice president
of the teachers union.
   It's put Dade County at the cutting edge of educational reform,
says Joseph A. Fernandez, superintendent of schools.
   ``People across the country are looking on in amazement,''
Berman said recently, just before he left for Acapulco, Mexico,
with three other Dade educators to discuss what's happening here.
   Dade officials have been invited to cities across the United
States to explain the program, and interest has been expressed from
as far away as Japan, says Lynn Shenkman, a spokeswoman for Dade
Schools. Educators from elsewhere also come to Dade to see the
innovations, she says.
   ``We have a lot of people that come in and marvel,'' says Larry
Feldman, principal of Palmetto Elementary School.
   Feldman says that since the program was implemented enrollment
has jumped from 360 to 480, volunteers have increased and
businesses are proposing school projects.
   Palmetto, which was 25th in attendance among Dade's 178
elementary schools, moved up to first place with 97.4 percent
average daily attendance record.
   Since parents had expressed dissatisfaction with the school's
Spanish program, the committees proposed hiring teachers from
Berlitz language school, one of the more widely publicized changes
in Dade.
   Teachers also decided it would be better to spend money on aides
rather than a part-time assistant principal. But the most important
change, members of a five-person steering committee unanimously
agree, is something they call ``flip-flopping.''
   Under the scheduling innovation, classes are divided into
thirds, twice a day. One third might go to music class and another
third to library. The classroom teacher then gets to teach basic
skills to a very small group of children.
   ``We're able to really work with them and give them the
individual help they need,'' says Bobbie Z. Davis, a fourth-grade
teacher on the steering committee.
   ``When we're flip-flopping, we don't have discipline problems,''
says Mercides Hunter, the school's union steward who chairs the
steering committee and teaches third grade.
   Carole Wiener, who chairs the school's scheduling and curriculum
committee, praises the flip-flop for another reason: It enables her
to teach ``Social Studies Through Art,'' a specialized class she
developed under school-based management.
   The changes initiated by teachers have varied widely from school
to school.
   At Mrs. Lentin's school, a common dismissal time was adopted for
all grades for the safety of younger children who previously had to
wait for older brothers or sisters to get out of school.
   In Berman's school, teachers outlined major objectives for the
school year, including closing the minority achievement gap,
infusing critical thinking throughout the curriculum, increasing
teacher expectations, encouraging handicapped students to stay in
school and improving standardized test scores.
   In Bunche Park Elementary School in Opa-locka, mildly
handicapped students now have a housekeeping lab to learn how to
take care of themselves and elaborate report cards come out every
six weeks instead of every nine weeks.
   Charles Hadley Elementary in western Dade County came up with a
new way of hiring good teachers: Let teachers themselves do the
hiring.
   ``Our current teachers interview prospective teachers,'' says
Hadley Principal Menia Stone. ``Oooh, they're tough. They ask
questions I wouldn't dare ask.''
   Six new teachers have been hired so far and Stone has not gone
against her teachers' recommendations once.
   Hadley is also offering sixth-graders two elective courses on
Friday afternoons, when students can take drama, advanced
computers, video productions, geography and other courses not
normally offered.
   ``School-based management is the kind of program teachers have
dreamed about for years,'' says Merri Mann, a professional issues
specialist with the teachers union.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ No one ever confused ``Thunder Road,'' the
Jacksboro Highway, with the French Quarter or the Vegas Strip, but
for a generation or two of rowdy Texans, it was a little bit of
both. Now the party's almost over.

<TEXT>
   It was a gaudy mix of burglars,
bootleggers and billionaires, rogues and royalty, whores and hit
men. Rednecks and roughnecks and college kids on the prowl.
   It was cold beer and hot dice and warm summer nights dancing
under the stars at Lake Worth.
   It was murder and mayhem, cops and robbers, rhythm and blues and
the big band sounds of Billy May and Paul Whiteman.
   It was the Rocket, the Skyliner, the Black Cat, the Showboat,
the Barrel, the Casino, the 3939, the Four Deuces, the Cocoanut
Grove, the Bad Liquor, Massey's and the lure of a young baby-faced
stripper named Candy Barr.
   It was Jacksboro Highway, or Texas 199, a neon ribbon of revelry
flowing northwest out of Fort Worth toward Azle, Jacksboro, Wichita
Falls and Amarillo.
   In its heyday, a 10-mile stretch of that highway was a symbol of
the state's rough-and-tumble heritage and a playground for the
brave, bold, adventuresome and foolhardy.
   The lights flickered and dimmed years ago. And now the party's
about over.

   As a youngster growing up on Jacksboro Highway, Pat Kirkwood
scrambled atop the roof of his dad's gambling joint on Saturday
nights and assessed the economy by activities along the road below.
   ``If it was a three-ambulance evening, money was a little
tight,'' he recalls. ``But seven or eight ambulances meant
everything was OK. People were out spending money and boozing and
brawling.''
   Kirkwood, 60, called them the ``good old bad days.''
   Well, the good old bad days are gone, and so is the Jacksboro
Highway of yesteryear. And what's left of ``Thunder Road'' is about
to give way to a new eight-lane freeway.
   A victim of urban growth, changing lifestyles and its own wicked
reputation, Jacksboro Highway has become in recent years something
of a toothless lion and a bit of an eyesore.
   The new freeway, with a 1990 start date, may cut down the few
remaining landmarks and provide the final nail in the coffin of a
wild and woolly era.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The stories are legion, an intriguing blend of fact and fiction,
a bit of myth and more than a dash of truth. Anyone who's been
there is an expert on Jacksboro Highway.
   Listen...
   Robert White: ``When they widen that highway, they'll probably
find a whole bunch of skeletons.''
   Cliff Helton: ``Liquor laws? Practically nil. Everyone had a
bootlegger.''
   Carolyn Miller: ``They weren't all killers. They just loved to
fight.''
   Jess Johnson: ``There were more cathouses up and down the
Jacksboro Highway than you could shake a stick at.''
   Cleon Nettles: ``When someone got too big for his britches, he
just disappeared...and they'd find him in a well.''
   Johnny Cabluck: ``I'd drive my wrecker out to pick up their
cars, and I'd take pictures of the murder victims for the sheriff's
office.''
   Bobby Eubanks: ``The further you went, the badder it got. You
could get in to anything you were big enough to handle.''
   A customer at Massey's Club 21: ``I really liked the old Tower
Motel. The popular phrase was, `Let's go to the Tower for an
hour.'''
   Bill Magnussen: ``There was more perverted sex on the parking
lot of the Albatross Club than in any of the motels along the
highway.''
   Byron Matthews: ``You ever hear of Elmer Sharp? Nobody ever
whipped him. I don't mean he was such a good fighter, he was just
tough.''
   A customer in the Scoreboard: ``Elmer Sharp was so tough he
wrestled his pet bear. But his mama was tougher.''
   Another customer at the Scoreboard: ``One-eyed Shirley Parker
once put out a cigarette in a guy's ear. The guy came up with a
knife...''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   At roughly 2:30 one morning, a Jacksboro Highway club owner who
demands anonymity left the Scoreboard lounge after attending a
wedding party for a friend. In the parking lot, two punks stuck a
knife to his throat, took his money and his ring, roughed him up
and left him lying on the ground.
   ``We ought to kill you,'' said one.
   ``You damn sure should,'' the victim gasped.
   The assailants laughed and left.
   Later, after paying $250 to a stoolie, the club owner tracked
down one of the muggers outside a beer joint. Luring him into his
darkened car, he ``extracted'' an eyeball and a substantial number
of teeth and shot off both of the guy's kneecaps. Then he dumped
him in front of a hospital and drove away.
   Noticeably impressed by the Jacksboro justice, the second
assailant fled to Canada and has not been heard from since.

   Once, after a string of burglaries up and down the highway, the
same club owner got a cot, a washtub full of beer and a 12-gauge
shotgun and lay in wait nightly for the bandit to return.
   It was not a long wait. The burglar crawled through an opening
in the roof and dropped to the floor. The first thing he saw was
the club owner, who shot both his legs off.

   At Inez' 5050 Club, Inez herself is reminiscing about the good
old bad days, fretting over the new highway and complaining
lightheartedly that at age 69 she's having difficulty finding a new
husband.
   ``I'm looking,'' she says. ``I don't want to die alone.''
   ``How many husbands you had?'' wondered a customer.
   ``Nine,'' she replied. ``And that's not counting repeats and
licenses I didn't use.''
   Besides the sparse spousal straits, Inez is also unhappy about
Jacksboro Highway's tarnished image. She insists it got its
reputation dishonestly, blaming all those messy, headline-grabbing
shootings, stabbings and bombings.
   ``I've never had a shootin', a cuttin' or even a real good fist
fight. I always thought they had more trouble on Camp Bowie
(Boulevard) than we ever had out here,'' she says.
   Carolyn Miller, manager of the 5050, says she's spent all her 41
years along the Jacksboro Highway and that her father, Billy Don
Smith, introduced her to the rowdy side of life at an early age.
   ``My dad loved to fight,'' she smiled. ``He didn't go out to
drink; he went out to fight.''
   Billy Don got word one night at the Green Room that a stranger
was hitting the Jacksboro Highway honky-tonks claiming to be the
toughest guy in Texas. He found him at a club that Carolyn said was
so rough ``they issued you guns and pool sticks whether you needed
them or not.''
   He stormed through the door and shouted: ``Where's the so-and-so
who says he's the meanest man in Texas?''
   ``That's me,'' the stranger growled.
   Billy Don knocked him over the pool table.
   ``When he wakes up,'' he told the bartender, ``tell him the
toughest SOB is back at the Green Room.''

   Tincy Eggleston was not the toughest of the Jacksboro Highway
regulars, but he ranked right up there with the meanest. Like his
buddies Cecil Green and Gene Paul Norris and several other world
class thugs, Tincy had a high tolerance for violence.
   At 2:10 a.m. on May 3, 1955, Tincy and Cecil Green were busy
examining the fruits of an extortion caper when two gunmen opened
fire on their car parked outside a Jacksboro Highway nightspot.
   Tincy escaped in a fierce gunbattle, but Green was fatally
wounded and died the next day.
   Unfortunately, Tincy later had a serious falling out with Gene
Paul Norris, perhaps over the loot from a robbery linked to a Cuban
weapons deal. Norris killed Tincy, blew his head away in fact, and
dumped his body in a well.
   Old Gene Paul spent an extraordinary amount of time in trouble
himself, none worse than what occurred on April 29, 1957. That day
he and a pal named William Humphrey were rehearsing a scheme to rob
the Carswell Air Force Base payroll.
   Incidentally, the Jacksboro Highway was off limits to Carswell
personnel, in part because someone finally figured out that
cowboys, cedar choppers, cold beer and Yankee flyboys were a
volatile mix.
   At any rate, an army of law enforcement officers that included
the police chief, the sheriff and the Texas Rangers interrupted the
robbery rehearsal and chased Gene Paul and his crony out the
Jacksboro Highway nearly to Springtown.
   After wrecking their car, the two desperadoes exchanged gunfire
with officers as they fled on foot along Walnut Creek. Both were
gunned down and died at the scene.

   Pat Kirkwood claims he was born in the back room of the 2222
Club while a crap game was in progress up front.
   ``I grew up in a strange environment,'' he quips.
   He and others of his era maintain that Pappy Kirkwood's club
enjoyed a reputation not only as a squeaky clean gambling den but
also a place where the rich and powerful could eat, drink and wager
in private.
   That group, Kirkwood said, included Dick Kleberg of the vast
King Ranch family, U.S. House Speaker Sam Rayburn and big game
hunter Frank Buck.
   ``They were our house guests all the time,'' he said. ``Pop
would close the gambling joint sometimes and he and Sam would knock
down about two quarts of Jack Daniel's a day. I didn't know much
about politics, but I knew this was a powerful man.
   ``It was a gambling joint and maybe a little illegal, but Sam
and the others were comfortable there. Pop had New York strip
steaks flown in and served the finest duck and geese and the best
cigars.''

   The Four Deuces also provided a shot in the arm for the local
economy, he said, considering the amount of whiskey, turkeys and
hams Pappy Kirkwood dispensed to his special friends.
   Most were cops.
   ``My daddy was a little smarter than some gave him credit for,''
Kirkwood said with a crooked grin.

   Aside from Tincy Eggleston and his crowd, among the best-known
and best-liked figures on the Jacksboro Highway were a gambler, a
sheriff and a man who probably has owned more clubs than anyone
along the strip.
   That in itself says much about the Jacksboro Highway.
   The gambler was of course Pappy Kirkwood, who died in 1983, and
the sheriff was the late Sully Montgomery, who friends say winked
at the law when it came to gambling, girls and illegal booze but
would not tolerate ``serious'' criminal activities.
   Those same friends concede that Sully raked off a generous
amount of the cash flowing up and down the highway, but they
maintain he was a ``first cousin to Robin Hood'' and shared his
wealth with the less fortunate.
   It is not clear, however, who those less fortunate were.
   But for sheer dash, color and staying power, few could rival
Cliff Helton, whose clubs included the Cocoanut Grove, the Magic
Lounge, the Barrel, the Sugar Pool and the Thunderbird.
   ``I owned the Barrel seven different times,'' says Helton, 72,
who in the good old bad days was known as mayor of Jacksboro
Highway.
   Helton met and mingled with the best and worst of the Jacksboro
crowd and knows a great deal more about the Strip than he's willing
to tell for the record.
   He took a reporter on a recent tour of the highway, pointing out
such landmarks as the Skyliner Ballroom where stripper Candy Barr
performed and the spot where Tincy Eggleston and Cecil Green were
ambushed.
   Helton explained how a gambler survived an intricately conceived
house bombing behind the original Chenault's Drive-In only to be
gunned down later on Watauga Road.
   It was back down the highway at the Albatross Club that Helton's
buddy, Junior Dodd, celebrated his last birthday. A gambler best
known to reporters and lawyers for his home-smoked barbecue, Junior
was shot to death shortly after leaving the party.
   Helton's tour that evening took him past the Chateau, once a
gambling palace called the 3939 Club, and out to Lake Worth and
Casino Beach, site of the grand old Casino Ballroom.
   ``In the 1950s, that was the nicest place on the Jacksboro
Highway,'' recalls a 50-ish Beverly Nettles, who grew up on the
north side. ``They had all the big bands, and you could dance
inside or outside.
   ``Thirty years ago, at that age, that was the place to be. The
Skyliner and the Rocket were raunchier.''
   Helton noted that a car lot stands now where first the Ring Side
and later the ultra-plush 400 Club provided late-night and
after-hours dining and dancing downstairs and gambling upstairs.
   Retired State Judge Byron Matthews says the 400 Club flourished
in the 1930s and 1940s with name bands and top floor shows and what
may have been the first pre-cut steaks in Texas.
   ``It was first class,'' said Matthews, who earned a reputation
as the best criminal trial lawyer in town by defending more than
100 accused killers, a sizeable number of them from Jacksboro
Highway.
   Helton's tour took him finally to Massey's Club 21, which holds
the oldest continuous beer and wine license in Tarrant County and
is probably the oldest business establishment on Jacksboro Highway.
   Opened in 1934 in an old streetcar, Massey's today is the
quintessential Texas roadhouse with its neon beer signs, leather
bar stools, Tombstone pizza and dancing on Wednesdays, Fridays and
Saturdays to a group called The Jacksboro Highway Band.
   Hanging behind the bar is a 1936 photograph of a dapper Cliff
Helton standing beside a wrecked Ford coupe.
   Laughing, Helton recalled the time years ago when a drunk
entered one of his clubs and asked where he could get a bite to
eat. Helton directed him to Massey's.
   A short time later, the phone rang. It was Massey.
   ``Cliff, don't you ever send me no more business!'' he wailed.
   The drunk had driven his pickup truck through a wall into
Massey's kitchen.
   Massey's widow, Adrian, is still a Jacksboro Highway fixture and
his son-in-law Bobby Sitton now runs the club.
   Bemoaning the pending freeway, told a reporter, ``It looks like
they're going to put us out of business..They're tearing down
tradition here.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They live in a cluster of towns in the suburbs
of New York City, a mixed-race people not fully accepted as whites,
blacks or Indians. But leaders of the Ramapo Mountain People insist
they are descended primarily from the Lenni Lenape Indians
indigenous to the region and have asked the federal government to
recognize them as a bona fide tribe. At stake are some economic
benefits, not the least of which is prospects for a lucrative bingo
business.

<TEXT>
   From atop Manhattan's World Trade Center,
you can just about see Chief Ronald Redbone's homeland.
   Redbone and a 2,800-member tribe of the Ramapo Mountain People
live about 30 miles away, beyond the broad waterway that Henry
Hudson claimed for the Dutch in 1609, beyond the suburbs and
department stores of northern New Jersey, beyond too the great
highways and metropolitan traffic pulsing through the jet-streaked
smog.
   There live Redbone and his people, in the bosom of the Ramapo
Mountains, on the edge of the din. Professional shingles are few,
and many eke out marginal livings as mechanics, domestic help,
school bus drivers and the like. Much industry that once bolstered
their community, like the Ford Mahwah plant where Redbone worked
for 28 years, has left for more desirable locations.
   The community is a cultural eddy of mixed-race people not fully
accepted as whites, blacks or Indians. ``My grandfather was wearing
a three-piece suit while Indians out West were still shooting bows
and arrows,'' Redbone says.
   The chief is leading his people's effort to wrest formal
recognition as a bona fide Indian tribe from a wary U.S. government
by year's end. Community leaders say such recognition could
eventually translate into increased public assistance, millions in
profits from high-stakes bingo games which are allowed on Indian
reservations, and jobs for many of the tribe's idle young people.
   Some Ramapo people also hope it will put to rest forever the
identity crisis of their community, reviled as inbred and dangerous
by many outsiders and grasping at fleeting threads of a heritage
disputed by anthropologists.
   ``We've been recognized as a little bit of everything but what
we want to be recognized as,'' says Nicholas Van Dunk of Hillburn,
a village on the New York-New Jersey border where hundreds of
Ramapo Mountain People live. ``We know that we're a mixed people.
But we know too that the strongest part of our background is
American Indian.''
   The Ramapo people, sometimes shy about talking to outsiders, say
they've been victimized by prejudice, the press, and even by
progress.
   ``The characterization they put on us was that we were shifty,
you couldn't go near us, if you gave us a job, we'd rob you,''
Redbone says. ``If somebody would tell the truth, not make out like
we were going to doggone skin you alive, it would be a lot easier.''
   Also known as Ronald Van Dunk, Redbone is a first cousin and
neighbor of Nicholas Van Dunk. Van Dunk mailboxes line the streets
of Hillburn. You also see many De Freeses, De Groats, and Manns.
   In fact, in order to be accepted as a tribe member, a person
must either carry one of only six family names or one of his
ancestors must have, the chief says.
   The Ramapo people, who live mainly in three communities
straddling the New York-New Jersey border, have been held in
contempt by many outsiders for inbreeding.
   ``It's one of the few communities you go through where
two-thirds of the people have two family names, and the other third
is probably related,'' says a state legislative aide from the area
who asked to remain anonymous.
   Redbone, a handsome man of 55 with ruddy skin, gray hair, and a
Pancho Villa mustache that belies his shyness, dismisses questions
about inbreeding. He's heard them before.
   ``What people don't understand is that not every Van Dunk is
related,'' he says. ``That's been part of the problem. People think
there's incest and all that, but that's not really true.''
   The actual origins of the Ramapo people are obscured by fallible
memory, folklore and prejudice. Knowledgeable people agree the
community represents a complex amalgam of white, black and Indian
heritage.
   Yet the exact racial blend remains disputed with some
anthropological authorities challenging the tribe's mainly oral
account of its own history.
   David Cohen, who directs the Ethnic History program for the New
Jersey Historical Commission in Trenton, argues that Redbone's
people derive from a handful of freed black landowners of Dutch
heritage originally from New York City who eventually found shelter
in the Ramapo Mountains in the early 1800s.

   Cohen made his case in a book, ``The Ramapo Mountain People,''
that he wrote in 1974 after living for several months in the
community. The Handbook of North American Indians, a basic
reference work, accepts his account.
   In his book, Cohen also tried to debunk as folklore a story that
Redbone's people find their beginnings in English and West Indian
prostitutes who escaped from British troops stationed in New York
City. One of the sailors who brought the women was supposedly named
Jackson, and even today some outsiders refer to Redbone's people as
``Jackson Whites.''
   Cohen is now viewed by many in the community as persona non
grata because he argued for the primacy of black, rather than
Indian ancestry. ``I think David Cohen was a little bit out in left
field,'' says Nicholas Van Dunk, Redbone's cousin. ``He had a
racial problem, I think.''
   Though community members present a range of skin tones and
racial features, leaders say Ramapo Mountain families have always
considered themselves American Indians descended primarily from
Lenni Lenape Indians indigenous to the area. They say their
community has always maintained some form of tribal leadership, one
of the criteria they must meet to satisfy the federal government of
their authenticity.
   Today's tribal council includes three members from each of the
Ramapos' main communities, all within about a 10-mile radius:
Hillburn and, on the New Jersey side of the border, Mahwah and
Ringwood. Those three communities also constitute geographically
defined clans: Hillburn of the deer, Mahwah the fox, and Ringwood
the turtle.
   Redbone's own Indian name stems from his people's belief that a
red haze enshrouds the bones of a true Indian.
   But the Ramapo Mountain People need more than their own beliefs
to gain Washington's seal of approval.
   Bud Shapard, branch chief of the Acknowledgment and Research
Division of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, says
it's difficult for many communities to demonstrate to the
government they're Indians. He said they must show, among other
requirements, that they've been viewed by the surrounding
community, other tribes, and state agencies as a separate community
from the first contact with European settlers until the present.
   ``It's a very lengthy process at this time,'' Shapard says. He
notes that his department this year can handle only three or four
of the more than 100 petitions for recognition pending nationwide.
   The Ramapo people have already achieved some acknowledgment from
their states. Both the New Jersey Legislature and the New York
Assembly have recognized them as a legitimate tribe.
   Still, the far-flung Ramapo people must make an especially
difficult argument in order to join the more than 500 federally
acknowledged tribes. Their people, though concentrated in Hillburn
and Mahwah, are strewn from the southern Catskill Mountains of New
York as far south as North Carolina. Even in their New York-New
Jersey border communities, the Ramapo people mingle in varying
proportions with other residents.
   ``Not being on a reservation,'' Redbone says, ``you don't really
get the closeness.''
   The administrative review process can take up to 10 years,
according to the tribe's Washington lobbyist, Charles Blackwell.
The Ramapo people hope to sidestep the difficulties and bottlenecks
at the Bureau of Indian Affairs by pleading their case right to
Congress, which does, in rare instances, act to recognize a tribe
by a simple majority vote of both houses.
   Some local outsiders fear recognition would herald a land claim
by the Ramapo people, similar to those of other New York tribes,
that would put their property in jeopardy. They are uneasy with the
prospect of an Indian reservation exempt from many state and
federal taxes and regulations.
   Following the lead of many tribes around the country, the Ramapo
people hope eventually to derive a hefty income from high-stakes
bingo profits. They have turned to Florida real estate developer
Bob Frank, who's bankrolling the recognition drive with about
$250,000.
   In return, the Ramapo people will let him and another private
investor from the New York City area run the bingo operation. Frank
estimates the games will rake in up to $12 million annually, which
he will split roughly half-and-half with the tribe for the first 10
years.
   ``Naturally, the big thing with this is providing employment for
members of the tribe,'' he says. ``It also provides a living for
me.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ To Cynthia Moss, who spent years in the wilds of
Africa, elephants are special, endearing animals. In her book,
``Elephant Memories,'' she tells why, describing the close familial
relationships and bonding among elephants. ``I want people to know
that so they care enough to save them,' she says.

   Cynthia Moss, native of Ossining, N.Y.,
philosophy major at Smith College and magazine researcher-reporter
for four years, took a five-week vacation when she was 27 to visit
a friend in Africa.
   ``I went to see one of the last wilderness areas, but I ended up
falling in love with the country,'' she says.
   And later with elephants.
   So much so that without any scientific training, she has become
an authority on the elephants of Amboseli National Park in Kenya
and has published an account based on 13 years of observing the
population and its behavior through periods of drought and
scarcity, plentiful rain and overabundance. She watched as
poachers, Masai warriors, injury, disease and tourists interfered.
Some survived. Some did not.
   Her book, ``Elephant Memories,'' tells much about the intricate
bonding among elephants and the elaborate kinship throughout their
lives.
   It's a story of a matriarchal society with rings and rings of
relationships, from the most intense, the mother and her newborn
calf, to the mother and her other immature offspring, through
family units, bond groups and clans.
   Moss was able to observe the canniness of the older matriarchs
in times of drought. Confirming the powers of elephants' memories,
they remembered from previous droughts where vegetation was most
likely to survive and so they managed. In tough times, she found,
elephants break up into smaller groups to forage more effectively.
   She saw that family members will risk danger, charging the
poachers to protect their own, while more distant clan members will
run.
   ``The book is not just about numbers,'' says Moss, director of
elephant research in the park. ``I want people to realize how
special elephants are. How funny, how endearing they can be. I want
people to know that so they care enough to save them.''
   She writes of the elephantine joy as they greet each other after
a separation, or as young males gleefully play-fight with each
other. She writes about elephant grief as the mother of a dead calf
tries to force grass into her mouth to bring it back to life and
tries over and over to hoist it to its feet.
   She writes with wonder about what is going on in their brains as
they come upon the bones of an elephant and minutely inspect them,
throwing them in the air, perhaps to decipher the correct obituary.
   One prestigious critic, who liked the book, accused her of
anthropomorphizing the behemoths.
   ``That's a rather out-of-date thing to say,'' retorts Moss. ``A
scientist would not make that accusation. That is all part of field
work.''
   Moss considers herself lucky for getting a head start in her
field work by being offered a research assistant's job by Iain
Douglas-Hamilton, a pioneer in using extensive photography so that
he could eventually recognize over 500 individual elephants in a
study in Tanzania. Moss worked with him for several years before
embarking on her own.
   ``Today, it would be almost impossible to do it the way I did
it,'' she says. ``For someone with no field experience to get a
paying job would be almost impossible.''
   She estimates that her research, paid for mainly by the African
Wildlife Foundation, the Merlin Foundation and the New York
Zoological Society, probably cost $100,000 for her nearly 20 years
in the wild.
   Moss did not live all alone for long periods, such as Jane
Goodall did initially in her studies of chimpanzees, or the late
Diane Fossey in her gorilla work. Other researchers were nearby.

   ``Because we were all expatriates and interested in the same
things, there was a real camaraderie,'' she says. But she was out
alone most days in her research vehicle following the elephants,
observing, photographing, taking notes that would later be fed into
the computer. The elephants had both descriptive names, such as
Slit Ear, and three-digit code names more palatable to computer
analysis.
   It is still a hard life. Moss suffered through bouts of malaria
and tick fever and was once badly frightened when menaced by a
black mamba, a snake whose bite is fatal.
   ``The thing I don't like about mambas is that they refuse to run
away like any other law-abiding snake,'' she says.
   She has shooed leopards away by shouting at them, endured mock
charges at her vehicle by the elephants and had her camp
``totaled'' by elephants when it was left unguarded and the smells
of fresh bananas and other delicacies overcame whatever inhibitions
they had.
   Moss found love among the elephants a remarkable process. When
bull elephants are in must _ ready to mate _ they show swollen
temporal glands on their cheeks that exude viscous liquid. The
bulls also exude a green substance from the business part of the
anatomy, which she first mistook for some kind of infection or
disease.
   She tells about a young female, a bride the first time, who
didn't know the rules after breeding with a powerful must male. A
more experienced female sticks close to her consort for three or
four days, insuring that less-powerful but greatly interested other
males keep a safe distance.
   This novice kept wandering off from the must male, drawing
instant pursuit from the lesser males, who wouldn't have ventured
close with the must male on hand. He was forced to thunder across
the plain to drive off his rivals.
   Because of the duration of her study, Moss was able to note this
female had learned proper etiquette by the time she was ready to
breed again.
   Some of the interesting tidbits, such as the fact that elephants
also communicate on an infrasonic level, are not directly from
Moss' research, but interwined with other researchers.
   Her decision to pack up and move to Africa years ago was made
easier by the fact that she had no immediate family in the United
States at the time. Both her parents had died and her only sister
was living in Italy.
   She wrote an earlier popular book, ``Portraits in the Wild,''
which deals with the life of a field worker. She has published her
findings in a number of scientific journals, but because she is not
professionally trained, she concedes, she may not get full respect
in some quarters.
   She holds no rancor. ``I can't apply for funds from certain
organizations. I was terribly lucky getting started the way I did.''
   Moss objects strongly to some park's practices of ``culling''
the elephants, killing part of the population to keep the numbers
under control.
   ``Elephants are not so many rodents to be exterminated; they
deserve something better than that and I am not afraid to say that
ethics and morality should be essential considerations in our
decisions for their future,'' she writes.
   ``Killing the elephants seems the simplest and most direct
solution, but only to people who have not watched individuals over
14 years; have not seen the elephants greet one another with
trumpets of joy; seen elephants, adults and calves alike, running
and playing across an open pan in the moonlight; seen elephants
trying to lift and hold up a stricken companion; seen a female
stand by her dead baby for four days; or seen a 7-year-old calf
gently fondle and stroke and feel the jaw of his dead mother.''
   ``I wrote this book,'' she says, ``to share this.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A new ``reconstruction'' era has come to
Louisiana as a result of the oil bust and historical landmarks
throughout the state have fallen on hard times. Many of the
antebellum mansions that were eventually restored following the
Civil War are back on the market because of the economic crunch.

<TEXT>
   After the Civil War, the once-elegant
plantation mansions along the Mississippi River hid their poverty
behind moss-draped oaks, their spacious lawns overgrown with weeds.
   The Reconstruction era saw house after house fall into ruin,
victims of an economy destroyed by the war and the end of slavery.
   Finally, the 1950s brought the oil boom and a stable national
economy and people began looking for ways to invest and enjoy their
money. Homes on the National Historical Register became tax
shelters and those antebellum mansions were purchased by the dozens
and restored.
   Now, a new ``reconstruction'' era has come to Louisiana, one
created by another war of sorts, an economic one that sent the
price of oil to the bottom.
   Historical landmarks throughout Louisiana have fallen on hard
times, especially those operated by the state government, which
faces an accumulated deficit of $2 billion.
   And many of those proud old mansions are back on the market.
   One of them is owned by O. J. Daigle, who remembers trudging
down the dusty river road as a youngster, with little money and no
thought of a future, past a wonderful old house named Tezcuco.
   Daigle eventually prospered because his mother sold newspapers
to send him to college. He bought Tezcuco, which was built in 1855
by a Mexican War hero, and restored it to its original grandeur.
   ``When I was a boy I hated what had happened to Tezcuco,'' says
Daigle, a retired major general who headed the Louisiana National
Guard and made his fortune in real estate and the auto business.
``The owners put a tin roof on the house because it was cheap and
they'd keep painting it different colors _ green, red, you name
it.''
   Alas, Tezcuco is up for sale again, with a price tag of $1.9
million, along with another mansion Daigle owns in Natchez, Miss.
   ``It's the economy. Times are bad and it's a buyer's market,''
sighs Billy Wilcox, whose St. Francisville real estate firm is also
trying to sell other antebellum homes.
   History is taking it on the chin in other ways, too.
   Across the state, the museum system has been cut from over $3
million in operational funds to $1 million and even the famous
Cabildo in the French Quarter _ seat of government in 1795 _ is
open only on a part-time basis.
   ``Not all of our buildings are open. The ones operating are open
Wednesday through Sunday,'' said state Museum Director James F.
Sefcik. ``The Cabildo is open on that basis. We just don't have
enough staff. But, these are tough times and we have to recognize
that.''
   Roy Boucvalt, a Wyoming physician, has offered to donate
Mintmere Plantation, dating from 1857, to an Iberia Parish cultural
district if the district will assume a $237,000 mortgage on the
land.
   But the parish, like the state, is hurting for money and has not
yet taken up Boucvalt on his offer.
   And, across the Mississippi River from Daigle's Tezcuco, the
awesome Oak Alley can be bought for just under $5 million.
   ``They were good tax shelters and they still are,'' says Zeb
Mayhew, one of seven heirs joining a foundation to sell Oak Alley,
which is perhaps the most picturesque home in the state.
   The highlight of the place is the lane leading to the front
entrance, one created by 28 live oak trees thought to be up to 250
years old.
   More than 70,000 tourists paid $5 each to visit Oak Alley last
year and those fees plus bed-and-breakfast money pay for the
day-to-day operations, Mayhew says.
   However, he says, the mansion doesn't take in enough money to
pay for major maintenance work.
   The house and outbuildings are owned by a foundation set up to
take donations to preserve Oak Alley. ``But people aren't as
interested in saving old houses as they are in helping the poor,
the starving,'' Mayhew says. ``I certainly understand that.''
   Nearly all antebellum homes are open to tourists for fees and
many of the owners take in bed-and-breakfast guests.
   But not all of the homes command the big prices.
   In downtown St. Francisville sits Propinquity, built in 1809 and
used in the Civil War as a sanctuary for Confederate soldiers, who
stayed in the cellar as the Union Army rolled by. The asking price
is $250,000.
   ``Times are bad and I just can't afford the notes,'' says
Clifford Wilcox, the owner.
   His real estate firm also is trying to sell Rosebank, built in
1808 and used as an inn for travelers on the Natchez Trace. The
two-story estate with stately columns can be purchased for
$750,000, Wilcox says. The 10-acre estate also includes two smaller
houses.
   Daigle wants $250,000 for the antebellum house in Natchez. ``It
was owned by Governor Holmes,'' he says. ``He was governor when
Mississippi was a territory. I had it open for tourists but closed
it years ago because I couldn't find a good manager.''
   Daigle and owners of the other properties aren't worried about
ultimately selling the houses because there are many people around
the nation like Frances Kermeen, who owns The Myrtles in St.
Francisville.
   ``I'm from California and I took a trip down the Mississippi
River about nine years ago on a steamboat,'' Kermeen says. ``I
heard this house was for sale and knew immediately it was for me.''
   Kermeen left what she called ``a mellow'' California lifestyle
and settled in at The Myrtles, which was built in 1796 by General
David Bradford, who fled his native Pennsylvania after leading the
ill-fated 1794 Whiskey Rebellion.
   ``I live in this house. I love it here,'' Kermeen says.
``Sometimes I won't leave the house for a week.''
   She operates a bed-and-breakfast operation, gives guided tours
and has plans for a large hot tub on the grounds for guests.
   ``I'm fortunate,'' she says. ``I have other sources of income. I
can afford this lifestyle.''

   Nearly five years after it was written,
``Chess'' has found its way to Broadway.
   The musical has survived the illness and death of its first
director, Michael Bennett; technical and set problems that nearly
capsized the London opening, and a confusing flurry of on-again,
off-again announcements about its New York production which fed
speculation that ``Chess'' had been checkmated for good.
   ``It has been slow, but I don't think that really matters,''
says Tim Rice, the man who wrote the lyrics and co-authored the new
book for the $6 million musical, which mixes a love triangle with a
U.S.-Soviet chess match.
   ``It's very important to get things right. This time, it's just
a regular ordinary panic,'' Rice laughs. ``But every show goes
through that.''
   The other day, before the first Broadway preview, the genial,
43-year-old Englishman was sipping coffee in a Madison Avenue
hotel, happy that the postponements are in the past.
   ``The only reason `Chess' has been delayed, in all honesty, was
because of the tragedy of Michael Bennett,'' he says. ``When
Michael got ill, we lost our director with 12 weeks to go before
the London opening. We had this enormous set and show and no one
quite knowing what to do with it.''
   Trevor Nunn, the man behind ``Cats,'' ``Les Miserables'' and
``Starlight Express,'' stepped in to supervise the West End
production. He was up against an expensive and recalcitrant
computerized set involving scores of television monitors.
   The tinkering by technicians was frantic but everything was
finally made to work. The show, which opened in May 1986, became a
sizable hit and is still running.
   ``Trevor had saved us, but he then was totally booked up for the
best part of two years,'' Rice says. ``We thought it was best to
wait for him for Broadway.''
   While the show waited, Rice and others refined the show. Several
new songs were added to the score which has music by Benny
Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, two members of the rock group ABBA.
Playwright Richard Nelson came aboard to help redo the book. More
spoken dialogue was added.
   ```Chess' is not based on anything else,'' Rice says. ``It's not
an adaptation of a classic or a piece that has no story whatsoever.
It's not meant to be just a spectacle. It's meant to be a story.''
   The expensive London set designed by Robin Wagner was jettisoned
for New York. The English production on Broadway would have cost
$12 million and require a two-year run just to pay back its
investment. But there were other reasons that Wagner reworked his
design.
   ``I think we got carried away in London with the set, which was
fantastic, but which took away from the plot,'' Rice says. ``It
made a lot of the situations seem unreal. You'd see songs that were
being sung in some futurist bathroom and what we were just trying
to do was tell a story about real people.''
   ``Chess'' is Rice's first Broadway musical without Andrew Lloyd
Webber, his partner in three consecutive Broadway successes _
``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' ``Evita'' and ``Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.''
   Rice commuted to Sweden during much of 1983 to work with
Andersson and Ulvaeus on the score. Recording sessions began in
Stockholm and London late that year with a cast _ Elaine Paige,
Tommy Korberg and Murray Head _ that would eventually appear in the
London stage version.
   Releasing the show on record was a tactic Rice and Lloyd Webber
had used to great success with ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and
``Evita.'' It allows songs from the show to find a public.
   When ``Chess'' was released as a two-record set in late 1984,
several numbers proved popular, particularly ``One Night in
Bangkok.''
   ``In America, they played it as a disco record and it was a
massive hit,'' Rice says. ``I doubt whether many people who bought
the record understood it came from a show.''
   Another song, ``I Know Him So Well'' was a No. 1 seller in
England and the rest of Europe, but fared less well in the United
States, Rice says, because American radio stations just wouldn't
play it.
   Helping put ``Chess'' on stage has only been a small part of
Rice's current activities. He runs a cricket team, writes books on
the sport as well as on pop music, supervises a publishing company
and occasionally performs as a singer and actor.
   Rice has a book about cricket and art _ paintings about cricket
_ coming out in the fall. He's an enthusiastic booster of the game,
which mystifies most Americans.
   ``American football is instant and very easy to understand once
it's explained,'' he says. ``Cricket (one game) can take five days
and even then you may not have any results. To be honest, it's more
like chess than any other game.
   ``The great thing about cricket is the social side of it,'' he
adds. ``Long tea intervals, sandwiches and sitting on the lawn in
deck chairs.''
   Rice also has a passion for pop music, a sound he heard first as
a child in Tokyo. His father was the Far Eastern representative for
an English aircraft company and Rice would listen to American Armed
Forces Radio. It was the days of ``Rock Around the Clock,'' ``The
Ballad of Davy Crockett'' and ``Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom
White.''
   ``Almost any pop record released from 1957 to 1967 I love with
total lack of discrimination,'' he says.

   The gold-mining industry is the powerhouse of
South Africa's economy, the strongest in Africa, and the fuel is
the ore dug from thousands of feet below the surface by blacks,
supervised by whites and barred by apartheid from advancing in
their jobs, or even living where they want. An Associated Press
correspondent descended into a South African gold mine with a black
work team recently and this is what she saw.

<DATELINE>WESTERN HOLDINGS MINE, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of feet
below the cornfields of Orange Free State, men are at work 20 hours
a day in heat, dust and danger, digging out the ore that feeds
South Africa's $15-billion-a-year gold industry.
   Ninety percent of them are blacks, barred by apartheid from
advancing any farther in an industry that drives South Africa's
economy.
   In this mine, 3,600 feet below the corn, there was no breeze to
cool the sweaty brow this day. The only sound as the day shift
started its work was that of the men, carrying drills, picks and
shovels, as they trudged in heavy boots through the mud toward a
band of dark quartzite that signifies a gold-bearing reef.
   The men had stripped down to short pants to work in the
90-degree heat of the mine, hanging their outer pants, jackets and
shirts on pegs or beams along the walls of the tunnel.
   The danger was there, as it always is, when their drills started
screaming into the rock and the men hacked with picks and shoveled
the rubble aside, preparing holes for the explosives that would
blow the ore loose.
   About 800 miners a year die on the job in South Africa, from
rockbursts caused by underground pressure, tunnel collapses,
poisonous fumes, fire and other accidents.
   This part of the work _ digging out the ore _ is for the
unskilled and semi-skilled, for the blacks, who put in the the
longest hours for the lowest pay.
   They operate the drills, the ore carriers, the air hoses and
pulleys, but the highest position they can hold is that of team
leader, which pays up to 1200 rand ($600) a month for directing
operations at the rock face. That's still 200 rand ($100) less than
the lowest-paid whites in the mines.
   The blacks are prevented by law from handling explosives, a job
that would qualify them for the supervisory positions leading to
management.
   Western Holdings Mine, owned by the Anglo American Corp., has
about 18,000 employees, with 28.5 percent from nearby Lesotho, the
enclave kingdom within South Africa; 25.6 percent from Transkei, a
South African black homeland; and 29 percent, including 9 percent
whites, from South Africa's four provinces.
   As the men worked this day, sweat streamed down their faces from
under the plastic safety helmets worn by the 13 black team members
and their white supervisor. The screaming water drill sprayed tiny
granules of rock back into their faces and bare chests. The
drilling bore the holes for the placement of explosives to blast
the ore loose, then came the shrill whistle of the air hose used to
clear the holes.
   The noise was deafening.
   Anglo American company is negotiating with the National Union of
Mineworkers, which represents 60 percent of black employees in its
mines, to require miners to wear ear muffs because the noise of the
drills and blasting eventually affects hearing.
   ``There is a tradition of deafness being something to be proud
of, indicating long service, but we just can't accept that,'' said
Andrew Robb, section manager of No. 5 shaft.
   This shaft, one of six on Western Holdings Mine, produces 70,000
tons of ore a month, from which about 17,600 ounces of gold is
extracted. It is one of seven adjacent mines that together produced
about 4 million ounces of gold in 1987 for Anglo American, the
country's largest mining company.
   The average black miner, prohibited by law from advancing up the
ranks to supervisory work, earns 650 rand ($325) in cash a month _
five times less than the average white mineworker _ plus room and
board at Anglo American mines.
   The company has threatened to take South Africa's apartheid
government to court over the law, which is being rewritten. Anglo
is also quietly defying government restrictions on where its
employees can live, allowing some single black men, such as
engineers, to live in housing designated for whites.
   According to 1950s projections, Western Holdings Mine should
have been abandoned by now, but the current price of gold, hovering
around $450 an ounce, makes mining low-grade sections feasible.
   After the men at the rock face finish their day shift, a new
crew takes over to collect the gold ore and the day shift rides the
elevators back to the surface.
   The whites go home; the blacks go to hostels where they are
required by law to live.
   Anglo American is trying to combat the law, which requires black
miners to live in segregated, single-sex hostels on mine property,
while their families must remain in far-off rural tribal homelands
or even in other countries.
   The law does not apply to the foreign whites, many of them from
Scotland and Wales.
   In addition to Lesotho, black miners at Western Holdings come
from nearby Mozambique, Botswana, Swaziland and Malawi.
   Anglo American is subsidizing apartments and houses in the black
township of Thabong for many of its black employees who want to
live with their families and can afford it. Many are single, and
many others do not want to give up their rural homes, or are
foreigners whose families cannot come to South Africa.
   A few thousand probably will get to move into the homes in
Thabong when they are completed. The rest will remain in the
hostels, sending money to their families and visiting them once or
twice a year.
   At the hostel for the No. 5 shaft, 5,146 black men live in a
setting with the combined atmosphere of a prison, a college
dormitory and an English boarding school.
   Eight to 16 men sleep on bunk beds in each room.
   The men take their meals in a central kitchen for each of the 10
dormitory blocks, which are mixed tribally. The complex includes a
sports field, a technical training center and a bar.

<HEAD>French Election: `What Will Change, Whoever Wins?'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MORT ROSENBLUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LE FORNET, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the crumbling manor he shares with
his sheep, Adolphe Bonnevie frowns into his field glasses at a
France caught between star wars and Louis XIV. He is not cheered by
the presidential campaign around him.
   ``What will change, whoever wins?'' he asked, expressing a
common view of the likely re-election of Francois Mitterrand.
``What changed in the last seven years? More unemployment, the same
problems.''
   In Paris, lawyer Alain Spilliaert made a similar point:
   ``People believed in ideologies in 1981. They elected Mitterrand
as a Socialist, to bring about change. Now they see their problems
are beyond ideology. They'll vote for a person, not a party.''
   Across France, people echo Bonnevie's concerns over jobs,
technological competition, agriculture, education and urban
problems. Few are willing to express more than guarded optimism.
   Unemployment is 10.5 percent. Last year's trade deficit of $5.5
billion was 60 times higher than in 1986. Economic growth of 2
percent lags far behind Britain's.
   But more, Frenchmen see an erosion of culture and a breaking
down of the fabled art of living that once set France apart. Old
roots are dying, and new growth is too sparse.
   Around villages like Le Fornet, tucked away in a back corner of
the French Alps, the ``crisis'' takes tangible shape.
   Bonnevie, an aging farmer, owns most of the village, old stone
buildings, cobblestones and a patchwork of fields. He sits in the
sun and trains his binoculars on passersby. Most are in ski clothes.
   Le Fornet is three miles from Val d'Isere, which in preparing
for the 1992 Winter Olympics, has hurtled itself into the space age.
   A sleek train rockets skiers straight through the mountain, to
the top of La Daille. Val d'Isere's relaxed little main plaza has
vanished below a gigantic hotel-mall.
   The last remnants of the past, a stone home built in 1642, a
generation before Louis XIV, the Sun King, are hardly visible amid
a forest of garish signs.
   ``This is a ski factory,'' grumbles Jean-Francois Lamy, who sold
his Squaw Valley Hotel and is moving to Geneva. ``They have lost
all the flavor, the old way of life, and they'll never get it
back.''
   In Albertville, headquarters of 1992 Winter Olympics, old
regulars still shuffle into the Cafe des 4 Vallees and wait,
without a word, for Marcel to bring their ``petit blanc,'' their
glass of wine.
   But the cafe, redone in plastic and formica, no longer serves
France's hallowed melted ham and cheese sandwich, the croque
monsieur. Now there is a goopy microwaved substitute called
Love-Croquy, sold along with ``les Love Double Cheeseburger.''
   On Easter Sunday, the baker lady was selling brioches at Au
Peche Mignon.
   ``Mitterrand, someone else, what's the difference?'' she said,
with a merry laugh. ``I'm still working every weekend.''
   Down the mountain in Lyon, the heart of old-style France, a
conflict of ages is evident in the modern new neighborhood called
Part Dieu, which translates roughly to ``God's Little Acre.''
   Futuristic trains cut the old time in half, to two hours, from
Paris to Lyon's high-tech Part Dieu Station. But the Hertz
car-rental office closes four hours for Sunday lunch.
   The huge Mr. Chef cafeteria advertises, ``Open 11 a.m. to 9
p.m., even Sundays,'' but it closes for lunch, at 2:30 p.m.
   Campaign posters cover every flat surface of Part Dieu, but few
people questioned in the street say they think any of the
candidates can make headway against underlying problems.
   Most pictures show the jovial face of Raymond Barre, Lyon's
favorite son, who warns that any serious economic recovery will
take at least two years of job retraining.
   His rival conservative for the chance to run against Mitterrand
in the May 8 runoff is Premier Jacques Chirac, who argues roughly
the same thing with a flashier style.
   Posters also tout arch-conservative Jean-Marie Le Pen, who
argues foreign cultural pollution is taking France from the French.
As a dark horse, his ads call him: ``L'Outsider.''
   ``It makes no difference,'' said Andre Duranson, a Lyon driver
who prefers sports to politics. ``All of them want the same
thing.'' He patted his wallet pocket. ``They clean up, and then
they go.''

   A malaise was reflected in l'Express magazine. A poll indicated
54 percent of a sample of the nation's elite thought France was in
decline.
   The country is finding it costly to retain the grandeur of
Charles de Gaulle's defiant defense and foreign policies.
   France is quietly moving closer to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. Recently, 1,000 U.S. Marines from the 6th Fleet came
ashore for a two-week exercise, the first on French soil since 1966.
   Economically, France is to blend into a unified European system
by 1992.
   ``Our motherland is France, but our future is Europe,''
Mitterrand put it.
   Less easily defined signs indicate a concern that traditional
French values and tastes are at risk.
   Le Pen's main plank is to send home immigrants, fueling racism
among those who worry that 2 million people of North African
extraction will curdle the melting pot.
   Ironically, Le Pen's far-right National Front has taken votes
from the Communist Party, replacing the old left as the place for
disgruntled workers to register their protest.
   Even dyed-in-the-wool Communist supporters expect their
candidate to poll less than 7 percent, half of their 1981 showing
and less than a third of their high-water mark after World War II.
   More generally, middle class French parents worry that youths
are growing up selfish, without depth or respect for traditions.
Few see campaign programs that might counter the trend.
   For a large number, it is a cultural vacuum, especially on
television.
   The two private channels licensed last year, amid great hoopla,
show only 24.5 percent original French programing. One offering is
Sexy Clips, in which nude couples stress togetherness in ways
outlawed in some American states.
   On ``La Roue de la Fortune,'' a perky Frenchwoman turns letters
for contestants who spin a giant wheel to decipher a blanked out
message. In French, the show's name means, ``The Wheel of Fortune.''
   There is also, ``Le Juste Prix'' _ ``The Price is Right.'' Both
French productions are licensed by the shows they copy.
   At 8 a.m., viewers choose among Daffy Duck, Andy Panda and Dan
Rather. The pay channel, Canal Plus, retransmits the CBS Evening
News in English at that time, and it is fast gaining popularity.
   Some Frenchmen worry that much of France is falling into foreign
hands.
   Foreigners bought up $1 billion worth of French real estate last
year, a fifth of the market.
   Japanese investors built an office complex at Montparnasse where
once Ernest Hemingway could barely afford a cup of coffee.
   Most important, people are caught in the middle as the country
meshes with the modern world, but old ways foul the gears.
   Mitterrand has made it clear that in a second term, he would set
aside Socialist dogma in favor of letting France find its own pace.
   He told an interviewer: ``The country is headed toward a
free-market economy, and so let's play it to the hilt. Let us have
no half measures.''
   But now there is ``OPA,'' an acronym, meaning corporate
takeover, that is a new French fad word.
   When Schneider S.A., a diversified holding company, tried to
take over the industrial automation group Telemecanique Electrique,
however, workers blocked it by marching in the streets _ the way
Frenchmen have done since the Revolution that broke the Sun King's
line.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Beetlejuice''; ``The Seventh Sign''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Beetlejuice''
   
   Sometimes a devilishly dynamic performance lifts a movie out of
the ordinary. That happened last year with Jack Nicholson's satanic
furioso in ``The Witches of Eastwick.'' Now comes Michael Keaton in
the title role of ``Beetlejuice.''
   Keaton outroars a banshee. His head rotates with a velocity of
which Linda Blair never dreamed. He is so unspeakably, devotedly
evil that he becomes almost lovable. It's a great comic performance
that redeems the obvious crowd-grabbing strategy behind
``Beetlejuice.''
   Curiously, the movie begins much the same as ``The Witches of
Eastwick.'' The camera hovers over a picture-postcard New England
village and travels through the immaculate streets and freshly
painted buildings to focus on a hilltop house that looks a bit huge
for its surroundings.
   The occupants are a pair of cheerful yuppies, Alec Baldwin and
Geena Davis, whose main occupation appears to be puttering around
the mammoth house. Their work is interrupted when they drive into
town for supplies. On the return they swerve on a covered bridge,
land in the river and drown.
   Rather confusedly, they return to the house as ghosts slightly
less sophisticated than Cary Grant and Constance Bennett in
``Topper.'' Their lives continue much the the same, though
invisibly, until the house is sold to a New York developer, Jeffrey
Jones. He moves in with his death-obsessed daughter, Winona Ryder,
and his second wife, Catherine O'Hara, who is hellbent to transform
the house into a chic monstrosity.
   Alarmed by what is happening to their house, the yuppies seek
help from the after-life bureaucracy, a useless exercise. Finally,
they enlist the infamous Keaton who rises from his grave to
perpetrate his monstrous deeds.
   Director Tim Burton (``Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'') is a former
Disney animator, and his film has the kinetic energy of a cartoon.
There is also a synthetic plot, credited to Michael McDowell and
Warren Skaaren, which affords little of the logic needed for a
convincing fantasy.
   Unrecognizable in his weirdo makeup, Keaton behaves
outrageously; it's a marvelous characterization. Also helpful are
Jeffrey Jones (``Ferris Beuller's Day Off''), Catherine O'Hara
(``SCTV'') and Winona Ryder as the invaders.
   ``Beetlejuice'' was produced by Michael Bender, Larry Wilson and
Richard Hashimoto. The Warner Bros. release is rated PG, mostly for
its scare quotient. Running time: 92 minutes.

   ``The Seventh Sign''
   
   An intense man walks purposely through the sands of a beach in
Haiti. He stares ponderously at the sea, breaks a small, round
token and tosses it and a piece of parchment into the water. Almost
immediately, sea life washes up _ dead.
   This purportedly foretells the coming of the apocalypse _ the
ultimate destruction of evil and triumph of good. It is the first
of seven signs, and in the Carl Schultz movie, ``The Seventh
Sign,'' only one woman can stop it.
   The woman is Demi Moore.
   Demi Moore? Demi Moore of the Brat Pack? Demi Moore who is also
Mrs. Bruce (``Moonlighting'') Willis? Demi Moore who is about as
compelling on screen as Gumby? What in the name of Boris Karloff is
she doing in a ``serious'' occult thriller?
   However, Moore's tepid performance in the Tri-Star Pictures
release is only one problem with this meandering and misguided
movie.
   One by one, the signs happen: A village is frozen in the middle
of the Negev desert; a river runs with blood; hail the size of a
baseball falls in Southern California; there's an unexpected
eclipse in which the moon becomes red. Interestingly enough, no one
in the news media, science or government takes any notice.
   The stranger (Jurgen Prochnow) rents a room from Russell and
Abby Quinn, who are played by Michael Biehn, who limps through his
role, and Moore.
   Abby, who is seven months pregnant, discovers more tokens and
parchments in his room and takes one of the pages to a rabbi for
translation. But she offends him and instead gets assistance from
the scholar's brash young neighbor, Avi (Manny Jacobs), who not
only tells her that she's up to her agnostic chin in the apocalypse
but also becomes her sidekick.
   Meanwhile, hot on the heels of the Quinn's boarder is a priest
named Lucci (Peter Friedman) who is investigating the strange signs
for the Vatican. Is he good or evil? If you can sit through another
20 minutes of the movie, you'll find out.
   While Abby tries to figure out how to stop the apocalypse, her
lawyer husband tries to save his client, Jimmy, from the gas
chamber.
   John Taylor, a 20-year-old who has Down's Syndrome, gives an
excellent and sensitive performance as the tormented Jimmy, who
killed his mother and father in God's name because they were
brother and sister _ incest was against the way of God.
   Abby has constant flashbacks to another time in history: little
flickers of a centurion; a tortured man of goodness; a woman
holding a water vessel. It's easy to figure out who is who and what
is what, especially since the movie was released during the
Easter-Passover season.
   What's not easy to figure out is why the filmmakers didn't pay
more attention to organization and sense in their production, and
plug in the many holes that make ``The Seventh Sign'' the eighth
wonder of muddled movies.
   The Interscope Communications Production, with a script by W.W.
Wicket and George Kaplan, is saved only by the lovely and dramatic
photography of Juan Ruiz Anchia and Stephen Marsh's sets. The movie
is rated R for strong adult themes and some nudity.

   ``Fatal Attraction,'' that slice and dice lust
thriller starring Glenn Close and Michael Douglas, is finally being
released as a video from Paramount Home Video.
   The Academy Award-nominated movie _ for best picture, director,
actress and screenplay adapation _ was the film industry's biggest
moneymaker last year, selling $150 million worth of tickets in the
United States and Canada. With its themes of adultery, terror and
mental instability, it still draws lines at some movie theaters.
   If you missed this one on the big screen, you can buy it for the
small screen beginning June 1 (VHS@Beta, $89.95, Rated R).
   Paramount also is releasing a dubbed, English-language version
of the Oscar-nominated ``My Life as a Dog'' on April 20. The
subtitled original of the Swedish language movie by Lasse
Hallstrom, concerning a Swedish boy learning about life and death
in the 1950s, will be released on May 18 (VHS@Beta, $79.95).
   Out this week from MCA Video is one of the best contemporary
rock films ever made, ``Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll''
(VHS, $79.95, Rated PG). When the tribute to the legendary Chuck
Berry premiered at last year's New York Film Festival, critics and
audiences cheered.
   Also on the market this month: ``Date With an Angel'' (HBO
Video, VHS, $89.99, Rated PG); ``Deadly Illusion'' (RCA-Columbia
Pictures Home Video, VHS@Beta, $79.95, Rated R); ``Flowers in the
Attic'' (New World Video, VHS, $89.95, Rated PG-13); and
``Dancers'' (Warner Home Video, $89.95, Rated PG).
   Videos reviewed this week:
   
   ``Dancers''
   
   When this Herbert Ross movie starring Mikhail Baryshnikov first
came out in October 1987, it pirouetted right off the screen after
a thrashing by critics.
   ``Dancers'' is not the greatest ballet movie ever made _ it will
never fill those red shoes. It was directed by Herbert Ross, who
also did ``The Turning Point,'' but falls short of his earlier
effort.
   Still, the movie seems to find a comfortable niche on the home
screen: Somehow, it's more believable and engaging.
   The plot revolves around Anton Sergeyev (Baryshnikov), the
world's star male dancer. He's also a ladykiller who's in Italy to
film a production of ``Giselle.'' There are sexual innuendoes and
flirtations and some excellent performances by the American Ballet
Theater.
   Leslie Browne, who starred with Baryshnikov in ``The Turning
Point, appears as Anton's ex-lover. The ABT's Alessandra Ferri also
co-stars.

   ``Deadly Illusion''
   
   Get a giant cauldron, drop in Billy Dee Williams, Vanity and
Morgan Fairchild and what do you get? A soupy, unappetizing mess
called ``Deadly Illusion.''
   Williams plays a private detective with the improbable name of
Hamberger. His repeating line throughout the movie is, ``Please, no
jokes about the name.'' Vanity, whose leather and lingerie cover
her lousy acting, plays his girlfriend and assistant. Fairchild,
who has a brief, lusty romp with Williams, is the villain who sets
up Hamberger for murder.
   Hamberger, ever so friendly with the local police, is given 48
hours to prove his innocence (sound familiar?) and find the real
killer.
   Forget the action, forget the thrills: There aren't any. Nor is
there any slick dialogue in this movie written by Larry Cohen, who
co-directed with William Tannen.
   With two directors you'd think they'd be able to keep their
geography straight. Not these guys. They have Williams racing
through Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan. He looks over his
shoulder, turns a corner and in a blink is downtown in the Wall
Street area in the same chase scene. Not even the best marathon
runner could accomplish that.

   ``Birth, School, Work, Death'' (Epic) _ The Godfathers
   
   For a while there, it seemed like bands from England had
forgotten how to rock and roll.
   Thatcher's island lately has produced an overabundance of
frothing pop and synthesizer-drenched angst. Now along come the
Godfathers, with a sound as vaguely sinister as their name.
   The Godfathers combine classic 1960s rock song structures with
the aggressive cynicism of punk. Frankly, they'd be lost in the
crowd if placed in either of those two eras, but the current lack
of energy makes the Godfathers stand out.
   The title track of ``Birth, School, Work, Death,'' performed
with a sneer by Peter Coyne, puts the ``life stinks, then you die''
bumper-sticker philosophy to music. In the process, it sums up the
working-class frustrations that course through the Godfathers'
music.
   Unfortunately, cliches litter their writing, and nowhere is it
more evident than here. Far better is ``If I Only Had Time,'' with
a melody that leaves a more lasting impression than the chanted
chorus of the title cut. ``If I only had time,'' Coyne sings, ``I'd
think of the perfect crime.''
   Guitarists Mike Gibson and Kris Dollimore shine with a sloppy
exuberance, leading one to believe their own personal godfather is
Keith Richards. They're at their best in the rockabilly ``S.T.B.,''
and the droning lead guitar salvages the silly psychedelia of
``When Am I Coming Down?''
   In sound and stance, the Godfathers could be British cousins to
the Georgia Satellites, minus the sense of humor. Their youthful
energy wins them more respect than their songs at this point, but
the Godfathers are worth keeping an eye on.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Celebrity Finds Judge Reinhold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judge Reinhold has his own gauge on how fast
celebrity can overtake an actor in today's Hollywood.
   ``The week before `Beverly Hills Cop' opened, I was asked to
show two pieces of ID to cash a check at my bank, where I had an
account for two years,'' he related. ``The week after the film
opened, I had a family in a station wagon scream at me on the
freeway to pull over for an autograph.''
   Reinhold has been on a roll ever since, adding to his credits
``Off Beat,'' ``Ruthless People,'' ``Beverly Hills Cop II.'' His
current release is ``Vice Versa,'' in which he changes identities
with his 11-year-old son, played by Fred Savage.
   Yes, he realizes that the plot parallels those of ``Like Father,
Like Son,'' but he claims priority.
   ``Our story was taken from a children's book written in England
in 1880. A very popular, enduring book that's still popular. It
concerned a duke who switched consciousness with his son. There was
a movie, `Vice Versa,' made with Peter Ustinov in the early 1950s.''
   Reinhold admitted he was at first reluctant to undertake ``Vice
Versa'' because of the similarity to ``Like Father, Like Son.'' But
as soon as he was committed, he jumped into his research.
   ``I hung out in video arcades and gymnasiums,'' he recalled. ``I
was once asked to leave a playground by the police because I was
just standing around watching the kids. I didn't have the nerve to
say, `Do you know who I am?' So I just left quietly.''
   In the early stages of ``Vice Versa,'' the actor was concerned
about the casting of his son: ``I knew the kid would make or break
the film. We saw a lot of kid actors who had a lot of kid-actor
tricks they knew adults would respond to. Fred had none of that. He
came in like a little Jimmy Cagney and just took the part.
   ``As soon as Fred was cast, I knew we had something special,''
he said. ``He's got this comedy timing that must be God-given; I
don't know where else he could get it. We became real pals. I had
him record all my lines, and I recorded all his lines, so we'd go
home and study each other's inflections and nuances.''
   Reinhold showed the completed film to his mother and asked if he
had been anything like the kid in the movie. Her reply: ``Oh, no,
you were much more obnoxious.''
   He was born Edward Ernest Reinhold Jr. in Wilmington, Del., but
at the age of 2 he looked so much like a judge that the name stuck.
He grew up in comfortable surroundings. His father was a trial
lawyer and the actor remembers him as an aloof man whose command of
a courtroom probably fostered his son's acting ambitions.
   ``I was pretty comically oriented as a kid,'' he said. ``That
was how I got attention.''
   After drama classes in four Eastern universities, Reinhold spent
a year playing a variety of roles in stock and dinner theaters.
When his father died in 1977 he moved to California. He worked in a
frozen yogurt store by day to finance his night acting classes at
the James Best Workshop. His arrival in Hollywood was perfectly
timed.
   ``I hit town in 1977, and in 1978, `Animal House' came out and
opened up a whole new genre of youth-oriented films,'' he recalled.
``I was plucked up pretty fast.''
   Reinhold appeared in such films as ``Stripes,'' ``Fast Times at
Ridgemont High,'' ``The Lords of Discipline'' and ``Gremlins.''
   As the rookie detective in the megahit ``Beverly Hills Cop,''
Reinhold hit the big time. He followed with ``Head Office,''
``Ruthless People'' and ``Beverly Hills Cop II.'' But Reinhold now
figures playing the goofy guy can be too much of a good thing.
   ``I'm at an important point where if I continue along these
lines, people aren't going to accept me any other way,'' he said.
``I really do want to have a well-rounded and enduring career, do
all kinds of different things. Much as I love comedy, I will have
to hold back right now.
   ``I did my first dramatic TV movie with Rosanna Arquette,
`Promised a Miracle.' It's about two fundamentalist Christians who
take their diabetic son off insulin and he dies three days later of
insulin shock. It's a true story, very powerful stuff. I want to do
more dramatic work.''
   Despite his newfound fame, Reinhold feels a trifle uneasy:
``Sometimes I feel I'm pushed into a place where I'm supposed to be
more special than somebody else. I don't feel real comfortable with
the idea that because I'm somewhat famous, I'm more special. That
means I'm working.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Tate Gallery Purchases Explosive Jackson Pollocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jackson Pollock was the American artist who
abandoned brushes and dripped and splashed paint straight from the
can onto canvases laid out on the floor and walls.
   His work was controversial in his lifetime and it has been
argued about ever since he died in a car crash in 1956.
   London's Tate Gallery has no doubt of his importance, and the
state museum of British and 20th-century art has just doubled its
holdings of Pollock works to six from three. It says that's more
than any other museum outside New York.
   Jeremy Lewison, the Tate curator responsible for American art,
said no other state museum in Britain has even one Pollock.
   ``The Tate now has Europe's finest collection of American
abstract expressionism,'' he said.
   That is the term for the painting style of Pollock and his
fellow artists _ Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Franz Kline and
Pollock's wife, Lee Krasner. An alternative term was ``action
painting,'' the invention of critic Harold Rosenberg.
   ``Pollock liberated the application of paint,'' Lewison said.
   Sir Alan Bowness, the Tate's director, is a Pollock enthusiast
and dismisses with a smile claims that Pollock and the other
members of the New York School of the 1940s and '50s were not true
artists.
   ``I am quite sure that Pollock's place in the history of art is
secure,'' he said in an interview. ``The three paintings we have
acquired are classic masterpieces and not simply innovative new art.
   ``Pollock was the first great American painter and one of the
major artists, if not the major one, of the mid-20th century. He
had a sense of his importance because he was the first to make
paintings like that. His work has elements of the work of Picasso
and Miro, but he did something completely new.''
   The three Pollocks, ``Birth,'' ``Summertime'' and ``Number 14,''
were painted between 1941-51. They had been on loan to the museum
since 1982.
   The director wouldn't say how much they cost, but said it was
``rather more than we would receive from the government in any one
year.'' The Tate's 1988 grant from the government for the purchase
of pictures is $3.375 million.
   The record price for a Pollock painting was the $2.5 million
paid at Sotheby's in New York last May for ``Number 26,'' painted
in 1950.
   Bowness recalled that when he was appointed director in 1980,
the Tate had three Pollocks and one of his priorities was to obtain
more.
   ``I went to New York at the end of 1980 to talk to Lee Krasner,
a very remarkable lady and an undervalued artist in her own
right,'' he said.
   ``She wanted to see her husband's work properly shown
internationally and loaned us these three works which her husband
had retained during his lifetime.''
   Shortly before she died in 1984, Krasner agreed to sell them to
the Tate over a four-year period because the museum couldn't afford
them all at once.
   The purchase has been made from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation
Inc., which is funded with the bulk of Krasner's estate, and has
granted more than $1.5 million to some 300 ``worthy artists who are
in need.''
   Bowness praised the foundation, saying he thought it a fine
thing that money from the sale of art should be ``recycled'' to
help artists.
   The most striking of the three works is ``Summertime,'' just
under 3 feet high and nearly 18 feet long, like a frieze. Pollock
laid out the canvas on the floor in 1948 and poured and dripped
paint and enamel over it in swirls and patches.
   The painting, first seen at the Betty Parsons' Gallery in New
York in 1949, expresses a sense of exhilaration and joy.
   Pollock wrote at the time, when he was living near the Atlantic
Ocean: ``My concern is with the rhythms of nature ... the way the
ocean moves. ... I work from the inside out like nature.''
   Pollock liked to paint on a big scale. Born in 1912 in Cody,
Wyo., his canvases took on the characteristic of what he called the
``vast horizontality of the land'' in the American West.
   His nephew, Jason McCoy, is a New York art dealer whose father,
Sanford, was an artist. Another uncle, Charles, was also a painter.
McCoy attended a recent reception at the Tate to announce the
Pollock purchases.
   ``Painting was always treated seriously in my family,'' recalled
McCoy, who grew up in Deep River, Conn.
   ``It had true meaning then _ something I think impossible to
conceive of now in the late 1980s. It wasn't about the monetary end
of it, but the genuine concern with the action of painting.''
   McCoy was 8 years old when his uncle died so he doesn't remember
too much about Pollock as an artist, although he does recall his
uncle giving him his first bicycle.
   Pollock lived on Long Island at that time, and while the boy
visited his house, ``his studio was not a place one toured
lightly,'' McCoy said.
   ``But young as I was, my childhood was infused with the belief
that Jackson Pollock was an important painter.''
   He said with a rueful grin: ``My father eventually stopped
painting to make a living. He went into printed circuits for
rockets.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Opinionated Rockers From Down Under</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since releasing its first album in 1978, the
Australian rock group Midnight Oil has taken on a wide range of
issues: the environment, human rights, the arms race, unemployment.
   ``Diesel and Dust,'' their latest LP, is no exception. Songs
such as ``Beds Are Burning'' and ``Dreamworld'' warn about coming
to terms with a changing world. ``The Dead Heart'' attacks
exploitation of aborigines in Australia. ``Warakurna'' is a demand
for a better life.
   The group's lead singer, Peter Garrett, is not the type of
person who keeps his opinions to himself.
   ``I am prepared to debate anybody,'' said Garrett, who is
recuperating from a leg injury suffered during a recent show. ``I
grew up in a household where politics was not a dirty word.
   ``I have a great interest in what's going on. I have opinions
but I also want to be able to back it up.''
   Garrett's interest in the affairs of his country go beyond
making records. He has written newspaper columns on current issues,
taken an active role in trying to rewrite the Australian
Constitution and, most prominently, ran for the Senate in 1984 as a
candidate for the Nuclear Disarmament Party.
   ``The major politicians tried to make fun of the issue. They
said it was simplistic, emotional, single-issue, naive politics,''
said Garrett, who was narrowly defeated. ``They alienated everybody
who liked rock music. It changed people's attitudes.
   ``I was surprised that the leading politicians were lying. We
were trying to tell the truth.''
   Midnight Oil was formed in the 1970s and released its first
album, ``Midnight Oil,'' in 1978. While they have yet to achieve
major popularity in the United States, their records have
consistently sold well in Australia. In 1982, the LP
``10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1'' reached No. 1 and went triple platinum.
``Red Sails in the Sunset,'' released in 1984, also topped the
Australian charts.
   Midnight Oil contributed royalties from 1985's ``Species
Diseases'' to a trust fund for peace and disarmament. They have
performed at countless benefit concerts.
   ``We're making our people understand we've got a part in their
lives,'' Garrett said. ``We care about the price of the T-shirts.
We're not pop stars on a guided tour. The band's not that kind of
band.''
   Besides Garrett, the band features drummer Rob Hirdt, guitarist
Martin Rotsey, guitarist and keyboardist Jim Moginie and bassist
Peter Gifford. All the songs on ``Diesel and Dust'' are credited to
Midnight Oil. And all the songs are about Australia.
   ``We find so much going on in Australia,'' Garrett said. ``We're
never without something to write about.''
   Midnight Oil has spent considerable time helping aborigines, an
ancient tribe whose plight has been similar to American Indians.
They have toured aboriginal communities and on ``Diesel and Dust''
included the song ``Bullroarer,'' which refers to an aboriginal
musical instrument.
   ``The bullroarer is used to provide warnings when sacred
ceremonies are being undertaken by aboriginal people,'' Garrett
said. ``Having gone into the desert and spent time with them has
given us a shot in the arm about trying to write about these
things.''
   Because Australia is still a member of the United Kingdom and
has extensive relations with the United States, Garrett is
especially conscious of the impact those countries have on his
native land.
   On ``The Dead Heart,'' Garrett sings of Britain: ``We don't
serve your country, don't serve your king.''
   ``The Queen is still head of Australia,'' said Garrett. ``Our
constitution is in England.''
   Garrett also has been critical of the United States, especially
of its policy of bringing nuclear armed warships to Australia. He
acknowledges, however, the enormous influence the United States has
had on his country.
   ``You're very conscious of the headmaster, the bully. That whole
thing of size and power and strength and vitality. Awesomeness that
can't be escaped,'' Garrett said. ``You're eating it; you're
consuming it as entertainment. It affects your standard of living.
It's always there. It's like the sun.''
   Garrett also believes that being an Australian as opposed to an
American band has helped Midnight Oil stay in touch with its fans.
   ``In America, it's quite natural to have stars,'' he said. ``In
Australia, we tend to view each other as just people.''
   Garrett insists, however, that he is not anti-American. ``I've
said some terrible things about America but there are parts of it
which I think are terrific.''
   Although Garrett spends a great deal of time focusing on the
problems of his country and the world, he is far from pessimistic
about the future.
   The last song on ``Diesel and Dust'' is called ``Sometimes.''
The last words of ``Sometimes'' are: ``You don't give in.''
   ``This is not end of the world music,'' Garrett said. ``There's
always hope _ that's what it's all about.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s Salad Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early in 1937, a brash, dashing actor named
Douglas Fairbanks Jr. had a call from one of Hollywood's biggest
and most important filmmakers, David O. Selznick. He wanted
Fairbanks to play the bad guy in a remake of ``The Prisoner of
Zenda.''
   Fairbanks, although happy to have an offer, was upset. ``I was
set back on my heels at being asked to be a supporting or featured
player to anyone _ even so fine an actor as Ronald Coleman,'' he
recalls in volume one of his new autobiography, ``The Salad Days''
(Doubleday, $19.95).
   What to do? Only one person to turn to, the one person he never
wanted to use to further his career: His father, the great silent
film star whose romance with Mary Pickford made them a celebration
of the movie world.
   So fierce was young Fairbanks in wanting to make it on his own,
he even considered changing his name. ``But the minute word got
out, I knew there would be too much publicity so I didn't,'' he
said in an interview.
   ``Those feelings toward my father are hard to recapture. I
suppose partly I didn't want to emulate him. The theatrical hero of
my youth was John Barrymore.''
   He had long sought his father's approval, he said, and finally
got it with ``Zenda.''
   Fairbanks Sr. told his son to take the part: ``Because not only
is `The Prisoner of Zenda' one of the best romances written in a
hundred years ... but Rupert of Hentzau (the role Fairbanks would
play) is probably one of the best villains ever written. He is
witty, irresistible and sly as Iago.''
   Young Fairbanks, of course, went on to star in the movie,
creating one of the most sophisticated villains the screen world
has ever seen. It remains his favorite role.
   The ``Zenda'' tale is but one tasty morsel in the autobiography,
a veritable salad bar of celebrity browsing: He was married at the
age of 19 to Joan Crawford; the marriage lasted a blink. He had an
affair with Marlene Dietrich and was once greeted by a bobby as he
left her hotel room by a fire escape early one morning.
   The book is punctuated with the famous of the day: Noel Coward,
David Niven, Irene Dunne, Laurence Olivier.
   However, Fairbanks is too much the gentleman and bon vivant to
assault his readers with a lusty ``kiss-and-tell'' book.
   ``I tried not to be sensational; I just tried to tell it
straight,'' he said.``Kiss-and-tell books are the easiest things to
do.''
   Instead, Fairbanks leads a friendly tour of his family, his
youth, his movies and finally his diplomatic work for President
Roosevelt during World War II. Volume one ends in 1941, and he's
already started the concluding volume. It was Doubleday's idea to
do two books.
   ``Noel Coward took three volumes to tell his story,'' Fairbanks
said with a wink.
   Fairbanks started writing the book three years ago, in longhand,
but his experience dates back to his teen years when he started
writing for Vanity Fair. Why did he begin an autobiography at this
time in his life?
   ``A publisher came along with a good offer. It's as vulgar as
that,'' he said with that string-of-pearls smile that once caused
grown women to blush.
   ``I think if I had my druthers, I'd prefer to be a writer more
than anything else,'' he said. ``I think I'd like to be a painter
next and an actor last. But I would rather write about something
else than about myself.''
   The hardest problem in writing the autobiography, he said, was
``trying not to sound pompous or sounding like Gary Cooper _ you
know digging my heels in the ground and saying, `ah shucks,' and
being overly modest.''
   Fairbanks has appeared in 75 films and has produced others,
including ``The Exile'' in 1948. He also collaborated on the
writing for the movie, a talky swashbuckling period piece set in
the days of Charles II.
   His last movie was John Irvin's ``Ghost Story'' in 1981,
co-starring with Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas and John Houseman.
   ``Ah yes, `Ghost Story,''' he said quietly with a reflective
smile. ``It was very sad. Melvyn Douglas' character dies in the
movie and during shooting he quipped, `I'm learning how to do it.'
He died a few months later.''
   If Fairbanks could turn back the clock and do it all over again,
he said he'd like to have performed more classics.
   ``Everyone's done `Hamlet' or they think they want to,'' he
laughed. ``I would like to do `Faust,' by Goethe. But I'd rather
have written `Faust.' ...
   ``I like production _ it's part of creating. But to interpret
one's own creation must be fun.''
   However, his regrets in life are not profound ones, he said.
``My biggest regret is not having writtten a play.
   ``I believe very strongly that you should follow your star. It
doesn't matter if you succeed as long as you make the effort.''
   Fairbanks, who lives in New York, still cuts a fine figure of
elegance with his silvery hair and classic features. But the
pencil-line mustache is gone.
   ``Don't worry, I'll grow it back,'' he laughed. ``I just took it
off to do something different and to see if anyone would notice. No
one did.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Tiny Tim's Falsetto Has a Twang</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tiny Tim's stringy, long black hair is
now tinted with crimson. He still throws kisses in rapid-fire
fashion and plays a pearl-inlaid ukelele.
   But his piercing falsetto now has a touch of twang, and he
proudly wears silver cowboy boots and a huge silver belt buckle
with a gold ``T'' in the center.
   The outlandish singer who shot to stardom 20 years ago with
``Tiptoe Through the Tulips,'' is trying for a comeback as a
country music singer.
   He's released a country record titled ``Leave Me Satisfied'' for
the small NLT Records label of nearby Burns, Tenn. The song is
about a plea from one lover to another as a breakup unfolds.
   Despite his turn to country music, the 55-year-old performer
says, ``I haven't forgotten my high falsetto.''
   It's his second foray into country music since his heyday when
he married ``Miss Vicki'' (Victoria Budinger of Haddonfield, N.J.)
in 1969 on ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.''
   Ten years ago he recorded a since-forgotten song called
``Country Queen'' about a cowboy who didn't get noticed as a singer
so he decided to dress like Dolly Parton by donning a huge wig.
   More recently, Tiny Tim has been the headliner for two years
with Allan C. Hill's Great American Circus which played
one-nighters in dozens of dusty small towns from March to November.
He was billed as ``America's Very Own Eternal Troubadour.''
   He says about his legacy: ``I'm the first long-haired,
white-faced singer _ before KISS, before the Beatles. And I'm the
first `has-been' star to sing with the Great American Circus.''
   Tiny Tim, whose real name is Herbert Khaury, was wearing white
pancake makeup and sporting long locks 30 years ago, and he remains
the focus of attention wherever he is.
   He said his unusual appearance and mannerisms during his TV
performances years ago set him apart from other entertainers: ``The
mail came in like mad. People were asking, `Where'd you get him?
What a shock! Ma, you gotta see this creep!'
   ``The people want something new all the time. (Boy-next-door)
Pat Boone couldn't even get arrested, and I came along.''
   In addition to his current country music career, Tiny Tim stars
in a dcumentary movie, ``Street of Dreams,'' which is to premiere
in Brighton, England, in late May. In it he sings 139 songs for
more than two hours.
   A few years ago, he acted in the movie ``Blood Harvest,''
portraying an insane clown. The movie had distribution problems in
this country but should be released soon in Japan, he said.
   He and Miss Vicki were divorced in 1977. She has remarried twice
since then; he married Jan Alweiss, a New York City graphics
artist, in 1984.
   Millions of TV viewers watched Tiny Tim and Miss Vicki get
married on Carson's show, where their vows included a pledge never
to get ``puffed up.''
   In an interview, he said he believes Carson suggested the
wedding take place on the show in order to raise ratings in the
face of a challenge by another late night show hosted by Merv
Griffin.
   ``He's a competitor,'' Tiny Tim said. ``He saw this as a shot in
the arm. He succeeded.''
   NBC-TV, he said, bought $10,000 worth of tulips and paid for
Miss Vicki's gown.
   ``I'd have never married her but I didn't want to break her
heart,'' he said. ``I really did love her, but I could see some
problems.''
   They had a daughter, Tulip, who will turn 17 in May. She lives
in New Jersey and is studying computer science, he said. Miss
Vicki, he said, is living near Cherry Hill, N.J.
   ``I'm not in touch with her.''
   He estimated that he was a guest on Carson's show 10 to 12
times, the last one in 1979. That time, he sang a song about the
gas crisis, ``Tiptoe to the Gas Pumps,'' and did his version of Rod
Stewart's ``Do Ya Think I'm Sexy,'' in which he rolled on the floor
in a burst of showmanship.
   But the song he's most associated with is his 1968 recording of
``Tiptoe Through the Tulips.''
   ``It flowed well with the high voice,'' he said. ``It was sung
in a different sound. People said, `Hey, what's that?' It had a
great melodic theme. Melody is 99 percent of every song.
   ``But no radio station wanted to play it at first,'' he
recalled. ``A DJ in Birmingham, Ala., went on strike over the song.
It was going against the odds, but good ol' New York City didn't
let me down. They began playing it there, and then it hit in
California. By June 1968, it was the big hit of the year.''
   How does he want to be remembered?
   ``He played his part well,'' he said.

would help reach a larger number of consumers and use promotion
funds contributed by pork producers more efficiently.

<HEAD>Anti-Smoking Group To Ask Airline Stockholders For Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARREN MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national anti-smoking group says it plans
to ask shareholders of major airlines to do what it says the
federal government has not done: enact a total ban on smoking
during all domestic flights.
   Ahron Leichtman, president of Citizens Against Tobacco Smoke,
said in a weekend interview the group will attempt to arrange
shareholder votes at major U.S. airlines over the issue.
   Leichtman said the new federal law that will ban smoking on
domestic airline flights of two hours or less beginning April 23 is
a good first step but contains loopholes.
   Because Congress used a time limit rather than mileage, airline
flights scheduled for just under two hours could escape compliance,
he said. Flight time can be altered by the rate of climb, flight
altitude, the type of aircraft being used, headwinds and the
schedule of the airports involved, Leichtman said.
   The federal ban on smoking during short-term flights will expire
in two years if Congress takes no further action, but Leichtman
doesn't expect that to happen. Nevertheless, his Cincinnati-based
group does not want to wait for two years to get further action.
   Leichmtan said the group planned to take the issue to the annual
stockholders' meetings of every major airline. In addition to
seeking a total smoking ban, the group wants airline executives to
designate 50 percent of all flights over two hours as smoke free.
   The group chose Minneapolis to announce its new strategy because
Northwest Airlines, based in the suburb of Eden Prairie, already
has banned smoking on nearly all of its domestic flights, Leichtman
said.
   He said the group planned to go to Miami, Dallas, Chicago,
Atlanta and tentatively Kansas City, where other major carriers are
based to raise questions about the health, safety, economic and
legal issues raised by passenger smoking on aircraft, he said.
   ``We are going to attempt to prove to the National
Transportation Safety Board that increased carbon monoxide levels
caused by smoking in airplanes puts a flight attendant at risk by
reducing the ability to think clearly,'' Leichtman said.
   He suggested that smokers be provided with nicotine gum or
nicotine pills if they could not otherwise physically handle
smoke-free flights.

<HEAD>Dollar Advances In Europe, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in early European trading today as
investors positioned themselves for this week's meeting of finance
ministers from the major industrialized nations and the latest set
of U.S. trade figures.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers said they were expecting ministers from the seven major
industrialized nations to reaffirm their strong opposition to a
further decline of the dollar at their meeting in Washington
Wednesday.
   The meeting, in conjunction with the semi-annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, wasn't likely to
generate any market-moving news, dealers said, but a reaffirmation
of a stable-dollar policy may still help the dollar.
   The market is also in a bullish mood because traders are
speculating on a narrower U.S. trade deficit for February _ between
$11 billion and $12 billion _ when figures are released on
Thursday, dealers said. January's deficit was $12.44 billion.
   ``In the long run, the dollar is heading upward, and this is
already influencing its medium-term trend,'' said Michael Schnirel,
foreign exchange dealer at Irving Trust Company in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.53 yen to a closing 125.71 yen. Later, in
London, it rose to 126.42 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.6790 West German marks, up from 1.6725; 1.3916
Swiss francs, up from 1.3825; 5.7050 French francs, up from 5.6715;
1.88465 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8790; 1,246.80 Italian lire, up
from 1,241.75; and 1.2420 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2478
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.87 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8755 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $450.40 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $450.15, both down from late Friday's bid of
$451.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $449.80, up from $449.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 84 cents to close at a bid
$451.95. Silver was quoted in London this morning at a bid price of
$6.43 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $6.48.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Tokyo Stocks Hit New Closing High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo stock market indicator surged to a new
closing high today, while the U.S. dollar gained ground in trading
against the Japanese yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed a modest 20.33 points last Friday, gained 175.98
points, or 0.65 percent, finishing the first day of the week at
26,924.87.
   The Nikkei's close today surpassed the previous high set last
Thursday when it closed at 26,768.22. Monday's close was 278.44
points above its pre-crash best level of 26,646,43, set the week
before the worldwide stock market crash last October.
   ``Boosted by the last week's advance on Wall Street, the Nikkei
average went up to less than two points short of touching the
27,000-point level,'' said Fumihiko Morimoto of First Boston.
   The index reached 26,998.36 points, the highest ever, at one
time during the morning trade. Investors spread their buying
through most sectors amid bullish sentiment, traders said. The
dollar's stability dispelled whatever doubts investors may have had
about Tokyo stocks, they said.
   In the afternoon, however, Morimoto said concerns that the
market was rising too high prompted profit-taking, and the selling
eased prices a little.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners 531 to 351, while 173 issues
were unchanged.
   Popular issues were electricals and precision machineries.
Constructions and housing stocks also rose. Insurances and
securities were firm. Volume of the first section trade was an
estimated 900 million shares, down from 1.5 billion shares last
Friday.
   In the foreign exchange trading, the dollar closed at 125.71
yen, up 0.53 yen from its close of 125.18 yen last week. It had
opened the day at 125.80 and traded between 125.68-125.83 yen.
   ``Trading was quiet and the dollar moved very little,'' said Ken
Iiya of the Bank of Tokyo.
   He said most participants watched from the sidelines, waiting
for results of the scheduled meeting in Washington this week of
monetary authorities from the seven major industrialized nations
and the announcement of U.S. trade figures for February.

<TEXT>
   The Senate this week takes up a $1.1 trillion
budget plan accompanied by far less acrimony than usual because it
complies with last fall's deficit-reduction agreement with
President Reagan.
   The fiscal 1989 budget proposal drafted by Senate Budget
Committee chairman Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., and Sen. Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, the senior Republican on the committee, has received
bipartisan support in committee.
   The election-year budget doesn't propose new tax increases,
beyond the $14 billion already enacted for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. It also avoids eliminating any spending.
   The plan was crafted to stay within the overall spending limits
of the deficit agreement, which pre-set totals for military,
foreign aid and domestic agency spending.
   Within those guidelines, the Senate proposal is closer to
Reagan's priorities than the House plan approved last month. It
includes a 27 percent increase in spending on the space program and
trims back development programs that Reagan proposed to kill.
   The Chiles-Domenici plan also endorses Reagan's plan to give a
4.3 percent pay hike to the military and only 2 percent for
civilian federal workers. The House voted a 3 percent
across-the-board raise.
   Both the House and Senate plans envision big increases in
spending on AIDS research and education grants.
   Like the House, the Senate decided to adopt the administration's
optimistic view of the nation's economy. By doing so, the plan
claims that the deficit will be just $136 billion in the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1, in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget
balancing law.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the
deficit will be about $35 billion higher.
   The budget resolution is a guideline for Congress' fiscal
legislation, and it does not require the president's signature.
However, it has often passed weeks or even months past the April 15
deadline as Congress and the administration battle over spending
priorities.
   Senate action this week and a speedy House-Senate agreement
could make for the earliest budget approval in years.
   The deficit agreement with the president settled for the year
what normally is the biggest battle _ the balance between domestic
and military spending.
   Under the agreement, the budget includes $299.5 billion in
budget authority and $294.0 billion in outlays for the military;
$148.1 billion in budget authority and $169.2 billion in outlays
for annually appropriated domestic programs, and $18.1 billion in
budget authority and $16.1 billion in outlays on foreign aid.
   Budget authority, the legal authority for agencies to spend
their allowances, often differs from cash outlays because the
government doesn't always spend what's authorized during a single
fiscal year.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Reports Sharply Lower 1st Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street giant Merrill Lynch & Co. said
earnings tumbled 37.1 percent in the first quarter compared with a
year earlier, largely because of slumping business in the aftermath
of the October stock market crash.
   The company said earnings totaled $68.3 million in the three
months ended March 31, compared with $108.6 million in the 1987
first quarter. Per-share earnings fell to 62 cents a share from $1
a share.
   Revenue fell 5 percent to $2.4 billion from $2.5 billion.
   Commission revenues, a significant portion of Merrill Lynch's
business, fell 33 percent to $440 million from the year-earlier
record quarterly total of $654 million, which the company
attributed to reduced stock market activity.
   Like other investment giants reacting to the October crash,
Merrill Lynch instituted or accelerated staffing and cost
reductions, anticipating leaner times in what historically has been
a cyclical business.
   ``Given the relatively lower level of activity in the financial
markets during the quarter, these results demonstrate the
broad-based strength and diversity of our core business
operations,'' William A. Schreyer, chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement.
   ``We are also beginning to realize the impact of the structural
cost-reduction programs initiated during the previous quarter,''
Schreyer said.
   Daniel P. Tully, president and chief operating officer, said:
``Obviously, 1988 will be a year of challenges and we are confident
that Merrill Lynch is well positioned to meet them.''
   Merrill Lynch is one of Wall Street's largest full-service
investment firms, with capital of $2.86 billion.

<HEAD>Company Confident $244 Million Antitrust Judgment Will Be
Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.
says an antitrust judgment of at least $244.2 million against the
company conflicts with a Supreme Court decision and likely will be
overturned.
   Landon H. Rowland, president and chief executive officer of
Kansas City Southern, said Saturday the jury award announced Friday
in South Dakota was ``a distressing result which was not expected,
in a matter which has been in progress for years.''
   In the case in federal court in Sioux Falls, S.D., a jury agreed
with the state of South Dakota's contention that the company's
railroad subsidiary, Kansas City Southern Lines, had conspired with
other railroads to block a coal slurry pipeline proposed by Energy
Transportation Systems Inc.
   The jury awarded South Dakota $200 million in antitrust damages,
which the company said would be tripled to $600 million under
federal law. But the jury also provided an alternative award of
$200 million for interference with contractual relations and $44.2
million in punitive and other damages.
   At the end of 1987 Kansas City Southern reported a net worth of
$361 million. The company has a workforce of about 2,500 in Kansas
City.
   Rowland cited a victory in a related case to bolster his
contention that the South Dakota judgment would be overturned on
appeal.
   Kansas City Southern successfully sued in 1982 to block the
federal government from providing water to the slurry pipeline
project. Energy Transportation Systems appealed, but higher courts
upheld the decision, including the Supreme Court in February.
   ``In view of the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in the
ETSI case,'' Rowland said, ``we expect our position to be
vindicated.''
   The slurry pipeline was proposed to carry a mixture of
pulverized coal and water between Wyoming and several southern
states.
   South Dakota had a contract to supply the pipeline with water
from the Missouri River for 50 years, which would have brought $9
million a year in revenue to the state.
   The suit contended Kansas City Southern and others violated
federal antitrust laws in delaying the 1,400-mile, $3.8 billion
pipeline, which would have crossed railroad tracks. Attorneys for
the state produced a document that said Kansas City Southern was
designated to be the lead railroad to fight the project and the
water sale.
   Kansas City Southern argued that it opposed the pipeline, but
that there was no conspiracy. The company also contended that the
project was financially doomed regardless of South Dakota's water
contracts.
   The jury verdict came amid Kansas City Southern's quest to
acquire control of the Southern Pacific railroad. Kansas City
Southern has asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to reject a
competing offer from Rio Grande Industries Inc.

<HEAD>West Point-Pepperell Increases Bid For J.P. Stevens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc. today sweetened its
tender offer for J.P. Stevens & Co. to $1.19 billion, topping a bid
from a New York investment firm in the contest for the textile
giant.
   Under terms of the new offer, Pepperell will pay $67 for each of
the 17.8 million Stevens shares outstanding. The offer, which is
not conditioned on financing, will expire at midnight EDT April 22.
   Pepperell's sweetened offer tops a $64-a-share tender offer
launched by Odyssey Partners, which announced last week that it has
commitments in place to finance its $1.14 billion bid. Stevens
board twice has backed Odyssey in its buyout efforts.
   Under terms of an agreement reached with Odyssey, Stevens board
said it would pay the firm up to $8 million if the New York-based
textile company is acquired by a third party for more than $64 a
share.
   In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens rose
62{ cents to $66.62{ a share.
   Odyssey had charged that a Pepperell merger with Stevens would
violate antitrust laws. But Pepperell said today it reached
agreement last Friday with the Federal Trade Commission on the
terms of its offer, which include selling certain Stevens assets.
   Pepperell has proposed selling half of Stevens' bath lines and
20 percent of its sheet lines for about $170 million. The FTC
approved the definitive agreement for the sale Pepperell had signed
with NTC Group, parent of the textile manufacturer Bidd Co.
   The FTC also waived waiting requirements under federal
disclosure laws but may required Pepperell to sell a sheeting mill,
a yarn plant, certain designer licenses and a brand name, Pepperell
said in a statement.
   Analysts had predicted further bidding in the battle for
Stevens, which operates a number of state-of-the-art sheet and
towel plants.
   The company also has licenses for lucrative designer labels
including Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley, Pierre Cardin, Vanderbilt,
Perry Ellis and Givenchy. Pepperell's brands include Arrow, Martex,
Lady Pepperell and Burberrys.
   Bidding for Stevens began after it received a leveraged buyout
offer from a group led by its own senior management, including
Chairman Whitney Stevens _ a fifth-generation member of the family
that founded the company in 1813.
   The management group initially offered $43 a share and later
sweetened its bid to $55 a share in cash and securities. In a
leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed money
repaid with a target company's profits or the sale of assets.
   Pepperell, of West Point, Ga., last month launched a
$62.50-a-share tender offer after Stevens had reached an agreement
with Odyssey on a buyout at $61.50 a share.
   Odyssey subsequently sweetened its bid to its current
$64-a-share offer.

<HEAD>Soar 77 Cents a Barrel on OPEC Speculation, Shifting Market
Sentiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices jumped 77 cents a barrel early today
to the highest level since early this year, which traders
attributed to speculation that OPEC would enlist outside producers
to restrict world supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May delivery
of West Texas intermediate crude jumped from $16.88 per 42-gallon
barrel Friday to $17.65, an unusually large move that put prices at
the highest point since Jan. 5.
   Experts differed over whether the rise was a short-term
development or reflected a reversal in what has been a dismal oil
market.
   ``The OPEC thing is clearly the reason, there's no question
about it,'' said John O'Dea, manager of international energy
futures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``Whether it
should be that strong or not, who knows. My attitude has been, talk
is cheap with that crowd.''
   The market move followed disclosures that leaders of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would invite
government representatives from at least seven independent
oil-producing nations to meet with five OPEC oil ministers on April
23. All 13 OPEC members are to meet two days later.
   The invitation, announced by a committee of five OPEC oil
ministers on Saturday, was seen as a clear acknowledgement by the
cartel that it alone no longer can exert enough control over oil
supplies to support prices.
   Some analysts said the market's rise today reflected a more
fundamental change in sentiment toward rising prices, and the OPEC
development was merely an excuse to buy.
   ``This is not a flash in the pan. This is the beginning of a
bull move,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of Elders
Futures Inc. in New York. ``The real story is the oil market cycle
has turned; it's ready to go higher.''

   Research ministers of the European Economic
Community on Monday agreed to spend about $2 billion over the next
five years on research in information technology.
   The plan, called ESPRIT II, is designed to help European
companies to compete against the United States and Japan.
   An EEC official said the program, which involves 5,500
researchers from 12 EEC countries, represents about one-third of
all European basic research in information technology.
   The official said ESPRIT research has led to numerous
technological achievements, including the development of T800, the
most powerful chip on the market.
   He said the current phase, which is to begin in late summer,
will continue to center on microelectronics and information
processing.
   Under EEC rules, the Community contributes 50 percent to the
cost of each project, with the rest coming from the member states.
   For the first time since 1984, when ESPRIT was launchhed, the
Community will allow non-member countries, mainly from Scandinavia,
to participate.

   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Verity and a
delegation of American businessmen arrived in Moscow on Monday for
superpower trade talks in advance of next month's summit here.
   Verity told reporters at Sheremetyevo Airport that Washington
``supports the expansion of peaceful, mutually beneficial trade and
economic relations'' with the Soviet Union an that he hoped this
week's meetings would produce new trade agreements.
   About 400 U.S. businessmen plan to take part in the 10th session
of the Joint Commercial Commission, formed in 1973 to bring trade
agencies of the two governments together.
   The trade meetings, which open Tuesday, come six weeks before
President Reagan travels to Moscow for his fourth summit with
Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev and Reagan called during their December meeting in
Washington for joint exploration of trade expansion prospects
during the next commission meeting.
   U.S. sales to the Soviet Union totaled $1.5 billion in 1987, or
only about 0.5 percent of all exports, and two thirds of the
business was in grain sales.
   The volume of U.S.-Soviet trade was three times larger in 1979,
before then-President Jimmy Carter imposed trade sanctions after
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   Verity said before leaving Washington that he did not expect
major breakthroughs during this month's commission meeting, but
that he hoped the talks would create ``a new climate'' in
superpower trade.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade as dealers awaited two potentially
influential Agriculture Department reports.
   Wheat was slightly higher, corn was mostly lower and soybeans
were mixed in early trading.
   This afternoon's USDA supply and demand report was to contain
the government's grain usage estimates and projections for
stockpiles that will be carried over into the next marketing year.
   The USDA's world production report was to include the
government's new estimate for the Brazilian soybean crop, which has
suffered from dry conditions and is now being harvested.
   ``These reports will be coming out after the close and that is
causing some hesitancy here on the part of many traders,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 2\ cents higher with the

   Quaker State Corp. said Monday that it
wants to remain independent after receiving an unsolicited $675
million takeover bid from a group led by Ardshiel Inc., a New York
investment banking firm.
   ``My strong view is that is in the best interests of Quaker
State to remain independent,'' said Chairman Quentin E. Wood in a

   The motor oil refining company made no other comment about the
proposal, submitted Friday by Ardshiel, other than to say it did
not contain definitive financing.
   Ardshiel said it was offering $26.50 per share for the Oil
City-based company, which sells Quaker State motor oil, owns Quaker
State Minit-Lube Inc. drive-in automobile lubrication centers, and
manufactures truck lighting systems and automobile brake lights.
   Ardshiel said it currently owns 3.3 percent interest in the
company. It did not disclose the identities of other investors.
   Dennis McCormick, Ardshiel's senior managing director, said
Ardshiel wanted to continue Quaker State's core businesses.
   Quaker State employs 6,300 people, including about 450 at its
headquarters and research centers in Oil City, a Venango County
community of 13,500. It also has refineries in Farmers Vally,
McKean County, and in Newell, W.Va.

<HEAD>Desert Partners Alters Bid For USG</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Desert Partners LP on Monday increased the
number of USG Corp. shares it is seeking to acquire in its $2.18
billion hostile takeover attempt.
   Under terms of an amended tender offer, Desert Partners said it
would pay $42 a share for 39 million USG shares, or 85 percent of
the building materials company, up from the 21.5 million shares it
initially sought for the same price.
   Remaining shares would be exchanged for securities and notes
valued at $42 a share. With 51.8 million USG shares outstanding,
the offer is valued at about $2.18 billion.
   Desert Partners, which owned a 9.9 percent stake in USG when it
launched the tender offer, said that about 12.6 million shares had
been tendered as of last Friday.
   The latest offer, made possible by additional financing
commitments, would not be subject to Delaware anti-takeover laws,
Desert Partners said in a statement. The offer is set to expire at
midnight EDT April 22.
   USG repeatedly has opposed Desert Partners' overtures and has
urged its stockholders to reject a slate of board candidates
recommended by the Texas group. Six of USG's 15 board seats are up
for election at the May 11 annual meeting.
   Last month, Chicago-based USG, a leading producer of gypsum
wallboard and other building materials, said it was considering
defensive strategies that might include the sale of a major block
of USG stock to a third party to block an unfriendly takeover.
   Separately, Desert Partners said it has received commitments for
$1 billion of the $1.4 billion needed for the offer, including $500
million each from Wells Fargo Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank. An
additional $300 million in subordinated debt will come from
subsidiaries of the Australia'd Elders IXL, which would receive
warrants to purchase up to 22 percent of the company surviving a
merger.
   Desert Partners, a limited partnership led by Texas oilmen Jack
E. Brown and Cyril Wagner Jr., said its offer is conditioned in
part upon the redemption of USG's poison pill. The partnership has
a lawsuit pending in Chicago seeking the elimination of USG's
poison pill rights.

   Jim S. Gilmore Jr.'s office looks more
like the winner's circle at the Indianapolis 500 than corporate
headquarters for his $200 million-a-year business empire.
   Visitors have a hard time figuring out the color of the wall
paint. Photographs and paintings of race cars and triumphant
drivers accepting roses and trophies cover the office walls and
line the corridors from floor to ceiling.
   But Gilmore isn't in the racing business _ at least not for a
profit.
   Most of Gilmore's income is generated by his broadcasting
corporation and automobile dealerships.
   His success in those areas has allowed Gilmore to pursue his
lifelong passion for auto racing, a preoccupation he adopted from
his father. In 1973 Gilmore signed on friend and Indy 500 champion
A.J. Foyt, creating the Gilmore-Foyt Racing Team.
   ``One of the greatest moments in my life was when A.J. won the
Indy 500 for the fourth time (in 1977),'' said Gilmore, 61, a
cheerful, gray-haired man whose blue eyes ignite with excitement
each time he mentions racing.
   The feeling is obviously mutual with Foyt.
   ``I can't say enough about Jim. He's stuck by me through thick
and thin,'' said Foyt, who 15 years later continues to drive
Gilmore-backed cars.
   Though backing a winner in the Indy 500 was a new experience,
Gilmore was already well accustomed to corporate victory. From his
grandfather's profitable downtown Kalamazoo department store,
Gilmore Brothers, Gilmore has created a diverse business empire
with about 1,000 employees.
   Of his three auto dealerships, the one in Miami, Fla., is
consistently among the top four Chevrolet dealerships in the
country, selling as many as 21,000 cars each year, Gilmore says.
Gilmore also recently announced he would become a partner in Foyt's
Chevrolet dealership in Houston.
   Gilmore owns two Midwest television stations, WEHT in
Evansville, Ind., and KODE-TV in Joplin, Mo., and two Florida radio
stations, WLVE in Miami and WIVY in Jacksonville.
   Then there's all that real estate in downtown Kalamazoo,
including several office buildings and parking lots, and the
2,700-acre hog farm in northern Kalamazoo County.
   And more. Gilmore also owns an insurance company, is director of
a Kalamazoo plastics manufacturer and sits on the boards of two
banks. He is a partner in the parent company of the Kalamazoo Wings
hockey team and part-owner of their stadium. He also has minority
interests in a Kalamazoo advertising firm and an automotive
engineering company in Daytona, Fla.
   As if that weren't enough to keep him busy, Gilmore serves on
dozens of local, state and national commissions, ranging from the
President's Council on Sports and Physical Fitness to the local
chamber of commerce.
   The parent company for his holdings, Jim Gilmore Enterprises,
has had annual revenues as high as $300 million.
   In 1985, Forbes listed Gilmore as one of the 400 wealthiest
Americans, estimating his worth at $160 million.
   ``Forbes was close, but a little on the high side,'' Gilmore
says with a smile.
   Maybe so, but it's still not bad for a first-year college
dropout who started out by mopping floors at the family department
store.
   Gilmore is quick to admit that most of the money he started out
with was inherited. After his grandfather died, his grandmother
married the founder of Upjohn Co., the pharmaceutical company,
merging Kalamazoo's two wealthiest families.
   But Gilmore's workaholic and perfectionist tendencies have
allowed him to make the most of his head start.
   After growing tired of working in the family's department store,
Gilmore was elected Kalamazoo's youngest mayor, a position he held
from 1959-61.
   A diehard Republican, Gilmore remained active in politics for
many years, heading five congressional campaigns for former Rep.
Garry E. Brown. Gilmore also made an unsuccessful bid of his own
for a congressional seat in 1980, two years after his first wife
died of cancer.
   ``Running was one of the best things I did in my life, although
losing didn't feel very good,'' said Gilmore, the father of five
grown children and stepfather to his second wife's four children.
   Though Gilmore contends he has no plans to get back into the
political arena, he may be lured to Washington, D.C., if his good
friend of 12 years, Vice President George Bush, is elected
president in November.
   ``I think we're good enough friends that there's a good
possibility I might be asked to do something (in a Bush
administration),'' Gilmore said.
   Gilmore, the public servant, also believes in continuing his
family's tradition of philanthropy. Instead of sharing his profits
with the community through a foundation after his death, Gilmore
says he believes in ``working on things while we're still alive.''
   ``Every night when I get home from work, I put on a sweater and
take a walk downtown and I take notes on things that need to be
done,'' he said.
   And he doesn't believe in procrastination. For example, when a
Kalamazoo homeless shelter needed repairs late last year, Gilmore
donated $30,000 for an immediate renovation.
   Maybe that's why A.J. Foyt gave Gilmore the diamond-studded ring
that went with his Indy victory.
   ``When he gave it to me, he said, `Jim, you may lose everything
else, but you won't lose this.'''

<HEAD>Age of Designer Onions Has Industry All But Crying</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>McALLEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may sound like a childhood nightmare
come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions.
   But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry
officials say the lower Rio Grande Valley's grapefruit-size variety
known as the Texas 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for
more.
   At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the Valley
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion.
   ``They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass
and ship them UPS (United Parcel Service),'' said Dr. Leonard Pike,
a Texas A&M University horticultural scientist who developed the
1015.
   Since 1974, Valley growers have helped fund $1 million in
research grants for the continuing project Pike leads in the quest
for a sweeter, milder onion.
   He released his Texas Grano 1015 _ named for the optimum
planting date of Oct. 15 _ in 1983, providing increasing
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from
Georgia, Hawaii's Maui Maui and California's Imperial Valley.
``Grano'' in the 1015's name means it is a round variety, as
opposed to flatter, ``Granex'' onions.
   ``It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating
onions that didn't eat them before,'' said Dale DeBerry, owner of
Progreso Produce Co. ``You can see that by the number of tourists
who come by here asking for 1015s.''
   On a recent afternoon, a steady stream of winter Texans drove up
to his company near the border town of Progreso, but the round,
yellow 1015s weren't in yet.
   The sweet spring onions are only available for a six-week period
beginning in mid-April.
   DeBerry's company and others have started labeling the 1015s
with individual stickers to help consumers who ask for them by name.
   ``Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I
know that sounds strange,'' said Paula Fouchek, executive director
of the Harlingen-based Texas Fresh Promotional Board, which is
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's
designer onions.
   ``There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,''
she said.
   About 80 percent of Texas' onion crop is the sweet spring
variety, said Erv Sandlin, a promotional marketing coordinator with
the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   Onions last year brought $77.8 million to onion producers in
Texas, making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said
Doug Bierstedt, with the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service.
   Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of
which 14,000 is for the spring crop, Bierstedt said. About 3,500
Texas acres are planted in the 1015.
   Texas' niche in the national market is that its South Texas
spring crop hits the market early, growers say.
   ``We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about
gone and spring begins,'' said Othal Brand Sr., whose McAllen-based
Griffin & Brand Inc. is the largest onion producer in Texas.
   Until the spring onions hit the market, consumers are eating the
more pungent winter storage onions grown in many states.
   On an early spring afternoon, Brand, who is mayor of McAllen,
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop.
   ``Isn't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the
bulbs up. ``The only thing prettier than that is money in the
bank.''
   Other Texas onions usually begin hitting the market before the
1015s are ready. The drawback from the spring crop grown in the
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage,
growers say.
   Pike said he is working on ways to store the spring onions
longer.
   He also is researching just what makes the 1015 mild, and said
it mainly is because of a low level of a substance known as pyruvic
acid, which reacts with sulfur compounds to cause the things that
give the vegetable a bad image.
   ``Very rarely will you get one that will bring tears to your
eyes,'' Pike said.
   The 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said
Pike, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will
eat the mild ones of the spring season.
   Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been
reported at three pounds, according to Pike.
   Bob Scarborough, who manages gift packages for Bartlett Groves
in McAllen, said his company started shipping the special boxes of
onions last year after shipping the more conventional gift citrus
for several years.
   ``As a matter of fact, I still have a little trouble with it
when you equate a package of onions with a gift package of oranges
or grapefruits,'' Scarborough said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Farmers Group Inc. said Monday it was willing
to discuss a takeover by Batus Inc. if Batus follows through on a
suggestion it may raise its $4.5 billion bid.
   Batus, the U.S. subsidiary of the British conglomerate B.A.T.
Industries, termed the letter ``an encouraging development'' and
said it welcomed the chance for negotiation.
   Farmers, the nation's third-largest home and auto insurer and
seventh-biggest property and casualty insurer, opened the door to
talks in a letter from Leo E. Denlea Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``I am requesting hereby that you advise us without delay of any
higher offer you are prepared to make,'' Denlea wrote.
   Denlea offered to share confidential information disclosed to
other potential suitors if Batus agrees to confidentiality
guidelines. He set a Tuesday deadline for Batus' response.
   On March 3, Louisville, Ky.-based Batus launched an unsolicited
$63-a-share offer for the Los Angeles-based insurer. In a letter
Thursday, Batus Chairman Patrick Sheehey said the company would
consider increasing its offer if Farmers management would agree to
negotiate.
   The issue is complicated by a dispute between Batus and
insurance regulators in Kansas, one of nine states in which Farmers
owns insurance companies.
   A hearing is set for April 20 on a Kansas Insurance Department's
order that Batus stop soliciting proxies in support of a resolution
that would require Farmers directors to reconsider their earlier
refusal to negotiate.
   Kansas law requires regulatory approval of any change of control
of an insurer, and defines control partly as holding ``proxies
representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities.''
   ``We feel that we'll meet all the statutory requirements,''
Batus spokesman Wilson Wyatt said Monday.
   B.A.T., a tobacco, retailing and paper-goods conglomerate, has
been seeking a foothold in the U.S. financial services market for
some time.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. today defended its
role in the hostile takeover attempt of Koppers Co., and denounced
the ``bizarre allegation'' that Shearson, rather than a group led
by Beazer PLC, was trying to acquire Koppers.
   ``From an American Express Co. viewpoint, not only do we think
this to be a Shearson transaction and activity in the normal course
of its business, but we also view the uproar by some allies of
Koppers as ill-informed, provcative and ill-advised,'' Harry L.
Freeman, executive vice president of parent company American
Express, told the Senate Banking Committee.
   He said it was ill-informed because of the ``continued erroneous
assertion that that somehow Shearson, rather than Beazer, is trying
to acquire Koppers, which is simply not true and strikes the
management of American Express Co. as a bizarre allegation.''
   Freeman said it was unfair to characterize Shearson Lehman as
having taken an equity position in the takeover attempt. He said
Shearon Lehman was providing advice and bridge financing for the
transaction, both ``normal functions'' for U.S. investment banks.
   But Charles R. Pullin, chairman and chief executive officer of
Koppers, a Pittsburgh construction materials concern, said
Shearson@American Express ``has dominated and actively guided every
aspect of the planning and execution of the Koppers takeover
attempt since its secret initiation one year ago.''
   Beazer's unsolicited cash tenderpoffer of $45 a share on March 3
has since been sweetened to $60 per share.
   Brian C. Beazer, chairman and chief executive officer of the
British materials and construction firm that bears his name, told
the Senate panel, ``I am not a corporate raider.''
   Beazer said his firm was ``not the sort of organization that
seeks to put people out of work, far from it.''
   Commenting on Kopper's refusal to try to negotiate a merger
agreement, Beazer said, ``It appears to me that you can never know
anything aboet an opposing side until you at least can hear their
view.''

<HEAD>Privatization: If It's So Good, Why The Delay?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is a tenet of President Reagan's philosophy,
so deeply imbedded in his political approach that it might be
referred to as a cornerstone of policy.
   Aspects of it were endorsed by the Grace Commission in 1982, by
the General Accounting Office in 1983, by the Office of Management
& Budget in 1984 and by a bipartisan presidential commission in
1988.
   Its efficacy has been shown when used at the local level and
whenever practiced at the federal level. But privatization,
specifically the contracting out of government services now
performed in-house, has grown slowly.
   The reasons why are not surprising, since government has long
been accused of footdragging. But, oddly, some of the skidmarks of
reluctancy seem to have come from the White House itself, in spite
of its avowals of support.
   That curious claim becomes even more so since it is made in a
paper from the Heritage Foundation, which is generally supportive
of the president and has in the past been a font of ideas for the
administration.
   The authors of the study, ``Privatization,'' subtitled ``A
Strategy For Taming The Federal Budget,'' states that ``the most
disheartening obstacle to contracting out has been the Reagan
Administration's lack of initiative ...''
   Editors Steven Moore and Stuart Butler cite a 1985 OMB study of
22 federal agencies showing that in a three-year period half of
them awarded no service contracts to outside firms as the result of
cost comparisons ordained by OMB.
   Though making the story even stranger, some background also
sheds light on at least one the reasons why: Government regulations
_ the same ones meant to encourage contracting out _ put the
outside contractor as a disadvantage.
   Reading through the report, it appears that a self-serving
bureaucracy rather than the White House is the culprit, since the
bureaucracy apparently has the power to frustrate the intent of
top-level orders and goals.
   For example:
   In keeping with OMB circular A-76, private firms must compete
with in-house suppliers through a detailed cost-comparison process.
The agency then must choose the least expensive alternative _
in-house or contracted out.
   But, according to Moore and Butler, ``the cost-comparison
procedure has been transformed by the federal agencies into a de
facto moratorium on contracting out.'' The bureacracy defends
itself well.
   Among other things, it handicaps the private vendor by skewing
the meaning of ``comparison.'' The private bidder, for example,
must beat the in-house cost estimate by at least 10 percent in
order to get the contract.
   That's just the beginning. Unlike the government agency, the
private firm must also include all indirect costs such as rent and
corporate salaries, a process that places private bidders at about
a 35 percent handicap.
   Even worse, the agency itself conducts the cost comparisons and
awards the contracts. The bureaucracy, say Moore and Butler, can
delay the proceedings for as long as three years, ``so that very
few contracts are ever awarded.''
   They maintain that federal contracting-out policy ``is so
routinely disregarded and so fervently opposed by the federal
bureaucracy'' that only a forceful statement by Reagan can put it
back on track.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States dropped by 25 this week to total 916, Baker Hughes
Inc. announced Monday.
   The rig count, the widely-watched industry index of drilling
activity, had posted a slight increase of six the previous week to
total 941.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rigs actively
exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs
producing oil.
   A year ago, the count was 749.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, Texas was the big loser
this week as its count dropped by 12. Counts in Ohio and Oklahoma
were each down by five. Wyoming lost three and Michigan lost two.
   New Mexico, Colorado and North Dakota each lost one rig. Kansas'
rig count increased by three, while California gained two rigs.

   Soviet fertilizer plants will be equipped with
high-technology production control equipment under a
multimillion-dollar venture announced Monday by Honeywell Inc. and
the Soviet government ministry.
   The deal was announced as a group of 400 Americans led by
Commerce Secretary C. William Verity arrived for trade talks with
Soviet officials.
   Prospects for more such joint projects, which the Soviets are
promoting to help stimulate their economy, are a main topic for the
talks of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commercial Commission.
   Honeywell and the Soviet Ministry of Mineral Fertilizer
Production are forming a company that will design automated control
systems for factories under the ministry's jurisdiction and is
expected to sell to third countries as well, said James Verrant, a
Honeywell senior vice president.
   The Soviets hope to boost their fertilizer production by using
the new technology, thereby also improving harvests in the weak
farm economy.
   Honeywell will own 49 percent of the company and the Soviet
ministry will own 51 percent, Verrant said. The company has been
named Sterch, after an endangered species of Siberian crane that
was saved by U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the 1970s.
   A Honeywell statement said the company's investment in the
initial marketing and design phase will be about $1 million.
Verrant told a news conference that once the joint venture begins
installing the production control equipment, purchases from
Honeywell ``could reach somewhere in the neighborhood of $20
million volume'' in the first year of operation.
   Because the Soviet ruble cannot be exchanged for hard currency,
the method of receiving profits is a major problem for Western
firms trying to set up joint ventures with the Soviet Union.
   But Verrant said that under Soviet legislation adopted in
September, the minister of the Soviet fertilizer industry has
access to some of the country's hard currency earnings.
   Honeywell's future income from the project will depend on
increasing the quality and quantity of the fertilizer that can be
marketed to third countries, and on installation in other countries
of systems in plants that the Soviets have helped manage, Verrant
said.
   Most of the joint venture's employees will be Soviets, Verrant
said.
   The agreement will be signed Thursday and official registration
of the company may take a month or more.
   Giorgi Prityko, a top official in the Soviet ministry, said
Bulgaria's 10 years of experience with a similar Honeywell system
was an important reason the Soviets chose the Minneapolis-based
company.
   ``We just adoped the experience acquired by our friends in
Bulgaria,'' he said.
   Members of the Joint Commercial Commission are expected to hear
from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday.
   Verity said last week he expects no breakthroughs in the talks,
although they could improve the climate for greater U.S.-Soviet
trade.
   He said he would stress that expanded trade can take place only
if the Soviets make improvements in other areas such as human
rights and emigration.

   Stock prices rose sharply in thin trading Monday,
bolstered by positive weekend news from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and by a healthy rise in the U.S.
dollar.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 30.8
points, or 1.7 percent, higher at 1,810.5, its best level for the
day.
   Volume, however, was light at 405.4 million shares, down from
508.5 million on Friday.
   Share prices opened strongly, helped by recent rises in New York
and Tokyo.
   In addition, shares, especially in the oil sector, were helped
by news that representatives of OPEC and non-OPEC producers were to
meet to discuss ways to bolster the price of crude oil.
   Britain is the world's fifth-largest oil producer.
   The dollar's rise, and consequent fall in the value of the
pound, gave a lift to international stocks, and dealers said U.S.
buyers were seen in the market taking advantage of the more
favorable exchange rates.
   Dealers said stocks surged to their best levels late in the day
after the 100-share index held above the psychologically
significant level of 1,800 points for most of the session.
   ``The momentum of having broken through 1800 has carried us
on,'' a dealer said.

   The pile of documents involving years of
asbestos-related suits against Manville Corp. has grown so large,
it needs its own warehouse.
   The company announced Monday that it began operation of a
storage plant for the paperwork _ 16 million documents in all.
   The warehouse operation in Englewood is available to those
involved in resolving asbestos health claims against the company.
It was established in cooperation with the Manville Personal Injury
Settlement Trust, the committees representing asbestos health
claimants and other interested parties.
   The trust was established under the Manville bankruptcy plan of
reorganization to settle asbestos health claims against the company.
   The former asbestos maker filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws on Aug. 26,
1982. The bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York
confirmed the company's plan of reorganization on Dec. 22, 1986.
   The company sought bankruptcy protection because of thousands of
lawsuits pending by victims of asbestos, which causes asbestosis,
an often-fatal lung disease. The victims are seeking billions of
dollars, and future claims are expected to develop.
   Experts testified that the claims totaled more than the
company's entire worth.

   The American public may be less willing
than the television industry believes to embrace a high-resolution
TV system with improved picture quality, clearer images and more
brilliant color, according to a study released Monday.
   The results of the study, by the Media Laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ``contradict the accepted
wisdom ... which posits that high definition TV knocks the socks
off everyone who sees it.''
   The study found that, to most viewers, the differences between
conventional TV and high definition TV, called HDTV, are subtle and
that screens would have to be two to three times the size of sets
found in most American living rooms to have a significant impact.
   The Japanese have been working on HDTV for nearly 20 years and
are moving forward quickly. They plan to give a preview of their
system with broadcasts of this summer's Seoul Olympics to HDTV sets
in about 50 big-city department stores throughout the country.
   The picture on a standard television set in the United States is
produced by a signal that scans more than 200,000 dots on 525
lines. The Japanese system has 1,125 scanning lines.
   Of the 613 people who participated in the study, 62 percent said
they preferred the quality of HDTV overall.
   However, ``this indicates that HDTV is not the same kind of
revolutionary shift in technology as experienced in the transition
to color in the 1950s and 1960s in the United States,'' said a
report on the study written by W. Russell Neuman, associate
professor at the Media Laboratory, and released at the National
Association of Broadcasters convention here.
   ``Although engineers and broadcast professionals see the
difference immediately and stronly prefer HDTV ... the differences
are more subtle to the untrained eye of the mass audience,'' the
report said.
   HDTV is the most talked about development at this year's
convention, which began Saturday and ends Tuesday.
   Broadcasters are concerned that U.S. research efforts to develop
an industry transmission standard for HDTV, still years away in the
United States, may not be moving fast enough to head off a probable
Japanese invasion of the new technology.
   HDTV is expected to be introduced by the Japanese to homes in
their country in 1990.
   The Japanese system requires more than the space allocated to TV
channels on the electromagnetic spectrum. In Japan, the HDTV system
called Hi-Vision will be transmitted by satellite to small rooftop
antennas, avoiding the bandwidth problem that would be faced by
over-the-air broadcasting. But special HDTV receivers will be
needed to see the enhanced picture.
   One of the U.S. broadcasters' greatest fears is that the
Japanese will begin exporting to the United States HDTV video
cassette recorders and receiver sets that would not receive
over-the-air broadcast signals.
   ``We're fooling ourselves if we don't think the people in the
video cassette, cable and movie industries are going to take
advantage of that,'' said Michael J. Sherlock of NBC, which is
developing a system that improves picture quality though not as
significantly as the Japanese HDTV system.
   ``Broadcasters could be put out of business or severely hurt if
we take too long'' to meet the competition with an improved
television picture, he said.
   But Neuman's report said the American public is unlikely to rush
out to buy HDTV sets, which are expected to cost upwards of $3,500
when first introduced.
   The Media Lab study, admittedly ``an early experiment,'' was
conducted in a shopping mall in Danvers, Mass., in early December
1987. For 30 minutes, a total of 613 randomly selected shoppers, in
groups of five to 20, watched a variety of programs on conventional
and HDTV sets.
   Though viewers could usually see a difference in picture quality
between the two sets and overall liked HDTV more, they preferred a
conventional picture for some of the programming, the study found.

<HEAD>Unsuccessful Buyer of Dalkon Shield Maker Seeks $34 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A.H. Robins Co. told a federal judge Monday
his decision to set $2.475 billion in compensation for Dalkon
Shield victims helped kill a pending buyout of the pharmaceutical
company.
   But a lawyer for Rorer Group Inc., which planned to acquire
Robins, told U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. the judge's
ruling did not automatically destroy Robins' pact with Rorer.
   Merhige and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Blackwell N. Shelley listened
to arguments on whether Robins should pay a $25 million
``break-up'' fee to Rorer plus $9 million in expenses associated
with the failed merger.
   The Rorer-Robins pact, negotiated last November, included the
$25 million fee to Rorer if the deal fell through. Its key
provision called for paying $1.75 billion to women who suffered
injuries from using the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, which
Robins sold in the early 1970s.
   A month after the agreement was reached, Merhige determined that
$2.475 billion was needed for Dalkon Shield compensation.
   Dennis Drebsky, an attorney for Robins, said the agreement with
Rorer ``for all intents and purposes was a dead letter'' after the
higher compensation figure was established.
   ``They were Siamese twins, and when one of the twins died the
other went with it,'' Drebsky said of the Rorer merger and its
$1.75 billion compensation proposal.
   But Arthur L. Liman, the attorney for the Rorer Group, said his
company had the sole right to withdraw from the agreement when the
higher figure was set. Robins had no such right, he said.
   Also, Liman said Robins officials continued to negotiate with
Rorer executives after Merhige's decision as if the two firms could
adjust the terms of their deal to accomodate the larger
compensation.
   ``Robins knew the agreement was not dead,'' he said. ``It was
clinging to it'' in case talks with two other potential buyers, the
American Home Products Corp. of New York and the Paris-based Sanofi
SA, a major European pharmaceutical manufacturer, fell through.
   Robins accepted an American Home Products offer in late January.
   The judges did not rule immediately on Rorer's request for the
break-up fee, but Merhige said the Fort Washington, Pa. company
would not receive all the $9 million in expenses.
   Merhige interrupted arguments on the dispute for about two hours
Monday to allow the attorneys to try to work out a settlement, but
no deal was struck.
   Robins, the Richmond-based maker of the Robitussin series of
cough medicines and other pharmaceuticals, has been in federal
bankruptcy court under Chapter 11 protection from creditors since
August 1985.
   The chief issue in the company's reorganization has been
payments to some 195,000 women with injury claims because of the
IUD.
   Robins' merger with American Home Products and the Dalkon Shield

are mailed out April 25. Votes are due back July 11, and Merhige
has set July 18 for a hearing on confirmation of the reorganization
plan.

   The chairman of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
told shareholders Monday that a top priority this year will be
eliminating about $3.6 billion in debt incurred in fending off Sir
James Goldsmith's 1986 takeover attempt.
   Robert E. Mercer also said he expected 1988 earnings to surpass
the $770.5 million earned last year, which included $257 million
from discontinued operations.
   At the shareholders' meeting, Mercer said that reducing debt
caused by Goodyear's anti-takeover stock buyback plan would require
several measures, including possibly divesting its interest in a
joint pipeline.
   Mercer said a recent court ruling permitting the final segment
of the All American Pipeline in Texas should enhance the sale
prospects.
   The pipeline is a project of Celeron Oil and Gas, a former
Goodyear subsidiary until it was sold last year as Goodyear
concentrated on its core tire business.
   ``Continuing advances in cost control, and keeping capital
expenditures as close to depreciation levels as is competitively
practical, should allow us to make some contribution to the debt
reduction this year from operating income,'' Mercer added. ``In our
assessment of the remainder of 1988, the global tire market looks
promising.''
   Meanwhile, Executive Vice President Stanley J. Mihelick
confirmed that Goodyear is considering building a new tire plant in
Canada.
   A 550-acre site in Napanee, Ontario, about 25 miles west of
Kingston, Ontario, could be home for a radial tire plant, subject
to working out details with Canadian authorities, he said.
   The Ontario government has approved a $32 million loan to assist
in establishing the plant.
   During the weekend, the United Rubber Workers union targeted
Goodyear for negotiations toward a three-year labor contract that
labor leaders say will set the tone for negotiations with the rest
of the industry.
   A 12-member advisory committee on Saturday unanimously chose
Goodyear over companies such as Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. as the
pattern-setting company, according to a news release from Milan
Stone, URW's international president.

   Soybean futures closed as much as 5 cents a
bushel higher Monday on the belief that a late-season dry spell had
seriously damaged the Brazilian soybean crop. Grain futures were
mixed to slightly higher.
   Trading activity was light ahead of two U.S. Department of
Agriculture reports on grain supply and demand and foreign crop
production.
   The world production report was expected to show a reduction of
0.5 million metric tons in the USDA's estimate of the Brazilian
soybean crop, which is now being harvested, said Jerry Gidel, an
analyst in Chicago with G.H. Miller & Co. The agency had previously
pegged the Brazilian harvest at 18.5 million tons.
   ``The market followed through here a little on the deterioration
of the Brazilian crop,'' Gidel said.
   Wheat futures closed mostly higher while corn was narrowly mixed.
   At the close, wheat was \ cent lower to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.17{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents

<HEAD>Nixon Relative Helps Swing Billboard Deal in China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Nixon opened China to Americans in the
early 1970s. Now his son-in-law is opening China to more and better
advertising billboards.
   China's eagerness to put up more billboards is a sign of
progress in the Communist nation, Edward Cox said Monday in
announcing a deal between China and Patrick Media Group Inc. of
Scranton, Pa.
   ``If you're going to have a market-oriented economy, the most
important thing is free passing of information, and advertising is
a big part of that,'' Cox said in an interview.
   Cox, a finance lawyer and the husband of Patricia Nixon Cox,
acted as a go-between on behalf of Patrick Media, which bills
itself as the world's largest outdoor advertising company.
   Patrick Media will give the Chinese advice on such matters as
standardizing the sizes of billboards, upgrading its paint and
attracting business from non-Chinese advertisers.
   ``An initiative like this, like sports or arts, transcends
advertising or business. It goes to the germ of our being,'' said
Gerard P. Joyce, the company's 36-year-old president and chief
executive.
   With more than 1 billion consumers and only about 7,000
billboards, China is ``a little more naked'' than the United
States, Joyce said, meaning that each advertising message has more
impact.
   China hopes to increase its number of billboards to 10,000
within five years, said Zhao Guihong, general manager of the China
National United Advertising Corp., which is responsible for almost
all Chinese advertising billboards.
   Zhao is leading a group of Chinese advertising officials in a
nine-day, six-city tour of Patrick Media's U.S. operations. Others
on the tour include regional officials from Shanghai, Nanjing,
Beijing and Chengdu.
   Outdoor advertising accounts for about 25 percent of advertising
expenditures in China, compared to less than 2 percent in the
United States, Patrick Media said. One reason is that Chinese
characters can be understood by all literate Chinese regardless of
the language or dialect they speak.
   Cox said he approached Zhao's group last year on behalf of
Patrick Media. He said the contact was a sidelight to the main
purpose of his visit, which was to visit China as an emissary for
former President Nixon, who wanted to ascertain whether economic
reforms were continuing.
   Cox said large-character posters are protected by the Chinese
constitution. ``It used to be a political message,'' he said. ``Now
the message is an advertising message.''
   Joyce declined to say how Patrick Media would be paid for its
services. He said the matter was still under negotiation. Patrick
Media will act as exclusive adviser to the Chinese on all outdoor
advertising joint venture operations.
   Joyce founded Patrick Media at age 18 and remains its majority
shareholder. The company swelled from a three-market operation into
a $200 million-a-year giantwhen he engineered the $710 million
acquisition of the assets of Foster and Kleiser from Metromedia
Inc. in 1986.

<HEAD>Shearson Defends Role In Koppers Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. on Monday defended
its role in the hostile takeover attempt of Koppers Co. against
senators' claims the American Express Co. subsidiary had crossed
the line between banking and commerce.
   ``From an American Express Co. viewpoint, not only do we think
this to be a Shearson transaction and activity in the normal course
of its business, but we also view the uproar by some allies of
Koppers as ill-informed, provocative and ill-advised,'' Harry L.
Freeman, executive vice president of parent company American
Express, told the Senate Banking Committee.
   He said it was ill-informed because of the ``continued erroneous
assertion that somehow Shearson, rather than Beazer PLC, is trying
to acquire Koppers, which is simply not true and strikes the
management of American Express Co. as a bizarre allegation.''
   Beazer is a British materials and construction concern. It led a
group that made an unsolicited cash tender offer of $45 a share for
Koppers on March 3, a deal that has since been sweetened to $60 per
share, or $1.7 billion. The Pittsburgh-based Koppers produces
construction materials and chemicals and employs 1,300 people in
the Pittsburgh area and 12,300 nationwide.
   Freeman said it was unfair to characterize Shearson as having
taken an equity position in the takeover attempt.
   Steven B. Wolitzer, managing director of Shearson, said the
firm's role was limited to providing short-term, or ``bridge,''
financing for Beazer's tender offer and giving advice. Such
financing is ``typical for investment banks in deals of this
kind,'' he said.
   Wolitzer also said Shearson was contributing equity of its own
of $23 million in the bidding group, but he said management and
control of the group would be held by Beazer PLC.
   But Charles R. Pullin, chairman and chief executive officer of
Koppers, said Shearson ``has dominated and actively guided every
aspect of the planning and execution of the Koppers takeover
attempt since its secret initiation one year ago.''
   ``In effect, what we have is a bank acting as a corporate
raider,'' said Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.
   Shearson has crossed the traditional boundary separating banking
from commerce and industry, said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   ``Shearson is only the first to cross a line that Wall Street
believes will be obliterated by others racing across it in the
future,'' Heinz said.
   Without naming anyone, Freeman said it was ``odd'' that
government officials had ``jumped into the fray without taking care
to learn about the proposed acquiring company or to familiarize
itself with its management and its track record in the U.S. and
abroad.''
   Brian C. Beazer, chairman and chief executive officer of the
firm that bears his name, told the Senate panel, ``I am not a
corporate raider.''
   Beazer said his firm was ``not the sort of organization that
seeks to put people out of work, far from it.''
   Commenting on the refusal by Koppers to try to negotiate a
merger agreement, Beazer said, ``It appears to me that you can
never know anything about an opposing side until you at least can
hear their view.''
   Beazer's offer has been extended until April 15 while courts
consider legal challenges by Koppers that have slowed the takeover
bid.

<HEAD>Japanese Trade Deficit Declines From 1987 Level, Widens From March
Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus continued to decline from
year-earlier levels in March, although it widened from February's
surplus, the Finance Ministry announced Monday.
   The surplus totaled $7.458 billion, down from $8.050 billion in
March 1987, bu up from $5.238 billion the previous month.
   After seasonal adjustment, the surplus came to $6.552 billion,
up from $6.479 billion in the previous month.
   Japan registered a trade surplus of $3.4 billion with the United
States, down from $3.77 billion a year earlier.
   Finance Ministry officials characterized the figures as
encouraging because of the year-to-year decline.
   The continuing shrinkage in the latest report was attributed to
the high yen, which has slowed the growth of exports while boosting
the yen's purchasing power and the value of imports flowing into
the country.
   Imports surged much faster than exports, rising 35 percent to
$15.21 billion from $11.26 billion a year earlier.
   Exports grew by a comparatively muted 17.4 percent to $22.67
billion from $19.31 billion a year earlier.
   Seasonally adjusted imports in the month dipped 3.9 percent to
$14.76 billion from $15.36 billion in February, while adjusted
exports inched down 2.4 percent to $21.31 billion from $21.84
billion.
   Exports to the United States rose 15.8 percent to $7.17 billion,
while American imports rose 55.8 percent to $3.77 billion.
   Motor vehicle imports from the United States soared 112.7
percent from a year earlier to $20.01 million. Food imports rose
47.1 percent to $805.1 million, while textile imports surged 87.8
percent to $78.6 million.
   Japan's exports of passenger vehicles to the United States rose
56 percent to $1.29 billion. Overall electrical machinery exports
were up 11.4 percent to $1.57 billion, although television set
exports fell 23 percent to $27.38 million.

   The stock market showed some spotty gains in an
erratic session today, extending last week's rally.
   Trading was relatively quiet.
   Stocks rose in the Tokyo and London markets as traders around
the world looked for positive news on the dollar from meetings
scheduled this week of the so-called Group of Seven industrialized
nations.
   Analysts are also expecting signs of continuing shrinkage in the
U.S. trade deficit when the Commerce Department reports Thursday on
the nation's trade balance for February.
   However, interest rates rose a bit in the government securities
market today. Brokers said that took some of the edge off
enthusiasm for U.S. stocks.

<HEAD>Irving Posts 84 Percent Profit Jump in 1st-Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. said Monday its first-quarter
profit jumped 83 percent as tax benefits combined with strong
growth in interest income and other gains more than offset a rise
in costs.
   The company, which is fighting a hostile takeover bid from Bank
of New York Co., said its profit rose to $52.4 million, or $2.71 a
share, in the first quarter compared with $28.6 million, or $1.51 a
share, a year earlier.
   Chairman Joseph A. Rice said the results included $12.3 million
in tax benefits related to the loan-loss provisions that the
company took in 1987 in anticipation of problems in collecting some
Third World loans.
   Net interest income rose 12 percent to $146.9 million from
$131.2 million a year earlier as the difference between what the
bank paid in interest to obtain funds and what it received on its
money widened in the banking company's favor.
   In the quarter, Irving took a provision for credit losses of
$19.6 million in 1988 compared with $21.8 million in 1987. That
left its loan loss allowance at $696.5 million, or 4.38 percent of
loans, compared with $224.8 million, or 1.62 percent of loans, a
year earlier.
   Noninterest income increased 16 percent to $119 million from
$102.6 million a year earlier, including a 24 percent rise in trust
income. Securities trading generated revenue of $6.3 million in
contrast with a loss of $2.8 million a year earlier.
   Noninterest expenses rose 11 percent to $179 million, including
a 10 percent rise in salary and employee benefits.
   Irving said earlier this month that it expects to earn $234
million in all of 1988 in contrast to a loss of $193.2 million a
year earlier.
   It is trying to convince its shareholders to reject Bank of New
York's $1.08 billion tender offer of cash and securities for all of
Irving's stock.
   Bank of New York is offering 1.575 shares of its own stock and
$15 a share in cash for each of the 18.4 million shares of Irving
stock that it doesn't already own.
   But Irving has argued that its advisers rate the offer as
inadequate.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
except the Canadian dollar Monday as traders awaited a meeting of
finance ministers and the release of U.S. trade figures.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $450.70 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $449
late Friday.
   The dollar rose despite a report that Japan's trade surplus in
March was a larger-than-expected $7.46 billion, including a $3.4
billion surplus with the United States.
   Traders were already so short on dollars that they were
reluctant to sell more in reaction to the news, said Garrett Glass,
vice president for foreign exchange at First National Bank of
Chicago.
   When the dollar showed resistance to being pushed down, traders
went the other direction and bought the currency, Glass said. But
in late New York trading the dollar fell from its highs of the day.
   Foreign exchange traders said speculation that Wednesday's
meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations would produce
statements supporting the dollar inspired dealers to cover their
positions and buy dollars.
   West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said Monday
that the G-7 meeting is likely to reaffirm last December's
agreement on economic-policy cooperation and the stabilization of
exchange rates.
   There was some speculation in the market that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit for February would dip below $10 billion,
compared with $12.4 billion in January, but average estimates were
slightly more than $11 billion.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.53 yen to a closing 125.71 yen. It gained
more ground in London, closing at 126.70 yen. Later, in New York,
the dollar rose to 126.18 yen from 125.68 late Friday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.8560 dollars to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8755 late Friday.
In New York, the dollar strengthened to $1.8608 for a pound from
$1.8757 for a pound late Friday.
   Other dollar rates in late New York trading, compared with rates
late Friday, included: 1.6812 West German marks, up from 1.6742;
1.3914 Swiss francs, up from 1.3842; 1.2402 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2469; 5.7138 French francs, up from 5.6775; and 1,246.45
Italian lire, up from 1,241.13.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday's rates: 1.6855
West German marks, up from 1.6725; 1.3953 Swiss francs, up from
1.3825; 5.7145 French francs, up from 5.6715; 1.8910 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8790; 1,249.50 Italian lire, up from 1,241.75;
and 1.2390 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2478.
   The bid price for gold in London was $449.50 a troy ounce, down
from Friday's bid of $451.50. In Zurich, the bid price was $449,
down slightly from $449.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 84 cents an ounce to close at a
bid $451.95. At the end of the trading day on the Commodity
Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery was bid at
$452.80 a troy ounce, up from $451.60 late Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London late Monday at a bid price of $6.42
a troy ounce, down from Friday's $6.48. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery was bid at $6.444 a troy ounce, up
from $6.410 late Friday.

   Boeing Co. declined Monday to comment on reports
that four major airlines had reported defects in the aerospace
company's 747 and 767 widebody jets.
   The problems reportedly ranged from wrong parts to incorrectly
installed firefighting systems.
   T. Craig Martin, a spokesman for Boeing's commercial airplane
division, deflected questions about the reports, saying the company
planned to hold a news conference Tuesday to discuss the matter.
   The newspaper accounts said Boeing had received complaints of
defects from American Airlines, Japan Air Lines, All Nippon Airways
and British Airways.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer said Monday that All Nippon, a
Japanese domestic carrier, disclosed it told Boeing of several
instances of poor workmanship in 747 and 767 airliners, mostly on
newly delivered planes.
   The problems included a wing flap disintegrating in flight on
the first day of service, smoke from a misassembled power unit that
caused an emergency landing, and problems in a fire extinguisher
system, All Nippon said.
   Dean Thornton, head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, was quoted
by the newspaper as saying a jetliner ``is a big complicated piece
of machinery.''
   The complaints were ``isolated instances that shouldn't
happen,'' he said. ``We're gonna bust our butt to make sure they
don't happen again.''
   Yoshiyuki Funatsu, All Nippon executive vice president, told the
Post-Intelligencer that problems with defects had been increasing
recently at Boeing. He said that while many had been minor, some
had safety ramifications, although none of the defects had caused
accidents.
   Bob Baker, American Airlines' senior vice president for
operations, told the newspaper the company's maintenance crews had
found faulty fire-suppression systems in the cargo holds of three
767-200s. The system pipes fire-fighting chemicals to the forward
and aft compartments of the cargo hold.
   ``The pipes were misrouted,'' Baker said. ``If you light them
off for the forward belly system they go off in the rear.''
   Baker said that after being informed of the problem by American,
Boeing found one faulty system on its production line and All
Nippon and Japan Air Lines found several in their planes.
   Last week, it was reported that Japan Air Lines President Susumu
Yamaji had complained of manufacturing mistakes in a March 30
letter to Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz. Besides the fire
extinguisher system, the airline complained about engine
temperature sensors being installed in reverse order in a 747,
which would cause temperature gauges to register for the wrong
engines.
   In its Saturday editions, the Seattle Times published excerpts
from a letter from D.K. Craig, British Airways' chief engineer for
technical and quality services, to Phil Condit, executive vice
president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
   Craig said British Airways inspectors at Boeing's plant found
problems in their jets ranging from missing fasteners to wrong or
missing parts. One missing part caused the floor of a jet to bow so
much that a main deck cargo power drive unit would not work, the
Times said.
   ``My quality inspectors can only properly inspect a very small
proportion of each aircraft,'' Craig wrote. ``They should never
ever come across ... missing fasteners, missing parts, cracks,
bodged rivets, fasterners fitted the wrong way round. Yet we find
instances of some of these on every aircraft.''

   Emhart Corp. has agreed to acquire
Price Pfister Inc. in a deal valued at about $215 million, it was
announced Monday.
   Under a definitive merger pact approved by the board of

Price Pfister's 11.4 million outstanding common shares for about
$18.50.
   The merger requires formal approval by a majority of Price
Pfister's stockholders.

conventional and decorative faucets, valves, and fittings. It has
about 1,600 employees.
   Farmington-based Emhart is a diversified, multinational producer

<HEAD>Study Says Chrysler Plant Closing To Cost Taxpayers $209 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s planned closing of its
Kenosha auto plant would cost $209 million in welfare and
unemployment benefits, along with lost taxes, for the first two
years after the shutdown, a union-commissioned study concluded
Monday.
   The analysis by the Midwest Center for Labor Research in Chicago
estimated that the plant's closing would cost federal, state and
local governments a total of $38,000 for each unemployed Chrysler
worker.
   Chrysler announced in January it plans to end auto production at
Kenosha by Sept. 30, resulting in the layoffs of 5,500 workers.
Chrysler took over the plant last year as part of its purchase of
American Motors Corp.
   ``Of about the two dozen studies that we've done, that's the
highest figure we've ever come up with,'' Greg LeRoy, MCLR research
director, told a news conference at the United Auto Workers Local
72 headquarters.
   LeRoy said the study, which was commissioned by the union local,
was based on a previous MCLR study in 1985 but used more
comprehensive welfare and employment figures from the state,
Kenosha and Racine counties and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   It estimated that the plant's closing would result in $62.4
million in unemployment compensation, $54.5 million in lost federal
income tax revenue, $26 million in lost Social Security tax
revenue, $21.4 million in welfare expenditures and $17 million in
lost state sales and excise tax revenue.
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson has threatened to sue Chrysler,
claiming the Detroit-based automaker broke a promise to keep the
plant open for five years.
   Chrysler officials have said they may have been overly
optimistic when negotiating with the state for improvements and job
training funds, but have repeatedly denied making any such promise.
   The study indicated that 53.1 percent of the Kenosha workers
would still be unemployed two years after the plant's closing.
   In addition, the study estimated that 9,796 other workers in the
state would be dislocated by the shutdown. Most of those jobs would
be in companies that supply Chrysler as well as people in retail,
service and other jobs supported by the buying power of Chrysler
workers.
   ``In an economy like this, the absorbtion rate just isn't there.
If jobs aren't there, people aren't going to get re-employed,''
LeRoy said.
   He said the figures for Kenosha were higher than those in other
communities hit by large plant shutdowns because of several
different factors in the southeastern Wisconsin economy and in the
status of unionized Chrysler workers. Among the differences he
cited:
   _Kenosha has an above average unemployment rate which has
remained above the national average for several years.
   _The area is strongly dependent on employment at the plant. More
than one-third of the area's total jobs would be lost with the
shutdown.
   _Chrysler workers make above average salaries and wages,
$29,120, and have benefits that many other potential employers in
Kenosha do not have.
   _Unionized workers in general have a harder time finding new
employment.
   LeRoy said the study also estimated that Chrysler workers would
experience a loss in living standards within the first two years.
With welfare and compensation benefits and new employment, the
worker's average income in the second year would still decline by
77.5 percent, he said.
   Local 72 negotiator Rudy Kuzel said the union commissioned the
study as a public service. ``Some people in the public perceive
this as a problem for the workers in the plant and don't realize
it's going to cost them a lot of money also,'' he said.
   Kuzel said the study would be sent to state and local officials
to aid in negotiations with Chrysler.

<HEAD>AT&T Makes Unix Software Easier To Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&T on Monday announced changes to make it
easier for customers to use computers based on its Unix operating
system.
   The new Open Look feature of Unix software will allow users to
manipulate the computer with graphic symbols instead of written
commands, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said.
   The changes represent another step toward acceptance of Unix in
the business world. Until recently, Unix was seen as mainly for
science and engineering.
   Open Look was designed for AT&T by Sun Microsystems Inc., the
burgeoning maker of engineering workstations based in Mountain
View, Calif.
   Sun's design is based on original work, contributions from AT&T
and technology licensed from Xerox Corp., which originated many of
the ideas for graphic screen symbols, the companies said.
   The Open Look screen somewhat resembles that of Apple Computer
Inc.'s Macintosh. Apple, famed for the ease of use of its
computers, has been fighting to protect its turf and recently sued
Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. over a software copyright
issue.
   Apple spokeswoman Brooke Cohan said the company had no comment
on the AT&T announcement.
   Unix is a base layer of software in a computer that serves as a
traffic cop for its internal operations. Open Look is a ``user
interface,'' which determines the look and feel of a computer to
someone sitting at the keyboard.
   A wide range of companies endorsed Open Look, including software
makers such as Lotus Development Corp., Ashton-Tate Corp. and
Oracle Corp.; computer makers such as Unisys Corp., Amdahl Corp.
and NCR Corp., and chip makers such as Motorola Inc. and National
Semiconductor Corp.
   AT&T will circulate specifications of Open Look for comment
starting this summer and will make the available in the year's
third quarter. Software that is written to use Open Look will be
available mainly in 1989 and after.

<HEAD>OPEC Speculation Ignites Oil Price Surge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculation that OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing nations will
cooperate on limiting their output of crude oil sent energy futures
prices soaring Monday to their highest level of the year.
   On other markets, copper futures fell sharply while precious
metals advanced; livestock and meat futures moved higher; grains
and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude
oil shot up $1.01 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange to $17.89, the highest U.S. oil futures price since Dec.
11.
   Prices for future delivery of unleaded gasoline and heating oil
also posted unusually sharp gains on news that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would invite representatives from at
least seven independent oil-producting nations to meet with five
OPEC oil ministers on April 23.
   ``They're not really calling this an emergency session, but it
nonetheless indicates they're more serious about doing something
about prices and production than most traders foresaw last week,''
said Jim Ritterbusch, vice president of trading for Carson
Petroleum Co., a Chicago-area distributor.
   Unleaded gasoline settled 1.95 cents to 2.18 cents higher with
May at 50.95 cents a gallon; heating oil was 2 cents to 2.42 cents
higher with May at 47.88 cents a gallon.
   Copper prices fell sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange in
mostly technical trading. The contract for April delivery lost 4.60
cents, settling at $1.012 a pound.
   Precious metals advanced in reaction to the sharp rise in oil
futures but gains were limited by the dollar's strong performance,
said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co.
   Gold settled $1 to $1.20 higher with the active June contract at
$454.70 a troy ounce; silver was 3.2 cents to 3.4 cents higher with
April at $6.444 a troy ounce.
   Most livestock and meat futures advanced on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in anticipation of higher cash prices, analysts
said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .50 cent higher with April at
75.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .75 cent higher
with April at 80.85 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent to .65 cent
higher with April at 46 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .70
cent lower to .55 cent higher with May at 55.02 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures gained as much as 4\ cents a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade on ideas that a late-season dry spell had
seriously damaged the Brazilian soybean crop. Grain futures were
mixed to slightly higher.
   Trading activity was light ahead of the Agriculture Department's
monthly reports on foreign crop production and U.S. grain supply
and demand.
   The reports, issued after the close, estimated the Brazilian
crop at 18 million metric tons, down from the USDA's March estimate
of 18.5 million metric tons.
   In its supply-demand report, the USDA estimated 290 million
bushels of soybeans would remain in storage on Aug. 31, the end of
the current soybean marketing year. That compares with a March
estimate of 315 million bushels, and probably will support soybean
prices, Gidel said.
   The USDA also revised its estimate for wheat ending stocks from
1.281 billion bushels to 1.231 billion bushels, but left its
estimate for corn ending stocks unchanged at 4.123 million bushels.
   Wheat settled \ cent to 1{ cents higher with May at $3.17{ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to } cent higher with May at $2.07}
a bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents higher with May at $1.67} a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4\ cents higher with May at $6.82
a bushel.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 1.30 points higher at 271.20. The underlying spot
index ended .73 point higher at 270.16.

   A French industrial group said Monday it
began a $75.9 million tender offer for Wolverine Technologies Inc.,
a maker of vinyl siding and windows for the home remodeling
industry.
   The $23-a-share bid by SG Acquisition Corp., a subsidiary of
Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, topped a March 16 offer of $18.50 a
share by Ply-Gem Industries Inc.
   Wolverine had agreed to be acquired by Ply-Gen, but the company
said its board would consider Saint-Gobain's bid.
   The Saint-Gobain offer extends through May 6 and is conditional
on at least 2.1 million of Wolverine's 3.3 million outstanding
shares being tendered, said Toney File, a Saint-Gobain spokesman in
New York.
   Saint-Gobain manufactures industrial products including flat
glass, insulation, containers, fiber reinforcement, industrial
ceramics, pipe and machinery, and includes a contracting and
services unit.
   It has more than 300 plants and 140,000 employees in 17
countries.

<HEAD>Grolier Agrees To $448 Million Acquisition By French Publisher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grolier Inc.'s board of directors on Monday
unanimously accepted a $448.6 million cash takeover offer from
French media giant Hachette SA.
   Under the definitive merger agreement announced on Sunday,
Hachette, France's biggest publisher and the second-largest in
Europe, would pay $24.25 cash per share for the roughly 95 percent
of Grolier's 19.5 million common shares it does not already own.
   Grolier also granted Hachette the option to acquire about 18.5
percent of its outstanding common stock for $24.25 per share under
certain conditions. Such ``lockup options'' commonly are used to
discourage competing bidders.
   The definitive agreement marks the second time Hachette has
sweetened its offer for Grolier. The French company initially
offered $21 a share for Grolier on March 13, later sweetening the
bid to $24 a share after Grolier rejected the initial offer as
inadequate.
   Hachette, which has indicated it chiefly was interested in
Grolier's encyclopedia publishing business, said Friday it had
agreed to sell Grolier's Childcraft Education Corp. to Walt Disney
Co. for $52 million if its takeover bid succeeded. Childcraft
markets educational toys by direct mail.
   Spokesman Amory Hall said that agreement would remain in force
under the definitive merger proposal.
   Grolier is an international publisher of encyclopedias,
reference and educational books,juvenile books and furniture, trade
publications and yearbooks. Grolier also owns Mystic Color Labs, a
mail-order film processor.
   The company has about 7,200 employees.
   Grolier posted a profit of $22.1 million on revenue of $424.2
million in its 1987 fiscal year, up from net income of $12.5
million on revenue of $350.6 million the previous year.
   The 162-year-old Hachette, which reported sales of more than $3
billion in 1987, has operations i book and magazine publishing and
distribution, radio broadcasting, movie and television production
and outdoor advertising.
   Hachette publishes magazines such as Elle, Paris Match and a new
French edition of Fortune, and owns Curtis Circulation Co., which
it describes as the second largest national magazine distributor in
the United States.

   Dow Jones & Co. Inc. said its first-quarter
profit climbed 55.3 percent from a year ago as its revenue rose
37.5 percent and the company reported a huge gain on the sale of a
book publishing subsidiary.
   Dow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal and
Barron's, said its profit amounted to $103.6 million, or $1.08 a
share, in the three months ended March 31 compared with $66.7
million, or 69 cents a share, a year ago.
   First-quarter revenue rose to $392.5 million from $285.6 million
a year earlier.
   The latest results included an after-tax gain of $64.5 million
from the previously reported sale of the book publisher Richard D.
Irwin Inc. for $135 million. First-quarter results in 1987 included
an after-tax gain of $29.4 million, or 30 cents a share, from the
sale of the company's 18.9 percent interest in the South China
Morning Post Ltd.
   Excluding those gains for each period, earnings were up 4.8
percent to $39.2 million in the latest quarter compared with $37.4
million a year earlier.
   Operating income for the quarter rose 54.2 percent to $91.1
million from $59.1 million in 1987.
   The company said the increase in operating income reflected
contributions from Telerate Inc., the electronic financial
information service that is 56 percent owned by Dow Jones, and the
continued growth of Dow Jones' community newspapers.
   Operating income in the business publications segment fell 22.7
percent to $32.6 million as revenue slipped 4.6 percent in the
quarter, partly reflecting lower levels of financial advertising in
the wake of the October stock market crash.
   Operating income from the information services segment which
includes Telerate results more than fourfold to $54.3 million as
revenue more than tripled.
   Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community services segment, said
its operating income rose 3.7 percent to $8.5 million as revenue
rose 11.5 percent.

<TEXT>
   Primerica Corp. has agreed to sell
Musicland Group Inc. and three of its insurance subsidiaries in
deals expected to net it about $700 million, the company announced
Monday
   The Greenwich-based company said it signed a definitive
agreement to sell Musicland for about $410 million in a leveraged
buyout to an investor group that included senior members of the
business's management.
   Primerica also agreed to sell three of its insurance
subsidiaries and affiliated marketing and management companies to
American National Insurance Co. of Galveston, Texas, for about $235
million, but will incur a one-time loss of about $49 million on the
sale.
   Musicland is the nation's largest specialty retailer of
prerecorded music and video home entertainment products.
   The sales of the insurance businesses and Musicland are part of
Primerica's previously announced strategy of simplifying its
operations and strengthening its financial position.
   Gerald Tsai Jr., Primerica chairman, chief executive officer and
president, said the proceeds from the sales would be used to reduce
debt.
   During the past four months, Primerica stated, it has completed
or announced transactions that together are anticipated to result
in gross proceeds to the company of about $860 million.
   ``We will continue to focus on the sale of other non-strategic
assets,'' Tsai said Monday.
   Primerica said it expected to complete the Musicland sale in the
second quarter of 1988.
   A one-time, after-tax gain of $130 million was anticipated as a
result of the leveraged buyout of Musicland by an investor group
headed by Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette and Musicland's senior
management, Primerica said in a statement.
   Primerica said it expects to participate in the leveraged buyout
by purchasing up to 20 percent of the company's common stock for
$10 million and $8 million worth of preferred stock.
   The transaction is subject to approval by Musicland shareholders.
   As of Dec. 31, 1987, Musicland operated 616 stores in 47 states
under the names Musicland, Sam Goody and Discount Records. Its 1987
revenue was $510.5 million.
   In the insurance deal, American National will buy Pennsylvania
Life Insurance Co., Executive Fund Life Insurance Co., and Trans
Pacific Life Insurance Co. and affiliated companies for the
businesses' book value on the closing date plus additional
consideration of up to $4.8 million.
   Primerica estimated that the book value of the businesses,
computed before dividends and other actions that may be taken as
part of the transaction, is about $235 million.
   Primerica said it expects to incur a one-time, after-tax loss of
about $49 million on the transaction, principally due to the
difference between the tax and book bases of the companies
resulting from their tax-free acquisition in 1983.
   The sale of Pennsylvania Life is subject to the approval of the
boards of Primerica and American National, as well as regulatory
approvals. Primerica acquired the businesses to be sold to American
National when it bought Penncorp Financial Inc. in January 1983.
   American National has $4.1 billion in assets and more than $28
billion of life insurance in force.
   Primerica, the former American Can, is engaged in financial
services and specialty retailing.

<HEAD>BankAmerica Adopts Takeover Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp., which bitterly fought
off one hostile takeover bid two years ago and could become a
target again, adopted a takeover defense plan on Monday.
   BankAmerica's board of directors said the preferred share
purchase rights plan was intended to protect shareholders ``in the
event of partial tender offers, squeeze-outs, and other abusive
tactics to gain control of BankAmerica without paying all
stockholders a premium.''
   The plan would make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive
by allowing BankAmerica common shareholders to acquire a new issue
of preferred stock in the event a party acquired 20 percent of the
company's common shares or launched a tender offer to acquire 20
percent or more.
   BankAmerica is the nation's third-largest bank holding company,
following No. 1 Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., both of New
York.
   A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica's chairman, said the plan was not in
reaction to any specific buyout proposal. He noted that hundreds of
other companies had adopted similar plans.
   BankAmerica stock closed down 12{ cents to $11 a share Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   First Interstate Corp., based in Los Angeles, waged a lengthy
and bitter hostile bid for BankAmerica beginning in 1986, but gave
up its chase last year in the face of a major BankAmerica
restructuring that the suitor said diminished the value of its
target.
   ``I don't know why they took this action at this point, except
that maybe the time to do it is when you don't need to,'' Dan B.
Williams of San Francisco-based Sutro & Co. Inc., said of
BankAmerica. ``Maybe they just want to be prepared.''
   Nevertheless, Williams added, if the company did not have
further major problems with its troubled Third World debt portfolio
it might be able to produce a string of profitable performances
that could make it an attractive target.
   Separately, Bank of America announced the formation of three
regional capital markets operations to serve Europe, the Americas
and Asia. Each will be responsible for trading, merchant banking
and investment banking activities in its respective region.
   ``We're reorganizing our operation from product-oriented to
geography-oriented,'' said bank spokesman Jim Mitchell.

   Johnson & Johnson and Playtex
Holdings Inc. have terminated negotiations aimed at selling the
Playtex Family Products business to Johnson & Johnson, the

   In a news release, the companies cited difficulties in

Family Products business, which is a major maker of tampons and
also produces toothbrushes, household gloves and disposable baby
nursers.
   ``The business had a highly successful year in 1987 and is off
to a strong start in 1988,'' Joel F. Smilow, chairman and CEO of
Playtex Holdings, said in the release.
   On Feb. 16, Johnson & Johnson said it had agreed to pay $726
million for Playtex Family Products.
   Industry analysts said at the time that the addition of Playtex
Family Products would give the health care giant more than 30
percent of the U.S. tampon market, of which it already has about 6
percent with the O.B. brand tampon.
   Playtex Family Products is one of three operating subsidiaries
of Stamford, Conn.-based Playtex Holdings, itself once part of BCI
Holdings Inc., the company formed by the April 1986 leveraged
buyout of Beatrice Cos.
   The Family Products Division accounts for half Playtex's sales
and 70 percent of its profits, Smilow said.
   Playtex's other two divisions are Playtex Jhirmack Inc., maker
of hair care products, and Playtex Apparel, a leading worldwide
manufacturer of bras, girdles and pantyhose.
   Proceeds from the sale of the Family Products Division would
have gone towards paying off debt incurred in the December 1986
leveraged buyout of Playtex from BCI, Smilow said when the proposed
deal was announced.
   Smilow said in the release Monday that Playtex Family Products
would continue its efforts to sell the Jhirmack division.

<HEAD>Steelmaker Allowed To Sell Most Of Idled Monessen Mill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. can sell most
of its idled mill in Monessen to Sharon Steel Corp., a federal
bankruptcy judge ruled Monday.
   The $18.1 million deal, approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Warren
Bentz in Erie, is unusual because both companies are reorganizing
under federal bankruptcy laws.
   The deal does not include a $120 million rail mill that is to be
sold in three months by the federal agency that financed and later
foreclosed on it.
   Sharon's offer, which edged out four other bids, was for
Monessen's coke ovens, raw steelmaking facilities and continuous
bloom caster, a piece of equipment that produces semi-finished
products.
   Sharon has until May 15 to complete the purchase, but has
reserved the right to back out of the deal if the Environmental
Protection Agency and Judge Hubert Teitelbaum refuse to grant
temporary relief from pollution control standards imposed on coke
operations at the Westmoreland County mill.
   Attorneys for Wheeling-Pittsburgh and its creditors said Sharon
Steel's offer was best, partly because the steelmaker would provide
a ready market for the coke. They also said Wheeling-Pittsburgh
would be better able to press any financial claims against another
company that was reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law than against one that was not.
   Walter Sieckman, Sharon Steel's chief executive, said his
company's plans to reopen the coke ovens will bring back about 150
jobs. The ovens were idled in June 1986 but kept partially fired to
prevent their brick linings from deteriorating.
   A restart of the operations also would enable Sharon Steel to
recall about 90 to 100 of its own workers who were laid off last
week when a shortfall of coke _ a necessary ingredient in
steelmaking _ caused the company to temporarily idle one of its two
blast furnaces.
   Sharon Steel purchases coke on the open market, but has been
unable to fill its requirements.
