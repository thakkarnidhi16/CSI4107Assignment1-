   Israeli soldiers fired into a crowd of
rock-throwing youngsters at a Gaza Strip girls' school Monday,
killing a 15-year-old Palestinian, according to Arab reports.
   Officials at Shifa Hospital said Asma Abu Obadah of the Shati
refugee camp, died of a bullet wound to the head.
   Leaders of the year-old uprising in the occupied territories
called for a week of strikes to mark Thursday's first anniversary of
the Palestinian rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza.
   They urged Arab nations to ``reconsider their relations'' with
the United States because of its refusal to give Palestine
Liberation Organization chief a visa to address the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Arab reporters quoted witnesses as saying soldiers opened fire
after dozens of students at the Shati Junior High School for Girls
threw stones at them.
   Officials of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in Gaza City, which
oversees aid for Palestinian refugees, confirmed the girl died of a
bullet wound in the head but had no details.
   At least 319 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising and 11
Israelis also have been slain.
   An 8-year-old boy was wounded in the hip and back in
confrontations thazt began in the refugee camp after the girl's
death, said Arab reporters and officials at the Ahli Arab Hospital
said.
   Three other Palestinians, all teen-agers, were reported wounded
in the Gaza Strip.
   About 100 Palestinians demonstrated in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, 15 miles north of Jerusalem. Israel television showed
paratroopers shooting plastic bullets to dispersing the
stone-throwing protesters and chasing youths into nearby houses.
   Also Monday, the army confirmed that Palestinian prisoners held
at the Negev desert Ketziot detention center held a hunger strike
last week. Arab reports said the hunger strike was to protest prison
conditions. More than 2,000 Palestinians are believed to be held at
Ketziot.
   The PLO-backed leaders, in a leaflet marking the anniversary,
called the U.S. decision to bar Arafat a ``decision to silence the
Palestinian voice.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz denied the visa on grounds
Arafat condones terrorism, and the General Assembly voted last
Friday to move its session to Geneva so the PLO leader can speak.
   In the pamphlet, the underground leaders called for strikes this
week to mark the year of rebellion. Earlier, they set a strike for
Tuesday to show solidarity with at least 5,600 Palestinian detainees
in Israeli jails.
   Judith Green, a member of a committee that aids Palestinians in
the West Bank village of Beita, said she witnessed a rampage by
Israeli troops in the village on Nov. 19.
   She told The Associated Press soldiers ``vandalized everything
they passed.''
   ``They used rifle butts to smash windows. They took large stones
from terrace walls and threw them at cars, windows, shutters,
doors,'' she said.
   Ms. Green, a native of Stuttgart, Ark., who has dual U.S.-Israeli
citizenship, said villagers told her later a soldier killed a
12-year-old boy by shooting him in the head at point-blank range.
   The army reported Nov. 23 that a 13-year-old died of a bullet
wound to the head after being a clash with soldiers Nov. 19 in Beita.
   An army spokeswoman said Monday the death still was under
investigation, and refused comment on the charges of a rampage.

<HEAD>Jury Says LILCO Lied To PSC To Get Rate Hikes</HEAD>

   A federal jury Monday awarded Suffolk County
$22.8 million in damages from Long Island Lighting Co., finding that
LILCO and a former executive repeatedly lied to get rate hikes to
help pay for its Shoreham nuclear power plant.
   The verdict, following a two-month trial of the county's civil
racketeering lawsuit against the utility, could make LILCO liable
for $1.8 billion if the trial judge certifies the lawsuit a class
action on behalf of all ratepayers.
   The utility, through its attorney Michael Lesch, issued a
one-sentence statement that said the verdict was ``insupportable''
and that LILCO would seek to set it aside or reverse it on appeal.
   The seven-member jury found that LILCO and a former president,
Wilfred O. Uhl, on three occassions lied to the Public Service
Commission about the completion schedule of Shoreham in order to
obtain rate hikes.
   The jury awarded $7.6 million in damages to the county for what
it overpaid on utility costs because of fraudulently obtained rate
increases in 1978 and 1984, tripled to $22.8 million under the
racketeering statue.
   The county had sought up to $72 million in damages.
   The jury rejected the county's charges that LILCO deceived the
PSC in obtaining other rate increases in 1975, 1976, 1979 and 1981.
   It also found no violations by three other former LILCO officials
who were defendants.
   ``I think the jury spoke loud and clearly that LILCO had been
engaging in a pattern of fraud for a decade,'' said Kenneth
McCallion, who was the county's lead attorney during the two-month
trial.
   Last week in Albany, the state Legislature let pass by a deadline
for approving a plan that would keep Shoreham closed and give LILCO
5 percent annual rate hikes over the next decade.
   LILCO has said that while the plan could be revived, it would
proceed toward licensing the plant.
   Suffolk County Executive Patrick Halpin called the verdict ``a
great victory for the county and Suffolk's ratepayers.''
   According to testimony at the trial, the Shoreham plant, which is
located 55 miles east of Manhattan, had originally been scheduled to
be in operation in 1978 at a cost of $77 million. Construction was
completed in 1985, but the plant was never opened because of public
opposition.
   The county alleged that LILCO spent $8 billion in the
construction of Shoreham, but LILCO says the plant cost $5.3 billion.
   Originally, the county had wanted to make the suit a class action
on behalf of all LILCO customers, but U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein limited the scope of the suit before the trial started.
   After the verdict, Weinstein said he would now accept a motion
asking him to certify the class and indicated that if he granted the
request, LILCO could be liable for up to $1.8 billion.
   ``This will have a significant impact on the financial health of
LILCO,'' Weinstein said.
   Lesch, the LILCO attorney, answered, ``It certainly will.''
   One of the jurors, Norma Spagna of Queens, said the jurors had
not believed Uhl, who was one of 21 witnesses who testified for
LILCO.
   ``I think he lied on the stand,'' said Spagna.
   Uhl, who was president of LILCO from 1978 to 1984, had denied
that he lied to state officials about when the construction of
Shoreham would be completed.

<TEXT>
   When it gave birth to Western civilization,
the Mediterranean was the world. Ecologists today are calling it a
``Paradise Lost.''
   Ravaged by man over the centuries, the face of the Mediterranean
has been scarred _ lush forests felled, wildlife silenced,
mineral-rich soil long gone, aquamarine currents fouled by oil
slicks.
   But some of the region's leading thinkers are trying to
rediscover a ``Mediterranean identity'' through the only common bond
they can find: a determination to save what's left of the
Mediterranean's environment.
   It's a region ``whose contribution is acknowledged by the world,
but whose future lies in doubt,'' wrote Serge Antoine, international
relations adviser for France's Environment Ministry.
   Antoine, among 60 delegates who discussed the state of the
Mediterranean at a recent international conference in Cairo
sponsored by the Rome-based Aspen Institute Italia, called on the
region's 18 countries to unite their cultural and political wills to
shape a brighter future.
   The institute, a branch of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic
Studies of Aspen, Colo., brings together political, economic and
cultural leaders to discuss current issues.
   A clear message emerged from the conference: the only way to
solve environmental, social, economic and political ills of the area
is to find common ground uniting the diverse cultures tied by
geography to the Mediterranean Sea.
   ``There's only one issue that can join us now, and that's the
environment,'' Gianni De Michelis, Italy's deputy prime minister and
president of the Italian institute, said in an interview.
   ``Despite the vast differences between industrialized countries
that border the northern Mediterranean and less-developed countries
bordering the south, everybody agrees we have to do something about
the environment. It's the only rallying point we have, the one issue
public opinion can use to force politicians to act.''
   Delegates from Europe, North Africa and the United States said
the Mediterranean region has greater potential for environmental
progress than most because of its manageable size and historical
links its countries share.
   They agreed, however, that despite the work of numerous local and
international agencies, governments aren't doing enough.
   A major topic of the conference was the Mediterranean Action
Plan, a survey dating from the mid-1970s seeking to balance the
area's environmental and development needs through the first quarter
of the 21st century.
   The Mediterranean basin is among the most developed regions in
the world despite its varied cultures, but its population and
industry are shifting rapidly toward its fragile coastlines. Tourism
is increasing greatly throughout the region, and almost half the
millions of annual tourists remain along the coast.
   The basin has 29,000 miles of seacoast, only 40 percent of which
is flat, usable land.
   Additionally, population is growing unevenly, declining slightly
along the Mediterranean's richer northern tier and expanding rapidly
in the poorer south.
   Experts warned of threats from other sources: ships dumping toxic
or hazardous wastes, deforestation on both sides of the
Mediterranean and the lack of effort to find alternatives to
fossil-based fuels that pollute the atmosphere.
   One proposal to spur Mediterranean recovery, suggested by Atef M.
Ebeid, Egypt's minister of Cabinet affairs, calls for the setting up
of a ``green belt'' along the entire Mediterranean.
   But U.S. delegate Peter Thacher of Washington's World Resources
Institute, while praising the virtues of the concept, cautioned that
national politics can and often do override environmental
considerations.
   He said the only way to achieve necessary international
cooperation for a project of the scale of the ``green belt''
proposal would be under the flag of the United Nations.
   Whatever is done, delegates to the conference agreed that the
need to do something is acute.

   Passengers angered by two days of flight delays
staged an eight-hour sit-in inside a jetliner of China's
trouble-plagued national airlines, an official newspaper reported
today.
   The China Daily said 120 Chinese passengers refused to get off a
plane scheduled to fly from Beijing's Capital Airport to the
southwestern city of Chungking after being told just before takeoff
of another delay due to fog in Chungking.
   The ``chaotic scenes'' at the airport on Sunday came several days
after Hu Yizhou, director-general of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), the state-run airlines, told an
emergency meeting ``effective measures'' were being taken to improve
the airlines' poor service record.
   The meeting was held because of rising complaints from Chinese
and foreign passengers about CAAC service, notably frequent flight
delays, overbooking, refusal to provide information about flights
and indifferent in-flight service.
   The daily said the flight to Chungking originally scheduled for
Saturday was canceled because of fog in the Sichuan province city
and ticket holders had been put in an airport hostel with no heat or
electricity.
   The flight was rescheduled for Sunday, and the plane had taxied
to the runway for takeoff when it was decided that Chungking was
still too foggy for a landing. A few Chinese and foreign passengers
left the plane when it returned to the terminal, but 120 Chinese
passengers refused.
   Airport officials denied a report in the Beijing Evening News on
Monday that they were rude to the passengers and cut off the plane's
electricity and heating systems when the passengers refused to
disembark.
   Officials said they decided to use the same Boeing 737 for a
flight Sunday to the Sichuan provincial capital of Chengdu, but that
flight too was canceled because of the sit-in.
   Airport official Zhang Zuochang said today that the Chungking
airport remained closed by heavy fog. He said some of the protesters
had given up and returned their tickets, while others took a Monday
flight to Chengdu, 170 from Chungking.

   Here are brief profiles of some of the
people involved in PTL for the last year and a half:
   
   JIM BAKKER:
   Founded PTL in 1973-74, and acted as ministry leader and chief
personality on internationally televised show. He and his wife,
Tammy, and his top aides received about $14.6 million in salary and
compensation, according to the IRS, from mid-1984 to March 1987.
   That month, Bakker admitted to sexual relations with former New
York church secretary Jessica Hahn and trying to buy her silence
with $363,000. Later he was sued by the ministry for $52 million for
allegedly using PTL funds to feed an extravagant lifestyle, and
mismanaging the ministry into ruin. Offered $172 million proposal to
buy back PTL in fall 1988, but failed to come up with a $3 million
downpayment. Has started new ministry near Charlotte, N.C.
   
   TAMMY BAKKER:
   Bakker's wife, and co-host of the once-lucrative PTL television
show. Produced numerous religious recordings and became noted for
her extravagant makeup. Also received hundreds of thousands of
dollars in salary and other compensation. Also involved in
ministry's suit and grand jury investigation.
   
   RICHARD DORTCH:
   Former PTL president and Bakker's top aide, handled the money for
Jessica Hahn once she agreed to recant her accusations that she and
Bakker had a sexual encounter in a Florida hotel room in 1980.
Defrocked by the Assemblies of God. Resigned from PTL April 28,
1987, and moved to Safety Harbor, Fla. Sued PTL for $893,000 for
salary and benefits and a North Carolina parsonage. Dortch said he
had a five-year employment contract and was terminated 17 months
early, on July 21, by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. The IRS said Dortch
was paid $1.2 million, an excess compensation of $754,000.
   
   JERRY FALWELL:
   Moral Majority founder and pastor of the Old Time Gospel Hour in
Virginia. Stepped in to lead PTL for six months, ending in October
1987, after Bakker left the ministry. As of end of November 1988,
contributions to his Gospel Hour in Lynchburg, Va., had dropped more
than $10 million, with the ministry's net worth falling by nearly $5
million from 1987.
   
   JESSICA HAHN:
   Former New York church secretary who engaged in a sexual
encounter with Bakker, accepted some $363,000 in hush money, but
later paid back most of the money. Lived in the Playboy Mansion in
Los Angeles and story about her affair with Bakker, along with
bare-breasted photos, was published in Playboy. Later took a job as
a radio announcer in Arizona.
   
   ROY GRUTMAN:
   Served as PTL attorney from March 19, 1987, when Falwell took
over, to Oct. 6, when Falwell resigned. Bakker sued Grutman in March
1988 for $10,000 for conflict of interest. Bakker said Grutman
tricked him into resigning and turning the ministry over to Falwell;
the Bakkers claim they did not know Grutman also represented Falwell
at the time. Bakker said Grutman and Falwell had told him the
ministry was in danger of being taken over by another evangelist,
Jimmy Swaggart. The Bakkers say Grutman advised them to allow
Falwell to run PTL until it was safe for them to return. Grutman
maintains he was never retained by Bakker. The lawsuit was dropped
when Grutman left PTL.
   
   SAM JOHNSON:
   The only original PTL minister left and the pastor of Heritage
Ministries, non-profit off-shoot ministry from bankruptcy division
of assets and non-profit activities. Testified before a federal
grand jury that he didn't know where he got $10,000 he gave to
Dortch, which allegedly went to pay Ms. Hahn. In November began
drive for PTL's Lifetime Partners, or major contributors, to raise
enough money to buy back Heritage USA, the Christian theme park, and
the rest of PTL's assets, including a television satellite network
and hundreds of acres of land.
   
   ROE MESSNER:
   A Kansas construction contractor who built most of the Christian
retreat at Heritage USA and who, next to the Internal Revenue
Service, is the largest single creditor in the PTL bankruptcy
proceeding. His firm had $41 million construction underway when
Bakker resigned, and Messner said PTL was $14.9 million behind in
payments. PTL sued Messner Enterprises and Commercial Builders filed
a counterclaim saying Messner did shoddy work and won contracts
without competitive bidding. PTL officials said Messner was entitled
only to the $17 million he received for projects including the
Heritage Towers Hotel, which was never finished.
   
   DAVID TAGGART:
   PTL vice president and close Bakker aide who handled travel
arrangements, purchases, managed personal finances. Also named in
$52 million mismanagement suit by PTL. Filed suit against PTL for
$187,000 in lost wages, citing an employment contract entitling him
to $150,000 a year plus a Christmas bonus. The IRS said Taggart got
$2.7 million from 1984 to 1987 _ $2.26 million more than he was
worth.

   The Philippine military admits that thousands of
villages are heavily influenced by communist rebels. Associated
Press reporter Yasmin Arquiza visited one such village, and here is
her report.
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>IN THE CORDILLERA MOUNTAINS, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With its huts
scattered along steep slopes, the village looks no different from
hundreds of others in the rugged Cordillera range. But here, village
elders owe their allegiance to communist rebels.
   Residents say they began cooperating with the New People's Army
to fill a void created by the lack of services from the central
government in Manila, about 200 miles to the south.
   Members of the village council granted an interview to The
Associated Press on condition that the name of the settlement not be
published to avoid military reprisal.
   The village, in Kalinga-Apayo province, is near the town of
Balbalan and is among 10 in the area which is virtually controlled
by the New People's Army. The military admits that up to 20 percent
of the 40,000 villages nationwide are ``influenced'' by the
insurgents.
   In this village and several others nearby, rebel influence
amounts to virtual control.
   Experiences of the villagers offer insights into why the
insurgency persists despite the 1986 ouster of President Ferdinand
Marcos and the rise of a democratic administration under Corazon
Aquino.
   The 34-year-old village leader, who would not give his name,
traced the origin of the rebel government to a lack of confidence in
the Marcos administration.
   He said villagers, whose main contact with the central government
is an occasional military patrol, remain unconvinced that the new
administration in Manila is significantly different from the old.
   ``We had no trust in our elected officials and we could not work
in the fields due to intense militarization,'' said the leader. ``We
wanted to find out the best way to solve these problems.''
   Communist guerrillas began operating in the Cordillera Mountains
of northern Luzon in the early 1970s but arrived in this village
only in 1982, more than three years before Marcos was ousted.
   The rebels conducted political seminars, taught villagers to read
and write, and then established camps nearby. They improved living
conditions by running off thieves and campaigning against alcohol
and gambling, all of which had flourished due to inadequate police
protection.
   Those who did not want to cooperate with the rebels were warned
to leave. On Nov. 14, 1987, the rebels' de facto control was
formalized when residents nominated and elected a rival village
council which works with the local insurgent commander.
   The ``rebel'' village council operates in tandem with the
government's seven-member local committee. In some cases, residents
serve openly on the government council and secretly on the rebel
panel.
   The village leader said the presence of rebel sympathizers on the
official town council enables the underground committee to control
and monitor funds earmarked for the area by provincial and national
governments.
   ``The mayor is reduced to a figurehead,'' said a local New
People's Army leader, who gave his name only as ``Ka (Comrade)
Dangkas.''
   The village leader boasted that the underground administration
has been more successful in implementing development projects. He
recalled that in 1979, local officials of Marcos' New Society
Movement party wasted so much money in constructing a school that
there was not enough cash left to build a floor.
   By contrast, the village leader said, the rebel council has
encouraged residents to plant vegetables to reduce their economic
dependence on coffee production.
   Residents say they have accepted the authority of the shadow
government because its members were chosen freely by secret ballot.
Members of the official council are largely holdovers from the
Marcos administration.
   The Aquino government plans to hold its first village election
next March.
   Still, the rebels' hold on the village faces threats from the
military and the rival Cordillera People's Liberation Army, which
broke with the New People's Army in 1986 and cooperates with the
government.
   A few months ago, the rival rebels killed a village council
member and another civilian in a nearby municipality because they
were suspected of aiding the communists, the village leader said.
   He also said the rebels has tried to flush out communist
supporters in his village.
   ``Everybody knows who we are,'' the village leader said of rebel
supporters. But so far, he said, villagers have refused to expose
them.

   When President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meets Cuban
leader Fidel Castro later this week, Soviet experts expect him to
try to persuade the veteran revolutionary that it's past time for
Castro to draw in his horns.
   ``We are not going to worsen our relations with Cuba,'' said one
Latin American specialist. ``But Gorbachev is a very persuasive man,
and he will try to explain his intentions.''
   The trip to Cuba to mark the 30th anniversary of the revolution
that brought Castro to power has been in the planning stages at
least since last June.
   But it assumed a flavor more palatable to Washington two weeks
ago, when Gorbachev disclosed the visit would be sandwiched between
a trip to New York to address the United Nations and meet with
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush and a stop in
Britain for talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and a
meeting with Queen Elizabeth II.
   The Soviet expert, who agreed to discuss Soviet-Cuban relations
on condition he not be identified, said Castro's regime has become
not only a financial burden at a time when the Kremlin is trying to
divert resources to its domestic needs but a foreign policy
liability as well.
   The source predicted Gorbachev would use his trip to Havana to
offer encouragement to the Contadora nations trying to hammer out a
regional peace settlement in Central America. And he is expected to
seek support from Castro, who has been openly hostile to the Soviet
leader's efforts to encourage individual initiative by enabling
enterprises to make profits, start private cooperatives.
   Nor has Castro been sympathetic to the Soviet president's
policies encouraging greater openness of expression and a more
competitive system of electing party and government officials.
   Gorbachev's ``new political thinking'' emphasizes his recognition
that the Soviet Union, in order to concentrate on improving the lot
of its own people, must disengage from regional trouble spots around
the world and try to convince the West that Moscow no longer poses a
threat to world security.
   ``The Cuban government does not accept the shift in our policy,''
the analyst said. ``They are displeased with the way we are trying
to reconsider our history. It upsets our relations with
revolutionary countries.''
   And Castro is among the few die-hard revolutionaries still in
power. He has continued, both Soviets and Western authorities say,
to export revolution, pumping aid to the Sandinista regime in
Nicaragua, sending troops to aid the Marxist regime in Angola and
encouraging guerrilla wars elsewhere in the Third World.
   A fundamental shift in Communist ideology, as interpreted by
Moscow, has left Castro out on a limb.
   ``We are now saying human values take precedence over class
values,'' the Soviet expert said. ``We are no longer supporting
class wars or socialist revolutions in Latin America. We are not
against class struggle, but we are saying it should not dominate
international relations. We are not going to get involved.''
   Asked if revolutionaries trying to seize power in Latin America
and elsewhere wouldn't feel betrayed by such a policy, the source
said, ``We're not betraying their interests. There's just no way for
them to succeed.
   ``Latin America is being integrated into the capitalist system.
Communists may take part in the democratic process, but they should
not try to fight for power.''
   The source acknowledged Gorbachev was not likely to be that
specific while in Cuba as Castro's guest.
   ``But the message is that we are standing on the firm ground of
`new political thinking,' and we are not going to get involved in
Latin America,'' he said. ``Beneath the rhetoric will lie the
thought that if Cuba tries to do otherwise, it does so alone.''

   No one told Richard Green it would be easy when
he took over in March as chancellor of the nation's biggest school
system.
   In rapid succession, Green's school system, with nearly 1 million
students, has had to contend with allegations of drug use, political
and sexual payoffs, theft of school property and other abuses by
educators and administrators.
   A principal was charged with buying crack on a Harlem street;
school officials are alleged to have used cocaine at meetings; a
high school student brought a semiautomatic weapon to class; a
school board member was alleged to have kept a baby grand piano
belonging to the school in his home, and a school aide claimed she
was transferred against her will after she rejected a board member's
offer to ``go skinny-dipping and make beautiful music together.''
   Those allegations come on top of the system's entrenched
problems: uncooperative legislators, high dropout rates, drug use,
crumbling buildings, disgruntled employees and abandonment of the
schools by middle-class white students.
   Then there are such horror stories as elementary classes forced
to meet in bathrooms because of a lack of classroom space and high
school students relying on 30-year-old textbooks.
   Here on the toughest turf in American education, Green, 52, has
responded much as he did during his seven years as school
superintendent in Minneapolis, with an approach that is low-key and
methodical and a style that is blunt and acerbic.
   Green has resisted easy answers to difficult problems, has
reacted sharply to those who have criticized him for not moving fast
enough, and has resolutely refused to blow his own horn.
   But he did step in and suspend the board of one district in the
Bronx after an investigation turned up evidence of patronage,
extortion and misuse of public money.
   During a TV interview broadcast Sunday, Green said he would not
hesitate to suspend other boards if a report due Monday from the
central Board of Education's inspector general indicated widespread
corruption in a district.
   Asked in August what he considered his greatest accomplishments,
he replied, ``None. I haven't accomplished anything. I've come to
set the stage for making education work.''
   While critics have wondered when the play would begin, Green has
been busy behind the scenes, tinkering with the bureaucracy, moving
to tighten discipline in the schools, and negotiating with the
Legislature for greater power over principals and the community
school boards that runs the city's elementary and middle schools.
   Green, who is paid $150,000 a year, became the first black
chancellor of New York City's school system after a bitter selection
process that pitted him the favorite of the teachers' union.
   Green was the favorite of Mayor Edward Koch and School Board
President Robert F. Wagner Jr. At Green's swearing-in, Koch promised
Green that the mayor and other local officials would be nothing more
than ``soldiers in your army.''
   But Koch is nobody's soldier, as became clear recently when Green
urged compassion instead of condemnation of the principal charged
with buying crack.
   Koch and Wagner angrily said Green should have made an example of
the principal. Green ultimately reversed his stand.
   Speaking of Koch and Wagner, he said, ``I certainly do
acknowledge that their perceptions on how to market issues in the
city may be more advanced than mine.''
   In fact, Green has shown an unwillingness to ``market issues'' in
the nation's mass media capital and has kept a low profile for most
of his tenure.
   Critics say he has missed an opportunity to capture the public's
interest and focus attention on the schools.
   ``Anybody with any brains will know you're not going to turn the
schools around in a day,'' said School Board member Edward Sadowsky,
``but the public requires and has a right to require some signs that
something is happening.''
   Lately, things have been happening _ but they haven't been good.
   Prosecutors are said to be investigating the shooting death of a
Harlem school board employee. The man died in April, reportedly just
before he was to testify before a grand jury investigating
allegations of corruption against the board.
   Bronx District Attorney Paul Gentile said his investigators were
looking into charges that Bronx school board members demanded sex in
exchange for jobs or promotions.
   Green said in a recent TV interview that those who would write
his political obituary now are ``very premature.''
   ``I believe even those that have judged me will someday find
things that we are doing that they can be proud of,'' he said. ``And
I don't ask them to have patience; I ask them to simply keep your
eye on the prize, and that's the children of the city, and expect
the chancellor will be the No. 1 cheerleader for them.''

<HEAD>In Strike-Bound Palermo, `It's Forbidden to Be Born or to Die'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A two-week-old strike by city employees of
Palermo has left the morgue full, newborns unable to leave the
hospital and traffic more hopeless than ever.
   ``Agony of Palermo: Here it's forbidden to be born or to die,''
read the headline on the front-page Sunday of La Repubblica, a
nationwide daily.
   Among the striking city employees were gravediggers, traffic
police, school janitors and clerks in the office that gives out
birth certificates.
   Italian news accounts said bodies in coffins were being stacked
in the morgue during the strike.
   The Palermo correspondent of Il Giornale, a Milan newspaper,
reported that one day last week police had to be called to break up
an angry crowd of fathers who wanted to register the births of their
new sons and daughters but who found the office barred because the
clerks were striking.
   The birth certificate problem is more than one for the records
because Italian law forbids the discharge of a newborn from a
hospital without one, La Repubblica noted.
   With garbage piling up and bathrooms uncleaned, schools have been
forced to close.
   The strike centered over how to distribute back pay tied to
seniority, which must be awarded according to a recently made
contract. A court ruled the payments should come in installments
over a 24-month period, but employees want it paid over a 12-month
period.
   To protest the stalemate, six union officials chained themselves
to each other and were refusing to budge from two sofas in the
waiting room just outside Mayor Leoluca Orlando's office in city
hall.
   The unionists on Friday began a liquid-only fast and vowed to
stick it out until the workers get their way.
   The mayor has pointed out that it might take some time for a
settlement. The city council on Saturday night approved the
12-installment plan, but Orlando was quoted as saying the scheme
needs the approval of a provincial control commission that is not
scheduled to meet for several weeks.

   A 17-year-old died after plunging at
least 130 feet from the top of the New Haven Veterans Memorial
Coliseum, where he had planned to attend a rock concert, authorities
said.
   Steven Frank Piech of Danbury was on the top level of the parking
garage above the coliseum when he slipped, held on for a moment and
then fell to the sidewalk, witnesses told police.
   One witness, Tom Corso, flagged down a police officer, and
another witness called for medical help on his truck radio,
authorities said Sunday.
   ``We couldn't believe what happened,'' Corso said.
   Piech had arrived early for Saturday night's concert by Ozzy
Osbourne and Anthrax when he fell, authorities said.

<HEAD>Chicken Pox Keeps Mick Jones Off The Road</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A case of chicken pox made Mick Jones cancel this
fall's ``Big Audio Dynamite'' tour. But Jones vows to come back.
   ``Tighten Up Vol. 88'' is the band's latest album and ``Just Play
Music,'' the first single, is receiving radio play in the United
States.
   With the group planning to resume touring after the new year,
Jones is anxious to regain its previous momentum.
   ``I think it's a growing thing, a matter of getting people to
listen, changing the way they think. I just want to communicate and
play music,'' said the 33-year-old guitarist and songwriter, who
recovered sufficiently to give a recent interview in midtown
Manhattan.
   ``I was getting into the mood where the group was unstoppable,''
he said, before canceling the tour.
   ``We were ravaged by the critics, but the music wasn't for them.
It was for more _ it was music with a reason, with something to say.
You can put us on page 13 of your paper, but you can't ignore us
because the other stuff is going to whither and die.''
   That touch of drama should be no surprise coming from Jones, who
help lead the British punk movement with the Clash a decade ago.
   Jones was born in London in 1955. A fan of such groups as the
Animals and the Kinks, he considered rock 'n' roll ``the most
exciting thing around.'' But in the 1970s, he and many other fans
grew disillusioned with the direction of rock. Punk groups began to
appear as a response to the complacency and indifference of
mainstream rock and society in general.
   Like the Sex Pistols, the Clash were crude, loud, angry and
threatening. In short everything they thought rock 'n' roll should
be. ``It needed to happen,'' said Jones. ``We needed it at that
time.''
   Punk wasn't simply a kind of music, it was an attitude. Jones,
like many who grew up in England in the '60s and '70s, felt that the
more established rock bands had turned their backs on the fans.
   ``The music's just as much about the fans,'' he said. ``They're
very important. They don't want go to the show and just have their
wallet emptied. They've got T-shirts, but they're not anywhere. You
need to take it to the next place.''
   Jones and bassist Paul Simonon were in the punk group London SS
before forming the Clash in 1976 with singer-guitarist Joe Strummer,
previously a member of the 101ers.
   ``At the time I was just expressing myself the only way I
could,'' Jones said. ``We looked at it as if we had a foot in the
door and we were going to go in that door. There has never been
anything like it since.''
   Their self-titled debut album came out in 1977 and contained some
of the most ferocious music ever recorded. As one reviewer noted, it
was music that ``never stops snarling. It's always threatening to
blow up in your face.''
   Jones, who ironically once worked as an inspector of suspected
letter bombs, readily agreed with that assessment.
   ``It was quite a rush,'' he said. ``It sounded beautiful to us.
Music should explode, it shouldn't be contained and well behaved and
do what it's told.''
   Although the Clash went on to record classic albums such as
``Give `Em Enough Rope'' and ``London Calling,'' the members of the
band started feuding and by 1984, the group had broken up.
   ``In the end, we ended up writing our own things and sort of
handing them over. It wasn't as much fun.''
   So Jones decided to start fresh. He wasn't interested in forming
a ``Mick Jones Project''; he wanted prospective bandmates to think
of themselves as equals.
   ```Ideas' was the main word. I wanted to have people with good
ideas and fresh ideas,'' he said. ``I was a good enough musician by
that time. I looked for people who had personality. I didn't want it
to just be me.''
   But Jones couldn't deny who would emerge as the band's leader.
   ``It's a dictatorship,'' he said, smiling, ``but a benevolent
dictatorahip. I wanted to make it a more democratic thing. I try and
listen to the others.''
   Jones pieced together a new group, starting with his friend and
ex-Clash video director Don Letts (credited with ``FX and Vocals'').
He added bassist Leo ``E-Zee Kill'' Williams. Drummer Greg Roberts
was hired through a newspaper ad, and Jones then brought in
keyboardist Dan Donovan who originally came to photograph the band.
   The group was named Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.), and drew on a
variety of musical styles, notably reggae. The first record, ``This
Is Big Audio Dynamite,'' was released in 1985, and eventually went
gold in Britain.
   Strummer briefly reunited with Jones to co-write and co-produce
B.A.D.'s next record, ``No. 10 Upping Street,'' with its hit single,
``Badrock City.''

   James Brown sang to about 400 people Sunday
during a ``Wrestle-Rock '88'' concert and wrestling show staged in
part to fufill terms of his probation from South Carolina.
   Brown's spokesmen had said prior to the concert that it was
costing the singer, known as ``The Godfather of Soul,'' about
$40,000 to stage the event.
   Appearing at a charity event was a condition of the probation
Brown received in May. He had pleaded guilty to charges of carrying
a pistol and resisting arrest and pleading no contest to a charge of
possession of the hallucinogen PCP near his home in Beech Island,
S.C.
   Tickets were $10. On Thursday, officials at the Augusta-Richmond
Civic Center said just 41 tickets had been sold; it could not be
immediately determined Sunday night how many of the estimated 400 in
the audience had bought tickets and how many were guests.
   The civic center can seat up to 7,500 people for such a concert.
   ``The thought was the message,'' Brown said Sunday. ``The turnout
didn't bother me.''
   But he added that if he ever did another benefit show, he would
concentrate more on being ``advertised, not criticized.''
   Proceeds from the benefit were to go to the Aiken, S.C.,
Fraternal Order of Police, a society that helps abused children, and
leukemia research.

<HEAD>West Germans Trust Soviet Reforms, See Less Need for Defense
Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new poll indicates that support among
West Germans for military readiness has sunk to its lowest level in
26 years, with three out of four discounting the Soviet bloc as a
serious security threat.
   The survey, published Sunday in the conservative Hamburg weekly
Welt am Sonntag, also indicated that West Germans tend to believe
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he talks about reducing
East-West tension.
   The paper said officials in the Defense Ministry, which it said
commissioned the survey, were shocked by the findings. West Germany,
located at the front lines of the East-West struggle, traditionally
has been one of NATO's strongest supporters.
   The poll results reflect a growing sense among West Germans _
especially younger people _ that the government should be focusing
more on domestic problems such as unemployment.
   West Germans have become increasingly critical in recent months
about the presence of Allied troops, tanks and low-flying aircraft
in their densely populated country. There are 400,000 foreign troops
stationed here.
   The Bonn government last week announced it plans to cut its own
training maneuvers by 50 percent beginning in 1990.
   Welt am Sonntag did not explain how it obtained the results of
the survey. The newspaper, known to have good connections with the
government, did not say how many people were questioned, how the
survey was conducted, how the firm chose respondents. Nor did it
give a margin for error.
   It said the poll was conducted by the Emnid Market, Opinion and
Social Research firm based in the northern city of Bielefeld. The
Associated Press telephoned the polling firm, but there was no
answer Sunday.
   On the question of whether the East bloc poses a military threat
to the West, 75 percent of those questioned chose the response that
``this is not to be taken seriously,'' Welt am Sonntag reported.
   In a 1984 Emnid survey, just 47 percent said they saw no serious
threat from their communist European neighbors.
   About 51 percent of those questioned this time said the
government spends too much on defense, the newspaper said.
   Given a list of 17 social concerns to rank by order of
importance, the ``defense of the federal republic from external
threats'' was designated last.
   The newspaper said that response indicated the lowest level of
defense-readiness concern among West Germans in the 26 years the
firm has been conducting such polls.
   Ranked first in importance for the government was the protection
and creation of jobs, and better protection of the environment was
the second most important issue, according to the poll respondents.
   A summer poll indicated 71 percent of West Germans have a
``favorable'' opinion of Gorbachev, compared with a favorable rating
of only 41 percent for President Reagan.
   According to the poll results made public Sunday, 82 percent said
they considered the Soviet Union ``to be serious about a policy of
reducing tensions.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Apt to Take Cautious Stance Toward Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush has taken a somewhat cautious
approach toward the Soviet Union that lacks the visceral distaste
that Ronald Reagan had for the ``evil empire'' at the outset of his
presidency.
   Together, the incoming and outgoing U.S. presidents will sit down
for lunch with the Soviet leader in New York on Wednesday and
solicit a commitment from him to maintain a four-part agenda for
superpower dialogue that gives high priority to human rights and
arms control.
   Still, Bush said recently that he would not try to put his own
spin on the session. ``In terms of specificity, in terms of my
committing a brand new administration to specifics in arms control
or anything else, I'm not going to do that,'' he said.
   His general approach to Moscow and the innovative Gorbachev is
one of caution.
   ``Remember, the Cold War is not over,'' Bush told a San Francisco
audience last July.
   ``The leadership of the Soviet Union is changing ... but old
ambitions die hard,'' he said in October. ``Systems die hard. ...
The leaves may be falling, but the trees are fundamentally the same.
As much as we welcome the change in the Soviet Union, now is not the
time to abandon realism about what makes the Soviet Union move.''
   Bush was on the campaign trail then. Presidents have a habit of
changing their rhetoric as well as their policies once in office.
   Bush, who prides himself on his foreign policy experience, has
traveled to 72 countries and been U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations and to China, and director of the Central Intelligence
Agency. Those jobs _ and the vice presidency _ give Bush some
insights into how the Soviets operate.
   How much a role he played in the Reagan administration's gradual
shift from hostility toward reconciliation remains an open question.
His own record and statements indicate a generally
middle-of-the-road stance.
   At least one point seems clear. Bush, like Reagan, is heartily in
favor of a further U.S. military buildup. ``Those who want to
abandon the policy of peace through strength in the hopes of
self-induced Soviet restraint are dead wrong,'' he said in October.
   The question is whether Bush will have to give ground while
trying to cope with the U.S. deficit and other economic problems.
   Former Sen. John Tower, considered the front-runner for defense
secretary in the Bush administration, championed Reagan's defense
buildup in Congress. Brent Scowcroft, Bush's choice for national
security adviser, has suggested cuts of at least $300 billion from
the Reagan administration's military spending plan for 1990-1994.
   How Bush will deal with the deficit and military buildup still is
uncertain.
   Scowcroft, who was national security adviser to President Ford,
is an experienced strategist who is inclined to move slowly in
working out arms control agreements with Moscow.
   On the other hand, Bush's choice for secretary of state, James A.
Baker III, has little experience in foreign policy and has never
been to the Soviet Union. Like Bush he has a reputation for being a
conservative but not particularly ideological.
   Still on the negotiating table as Bush prepares to take office is
a prospective treaty to reduce the two powers' armories of
globe-girdling missiles, bombers and submarines by 30 to 50 percent.
   Also on Bush's agenda: chemical and conventional weapons.
   Bush voted twice in 1983 to break Senate ties on bills
authorizing development of new chemical weapons. In the campaign,
however, he called for a ban and claimed that it was ``my issue''
since he took a draft treaty banning such weapons to the Geneva
disarmament conference in 1984.
   On the campaign trail, Bush also advocated cuts in non-nuclear
forces in Europe. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact are poised to begin negotiations _ provided
Washington can resolve its differences with France over the role of
neutral nations and with Moscow over human rights.
   On Reagan's prized Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known
as Star Wars, Bush pledged to ``research and deploy a missile
defense system, as soon as it's practical.''
   The hooker is ``practical.'' Many of the program's critics doubt
it will ever be sufficiently airtight to justify the enormous cost
of going ahead.

   The memories of the Soviet surprise at
Reykjavik, Iceland, two years ago are still fresh in the minds of
U.S. officials as they prepare for Wednesday's meeting between
President Reagan, George Bush and Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   U.S. officials, by playing down expectations for the meeting and
claiming it is ``not a summit in the traditional sense,'' echo
similar assertions made two years ago prior to the so-called
``mini-summit'' held in Reykjavik.
   ``Everyone agrees that the most important reason for this meeting
is to review where the relationship between the two countries is, to
reflect on the historical strides that we have made in our
relationship,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after
the New York meeting was announced.
   But Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, Reagan's national security adviser,
said Friday that the U.S. side will be ready if Gorbachev springs
anything.
   ``I think we would be prepared to deal with any surprise that
they might come up with, take it under advisement, without feeling
that we're under any pressure during a ... 2{-hour lunch period, to
necessarily respond in a substantive way to something that has not
been anticipated,'' he said.
   The Icelandic summit was touted as a brief session, with the goal
of making advances in the arms control arena that would pave the way
for a full-fledged summit later in the year on U.S. soil.
   True, no noses were bloodied, but Reagan and Gorbachev parted
company at the windswept Hofdi House amid bitter looks and even
harsher language, having wrestled with the earthshaking question of
ridding the world of the superpower nuclear arsenals.
   Gorbachev caught the U.S. side off guard by proposing a global
ban on intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the so-called
non-summit disintegrated when Reagan refused to budge over proposed
curbs on his Star Wars missile defense system.
   In Reykjavik's wake, charges flew that Reagan and his U.S. team
had been woefully unprepared to deal with the stunning arms control
proposals hurled about by Gorbachev. The White House scurried to
recoup, with then-chief of staff Donald T. Regan rejecting the idea
that the parley had been a disappointment, claiming instead that it
gave the two leaders a deeper understanding of one another and
narrowed differences over offensive arms.
   Yet it took months for the superpower relationship to get back on
a more productive track, leading to the extensive summits in
Washington and Moscow and the first-ever treaty banning an entire
class of nuclear weapons.
   Even though the New York session has been as hastily arranged as
Reykjavik, and even though it is also being held with the intent of
making sure the U.S.-Soviet relationship remains stable, few
independent Soviet and arms control analysts expect a replay of the
surprises that sprouted in Iceland.
   ``It will not be Reykjavik,'' predicted Lt. Gen. William Odom,
who has recently retired as the head of the National Security
Agency. ``I expect it to be a fairly low-key, transitional summit,
with both parties seeking to maintain the present level of
relations.''
   Odom, now a director of national security issues for the
Indianapolis-based Hudson Institute, said neither side wants a
``jolt in relations'' as a new administration takes over and as
Gorbachev struggles with economic and political turmoil at home.
   ``An even-keel relationship will be very useful for Mr. Bush, and
even more useful for Gorbachev,'' Odom said.
   Alice Young, coordinator of the Soviet studies program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said
she did not expect Gorbachev to spring any surprises on Bush and
Reagan because the Soviet leader ``has his own agenda.''
   ``He's seeking to solidify the U.S.-Soviet relationship. He has
shown himself to be a very impressive leader, Bush has met him
before, and Bush can hold his own against Gorbachev,'' she said.
   Ms. Young did not entirely discount the chance that Gorbachev
might renew his Reykjavik attempts at one-upmanship.
   ``Just because he's done it once, doesn't mean he won't do it
again,'' she said, although she added that since Gorbachev has made
his mark as ``a world-class leader'' there is little reason now to
use the session to bully Bush, the relative new kid on the block.
   Gorbachev might seek to use the meeting to ``emphasize his desire
that the United States and the Soviet Union move forward on the
START (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) and also make a pitch for the
major steps he's taken in Afghanistan,'' said Raymond Garthoff, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington.
   Garthoff, who specializes in U.S. Soviet relations and was a
onetime delegate to the SALT talks, said the session appears
designed ``not to conclude, and not to even conduct much business.''
   ``It's to touch base, and to give both sides a symbolic boost, as
well as add some momentum to the process,'' he said.
   Both Odom and Garthoff noted that since Gorbachev has other
events planned for his New York stay, he appears interested in
making an impression beyond the few hours he's spending on
Governor's Island with Reagan and Bush, leading to even less of a
chance of a Reykjavik confrontation.
   ``With his visit to the Metropolitan and his speech at the U.N.,
he wants to show a Soviet leader who is interested in American
culture ... a leader interested in building a more stable world
order,'' Garthoff said.
   ``I don't know of a case where a Soviet leader shows up on
American soil to punch an American president in the nose. It would
be unprecedented,'' Odom said.

   The ashes of union legend Joe Hill _ what's
left of them 73 years after he was executed by a Utah firing squad _
are back in the hands of the heirs to his legacy, who are looking
for a fitting way to dispose of them.
   ``I've got them right here in the safe,'' said Brian Myers of the
Industrial Workers of the World.
   The union got the ashes in November from the National Archives,
which had held them as part of a file handed over by federal agents
who had seized them at a post office in Chicago.
   Hill was cremated in Chicago after he died before a Utah firing
squad for killing a Salt Lake City grocery store owner.
   His final wish was to have his body taken out of Utah and
cremated with his ashes to be scattered in every state but the one
that killed him.
   The union, whose members were known as the Wobblies, now is
considered something of a curiosity but it once was regarded as a
serious threat to the established order during its heyday in the
first two decades of this century. Its membership now is about
one-tenth of the 100,000 it had around World War I.
   After Hill's death, portions of his ashes were mailed throughout
the country, in accordance with his wishes.
   One of those envelopes, carrying the union's imprint and a
picture of Hill, was snagged by a machine in the Post Office in 1917
and the contents began to spill out. The ashes were considered
seditious and were seized by federal agents under a World War I
espionage law.
   ``The archivists who dealt with these records knew they were
there,'' said Jill Brett, a spokeswoman for the National Archives.
``They came to us in 1944, so we knew that we had them.''
   Virtually nobody else knew the ashes were there until mention of
them popped up in a United Auto Workers union magazine feature on
strange items kept by the archives, Myers said from the IWW's
Chicago headquarters.
   The union asked for them back, and after some deliberation the
archives, which is more in the habit of keeping things than giving
them away, decided to part with Hill's ashes _ but decided to keep
the envelope they were found in.
   ``We could certainly turn over the ashes because they weren't
records,'' Ms. Brett said.
   The ashes were handed over with little fanfare and were taken
back to Chicago. Myers said having the ashes in the safe is not as
spooky as the portrait of Hill that hangs above his desk.
   The union has formed a committee to decide how to dispose of
Hill's ashes, and Myers says there have been plenty of suggestions,
``ranging from silly requests, such as they should be injected in
Michael Dukakis' arm, to very heartening requests.''
   While no decision has been made, some ceremony probably will be
held next May Day, he said.

   More uncertainty shrouds the policy that
President-elect George Bush will pursue in Central America than
perhaps any other foreign policy issue facing the new
administration, according to experts in and out of government.
   Bush has been sending mixed signals about his intentions, telling
an interviewer in October he ``absolutely'' would support a renewal
of military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras under certain conditions,
but leaving a different impression in more recent comments.
   No less a foe of Contra aid than House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, said after a post-election meeting with Bush that he is
``encouraged to believe that there is a search for a policy that
will be acceptable'' both to Bush and the Congress.
   As an example of Bush's seeming ambiguity on the issue, he said
in late November that he has worked ``long and hard'' for Contra aid
but is now ``perfectly willing to encourage the peace process'' if
it will lead to democracy in Nicaragua. He left unclear his position
on military aid to the rebels.
   The uncertainty about Bush's future course is compounded by the
absence of hard information on whom Bush will select to replace
President Reagan's top aide for Central America, Elliott Abrams.
   There is no shortage of names being mentioned by official and
unofficial sources _ one list on Capitol Hill has 22 candidates on
it _ but it is not clear whether any of the names are under serious
consideration.
   Beyond that, no one on the Bush team has been selected to focus
exclusively on Central American issues. Veteran Contra leader Adolfo
Calero says he has no idea what the new administration will do.
   Secretary of State-designate James Baker has been keeping a low
profile since his appointment Nov. 9, not wishing to leave the
impression that he is encroaching on the prerogatives of the
outgoing administration.
   Since last March, the bulk of the Contras have fled Nicaragua and
are living at austere camps on the Honduran side of the border,
receiving food, clothing and other necessities under a U.S. relief
program.
   No military aid has been sent to the Contras since February and
Wright believes that issue is now dead.
   But Abrams, who has been more identified with the Contra cause
than perhaps anyone else in the U.S. government, continues to argue
that Contra military pressure on the Sandinista government is the
only path to democracy in Nicaragua.
   ``You can't get there without the resistance,'' Abrams said
recently.
   A new position paper by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank, basically endorses Abrams' view.
   Written by former Sen. Richard Stone, D-Fla., a onetime adviser
on Central America to the State Department, the report urges that
Bush seek military aid for the Contras if the Sandinista government
does not ``dismantle its Marxist-Leninist structure'' within three
months after the January inauguration.
   But Sol Linowitz, a former ambassador to the Organization of
American States, writes in the current issue of Foreign Affairs
magazine that the new administration should confine any aid to the
Contras to humanitarian items.
   Linowitz recommends renewed emphasis on the Central American
peace plan which was signed by the five Central American presidents
in August 1987.
   The plan basically calls for non-aggression among the governments
of Central America, an end to external support for the Contras and
other insurgencies in the region and respect for political freedoms.
   It is considered highly unlikely that Bush will ask for Contra
military aid as a first step in dealing with Nicaragua. The lack of
congressional support for such a step is apparent.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the chief deputy majority whip, says,
``The American people have overwhelmingly opposed this policy. So,
eventually, you would expect this policy to end.''
   But Stone says the Contra cause might be revived if the
Sandinistas fail to move toward democracy after being given a
three-month trial period by the new administration.
   On the other hand, Paul Reichler, a Washington lawyer who has
represented the Sandinista government for nine years, says a
resumption of Contra aid ``will set fire to the negotiating table.''
   He maintains that a display of good will by Washington would
underscore Sandinista willingness to abide by all the points of the
Central America peace plan, including fair elections and respect for
the sovereignty of neighboring countries.
   ``If we renew the war, the Sandinistas will simply fight harder
to defeat the Contras,'' Reichler says. ``They will obtain more
weapons from the Soviet bloc and will further postpone the
implementation of full democracy until they win the war.''

   U.S. economic growth will slow dramatically
next year, reflecting weaker consumer spending and rising
inflationary pressures, economists for the country's major
corporations predicted today.
   Members of the National Association of Business Economists said
President-elect George Bush should make reducing the budget deficit
his No. 1 priority but their gloomy assessment of the economy, if it
comes true, would make that job much more difficult.
   Two out of five of the economists surveyed said the country
probably will be in a recession by this time next year and an
overwhelming 88 percent predicted that the next downturn will arrive
before the end of 1990.
   ``Our membership has been fairly consistent over the past year in
holding to the belief that there will be a recession sometime in the
1989 or 1990 period,'' said Jay Woodworth, senior economist at
Bankers Trust Co. of New York and president of the association.
   The NABE economic outlook, based on responses from 200 of the
group's members, was far more pessimistic on economic growth,
interest rates and inflation than the assumptions the Reagan
administration is using to prepare its final budget request to
Congress.
   Among the group's forecasts:
   _The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product,
will grow an anemic 2.2 percent next year. This compares to the
administration's forecast of 3.5 percent GNP growth next year.
Through the first nine months of 1988, the economy has been
expanding at an annual rate of 3 percent.
   _Consumer prices, which have been rising at a 4.6 percent annual
rate so far this year, will climb by 5 percent next year. The
administration is looking for inflation to increase just 3.7 percent
in 1989.
   _Interest rates, which have been rising, will probably peak in
the first half of 1989, responding to further credit tightening on
the part of the Federal Reserve, as the central bank moves to dampen
inflationary pressures. Thirty-year bonds will average 9.5 percent
next year, up from 9 percent this year. By contrast, the
administration is looking for interest rates to drop by one-half
percentage point.
   The assumptions on the economy play a major role in determining
the size of the federal budget deficit. Growth and inflation
estimates affect the size of revenue predictions, and interest rate
forecasts suggest how much the government will have to spend to
finance the $2.6 trillion national debt.
   The Reagan administration, using its far more optimistic
assumptions, is projecting a federal deficit of $135 billion in the
fiscal year that begins next October. That means the administration
is likely to propose just $35 billion in deficit cuts in the budget
it sends Congress on Jan. 9 to meet the deficit target of $100
billion called for in the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.
   However, Woodworth said the business economists believe the
federal deficit will be much nearer the $155.1 billion run up in the
current fiscal year, meaning that the task facing Bush to reduce the
deficit without resorting to higher taxes will be more difficult.
   In a survey on policy questions, the economists ranked cutting
the budget deficit through a combination of lower spending and
higher taxes as the most urgent policy action the Bush
administration should take.
   Bush has continued to reject calls for higher taxes, saying the
deficit can be reduced through a flexible freeze, by which overall
government growth would be held to the rate of inflation.
   While the flexible freeze received support among some economists,
it was also dismissed by a large number of analysts with 46 percent
ranking it as their lowest priority.
   Another pressing problem the economists said the Bush
administration must quickly deal with will be how to handle bankrupt
savings and loan institutions. Estimated costs of a government
bailout range from $50 billion to $100 billion.
   ``Every month that the insolvent institutions are allowed to
remain open generates another $1.5 billion in net losses that sooner
or later will have to be funded by Washington,'' Woodworth said.
   On other economic questions, the business economists predicted
that consumer spending will grow by just 2 percent next year, after
adjusting for inflation, the slowest increase since the current
recovery began in late 1982.
   Business investment, which shot up by an estimated 10.1 percent
this year, will slow considerably next year as well to around 4.3
percent, they said.
   The U.S. trade deficit, which is expected to narrow to $135
billion this year after hitting a record $170.1 billion last year,
will improve by another $20 billion in 1989, the economists forecast.
   The unemployment rate, which edged up to 5.4 percent in November,
could creep up a bit further next year because of the expected
sluggish growth. The economists forecast a jobless rate averaging
5.6 percent in 1989.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador,
who has liver cancer, was improving but still unable to eat after
three days in the hospital to treat an intestinal infection, his
doctor said.
   Duarte, 63, was hospitalized Thursday night. He had just attended
the inauguration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and met with
Salinas and several other Latin American leaders.
   Stomach X-rays taken Sunday ``are very encouraging,'' said Dr.
Jose Luis Saca, who accompanied Duarte on the trip. He said doctors
might soon be able to give Duarte solid food if more tests show
continued improvement.
   Duarte, who in 1984 became his central American country's first
democratically elected president in 50 years, was diagnosed in June
with cancer in his stomach and liver. Most of his stomach was
removed.
   At the time, he was given between six and 18 months to live, but
doctors said recently that his condition had improved remarkably in
the past two months.

<HEAD>Farmers' Subsidy Views on Collision Course with Budget Squeeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Midwestern and Southern farmers believe
economic times on the farm have grown worse in recent years and
don't want the government to cut spending for farm programs _ a view
that seems certain to run head-on into harsh budget realities.
   A survey released last week by Rural Voice, a non-profit policy
group created by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., found that three out of four farmers believe the
government is spending the right amount or too little on farm
subsidies.
   At the same time, outgoing Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
predicted that as much as $3 billion of the current $13 billion farm
program cost will have to be cut next year as part of the $30
billion or so in cuts needed to help the government reach its
deficit-reduction target.
   Farm programs and defense spending are the most frequently cited
targets for cuts when Congress returns next month.
   The survey of 270 farmers, conducted in August and released at a
Capitol Hill news conference last week, found that while they
believe government spending on farm programs should not be cut,
nearly three out of five believe the government makes poor use of
the money it does spend on farmers.
   About one in three said the current farm law, passed in 1985, is
effective. Thirty-nine percent said the law either has been not very
effective or has made matters worse, and 25 percent said they did
not know what its effect has been.
   Leahy said the survey results indicate ``we have a clear
challenge before us. Farmers are telling us they are not interested
in bigger programs. They want more effective programs, which help
them compete in the world market.''
   Added Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., a member of the organization's
board of directors: ``These farmers are saying, `Give us the
incentive to do better, to continue to be the most productive and
efficient farmers in the world, but help us get through these tough
times.'''
   Agriculture Department economists speaking at the department's
annual outlook conference last week projected better times ahead for
farmers. Commodity prices will continue to be strong, they said,
with record-tying sales of $148 billion to $152 billion forecast.
   Farmers will be less dependent on direct government subsidies,
the economists said. Direct federal payments are forecast at $9
billion to $11 billion, reflecting in part the tightening of some
commodity supplies by this year's drought.
   The Rural Voice survey found farmers themselves divided over
specific policy alternatives as Congress begins to consider
directions for new farm legislation.
   Half of those surveyed said the government should put more effort
into non-agricultural industries and jobs in rural areas. Strong
majorities favored targeting farm program benefits to small and
medium-sized family farms (72 percent), strengthening regulations on
pesticide use (74 percent) and expanding the Conservation Reserve to
reduce use of pesticides (68 percent).
   Fifty-six percent favored higher price-support levels for crops
and 59 percent said they approve of the use of export subsidies to
protect U.S. world market share.
   A majority, 62 percent, said they support the gradual elimination
of all farm subsidies worldwide over a 10-year period if all
countries participate, but they narrowly opposed _ 50 to 42 percent
_ unilateral action to end subsidies.

   Actor Dennis Quaid made a surprise
appearance at a nightclub when he joined Jerry Lee Lewis for a set
of songs before a standing-room-only crowd.
   Quaid, who is in Memphis to film the motion picture ``Great Balls
Of Fire'' about Lewis' early years, joined Lewis at the piano and
ran through the title song ``Great Balls Of Fire,'' `` Somewhere
Over The Rainbow'' and several other tunes on the piano while Lewis
moved to the guitar.
   The audience sat on the dance floor as Lewis put on two shows.
Quaid joined him about 1 a.m. Sunday after the two talked for about
45 minutes in the dressing room.
   ``Jerry Lee is my hero,'' Quaid told the crowd. ``There is only
one Jerry Lee.''
   Quaid led the cheering for Lewis most of the night.
   Bob McCarver, Lewis' father-in-law who promoted the show, said,
``It was the largest crowd I have ever seen at the Vapors-Bab Bob's.
There must have been close to 1,100 people during the night. We
probably turned away at least 400 people.''

   Soul singer James Brown joined in and sang
two songs during a benefit concert he staged as part of his
probation for drug and weapons charges.
   The ``Wrestle-Rock '88'' concert and wrestling show Sunday
attracted only 400 people in an arena that seats 7,500.
   ``The thought was the message,'' said Brown, known as ``The
Godfather of Soul.''
   ``The turnout didn't bother me.''
   Brown's agent said before the concert it was costing the singer
about $40,000 to stage the event, whose proceeds is to go to the
Aiken, S.C., chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police to help needy
families.
   The event was a condition of the probation Brown received in May,
after pleading no contest to a charge of possession of the
hallucinogen PCP and pleading guilty to carrying a pistol and
resisting arrest near his home in Beech Island, S.C.
   Brown said if he ever did another benefit show, he would
concentrate more on being ``advertised, not criticized.''

   Wayne ``The Great'' Gretzky, who
has won eight National Hockey League scoring championships, was held
scoreless by a group kids, but he was playing on asphalt not ice.
   The Los Angeles Kings' superstar was held in check Sunday by the
Bay Harbor Devils, a Southern California Amateur Hockey Association
team, during an informal game of street hockey.
   ``I haven't played street hockey in a long time,'' Gretzky said
after the game. ``The kids were better than me.''
   The Devils split into two teams with Gretzky taking turns playing
for each side. They played with sticks, gloves, helmets and a sponge
ball.
   When Gretzky was not playing, he was signing autographs for
members of the crowd of about 300. The game was sponsored by Nike,
which was promoting its new denim jeans.
   Gretzky was traded to the Kings last summer by the Edmonton
Oilers.

   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov plans to stop
in Paris for a few days to attend a celebration of the 40th
anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, a relative says.
   French President Francois Mitterrand invited Sakharov to make the
stop on the Nobel laureate's way back to the Soviet Union, said
Efrem Yankelevich, a son-in-law of Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner.
   The visit to France would change Sakharov's schedule, but
Yankelevich said Sunday he and family members were unsure when the
Soviet physicist would leave the United States or when he would
arrive in Moscow.
   Sakharov has been in the United States since Nov. 4.
   The universal Declaration of Human Rights was passed by the
United Nations on Dec. 10, 1948, and spells out fundamental human
rights. The date is observed each year as International Human Rights
Day.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
visited the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and praised its crew for
keeping last week's fire on the flight deck from turning into a
major disaster, officials said.
   Carlucci, on the second of a four-day swing through the Persian
Gulf region, flew by helicopter Sunday from Oman to the
nuclear-powered carrier off the coast in the Arabian Sea.
   Earlier in the day, he visited two Omani military installations.
   During several hours aboard the 90,944-ton carrier, Carlucci was
shown the location of Wednesday's pre-dawn fire that killed two
sailors and damaged seven aircraft, U.S. officials said.
   In a videotaped message broadcast on the ship's closed-circuit
system, he ``praised the entire ship's efforts'' in dealing with an
emergency that could have been much worse, one official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted
Carlucci as saying safety drills and intensive training for
emergencies enabled firefighters to contain the blaze within 20
minutes on a flight deck where many other aircraft were parked.
   Investigators are still trying to determine why a 20mm gun on an
A-7E Corsair fighter-bomber accidentally fired a burst during an
overhaul, igniting a parked A-6D tanker plane.
   One sailor was killed in the fire and a second died of burns on
Friday in a U.S. military hospital in West Germany.
   Carlucci's gulf itinerary also includes stops in Bahrain, Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait before he returns to Washington.
   U.S. officials say his tour is probably the last by a top Reagan
administration official to the gulf, where the United States has
over the past 18 months conducted its biggest naval operation since
Vietnam.
   President Reagan ordered the buildup of U.S forces to protect
U.S.-flagged shipping and help protect gulf sea lanes after the
Iraq-Iran war escalated in the waterway in mid-1987.
   The Pentagon says the U.S. force, still 25 ships, will be scaled
back gradually if the Iraq-Iran cease-fire, in effect since Aug. 20,
continues to hold.

<HEAD>Head of Black Medical College Candidate for HHS Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the only predominantly black
medical school founded in the United States this century has emerged
as a candidate to head the Department of Health and Human Services
in President-elect George Bush's administration.
   Although there is no indication Bush is prepared to move quickly
on the HHS post, the selection of Dr. Louis W. Sullivan of the
Morehouse School of Medicine would be in line with Bush's stated
desire to find qualified blacks for his Cabinet.
   Bush's wife, Barbara, serves on the Morehouse board of trustees
and the vice president himself stood beside Sullivan in 1982 when
the new medical school moved into its first permanent home.
   Mrs. Bush delivered congratulations from President Reagan at
ceremonies in 1985 when the Atlanta school graduated its first
full-fledged class of medical students.
   Another HHS secretary candidate also said to be under active
consideration is Dr. Monroe Trout, a doctor and lawyer who serves on
the Morehouse board with Mrs. Bush and was active in Republican
politics in Connecticut before moving to California to head a chain
of non-profit hospitals.
   Trout, who is white, has declined to talk to reporters but has
acknowledged to friends that he is interested in the job and was in
Washington recently to discuss the possibility with individuals and
groups with a keen interest in the HHS post, although not
necessarily directly with Bush operatives.
   For his part, Sullivan said last week that he has had no contact
with Bush or his transition staff about any job, but added that he
was aware a number of Republicans have recommended to Bush that he
be named to the top job at HHS.
   The same sources who said Sullivan and Trout are under active
consideration said Rep. Willis Gradison of Ohio, ranking Republican
on the Ways and Means health subcommittee that oversees Medicare and
many other HHS programs, remains on the ``short list.''
   Gradison has declined to discuss his prospects with reporters,
but sources familiar with the congressman's thinking said he is not
pushing for the job even though he was frequently mentioned for it
long before Bush's election.
   Gradison was in Bush's graduating class at Yale, but the two were
not particularly close at the time. Gradison entered the school when
he was 16 years old, the same year Bush enrolled after returning
from service in World War II.
   While Gradison has more detailed knowledge of the workings of
HHS, a huge agency with more than 100,000 employees and a budget
larger than the Pentagon, there is widespread speculation that Bush
might want to follow the precedent set by Reagan with the
appointment of Dr. Otis R. Bowen and name another physician to
succeed him.
   Bowen, a former two-time Republican governor of Indiana with
close ties to Bush, has made clear he wants to return home to tend
his garden in retirement.
   However, Bush is known to value the country doctor's counsel and
sent his personnel chief to confer privately with Bowen last week,
about the same time sources learned that Sullivan's name had been
put in play.
   Another new name that surfaced last week was that of retired Navy
Adm. James Watkins, who enhanced his national reputation as chairman
of the White House AIDS commission.
   Watkins was the major force in pushing the commission to
recommend adoption of federal legislation to ban discrimination
against people infected with the AIDS virus _ a position Bush made a
point of embracing during his campaign even though Reagan had
stopped short of that stance in referring the anti-discrimination
question to the Justice Department for study.
   Social Security Commissioner Dorcas Hardy has made no secret of
her desire for a promotion in a Bush administration and has long
been considered a serious candidate because of her gender and
familiarity with the department, of which the Social Security
Administration is a part.
   However, she is more closely identified with Reagan's
conservative policies than other often-mentioned candidates and may
have been damaged further by recent news stories regarding Social
Security activities.
   One concerned a low-level draft proposal to change the appeals
process for people denied Social Security benefits. The proposal
became public before reaching either Hardy or her chief deputies for
review and Hardy subsequently disavowed it.

<HEAD>Report Recommends Bush Switch to Housing Vouchers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush should substitute
vouchers for low-income housing programs when he takes office next
month, according to a report made public today by a conservative
think-tank with close ties to Republican administrations.
   ``Housing vouchers are the best general method of assisting
low-income Americans to obtain housing,'' says the report from the
Heritage Foundation. ``Since a voucher provides a family with a
certificate of a given value, which can be supplemented, as desired,
by family income, it gives low-income Americans the freedom to
choose how much they wish to spend on housing and encourages tenants
to shop around for the best available unit.''
   Under the voucher program, the poor would receive government
certificates redeemable for rent anywhere they want to live. Such a
system, the report says, would help more than twice as many
low-income families using the same amount of government resources.
   The report, a chapter of a forthcoming book, was written by Peter
J. Ferrara, a George Mason University law professor and former
official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It said
the Bush administration should propose funding in fiscal 1990 for
100,000 additional housing vouchers to replace low-income housing
policies which subsidize the construction and operation of public
and private housing projects.
   Ferrara said the administration should restrict future housing
construction for the elderly, the handicapped and Indians on
reservations.
   The recommendations are contained in the 953-page book, ``Mandate
for Leadership III: Policy Strategies for the 1990s.'' The first
such volume was released shortly after the 1980 election and became
a blueprint for the Reagan administration. The second was published
after the 1984 election.
   The new book, examining hundreds of government policies and
programs, is the most ambitious, involving some 400 foundation
scholars, legislative experts from Capitol Hill and former
government officials.
   In his chapter, Ferrara said Bush also should push for sweeping
changes in housing laws to enable hundreds of thousands of
low-income families to become homeowners.
   He said the president's objective should be to transfer 20
percent of all public housing units to tenant ownership or
management by the end of his first term.
   Currently, more than 1 million U.S. families live in public
housing and the federal government spends some $15.4 billion a year
on low-income housing projects, according to Ferrara.
   ``Turning residents into managers and owners gives them a strong
personal stake in the properties and the incentive to improve
maintenance and living conditions,'' he wrote.
   Ferrara also said the voucher system would help alleviate the
problem of homelessness by enabling low-income homeless families to
obtain housing at a fraction of what it costs the government to
maintain ``welfare hotels.''
   Single men and women who are homeless because of mental illness,
alcoholism or drug addiction should be given shelter in community
mental health centers and treatment clinics for substance abuse, he
said.
   In general, Ferrara said, public housing ``locks poor families
into generally poor neighborhoods where they and their children
easily become victims of deterioration, violence, crime, drug
dealers and other social pathologies.''

<HEAD>NRC Pushing Enhanced Nuke Security Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is imposing
new regulations to strengthen protection against possible terrorist
attacks at facilities handling weapons-grade nuclear material.
   A leading congressional critic, however, calls the security
precautions ``totally inadequate'' because they apply to only a
handful of fuel facilities and not to the nation's 110 nuclear power
plants.
   In a rule set to take effect Dec. 12, the NRC said it is amending
its regulations to ``strengthen security requirements designed to
prevent the theft of nuclear material from certain nuclear fuel
facilities.''
   The new requirements include:
   _Bolstered security measures to guard against possible use of
vehicles to break into facilities or cause damage with car or truck
bombs.
   _``Tactical response team exercises'' to evaluate performance of
security systems.
   _Night firing practice for guards ``using all assigned weapons.''
   _Thorough searches of personnel and packages entering the
facilities.
   _Posting of armed guards at nuclear material access control
points.
   _An additional ``physical personnel barrier'' around a protected
area.
   The requirements initially will affect four NRC-licensed
facilities, operated by GA Technologies at La Jolla, Calif.; Nuclear
Fuel Systems at Erwin, Tenn.; Babcock & Wilcox at Lynchburg, Va.;
and United Nuclear Corp. at Uncasville, Conn.
   One or two additional facilities may also be affected in the near
future, the NRC said.
   An NRC news release said the decision to require enhanced
protective measures at the fuel facilities ``is based on a recent
study that compared NRC's security requirements for strategic
special nuclear material with the Department of Energy's recently
upgraded security system for comparable facilities.''
   ``The changes are also supported by reviews of safeguards event
reports, regulatory effectiveness reviews, licensing actions and
inspection reports,'' it said.
   The NRC plan was sharply criticized by Rep. Sam Gejdenson,
D-Conn., chairman of the House Interior oversight and investigations
subcommittee, which has held hearings on the threat of sabotage and
terrorism to commercial nuclear power plants.
   ``It's totally inadequate,'' he said. ``While it increases the
precautions taken at a select few nuclear facilities regulated by
the NRC, it leaves the bulk of our 110 nuclear power plants with a
standard for protection against terrorist attacks which is totally
unrealistic.
   ``After two years and more of reviewing the security at nuclear
facilities, I think the NRC frankly hasn't fulfilled its
responsibilities to the American people and to the nuclear
community.''
   Gejdenson added, ``We plan to continue an effort to try to get
the NRC to strengthen the protections for these power facilities. If
not, we'll move with legislation.''
   Alan Kuperman, issues director for the Nuclear Control Institute,
a Washington-based public interest group, also was critical of the
NRC move because it doesn't apply to nuclear power plants.
   ``This is certainly a step in the right direction,'' he said.
``It could well be adequate as far as theft goes. But perhaps the
greater danger is the threat of radiological sabotage from an attack
on a reactor.''
   Pointing to the type of massive truck bomb that was used against
U.S. Marines in Lebanon, Kuperman noted that reactor containments
are ``built to keep gases in the event of an accident from breaking
the containment from the inside. But they're not built to withstand
that much pressure from the outside.''
   ``So a large blast, even from the perimeter barrier, could _
according to a Sandia National Laboratory study _ result in
unacceptable damage to the reactor,'' he said.

   Governors Island is an apt setting for a meeting
between the leaders of the world's nuclear rivals _ it bristles with
fortifications never tested.
   Two years ago the island was the epicenter of the spectacular
Liberty Weekend celebration, and on Wednesday it will be the scene
of a meeting between Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan and George
Bush.
   Having survived the Statue of Liberty rededication, Governors
Island is one of the few places on the planet that can regard the
prospect of a superpower meeting with equanimity.
   With its late-night construction and rehearsals, its parking
shortages, and its general confusion, ``the Statue of Liberty
(celebration) was a pain,'' Heidi Balsamo, an island resident, said
last week. ``At least this can't be that bad.''
   Harry Apicos, principal of P.S. 26 on the island, hoped not: ``A
lot of people here don't want anything like that again.
   ``My own school was adversely affected,'' he added. ``The White
House press corps was here.''
   Located just off Manhattan's southern tip in New York Harbor, the
173-acre island is one of the nation's oldest military installations
and has been a Coast Guard base since 1966.
   Over three centuries, Governors Island also has served as a
quarantine station and a recruiting depot, a summer resort and a
prison, an air field and a race track, a pheasant preserve and a
sheep farm. Until the Coast Guard arrived, it was an Army base.
   Purchased from Indians by the Dutch in 1634, the island's name
stems from an act of the New York Assembly in 1698 which set it
aside ``for the benefit and accommodation of His Majesty's
Governors.''
   The 1708 brick manor house where the colonial governors lived is
the oldest building on the island, one of five on the National
Register of Historic Places.
   By the beginning of this century, harbor tides had washed away
about 100 of the island's 170 acres. Sand dredged from the harbor's
channels and rock excavated from subway construction were used to
restore the island to roughly its original size.
   Historic buildings include Fort Jay, a star-shaped fortress built
in 1798; Castle Williams, which, along with a similar fort on
Manhattan's Battery, controlled the approach to the East River and
discouraged a British attack on New York in the War of 1812; and the
Admiral's House, an imposing brick home with front and rear columned
porticos which housed the likes of Gens. Winfield Scott, John J.
Pershing and Omar Bradley.
   The island has had less successful residents, including hundreds
of Confederate prisoners during the Civil War.
   Today, Governors Island is the Coast Guard's largest
installation, a base from which it conducts operations halfway
across the Atlantic.
   Despite its location in the midst of the nation's busiest harbor,
a seven-minute ferry ride from Wall Street, Governors Island is also
a sleepy service town of 4,000 residents, some of whom don't bother
to lock their doors.
   The island is open to the public for visits only two days a year,
so Coast Guard personnel and their families have it all to
themselves: the school, the bank and the only golf course with a
Manhattan zip code.
   The community center is the 16-lane bowling alley, which has its
own Burger King _ the only one in New York that serves beer.
   ``You can't have a bowling alley without beer,'' a base official
once explained. ``That's un-American.''
   A tape-recorded rendition of ``The Star Spangled Banner'' is
piped across the island each morning to mark the raising of the
colors, and each evening ``Retreat'' is sounded as the flag is
lowered.
   Despite the martial atmosphere, the island has never seen combat,
and each spring flowers sprout from the ground at the base of Fort
Jay's cannons.

   The nation's leading theater
re-opened, thanks to a $1.5 million donation from the Swedish
government, with a performance by a Swedish troupe directed by the
daughter of filmmaker Ingmar Bergman.
   The Ruben Dario Theater, named for the country's most famous poet
and inaugurated in 1969, had been closed for two years because of
problems with its sound and air-conditioning systems.
   Admision was free to Sunday's opening night show, which featured
the collective Backa Theater, directed by Eva Bergman. In addition
to the theater group, the program included a concert of Scandinavian
music.
   The evening's program was part of Swedish-Nicaraguan Cultural
Week, in which Scandanavian artists have been performing in
provincial cities and the capital.
   The audience Sunday included Vice President Sergio Ramirez and
Interior Minister Tomas Borge.

   Brian Braje might be called the Lord of

   He has key rings that light up, do multiplication, and others
that read, ``I love Bingo'' and ``I love Jesus.''
   He has a Michael Jackson and Boy George key ring and one that
looks like a pickle. And enough glow-in-the-dark key rings are in
his room to give it an eerie, greenish cast when the lights are out.
   The 16-year-old mentally and physically disabled boy from this
community 40 miles northwest of Chicago enjoys his collection, said
his stepmother, Judy Braje.
   ``Everyone looks for a niche in life,'' said Mrs. Braje. ``If a
special child can find his and really grasp it, he can blossom.''
   Brian has the physical appearance of a 7-year-old, his speech is
difficult to understand and he has trouble grasping many elementary
concepts.
   But his limitations do not extend to collecting key rings.
   Brian started the collection four years ago, and it has grown to
1,256.
   ``He gets very excited when he gets a new one or when he finds
one in the store. He seems to have almost a radar for them,'' said
Mrs. Braje.

   Braving a scorching sun that sent
temperatures to 98 degrees, worried Argentines filled plazas to
repudiate an army revolt they viewed as a threat to their 5-year-old
democracy.
   Hundreds of others journeyed to the outskirts of the capital to
shout insults and throw rocks at rebel soldiers, who sprayed them
with tear gas and fired rubber bullets and live ammunition.
   News reports said four people were killed.
   In downtown Buenos Aires, teen-agers, many shirtless and wearing
shorts, young couples with children in tow and the elderly in their
Sunday best sought shade or strolled around the giant plaza facing
the green-domed National Congress building.
   Still littered with debris left by 150,000 demonstrators Saturday
night, the plaza throbbed with the beat of bass drums pounded by
perspiring youngsters.
   ``We've been here since yesterday morning,'' said Maria Cabrera
Garandan, 30, of suburban Lanus Este. ``I think there's going to be
a fight between the military, but I believe it will turn out all
right.''
   ``We represent a lot of different political groups,'' she said,
pointing to the banners representing most of Argentina's center and
leftist parties. ``But we're united now by a common cause against
the rebels.''
   Esteban Fernandez, 48, trying to eat an ice-cream cone before it
melted, described himself as ``just another Argentine, an apolitical
one, who is sick and tired of military coups.''
   Argentina has experienced six coups that toppled elected
governments since 1930.
   ``I'm here to support democracy,'' said Fernandez, who came to
the plaza Saturday night and again Sunday, his only day off, along
with his two children ``so they can learn something.''
   ``There's a little bit of everything here, socialists,
communists, you name it, but we all have to learn to live
together,'' said his son Manuel, 21, a university student. His
daughter, Alicia, 19, nodded in agreement.
   Maria del Carmen Martinez, 25, handed out leftist Workers' Party
pamphlets urging that the rebels be ``squashed'' _ which, she said,
could only occur ``if the workers mobilize and march on the barracks
to put down this rightist uprising.''

   President Roh Tae-woo named a new

But the opposition rejected the shakeup and charged that some new
ministers had supported ``dictatorship.''
   By naming Kang Young-hoon prime minister and installing 19 new
ministers, Roh was attempting to defuse nationwide furor over the
government of former president Chun Doo-hwan and show his commitment
to democratic reform.
   But the new 23-member cabinet consists mainly of appointees from
the governing Democratic Justice Party. There were no dramatic
changes and key law, intelligence and military posts went to
officials who served under Chun.
   A government statement said the changes were ``to put the mind of
the public at rest following the anxiety created by problems of the
past era'' and that the new cabinet would ``ensure further
democratic reforms.''
   Roh had promised a shakeup after appealing Nov. 26 to the nation
for mercy for Chun.
   Opposition parties said today that Roh had not fulfilled promises
to end ties with Chun's authoritarian government and opposition
leaders voiced doubt about Roh's willingness to repudiate Chun.
   ``We are surprised that the new cabinet includes persons who
actively supported dictatorship,'' said Lee Sang-soo, spokesman of
the main opposition Party for Peace and Democracy.
   The Reunification Democratic Party, the other main opposition
party, also criticized Roh's shuffle. ``We are skeptical about the
government's intention to liquidate the Chun government,'' said
party spokesman Suh Chong-won.
   Opposition leaders said they would oppose the appointment of the
new prime minister because Roh had violated the constitution by
failing to first consult the National Assembly on the choice.
   Dissident groups, which have organized a series of violent
protests in recent weeks to demand Chun's arrest and Roh's
overthrow, dismissed the cabinet changes as a deception to continue
military-backed rule.
   It seemed unlikely the changes would have a major impact on
public opinion or diminish widespread demands for strong action
against Chun. South Korean cabinets traditionally have little
authority and most of the ministers dismissed today were relatively
unknown.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980 and stepped down as president in February, went into internal
exile last month after apologizing to the nation for corruption and
human rights abuses.
   Roh, also an ex-general and former Chun ally, has attempted to
defuse the crisis over demands for retribution against Chun by
shaking up the government, releasing political prisoners and
compensating victims of Chun's rule.
   Roh, who won presidential elections last December against a
divided opposition, is opposed to punishing Chun. But he must settle
the crisis without damaging the credibility of his government, which
is still closely identified with Chun.
   Among major appointments, Lee Han-dong, who ran the governing
under Chun, was named home minister with control of the police; Huh
Hyong-koo, a former prosecutor-general under Chun, was named justice
minister; and career diplomat Choi Ho-joong was named foreign
minister.
   Three ministers from the old cabinet were retained.
   Despite earlier government hints that a civilian would be named
to head the key Defense Ministry, former general Lee Sang-hoon was
picked. Lee filled top military posts under Chun.
   Roh named Olympic Games organizer Park Seh-jik to head the
nation's main intelligence agency, the Agency for National Security
Planning. Park is a former general and was deputy chief of the
agency under Chun.
   Prime Minister Kang, a relatively unknown lawmaker, has served as
ambassador to Britain and the Holy See. He was forced out of the
military in 1961 after opposing a military coup headed by former
president Park Chung-hee.
   Kang then obtained a doctorate in political science at Southern
California University.
   Chun, who went into exile at a remote Buddhist monastery after
apologizing to the nation for abuses under his rule, has denied any
personal corruption. Some of his relatives and associates have been
covicted of or charged with embezzlement and other crimes.
   The main opposition parties have said there can be no question of
a pardon for Chun until after he has cooperated with a major
National Assembly probe into widespread abuses under his
administration.

   No more picking mushrooms for Lorenzo
Avalos _ he's got his papers. And he's found that the law extending
amnesty to illegal aliens can mean better pay.
   After applying for amnesty and obtaining legal work papers,
Avalos quit his $4.50-an-hour job picking mushrooms to work at a
meat packing company, where he earns $6.50 an hour. His new job also
provides him with health benefits for the first time.
   ``They treat me better. They pay me better. There's more
opportunity,'' Avalos said recently through an interpreter at his
apartment here.
   But for many farmers, the competition from other industries and
the likely need to pay higher wages to former illegal aliens is
worrisome. They also face fines of up to $10,000 per worker if they
continue to employ illegal aliens.
   ``It could be very serious for us. Very serious,' said Daniel
Boyer, president of the Pennsylvania State Horticultural Association
and owner of Amick Orchards in Johnstown, about 70 miles east of
Pittsburgh.
   A little more than 17,000 migrants go to Pennsylvania each year
for farm work, and about 32,000 others living in the state do
seasonal labor in the fields, according to Art Read, general counsel
for Friends of Farmworkers, a non-profit legal services organization.
   Most of those farm workers were illegal aliens and have been paid
at or slightly above the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour, Read said.
   The immigration act of 1986 allowed illegal alien farm workers to
apply for amnesty and work permits if they could prove they
harvested perishable crops for at least 90 days between May 1, 1985,
and May 1, 1986.
   Up to 1.2 million workers nationwide applied by last Wednesday's
deadline, including 5,000 to 6,000 in Pennsylvania, according to
Jesse Peterson, chief legalization officer at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service office in nearby Lima.
   Aliens could have applied for amnesty in other states. Also, in a
separate phase of the amnesty program that ended in May, the INS
granted temporary residency to about 1.7 million illegals who said
they could prove continuous residency in the United States since
1982.
   Farmers have relied on illegal aliens to pick apples and peaches
in south-central Pennsylvania, tomatoes and other vegetables in the
northeast and grapes in the northwest. They also pick mushrooms
year-round in Chester and Berks counties west and northwest of
Philadelphia.
   But with valid work papers, many aliens may seek other work with
improved pay and conditions.
   ``Most people are looking for a way to get out of mushroooms,''
said Avalos, who came to the United States from Mexico five years
ago. He said he wouldn't have been able to switch jobs without a
work permit.
   ``In order to keep these people from going into other kinds of
farm jobs or industry jobs, the growers will probably have to pay
more money to the mushroom workers,'' said Charlie R. Harris,
executive director of the American Mushroom Institute.
   Harris said higher mushroom prices recently would give growers a
cushion to absorb a rise in wages. He also said he didn't expect a
labor shortage.
   Higher labor costs could put more of a squeeze on financially
hard-pressed orchard owners, Boyer said.
   He said he and other growers will watch what happens with the
Florida orange harvest in the spring and with the tobacco and peach
crops elsewhere in the South. Many of those workers migrate north to
pick apples and peaches in the fall, he said.
   Joseph DiStefano, coordinator for a farmworkers' advocacy group
in Kennett Square in the state's southeast corner, said conditions
for farmworkers would improve only if the new immigration law were
enforced.
   Under the law, the INS can levy fines on employers from $100 for
every worker with inadequate paperwork to $10,000 per worker if a
pattern of illegal hiring can be established.
   ``If the law is not enforced, the grower will try and get the
workers who will work the cheapest and in the worst conditions.
We'll be back to square one,'' DiStefano said.

   Here are a few facts and figures on Argentina:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Argentina, located on the southern end of South
America east of Chile, is four times larger than Texas. It has a
land area of 1.06 million square miles. Its capital is Buenos Aires.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ It has a population of 31.1 million. People of
European descent, especially Spanish and Italian, make up 98 percent
of the population. Other groups include Indians, Mestizos, and
Arabs. Spanish is the official language, and 92 percent of the
people are Roman Catholic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ The country's economy has suffered severe problems
in recent years. Annual inflation stands at 332 percent, and foreign
debt is $56 billion. The problems have led to devaluation of the
currency and persistent strikes. Major crops include grains and
corn. Meat and flour processing are important industries.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY _ Spanish colonists won independence in a struggle
from 1810-19. Large-scale European immigration came in the decades
after 1880. Gen. Juan Peron was elected president after a series of
military coups in 1930-46 and effected labor reform. His wife,
Isabel, succeeded him when he died, but she was ousted in 1976.
Argentine troops seized the disputed Falkland Islands in 1982, but
British troops took them back later that year. Argentina returned to
civilian government in December 1983, when democratically elected
President Raul Alfonsin assumed power from the last of four military
juntas that had ruled since 1976. New elections are planned for May,
with the winner taking office in December. Alfonsin would become the
first Argentine president to complete his term in more than four
decades.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   INSURRECTIONS _ The country has faced several military revolts in
recent times. On April 15, 1987, about 130 officers holed up in an
army camp before surrendering in an uprising sparked by charges of
human rights abuse against a popular officer. Two days later, a
second revolt broke out at the Campo de Mayo army base in suburban
Buenos Aires, ending after Alfonsin himself talked to the mutineers.
In that insurrection, 120 soldiers and officers led by Lt. Col. Aldo
Rico also demanded amnesty for military men accused of human rights
abuses during so-called ``dirty war'' against suspected leftists in
the 1970s, during which 9,000 people were believed killed. Another
revolt flared April 21, 1987, for six hours in the northern city of
Salta. Like the other two, it ended in the surrender of rebellious
troops without violence. Yet another insurrection was put down in
January, with only three wounded.

<HEAD>Dollar And Stocks Down With Reports of Emperor's Worsened Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today
and the dollar inched down against the Japanese yen with reports
that Emperor Hirohito's condition had worsened, dealers said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 133.25 points to
reach a record high on Saturday, lost 50.82 points or 0.17 percent
to finish trading at 29,614.68. On Saturday, the Nikkei climbed to a
high of 29,665.50 by the end of the half-day session.
   The main index fell sharply this morning, losing 213.17 points,
but recovered in the afternoon after reports that the 87-year-old
emperor's condition had stabilized.
   ``There was no economic factor that could have possibly lowered
the Nikkei today,'' said Manji Ueda of Nomura Securities, Japan's
largest brokerage. ``But concerns over emperor's condition made the
market both cautious and directionless.''
   Other traders said that investors have moved to the sidelines
because of news that Hirohito received an emergency transfusion
after hemorrhaging heavily early today.
   The emperor, bedridden since Sept. 19, discharged blood and his
blood pressure plummeted. It recovered after doctors administered
2.13 pints of blood in a transfusion.
   In rather thin trading, volume of shares exchanged on the first
section was estimated at 650 million.
   In foreign currency dealings, the dollar closed at 121.53 yen,
down 0.11 yen from Friday's close of 121.64 yen. Opening slightly
lower at 121.48 yen, the dollar moved in a range of 121.30-121.65
yen.
   ``The dollar rose slightly when market players bought it to get
rid of the yen following news about the emperor, but they bought
back the yen when his condition stabilized in the afternoon,'' said
a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The rate was moving very little around the 121.50-yen mark,''
he said.

   Paul G. Kirk Jr. has decided to resign as chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, The Boston Globe reported
today.
   Kirk believes he has accomplished the goals he set for himself
and feels ``that one term is enough,'' according to a source that
the newspaper did not identify.
   The Globe said Kirk would announce his decision at a news
conference today in Washington.
   Other sources close to Kirk told the newspaper he based his
decision solely on personal concerns. The newspaper said it was
widely known that his wife, Gail, preferred that he step down.
   Kirk, who took over head of the party after the 1984 presidential
election, turned down several requests from leading Democrats that
he remain on the job, the newspaper said.
   Leading candidates to replace Kirk are believed to include Rick
Wiener, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, and Ronald H.
Brown, who worked briefly in the presidential campaigns of the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   Also expected to seek the post are former congressmen Michael
Barnes of Maryland, James Jones of Oklahoma and Jim Stanton of Ohio.

   Here are some facts and figures on Venezuela, where voters went
to the polls Sunday to elect their seventh president since an
authoritarian ruler, Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez, was toppled in 1958:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Venezuela covers 352,143 square miles, an area larger
than Texas and Utah combined. It lies on the north coast of South
America, on the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean. It shares borders
with Brazil on the south, Colombia on the west and Guyana on the
east. It has unsettled border disputes with Guyana and Colombia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Venezuela has 18.43 million people, and its
population is growing at a rate of 2.9 percent, one of the highest
rates in Latin America. The literacy rate is 90 percent, one of the
region's highest. More than 9.1 million people over 18, the voting
age, are registered to vote by the Electoral Council, which
supervises elections.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of the
nation's export revenue. Oil income this year will be $7.1 billion,
down from $9.1 billion in 1987. The plunge in oil prices since the
early 1980s, coupled with a foreign debt of $33 billion, thwarted
plans to expand and modernize the economy. The oil crunch is also
responsible for a sharp decline in the nation's per capita income _
$2,782 in 1986, down from $3,408 in 1980.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Christopher Columbus discovered Venezuela _ named for
Little Venice _ in 1498. Venezuela declared independence in 1811 and
Spain recognized the nation in 1821. Since its separation in 1830
from a federation made up of Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, the
country has had 34 presidents, mostly a succesion of ``caudillos,''
strongmen backed up by local militias, until 1959, when Romulo
Betancourt became the first president of the modern era of democracy.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's condition stabilized today and
his vital signs were near normal after massive blood transfusions to
make up for blood lost during internal hemorrhaging, palace
officials said.
   The 87-year-old monarch's condition is ``picking up ... as can be
seen by his blood pressure,'' said Kenji Maeda, spokesman for the
Imperial Household Agency. He said Hirohito's blood pressure
recovered to 107 over 49 after it fell to 65 over 35 in the morning.
   A healthy person has a reading of about 120 over 80.
   The monarch's temperature was 98.78, Maeda said.
   Hirohito was given 2.13 pints of blood, including a 1.7-pint
emergency transfusion, the spokesman said.
   It was the second time the emperor's blood pressure plummeted to
a dangerously low level since he fell ill Sept. 19 after coughing up
blood. On Nov. 8, his blood pressure dropped to 68 over 30.
   Doctors believe that Hirohito, the world's longest-reigning
monarch, is bleeding mostly in the upper intestinal area where he
underwent a bypass operation in September 1987. In recent days, he
has spent most of his time sleeping and responds very little to
questions from aides, doctors say.
   They have refused to comment on reports the monarch has
pancreatic cancer.

<HEAD>Misuse of Goggles May Have Contributed to Flier Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Manufacturers of night-vision goggles
and pilots who used them contend military officials knew the goggles
were unsafe for flight, according to a published report.
   The goggles, designed for ground troops and not for flight, were
used by 62 military pilots whose helicopters crashed during the last
decade, killing 134 servicemen, The Orange County Register reported
Sunday.
   One instructor said he quit partly because of the goggles.
   Recent crashes blamed on alleged goggle inadequacies prompted
calls for a congressional investigation of night-vision goggle
safety by Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., of the House Armed Services
Committee.
   The night-vision goggles electronically amplify moonlight and
starlight, displaying images on two tiny video screens.
   Military records show that qualified Air Force, Marine and Army
pilots blindly flew into mountains, power lines, trees and other
aircraft while using the goggles, usually on high-speed, low-level
flights, the newspaper reported.
   The goggles are heavy, become overpowered by sudden bright
lights, fail to warn pilots of looming clouds that render them
useless and severely limit peripheral vision, the newspaper said.
   ``Scotch tape the tube from an empty toilet paper roll on each
eye, and you'll know what flying with goggles is like,'' said George
Small, an instructor pilot for the Army at Fort Campbell, Ky., who
retired in November after 20 years of flying in the military.
   Pentagon officials defended use of the goggles for helicopter
flights, telling the newspaper that combat night missions are
essential and that use of the devices is often the only way to get
the job done.
   ``While they have limitations, they give us more capabilities
than we had without them,'' said Lt. Gen. Charles H. Pitman, deputy
chief of staff for Marine aviation. ``We believe we have to keep
doing this so we can be ready when the time comes.''
   Pitman said investigators were justified in blaming the 62
night-vision-related crashes that resulted in the 134 deaths on
pilot error.
   ``If they (pilots) had followed procedures with each of the
accidents we've had ... and used common sense, the accidents
wouldn't have occurred,'' he said.
   Officials at ITT Electro-Optical Products in Roanoke, Va., Varian
Image Tube Division in Palo Alto, and other manufacturers of the
goggles said they have never considered the infantry models suitable
for flight.
   ``ITT's position is that we don't endorse Generation II (infantry
goggles) for flight applications,'' said Jim Eder, an ITT
night-vision program manager.
   ``I kept saying, use these for the mission they were designed for
_ driving,'' said former Army engineer Edward Firth, who headed
development of the infantry goggles before retiring in 1978. ``They
just don't give you enough to fly at high speeds. ... It was an Army
decision to put them in helicopters. They are aware of the risks.''
   The goggles' maximum safe speed limit is 35 mph, Firth said.
   ``Goggle flying was one hairy experience after another,'' said
Clyde Emery, a retired pilot who taught instructors at Fort Rucker,
Ala., and quit in 1981. ``It's one of the reasons I retired. We were
killing people ... and I wanted to live another 20 or 30 years.''
   Emery said pilots frequently deceived superiors by secretly
flying wthout goggles during night missions.
   Night flying gives the United States an enormous edge in combat,
said Maj. Tim McKeever, spokesman for the Army Training and Doctrine
Command at Fort Monroe, Va.
   ``The Russians do not have a very strong night-fighting
capability, either on the ground or in aviation,'' he said. ``They
are deeply concerned about our night-fighting capability.''

<HEAD>Gang Problem Grows Deadlier In Denver</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT C. UNRUH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The migration of two California-based street gangs
to Denver has caused crack sales to soar and led to five slayings
this year, say authorities who fear the problems will grow.
   ``Don't wait another day. These kids are recruiting, getting
stronger and more organized,'' warned Los Angeles gang counselor
Kenneth Wheeler.
   He told a meeting of Denver residents that just two days here
reminded him of several years ago when Los Angeles' gang woes were
in their nascent stages.
   Bernard C. Parks, Los Angeles' deputy police chief, said his
department has the names of 26,000 gang members on file, more than
double the number in the 1970s.
   Denver police point to the arrival of the California-based gangs,
the Crips and the Bloods, as the main cause of the growing gang
problem here.
   ``They came here to make money selling crack. The byproduct was
street gangs,'' said police Sgt. Dave Dawkins, who is specializing
in Denver's gang problem.
   About 700 gang members are in Denver, and they are recruiting two
or three more daily, police said.
   The Crips and Bloods, lured by the prospect of untapped markets
for crack, have been moving into other parts of the country. The
gangs, depicted in the movie ``Colors,'' have been reported as far
north as Anchorage, Alaska, and as far east as Denver.
   Dawkins estimated that gang-related crimes are ``at least
doubling'' each year and that 25 percent of the Denver gang members
are from Southern California originally.
   ``L.A. gang members said we were easy, kind of hicks, because we
weren't as hard on them and our methods were a little different,''
said Dawkins.
   The most recent victim of gang slayings here was Cameron Smith,
18, who was gunned down Nov. 3 on a sidewalk. Police said he was
shot because he was wearing a red cap, the color of the Bloods.
Smith, however, wasn't a gang member.
   ``Had he been just another gang member, it might have been
different,'' said the Rev. Acen Phillips, who organized a rally
after Smith's death. ``The fact is, he was a Christian young man and
he gave his life.''
   Mayor Federico Pena was outraged by the death, blamed on a Crips
member upset over the shooting a day earlier of another Crip. Their
color is blue.
   ``I am not going to tolerate a situation in which citizens have
to worry about what color clothing they are wearing for fear of
being shot,'' Pena said.
   Nearly 100 police officers are assigned to the gang situation.
Intensified efforts include coordinating information and efforts
with other law-enforcement agencies.
   Pena called for ``zero-tolerance.''
   ``That means if they're caught jaywalking, they're arrested,'' he
said.
   But Dawkins said that alone will not deter gang members.
   ``They are kids looking for some kind of recognition they don't
get at home. They gravitate to other kids who have the same
problem,'' he said.
   To help attack the problem's roots, the Salvation Army is
targeting those who might enter gangs, and gang members who want
out, said Anthony Sandoval, director of the missionary
organization's Red Shield community center.
   He said jobs programs and ``intensely recreational, educational
and spiritual'' events at the center itself are part of the plan.
   ``By keeping these young people involved we hope to keep them out
of the streets,'' he said.
   ``One way of killing gangs is by cutting off recruitment,'' said
the Rev. Leon Kelly of the Red Shield center.
   Residents also are helping with these programs. After Smith's
death, church leaders in Denver attracted 1,500 people to a rally.
Phillips, with support from 50 churches, asked men to become Big
Brothers for gang members and women to become prayer leaders.
   Gang members themselves see only further escalation.
   ``We ain't gonna get along,'' said one young gang member who
refused to give his name. ``I'll die a Crip. I'll die straight up.''

   The lucky dozen who won $3.75 million each in New

   The winning numbers announced Saturday night were: 1, 8, 13, 18,
28, 48. Lottery offices were specially opened Sunday but none of the
winners stepped forward.
   They were expected to begin turning in their tickets today,
Gladieux said.
   The holders of the lucky $1 Lotto tickets beat odds of nearly 13
million to 1 in winning the jackpot, the biggest in the lottery's
12-year history.
   Each ticket was worth $3.75 million, or $142,857 annually after
taxes for the next 20 years.
   The jackpot could go higher, when sales are finally tabulated,
said lottery spokesman George Yamin.
   The winning tickets were bought in the New York metropolitan area.
   Gladieux said 37.4 million tickets were sold in the frenzy
leading up to Saturday night's drawing, going at about 28,000 a
minute. The jackpot rose from $26 million after no one won
Wednesday's drawing in the twice-weekly game.
   The biggest previous jackpot awarded in New York was $41 million
in 1985, divided among three tickets, including one held by 21
factory workers.
   The world's biggest lottery jackpot, $61.98 million, was divided
among three winning tickets in California in October.

   The podiatrist connects with a right to the
physical therapist's nose. A little stream of blood appears. And the
aggressor stops.
   It's not a brawl, but a sport attracting an increasing number of
young professionals: boxing.
   Foot-doctor Bob Gerber and Greg Znajda, the physical therapist,
are among those finding pleasure in a sport more often practiced in
the ghetto.
   ``We aren't out to hurt each other,'' said Gerber, 33, explaining
why he stopped after drawing blood on his friend. ``We're here to
learn.''
   At the Degerberg Academy on Chicago's North Side, lawyers,
psychiatrists, computer scientists, teachers and others mix it up
under the tutelage of gym owner and boxing instructor Fred Degerberg.
   ``For business guys, it can give them a competitive edge,''
Degerberg said. ``It makes them more aggressive. Business people
need any edge they can get and they're going to go for it.''
   Whether they're drawn to the gym by an interest in self defense,
a desire to get into shape, or a simple sense of aggression,
Degerberg says many professionals are taking up boxing.
   ``It improves reflexes, strength, timing, flexibility, hand-eye
coordination and it's a great aerobic workout,'' he said.
``Well-to-do people like the sense of being in top shape. They like
to feel they're able to take care of themselves.''
   But they aren't able to hop right into the ring as soon as they
get to the school. At Degerberg's, most take classes on the
principles of self-defense before taking up boxing.
   Gerber began at the gym after he discovered he felt heavy and his
joints felt weak during a ski trip last winter.
   He began by pounding the heavy bag, then graduated to jumping
rope to gain rhythm. He moved on to the speed bag to improve his
hand-eye coordination, and then worked with partners wearing
oversized mitts that he chased with his punches.
   Only then did he learn to jab, cross and hook and to block
punches, and finally climb into the ring.
   ``There has been a definite shift in how I view myself in
relation to other people,'' Gerber said. ``Having done boxing, I'm
less intimidated by people. I have more confidence.'
   ``It's almost mystical to be in there,'' said Znajda, 30, dabbing
blood from his nose after his bout with Gerber. ``When you go into
the ring, the rest of the world goes away.''

   Planes loaded with food for hundreds of
thousands of starving Sudanese began shuttling to rebel- and
government-controlled towns as part of a Red Cross effort to feed
the hungry.
   The first two flights Sunday from Khartoum to Wau, 625 miles
southwest of the capital, carried four to five tons of food, said
Pierre Pont, the Red Cross official in charge of the airlift.
   The food was carried in two U.S.-made Hercules C-130 transport
planes.
   Another two C-130s carried food from Lokichokio, Kenya, to the
border town of Nimule and some other rebel-held towns in south Sudan.
   The $2 million project, financed by the Swiss-based International
Committee of the Red Cross, is scheduled to last two weeks. It will
involve 28 trips from Khartoum to Wau.
   Pont said the airlift is very costly but that most roads are
mined, so planes are the safest way to transport the food.
   He said it's possible the project will be extended beyond the
two-week schedule, ``according to the need of the people and the
situation there,'' adding that a cease-fire agreement made him
optimistic the operation would be a success.
   C-130s will be used to airlift food to Wau, but light Cessna
aircraft will be used in areas where there are no airstrips, Pont
said.
   Pont said he had assurances from the government and the rebels
that the operation would go smoothly.
   Rebels of the predominately Christian and animist Sudan People's
Liberation Army have been fighting the Moslem government for nearly
six years. Last month, the governing coalition agreed to a
cease-fire with the rebels.
   Pont said this agreement had helped in the airlift.
   ``I have the feeling that both sides have now understood relief
should go to the people whatever be the differences between them. We
have the best conditions ever for a successful operation,'' he said.

   Carlos Andres Perez, the son of a
coffee grower who grew up to be president, is closely identified
with his country's best economic times.
   But the Venezuela he will preside over now is facing far more
serious economic problems than the nation he headed in 1974-1979,
when the Arab oil embargo propelled this oil-producing nation to
growth and prosperity.
   The charismatic Perez triumphed over a conservative rival on
Sunday by mixing populist rhetoric with tireless campaigning,
scheduling eight daily campaign stops during the last seven months.
   Whether he's a ``full-time politician'', as he calls himself, or
a political animal, as others have, the balding, 6-foot-1 statesman
seems to lose half of his 66 years whenever he's in a crowd.
   Perez is the son of a coffee grower and the 11th of 12 children.
At age 15, he joined the clandestine National Democratic Party,
which later became Democratic Action party of Romulo Betancourt.
   Perez studied law while working as Betancourt's personal
secretary when the Democratic Action and other democratic parties
overthrew a military government in 1945. Betancourt headed the
revolutionary junta.
   But before he finished law school, Perez was jailed and then
exiled with many militants when the new democracy was crushed by a
1948 military coup led by Col. Marcos Perez Jimenez.
   From exile in Colombia, Cuba and Costa Rica _ where he worked at
the newspaper La Republica in San Jose _ Perez and other party
leaders plotted to remove Perez Jimenez. They succeeded in 1958.
   When Betancourt was elected president a year later, Perez was
elected congressman. He returned to Betancourt's side when the
president selected his protege as interior minister in 1962, at a
time of increasing domestic guerrilla insurgency.
   Perez earned a reputation as a tough law-and-order man in
crushing the movement with force, although it was not fully
eliminated until President Rafael Caldera, who served from 1968 to
1973, sponsored a successful amnesty program.
   By that time, Perez had become the Democratic Action party's
secretary-general, its candidate for president, and, in the 1973
election, its fourth democratically elected president.
   During the next five years, Venezuela's income nearly tripled as
oil prices went through the roof following the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74.
   In 1976, Perez made history when he nationalized the foreign oil
companies operating in Venezuela.
   Perez is credited with having invested many of the incoming
billions of dollars in developing basic industries such as aluminum,
steel and hydroelectricity.
   But he was nearly impeached for his alleged involvement in
receiving kickbacks of tens of thousands of dollars in the public
purchase of a refrigerator ship, the Sierra Nevada, and left office
in disgrace despite his acquittal.
   The Sierra Nevada case is still remembered by voters, and Perez'
main challenger, Eduardo Fernandez, used it as an early campaign
weapon.
   But during these times of economic difficulty, many voters, in
particular the poor and working classes, remember more the
prosperity, full employment and rising living standards of Perez's
first government.

   The star prosecution witness' testimony about
being beaten by her former live-in lover may lead jurors to conclude
that he also beat the 6-year-old illegally adopted girl he is
accused of killing, his lawyer said.
   But Judge Harold Rothwax told the jurors in the murder trial of
disbarred attorney Joel Steinberg that they were hearing testimony
from Hedda Nussbaum solely to gain insight into her state of mind
when Lisa Steinberg was fatally injured Nov. 2, 1987.
   Prosecutors said jurors need to know Ms. Nussbaum's state of mind
at the time so they will understand why she could not have hurt Lisa
herself and why she took no action to help the child.
   Ms. Nussbaum was scheduled to resume her testimony today in state
criminal court, where Steinberg, 47, stands accused of beating Lisa
to death.
   Defense attorney Ira London said he believed the judge was right
to tell the jurors they could not use Ms. Nussbaum's testimony to
decide Steinberg's guilt.
   But London said he thought the instruction was futile.
   ``If Hedda Nussbaum is permitted to testify as to instances of
physical abuse by Joel,'' London said, ``the jury may just conclude
that if he beat Hedda, he beat Lisa.''
   She testified last week that Steinberg beat, starved and
humiliated her.
   In slow cadences punctuated by sighs, gulps and sobs, Ms.
Nussbaum said Steinberg fed her cocaine, cut her off from her
family, brainwashed her into believing she was a cultist who
hypnotized people and got her fired from her job as a children's
book editor at Random House.
   She also testified that she ``worshipped'' Steinberg, believed he
had ``godlike'' powers and was a healer. This, she said, was in part
why she did nothing to help Lisa as the child lay unconscious on the
bathroom floor for hours.
   Ms. Nussbaum initially was charged in Lisa's death, but the
charges were dropped after prosecutors said they found she was
incapable physically and emotionally of hurting or protecting the
child.
   A copy of a letter purportedly written by Ms. Nussbaum about 10
years ago and obtained by Newsweek magazine sheds light on her
childhood and trouble she had asserting herself.
   The letter said that her mother, when pregnant with her, had
wanted an abortion, the magazine reported this week.
   ``(My mother) insisted on doing everything for me _ putting on my
socks at age 6 for example, she said. ``My father, on the other
hand, was always saying, `Listen to me. I'm older. I know better.'
The combination made me feel like I couldn't do anything for myself
and didn't know anything.''
   Lisa, illegally obtained by Steinberg the day after she was born
to an unwed teen-ager, was removed bruised and unconscious from
Steinberg's apartment. She died of head injuries Nov. 5, 1987.
   Ms. Nussbaum has testified that Steinberg admitted to her he
``knocked Lisa down and she didn't want to get up'' about the time
the prosecution says the fatal blow was struck.

   Carlos Andres Perez, who led a wealthy
Venezuela during the oil boom of the 1970s, was re-elected president
after 10 years out of office on a promise to return his debt-ridden
country to prosperity.
   Voters on Sunday remembered the good times rather than the
scandal that almost had Perez impeached in his first administration.
   The latest returns showed Perez, of the left-of-center Democratic
Action Party, with 51.4 percent of the vote and Eduardo Fernandez of
the Social Christian Party with 38.6 percent. The rest of the vote
was shared by 20 minor party candidates.
   The results did not represent all the votes cast, but the
Electoral Council declared Perez the winner after early returns.
   Perez campaigned with almost messianic fervor on his ability to
revive the economy of this oil-producing nation despite a volatile
oil market. A charismatic figure popular with the working class,
Perez favors tighter state control over the economy. Fernandez
favors a freer market.
   ``This is the point of departure for building a bigger Venezuela.
The next government must take advantage of our situation to form the
bases for future growth,'' the president-elect said on national
television.
   Fernandez, 48, conceded defeat minutes after the first returns
were announced.
   Perez, 66, succeeds Jaime Lusinchi, also of the Democratic Action
Party, as Venezuela's leader for the next five years.
   The constitution limits presidents to a single five-year term,
after which they must wait a decade before seeking re-election.
   No official tallies were given on the outcome of voting for the
all-new National Congress of 182 deputies and 44 senators, but
private television networks projected the governing party would win
48.6 percent and the Social Christians 26.3 percent in both houses.
   Perez first took office in 1974, the year after the Arab oil
embargo sent oil prices soaring, and nationalized the country's oil
industry.
   Imports were cheap, Venezuelans spent millions of dollars
traveling abroad, and employment figures increased as the government
invested in steel, aluminum and hydroelectric projects.
   But Perez was nearly impeached for his alleged involvement in
receiving kickbacks in the public purchase of a refrigerator ship,
the Sierra Nevada, and left office in disgrace despite his acquittal.
   Perez admitted that this time around he faces hard times and
possibly dissapointing a population that believes in his power to
reap prosperity.
   Venezuela depends on oil for 90 percent of its export earnings
and has seen those earnings slump dramatically in the last few years
with the fall in oil prices.
   Perez set as his first task renegotiating with reluctant foreign
banks _ mostly U.S. _ the nation's $33 billion debt, the
fourth-largest in Latin America after Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
   Perez believes he is the man to lead a Latin American drive to
set new terms on the regional debt crisis, and he promised to meet
other leaders on the continent to work out negotiations.
   Some of Perez's aides say the president-elect wants to double
Venezuela's repayment schedule from 14 to 30 years, at a fixed
interest rate.
   In addition, his aides say, he will look for new loans to paper
over a balance of payments deficit estimated this year at more than
$3 billion.
   Venezuela paid out more than 60 percent of its foreign earnings
for its debt this year. Perez said repayment of the debt under
present circumstances is ``obscene.''
   Getting new terms from creditors is crucial to Perez's plans to
deal with poverty levels that have soared in the wake of the fall of
oil prices at the beginning of the decade.
   Half of Venezuelan workers earn less than 5,000 bolivars (a
little more than $300) a month, according to the the Venezuelan
Workers Confederation, one of Perez's political strongholds. The
confederation says a family of five needs at least 6,000 bolivars
monthly for food alone.
   Almost half the population lives in sub-standard housing, mostly
neighborhoods of cardboard and plywood shacks ringing major cities.
   Officially, unemployment stands at 7 percent, although along with
the underemployed, the figure rises to about 50 percent, according
to the Workers Confederation.
   Voting is mandatory in Venezuela, but private projections
estimated that 15 percent of the 9 million eligible voters did not
cast ballots. A high abstention rate was widely predicted because of
general voter dissatisfaction with both major candidates.

   A dredger capsized and sank in stormy seas
off the Belgian coast early today, and two of the 10 crew members
were killed and another two were missing, the coast guard said.
   Six crew members were rescued and taken to hospitals in Belgium,
a Dover coast guard spokesman said. It was not immediately known if
any of them was injured.
   The Cardiff, Wales-registered Bowsprite turned back in rough
weather from a trip to the Belgian port of Nieuwpoort and was
heading for the English coast when it capsized about 25 miles west
of Zeebrugge, Belgium, the spokesman said.
   Dredgers often gather aggregate for construction materials from
sand banks in river channels or harbors.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition he not be identified, said a
Mayday call was received shortly after midnight saying the vessel
was breaking in half and that its crew was taking to life rafts.
   The British minesweeper Upton, carrying out routine duties off
the Belgian coast, took charge of a rescue operation involving a
British military Sea King helicopter, two Belgian helicopters and a
North Sea ferry, Pride of Bruges.
   Rescuers picked up six survivors and the bodies of two men, the
coast guard said.

<TEXT>
   Two women are seeking to block the
adoption of their dead sister's six children by a polygamist couple
despite a state social worker's finding that the polygamists are
``highly qualified'' to be parents.
   Attorneys were to begin presenting arguments today in the custody
case hinging on whether people who practice polygamy in violation of
Utah law can be considered proper candidates for adoption.
   The state Department of Social Services has an informal policy
that polygamy is a matter of religion rather than morals and is not
to be considered when social workers make recommendations in
adoption cases, officials say.
   ``We are dealing with children raised in a fundamentalist home
being adopted into a fundamentalist home,'' said Terry Twitchell, a
spokeswoman for the department. ``It's no different than a Jewish
child going to a Jewish home or a Mormon child going to a Mormon
home.''
   But the attorney for the women trying to block the adoption
contends the state policy endorses illegal behavior rather than
tolerating it.
   ``We're not talking about enforcement of bigamy statutes,'' said
the lawyer, Tim Anderson. ``We're not talking about the state
sitting on the fence. In this case, the state is an accomplice in
creating an illegal polygamist family relationship.''
   Vaughn and Sharane Fischer, of the polygamous southwestern Utah
community of Hildale, want to adopt the six children of Brenda
Thornton, a member of the community who died of cancer in August
1987.
   Thornton's children, who range from ages 5 to 19, have lived with
the Fischers the past 1{ years and are said to want to be adopted by
them. Thornton had left a previous polygamous marriage and became
Fischer's third wife two months before her death.
   Thornton signed a document surrendering her children to the
Fischers, and the children's biological father, Joseph Phil
Thornton, consented.
   But two of Brenda Thornton's sisters, Pat and Janet Johanson,
contend the state cannot award custody to parents who openly
practice polygamy and intend to teach those beliefs to their
children.
   Polygamy was sanctioned by the early Mormon church but was banned
before Utah was admitted to statehood. However, some fundamentalist
offshoots of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints still
believe in the practice.
   A home study by a state social worker recommends approval of the
adoptions, calling the Fischers ``highly qualified to take care of
these children'' and ``a good family for adoption.''
   The report mentions that Vaughn Fischer has another wife, Katrina
Stubbs, in addition to Sharane Fischer. But it does not evaluate the
relationship and makes no finding of their ``moral fitness'' to
adopt, as required by law.
   Anderson criticized that approach: ``When you or I go to adopt,
it (moral fitness) is dealt with in depth. The larger issue here is
why does the state have a policy that treats the claims of religious
fundamentalists differently than you or I or anyone else?''
   Jean Nielsen, director of the Division of Family Services, said
the overriding factor is the best interests of the children.
   ``That is why an alternative lifestyle does not rule out someone
from being an adoptive parent,'' she said.
   But if that lifestyle is illegal? ``Then it's probably not in the
best interests of the child,'' she said.
   ``Polygamy is a crime,'' said Steven Snow, an attorney
representing the Fischers. ``But so is adultery and fornication, and
those laws are not enforced either. There are matters far more
important in this case than religious lifestyle.''

   Santa will be getting gifts this
Christmas instead of giving them.
   Rather than spending money to exchange presents among themselves,
pupils at Mountain Lake Elementary School are making donations to
help pay Elmer Buller's medical expenses.
   Buller, who has played Santa in the community 100 miles southwest
of Minneapolis for at least 20 years, was burned over 25 percent of
his body on Nov. 21 when he slipped into a pit of burning coals at
Balzer Manufacturing, a farm implement plant where he is a custodian.
   Buller, 60, is in intensive care in the burn unit at St.
Paul-Ramsey Medical Center in St. Paul and is expected to be
hospitalized for a month. The burns are mostly on his legs and hands.
   Every year, Buller donned his red Santa suit for an annual visit
to the city park, arriving in a sleigh or behind a team of horses.
But he didn't stop there. He would pop up all over town in costume,
greeting travelers and distributing candy.
   ``He was such a natural,'' said Ardelle Neufeld, office secretary
for the Chamber of Commerce. ``Everybody in Mountain Lake knew it
had to be Elmer (to play the community's Santa).''
   Elmer's wife, Rubie, said the outpouring of care from the
community since the accident has been tremendous. And she said Elmer
will miss playing Santa this year.
   ``He'll miss the kids,'' she said.

   A cache of unmounted gems, jewelry and watches
found in the hollow bottom of a filing cabinet in the late Andy
Warhol's townhouse brought $1.64 million at auction, according to
Sotheby's.
   The highest price paid at Sunday's auction was for a 7.8 carat
diamond ring, bought for $198,000 by an anonymous dealer, said Sealy
Rodger, a spokeswoman for the auction house.
   A 1940s bracelet of platinum, rock crystal, diamonds, emeralds,
rubies and sapphires sold to a New York dealer for $46,200, she said.
   The cache was discovered in June when two curators of the Andy
Warhol Foundation were preparing to move two filing cabinets, which
were stacked on top of each other and used to store drawings and
prints.
   When the curators removed the bottom drawers to make the cabinet
lighter, they found dozens of unmounted gems, jewelry and watches in
a hollow bottom of the top cabinet. Some of the items were loose,
others were in paper bags, jewelry boxes and plastic bags.
   Their estimated value of more than $1.2 million was double the
estimate for Warhol's jewelry and watches that were sold this spring.
   Other top lots Sunday included an emerald and diamond bracelet,
which sold for $44,000; a 15.75 carat diamond ring for $40,700; a
gold oval Cartier watch for $37,400, and a necklace of gold,
diamonds, rubies and nephrite carved into a mask, for $35,200.
   About 400 people attended the auction, which benefited the Andy
Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

<TEXT>
   Fog blanketed the Pacific Northwest and snow fell in parts of New
England, but skies were clear in much of the nation early today as a
quiet weather pattern that has dominated the nation the last six
days continued.
   The main storm track ran northward along western Canada before
dipping south across the upper Mississippi Valley and the
mid-Atlantic region.
   Northwest winds crossing the eastern Great Lakes produced widely
scattered snow showers in parts of New York state and central New
England late Sunday evening. Two inches of snow fell at Syracuse,
N.Y. Snowfall ranged from a trace to 4 inches across Vermont. One to
three inches of snow was measured in parts of southern New Hampshire.
   Once again dense fog was covering much of the Pacific Northwest
and the central California valleys. The Boise, Idaho, Aiport was
closed Sunday afternoon because of dense fog.
   The nation's high Sunday afternoon was 86 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif.
   Today's forecast called for snow showers in the Great Lakes
region. An upper air disturbance moving into the Pacific Northwest
was expected to produce rain in western Washington state.
   Much of the nation was to have fair skies because of a large area
of high pressure over the south-central portion of the nation.
   Foggy conditions were expected in valley areas of the northern
and central Pacific Coast.
   Predicted highs: below 20 in northern Maine; 20s in the rest of
northern New England and northeast New York state; 30s and 40s in
eastern parts of the northern Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley,
the Great Lakes states, the central Appalachians and southern New
England, and the northern Rockies; 70s in south Texas, the southern
Florida peninsula, Southern California and the desert Southwest.
   The rest of the nation was expected to have highs in the 50s and
60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 66 at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>People: Collins' and Costner Among Best Dressed; Bush's Look is
Boring</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS final graf to CORRECT `bearing' to `baring'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kevin Costner got rave reviews in his bomber
jacket, Joan Collins's bare-shoulder look was ``fabulous, elegant,
lovely,'' and Britain's Prince William got a nod of approval for the
little pleats on his pants.
   The three were among the celebrities listed by People magazine as
the year's best-dressed.
   This week's People also gave worst-dressed citations. George Bush
was among them because his suit and tie were ``boring.'' Elton John
was cited for a ladylike hat, and William's mother, Princess Diana,
for her blue jean and T-shirt combo.
   Talk show host Morton Downey Jr., one of seven judges, said he is
``sick of royalty that tries to look like common folk.''
   Also judging the fashion coups and boo-boos of 1988 were Olympic
track star Florence Griffith Joyner, TV's extraterrestrial ALF,
country singer Tanya Tucker and designers Vivienne Westwood, Victor
Costa and Kenneth Cole.
   Mary Tyler Moore, wrapped in a floor-length gown, was declared
``terribly pretty'' by Westwood. Cole called Barbra Steisand ``a
beautiful woman with a lot of style.''
   Costa said of Corbin Bernsen, ``You couldn't look any better than
that,'' and cooed that Audrey Hepburn was ``impeccable, fantastic''
in a draped number of polka dots and stripes.
   Joyner, however, said, ``I would only buy something like this if
I could get my money back after I wore it.''
   The track star herself was among those judged, and her
stretch-lace racing tights did not win a gold medal. ``Is this the
Olympics or the Folies-Bergeres?'' Downey wondered. Costa said the
tights made her look like a Playboy bunny.
   Lauren Hutton, too, didn't fare well. Her floral mini by French
designer Christian Lacroix inspired Cole to say, ``She is a
remarkable woman wearing a remarkable dress that should be worn by
someone else.''
   Madonna, Cybill Shepherd, Raquel Welch and tennis star Andre
Agassi also joined Bush as the year's worst dressed. Of the
president-elect, Tucker said, ``What can you do with this guy?''
   ALF said of the navel-baring get-up Cher wore at the Academy
Awards, ``She has finally found a way to stay off the worst-dressed
lists: not wearing clothes.''

<HEAD>Romer Calls Nuclear Weapons Plant Safe But Renews Threat To Close
It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS SEARLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Roy Romer said storage sites for radioactive
wastes at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant are secure, but he
renewed his threat to close the plant if the federal government
fails to find other storage sites.
   ``I'm saying to the federal government, `Get off your duff _
let's go, let's get a solution,''' the Colorado governor said Sunday
after touring the plant.
   Waste has been collecting in boxcars and in enclosed facilities
at the plant since October when Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus barred them
from entering his state for disposal.
   Romer said he did not want to have to carry out his threat to
force the closure of the plant, which uses plutonium to make
triggers for nuclear bombs, when it reaches storage capacity in
March or April. The plant, about 16 miles northwest of Denver,
employs about 6,000 people.
   A permanent federal disposal site is under construction near
Carlsbad, N.M., but is not expected to be ready until June at the
earliest.
   Romer and other Western governors are to meet with Department of
Energy officials Dec. 16 to discuss the waste storage problem.
   Romer said one temporary solution he will suggest then is that
the storage boxcars be placed in non-populated areas, such as
military bases, under guard. He said he might suggest that
``everybody take three cars and keep them three months'' to give the
federal government a little more leeway.
   Romer said the workers he spoke with at the plant feel
comfortable with their safety measures, but he said the storage
sites could threaten groundwater supplies for neighboring
municipalities.
   The 385-acre plant is surrounded by a 6,500-acre, federally owned
buffer zone, but studies showing higher cancer rates and plutonium
contamination have led to promises of an expensive cleanup.
   Romer said Rocky Flats officials assured him that $20 million
would be spent cleaning up the most contaminated storage sites at
the plant in the next fiscal year.
   Waste disposal is one of many problems that have beset the Energy
Department's nuclear weapons facilities across the country. Four
have been partly closed, virtually halting atomic arms production.

<HEAD>Jersey City Mayor Returns With Wife's Body; Says He'll Go Back To
Peru</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jersey City Mayor Anthony Cucci says he's
ready to get on with his work despite grief over his wife's death in
a Peruvian train accident blamed on sabotage.
   ``I suffered a loss, a great, great loss. I loved her very
much,'' Cucci said of his wife, whom he married in 1985, 11 days
after his election.
   The mayor, who was also injured, arrived with Anna Cucci's body
at Newark International Airport Sunday evening. Mrs. Cucci, 62, will
be buried Wednesday.
   Cucci, 66, said he would be back at City Hall today.
   ``I still have my job to complete,'' he said.
   He also said he thought his wife would have liked him to run for
re-election, but he would decide that later.
   ``If I know Annie, she would have said, `Get out there and do it
again,''' he said.
   Cucci, who was wheeled off the plane in a wheelchair, moved
slowly and stiffly and said he felt ``kind of sore.''
   ``I'm feeling very lucky,'' he said. ``I don't have any internal
injuries.''
   Mrs. Cucci died Thursday when the train she was riding with her
husband and Cuzco city officials derailed on its way to the Inca
ruins of Machupicchu and plunged into a ravine.
   Doris Chacon, the 58-year-old wife of Cuzco Mayor Carlos Chacon,
also was killed. Mayor Chacon suffered multiple fractures and
underwent major surgery.
   Peruvian authorities said the accident was caused by sabotage.
They said it may have been connected to either guerrillas of the
left-wing Maoist Shining Path group or a nationwide labor strike.
   Cucci said he received a warm reception from the Peruvian people
and ``I have no cause to believe there was foul play,'' in the
accident. ``I don't condemn Peru. ... Those few (bad people) will be
weeded out.''
   The New Jersey delegation traveled to Cuzco to sign a
sister-cities agreement to promote cultural, scientific and artistic
exchanges.
   The agreement was signed despite the accident.
   ``It didn't dampen my spirit for a sister city,'' Cucci said.
``I'm going back.''

   The dollar was lower in early European trading
today and currency dealers said they expect little movement during a
week in which no economic indicators are scheduled to be released.
Gold prices rose as much as $6.45 an ounce.
   Traders said volume has already fallen to its traditional slim
year-end levels.
   ``The general market view is bearish, but if you talk to people
in the dealing rooms, you can hear many different opinions,'' said
one dealer at a West German bank in Frankfurt.
   ``The situation is fairly confused, and since we don't expect any
figures this week, we'll probably stay in a (narrow trading) range.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar slipped 0.11 yen to close at 121.53 yen on reports that
Emperor Hirohito's condition had worsened, dealers said. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 121.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.7224 West German marks, down from 1.7315
   _1.4425 Swiss francs, down from 1.4598
   _5.8835 French francs, down from 5.9200

   _1,273.75 Italian lire, down from 1,279.50
   _1.1845 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1869
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8713, more than 1 cent more
expensive for buyers than late Friday's $1.8597.
   Gold prices were sharply higher in Europe. Gold surged in New
York on Friday in the wake of another surge in platinum prices.
   The metal opened in London at a bid price of $429.80 a troy
ounce, up from $425.50 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $430.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $430.75, up from $424.30 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 86 cents to close at a bid
$429.94.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.20 a troy ounce,
up from Friday's $6.13.

<HEAD>A Revival of Thornton Wilder's `Our Town' on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs at end with additional reviews; no pickup. No PMs
planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years after it first arrived on Broadway,
Thornton Wilder's ``Our Town'' remains an unexpectedly vibrant,
often surprising, piece of theater.
   That's pretty amazing considering how well-known the play is.
There probably isn't a drama club, high school, college playhouse or
community theater where the story of life in Grover's Corners, N.H.,
hasn't been told.
   That sense of vibrancy permeates a sterling new production of
``Our Town.'' It's the work of the Lincoln Center Theater company
which opened the play Sunday at Broadway's Lyceum Theater. The
darkly burnished revival, directed by the company's artistic guru
Gregory Mosher, is straightforward and unsentimental, but it doesn't
sacrifice honest emotion.
   ``Our Town'' is a meditation on life, quite serious and even
somber, particularly in its third act when it deals with life after
death. But that's not what most people remember about the play.
Usually it's bathed in nostalgia for the past, an uncomplicated
turn-of-the century America where people didn't lock their doors at
night, where the milkman still delivered milk to your doorstep and
where young lovers could get engaged over a strawberry phosphate at
the local drug store.
   Those details are in this production but that's just what they
are _ only details in the larger story of life. ``In our town, we
like to know the facts about everybody,'' says the stage manager,
the nameless narrator who tells the story of Grover's Corners and
the people who live there. It's these facts _ pleasant and
unpleasant _ that make the picture whole.
   Wilder divides his play into three acts. The first, called
``Daily Life,'' introduces the characters of ``Our Town,''
particularly the Gibbs and Webb families. It's their children _
George Gibbs and Emily Webb _ who marry and whose story becomes the
second act, ``Love and Marriage.''
   There's no title for Act III. ``I reckon you can guess what
that's about,'' says the stage manager. It deals with death,
specifically Emily's death in childbirth. The scenes are played
simply yet the sparseness of the emotion makes it all the more
affecting.
   Mosher has been fastidious in his casting of the large company,
nearly 30 actors in all. The narrator is playe here by Spalding
Gray. Gray, best known as the author and star of his own monologues
including ``Swimming to Cambodia,'' is a sardonic storyteller.
There's an edge to his performance that slices the sweetness of some
of the events happening on stage.
   Penelope Ann Miller and Eric Stoltz turn the sometimes cloying
young lovers into believable human beings. Miss Miller, in
particular, handles the transition from innocence to experience with
a touching directness.
   Frances Conroy, James Rebhorn, Roberta Maxwell and Peter Maloney
are fine as the quartet of parents, offering individual portraits in
roles that are often considered no more than supporting. Miss Conroy
is eerily effective as the other worldly Mrs. Gibbs who loses all
interest in what was her life after she has ``passed on.''
   Mosher also gets strong support from an excellent production
team. Jane Greenwood's costumes are stylish yet subdued,
monochromatic outfits that don't call attention to themselves yet
seem exactly right. Equally commendable is Kevin Rigdon's sensitive
lighting and Douglas Stein's few chairs and tables strewn across a
bare playing area.
   There's a magical, almost mystical, quality to this production of
``Our Town.'' Maybe that's because it's performed on the large empty
stage of a Broadway theater. Intricate patterns of pipes cover the
back brick wall of the Lyceum and an enormous system of lights seems
to climb to the sky.
   It's a haunting environment for a haunting production, told with
a style and simplicity that reconfirms ``Our Town's'' reputation as
an American classic.
   In other reviews, The New York Times' Frank Rich pointed to ``one
major casting miscalculation, Spalding Gray's flip Stage Manager,
that constantly disrupts the fragile text, the firm staging and the
otherwise well-chosen cast. ... The attempt, through Mr. Gray, to
turn the playwright into something he's not derails Mr. Mosher's
`Our Town.'
   ``While it would no doubt be sickening to see a Stage Manager
resembling the lovable old codgers in wine-cooler commercials, Mr.
Gray swings too far the other way, presenting the narrator as if he
were a narcissistic new-wave raconteur exactly matching the
storyteller in his own autobiographical performance pieces.''
   Clive Barnes of the New York Post wrote: ``Gray is altogether too
contemporary and too removed from the Middle America of the first
decades of the century. ... What makes the version glow _ and what
will forever be remembered about it _ are the two young people ...
These two lit up the stage with truth, honesty and unexpected
tragedy as a village Romeo and Juliet.''
   And Howard Kissel wrote in the Daily News: ``The tone of Gregory
Mosher's production, though full of lively ideas, often seems too
casual. It misses the gravity of turn-of-the-century life, when
grownups felt compelled to act as such. ... But the play is
actor-proof, even non-actor-proof, since Spalding Gray as the Stage
Manager confirms my feeling that avante-garde performers are not
really actors.''

   Two commuter aircraft made emergency landings
within minutes of each other at Stapleton International Airport
after landing gear problems forced them to turn back shortly after
takeoff, airport officials said.
   Both landings went smoothly Sunday and there were no injuries
among the more than 90 people on the flights.
   Rocky Mountain Airways Flight 2178 took off for Steamboat Springs
at 4 p.m. with 43 people on board, but turned back after a warning
light concerning the landing gear came on, said airline spokeswoman
Rita Cuddihy.
   The DeHavilland-7, four-engine turboprop circled Denver to use up
fuel while airport emergency crews moved into place, said Stapleton
spokesman Norm Avery.
   The plane landed safely about 5:45 p.m., Cuddihy said.
   ``They were able to get the gear down and locked, but the (nose)
wheel was cocked to the left. When they landed, the wheel
immediately straightened out,'' she said. The passengers were
transferred to another plane, she said.
   Within a half-hour of the landing, United Express Flight 3939
returned to Stapleton with about 50 people on board, Avery said,
calling the landing ``precautionary.''
   The crew radioed the control tower with ``unknown gear problems''
after taking off for Grand Junction, Avery said.
   Because of the previous landing, ``the emergency equipment was
already in place,'' he said.
   Avery didn't know what kind of plane the United Airlines commuter
service was using, and United Express personnel reached at home had
no information on the flight.

<HEAD>Talks Derailed Just As Agreement To Be Signed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks to sign a protocol on
peace for Angola and South-West Africa could resume this week,
despite South Africa's sudden exit from peace talks, Foreign
Minister Pik Botha was quoted as saying.
   Cuban, Angolan and Congolese officials were reported angry,
disillusioned and embarrassed by the departure Saturday night of
Botha and the South African delegation following four days of talks
in Congo.
   The session produced no signed agreement on a procedure for
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola and implementation of
an independence plan for South-West Africa, which is ruled by South
Africa.
   But Botha sounded optimistic Sunday in interviews reported by the
independent South African Press Association and the government-run
Radio South Africa.
   ``The process is irreversible,'' he said. ``We continue to
progress step-by-step.'' The radio quoted him as saying the talks
``could be resumed within a few days'' and a protocol ``signing is
still a possibility.''
   SAPA reported that the South African decision to leave was made
by President P.W. Botha, who had been sent a copy of a draft
protocol but apparently wanted further discussions.
   SAPA quoted the foreign minister, who is not related to the
president, as saying the talks in Brazzaville resulted in some
progress but the Cabinet needed time to assess the situation.
   Cuba's vice-minister for foreign affairs, Ricardo de Quesada,
said, ``If the South Africans were truly for peace in Angola and
independence in Namibia, they would not have employed this
diplomatic ruse.'' Namibia is another name for South-West Africa.
   De Quesada said in Brazzaville that the diplomats had been so
close to agreement the text had already been typed, and he said the
South Africans ``insulted everyone.''
   The major stumbling block for the South Africans is the method
for verifying that the Cuban troops, which have been supporting the
Marxist government in Angola since 1976, withdraw according to an
agreed schedule.
   Their departure from southern Africa is a necessity, as far as
South Africa is concerned, because of fears that their presence
might favor a takeover in South-West Africa by the South-West
African People's Organization.
   That group has been fighting more than two decades against South
African control of South-West Africa.

   The case of the Yugoslavian consul general
who faces money laundering charges may hinge on a judge's ruling
about diplomatic immunity.
   Defense attorneys said they plan to raise the issue at a pretrial
hearing, but prosecutors maintained Sunday that Bahrudin Bijedic
lacks the broad immunity protecting diplomats.
   Bijedic has no diplomatic immunity from these charges because he
is a consul, Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Sarmousakis said. He said
diplomats are covered by a treaty that gives them broader immunity,
but consuls, who are named by a country to foster the interests of
its citizens and businesses in a foreign city, can be prosecuted for
offenses that occur outside their official duties.
   Bijedic, the consul general to Chicago, was indicted Thursday
with four other men. He pleaded innocent Sunday before a federal
magistrate and was released to the Yugoslavian acting ambassador on
$150,000 bail. LBS Bank of New York Inc., the U.S. branch of a
Yugoslavian bank, was also indicted.
   ``I expect an apology from the U.S. mass media,'' Bijedic said to
reporters shortly after his arraignment. ``I never violated any
American law.''
   Bijedic was arrested as the result of a U.S. Customs Service
sting operation that tracked at least eight alleged transactions
totaling nearly $1.5 million.
   The defendants are accused of taking cash given to them by
undercover agents out of the country, depositing it in foreign
accounts and wiring the money back to U.S. banks under the names of
phony corporations to hide the money's origin.
   In one instance, Bijedic provided the others with diplomatic
stickers that barred U.S. officials from opening the packages of
money, according to the 21-count indictment.
   Vladimir Matic, Yugoslavian charge d'affaires at the embassy in
Washington, accepted responsibility for Bijedic and assured the
court he will appear for future proceedings. Matic was acting as
ambassador because the chief Yugoslavian representative was not in
the country, U.S. officials said.
   U.S. Magistrate Tullio Leomporra said if Bijedic fled
prosecution, Matic would be imprisoned and forced to pay the bail.
Matic accepted the terms.
   Michael Goode, Bijedic's attorney from Chicago, said it is too
soon to predict what kind of defense will be used. But he said he
would raise the issue of diplomatic immunity.
   Bijedic was released by a federal judge to customs agents and
brought to Philadelphia for the hearing Friday.
   During the proceedings, Goode said he and Bijedic returned to his
hotel room from breakfast early Sunday to find customs agents
rifling the man's belongings looking for documents.
   Several of the documents were placed in a sealed envelope, but
Goode argued the search was a violation of Bijedic's Fourth
Amendment rights.
   The documents will remain in the sealed envelope in the
possession of prosecutors until the challenge can be made at future
hearing before the trial judge assigned to the case, Leomporra said.
   All five men named in the indictment were charged with violating
currency reporting laws, the arms export and control act, and
conspiracy, customs officials said.
   Indicted along with Bijedic, 52, were Vjekoslov Spanjol, 31, a
naturalized U.S. citizen from Texas; Vinko Mir, 54, chairman of LBS
Bank; Hubert Francis Cole, 44, of Carrollton, Texas; and Larry Card,
50, of Chattanooga, Tenn.

   A panic provoked by a false alarm that a
Yaounde school was about to collapse left 34 people dead today and
at least 50 injured, an official at the U.S. Embassy said.
   Cameroon authorities were trying to determine what started the
panic at the Institut Jean Monthe, a private secondary school
located in a marshy area in the heart of the West African capital,
said Gemuh Akuchu, a spokesman for the embassy.
   About 10,000 students between the ages of 12 and 16 attend the
school.
   According to first reports from the scene, a confrontation about
9:30 a.m. between a student and teacher on the ground floor provoked
a wave of shouting by students that was interpreted by others
upstairs as a warning that the old building was about to collapse.
   In the panic, students rushed down an open staircase in the
five-story structure toward the only entrance. Akuchu said some of
those killed apparently fell off the staircase, others jumped out
windows on the upper floors and some were crushed underfoot in the
stampede to the door.
   The French news agency Agence-France Presse, quoting unnamed
hospital sources, reported that at least 50 young people had been
taken to the local hospital.
   Parents rushed to the scene, complicating the work of emergency
teams and ambulances caring for the injured.
   A spokesman for President Paul Biya said he also was expected at
the scene.

<TEXT>
   The pre-dawn earthquake that jarred
slumbering Southern Californians involved a fault that caused a
deadly aftershock a year ago but was of a different type than the
previous temblor.
   Saturday's quake, which measured 5.0 on the Richter scale, was
centered 10 miles beneath City Hall where the Raymond Hill Fault
intersects an unnamed fault discovered after it caused a
5.3-magnitude aftershock of the Whittier Narrows quake last year,
said Kate Hutton, a seismologist at the California Institute of
Technology.
   ``Because it is an intersection of two faults, it's been
difficult to tell which one caused the earthquake,'' she said.
   The latest temblor was a ``strike-slip'' quake in which two
plates grind against each other to move the ground horizontally, Ms.
Hutton said.
   It contrasted with the vertical motion of the ``surge'' quakes
that marked the 5.9-magnitude Whittier temblor on Oct. 1, 1987. That
quake and its aftershock caused eight deaths and an estimated $358
million in damage in metropolitan Los Angeles.
   Saturday's 3:38 a.m. quake rattled windows, knocked items off
store shelves and caused at least 32 minor injuries, mostly bumps
and bruises suffered when people tripped or ducked for cover,
authorities said.
   A 36-year-old Burbank man shot himself in the foot when he
mistook rattling windows for an intruder, and an 80-year-old Atwater
woman fell and broke her hip, nursing supervisors said.
   Authorities found no damage to City Hall or the 66-year-old,
100,000-seat Rose Bowl, said Fire Capt. Duncan Baird. The most
damage appeared to be at the 200-year-old San Gabriel Mission, which
lost a few bricks, police in San Gabriel said.

   An East German musician in Japan with a Berlin
orchestra has defected after seeking asylum at the West German
Embassy in Tokyo, a Foreign Ministry official said today.
   Gerhard Gobel, 43, a violist with the Berlin Radio Symphony
Orchestra, arrived in West Germany today after leaving Japan on a
Lufthansa flight Sunday evening, said the Japanese official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Since Gobel is a musician, there are no special political
motives for the defection,'' the official said, without elaborating.
   According to Kyodo News Service, Gobel did not show up for the
orchestra's Saturday night performance in Kofu, 68 miles west of
Tokyo.
   Instead, he went to the West German Embassy in Tokyo and asked
for asylum. Embassy officials refused to comment.
   His absence was noticed when the orchestra arrived in Hiroshima,
429 miles southwest of Tokyo, on Saturday, Kyodo said.
   The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra arrived in Japan on Nov. 30
and is scheduled to perform in six Japanese cities before leaving
Dec. 19.
   In November, four East Germans on tour with a chorus from Dresden
also were granted asylum at the West German Embassy in Tokyo.

   The foreign affairs chief of the African
National Congress of South Africa has died in the Zambian capital,
the ANC reported today.
   Former teacher Johnny Makatini died of natural causes, the ANC
reported from its headquarters in Lusaka.
   Makatini, who was in his 60s, was known to suffer from diabetes.
   He was opposed to the South African Communist Party which sought
to dominate the ANC, the main guerrilla group fighting for black
majority rule in South Africa.
   His death opens the way for more radical elements in the ANC,
which is outlawed in South Africa but active in neighboring states.

   Four bombs exploded early today in the
capital, damaging two political party offices and a car belonging to
a conservative politician, police said.
   The blasts, which occurred at 20-minute intervals, caused some
property damage but no injuries, said a police spokesman speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The left-wing terrorist group Social Resistance claimed
responsibility for the explosions in a telephone call to the
left-wing daily Eleftherotypia.
   The police spokesman said the first bomb went off outside the
office of Nikos Anagnostopoulos, a parliamentarian with the main
conservative opposition party New Democracy.
   The second bomb went off outside Anagnostopoulos' apartment,
located in the same building as his office, the police spokesman
said.
   The next shattered windows in a nearby office of the governing
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, he said.
   The fourth bomb damaged the car of New Democracy parliamentarian
Athanassios Kanellopoulos, parked outside his home.
   Social Resistance emerged for the first time Nov. 16 when it
claimed responsibility for blasts outside the office of New
Democracy deputy Stephanos Manos and outside an apartment owned by
Yannis Latsis, a Greek industrialist.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service has added extra cargo planes
connecting 10 major cities to speed the flow of mail during the
Christmas season, Postmaster General Anthony Frank reported today.
   The special package service will operate through Dec. 24, using
Terre Haute, Ind., as a hub, according to agency officials.
   The Postal Service regularly operates a fleet of 23 aircraft
through its Terre Haute hub in the early hours of each morning; the
special Christmas service will add daytime flights to help cope with
the pre-holiday crush.
   Frank said in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''
that the Postal Service is expecting a deluge of mail Dec. 19 and
urged Americans to send their cards and packages before that.
   ``Everybody's going to try to mail on the 19th, he said. But, all
in all, even in the last week, we'll be able to handle it.''
   The supplemental air transport system will begin Dec. 10 and
connect New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Boston,
Atlanta, Detroit, Denver, Seattle and Pittsburgh.
   Frank was said he does not expect an increase in postage rates
for at least two years.
   He has said several times in the past that the agency is likely
to begin the complex process of raising rates in 1990, with an
increase expected in 1991.

<TEXT>
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi pointed a gun
at the head of a U.S. serviceman during the 1985 TWA hijacking and
said ``We kill Marines,'' according to testimony at the confessed
hijacker's trial today.
   Kenneth Bowen, 26, a civil engineering student who was a hostage
on the TWA jet, testified that Hamadi dragged him to the first-class
section of the hijacked airliner to question him.
   ``Hamadi grabbed me by my hair and pulled me to the first-class
section,'' Bowen testified. ``He had a gun in his hand and asked me
if I was a Marine.
   ``I said I was a sailor,'' Bowen said. ``He said `We kill
Marines.'''
   He said Hamadi spoke to him in broken English.
   During the exchange, Bowen said, he and Hamadi ``were face to
face and he had the pistol pointed at my face saying `you Marine, we
kill Marine.'''
   ``He (Hamadi) indicated that if I didn't cooperate, he would
shoot me,'' Bowen said.
   Bowen told the court he was a member of a team of U.S. Navy
divers traveling aboard the Athens-to-Rome flight when it was
hijacked in June 1985. He said he had been a close friend of Robert
Stethem, the Navy diver who was shot and killed by one of the
hijackers.
   Previous witnesses have testified that the hijackers apparently
mistook the divers for U.S. Marines.
   Stethem was the only fatality during the ordeal, during which 39
Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking, but has denied
shooting Stethem. He is being tried on murder and air piracy charges
in a heavily guarded Frankfurt courtroom.
   Choking back tears, Bowen described the events surrounding
Stethem's murder.
   ``I heard some commotion in the front of the plane. I thought I
heard a door open. There was a muffled shot and sounds of a person
moaning,'' Bowen said. He said he did not see who shot Stethem.
   Bowen, who was discharged from active Navy service in 1985, also
told the court he believed Hamadi was the leader of the hijackers.
   ``Hamadi had the gun most of the time and he made most of the
decisions,'' Bowen said.
   Under court guidelines to protect witnesses, Bowen was not asked
to give his current residence. Court records indicate that at the
time of the hijacking, his address was listed as St. Petersburg, Fla.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   His older brother, Abbas Ali Hamadi, is serving a 13-year prison
sentence in West Germany after being convicted of helping to kidnap
two West Germans in Beirut in an effort to win release of his
brother.
   The West German hostages have since been released.

   Thousands of Protestants and
Roman Catholics joined a peace march by torchlight to appeal for an
end to nearly 20 years of sectarian violence.
   Police said an estimated 8,000 people took part in the Sunday
night rally. Northern Ireland's four main churches organized the
procession through Belfast, which ended with Christmas carol singing
in the rain.
   Organizers said it was the first peace demonstration jointly
organized by the Catholic, Protestant, Methodist and Presbyterian
churches since violence began in the British province in 1969.
   ``For so many people to get up out of their armchairs on a night
such as this shows they want peace,'' said the Rev. Cahal Daly, the
Catholic bishop of Down and Conor.
   The bishop of the Protestant Church of Ireland, the Rev. Samuel
Poyntz, said: ``Better times for our city will come through prayer
and praise, not through protest and provocation.''
   Guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army have been waging a
violent campaign to end British rule in the province and unite it
with the Irish Republic.
   Almost 2,000 people have been killed in sectarian violence since
1969.

<HEAD>Body Of One Of Five Victims Found Along Highways Identified</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have identified one of the
five young women killed and dumped along highways in southeastern
Massachusetts in what police believe was the work of a serial killer
or killers.
   The body of Dawn Mendes, 25, of New Bedford was identified
Saturday by pathologists, said Bristol County District Attorney
Ronald A. Pina. She had been reported missing Sept. 10 from this
port town, near where the remains of five women have been found
since July in the brush just off Interstate 195 and Route 140.
   Pina said Mendes had a 5-year-old son and a record of arrests,
but he would not say what the arrests were for.
   Authorities said the investigation will try to trace backward
from the time Mendes was reported missing. Her body was the fourth
to be found.
   State police using trained dogs were to resume a search for more
victims and other evidence today.
   Mendes' remains were found Tuesday along the Reed Road exit ramp
on I-195. The third body was discovered Nov. 8 off the same ramp on
the other side of the the highway, not far from where the second
body was found in July.
   An autopsy was performed Friday on the fifth body, which was
found Thursday in nearby Freetown along Route 140, three miles south
of where the first body was found July 3.
   On Friday, Pina linked the victims to several women reported
missing in recent months from Weld Square, known by police as a
center of drug dealing and prostitution in this fishing port of
98,000 people about 50 miles south of Boston. There have been
reports of abductions from the red-light district in recent months.
   Pina said Friday that one of the victims was strangled. The cause
of death of some of the others had been determined but he would not
disclose the results.
   The remains of all five women will be examined by the FBI to more
accurately determine the cause of death and other details,
authorities said.

   Searchers recovered hundreds of bodies
from the Bay of Bengal and coastal mangrove swamps, but thousands of
people remained missing nearly a week after a cyclone hit India and
Bangladesh.
   Indian officials said 500 people died there, while the count in
Bangladesh varied widely.
   The government news agency of Bangladesh said 1,389 people were
killed by the storm, but the state-owned Bangladesh Times newspaper
said 1,500 died. The independent newspaper Inqilab maintained the
5,500 people died.
   The Red Crescent Society said its count stood at 1,150 but it had
not been updated since Sunday.
   The Bangladesh Times said 353 bodies were recovered Sunday from
the Bay of Bengal and mangrove swamps at the Sunderbans forest in
southwestern Bangladesh.
   Between 3,000 and 5,000 people have been missing since the
cyclone hit Tuesday night, according to officials and newspapers.
   Retired army Maj. Ziauddin, president of the fisherman's
association for a strip of coastal river delta land called Dublar
Char, said 5,000 fishermen and 1,400 boats were unaccounted for.
   Ziauddin, who uses only one name, told a news conference in
Khulna that bodies of 200 other Dublar Char fishermen had been
found. It was not known if these were among the 353 bodies reported
recovered by The Bangladesh Times. Khulna is 85 miles southwest of
Dhaka.
   A Khulna official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
salvage vessels are removing about 70 sunken barges blocking the
major port of Mongla on the Pasur River 25 miles south of Khulna.
   The cyclone struck three months after a flood inundated
three-quarters of Bangladesh and killed 1,500 people.
   A cyclone in 1985 killed at least 10,000 people, and one in 1970
claimed at least 500,000 lives.

   Myrna Loy, the saucy Nora Charles of the ``Thin
Man'' movies, walked into the East Room with the aid of a cane.
   George Burns, whose wisecracks have delighted audiences from the
'30s to the '80s, walked with a White House aide holding each arm.
   They may not be as spry as they were in what President Reagan
called ``the glory days'' of Hollywood, but Ms. Loy, 83, and Burns,
92, were the toast of Washington Sunday night.
   Along with violinist Alexander Schneider, 80, producer Roger
Stevens, 78, and choreographer Alvin Ailey, 57, they were honored as
the 1988 recipients of Kennedy Center honors in the performing arts.
   ``As a performer, the lovely and mysterious Myrna Loy always
conveyed a sense of great ease and comfort, as though she were
possessed of answers to questions you never even knew you had
asked,'' Reagan said.
   The 77-year-old president matched wisecracks with Burns, saying,
``One thing I can't figure out is how George manages to appear with
Johnny Carson so often. I'm always in bed when he's on.''
   From the White House the celebration moved to the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts, where President-elect George Bush
joined those on the stage and in the audience in singing ``Auld Lang
Syne'' in honor of Reagan.
   The Kennedy Center honorees join 52 others who have received
similar recognition since the awards were instituted in 1978.
   The audience saw clips of Ms. Loy in films with Clark Gable,
Spencer Tracy, Frederic March and other leading men as well as the
``Thin Man'' series in which she played the brittle, witty spouse of
detective Nick Charles with William Powell.
   Actress Kathleen Turner pointed out that not only did President
Roosevelt say Ms. Loy was his favorite actress, but gangster John
Dillinger was watching one of her films, ``Manhattan Melodrama,''
when he was tracked down and killed by G-men in the Biograph Theater
in Chicago.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., delivered the salute to Stevens,
who was chairman of the board of trustees of the Kennedy Center from
1961 to 1988. Ushers, stagehands and ticket sellers trooped to the
stage to join such luminaries as actress Faye Dunaway and playwright
Edward Albee in paying tribute to the veteran theatrical producer.

   A 70-year-old retired librarian who has
worked against drug dealing received a car as a gift of appreciation
at a block party thrown on her behalf by neighbors, police,
politicians and community leaders.
   Police believe Dorothy Erb's own car was firebombed by drug
dealers last month. There have been no arrests.
   The used car, a gift from a Sunnyvale man who admired Erb's
courage, was presented to her during the party Saturday that drew
about 300 people.
   ``A show of support is what will help the fight against drug
dealers,'' said George Bollog, the car's donor, who lives in a
relatively crime-free area.
   ``It could happen in my neighborhood someday. There's no place
that's immune to it. It's our collective reaction that will fight
it.''
   Erb said she was ``flabbergasted'' by the outpouring of support
for her. ``With this car, I am in my glory.''
   Erb has lived in her East Oakland neighborhood of small, older
homes and rundown apartment buildings for eight years. She became
active in the area's Home Alert program after a sharp increase in
burglaries in the last 18 months.
   She routinely reports to police the license plate numbers of
motorists involved in suspicious activities, and is a block captain
for Home Alert.
   Police Lt. Fred Peoples said there has been heavy drug dealing in
the neighborhood.
   Erb was home alone on the night of Nov. 9 when she heard a
popping sound outside and discovered her car in flames.
   ``It is like being in the middle of a war,'' she said.
``Sometimes I feel frightened, but when you are in the middle of it
you're too busy to worry.''
   The mood of Saturday's block party was primarily festive, with
free hot dogs, balloons, a puppet show, punch and gospel music. But
there was an underlying element of fear nonetheless.
   ``At first I was scared to come,'' said Jean Lea. ``But now I
feel good.''
   Betita Coty said Erb is a good example for others: ``Dorothy is
my kind of woman, a woman who can stand up for righteousness.''
   Luiza Gonzalez, who lives in the apartment building where dealers
are known to frequent hallways, says she showed up because she wants
the illegal activity stopped.
   ``People have their rights and they don't have to live this
way,'' she said.

   Israeli troops shot and killed a 15-year-old
Palestinian girl today in a clash with stone-throwing schoolgirls in
a Gaza Strip refugee camp, witnesses and hospital officials said.
   Witnesses told Arab reporters that soldiers opened fire after
dozens of pupils at the Shati refugee camp threw stones at the
troops.One girl, identified as Asma Abu Obadah, died of a bullet
wound to the head, said officials at Shifa Hospital in nearby Gaza
City.
   A military spokesman said the army was checking the report.
   The girl is the 319th Palestinian killed in the Arab uprising
that began last Dec. 8. Most were killed by army gunfire. Eleven
Israelis also have been killed.
   At least eight Palestinians, most of them teen-agers, were shot
and wounded Sunday in scattered clashes in the West Bank and Gaza,
hospital officials said. The army said it also was checking the
reports.
   A top-ranking army official said Sunday that violence in the
Israeli-occupied territories was decreasing.
   ``In the struggle between civilian violence and security forces,
we see a gradual advantage ... of the Israeli security forces,''
Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, Israel's deputy chief of staff, said on Israel
radio.
   Barak said that plastic bullets restored army deterrence, so that
a soldier ``has a clear feeling that when he raises his weapon, the
activity he faces disperses immediately.''
   Israel's use of plastic bullets, which penetrate the body and may
even kill if fired from a short distance, has provoked international
criticism. Israel defends the bullets as an efficient means of riot
control.
   Barak spoke several hours before a hand grenade was hurled at an
Israeli bus in the West Bank town of Hebron. It exploded on the
road, causing no injuries or damage.
   In another development, an Israeli woman told the daily Jerusalem
Post that she witnessed a rampage by troops in the village of Beita
near Nablus on Nov. 19.
   The woman, Judith Green, was quoted as saying she was told later
by villagers that a soldier had killed a 12-year-old boy by shooting
him in the head at point-blank range, the Post said.
   The army reported Nov. 23 that a boy died of a bullet wound to
the head after being shot in a clash with soldiers in Beita on the
day Ms. Green claims to have witnessed the rampage.
   An army spokeswoman said today the death was under investigation.
   Ms. Green, described as an Israel-American architect, was quoted
as saying she was in the village to discuss aid to Palestinians when
she saw soldiers ``trotting and along the way smashing every window
they passed with their rifle butts.
   ``Several of them paused alongside a terrace wall and took stones
from it, throwing them at the houses, cars, windows and shutters,''
she told the Post.
   On Sunday, a U.S.-born immigrant was sentenced to three years in
prison for the shooting death of an Arab shepherd who brought his
sheep to graze near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Shilo, 18
miles north of Jerusalem.
   Israel Zeev, 38, originally from Chicago, was convicted of
manslaughter last week for the killing of Jude Abdallah Awad, 28.
Zeev shot the shepherd while on guard duty in May.
   It was the first time a Jewish civilian was convicted in the
death of an Arab since the start of the uprising. Zeev also was
convicted for shooting and seriously injuring a second Arab.
   Zeev also was given a two-year suspended sentence and ordered to
pay the dead Arab's family $17,500 in compensation.

   The government claimed victory in
a four-day military revolt, but armed renegade troops today remained
inside an army post. A second rebel garrison surrendered to
government troops early today, the official news agency reported.
   Four people were reported killed in the rebellion, the most
serious threat to President Raul Alfonsin's civilian government
since it replaced a disgraced military dictatorship five years ago.
   The private news agency Noticias Argentinas said Gen. Isidro
Caceres planned to go to the rebel garrison on the outskirts of the
capital to disarm troops loyal to Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin.
   Seineldin surrendered at the garrison in Villa Martelli on
Sunday, ending the military crisis.
   It was not immediately known how many troops remained inside the
garrison.
   The revolt began Thursday when 53 members of an elite coast guard
unit rebelled. They joined an estimated 500 rebels, who took over
part of the suburban Campo de Mayo base Friday. The rebels moved to
Villa Martelli a day later.
   Troops at a second rebel garrison, the 6th mechanized infantry
regiment in Mercedes, 60 miles east of the capital, laid down their
arms early today, the official news agency Telam said.
   Telam said the commander of the Mercedes group, Maj. Hugo
Reinaldo Abete, told his troops to lay down their arms following
Seineldin's surrender.
   Despite the arrest of their leader, the rebels refused to concede
defeat late Sunday.
   ``We don't use the word `surrender;' we use the term
`negotiation,''' one of Seineldin's followers, Maj. Luis Alberto
Brun, was quoted as saying in an interview with the independent news
agency Noticias Argentinas.
   Brun said they were being allowed to return to their regiments.
   President Raul Alfonsin said Sunday that no concessions were made
to obtain Seineldin's surrender.
   ``This has been a really important success,'' he told reporters.
``There were no concessions of any kind.''
   It was the third such insurrection in 18 months.
   More than 40 civilians and police were hospitalized with wounds
from rubber and real bullets fired by rebels at Villa Martelli when
rock- and bottle-throwing demonstrators surged forward.
   Rebels fired from inside the arsenal and from two cars that sped
from the scene, the government news agency Telam reported.
   Three civilians and a policeman were killed in Sunday's clash,
Radio Rivadavia reported.
   The army announced later that Seineldin had given himself up for
arrest and that his followers agreed to put down their weapons and
explosives.
   The rebels had demanded an end to the prosecution of officers for
human rights abuses during the military dictatorships from 1976 to
1983; amnesty for officers already convicted; and better military
pay and equipment.
   One government military officer, Gen. Adolfo Patricio Etcheun,
said he and his men agreed with Seineldin's demands that loyalist
troops not take up arms against the rebels.
   The reason for the surrender was unclear.
   Seineldin gave himself up after meeting with army chief Lt. Gen.
Jose Dante Caridi, and the Noticias Argentinas and Diarios y
Noticias news agencies said Caridi had agreed to a rebel demand that
he resign.
   Alfonsin denied this.
   On Friday, four soldiers and a 19-year-old woman walking near a
rebel stronghold were wounded in exchanges of gunfire between loyal
troops and rebels.
   The rebels' demands spurred similar military uprisings in April
1987 and January 1988.
   Etcheun, commander of the 4th Infantry Paratroop Brigade in
Cordoba, said the demands ``are like mine and most of the army.''
   Most Argentines were happy that what they perceived to be a
threat to their 5-year-old democracy had been overcome.
   ``Democracy Triumphed,'' said a message flashed across the screen
by the five TV stations that had been broadcasting simultaneous news
of the revolt for nearly 24 hours.
   Tens of thousands of people had gathered in plazas throughout the
country to repudiate what they viewed as a threat to the 5-year-old
democracy. The military, which took power in 1976, returned to the
barracks in 1983 after its defeat by Britain in the Falklands War
and an economic collapse.
   Rebels demanded a stop to trials of military officers implicated
in a wave of officially sanctioned terror during military rule. A
government commission said nearly 9,000 Argentines were arrested by
security forces and presumed killed.
   In December 1985, two former military presidents, Jorge Videla
and Roberto Viola, were convicted of human rights abuses.

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas and Soviet
officials today ended their first face-to-face peace talks, and
sources said the guerrillas had softened their objections to an
international peace conference on Afghanistan.
   Sources close to the Afghan delegation, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the guerrillas agreed to study the proposal for a
conference but were demanding that Islamic nations, such as Pakistan
and Saudi Arabia, be allowed to participate.
   Pakistan is one of the main supporters of the guerrillas in their
nine-year war with the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan. The
guerrillas have their headquarters in Pakistan.
   The guerrilla delegation was led by Burhanuddin Rabbani. The
Soviet delegation in the Saudi Arabian mountain resort of Taif was
led by deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov.
   Saudi Arabia supports the Afghan guerrillas and has linked
diplomatic relations with Moscow to an end to the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan.
   Officially, Saudi Arabia maintained a distance from the talks it
organized in the town 600 miles southwest of the capital, Riyadh.
Prince Turki, the chief of intelligence, set up the talks.
   The sources expressed satisfaction at the ``marked progress''
achieved at the three informal sessions.
   The Soviets gave what was described as preliminary agreement to
hand over maps of the minefields laid in areas their troops were
leaving.
   ``The two sides have agreed on a number of points that can form a
good foundation for solving the Afghan problem and bringing peace to
Afghanistan,'' said one source.
   In a statement from Peshawar as the Taif talks started, the
guerrillas demanded immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops, payment
of war reparations, the removal of mines and maps of mined areas now
under Soviet control.
   The sources said there was agreement on side issues such as
prisoners of war, but they gave no details.
   Moscow and Afghan President Najib seek to convene an
international conference to demilitarize the country and set up a
coalition government with the guerrillas. The resistance had
rejected such a conference.
   The guerrillas were not party to an accord signed in Geneva in
April under which the Soviets agreed to withdraw their estimated
100,000 troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15. They have continued
military operations against the Soviets, who suspended the
withdrawal until a cease-fire is reached. Half the Red Army force
remains in Afghanistan.
   The two sides agreed that the Taif meeting and its outcome does
not annul the articles of the Geneva accord, said the sources.
   Rabbani heads a loose alliance of the seven Afghan resistance
groups based in Peshawar, Pakistan. Other resistance leaders joined
Rabbani at the Taif talks.

   The Amsterdam water authority has
stopped taking water from the Rhine because it is polluted by
pesticides from a spill at a West German chemical plant, a
spokeswoman said today.
   The intake point at Nieuwegein, 22 miles south of Amsterdam, was
closed Sunday after unacceptably high levels of the pesticide
Mecoprop were found in the Rhine, according to authority spokeswoman
Anthonia Schierman.
   ``It was accidentally dumped into the river on Nov. 28 by BASF,''
a chemical company in Ludwigshafen, West Germany, Mrs. Schierman
said. About 440 pounds of the toxic agent were spilled, she said.
   The Mecoprop content at the border was 7.2 micrograms a gallon,
nearly 10 times the acceptable level of .76 micrograms a gallon,
Mrs. Schierman said.
   She said the 1 million households in the Dutch capital and the
surrounding area are using water reserves that could last two months.
   Mrs. Schierman said the authority will resume taking in Rhine
water later this week. The water is pumped to reservoirs along the
Dutch coast and then filtered.

   A commuter train whose driver apparently missed a
stop signal slammed into the back of another train in Tokyo today,
killing two people and injuring 97, police and railway authorities
said.
   Shuichiro Yamanouchi, vice president of East Japan Railways,
apologized for the crash at a news conference after the accident.
   Yamanouchi said 28-year-old Teruki Hirano, who was driving the
commuter train, might have missed a signal before plowing into the
back of a train stopped at the Higashi-Nakano Station, said a Japan
Railways official.
   Hirano and Yoji Abo, 31, a resident of Tokyo, were killed in the
9:40 a.m. collision, police said. They said two of the injured were
in critical condition.
   Police said the exact cause of the collision was not known.
   The impact crushed parts of two cars and derailed several cars.
About 10 fire department rescue teams worked to free people from the
cars. News reports said at least 600 people were on the two trains.
   Passengers said there was a huge crash and they were thrown to
the floor.
   ``The train was lifted up quite a bit and seats were broken and
thrown all over in the train,'' said an unidentified man in a
television interview.
   The railway official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
traffic signals on the rail line are controlled automatically to
signal approaching trains to stop.
   He said all East Japan Railways trains are connected to the
system, which also sounds a buzzer to warn drivers that a train is
blocking the line ahead.
   The buzzer, however, can be switched off by the driver and in
metropolitan Tokyo, drivers usually turn off the system for smoother
service during rush hours, the official said.
   It was possible that Hirano either missed the red light or had
his buzzer system off, the official said.
   News reports said westbound trains were running about 10 minutes
behind schedule when the commuter train rammed into the rear of the
other train.
   Keiko Uehara, who runs a bookstore near Higashi-Nakano station,
said the crash made such a noise that ``I thought a building had
fallen down.''
   Tokyo police are investigating the accident and questioning the
driver of the second train as well as the conductors on both trains,
police said.
   The accident was the first involving injuries on Tokyo commuter
trains since March 1986, when about 60 people were hurt in a
two-train collision.
   The last train accident in Japan involving fatalities was in
December 1984, when a train driver was killed and at least 120
people were injured in a head-on collision between two trains.

   Helicopter-borne troops assaulted
communist rebels on two remote islands today, killing at least 15
insurgents and capturing three rebel supply boats loaded with rice,
military officials said.
   Brig. Gen. Alejandro Galido, military commander for southern
Luzon, said the dead included the chief of a village on Kalotkot
island whom he identified as a rebel and operator of the three
30-ton, wooden-hulled boats.
   ``The actual body count is 15 rebels dead,'' Galido said in a
telephone interview from his headquarters in Lucena City, 60 miles
southeast of Manila.
   He said the government suffered no casualties in fighting that
lasted eight hours after six helicopters transported army Scout
Rangers to Kalotkot and nearby Patnanungan island. The islands, in
the Polillo group off Quezon province, are 80 miles east of Manila.
   ``Practically the entire islands are controlled by the NPA,''
Galido said referring to the communist New People's Army.
   He said the rice was shipped to the islands to feed rebels
fleeing increased military operations around Quezon's Mount Banahaw
and the Bondoc Peninsula.
   Col. Hernani Figueroa, southern Luzon command spokesman, said in
a radio interview the troops also captured a truck and a car used by
rebels to transport guerrillas fleeing the Mount Banahaw area.
   Figueroa said some passengers were captured and being
interrogated.

   After spending three days comparing countries
and getting to know each other, Soviet and American delegates at a
superpower conference said they have broken through the
``getting-to-know-you'' stage.
   ``We can speak open now,'' said Vladimir Plise, a cantor at a
Moscow synagogue.
   On Sunday, the 170 Soviet delegates and 169 American delegates to
the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders Summit took advantage of the
chance to play tennis, racquetball, golf, billiards, chess and
volleyball at Cigna Corp.'s corporate center, Eagle Lodge, in
suburban Montgomery County.
   Plise called the facility ``clever, very organized.'' Although
the Soviet Union has similar centers _ he called them ``rest
houses'' _ they are not as big as Eagle Lodge, he said.
   Lilia Vlasova, a Soviet lawyer, said through an interpreter that
she enjoyed seeing American recreation.
   In her hometown of Minsk in the republic of Byelorussia, she said
she is helping plan a youth center and Eagle Lodge has given her
some ideas.
   Bruce Shaeffer, a spokesman for Eagle Lodge, said that although
Cigna has no delegates at the conference, the Philadelphia-based
insurer offered the use of the 280-acre center ``in the spirit of
cooperation.''
   On Saturday, the group got a different look at American sports by
attending the Army-Navy football game, in which Army defeated Navy
20-15.
   On Sunday morning, the delegates had brunch with congressional
representatives and other government officials.
   Delegates to the first-ever gathering of rising stars from the
two nations were chosen to be part of 16 commissions that are
discussing topics such as creative arts, international business,
mass media, the military, religion, education, science and medicine.
   During breaks Sunday, some of the delegates discussed the
progress of the seven-day conference.
   Vlasova said the domestic and international law commission will
discuss education of attorneys and the use of computers in teaching
law.
   Nikolai Devyatkin, a pastor at a church in northern Russia, said
the religion commission is discussing problems that churches face in
the two countries.
   He said he visited a black church in Philadelphia on Sunday and
was impressed by the emotion displayed.
   ``I have never seen that before today,'' he said.
   Plise, the cantor, said he too feels there are differences
between churches in the countries, but has not exactly figured them
out.
   ``We need time to understand this process,'' he said.
   While the Soviet delegates were far from their homeland, the
ethnic strife and nationalism boiling in some of the Soviet
republics was on the minds of some of them.
   Rein Kaarepere, assistant to the prime minister of Estonia, was
wearing the traditional blue, black and white colors of the Estonian
flag and speaks Estonian. He is among those who hope the once
sovereign country can establish an economy not beholden to Moscow.
   Only for the past year have Estonians been able to wear the
colors of their state, which was free between the first and second
world wars. The republic's leaders have led the charge in a recent
quest by Soviet minorities for greater autonomy.
   The Soviet Union, under Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, or
restructuring, is aiming for drastic change in its economic
structure. ``But it's another thing when this is warped to an
absurdity,'' said Viktor Mironenko, a member of the Supreme Soviet's
Presidium, the country's highest executive body, and also a delegate
to the conference.
   Elsewhere in the Soviet Union, nationalism has turned violent. At
least 60 people have died since February in ethnic rioting between
Armenians and Azebaijanis in the Soviet Caucasus region, near the
Middle East.
   Delegates from those republics canceled their trips to the
conference as violence flared again in recent weeks.

   The Federation of Arab News Agencies
appealed today for the release of Terry A. Anderson, the Associated
Press correspondent held hostage in Lebanon.
   The appeal was issued by the federation's secretary general,
Farid Ayyar, after he returned from the 17th annual meeting of the
federation's general assembly in Damascus, the Syrian capital. The
federation consists of 17 Arab news agencies.
   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped in west Beirut March 16, 1985. Islamic Jihad, a
Shiite Moslem group loyal to Iran, has claimed it holds Anderson,
who has been a captive longer than any other foreign hostage in
Lebanon.
   ``The general assembly discussed the question of Terry Anderson's
continued abduction and resolved that this is hampering the
publication of Arab news abroad and curbing the freedom of the press
in general,'' Ayyar said in a statement.
   ``We appeal to Terry Anderson's holders to reconsider their
position because the AP bureau chief was conducting a professional
mission without any involvement in the existing conflicts,'' Ayyar
said.
   He urged ``all influential forces in Lebanon to act for
Anderson's speedy release'' and called on all journalists'
organizations worldwide to help bring this about.
   In addition to Anderson, at least 14 foreigners are believed held
hostage in Lebanon.

   Surrealist artist Salvador Dali left the
intensive care unit today, a week after being rushed to Quiron
Clinic because of heart trouble and blood clots in his lungs.
   A statement from his five doctors said the 84-year-old painter's
condition ``continues to improve favorably'' and that he was no
longer receiving medication intravenously.
   Dr. Juan Garcia San Miguel told reporters complications still
could arise, but ``the possibility he could suffer a setback is
greatly reduced.''
   Dali was taken to the clinic Nov. 28 from a hospital in his
hometown of Figueras, 60 miles north of Barcelona. He had entered
Figueras hospital the previous day suffering from pneumonia.
   The artist has been in poor health since August 1984, when a fire
broke out in the bedroom of his Pubol Castle residence in La Pera,
40 miles south of Figueras.
   After leaving the hospital three months later, Dali moved to his
Galatea Tower mansion attached to his Theater-Museum in Figueras.
   In July 1986 he underwent surgery in Barcelona to receive a
pacemaker.
   Dali, a founder of the Surrealist movement, is the last living
member of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that
included Pablo Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who died a
decade later.

   President Chaim Herzog today granted Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc a three-week extension to form
a government and urged it to try again to bring the rival Labor
Party into a coalition.
   Shamir so far has failed to attract Labor into a broad-based
coalition led by his right-wing party. He appears close to forming a
narrow coalition with small religious and far-right parties.
   Shamir requested the extension after a three-week mandate Herzog
gave him Nov. 14 expired. Israeli law allows for a three-week
extension.
   ``By virtue of the power invested in me by law I have acceded to
his request and agreed to grant him an extension of 21 days'' to
form a government, Herzog said after meeting Shamir at his residence.
   ``The country needs a broad government. We need a stable
government to deal with the challenges and dangers we face,'' Herzog
added. His remarks were broadcast live by Israel radio.
   Likud and Labor have been uneasy governing partners since 1984.
   The president also urged the new government to reform Israel's
electoral system, which resulted in a stalemate in Nov. 1 elections.
   ``There is nothing like this system in the entire democratic
world,'' Herzog said, alluding to the complicated task facing Shamir
as he tries to bring together at least eight of 15 parties in the
120-member parliament to form a majority.
   Coalition bargaining since the elections has been characterized
by acrimony within both the Likud and the left-leaning Labor Party.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a top Labor official, lashed out
at party leader Shimon Peres today, accusing him of conducting
secret negotiations with religious parties.
   Rabin denounced Peres confidant Yossi Beilin as ``the poodle of
Peres'' for carrying out the talks without the knowledge of other
party leaders.
   Beilin, a member of Labor's rebellious young guard, noted that he
and Rabin had long-standing ideological differences. He told Israel
army radio that ``Rabin in his old age is an embarrassment to the
younger Rabin. I would prefer to remember him the way he was when he
was young.''
   On Sunday, Likud gained the upper hand in attempts to form a
coalition government by signing an agreement with the ultra-Orthodox
Torah Flag party, which holds two seats in the parliament. Shamir
now has the backing of 60 legislators in the 120-member body.
   Last week, the Agudat Israel religious party suprisingly defected
from Likud to Labor, apparently after being contacted by Beilin.
Beilin made the move a day before the Labor's executive bureau was
to decide whether to approve Labor-Likud negotiations on forming a
broad-based government.
   The bureau eventually rejected the talks.
   Peres told army radio Subday he accepted Likud's conditions for
Labor joining a coalition, but that Shamir would have to make the
first move.
   However, Peres added: ``At this stage, I think we are closer to
the opposition than to any other place.''
   Shamir favors a broad-based government because it would reduce
the pressure on Likud to meet demands by its likely coalition
partners, four religious and three extreme right-wing parties.
   Public opinion polls held after the Nov. 1 balloting, in which
Likud won 40 Knesset seats to Labor's 39, showed that the majority
of Israelis supported a broad-based government.
   Secular Israelis and U.S. Jews are worried that Orthodox parties
may succeed in passing far-reaching religious legislation in
exchange for their participation in a narrow government.
   The Likud made such promises to Agudat Israel to lure it back
from Labor. A letter signed by Shamir and several Likud ministers
was presented Sunday night to the Council of Torah Sages, the
spiritual advisory body of Agudat Israel.
   The letter said Likud would support legislation that gives
Orthodox rabbis sole authority over conversions to Judaism.
   The law is opposed by U.S. Jews because it would deny automatic
immigration to Israel by Jews not converted by Orthodox rabbis. The
majority of U.S. Jews are Reform and Conservative, and they see the
proposed change as a threat to their legitimacy.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Bar Roadside Sobriety Tests in California Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to bar police
from conducting roadside sobriety tests by setting up checkpoints at
unannounced locations.
   The court, by a 7-2 vote, let stand a ruling from California that
such tests for drunken driving do not violate the rights of
motorists.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Byron R. White voted to hear
arguments in the case. But it takes the votes of at least four
justices to grant such review.
   Police in Anaheim, Calif., arrested a juvenile identified as
Richard T. in the early morning hours of New Year's Day 1985. He was
charged with driving under the influence of alcohol.
   Richard T. was stopped at a police roadblock set up as part of a
holiday season crackdown on drunken driving.
   Police announced in advance that the checkpoints would be set up
around the city, but did not advertise their locations.
   Police said they smelled alcohol on Richard T.'s breath when they
stopped him, and they said he told them he was coming from a party.
He then was taken to a second checkpoint where he failed a sobriety
test and was arrested.
   A state appeals court ordered the test evidence suppressed. The
appeals court said police may conduct such tests only if there is an
emergency, if there is reason to believe in advance that a motorist
is intoxicated or if the tests are carried out at fixed locations
where motorists know they may be tested.
   The California Supreme Court last March overturned the appeals
court decision and ruled that the police acted lawfully.
   Lawyers for Richard T. said the checkpoints in Anaheim were
similar to roving police patrols that stop motorists for sobriety
tests without reasonable suspicion of drunken driving. The U.S.
Supreme Court barred such stops by roving patrols in a 1979 ruling.
   California officials said the police conduct in Anaheim did not
violate motorists' privacy rights.
   ``Given the serious safety and social problems presented by drunk
drivers and the minimal intrusion to privacy caused by momentary
detention at a sobriety checkpoint ... use of these checkpoints is
reasonable,'' the California attorney general's office said.
   The case is Richard T. vs. California, 88-318.

<HEAD>Justices Won't Revive Award to Tennessee Woman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
$70,000 award to a Tennessee woman who said her rights had been
violated in a dispute with public school officials over ``godless''
textbooks.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Vicki Frost, a
Christian fundamentalist briefly arrested for refusing to leave
school grounds during an attempt to remove her daughter from a
reading class.
   Mrs. Frost, of Rogersville, was among seven Tennessee familes who
objected to textbooks approved by the Hawkins County Board of
Education.
   The Supreme Court last February denied an earlier appeal by the
families, essentially ending a case some had called Scopes II, a
reference to the furor surrounding the 1925 prosecution of John
Scopes in Tennessee for teaching evolution.
   The justices let stand a ruling that requiring children to read
books their parents objected to does not violate the families'
constitutional rights.
   The case acted on today involved a separate civil rights suit by
Mrs. Frost stemming from the dispute.
   Mrs. Frost, a mother of three, was allowed for a time in 1983 to
remove her daughter Sarah from a reading class at Church Hill
Elementary School.
   School officials permitted Mrs. Frost to take Sarah to the
school's library or cafeteria for a reading lesson from books Mrs.
Frost approved.
   She objected to the school's textbooks, which she said taught
secular humanism, evolution and other beliefs she considered
``godless.''
   School officials changed their policy in November 1983 and no
longer permitted Mrs. Frost to remove Sarah from the classroom for
individual instruction.
   Mrs. Frost objected to the new policy and was jailed for about
three hours on Nov. 23, 1983, when she refused to leave the school
premises after being ordered to by the school principal.
   A jury awarded her $70,000 in a federal lawsuit charging school
officials with false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, violation
of her free-speech rights and deprivation of the custody of her
child.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award last
July.
   The appeals court said her claims ``are without merit.'' The
appeals court said Mrs. Frost was aware she no longer would be able
to remove Sarah from class and had an ``unencumbered freedom'' to
put Sarah in a private school _ a move she made in December 1983.
   But rather than transfer Sarah immediately, ``Frost chose to send
her daughter back to Church Hill Elementary and renew her disruption
of the school's normal routine,'' the appeals court said.
   ``The evidence points so strongly in favor (of school officials)
that we think reasonable minds could not come to a different
conclusion,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Frost vs. Hawkins County Board, 88-604.

   The Supreme Court today barred a New Hampshire
community from removing poles bearing sirens that could alert
townspeople about an accident at the controversial Seabrook nuclear
power plant.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that limits the
power of cities to revoke licenses for the poles.
   Public Service of New Hampshire, major owner of Seabrook, is
required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop an
emergency evacuation plan in case of an accident at the plant.
   The utility company installed sirens placed on poles in several
seacoast communities, including Rye, N.H.
   The poles are about 60 feet high, with sirens weighing about 500
pounds attached to them.
   The Rye Board of Selectmen in 1984 licensed three poles in the
town. The New Hampshire Department of Transportation also authorized
poles on state highways, including state roads that pass through Rye.
   The board of selectmen then changed its mind and sought to revoke
the licenses. A state judge ordered the poles removed. But the New
Hampshire Supreme Court overruled the judge last March.
   Towns may not veto nuclear evacuation plans without good reason,
such as public safety, the state Supreme Court said.
   The state court said Rye selectmen ``lack the authority to revoke
the licenses they granted ... for any reason other than a reason
relating to the safe, free and convenient use for public travel of
the highway.'' The state court said the selectmen offered no
justification based on safety for removing the poles.
   The $5.6 billion Seabrook plant has been a target of protests
since before construction began in 1976.
   It was completed in 1986, but has been unable to get a federal
operating license. Federal regulators have yet to approve evacuation
plans for communities surrounding Seabrook, including some in
Massachusetts.
   There are also serious financial problems, with Public Service of
New Hampshire having filed for bankruptcy protection in January.
   The case is Rye vs. Public Service of New Hampshire, 88-621.

<HEAD>Court to Resolve Decisions in Tax Dispute Over Louisiana Insurance
Firm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to resolve
conflicting decisions by federal appeals courts in a tax dispute
between the Internal Revenue Service and the life insurance industry.
   The court said it will decide whether the ``ceding commissions''
a life insurance company pays when reinsuring another firm's
policies may be claimed as tax deductions for the year they are paid.
   The IRS refused to let Colonial American Life Insurance Co., a
Lousiana-based corporation, claim some $1.5 million in such
deductions for 1975 and 1976.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the tax agency's
refusal last April but other appeals courts have allowed such
deductions.
   Colonial American's appeal to the nation's highest court was
supported by the American Council of Life Insurance and the National
Association of Life Companies.
   The Reagan administration, arguing that the 5th Circuit court
ruled correctly, nevertheless urged the justices to take the
Colonial American case to resolve the conflicting lower court
rulings.
   Colonial American in 1975 and 1976 agreed to partially indemnify
Transport Life Insurance Co. policies. In return, Colonial American
became entitled to the same percentage of future premiums received
on the policies.
   The agreements provided that Transport was to pay, as reinsurance
premiums, amounts equal to the reserves required to cover Colonial
American's liability on the policies.
   The reinsurance premiums were $675,762 for 1975 and $851,398 for
1976.
   The agreements also required Colonial American to pay Transport
Life ceding commissions in consideration for the business acquired.
The commissions totaled $680,000 in 1975 and $852,000 in 1976.
   Colonial American then sought to deduct as business losses the
full amount of the commissions in the years they were paid.
   The IRS disallowed the deductions, ruling that those amounts
represented the acquisition costs of future benefits. The tax agency
said that the ceding commissions should be capitalized and amortized
over the period of the policies' indemnification _ seven years.
   The U.S. Tax Court ruled for Colonial American but the 5th
Circuit court reversed that ruling.
   The case is Colonial American vs. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 88-396.

<HEAD>Report: Yellowstone Fire Could Have Been Stopped Early</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire near Yellowstone National Park
that threatened Cooke City, Mont., last summer could have been
snuffed out in its earliest stages, government officials say in new
reports.
   But another blaze, which almost burned the historic Old Faithful
complex at the park and threatened West Yellowstone, Mont., was
impossible to control, the reports said.
   In all, the 10 major fires that cut a swath of flames through
Yellowstone burned about 706,000 acres. The latest report Friday
indicated the fires covered much less than the 1 million-acre
estimate given in September.
   The new figures, based on satellite pictures assessed last week,
indicate that about 32 percent of the 2.2 million-acre park burned.
   By underestimating drought conditions, Yellowstone firefighters
missed an early opportunity to stop the Clover-Mist fire in the
northeast corner of the park, which threatened Cooke City, an
interagency review team said. Instead of their own observations,
park and national forest officials relied on fire information
gathered since the early 1970s, the report said.
   The Clover and Mist fires eventually merged and burned 309,600
acres in the park and national forests.
   Another team that looked at the North Fork fire on the park's
western edge, which threatened the Old Faithful area, concluded that
no amount of resources would have stopped it.
   The reports were prepared by National Park Service and U.S.
Forest Service fire specialists who interviewed managers and fire
bosses.
   The Clover and Mist fires started July 9 and July 11.
   ``At this time, the park could have suppressed both fires with
initial action forces,'' the report said. ``Projected spread and
worst-case analysis underestimated the potential of these fires to
cross the Continental Divide onto the Shoshone National Forest.''
   Dan Sholly, Yellowstone's chief ranger, said historic weather
trends showing rains in July and August led park officials to
underestimate fire conditions. But he noted that even the country's
best fire experts underestimated fire conditions later in the summer.
   ``We're mortals,'' he said.
   Dick Hodge, forest ranger on the Clearwater National Forest in
Potlatch and a member of the review team, said that the first five
days, July 9-14, were the only chance park officials had to stop the
blazes.
   ``After that it had grown big enough that we doubted they could
have controlled it completely,'' Hodge said in a phone interview.
   The North Fork fire started July 22 when a wood cutter dropped a
cigarette in the Targhee National Forest. It quickly spread and
bulldozers were not allowed inside the park during the initial
attack.
   But with spot fires detected up to a half mile ahead of the fire
the next day, Troy Kurth, the Yellowstone Area fire commander,
judged that bulldozer lines would not hold the fire.
   ``There could have been a loss of equipment, crews in danger and
unnecessary damage to the environment,'' the report said. ``The end
result, an escaped fire, would have been the same.''
   The review team went even further in supporting the firefighting
effort by park and fire bosses.
   ``Using more resources, in most instances, would not have led to
greater control of the main fire,'' they said in the report.
   The North Fork and Wolf Lake fires eventually covered more than
500,000 acres in Yellowstone and Targhee National Forest.
   The review teams submitted their reports Friday to the Greater
Yellowstone Coordinating Committee in Denver. The committee will
present reports to the larger interagency group that is preparing a
final report on the fires for Congress and the secretaries of the
interior and agriculture. It is due for release Dec. 15.

<TEXT>
   Investigators are trying to determine
whether Israeli counterterrorism expert Amiram Nir was really
interested in avocados during a visit to this backwater town that
ended with his death in a plane crash.
   Nir, who died Wednesday, was not known as an avocado exporter. He
had advised two Israeli prime ministers on terrorism and was linked
to the Iran-Contra deal that embarrassed the Reagan administration.
   Avocado grower Carlos Garcia Mendez and a police official said
Nir stayed in the best hotel, discussed avocado prices and inspected
an avocado processing plant during a three-day visit to this town
nearly 200 miles west of Mexico City.
   ``It was his destiny to die here,'' was the only explanation
Mendez could offer Sunday in an interview.
   Staffers at the Hotel Real de Uruapan said Nir was traveling with
a man who registered as a Lebanese and left before Nir did.
   The wife of the owner of Aerotaxis of Uruapan, Marta Amezcua,
said Nir and Adriana Stanton, a Canadian woman who was working for
an avocado operation, chartered a small plane on Wednesday.
   The Aerotaxis plane crashed near Ciudad Hidalgo, killing Nir and
an airline employee and injuring Ms. Stanton and the pilot,
Amezcua's son.
   A security guard stands outside the room where Ms. Stanton is
hospitalized in Mexico City. Ms. Stanton, who suffered leg, arm and
facial fractures, has refused to speak to reporters since Thursday,
when she said she barely knew Nir.
   No one can explain why Nir, who registered under his own name at
the hotel, apparently gave an assumed name when he chartered the
aircraft.
   Israeli officials and friends' of Nir's in Israel said he was in
Mexico on business, but they refused to say what the business
involved.
   Garcia Mendez is a partner in Eupasa, a six-month old business
that is trying to export avocados to Europe through Nucal, a Swiss
firm. He said his operation grows about 500 tons of avocados a year.
   Mexico has been looking for expanded export markets for
agricultural products such as avocados.
   Garcia Mendez said Nir dealt mostly with Pedro Curchet, an
official of Eupasa in charge of quality control. He said Ms. Stanton
was in charge of shipping arrangements for Eupasa.
   Curchet was the man who went to Ciudad Hidalgo and identified
Nir's body, according to federal judicial police commander Jose Luis
Arriaga. Curchet said Nir had planned to return to Uruapan in a
week, possibly to close a deal with Eupasa, according to Arriaga.
   Arriaga said he had no evidence Nir's visit involved anything but
avocados.
   Hotel personnel said Curchet and Stanton had been in Uruapan
since September, which is when the avocado harvest begins.
   Eupasa employs about 50 people in its packing operation, and
other avocado growers in the area recently formed a competing
organization, the Association of Producers and Exporters.
   On Sunday, The Washington Post quoted Nir as saying in an
interview earlier this year that counterterrorist operations he
supervised in 1985 and 1986 with former White House aide Oliver
North were authorized by a secret agreement between the United
States and Israel.
   Israel denied the report. Secretary of State George Shultz, asked
if such an agreement ever existed, said: ``Not that I know of.''

<HEAD>Justices Ask for Comment in Arizona Reservation-Crime Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Justice
Department for its views on whether states may prosecute non-Indians
accused of crimes against Indians on tribal reservations.
   The court invited government lawyers to comment on an appeal by
Arizona officials seeking to prosecute a non-Indian school teacher
accused of sexual relations with Indian boys on a Navajo reservation.
   The justices are not expected to say whether they will grant full
review to the case until hearing from the government. That could
take months.
   A lower court ruled that the federal government has exclusive
authority to prosecute the man.
   The teacher, Conrad Marion Flint, was indicted twice by state
grand juries on charges of oral sexual contact with minors and
commercial sexual exploitation of minors.
   Flint, who is not an Indian, taught fifth grade students at the
Kayenta School District on the Navajo reservation.
   He allegedly lured Indian boys to his apartment, leased from the
Navajos, paid them to pose nude and engaged in sexual acts with them.
   The state said it seized more than 2,000 photographs and
videotapes from Flint's apartment.
   A state judge threw out the indictments on grounds only the
federal government may prosecute non-Indians for crimes against
Indians that take place on tribal reservations.
   The Arizona Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling last
January.
   The appeals court, citing a 1946 Supreme Court ruling, said Flint
``is charged with serious sexual crimes against several young Indian
males, thus creating a strong tribal interest.'' In such cases,
state officials lack authority to act, the state court said.
   The case is Arizona vs. Flint, 88-603.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
lawsuit seeking money for six injured FBI agents and for the
families of two agents killed in a Miami gun battle with two men who
also died.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the agents
and their families should be allowed to use a federal
anti-racketeering law to recover damages from the estates of the two
alleged criminals.
   The shootout occurred on April 11, 1986, as the result of an FBI
investigation into a series of robberies, extortions and attempted
murders in the Miami area.
   After a car chase, the agents caught up with Michael Lee Platt
and William Russell Matix after the two men allegedly robbed the
Barnett Bank in Miami.
   In the ensuing gun battle, agents Benjamin Grogan and Jerry Dove
were killed along with Platt and Matix. The injured agents were John
Hanlon, Gordon McNeill, Edmundo Mireles, Richard Manauzzi, Gilbert
Orrantia and Ronald Risner.
   The agents and their families sought compensation under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
   The federal law is used for criminal prosecutions and also
authorizes civil lawsuits for recovery of triple damages for ``any
person injured in his business or property'' by racketeering
activities.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last January upheld a
federal judge's ruling throwing out the suit.
   ``In our view, the ordinary meaning of the phrase `injured in his
business or property' excludes personal injuries, including the
pecuniary losses therefrom,'' the appeals court said. ``We do not
understand Congress to have authorized recovery for these injuries.''
   The 11th Circuit court noted that the Supreme Court in 1985
permitted wide latitude for civil suits invoking RICO and that the
law was being used in increasingly imaginative ways.
   But, the appeals court said, ``some limits on civil RICO still
exist.''
   The case is Grogan vs. Platt, 88-650.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said
today he would not go to the United Nations this week because the
United States failed to issue enough visas for his party and imposed
unacceptable restrictions on his stay.
   ``I cannot accept these rules because the United States cannot
decide when, how and with whom a chief of state can visit an
international organization like the United Nations,'' Ortega told a
news conference.
   He complained that the United States should not require 15 days
notice to approve the trip of a chief of state and his party to the
United Nations.
   Ortega said the Reagan administration refused to issue visas for
half his party and also refused to issue visas for Nicaraguan
journalists who wished to accompany him.
   He also said the United States limited his travels to four
boroughs of New York City. Ortega said this would prevent him from
visiting the home of the Nicaraguan ambassador to the United
Nations, who lives outside that area.
   ``The United States has violated international norms and its
promises to the United Nations and has broken the principles of the
United Nations,'' Ortega said.
   He said that at the United Nations he had hoped to describe the
extensive damage done in Nicaragua by Hurricane Joan and plead for
international help.
   Ortega said he also wanted to confer with U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar about a new proposal for the United Nations
to participate in verifiying a Central American peace accord.
   Ortega was in Mexico for the inauguration of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari. He said he was returning today to Managua, the
Nicaraguan capital.
   On Friday, U.S. officials said visas had been approved for
Ortega, his wife, Rosario, and his son Rafael, on Dec. 5. They were
to be accompanied by Ortega's physician and 14 guards.
   Visa applications from 14 other Nicaraguans who wished to
accompany Ortega as part of his official party were turned down
because they were submitted too late to allow adequate time for
processing, U.S. officials said.
   U.S. officials said Ortega had planned to meet with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who will address the U.N. General
Assembly this week and will meet with President Reagan and
President-elect George Bush.

<HEAD>School's Decision to Ban Holiday Play Upsets Parents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents and children say a school
district's ban on a non-biblical play based on the birth of Jesus
violates their First Amendemnt rights, but administrators say they
are upholding the Constitution.
   A fifth-grade class in central Michigan selected ``No Room at the
Inn'' from a book of plays in the school library. The play tells the
story of a coldhearted innkeeper who refuses a room to a pregnant
woman, then is transformed after the baby is born.
   Superintendent John Reynolds of the Waverly School District said
the play ``could be viewed as promotion of Christianity.''
   ``School officials are just trying to be sensitive to their
duties to abide by the law,'' schools attorney Scott Szpara said.
``The content appears to violate the (First) Amendment's
establishment clause, which forbids public schools from favoring or
encouraging any religion.''
   But parents say they are not buying the argument. They met
Saturday to press their demand for a special Board of Education
meeting Tuesday on the ban.
   ``The ban violates the children's constitutional right to free
speech and another First Amendment clause that prevents the state
from inhibiting the free exercise of religion,'' said David Kallman,
an attorney representing the parents.
   Several students expressed the same view.
   ``It's just not fair,'' said Peggy Huizen, 10, a fifth-grader.
``I can understand they don't like religious plays performed, but we
found this in our own school library in a book of traditional
holiday plays, `100 Plays for Children.' It's not a religious play.''
   Kallman said the play doesn't promote a specific religion because
it is a fictional account.
   ``Jesus' name isn't even in it,'' Kallman said.

   A simple dome-like structure used by Plains
Indians for ancient worship rites is the focus of a long-running
battle over religion and rehabilitation between tribal leaders and
Utah State Prison officials.
   Six Indian inmates are suing for the right to build sweat lodges
at the state's only maximum security prison, 25 miles south of Salt
Lake City.
   ``It's a form of worship and I think prison officials really
ought to be more cognizant of it as a rehabilitative tool,'' said
Travis Parashonts, a Paiute Indian who is director of the Utah
Office of Indian Affairs. ``It's a very uplifting and spiritual
experience.''
   But prison officials say the lodges represent a security risk,
and call the Indians' demand unreasonable.
   Permitting a sweat lodge would be akin to allowing ``a mosque and
minaret for the Moslems, a shrine for the Buddhists, a temple for
the Latter-day Saints, and a cathedral for the Catholics,'' said
Corrections Executive Director Gary DeLand, a defendant in the
20-month-old federal lawsuit that is scheduled for trial next month.
   The sweat lodge is a small structure made of willow poles covered
with blankets or dirt. They are often circular resembling tepees but
can be square, hutlike structures.
   Inside, usually about eight to 10 people sing and pray around a
pit of heated stones in a quest for purification, forgiveness and
spiritual renewal. Some Indians pray to a Great Spirit, who is the
father of all things and a life force; others pray to spirits
associated with various aspects of nature like rocks or animals.
   Tribal leaders have been frustrated by the prison ban on lodges,
particularly because nine other western states allow them in their
prisons. The other states include Arizona and Nevada, which like
Utah is where the 25,000-square-mile Navajo Reservation is located.
   The 180,000-member Navajo tribe has repeatedly offered to
construct a sweat lodge at its own cost _ estimated at only about
$50 _ and provide medicine men to conduct ceremonies.
   ``It wouldn't cost the state anything,'' said Larry Foster, the
tribe's director of intergovernmental relations. ``Given the fact
that we've been able to work with all the other states, I guess in a
sense it's perplexing.''
   Tribal officials say comparisons with structures for other
religions are unfair because sweat lodges can be built so quickly
and cheaply. They also dismiss fears of security risks.
   ``There is nothing there (at a sweat lodge ceremony) that could
be used in a negative manner,'' said Clifford Duncan, director of
the Ute Indian Museum at Fort Duchesne. There are about 2,200 Utes
living on the 2 million-acre Uintah and Ouray Reservation in eastern
Utah.
   The lawsuit was filed in March 1987 and is scheduled for trial
Jan. 9 in U.S. District Court.
   Plaintiffs' attorney Danny Quintana said he hoped newly elected
Attorney General Paul Van Dam, a Democrat, would be more flexible
than his predecessor, Republican David Wilkinson, and seek to settle
the issue out of court.
   ``He seems to have a little more common sense than his
predecessor but I don't know. I hope so,'' Quintana said.
   Van Dam said he plans to review the case but he would not discuss
the likelihood of a settlement. ``It's simply a matter that will
take me a few weeks to get to ... (but) that is an important case,''
he said.
   Foster said the Navajo will watch Van Dam's arrival with interest
but will ``continue, irregardless, to assist those inmates in the
practice of their religion.''

   Homeless activists angered by Mikhail
Gorbachev's plans to visit New York City's opulent Trump Tower are
inviting the Soviet leader to a homeless shelter and a soup kitchen
to get ``a more balanced and realistic view of our nation.''
   The invitation was made in a letter prepared for delivery to the
Soviet Embassy today, a day before the Soviet president arrives in
New York to address the United Nations General Assembly.
   Gorbachev's itinerary includes a meeting Wednesday with
billionaire developer Donald Trump at the 68-story Manhattan
building that carries Trump's name, Trump's office, Trump's $19
million apartment, six levels of shopping and millions of dollars
worth of embellishments.
   The New York Public Interest Research Group, a Ralph Nader
organization, has already said it wants to stage a protest outside
the building.
   ``Donald Trump represents one extreme in this country and there's
a whole other side to the United States we believe Mr. Gorbachev
should see,'' Mitch Snyder, spokesman for the Washington-based
Community for Creative Non-Violence, said Sunday.
   In the invitation from CCNV, Snyder wrote that Trump and his
glitzy constructions ``are not reflective of the vast majority of
our countrymen and women. In stark contrast ... stand millions of
homeless United States citizens.''
   ``If you are to have a more balanced and realistic view of our
nation, I urge you to also visit Grand Central Station, where
hundreds of homeless people line up for soup and sandwiches each
evening ... or visit the Fort Washington shelter where ... 1,000
homeless people are crowded into a large room,'' Snyder wrote.
   ``The homeless would be happy to meet with you,'' the invitation
read. ``A visit by you would convey that they, too, have value and
worth.''
   Gorbachev's schedule includes time on Thursday for seeing other
parts of New York. Mayor Edward Koch said Sunday he wished he could
show Gorbachev the city ``in every respect, warts and all.''
   CCNV invited Gorbachev during his summit meeting with Reagan last
year to visit the 600-bed shelter the group runs in downtown
Washington. The Kremlin leader did not go to the shelter, but Soviet
Embassy officials donated $5,000 and several ``gifts from the Soviet
people'' to the group at a ceremony two weeks after the summit.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis today urged leaders of the
nation's cities to keep the municipal issues that were raised during
the 1988 presidential campaign before the incoming Bush
administration.
   Homelessness and potential cuts in Medicare and Medicaid funding
were among the issues Dukakis cited in a speech to 5,000 delegates
to the 65th Congress of the National League of Cities, which
formally opened today.
   ``The issues we raised in the campaign haven't dissappeared
because the election is over,'' the former Democratic presidential
candidate said. ``We can not retreat. We can not go backwards.''
   Dukakis blamed a lack of affordable housing on cuts in federal
housing subsidies during the Reagan administration, but indicated he
and President-elect George Bush found some common ground on the
issue during their meeting last Friday.
   ``He called it a national disgrace, and it is,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis said forging partnerships among state and local
governments, the banking industry and building trade unions is
necessary to ease the housing crunch.
   More than 8,000 delegates from 1,300 local governments were
expected to attend the convention. The leagus is the nation's
largest municipal organization.
   Earlier, league officials said they will urge the Bush
administration to strengthen ties between local and federal
government.
   ``In the past there has not been a positive relationship between
the state and federal levels,'' the league's vice president, Mayor
Terry Goddard of Phoenix, said Saturday.
   Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn called the convention ``an
excellent opportunity to set an urban agenda for the nation's
cities.''
   League President Pamela P. Plumb, a Portland, Maine, city council
member and former mayor, said the nation's cities and towns ``will
bear the brunt of deficit reduction programs unless President-elect
Bush deals with revenue collection in a serious way.''
   She said critical issues cited by delegates for discussion at the
convention include affordable housing, economic development, job
training, fighting inner-city drug use and improving education.
   Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich said that during the past two
years, the federal government has cut state programs by 60 percent.
   ``A message needs to be sent to Washington saying no more
mandates, regulations or intrusion in state and local fiscal
affairs,'' he said.

<HEAD>Stage Set for Ruling on Punitive-Damage Awards in Texas-Vermont
Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 00-00, In other action, with other cases</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set the stage for an
important ruling on the constitutionality of enormous
punitive-damage awards that have become increasingly common in a
range of lawsuits.
   The justices agreed to study the issue in an appeal by
Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., a waste collection business with
headquarters in Houston. The company was ordered to pay $6 million
to a Burlington, Vt., competitor that accused the Texas company of
undercutting its prices in an effort to drive it out of business.
   The high court last May declined to decide the constitutionality
of such enormous punitive-damage awards in personal-injury and
breach-of-contract cases.
   In its May ruling, the court cited narrow, procedural reasons for
upholding a $1.8 million judgment won by an injured Mississippi man
against an insurance company that wrongfully rejected his $20,000
claim.
   Left unresolved was the legitimacy of skyrocketing
punitive-damage awards, a development that has touched off a wave of
legislative activity, often called ``tort reform.''
   Some states, reacting to soaring insurance rates, have imposed
ceilings on how much punitive-damage money can be recovered.
   The court's decision last May, and its dismissal shortly
thereafter of several cases that mounted similar challenges to
punitive damages, indicated the justices were willing to give state
legislatures and state courts more time to study the issue.
   But the justices announced today they now will tackle the issue,
with a decision expected by July.
   The court will review a decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last April that upheld the damage award against
Browning-Ferris.
   The company, with revenues in excess of $1.3 billion in 1986,
decided in 1973 to enter the waste disposal business in Burlington,
Vt.
   The company appointed Joseph Kelley to be district manager for
its new regional office.
   Kelley left Browning-Ferris in 1980 to form his own company,
Kelco Disposal Inc., which soon became a direct competitor.
   Kelco captured more than 40 percent of the market in the
Burlington region by 1982.
   There was testimony in the case that Browning-Ferris then
instructed its new Burlington manager to ``put Kelly out of
business. Do whatever it takes. Squish him like a bug.''
   Browning-Ferris then cut its prices almost in half. The
price-cutting maneuver prompted a suit by Kelly accusing
Browning-Ferris of attempting to monopolize the waste collection
market in the region in violation of antitrust laws.
   A jury awarded Kelco about $100,000 in compensatory damages and
on the antitrust claim and $6 million in punitive damages.
   The 2nd Circuit court said, ``We do not think the damages here
were so disproportionate as to be cruel, unusual or constitutionally
excessive.''
   In other action the court:
   _ Agreed to hear a Reagan administration appeal aimed at limiting
recovery of lawyers' fees for people who win disputes with the
government over Social Security benefits.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the government
reimburse attorneys' fees for an Alabama woman who won disability
benefits.
   _ Refused to revive a $70,000 award to a Tennessee woman who said
her rights were violated in a dispute with public school officials
over ``godless'' textbooks.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Vicki Frost, a
Christian fundamentalist briefly arrested for refusing to leave
school grounds during an attempt to remove her daughter from a
reading class.
   _ Agreed to decide whether a federal law allowing public scrutiny
of governmental advisory groups applies to the American Bar
Association's role in picking federal judges.
   The court said it will review a ruling that shields the ABA's
judicial selection committee from the law.
   _ Refused to bar police from conducting roadside sobriety tests
by setting up checkpoints at unannounced locations.
   The court, by a 7-2 vote, let stand a ruling from California that
such tests for drunken driving do not violate the rights of
motorists.
   _ Refused to revive a lawsuit seeking money for six injured FBI
agents and for the families of two agents killed in a Miami gun
battle with two men who also died.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the agents
and their families should be allowed to use a federal
anti-racketerring law to recover damages from the estates of the two
alleged criminals.
   The punitive damages case is Browning-Ferris vs. Kelco Disposal,
88-556.

<HEAD>Meeting Broken Up in Azerbaijan, Curfew Reduced in Armenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces broke up a meeting in the
Azerbaijani capital, but in neighboring Armenia authorities eased a
curfew today, media reports said.
   Much of the two republics in the southern Caucasus Mountains have
been under curfew to stem violence generated by an ethnic dispute.
Armenians, who are mostly Christian, seek control of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a district in Moslem Azerbaijan.
   Radio Moscow said today of the Azerbaijani capital that ``the
situation in Baku still remains tense. At a number of enterprises
people have failed to come out to work. No transport is operating in
the center of the city.''
   The report, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London, said security forces dispersed a crowd of around 1,500
people in Baku's Lenin Square Sunday night. The forces moved in
after the crowd failed to respond to appeals by the chairman of the
city council and a commandant to disperse.
   Demonstrations and meetings are banned under military law imposed
two weeks ago.
   ``Irresponsible elements among those who gathered tried to put up
resistance,'' the broadcast said. ``The servicemen fulfilled the
tasks that had been put to them. No weapons were used.''
   Some crowd members were detained, Radio Moscow said. It did not
say why the crowd had gathered or whether the demonstration was over
the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
   Baku Radio, also monitored by the BBC, said the city special
district military commandant, Col. Gen. Mikhail Tyagunov, denied
rumors that weapons were used and that bodies of victims were on
Lenin Square. ``This is a lie and is spread for the purpose of a
premeditated provocation,'' he said.
   Lenin Square was closed for ``sanitary work'' following the
dispersal of the meeting, the broadcast said.
   In Yerevan, the Armenian capital, a 10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew imposed
Nov. 24 was changed to 11 p.m.-5 a.m. as the situation there
stabilized, the Communist Party daily Pravda reported. More than
2,400 people have been detained and 32 arrested since the curfew was
imposed, Pravda said.
   The newspaper also said a special bank account had been set up in
Armenia to accept contributions for some of the 150,000 refugees who
have fled violence-torn areas.
   Since the latest round of ethnic violence broke out in November,
at least 28 deaths have been reported in Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   The dispute flared in February when the predominantly Armenian
population of Nagorn-Karabakh began agitating for annexation by
Armenia. Mass demonstrations followed in Armenia, and ethnic rioting
broke out in the city of Sumgait, Azerbaijan. At least 32 people
were killed.

<TEXT>
   A former television preacher says he told a grand
jury he had sex with Jim Bakker three times and arranged the fateful
tryst with church secretary Jessica Hahn at Bakker's urging,
according to a magazine interview.
   John Wesley Fletcher, who appeared on ``The PTL Club'' television
program from the mid-1970s to 1981, described Bakker as a bisexual
who openly lusted after the show's young male camera operators.
   ``I was Jim Bakker's male prostitute,'' he said in the interview
for January's Penthouse magazine.
   Fletcher is the second man to say publicly that he had sex with
Bakker. In September, former PTL official Jay Babcock said he had
told the grand jury of a sexual encounter with Bakker.
   Fletcher said in the interview released Sunday that he related
the sexual encounters to the federal grand jury investigating
charges that Bakker, Bakker's wife, Tammy, and PTL aide David
Taggart illegally spent contributions to the ministry on their
lavish lifestyles.
   The grand jury, meeting in Charlotte, N.C., apparently began
deliberations today after a 16-month investigation.
   Among other things, witnesses have said the jury also is
investigating whether ministry funds were used to pay $364,000 in
hush money to Ms. Hahn or to entice aides to grant Bakker homosexual
favors. The jury has been examining allegations of wire, tax and
mail fraud.
   Federal prosecutors were in the panel's meeting room for nearly
two hours this morning before returning to their offices and leaving
the grand jury alone.
   Bakker, the PTL founder, has denied in a sworn deposition that he
ever had a homosexual relationship with anyone, and has denied
charges of financial wrongdoing.
   Two attorneys for Bakker, Jim Toms and Ryan Hovis, issued this
statement Sunday in response to the Penthouse report:
   ``Sadly, some so-called journalists continue to exploit human
tragedy by stories such as the one we now understand to be in
Penthouse about Mr. Fletcher.
   ``He has lost his ministry and finances and recently has been
hospitalized. We would not want to further add to his difficulties
by commenting on the story, and simply point to where it is being
published.''
   Toms has said he believes it is only a matter of time before the
grand jury indicts Bakker.
   Fletcher said he participated in homosexual activity with Bakker
only reluctantly.
   Fletcher said he related allegations about Bakker's sexual
encounters to officials of the Assemblies of God before the
Pentecostal denomination defrocked Bakker in May 1987.
   Fletcher was removed from the Assemblies of God ministry in 1981
amid accusations of homosexual activity, the magazine said.
   Penthouse reported that Fletcher's psychiatrist confirmed he
spent a month in a hospital last spring recovering from a suicide
attempt.
   Fletcher blamed himself in the interview for setting off PTL's
sex-and-hush money scandal by introducing Hahn to Bakker, even
though he said he did so at Bakker's request. Hahn has charged that
Bakker and Fletcher raped her in a Florida hotel room; Fletcher said
in the interview that she willingly had sex.
   Fletcher also charged that Bakker often threatened suicide to
manipulate those around him and was cynical about fund-raising.
   ``Some of the little old ladies he called `Grandma Grunts,' like
here comes another pocketbook,'' Fletcher said.

<HEAD>Novelist Testifies In Support of 11 Black Activists In Treason
Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa's foremost
novelist, Nadine Gordimer, today testified in support of 11 black
activists at the start of a hearing to determine their sentences for
treason and terrorism.
   Four of the defendants, including three leaders of the country's
largest anti-apartheid group, were convicted of treason and seven of
terrorism last month after a trial that lasted more than three years.
   Two visiting U.S. Democratic senators, Sam Nunn of Georgia and
David Boren of Oklahoma, were among those crowding in a Pretoria
courtroom for today's hearing.
   Ms. Gordimer, one of several leading foes of apartheid called to
give mitigatory evidence, said she supported the goals of the ANC
and felt that its guerrilla campaign was justified.
   She said her fellow whites were to blame for stifling blacks'
non-violent protests.
   ``The time had to come that there had to be some military wing
(of the ANC),'' said Ms. Gordimer, a writer whose novels include
``July's People'' and ``Burger's Daughter.''
   The maximum penalty for treason and terrorism is death, but most
observers expect Pretoria Supreme Court Justice Kees van Dijkhorst
to impose prison sentences on the 11 black activists when the
hearing ends, possibly this week.
   In his verdict, van Dijkhorst ruled that the United Democratic
Front, a multiracial coalition formed in 1983 to seek black
political rights, was a revolutionary organization. He said the
front, which was banned in February, conspired with the outlawed
African National Congress to incite violence in 1984 aimed at making
South Africa ungovernable.
   Also testifying in support of the defendants were Professor Jakes
Gerwel, chief administrator of the predominantly mixed-race
University of the Western Cape, and Enos Mabuza, president of the
homeland of Kangwane.
   The three best-known defendants, all convicted of treason, are
Popo Molefe, 36, who was the United Democratic Front's national
secretary; Terror Lekota, 40, its publicity secretary, and Moses
Chikane, 40, secretary of its Transvaal Province branch.
   Murphy Morobe, who succeeded Lekota as the front's chief
spokesman, reportedly discussed the treason trial Sunday with the
U.S. senators, who are on a fact-finding trip.
   According to the independent South African Press Association,
Morobe told Nunn and Boren that the government was repressing young
anti-apartheid leaders while it was moving to release long-serving
political prisoners, possibly including ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   ``We do not see the moves to release older activists as an act of
benevolence on the part of the government, but rather one which
takes the attention of the world away from what is being done to the
younger people who are expected to take over the reins,'' Morobe was
quoted as saying.
   Morobe and two colleagues spent five weeks holed up in the U.S.
Consulate in Johannesburg after escaping from detention on Sept. 13.
   In another trial today, a white conscientious objecter, Charles
Bester, was convicted of refusing to serve in the armed forces and
sentenced to six years in prison. Bester, 18, told a Johannesburg
magistrate his Christian beliefs would not allow him to serve in a
force which he felt was used to maintain apartheid.
   Under apartheid, blacks have no vote in ntional affairs. The
white minority controls the government and has separate districts,
schools and health services.

<HEAD>Report Outlines Conditions For Savannah River Reactor Restart</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note language in 5th graf</NOTE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent safety committee will meet
next week to discuss the prerequisites for restarting one of the
three closed Savannah River Plant nuclear reactors, and one member
says it will be difficult to meet a target of spring or summer for
the restart.
   A Department of Energy report on the restart calls for an
unprecedented, top-to-bottom inspection of the reactor, as well as
comprehensive changes in written procedures, training and staffing
throughout the government-owned nuclear weapons fuel plant at Aiken.
   The reactors have been closed for safety reasons.
   Officials from the Energy Department and the Department of
Defense are anxious for Savannah River to resume operation because
it is the nation's only producer of tritium, a radioactive gas that
is critical for nuclear warheads.
   Pentagon experts have said that if Savannah River does not have
all three reactors operating by next summer, extraordinary steps
might be needed, including deactivating warheads and transferring
their tritium to higher-priority weapons.
   On Tuesday, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said one of the
reactors at the troubled plant would open by spring or summer.
   Elmer Schwartz, a member of an independent safety committee
established this year by Herrington, said it is possible to follow
the report's guidelines and meet the deadline, but ``it will take a
hell of an effort.''
   But some Energy Department officials and independent safety
experts believe it will take far longer, possibly extending into
early 1990, The New York Times and The State newspapers reported.
   Robert M. Keller, a senior nuclear engineer at the Energy
Department who wrote the restart plan, told the Times it may take
until December 1989 to start up the first of the reactors. The
newspaper said engineers estimated that it would take until the end
of 1990 to restart the others.
   The full safety committee is scheduled to review the start-up
criteria Dec. 13 and 14 in Washington. The plan reviewed by the
committee will be final and contain a specific target date for the
restart.
   Savannah River's three operable reactors were limited to 50
percent power in March 1987 because of concerns about the ability of
their emergency cooling systems to prevent melting of the
radioactive core during an accident.
   Once the reactors are returned to service, power levels may be
further reduced because of safety questions, The State reported.
   No matter how long the overhaul of the first reactor takes,
Schwartz and others believe the new procedures will enhance overall
safety at Savannah River and at 16 other Energy Department weapons
production facilities. Over the past eight months, each has come
under increasing public and congressional scrutiny spawned by
decades of lax safety practices.
   Energy Department officials have proposed replacing the three
aging Savannah River reactors with a $4 billion, heavy-water reactor.
   Rep. Lindsay Thomas, D-Ga., whose congressional district lies
across the state line from the Savannah River Plant, said he would
oppose funding for the new reactor because of the facility's poor
safety record. Thomas, a member of the House Appropriations
Committee, was to testify today at an Energy Department
environmental hearing in Savannah on the proposed reactor.

   Six teen-agers en route to a party were
killed when their compact car swerved in front of a pickup truck and
was crushed, police said.
   ``This is the worst wreck I've ever seen,'' John Meiners, a
safety officer with an area volunteer fire department, said after
the Friday night accident. ``I haven't seen anything like this since
I was an 18-year-old Marine in Vietnam putting bodies in
helicopters.''
   Sheriff John Raichl said there was no evidence that any of the
teen-agers had been drinking before the accident on U.S. 101 along
the northern Oregon coast.
   ``It's unbelievable in a town this size to have six kids go just
like that,'' said Art Stromsness of Hughes-Ransom Mortuary. The town
has 2,500 residents.
   The victims were identified as Debra Raappana, 19, of Clatskanie,
the driver and owner of the car; Tim Morgan, 17, of Astoria; Jason
Hurly, 16, of Hammond; and Kenneth Goin, 16, Darren Godwin, 15, and
Steven Cory Bingaman-Story, 15, all of Warrenton.
   Morgan's brother, Keith, 16, was among the first to arrive at the
accident scene. The victims had forced him to ride with some other
teens in another vehicle because the compact car was too crowded.
   ``I couldn't see anyone in there,'' he said. ``I called my
brother's name, but he didn't answer.''
   Raappana attended Clatsop Community College in Astoria and the
other five were enrolled at Warrenton High School, which has 250
students.
   Jim Hendrickson, 17, of Warrenton, a junior, knew five of the
victims. ``They were pretty nice folks,'' he said. ``They were
well-accepted in school.''
   The pickup driver, Robert John Larson, a 28-year-old U.S. Coast
Guard member from Warrenton, was treated at a hospital for cuts and
bruises and released.
   Deputy Sheriff Mark Whisler said Larson reported he barely had
time to hit the brakes before the teen-agers' car crossed his path.
Raichl said it did not appear the pickup had been speeding.

   A man on trial for beating to death his illegally
adopted daughter today asked the court for permission to change his
plea to innocent by reason of insanity. The request came in the
midst of testimony by the man's former lover.
   The lawyer for Joel Steinberg, accused of murdering 6-year-old
Lisa Steinberg, told state Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax that
new information derived from the testimony of Hedda Nussbaum
prompted the change in strategy.
   Attorney Ira London said pyschiatrists who examined Steinberg
earlier this year had initially not believed Steinberg was mentally
incapacitated, but that Ms. Nussbaum's testimony, coupled with their
interviews with the defendant, would now allow them to testify that
Steinberg lacked criminal responsibility in the girl's death.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, who lived with Steinberg for 17 years,
testified last week  I couldn't do anything for myself
and didn't know anything.''

   Communist North Korea is strongly opposed to the diplomatic link
between Hungary, its ally, and rival South Korea.
   Seoul is seeking ties with communist countries, including China

   Pope John Paul II on Monday discussed
religious freedom with the Bulgarian foreign minister, a Vatican
spokesman said.
   Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov, who is on a two-day official
visit to Italy, had a 20-minute private audience with the pope.
   The talks were held ``in the framework of normal contacts that
the Holy Father maintains with civil authorities with the aim of
guaranteeing Catholics real space for religious freedom,'' said
spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   It was Mladenov's second meeting with John Paul. The previous
visit was in December 1978.
   Navarro said there are 80,000 Roman Catholics in Bulgaria, which
has a population of 9 million.
   Freedom of religion in guaranteed by law in Bulgaria, although as
in most Soviet bloc countries, it has a state organization to
oversee religious affairs.

<TEXT>
   Actor Gary Busey, who campaigned against
mandatory helmet laws for motorcyclists, was improved but still in
critical condition today with brain injuries suffered in a
motorcycle accident.
   Busey, 44, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his
starring role in ``The Buddy Holly Story,'' was not wearing a helmet
when he was hurled from his motorcycle headfirst into a curb Sunday.
   Neurosurgeons at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center completed a two-hour
emergency operation Sunday night, removing two blood clots from the
actor's brain, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. Busey's skull was
not fractured, he said.
   ``He stabilized throughout the night; his condition is improved
but still critical,'' Wise said. ``He's able to respond to simple
commands.''
   Close relatives were at that actor's bedside, and well-wishers
were calling from across the country, Wise said.
   Busey was riding alone when he inexplicably lost control of his
motorcycle at a Culver City intersection about 10 miles west of
downtown Los Angeles, said Culver City police Sgt. Karin Reagan. He
had just left Bartel's Harley-Davidson shop, she said.
   ``He hit the curb with his head and wasn't wearing a helmet at
the time of the crash,'' she said.
   Wise said he had been told by the Busey's agent that the actor
had just picked up the bike after repairs.
   There were no obstructions in the road, and no other vehicles
were involved in the accident, which occurred shortly before noon on
a sunny day, police said.
   The actor opposed mandatory helmet laws for motorcyclists. He
appeared last month at North Hollywood's Palomino Club to raise
money to hire lobbyists in Sacramento to fight such a bill.
   The California Motorcyclist Association, which sponsored that
event, argues that untrained and unlicensed riders are in greater
danger than riders without helmets.
   The toothy, scratchy-voiced actor, who lives in Malibu with his
wife, Judy, and 17-year-old son, Jake, is one of a growing number of
celebrities leading the latest Hollywood trend of ``hog'' cruising.
   Busey's seaside neighbor Sylvester Stallone, and Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Jay Leno, Ray Sharkey, Ken Wahl and Mickey Rourke
also own hogs, the name given large Harley-Davidson motorcycles
costing up to $25,000.
   Busey earned the Academy Award nomination with his first feature
film portraying the ill-fated 1950s rock 'n' roll star in the 1978
movie ``The Buddy Holly Story.''
   Busey, a one-time aspiring rock musician himself and like Holly a
native of Texas, performed his own renditions of Holly's hit songs
in the film.
   Busey's other film credits include ``Lethal Weapon,'' ``A Star Is
Born,'' ``Carny'' and ``The Bear.'' He also starred in the 1974-75
ABC-TV comedy series ``The Texas Wheelers.''
   Busey also played one of three Malibu surfers in ``Big
Wednesday,'' and is an avid surfer himself.
   He also starred in ``A Dangerous Life,'' an HBO cable TV
miniseries broadcast last week.
   Busey played a television reporter caught up in the Philippine
revolution that deposed Ferdinand Marcos in favor or President
Corazon Aquino.
   He won a 1987 ACE award for cable television as best actor in a
drama series for an episode of HBO's ``The Hitchhiker.''
   Busey grew up in Goose Creek, Texas, and attended college in
Kansas and Oklahoma. He overcame well-publicized drug and eating
addictions that temporarily stalled his career.
   In an interview 2{ years ago, he said quit using cocaine and
other stimulants, and had lost 55 pounds.
   He said he became a heavy drug user after his success with ``The
Buddy Holly Story.''
   ``I was up for an Academy Award my first time out of the chute,''
he said. ``That breeds insecurity. ... How was I to come up to those
expectations again? I was wondering if I was a flash in the pan.''

<TEXT>
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu says George
Bush will maintain his interest in Western and environmental issues
after he becomes president because he has had a ``lifelong love
affair with the outdoors.''
   ``I think you are going to see a lot of attention paid by George
Bush to outdoor issues,'' Sununu, the president-elect's choice for
chief of staff, said over the weekend during a break from skiing.
   Sununu, who will assume his new post when Bush takes office in
January, spent several days skiing at the Vail and Beaver Creek
resorts in the Rocky Mountains and visiting with friends. Though New
Hampshire has its share of ski areas, most are not yet open for the
season.
   He said the Bush administration hopes to strike a balance between
the concerns of environmentalists and the nation's need to use
natural resources.
   ``It's a shame in this country that, during the political season,
some of the constituency groups have a natural affinity for one
party or the other,'' he said. ``It is difficult for Republicans to
wean environmental groups away from the Democrats.''
   A recent meeting between Bush and environmentalists was just the
beginning of a dialogue between the two, he said.
   ``Since the election, they've had a chance to look at the reality
of Bush's background and what he wants to accomplish,'' Sununu said.
   Sununu said he plans to make a special effort to see that Bush
gets input from regular citizens as well as Washington insiders.
   ``We will have an outreach effort to keep in touch with the
states, the communities and individual citizens,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Police have arrested two women in connection
with the suspicious deaths of eight nursing home residents whom
authorities originally believed had died of natural causes.
   Both women are former employees of the Alpine Manor Nursing Home,
where authorities say eight residents may have been suffocated in
their beds.
   Walker Police Chief Walter Sprenger declined to speculate on the
motive during a news conference today.
   ``A lot of this will come out during the trial,'' Sprenger said.
``I cannot share evidence that will be detrimental to the case.''
   He said the results of autopsies conducted on two bodies that
were exhumed were inconclusive.
   Police in this Grand Rapids suburb arrested a 26-year-old Grand
Rapids woman early today and were holding her in the Kent County
Jail, Deputy Thomas Zlydaszyk said.
   A 25-year-old woman was arrested late Sunday in Tyler, Texas, and
was being held in the Smith County Jail, Sheriff Jay B. Smith said
today.
   Authorities in both counties withheld the women's names pending
arraignment.
   The Grand Rapids Press reported today that the women lived
together while working at the nursing home, according to the
ex-husband of the Grand Rapids woman and other friends and former
co-workers. The woman in Texas worked as a nurse's aide at a
hospital until recently, the newspaper said.
   The eight deaths being investigated occurred during the first
half of 1987. At the time, their deaths were considered natural and
no autopsies were done.
   The Texas woman worked at the home from June 1986 to June 1987,
according to Ginny Seyferth, spokeswoman for Alpine Manor. The Grand
Rapids woman worked there from July 1985 to October 1988 and most
recently was a supervisor of nurse's aides, Seyferth said.
   The state Department of Public Health said Sunday it also was
investigating the Alpine deaths as standard procedure in cases of
unusual occurrences that involve patients, said Walter Wheeler III,
acting chief of the bureau of health facilities.
   Sprenger confirmed Saturday that the investigation had expanded
to cover eight deaths.
   Police said earlier that the investigation was limited to the
deaths of Marguerite Chambers, 60, and Edith Cook, 98, whose bodies
underwent autopsies after being exhumed last week.
   About 40 patients died at the nursing home during January-April
1987, when the eight suspicious deaths occurred, Seyferth said
Sunday.
   Sprenger said detectives began investigating the deaths in early
October, using a list of ``eight potential victims'' provided by a
source he refused to identify.
   ``We've continued on because we are convinced that something has
occurred,'' Sprenger said, adding that police were investigating
reports that some victims had been suffocated.
   Sprenger said at least one other body might be exhumed. Three of
the eight were cremated.

<TEXT>
   Soviet inspectors stood by today as a lack
of wind put on hold the initial burning of Pershing missile motors
at this military facility on the eastern plains of Colorado.
   The Colorado State Health Department permit for destruction of
the missile motors requires a minimum 4 mph wind from the west to
disperse fumes from the burning rocket fuel and drive it away from
the city of Pueblo, located several miles to the west.
   ``We are waiting on the wind and are in a holding pattern. Once
the wind picks up we'll go ahead,'' said Sgt. Brian Lodermeier at
the Pueblo Army Depot.
   The first burn, of two missile motors, had been scheduled for 10
a.m.
   Earlier, a Soviet inspector said his team's presence at the
missiles' destruction shows ``real disarmament'' in action.
   The 10 inspectors arrived Sunday to oversee the destruction of 18
Pershing missile motors at the Pueblo military depot.
   ``People can now face the future with optimism,'' Anatoly
Samakin, the Soviets' chief inspector, said Sunday.
   ``The Soviet-American treaty marks the beginning of real
disarmament.''
   The Pershing missiles were the delivery systems for
European-based nuclear warheads aimed at the Soviet Union. Under
terms of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty that took
effect June 1, the United States has two years to destroy 450
missiles; in turn, the Soviet Union will destroy a larger number of
their intermediate-range missiles as U.S. inspection teams watch.
   This is the first missile destruction under Soviet inspection to
occur at the depot here. Pershing missiles have been destroyed at
the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas, since Sept
8. Cruise missiles were destroyed in October at an Air Force base in
Arizona.
   Navy Cmdr. Kendell Pease, one of the Soviet delegation's escort
officers, said the Soviets were expected to remain in Pueblo for two
weeks. He said they will be permitted to dine in restaurants and go
shopping, but with an escort.
   The Soviet inspectors' visit is their third to Pueblo since the
INF treaty was ratified, but the first time they are are staying at
a hotel instead of at the depot.
   The Colorado Health Department, after a lengthy environmental
review, gave the Army permission to conduct the burns for three
years. Because of air pollution problems, no more than six missiles
can be burned per day. The burns can only take place during the day
and when the wind is at least 4 mph from the west.

   Salvador Dali was transferred from the
intensive care unit to a room Monday, a week after he was
hospitalized because of heart trouble and blood clots in his lungs.
   The 84-year-old painter ``continues to improve favorably'' and he
was no longer receiving medication intravenously, according to his
doctors.
   Dr. Juan Garcia San Miguel said complications still could arise,
but ``the possibility he could suffer a setback is greatly reduced.''
   King Juan Carlos visited Dali briefly Monday at the Quiron
Clinic. The monarch said Dali told him he was hoping to get well
enough to return to painting.
   The artist was taken to the clinic Nov. 28 from a hospital in his
hometown of Figueras, 60 miles north of Barcelona. He had entered
Figueras hospital the previous day suffering from pneumonia.
   Dali has been in poor health since 1984, when a fire broke out in
the bedroom of his Pubol Castle residence in La Pera, 40 miles south
of Figueras.
   After leaving the hospital three months later, Dali moved to his
Galatea Tower mansion attached to his Theater-Museum in Figueras.
   He received a pacemaker in 1986.
   Dali, a founder of the surrealist movement, is the last living
member of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that
included Pablo Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who died a
decade later.

<TEXT>
   A wispy, white-haired man living in a
remote village believes he is 149 years old, The Times of India
reported Monday.
   Kellabhai Navrabhai Rathwa was surrounded by five generations of
his family when he was interviewed in Borkhad, 500 miles southwest
of New Delhi, the newspaper said.
   The 1989 Guinness Book of World Records lists the authenticated
longevity record of 120 years, 237 days, for Shigechiyo Izumi of
Japan, who died in 1986.
   The Times of India said the illiterate farmer reckons his age by
the region's great famine of 1856, when his mother told him he would
have to leave home.
   The newspaper reporter pointed out that Rathwa's mother was
hardly likely to know his age in an area where even today parents
cannot precisely relate their children's ages.
   ``I could not have been less than 16 years, otherwise I would not
have been paid the wages paid to an adult laborer then _ eight annas
per day,'' Rathwa said.
   An anna, a coin that has been out of circulation for three
decades, would be worth 3 cents today.
   Rathwa, father of 22 children, said he chopped trees and helped
build roads until the famine passed.
   The Times said Rathwa's memory was sharp, but because of the
isolation of his village he was unaware of great events. He did not
know that World War I and World War II had happened and had no
concept of a bomb.
   But he had heard of Bombay, the metropolis 220 miles south,
because ``those white-skinned men who once ruled the land of India''
used to hunt near his village.
   He said a nearby narrow-gauge railroad was laid ``only
recently.'' Records show the track is more than 60 years old.
   The Times said Rathwa walked with the help of a cane and his
vision was blurred but his hearing was perfect and most of his teeth
were intact.

   Grave diggers, clerks, garbage collectors
and other public employees went back to work Monday after a two-week
strike that crippled this Sicilian capital.
   The strike closed schools in the absence of city-employed
janitors, affected traffic control, and halted the issuing of birth
certificates. Newborn babies were left stranded in hospitals because
under Italian law they cannot be released without the certificates.
   The strike ended after unions urged workers to return to their
jobs pending a Dec. 14 decision on their demands by a provincial
commission.
   The strike began 13 days ago because of a dispute over the
schedule of retroactive pay to city employees. A court ruled the
payments should be made in installments over a 24-month period, but
employees demanded they be paid over a 12-month period.

<HEAD>Carlucci Says Iran Learned `Terrorism at Sea Doesn't Pay'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD USS LA SALLE IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. forces were a
key to halting the Persian Gulf war and taught Iran ``terrorism on
the high seas does not pay political dividends,'' Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci said Monday.
   He delivered the message at an awards ceremony aboard the La
Salle, flagship of the U.S. Navy task force, and repeated it during
a brief news conference on the third day of a four-day gulf tour.
   In answer to a question, Carlucci defended the U.S. denial of a
visa for Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat to
address the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The assembly session
will move to Geneva as a result.
   Arab gulf states joined a ``not surprisingly negative reaction''
to the decision by U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, he said,
but added that none had raised the issue during his trip. Shultz
refused the visa on grounds Arafat condones terrorism.
   Carlucci came here from Oman was to visit Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
before returning to Washington on Wednesday.
   He delivered a personal message from President Reagan to Sheik
Isa bin Salman al Khalifa, emir of Bahrain, and confered with Sheik
Khalifa bin Ahmed al Khalifa, the defense minister, who met him at
the airport.
   They discussed ``bilateral relations and issues of common
interest,'' the official Gulf News Agency reported.
   U.S. sources said privately the Bahrainis registered displeasure
about the Arafat visa controversy by what one called a
``downgrading'' of protocol ``so subtle that only the U.S.
government is likely to notice it.''
   The source said the message was conveyed mainly by the fact that
Carlucci was met by the defense minister rather than the crown
prince, Sheik Hamad bin Isa bin Salman al Khalifa, who had greeted
him in January.
   Carlucci said events that culminated in the Aug. 20 truce in the
8-year-old war between Iran and Iraq vindicated the U.S. decision to
have a strong naval presence in the gulf.
   ``Results speak for themselves,'' he told officers and crew
assembled on the La Salle's flight deck.
   ``Through your actions, in large measure, you have helped bring
an end to one of the bloodiest wars in history,'' he said.
   ``We have succeeded in convincing Iran that terrorism on the high
seas does not pay political dividends. We have demonstrated that we
can stand by our friends, and we have demonstrated that we know who
our friends are.''
   He said the largest U.S. naval operation since Vietnam also
``demonstrated to the world our ablity to project power, to show
determination and to defend vital principles including the principle
of freedom of navigation.''
   At the news conference, Carlucci said those actions ``in turn .
.. contributed to a substantial degree to the cease-fire'' and to
``maintaining the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz,''
gateway to the Persian Gulf.
   All four gulf states on Carlucci's itinerary have provided some
support to the U.S. effort to keep commercial shipping lanes open
and discourage Iranian threats and attacks.
   Some European navies are pulling out of the gulf, but Carlucci
indicated the United States was in no rush to reduce its forces,
which have been trimmed by two ships to 25 since the truce.
   He said the Pentagon was ``not talking about any specific
drawdown'' and had ``set no numerical targets.''
   ``What we want to do is remain alert and ready, until we're
confident that the cease-fire will take hold,'' he said, and with
U.N.-sponsored peace talks ``going very slowly ... we think it is
prudent for us to maintain a fairly good presence in the gulf until
there are some further developments.''
   Carlucci presented achievement awards to four sailors: Seaman
Kenneth P. Gross of Keewatin, Minn.; Chief Warrant Officer 4 Gary L.
Pugh of Corvallis, Ore.; Quartermaster 2 Terry D. Yarbrough of
Memphis, Tenn., and Intelligence Specialist 2 Ronald S. Fry Jr. of
Miami.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   PUNITIVE-DAMAGE AWARDS
   
   The court set the stage for an important ruling on the
constitutionality of enormous punitive-damage awards that have
become increasingly common in a range of lawsuits.
   The justices agreed to study the issue in an appeal by
Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., a waste collection business with
headquarters in Houston. The company was ordered to pay $6 million
to a Burlington, Vt., competitor that accused the Texas company of
undercutting its prices in an effort to drive it out of business.
   The case is Browning-Ferris vs. Kelco Disposal, 88-556.
   
   LAWYERS FEES
   
   The court agreed to hear a Reagan administration appeal aimed at
limiting recovery of lawyers' fees for people who win disputes with
the government over Social Security benefits.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the government
reimburse attorneys' fees for an Alabama woman who won disability
benefits.
   The case is Bowen vs. Hudson, 88-616.
   
   TEXTBOOKS
   
   The court refused to revive a $70,000 award to a Tennessee woman
who said her rights were violated in a dispute with public school
officials over ``godless'' textbooks.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Vicki Frost, a
Christian fundamentalist briefly arrested for refusing to leave
school grounds during an attempt to remove her daughter from a
reading class.
   The case is Frost vs. Hawkins County Board, 88-604.
   
   ABA
   
   The court agreed to decide whether a federal law allowing public
scrutiny of governmental advisory groups applies to the American Bar
Association's role in picking federal judges.
   The court said it will review a ruling that shields the ABA's
judicial selection committee from the law.
   The cases are Public Citizen vs. Justice Department, 88-429, and
Washington Legal Foundation vs. Justice Department, 88-494.
   
   SOBRIETY TESTS
   
   The court refused to bar police from conducting roadside sobriety
tests by setting up checkpoints at unannounced locations.
   The court, by a 7-2 vote, let stand a ruling from California that
such tests for drunken driving do not violate the rights of
motorists.
   The case is Richard T. vs. California, 88-318.
   
   GUN BATTLE
   
   The court refused to revive a lawsuit seeking money for six
injured FBI agents and for the families of two agents killed in a
Miami gun battle with two men who also died.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the agents
and their families should be allowed to use a federal
anti-racketerring law to recover damages from the estates of the two
alleged criminals.
   The case is Grogan vs. Platt, 88-650.
   
   SEABROOK
   
   The court barred a New Hampshire community from removing poles
bearing sirens that could alert townspeople about an accident at the
controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that limits the
power of cities to revoke licenses for the poles.
   The case is Rye vs. Public Service of New Hampshire, 88-621.
   
   INSURANCE TAXES
   
   The court agreed to resolve conflicting decisions by federal
appeals courts in a tax dispute between the Internal Revenue Service
and the life insurance industry.
   The court said it will decide whether the ``ceding commissions''
a life insurance company pays when reinsuring another firm's
policies may be claimed as tax deductions for the year they are paid.
   The case is Colonial American vs. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 88-396.
   
   INDIANS
   
   The court asked the Justice Department for its views on whether
states may prosecute non-Indians accused of crimes against Indians
on tribal reservations.
   The court invited government lawyers to comment on an appeal by
Arizona officials seeking to prosecute a non-Indian school teacher
accused of sexual relations with Indian boys on a Navajo reservation.
   The case is Arizona vs. Flint, 88-603.

   The crew of space shuttle Atlantis
successfully deployed a powerful radar satellite over the weekend,
reportedly the chief goal of the clandestine military mission,
knowledgeable sources said today.
   The $500 million Lacrosse satellite reportedly was designed to
gather extremely sharp all-weather images of Eastern Bloc military
targets and would help American intelligence agencies monitor Soviet
compliance with arms control treaties.
   The sources, who requested anonymity, said the satellite was
operating well as it followed a course that carries it over 80
percent of the Soviet Union.
   They also reported that Atlantis was expected to return to Earth
Tuesday afternoon, landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has said it would
provide 24 hours advance notice of a landing time.
   As word about the satellite was reported, Atlantis' five
astronauts were beginning the fourth day of their mission and NASA
and the Air Force were keeping a tight lid on information about
their activities.
   Before today, there had been no in-flight information leaked to
news agencies as it was on two earlier Defense Department shuttle
missions.
   ``It seems the Air Force and NASA have learned how to plug the
leaks,'' said one official Sunday, on condition he not be named.
   Sources had said before Friday's launch from Cape Canaveral that
the flight would end today or Tuesday unless the crew needed more
time to deploy the radar satellite or to conduct other
military-oriented experiments.
   At Edwards, a ground crew Sunday conducted a simulated shuttle
landing, an exercise normally done a day or two before a mission
ends. But there was no announcement of a landing.
   Plans for the next shuttle flight, set for Feb. 18, received a
setback last week when part of a rocket for boosting a
communications satellite into orbit from the shuttle was badly
damaged.
   A worker bumped into the nozzle on the rocket's first stage and
cracked it during during pre-launch checks Thursday, and the entire
first stage will be replaced, said NASA spokesman George Diller.
   Testing was to have begun Dec. 10 on the combined first and
second stages of the two-stage booster, he said. The tests will be
delayed until about Dec. 27, he said, and technicians probably would
have to work two shifts a day seven days a week to maintain the
launch schedule for the Discovery's mission, he said.
   The satellite deployed by the Atlantis' crew reportedly is to
serve someday as the ``radar eye'' for the new B-2 stealth bomber,
selecting potential targets. That would eliminate the need for the
aircraft to use its own radar, which might disclose its location.
   The astronauts also reportedly were to conduct several
experiments aimed at defining man's role as an observer in space,
with emphasis on reconnaissance. It was believed they were to test a
new optical device that resembles binoculars.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson commands the flight. The other crew
members are Col. Richard M. Mullane, Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner and Lt.
Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force and Navy Cmdr. William M.
Shepherd.
   The mission is the 27th in the shuttle program, the third
dedicated solely to the military and the second since the 1986
Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts and halted flights
for 32 months.

   The president gave Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
another three weeks to form a government, urging him Monday to forge
a coalition with Labor and reform a complex system that has produced
two stalemated elections.
   President Chaim Herzog said Israel's political parties are
bargaining for position while political and economic problems
approach crisis proportions.
   His appeal for national unity came after three weeks of political
jockeying by Shamir's rightist Likud bloc, the rival center-left
Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and small
ultra-Orthodox religious parties.
   Shamir and Peres have been equal partners in a ``national unity''
since inconclusive 1984 elections, and traded jobs two years ago. In
the Nov. 1 elections, Likud won 40 of the 120 parliament seats and
Labor got 39.
   Speaking at the ceremony at his residence in which he gave Shamir
the extension, Herzog said the new government should change Israel's
electoral system, which resulted in parliament seats for 15 parties
Nov. 1 but left no party with a majority.
   ``There is no parallel in the democratic world for our odd and
incomprehensible system,'' Herzog said with Shamir at his side.
   ``I believe that I speak for the great majority of Israel's
people when I express a sense of frustration, helplessness,
humiliation and shame, as well as grave concern.''
   Of anti-religious sentiment resulting from demands by
ultra-Orthodox parties for special laws and regulations in exchange
for joining a coalition, Herzog said: ``Confused and dangerous
emotions are being aroused. ... There are attitudes that recall the
dark days of anti-Jewish persecution.''
   He recommended another Likud-Labor coalition, although Shamir has
been edging in recent days toward a narrow government with small
right-wing and Orthodox factions. Religious parties won a total of
18 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
   Herzog said: ``I shall repeat what I said three weeks ago: the
state of Israel needs a broad government. It must have a stable
government if it is to stand up to the perils and challenges which
face it.''
   Peres agreed with the president about reform. ``After each
election ... the major parties, instead of arguing between them
about the central issues, compete for the support of the religious
parties,'' he said. ``This is absurd. We must change the system.''
   Shamir would not speak with reporters after meeting with Herzog.
   He has lined up 65 of the 120 Knesset seats with the support of
small parties but his 21-day mandate ran out Monday and he requested
an extension, as allowed by law.
   Religious parties have demanded a law that would recognize only
conversions to Judaism made by Orthodox rabbis, which the
Conservative and Reform movements oppose. They also want important
Cabinet posts and strict enforcement of the Jewish sabbath.
   Agudat Israel, a relgious party with five Knesset seats, kept the
entire country waiting Sunday night while its spiritual mentors, the
Torah Sages, decided whether to honor an agreement signed with Labor
last week. They broke it, opening the way for a Likud government.
   The popular tabloid Yediot Ahronot published a list Monday of 17
promises it said Likud made to Agudat Israel, including three
ministries, the powerful position of Parliament Finance Committee
chairman and pledges to ban abortion and advertisements featuring
scantily clad women.
   Editorial cartoonists have skewered the religious parties almost
daily.
   A cartoon in the Yediot Ahronot showed a tank topped by the black
hat traditionally worn by the ultra-Orthodox, its cannon pointed at
Peres and Shamir. The caption said: ``Your money ... and your soul.''

   President Roh Tae-woo called for law
and order Monday after naming a new Cabinet, indicating his
government will crack down on violent protesters.
   ``Democracy means order, not confusion. It is the people's wish
that the government's just public power must be established,'' Roh
told his new Cabinet.
   In the most extensive reorganization since he took office in
February, Roh named a new premier and replaced 19 Cabinet ministers
Monday.
   But opponents said he failed to purge the government of the
``dictatorial'' legacy of his disgraced predecessor Chun Doo-hwan.
   It seemed unlikely the much-heralded changes would have a major
impact on public opinion or help still widespread demands for Chun's
punishment.
   Roh said the new Cabinet's first priority is to maintain law and
order by taking a resolute stand on ``leftist and terrorist groups''
_ official shorthand for violent anti-government forces.
   He named retired general and former ambassador to Britain Kang
Young-hoon as prime minister and replaced all but three of his
ministers in an effort to appease raging public anger over Chun and
show his commitment to democratic reforms.
   Kang said his main concern is to wipe out ``excessive
authoritarianism'' that marked the Chun government.
   The shuffle affected several Cabinet-level posts, including the
promotion of Seoul Olympic organizer Park Seh-jik to head the main
intelligence organization, the Agency for National Security Planning.
   Government officials, requesting anonymity, said Roh is expected
to revamp the leadership of his Democratic Justice Party in the next
few days and remove some Chun confidants.
   Presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung said the changes would
``ensure further democratic reforms and put the mind of the public
at rest following the anxiety created by problems of the past era.''
   But opposition parties showed disappointment in appointments of
what they called ``hardline rightists'' from the governing party.
   They said Roh has not fulfilled promises to cut ties with Chun's
authoritarian government.
   ``We are surprised that the new Cabinet includes persons who
actively supported dictatorship,'' said Lee Sang-soo, spokesman for
Kim Dae-jung's main opposition Party for Peace and Democracy.
   The Democratic Reunification Party said, ``We are skeptical about
the government's intention to liquidate the Chun government.''
   Opposition leaders are especially critical of keeping in the
Cabinet Administration Minister Kim Yong-gap, whom they consider
``ultra-rightist.'' Most dismissed ministers were little-known.
   Dissident groups that have organized violent protests demanding
Chun's arrest and Roh's overthrow, dismissed the Cabinet changes as
a deception to continue military-backed rule.
   Among major appointments:
   _ Cho Sung, a university economics professor and champion of
balanced economic development, was named economic planning minister.
Analysts said his appointment could signal a shift to more balanced
distribution of wealth.
   Former Gen. Lee Sang-hoon was named defense minister despite
previous government hints the key ministry would go to a civilian.
Lee filled top military posts under Chun.
   _ Legislator Lee Han-dong, who ran the governing party under
Chun, was made home minister with control of police.
   _ Huh Hyong-koo, a former prosecutor-general under Chun, was
named justice minister.

   Airmen posing as
incapacitated astronauts were rescued from a mock smoke-filled
shuttle during a simulated landing for ground crews awaiting
Atlantis' return from space.
   ``Our purpose is to make sure we're ready for the real thing _
whenever it is,'' said Chuck Spern, who directed Sunday's exercise
as shuttle recovery convoy commander for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   NASA and the Air Force said they would give 24 hours advance
notice before Atlantis and its five-member crew end a secret
military mission by touching down at this Mojave Desert base 80
miles north of Los Angeles.
   There was no announcement by midday today, but sources at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., where the shuttle was launched, said today that
Atlantis would land Tuesday afternoon, four days after the mission
began.
   A list of landing-related tasks displayed during a briefing for
Sunday's simulation said the actual landing would be four to seven
days after the launch.
   Sunday's mock landing was conducted as Atlantis' astronauts
continued the classified flight. The sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said they successfully deployed what is believed to be
a $500 million radar satellite that will spy on Soviet bloc nations
and guide the new B-2 stealth bomber.
   The extra security for the shuttle mission was apparent during
the simulation. The Air Force refused to let reporters and
photographers accompany the recovery convoy. During a briefing
before the exercise, convoy members were warned not to carry
personal cameras and to keep radio chatter to a minimum.
   About 130 members of the convoy slowly drove some two dozen
vehicles onto the hard clay of Rogers Dry Lake as the landing
exercise began. They were joined by 50 military police officers,
although 250 will be on hand for the real landing, said Col. Rich
Tillstrom, the Air Force's site commander.
   A mysterious Defense Department vehicle accompanied the usual
convoy vehicles: fire trucks, vans to transport astronauts and check
for toxic and explosive gases, a trailer with a vapor-dispersing
fan, the shuttle tow tug, and trucks to cool the shuttle and purge
it of fumes.
   Spern said only that the vehicle was unique to Atlantis'
classified mission. Lt. Col. Jerry Guess, an Air Force spokesman,
declined to identify the type of vehicle or its purpose.
   About an hour after the convoy headed onto the lakebed,
simulation participants were told the shuttle made a normal landing.
A full-scale shuttle nose cone and crew module, hauled atop a truck,
carried airmen portraying astronauts.
   Then officials controlling the simulation declared a ``mode six''
emergency in which ``there is smoke in the cabin and the crew is
incapacitated _ they can't see and are having trouble breathing,''
Spern said.
   Air Force teams then rushed to the mock shuttle, extracted the
fake astronauts, carried them on stretchers to a triage area 500
feet from the nose cone, pretended to provide emergency medical care
and then loaded them on two helicopters for what would be a ride to
a hospital.
   ``It's just practice,'' Tillstrom said. ``We go through the same
checklist and sequence of events we do for a landing, plus we take
the opportunity to practice emergency procedures.''
   Weather forecasts in the Mojave appeared favorable for a landing,
with Air Force meteorologists predicting high scattered clouds,
light and variable wind, clear visibility and high temperatures in
the 60s well into the week.
   Atlantis, which was launched Friday on the second post-Challenger
disaster shuttle flight, is expected to return to Kennedy Space
Center in Florida about five days after it lands. As usual, it will
ride piggyback aboard a modified Boeing 747 jet.

   Car bombs exploded today near Syrian army
checkpoints in the capital and the Bekaa Valley, killing one person
and injuring at least nine, police said.
   Six civilians were injured and one was killed when a car packed
with about 110 pounds of TNT exploded at 2:20 p.m. in front of
Baydoun Hospital in Moslem west Beirut, police said.
   Three people were injured at 1:30 p.m., police said, when a car
exploded near a Syrian army checkpoint in the village of Saadnayel,
24 miles east of Beirut.
   The police spokesman said the car that blew up in the village
also contained about 110 pounds of TNT.
   The hospital took the brunt of the explosion in Beirut. A nurse,
who refused to give her name, said the force of the blast hurled
most of the 36 patients out of their beds as shrapnel tore through
the windows.
   ``Luckily there were no operations under way,'' she said. ``The
explosion would have definitely shaken the hands of the surgeons,
which could have affected the lives of the patients.''
   None of the Syrian troops manning a checkpoint about 75 yards
from the hospital was injured, police said. The soldiers cordoned
off the area after the explosion as the wounded were taken to the
American University Hospital about six blocks away.
   The explosions were the 19th and 20th car bombings in Lebanon
this year. Police have said 115 people were killed and 279 wounded
in the previous car bombings.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sparkling white C-130s with bright red
crosses on their sides brought supplies to starving southern
Sudanese on Monday in an airlift made possible by relaxed tensions
in the country's long civil war.
   The airlift, organized by the International Committee of the Red
Cross, marked the first time since an anti-government rebellion
began in early 1983 that planes flew with guarantees from both sides
that they wouldn't be shot at.
   All of southern Sudan, an area as large as the state of Texas, is
in the grip of famine caused by the war.
   During the airlift, which began Sunday and is open-ended, planes
flew from Khartoum to government-held Wau, the main town of the
southern Bahr el-Ghazal region 625 miles southwest of Khartoum,
carrying sorghum, butter, cooking oil and medical supplies. They
also flew from a Kenyan border post to towns under control of the
Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   Simultaneously, an operation sponsored by agencies of the United
Nations and the Sudanese government also was under way, ferrying
relief on smaller planes to Aweil, a government-held town north of
Wau. Officials said it too had guarantees from both sides.
   Western diplomats and U.N. and other relief officials agreed the
airlifts resulted from a slight relaxation of tensions between the
two sides in the bitter war.
   The clearest evidence is an interim peace agreement signed
between rebel chieftain John Garang and the spiritual leader of the
ruling coalition's junior partner, the Democratic Unionist Party.
The agreement led to a flurry of contacts between the government and
rebels trying to convene a constitutional convention by the end of
this month.
   Despite the green light given by both sides, officials said crews
of the Hercules cargo planes were under orders to fly at over 14,000
feet, out of the range of rebel gunners, and to make circuitous
landing approaches.
   ``The crew was tense on the first day, but everything went all
right,'' one relief official said Monday. ``The planes landed okay
in Wau today as well.''
   Until now, Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's government had refused
to approve any airlifts to rebel-held places.
   Similarly, the Sudan People's Liberation Army has accused the
government of using civilian and relief planes to transport military
equipment. They have shot down at least three civilian planes,
killing more than 73 civilians, and air traffic over the south has
been limited almost completely to military aircraft.
   Preliminary reports from the area indicate the populations of
both government-held towns and those in rebel hands, which had
swelled immensely because of displaced people, have begun to shrink
since the rainy season ended in October.
   A U.N. relief official said movement was more difficult during
the rainy season and the army holds more control over the
countryside after the rains.
   ``Another unfortunate factor is that a lot of these people have
already died,'' the official said. ``It is never too late, but we
are pretty late.''
   ``There are no more daily deaths, but we are also about two
months too late to see the real tragedy,'' another relief official
said of the town of Aweil.
   Western relief officials estimate at least 260,000 people have
died this year alone as they sought refuge from the fighting.
   ``In 1988, only a few drops of relief went to the south, and
that's why the death toll was so steep,'' one official said. ``We
hope this breakthrough will open the door for other agencies to go
in.''
   All Western diplomats and relief workers interviewed refused to
give their names because of the government's sensitivity about the
operation and the war.
   Officials close to the Red Cross airlift said organizers plan to
continue the relief effort, assuming the security arrangements hold,
until 10,000 tons of relief food warehoused in Port Sudan on the
country's Red Sea coast are distributed.
   The Kenyan part of the operation is working from Lokichokio, just
south of the Sudanese border, sending food to several rebel-held
towns on smaller planes.
   Red Cross officials have not divulged the cost of the operation,
but other sources said it is about $2 million. The Red Cross is
expected to launch an international appeal soon to collect money to
continue the airlift.

   Thirteen dolphins trained for a secret Navy
program have died in the last two years, rather than the four
disclosed by trainers last month, according to government records
cited by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
   Medical reports for the Navy's Marine Mammal Program during
1986-88 reveal that five of the 13 dolphins died soon after being
transported from one naval facility to another, the newspaper
reported Monday.
   Nearly half the dolphins suffered from lack of appetite or
stomach ulcers before their deaths, the reports revealed. Other
causes included hepatitis and pneumonia.
   The Navy has used dolphins, sea lions and beluga whales in
classified programs since the 1960s, and is planning to expand the
use of dolphins for security at the Trident submarine base at
Bangor, west of Seattle.
   The Army Corps of Engineers granted a permit on Nov. 17 for the
Navy to build 16 dolphin holding pens at a pier on Hood Canal.
   The service has come under sharp criticism since several trainers
reported Nov. 2 that the animals had suffered physical abuse and
that the program suffered from mismanagement, rapid employee
turnover and pressure to expand.
   The Navy released the dolphin necropsy or animal autopsy reports
for 1986-88 to the Post-Intelligencer under the federal Freedom of
Information Act, the newspaper said. Each time a marine mammal in
its custody dies, the Navy is required to conduct a necropsy to find
the cause.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, said that when
officials earlier confirmed the deaths of four dolphins they were
not trying to cover up the deaths of others.
   ``We responded to questions (from reporters) seeking confirmation
about the four deaths,'' Quigley said.
   The Navy said it had no reports of dolphins being injured by
trainers or Navy operators, said Navy Capt. E.G. Schweizer,
commander of the Naval Ocean Systems Center.
   However, Rick Trout, a San Diego-based dolphin trainer, claimed
that in addition to minor physical abuse and adversive training
procedures, he knew of one Navy dolphin that had been blinded in one
eye and ``retired'' to Hawaii.
   Quigley defended the Navy program. ``Our mortality rate is
approximately 5 percent over the life of the program,'' he said.
``The dolphins in our program still have a longer life span that
that of the average in the wild.''
   Figures show that 31 dolphins died at the Navy center from 1972
to 1985, for an annual average of 2.3 deaths. But 12 died in 1987
and 1988, for an average of six deaths per year.
   Eight of the 13 dolphins that died were from a Naval Ocean
Systems Center laboratory in Kailua, Hawaii.

<HEAD>Decision to Scrap Social Security Proposal Hailed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs5th graf pvs, Rep. Tom, to CORRECT Downey's subcommittee</NOTE>

   A Social Security official assured Congress
today that the agency has permanently shelved a controversial
proposal to restrict people's rights to appeal benefit denials.
   The staff proposal has ``been tossed,'' said Louis Enoff, deputy
commissioner for programs at the Social Security Administration. It
``will not be considered or ... officially be brought forward in the
Social Security Administration.''
   Enoff testified today at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing
that was scheduled before Social Security Commissioner Dorcas Hardy
killed the proposal over the weekend.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said the
hearing was held anyway because the thrust of the plan had been
contrary to congressional intent that the appeals process be
``non-adversarial and simple enough for an individual claimant to
navigate without legal representation.''
   Rep. Tom Downey, acting chairman of the panel's public assistance
subcommittee, said the hearing on a draft proposal already withdrawn
went forward in part because ``the (Reagan) administration does not
have a track record on Social Security that I feel comfortable with.
... There's suspicion.''
   On Saturday, Hardy rejected the proposal, which would have
required claimants to submit all evidence in advance of their appeal
hearing.
   Most of the 300,000 people who request hearings each year before
administrative law judges are seeking disability benefits, and most
who appeal denials eventually win.
   ``It's great that they decided not to go forward with the
proposal,'' said Eileen P. Sweeney of the National Senior Citizens
Law Center. But she called it ``basically a political decision'' and
said it was ``fairly disingenuous'' of Social Security officials to
claim that the proposal had emanated from low levels of the agency
without the knowledge of Hardy or other top officials.
   Hardy said in a four-page statement released Saturday that the
draft had ``generated inaccurate information and caused undue alarm
to the American public.''
   She said she remains convinced that the agency's hearings and
appeals process needs reform, but that the staff-suggested proposal
would not have made the system ``more equitable, compassionate and
efficient.''
   The furor erupted last month when The New York Times reported
that the Reagan administration was considering restricting the right
of Social Security applicants to introduce new evidence upon appeal.
   Thirty-five senators, including one Republican, Dave Durenberger
of Minnesota, sent a letter to President-elect George Bush last week
urging him to repudiate the policy change.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he was pleased with
Hardy's decision, and hopes to work with the commissioner on
improving the system.
   It takes an average of nearly two years to appeal a claim through
the administrative process to the federal courts.
   Hardy said 80 percent of Social Security beneficiaries now are
represented by lawyers at hearings before administrative law judges,
and the agency each year ``pays almost $100 million in fees to
attorneys out of the past due benefits of claimants who win benefits
on appeal.''
   The proposal drafted by the agency's Office of Hearings and
Appeals would have required claimants to submit all evidence at
least seven days prior to a hearing before an administrative law
judge.
   The controversy hit at a time when Hardy is under consideration
for the post of secretary of health and human services in the Bush
administration.
   Hardy said that ``because confidence in our policy-making process
has been questioned, I removed the draft proposal from the routine
process and personally reviewed it.''
   ``I believe that SSA (the Social Security Administration) can do
better and have, therefore, rejected it,'' she said.
   Sweeney, an advocate for the elderly poor and disabled, said the
158-page draft proposal was described as part of Social Security's
``highest priority regulatory agency for 1989'' in one deputy
commissioner's memo just a month ago.
   Now, she said, ``they characterize it as a low-level,
brainstorming idea. That's completely disingenuous and probably
false.''
   Disability benefit cutoffs caused an uproar and created hardship
in the early years of the Reagan administration, which reviewed the
cases of more than 1 million disability beneficiaries and ordered
more than 40 percent off the rolls. Many of those affected had
qualified on the basis of mental problems.
   Most won reinstatement, and Congress and the administration
subsequently eased up on the reviews.

<HEAD>Catholic Churches To Take Up Special Collections For Retired Clergy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catholic churches nationwide will take up a
special collection this weekend to help support increasing numbers
of retired nuns and priests, church officials say.
   Most religious communities cannot afford the estimated $10,000
annual cost of caring for an elderly member of a religious order
because the number of young clergy men and women who provide
financial support is dwindling, they said.
   The Lilly Endowment Inc., based in Indianapolis, is assisting the
project.
   Without the special collections, some religious orders may have
to break up and sell their property, said Sister Mary Luke Jones,
development director for Our Lady of Grace Monastery in Beech Grove.
   Sister Mary Margaret Funk, the monastery's prioress, said the
100-member community ended the last fiscal year with a deficit
typical of those reported nationwide _ about $250,000.
   Financial problems in religious communities didn't develop
overnight. Men and women worked for years with low salaries and no
money set aside by the church for their retirements.
   Sister Jane Bodine of the Sisters of Providence said many nuns
received only $1,000 a year until the 1970s. And Sister Mary
Margaret noted that the Benedictines did not start making Social
Security payments for members until 1972. Social Security pays a
retired nun about $2,500 a year, she said.
   The Sisters of Providence, based at St. Mary-of-the-Woods near
Terre Haute, has 850 members. More than one-third of them are older
than 70.
   The retirement collections will be conducted each December for 10
years. Donations will be sent to the Tri-Conference Retirement Fund
for Men and Women Religious in Washington, D.C.
   That office, through a Lilly Endowment grant, will provide
management and financial planning assistance for religious
communities with unfunded retirement fund liabilities.
   The Tri-Conference Retirement Fund was set up in 1987 by the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Leadership Conference
of Women Religious and the Conference of Major Superiors of Men
after the depth of the crisis was discovered. A study indicated
there would be a $3 billion shortfall even if all assets of
religious communities were used for retirement needs.

<HEAD>Newspaper Probe Reveals Widespread Poisonous Levels Of Selenium</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 4 grafs after 7th graf, `The findings...' to include
comment from FDA, Interior Dept.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Selenium at levels high enough to
poison millions of high-risk Americans has been found in food from
supermarkets across the country, according to a newspaper's
seven-month investigation.
   Toxic concentrations of selenium also taint the home-grown food
and drinking water of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of farm and ranch
families in several Western states, The Sacramento Bee reported
Sunday.
   Selenium is a naturally occurring gray, non-metallic chemical
element of the sulphur group. Its levels in commercial foods are
high enough to expose even healthy adults to levels above federal
guidlines, the newspaper said.
   The potential effects for healthy adults may be nothing worse
than slight declines in overall health or resistance to disease and
infection.
   But for those living in the rural West and high-risk groups
across the nation _ the very young, old and the chronically ill _
the effects can be much more serious, including severe digestive
problems, kidney or liver damage, paralysis, even death, the
newspaper said.
   The Bee said its first set of tests established a clear danger to
rural families in Oregon, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming,
Colorado and Nevada. The second set turned up elevated selenium in
supermarket foods in seven American cities: Sacramento; Chicago;
Washington, D.C.; Atlanta; Great Falls, Mont.; Rapid City, S.D.; and
Montrose, Colo.
   The findings were based on laboratory analyses of more than 200
water, meat, fish, egg, cereal grain and dairy product samples and
on interviews with dozens of selenium victims, their doctors, public
health experts and toxicologists.
   Dr. Jean Pennington, a nutritionist for the Food and Drug
Administration, told the Bee that she doubts people are getting
unsafe levels of selenium if they eat an average diet. Pennington
questioned the diet chosen by the Bee as typical for its study but
said, ``there is the chance that more than adequate amounts will be
consumed by some people and too much could be unhealthy.''
   The highest average selenium levels in the Bee's survey came from
a Sacramento supermarket. Twelve foods were chosen at random,
including beefsteak and beef liver, chicken breast and liver, pork
chop and sausage, tuna fish, sardines, cornmeal, wheat cereal, whole
wheat bread and eggs.
   FDA studies averaged samples over an entire year, leading to
significantly lower exposure numbers, according to the Bee.
   Jonathan Deason, director of the Interior Department's study of
tainted agricultural drainage from federal water projects in the
West, said ``there really isn't any major public health problems
that we have identified.''
   Selenium has killed or deformed thousands of fish, waterfowl and
other wildlife at Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in California's
central agricultural valley. Similar effects have been confirmed by
federal studies in other parts of California and in Nevada, Utah and
Wyoming.
   Although the U.S. Interior Department is studying the selenium
threat to wildlife, no agency is studying its toxic effect on
people, the Bee said.
   Selenium enters the human food chain from thousands of square
miles of selenium-tainted soil in the West; by being added to
livestock and poultry feed; and through the vigorous marketing by
nutrition companies of selenium as a dietary supplement.
   ``People could get no more than a good bellyache from a single
high exposure, or get very, very sick from prolonged intake,'' said
Dr. Arthur Kilness, a researcher on selenium and a retired South
Dakota surgeon.
   According to the newspaper's study:
   _A healthy adult would surpass the federal Food and Drug
Administration's safe selenium level _ 200 micrograms _ by eating
two six-ounce servings of the sampled foods a day. Those servings
averaged 105 micrograms.
   _A weekly menu prepared from the foods yielded seven straight
days of intake averaging 410 micrograms. The National Academy of
Science, the National Institutes of Health and others have stated
that healthy adults suffer adverse effects above 500 micrograms.
   _Five of 11 samples of baby food exceeded the safe level of 40
micrograms for infants. One four-ounce serving of oatmeal cereal had
83 micrograms. So far, no government or health agency has determined
the toxic level for infants.
   Doctors agree that sudden, high doses of selenium can cause
lethal effects. Deaths have resulted in England and the United
States from acute industrial exposure to selenium and in China from
tainted food.
   But much less is known about chronic, long-term exposure to lower
concentrations.
   ``I doubt seriously that doctors know enough to recognize the
symptoms of selenium poisoning in humans,'' said Dr. Bruce Furst,
professor emeritus at the University of San Francisco, where he has
spent 30 years studying the toxic and cancerous effects of trace
metals.
   ``It is such a recent problem, and up to now most of those who
have looked at this whole issue have spent too much time on
deficiencies of a lot of trace elements but not enough on their
toxicity.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev have nurtured a tough, yet courteous relationship
during their years of summitry while their wives' rivalry has
evolved into the soap opera of the U.S.-Soviet sessions.
   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev are scheduled to meet for the
final time in their official roles on Wednesday when Marcella Perez
de Cuellar, wife of the U.N. secretary-general, hosts a luncheon.
The two superpower leaders also will be meeting in New York.
   Press attention for Mrs. Gorbachev is certain to be fierce. The
Soviets have sent advance word that she is determined to mix with
Christmas shoppers at such bastions of capitalist consumerism as
Macy's during her stay in New York, and in the past such publicity
hasn't pleased the U.S. first lady.
   The friction between the two women is described by former Reagan
administration chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, who wrote in his
book, ``For the Record,'' of the women's first encounter in Geneva
in 1985.
   The two smiled for the cameras over their teacups, but Regan
claimed that Mrs. Reagan was ``unprepared'' to deal with ``the
stylish, handsome woman with an intense and intelligent manner.''
   Mrs. Reagan did not take kindly to the former university
professor's attempt to indoctrinate President Reagan in the fine
points of Marxist-Leninist theory, the chief of staff said.
   ``Mrs. Reagan ... chafed under the monologue. After the door had
closed behind the Gorbachevs, she said, `Who does that dame think
she is?''' Regan wrote.
   The chief of staff, whose own run-ins with Mrs. Reagan led to his
dismissal, said that ``subsequent tension between the two women
probably traces from that first encounter,'' as well as the ``the
extraordinary amount of (press) coverage that Mrs. Gorbachev
collected in her dashes about Geneva.''
   Despite their differences, the two women have tried repeatedly _
and unsuccessfully _ to reach a rapprochement.
   During the Washington summit, Mrs. Reagan extended an invitation
to Mrs. Gorbachev to have tea and tour the White House. But the
Soviet first lady's response was long in coming, and then she asked
if the session could be rescheduled so that she might attend a
meeting between her husband and U.S. publishers and editors.
   At the White House, Mrs. Gorbachev peppered Mrs. Reagan with
questions about the trappings and history of the mansion, leaving
the first lady speechless at times, and admitting, ``I'm afraid I'm
not much help.''
   When the Moscow summit came, Nancy revealed she'd learned her
lesson.
   At first, the two women made a great show of holding hands and
conversing intimately as they strolled about, touring the golden
churches of the Kremlin.
   But the facade faded when they came together during a visit to an
icon vault.
   After speaking at length about the invaluable Russian art
collection, its message about the ``Russian soul,'' and quoting the
Russian author Feodor Dostoevsky, Mrs. Gorbachev attempted to cut
reporters off when they tried to speak with Mrs. Reagan.
   ``I want to say something. I want to say something, OK?'' Mrs.
Reagan interrupted sharply, and her Soviet hostess retreated as the
first lady went on to discuss the religious implication of the
artwork.
   In an interview published Nov. 13 in the Los Angeles Times _
prior to the announcement of another encounter with the Soviet first
lady, Mrs. Reagan was asked if she found Mrs. Gorbachev to be rude.
   ``By our standards, I suppose, yes,'' Mrs. Reagan replied,
adding, ``Now, by her standards, it might not be.
   ``It's just coming from two completely different cultures and
trying to get together for the first time and maybe one not
understanding how the other works,'' the first lady said.

   ``That is exactly why I've stayed...I have to preserve whatever
peace there is so he doesn't turn into stone...''
   Now that her father is gone, she has found a need within herself
to honor the lives of other elderly Chinese who remain.
   ``If I were to actually say, `I'm here just to save your honor
because I love you.' they'd say, `No, you're crazy,' because that's
their inner secret. If you tell them that, you're making them pay
dues in a way _ their soul.
   ``So, you want to humbly stay here and say, `I like to frolic
around you, old man.'''
   Hall vows to leave again, and for good. But not yet.
   ``This is the only place right now that keeps my soul fulfilled.
I could romp out there, but I see more lost souls.''
   When she is ready to sell her historic building, Clarence Chu
will be ready to buy it. He is co-director of Asian City
Development, the Hong Kong-based corporation that owns the land on
which Locke sits. He also operates a gift shop in Locke and has
lived in town for 11 years.
   Asian City already has purchased several other buildings on Main
Street, and its ownership has stirred worry about Locke's fate.
   The company has just gotten approval to build 72 single-family
homes on 22 acres elsewhere on the 500-acre property, but Chu
insists he does not intend to change the character of the historic
village.
   ``Anyone with a knowledge of places designated as National
Historic Monuments would never have any thought that someone would
come in and destroy it. Nobody can do that,'' he says. Chu says he
would just like to see a few new shops so that Main Street doesn't
collapse from neglect.
   There were only two shops on Main Street when Chu arrived. Now
thee are 10. As for the houses on the two back streets, they are
alive with artists who have fled high rents in urban areas for the
peace, quiet and economy of Locke.
   ``The charm of the place is that it's a dump,'' concludes Rodney
Birkett, who paints surreal oils in a two-bedroom house he rents for
$185 a month.
   His neighbor, a registered nurse named Holly Pauls, has lived in
Locke for eight years, but will soon be moving. The house she rents
has been purchased by a Chinese woman from Sacramento, 30 miles to
the north, who plans to live there with her mother.
   ``It's a town in limbo,'' she says. ``It's always been in limbo.
We're all waiting for something to happen. But it's never going to
be seriously developed until all the elderly Chinese are gone.''
   Chris Spencer, an artist who describes himself as a 21st century
impressionist, has lived across the dirt road for 11 years. He says
the atmosphere of the town has changed considerably in the past two.
   He's not sure what will happen to Locke, but he is sure what
won't.
   ``These people said a long time ago that they'd rather see the
place burn than see it turn into Knotts Berry Farm,'' he says,
referring to the popular Southern California tourist attraction.
   Lee thinks the town may be able to draw new life if development
is allowed nearby. He hopes young Chinese-Americans would be willing
to commute to nearby Sacramento and Stockton while helping to keep
Locke's cultural heritage alive.
   Tommy King says he's glad to see the artists moving in.
   ``It's better than keeping the houses empty,'' he muses. Still,
he says, the town needs to generate new traffic through its
neglected downtown if it is to survive much longer.
   ``No traffic, no business,'' he says. ``If you walk down Main
Street now, you won't see 10 people.''

   A car bomb exploded Monday across from a
hospital in Moslem west Beirut, killing one pedestrian and injuring
six, destroying cars and hurling patients from their beds, police
and witnesses said.
   A second car bomb exploded near a Syrian army checkpoint in the
easten Bekaa valley, injuring three people, police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attacks.
   A police spokesman said a gray Peugeot packed with an estimated
110 pounds of TNT exploded across the street from Baydoun Hospital
in west Beirut's Sanayeh residential district.
   None of the troops manning a Syrian checkpoint about 75 yards
from the hospital was injured, said the spokesman, who cannot be
identified under standing briefing rules.
   Syrian soldiers nervously cordoned off the hospital area as
ambulances with sirens wailing rushed the victims to the American
Unversity Hospital about six blocks away.
   A nurse at the hospital said the force of the blast hurled most
of the hospital's 36 patients out of bed as shrapnel tore through
the windows.
   ``Luckily there were no surgeries under way in the operating
theater,'' said the nurse, who refused to give her name. ``The
explosion would have definitely shaken the hands of the surgeons
which could have affected the lives of the patients.''
   Three cars parked in front of the hospital, which is one block
from Lebanon's central bank and near the prime ministry, were burned
into smoldering piles of metal.
   Police said the other car bomb exploded at 1:30 a.m. in an olive
green Mercedes near a Syrian checkpoint in the village of Saadnayel,
24 miles east of Beirut in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley.
   Police estimated the car that blew up in the village also
contained 110 pounds of TNT. Injured were two Lebanese in a passing
car and a Palestinian bystander, police said.
   The two blasts brought to 20 the number of car bombings in
Lebanon this year. Police say 115 people have been killed and 279
wounded in 18 bombings since April 23.
   Many of the bombings have been aimed at Syrian targets. Among the
wounded have been 23 Syrian troops.
   No one has claimed responsibility for any of the bombings, but
the Syrians have blamed them on right-wing Lebanese Christians
fighting against Syrian-backed Moslems and leftists in Lebanon's
13-year-old civil war.
   In other developments Monday:
   _ Syria withdrew six military observers who have been monitoring
a cease-fire between Palestinian guerrillas and Shiite Moslem
militiamen east of south Lebanon's port city of Sidon for 19 months.
   Police said the move triggered fears of a new round of fighting
between Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas
and Nabih Berri's mainstream Shiite Amal militia for control of the
highlands overlooking a Palestinian refugee camp east of Sidon.
   _ Israel released and returned three Lebanese Shiite Moslem
teen-agers seized Sunday in a motorboat off the southern Lebanese
port of Tyre by an Israeli gunboat. Police here theorized the three
were mistaken for guerrillas on an infiltration mission.

   Conductor Lorin Maazel led three orchestras through
all nine Beethoven symphonies in a 12-hour, 45-minute marathon on
Sunday to raise money for deaf children.
   Maazel, 58, wearing formal tails and a pair of comfortable shoes,
lifted his baton to begin the Beethoven odyssey at 10 a.m. He
conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philharmonia and the
London Symphony Orchestra at London's Festival Hall, taking only
brief intermissions to change musicians and symphonies.
   Organizers said they hoped to raise more than $37,000 for the
Beethoven Fund for Deaf Children, which provides musical speech
therapy to hundreds of schools in Britain.
   Beethoven wrote most of his symphonies and many other
masterpieces after he began to lose hearing, completing his final
symphony when he was deaf.

   Country singer T. Graham Brown received a
present he didn't expect from his wife during a recent anniversary
celebration.
   ``We had a really good surprise,'' Brown told reporters Sunday as
he watched a Christmas Parade. ``Our eighth wedding anniversary was
Thursday and Sheila told me she was pregnant. This will be our first
child.''
   When asked what he wanted for Christmas, besides a healthy baby,
Brown said he wished for a solution to homelessness.

   Pisar, a lawyer from Paris, accepted the award Sunday from the
Israel Bond Organization ``in the name of the children of the
Holocaust,'' and in honor of those who survived.
   Born in Bialystok, Poland, Pisar was sent to Auschwitz at the age
of 13 and later to Dachau, from which he escaped when he was 16.
More than 30 of his relatives died at the hands of the Nazis.

   Dustin Hoffman will appear on the London stage in
May playing Shylock in William Shakespeare's ``The Merchant of
Venice,'' publicists said Monday.
   Hoffman will open in late May for a 12-week run at a
yet-to-be-announced theater. It will be the actor's first stage work
since his much-acclaimed 1984 Broadway run as Willy Loman in ``Death
of a Salesman.''
   Sir Peter Hall, former director of London's National Theater,
will direct the play.
   Hoffman will be paid a reported $3,700 a week, well below the $5
million fee he routinely commands for film roles. The production
will tour England for a month prior to its London debut.

<HEAD>Soviets Seek to Set Pace for Arms Control Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after concluding an arms treaty with the
United States, Mikhail S. Gorbachev is heading for a meeting with
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush to help set the
pace for future arms talks.
   During the Soviet president's trip, which begins Tuesday, he will
address the United Nations and visit Cuba and Britain, trying to
polish his image as a statesman and dispel the image of the Soviet
Union as an enemy.
   It was Gorbachev's luncheon meeting in New York with Reagan and
Bush, planned for Wednesday, that the official media emphasized in
its reports Monday.
   Tass called the meeting is ``an extraordinary event'' because
superpower relations are a determining factor for ``the very essence
of the world process.''
   ``It is perfectly natural that the new administration will need
some time to get its bearings in the complexity of domestic and
international problems. But it is very important not to drag out
this period,'' Tass said.
   ``Marking time in international affairs, especially in the domain
of arms limitation and reduction, is tantamount not only to loss of
time, but to backsliding,'' it said.
   On Dec. 8, 1987, Gorbachev and Reagan signed an agreement to
eliminate their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   But progress in talks to cut the two sides' arsenals of strategic
weapons slowed to a crawl because of the U.S. election campaign and
problems including continued differences over Reagan's ``Star Wars''
program for a space-based defense against nuclear attack.
   The government newspaper Izvestia, in a front-page article from
New York on Monday, said the U.S. administration was preparing
intensively for the meeting with Gorbachev. ``There is a basis to
suppose that the administration will not only listen, but propose
something in return,'' the paper said.
   Gorbachev has said he is seeking improved relations with the West
in order to free up resources to improve the standard of living of
Soviet citizens.
   One Western analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
Soviet Union ``doesn't have the resources to sustain the investment
it's been making in foreign aid and defense.''
   Despite Gorbachev's drive for ``perestroika,'' or restructuring,
Soviet citizens have seen no improvement in the quality or quantity
of food and consumer goods, and there is a pervasive feeling that
things actually have worsened.
   A survey by a Moscow sociological research institute earlier this
fall found that only 2 percent of workers interviewed thought their
lives had improved significantly under Gorbachev.
   Soviet sources said the presssure to devote more resources to
domestic needs means Gorbachev will try to end to the ``enemy
image.'' He also will try to convince Fidel Castro in Cuba that it
is time to de-emphasize the revolutionary movement in Latin America.
   Izvestia, in an apparent effort to make the point about the new
image Gorbachev is trying to project, pointedly reminded readers
Monday of an episode in which former leader Nikita S. Khrushchev
pounded his shoe on a table at the United Nations in 1960.
   Without naming Khrushchev, the paper said many still recall ``how
our leader looked then in the hall of the General Assembly, how he
jumped up from his place, trying to interrupt speakers he didn't
like, pounded his fist on the table (and not only his fist).''
   In his talks with Castro, Gorbachev will emphasize that the
Soviet Union will no longer encourage communist revolutions in Latin
America, said one Soviet expert on Latin America.
   ``We are now saying human values take precedence over class
values,'' said the expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We
are no longer supporting class wars or socialist revolutions in
Latin America. We are not against class struggle, but we are saying
it should not dominate international relations. We are not going to
get involved.''

   Iran's deputy foreign minister said Monday
his government will assist efforts to free foreign hostages held in
Lebanon even if four Iranians seized by Lebanese Christians in 1982
prove to be dead.
   Senior officials in Tehran have said they would use their
influence with pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers if Western
governments helped locate and free the Iranians.
   The Federation of Arab News Agencies appealed earlier Monday for
the release of Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press. He has been held longest of the 15 foreigners
missing and known to have been kidnapped.
   Anderson, one of nine Americans in captivity, was abducted March
16, 1985.
   Mohammad Ali Besharati, the Iranian official, told a news
conference at his country's embassy in Moslem west Beirut:
   ``It will be most regrettable for us to hear that the four
missing Iranians, who all had diplomatic status, are dead, but this
will not prevent us from persisting in our humanitarian efforts to
free the Western hostages in line with our Islamic principles. We
refuse to allow any threat against the lives of innocents.''
   Besharati's comment was the first public acknowledgment by Iran
that the men may be dead.
   Among Iranian leaders offering help with the hostages was Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the parliament speaker and military commander, who
addressed this statement to Washington last month:
   ``If you are interested in having your people held hostage in
Lebanon released, then tell the (Christian) Phalangists to release
our people who have been in their hands for years.''
   The missing Iranians are Ahmad Motevaselian, commander of Iranian
Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon;
Charge d'Affaires Hussein Musavi; Kazem Akhavan, a correspondent of
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, and Rastegar Moqadam,
a Lebanese Shiite driver with an Iranian passport.
   They were seized at a checkpoint 25 miles north of Beirut in July
1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The checkpoint at the
northern tip of the Christian enclave was controlled by the Lebanese
Forces, the main Christian militia.
   ``We shall continue to make efforts to free the hostages,''
Besharati said, adding: ``some of the captors do sympathize with us
and we don't know about the others. Perhaps our efforts will
influence both groups.''
   At its annual conference, the Federation of Arab News Agencies
``discussed the question of Terry Anderson's continued abduction and
resolved that this is hampering the publication of Arab news abroad
and curbing the freedom of the press in general,'' secretary-general
Farid Ayyar said in a statement.
   ``We appeal to Terry Anderson's holders to reconsider their
position because the AP bureau chief was conducting a professional
mission without any involvement in the existing conflicts,'' he said.
   Ayyar issued the statement after returning from federation's 17th
annual meeting in Damascus, capital of Syria. Seventeen Arab news
agencies belong to the group.
   Besharati arrived in Beirut on Sunday, after two days of talks
with Syrian officials in Damascus, and met with Lebanese leaders in
Beirut before the news conference.
   He said the main purpose of his trip was to reconcile Lebanon's
two warring Shiite militias _ the pro-Syrian Amal and the Hezbollah,
or Party of God, which is loyal to Iran and believed to be an
umbrella group for the kidnappers.
   The two factions are vying for dominance among Lebanon's 1
million Shiites and fought a six-day street battle in west and south
Beirut that was stopped a week ago by Syrian troops.
   Syria has about 25,000 soldiers stationed in northern and eastern
Lebanon and about 7,500 in the Moslem sectors of Beirut.
   Besharati, appears to be the Iranian official in charge of
relations with Lebanese Shiites. He was involved in an agreement
that ended a round of Amal-Hezbollah fighting in May.

<HEAD>Former UAW Local Official Still Fighting For Pensions Lost 25 Years
Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former United Auto Workers official is
still fighting to win pension benefits for workers who lost their
jobs when the Studebaker Corp. shut down 25 years ago.
   ``As long as I have breath in my body, I will continue,'' says
Odell ``Duke'' Newburn, former president of UAW Local 5.
   Almost 6,000 workers lost their pensions when Studebaker locked
the gates to its South Bend factory Dec. 20, 1963. Many had at least
10 years of service but lost out because the company's pension plan
was not fully funded.
   In 1975, a federal law was enacted requiring companies to
purchase federal insurance to protect pensions, but that didn't help
the Studebaker workers.
   ``We were the cause of pensions being secured, but no laws were
made retroactive back to them,'' said Newburn. ``They forgot those
who made that law possible.''
   A bill to help those workers and others who have lost pensions
has been introduced annually in Congress since 1979 but has made
little progress, Newburn said.
   Newburn continues to speak in support of the measure and fields
questions about it almost daily from former Studebaker workers. ``I
tell them the issue isn't dead and that someone is still working on
it,'' he said.
   Karen Friedman, education director of the Pension Rights Center,
a Washington lobbying group, said the measure would have helped
about 83,000 people and cost $40 a million a year had it been
enacted in 1979. The cost would diminish annually as deaths reduce
the number of recipients, she said.

   Guerrillas attacked a passenger bus in
the northern Afghan province of Kunduz, killing 42 people,
Afghanistan's official radio said Monday.
   Only an 8-year-old child survived the Thursday attack, the radio
said.
   Another eight people were reported killed when hundreds of
rockets blasted two Afghan cities, Radio Kabul said.
   There was no independent confirmation of the reports.
   The radio broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said a bus was
attacked by ``criminals who are supported by Pakistan and the United
States,'' presumably referring to Moslem guerrillas fighting
Afghanistan's Soviet-backed Marxist government.
   The sole survivor was an 8-year-old child, said Radio Kabul.
   More than 300 surface-to-surface rockets blasted the eastern
Afghan city of Gardez during the past two days killing six people
and injuring scores more, said Radio Kabul.
   Two people died and four were injured in rocket attacks on the
northern city of Kunduz, the radio said.
   The radio also said Afghanistan has lodged 139 complaints with a
U.N. team monitoring an accord providing for the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   Under the accord, signed in Geneva in April, the Soviet Union
agreed to withdraw its 100,000 combat troops from Afghanistan
between last May 15 and next Feb. 15.
   About half already have left, but the pullout is stalled
temporarily because the communists claim Pakistan is violating the
pact by continuing to arm the guerrillas.
   Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan in 1979.
   In Saudi Arabia, representatives of the seven-party Afghan
guerrilla alliance Monday concluded talks with Soviet deputy foreign
minister Yuri Vorontsov in the resort town of Taif.
   Radio Kabul said Afghanistan's president Najib welcomed the
talks, which he claimed were initiated by Saudi Arabia.
   A guerrilla spokesman, Burhanuddin Rabbani, said the Soviets
instigated the talks. The insurgents said the talks were tacit
recognition by Moscow of the Washington-backed guerrillas.

   Raleigh's state of emergency was rescinded
Monday and police were pulled off guard duty at tornado-ravaged
neighborhoods, a week after killer twisters swept through the area.
   ``We are back to normal at this time,'' said police Capt. R.D.
Williams. ``There will not be any extra police or patrols in the
areas.''
   ``I don't think it would change the cleanup efforts,'' said
Marvin Heller of the city's Emergency Communications Center. ``What
it probably does is end whatever powers they (police) had as far as
trespassing and everything.''
   Police had warned they might use emergency powers to charge
sightseers who got underfoot.
   Williams said he didn't know of anyone being charged under the
emergency powers but couldn't say whether the danger of looting was
over from the tornadoes last week that killed four people and caused
millions of dollars in damage in Raleigh and nearby areas.
   Bumper-to-bumper traffic posed problems over the weekend, as
motorists drove by the rubble with cameras. In Franklin County,
passers-by were asked for donations _ one of dozens of ways people
raised money for disaster relief.
   The American Red Cross relief fund reached about $550,000 by
Sunday afternoon, said Kristine Dewar, a Red Cross spokeswoman.
   State and federal officials met Monday in Raleigh to coordinate
the opening of disaster application centers, which will provide
temporary housing assistance, low-interest loans and grants
agricultural aid to people with uninsured losses.

   A second indictment of 11 counts charged former PTL Vice
President David Taggart and his brother, James, with tax evasion and
conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue Service in the collection
of taxes.
   The Taggarts were accused of diverting some $1.1 million in PTL
funds to pay personal bills and expenses while failing to report the
funds as income on their 1983 through 1987 tax returns.
   For those years, according to the indictment, David Taggart
evaded some $320,000 in taxes while James Taggart evaded taxes
amounting to some $175,000. David Taggart was a special assistant to
Bakker as PTL vice president, and James Taggart is a former interior
designer for PTL.

   Jack and Alice James believe in the magic
of Christmas.
   The thousands of letters to Santa Claus that come into this
little central Florida community each year are personally answered
by the couple with postcards that bear the simple message: ``Lots of
love, Santa.''
   For the past two decades, the Jameses have mailed out the
handwritten postcards on a scale that even Santa Claus would admire.
They expect to send out around 2,000 this season, at a cost of $300
for postage alone.
   ``We love Christmas, and we have a great time reading the
letters,'' said Alice James, 61.
   Because the U.S. Postal Service lets each post office make its
own arrangements for Santa mail, many of the letters are simply
routed to this community between Orlando and the Kennedy Space
Center that thrives on its name.
   The couple say there is nothing like getting a thank-you note for
Santa, or hearing about a child who treasures his Santa postcard
like a 2-year-old did last year.
   ``His mother said that from the moment he got it, he slept with
it. He held onto it all day. By the time Christmas got there, his
Santa postcard was a mess,'' said Mrs. James, laughing.
   ``That's what makes it all worthwhile.''

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat is to meet a
group of prominent American Jews on Tuesday, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman announced.
   Members of the group asked that their names remain secret until
after the talks with the leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, said the spokesman, Martin Hallqvist.
   ``They represent a significant part of Jewish opinion in the
United States,'' Hallqvist said.
   The Foreign Ministry said the meeting was part of Sweden's effort
to help the peace process in the Middle East.
   A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy said the Foreign Ministry had
informed the mission of the planned meeting shortly before the
announcement was made. Hallqvist said the encounter was planned two
weeks ago when Khaled Hassan, the chairman of the PLO foreign
affairs committee, met representatives of a Jewish group in
Stockholm.
   In Paris, Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson said he was cutting
short his visit to France and canceling a meeting with President
Francois Mitterrand to be in Sweden for the Arafat visit.
   Carlsson said ``this is a meeting between two parties which have
had difficulties talking or in communication. The Swedish government
has been able to help them to meet.''
   Israeli officials refuse to meet members of the PLO, which they
say is a terrorist organization, and they have discouraged U.S. Jews
from holding such talks.
   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry statement said Israel
``expressed stupefication'' that Arafat would be received by
high-ranking Swedish officials, and warned it would be ``extremely
damaging'' if the talks went ahead. It voiced ``astonishment'' over
the likely meeting with U.S. Jews.
   Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson has condemned Secretary
of State George Shultz's decision to deny Arafat a U.S. entry visa
so he could address the U.N. General Assembly during its debate on
Palestine.
   Andersson called Shultz's move ``unwise, unreasonable and
untimely.''
   The U.N. debate was rescheduled for Dec. 13-15 in Geneva, the
first time the General Assembly will meet outside the United States
in the United Nations' 43-year history.
   Sweden has welcomed the declaration of an independent Palestinian
state by the Palestine National Council, the Palestinian
parliament-in-exile. But it has not joined about 60 other countries
that granted the PLO diplomatic recognition.
   On Saturday, Andersson said Sweden's solidarity with Israel
``will continue with undiminished strength,'' but he urged Israel
``to take the PLO's extended hand and begin peace negotiations.''

   The indictment against Bakker and Dortch alleges that in late
1983, Bakker announced construction of a vacation park at Heritage
USA that was to include a grand hotel. In 1984, he announced the
sale of lifetime memberships for the purpose of financing the
hotel's construction, the indictment said.
   Lifetime partners were to receive free lodging at the Fort Mill,
S.C., complex in exchange for big contributions to PTL.
   The indictment alleged that Bakker and Dortch made false
statements to induce members of the public to buy partnerships and
that the partner funds weren't used to construct the lodging
facilities promised.
   Bakker and Dortch promised that the funds would be used to build
the Grand Hotel, Tower Hotel, Country Farm Inn, Heritage Grand
Mansion, a campground and several bunkhouses, the indictment said.
But by the time Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987, only the
Grand Hotel and one bunkhouse had been completed, the indictment
said.
   According to the grand jury's report, more than 152,000 fully
paid partnerships were sold producing at least $158 million in
revenue for the evangelical empire built by Bakker and his wife,
Tammy, before his downfall in a sex and money scandal in March 1987.
   The indictment alleged that Bakker and Dortch diverted PTL funds
for their own use. Bakker and his wife were given bonuses totaling
nearly $3.5 million and Dortch obtained bonuses totaling $550,000,
the indictment said.
   At the same time, Bakker and Dortch were concealing the true
financial condition of PTL from the ministry's board of directors,
the indictments said.
   The defendants were ordered to appear Dec. 15 in federal court.
   The maximum penalty for each count of mail fraud, wire fraud,
conspiracy and tax evasion is a fine of up to $250,000 and five
years in prison.
   Prosecutors in the case declined comment. U.S. Attorney Thomas
Ashcraft said, ``There has already been too much publicity on this
already and we don't want any more.''
   Last month, Bakker, Dortch and Roe Messner, PTL's former chief
builder, received letters from prosecutors informing them that they
were targets of the investigation and inviting them to testify.
   Only Messner, a Wichita, Kan., contractor, accepted.
   Bakker resigned from PTL in a scandal over the payment of hush
money to Jessica Hahn, with whom he had a sexual encounter in a
hotel room in 1980. He was later dismissed as a minister by the
Assemblies of God amid allegations that included homosexual
encounters.
   Former TV preacher John Wesley Fletcher, who appeared on ``The
PTL Club'' from the mid-1970s to 1981 and admitted introducing
Bakker and Hahn, said in an interview for Penthouse magazine that he
had sex with Bakker three times. He is the second man to say
publicly that he had sex with Bakker.
   Bakker denied the earlier allegations by former PTL official Jay
Babcock.
   Three months after Bakker left PTL, the ministry filed for
bankruptcy reorganization under Chapter 11.
   Bakker has denied any criminal wrongdoing. He has called the
grand jury investigation ``a fishing expedition.''
   
   Three months ago he predicted: ``I don't think I'll be indicted.
I never have. If I am, I'll be shocked.''
   As members of the grand jury left the federal building today, one
juror was asked if he was relieved the investigation was over.
``It's all part of life,'' said the man, who didn't give his name.

   President Reagan's chief spokesman on Monday
denied a claim that a secret U.S.-Israeli agreement existed that
t counterterrorist operations by the two governments.
   ``There is no document or umbrella agreement that authorizes
those kinds of things,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said when asked
about statements attributed to Amiram Nir, a former Israeli officiauthorized
coveral
who died in a plane crash in Mexico last week.
   Nir, who had been linked to the Iran-Contra affair, said in June
that a compact allowed such covert operations, which he said he
supervised with then-National Security Council aide Oliver L. North,
The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions.
   North has been charged with a variety of offenses related to the
clandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran in 1985-86 and the subsequent
diversion of proceeds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. He is
scheduled to go on trial in late January.
   Nir told the Post last summer that the agreement authorized
still-secret operations that he and North supervised in 1985-86, the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega canceled a
trip to the United Nations on Monday, saying the United States had
placed unacceptable restrictions on his travel and on the size of
his party.
   ``The United States has violated international norms and its
promises to the United Nations and has broken the principles of the
United Nations,'' Ortega told a news conference.
   Ortega, in Mexico for the inauguration of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, said he had been planning to fly to New York to
discuss the latest Central American peace initiative and to plead
for aid for his hurricane battered country.
   U.S. officials noted that the United States had issued expedited
visas for Ortega, his wife, his son, and 15 other Nicaraguans. The
United States turned down the visas of 14 other people because they
were not submitted 15 days before the trip.
   ``Now we guaranteed his right to come to the United Nations, but
we did not guarantee his right to bring unlimited numbers of people
with him, nor did we guarantee his right to tourism in the United
States,'' said Vernon Walters, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
   Ortega said the United States limited his travels to four
boroughs of New York City, which he said would prevent him from
visiting the home of the Nicaraguan ambassador to the United
Nations, who lives outside that area.
   He said the United States had no right to decide ``when, how and
with whom a chief of state can visit an international organization
like the United Nations.''
   In New York, Walters said that ``a lot of people take less than
30 people from a lot larger countries than Nicaragua.''
   ``Secondly, Mr. Ortega came up the last time to the United
Nations, and he was jogging in the park, buying glasses and speaking
in Denver, Colorado, and other places.''
   Ortega said he had hoped to describe the extensive damage done in
Nicaragua by Hurricane Joan in October and plead for international
help.
   He said he also wanted to confer with U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar about a new proposal for the United Nations
to participate in verifying a Central American peace accord.
   U.S. officials said Ortega had planned to meet with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who will address the U.N. General
Assembly and will meet with President Reagan and President-elect
George Bush.
   Ortega said that U.S. policy in Central America had been a
failure during the Reagan administration.
   ``Reagan came into office intending to finish Nicaragua and the
revolution in El Salvador,'' said Ortega. ``In January (when Reagan
leaves office), we'll still be there and he'll be leaving behind an
explosive situation in El Salvador, where the guerrillas are
stronger than they ever were.''
   Ortega said he saw no prospect of renewed negotiations with
Contra guerrillas because the guerrillas are not interested.
   He also rejected criticisms by Mexican leftists who had said
Ortega and Cuban President Fidel Castro were supporting an
illegitimate government by attending Salinas' inauguration.
   ``If they play the electoral game,'' he said, ``they shouldn't
cry about the results.''

   Beijing is officially turning to the right despite
the government's leftist ideology.
   Municipal traffic officials already have banned left turns at 150
intersections in an effort to reduce snarls, and plan to outlaw all
left turns everywhere in the capital by the end of 1989, the
official China Daily said Monday.
   To ensure there will be no turning back from the rightist course,
the city will be designating almost all streets one-way only, the
paper said.
   Although hardly any Chinese have their own cars, growing numbers
of offices and enterprises are buying vehicles. Roads once used
mainly by bicyclists are jammed daily by cars, trucks, jeeps and
three-wheeled vehicles of all kinds that creep at an average pace of
about 12 mph.
   The China Daily quoted traffic officials as saying the
right-turn-only policy already has reduced jams at intersections
where it is enforced.
   An informal poll of taxi drivers, however, say rigid rightism
applied to traffic makes no more sense than extreme leftism did in
the 1960s, when revolutionary-minded officials decided to make red
stand for go and green for stop in traffic lights.
   Traffic officials have not created alternate means for drivers to
get to their leftward destinations, such as overpasses. Instead,
most drivers turn right and then try to turn around in the side
road, creating little jams of cars making U-turns.

   Gunmen opened fire on the patrons of a
bar in a northwestern town and killed six people, police said Monday.
   The attack Sunday in the town of Puerto Valdivia, 195 miles
northwest of Bogota, appeared to be the work of a right-wing death
squad, they said.
   The victims included a member of a Marxist group, the Patriotic
Union, and a guerrilla of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces,
police said.
   Death squads have killed more than 900 people in Colombia in the
past four years.
   This year, the squads have killed 282 people in 21 massacres.
Most of the victims were members of the Patriotic Union.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   The government said Monday it
will make 32,000 acres available to blacks outside the township of
Soweto.
   The land is to be developed by the government and private
builders for housing, agriculture and light industry, said Rolef
Meyer, the deputy minister of constitutional planning.
   Soweto, with a population of 2.5 million, is the main black
township outside Johannesburg.
   ``The need is tremendous at this stage in terms of (black)
housing,'' Meyer said. ``We can provide for the black community in a
better way than we've done so far.''
   An average of 15 to 20 people live in each of Soweto's 130,000
housing units, according to most estimates. Most of the homes have
only four rooms.
   There is a severe housing shortage in black areas and an
estimated 7 million of the country's 26 million blacks are
squatters, although a housing surplus exists in white areas.
   Under the country's apartheid policies, all neighborhoods are
segregated by race and blacks have no voice in national affairs
controlled by the 5 million whites.
   The extreme-right Conservative Party condemned the government's
decision, saying it would attract more blacks to urban areas.
   ``This will be another example of the government's policy of
unorderly urbanization,'' said Olaus van Zyl, a Conservative member
of Parliament.

<HEAD>Scientology President Remains In Jail Pending Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Church of Scientology
International remains in prison without bail pending pending further
investigation of charges of fraud, criminal association and tax
evasion, a court clerk said Monday.
   Judge Jose Maria Vazquez Honrubia does not plan to set bail for
Heber Jentzsch of Los Angeles, whom he ordered jailed Nov. 23, the
clerk said.
   ``The judge has no intention of freeing him on bail,'' said the
clerk, who spoke on condition of anonymity. She said Vazquez
Honrubia had at least three months before he was legally required to
file formal charges against Jentzsch.
   Jentzsch, 53, has been held at the Carabanchel Prison outside
Madrid together with 10 others who were arrested in a raid Nov. 20.
After questioning all 71 people arrested in the raid, Vazquez
Honrubia expelled 10 foreigners and released 50 others.
   The clerk said Vazquez Honrubia was still preparing charges based
on his nine-month investigation into the activities of the Church of
Scientology and Narconon, a church-linked drug rehabilitation
program that the judge said swindled its clients and lured them into
Scientology.
   Scientology officials in Madrid said Jentzsch had nothing to do
with church finances and could not have committed crimes in Spain
since he had never been in the country before November.
   ``The absolute truth, above good or bad, is that Heber works a
job similar to that of ambassador,'' said Andrea Hoden, a Los
Angeles-based church official. ``He does not handle financial or
administrative matters.''
   The Church of Scientology, founded in the 1950s by science
fiction author and former U.S. Navy officer L. Ron Hubbard, is based
on writings published in Hubbard's 1949 book, ``Dianetics: The
Modern Science of Mental Health.''
   Followers strive toward a ``clear state'' by using a lie
detector-type device called an ``E-Meter,'' coupled with exercise
and counseling.
   Hubbard held the position of founder and executive director of
the church, and Jentzsch is president, Ms. Hoden said.
   She said Church of Scientology officials had offered through
Jentzsch's Spanish lawyers to sort out responsibility for possible
wrongdoings, but Vazquez Honrubia had refused to release details of
the alleged charges and denied church lawyers access to documents
seized in the raid.
   ``What we thought was a tragic mistake has now turned into a
human rights violation,'' Ms. Hoden said.
   Vazquez Honrubia said authorities had frozen $1.76 million in
bank accounts belonging to officials of the church and Narconon
because the money had not been declared to tax authorities.
   He said his Madrid District Court 21 had been ``flooded'' with
calls from Spaniards who said they had been swindled by Narconon. He
said he planned to hand over the case to a court with national
jurisdiction once he had completed compiling the results of his
investigation.
   The Justice Ministry has twice denied the Church of Scientology
status as a religious entity.
   Ms. Hoden appeared at a press conference Monday with American
opera singer Julia Migenes, who denounced Jentzsch's imprisonment as
``a great error.''
   Migenes described herself as a Scientologist and a close friend
of Jentzsch, who she said was ``a man of great dreams, great
qualities and honesty.''
   Migenes said she had filed a formal complaint with the U.N. Human
Rights Commission, asking the Geneva-based body to investigate the
arrest and imprisonment of Jentzsch.
   Another Scientologist and friend of Jentzsch, jazz pianist Chick
Corea, appeared in Madrid Nov. 26 to defend the jailed leader.

<HEAD>President-Elect Says Venezuela Should `Normalize' Ties With Cuba</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Carlos Andres Perez
said Monday that his country should strengthen diplomatic ties with
Cuba and include it in efforts to promote Latin American integration.
   ``Even with our unsolvable ideological differences, because of
(Cuba's) position in the communist world, we should normalize
relations with Cuba,'' Perez said at his first news conference since
declaring victory in Sunday's election.
   Cuba and Venezuela withdrew ambassadors in 1980 in a dispute over
a dissident Cuban tried in Venezuela for sabotage.
   Perez has not yet been officially elected, but all exit polls
showed him winning decisively over his nearest rival, Eduardo
Fernandez, who conceded defeat. Partial returns show him with 52
percent of the vote.
   Perez, 66, succeeds Jaime Lusinchi, also of the left-of-center
Democratic Action Party, as Venezuela's leader for the next five
years.
   Perez, who takes office in February, has set as his first task
renegotiating the nation's $33 billion debt with foreign banks. The
debt is the fourth-largest in Latin America after Brazil, Mexico and
Argentina.
   Perez believes he is the man to lead a Latin American drive to
set new terms on the regional debt crisis, and he promised to meet
other regional leaders to work out negotiations.
   ``We do not want to enter into confrontations with creditor
nations (but) it is indispensable to open a dialogue in which our
terms are heard,'' he said.
   Referring to a trade promoting pact signed recently between
Argentina and Brazil, he said ``Venezuela and Mexico should initiate
this process. This is our challenge.''
   Perez said he ``cannot conceive'' of any regional pact to control
drug trafficking that would exclude Cuba.
   ``It is better for all of us if Cuba subjects itself to
international obligations. Isolationist measures are out of place
now,'' he said.
   He said he intends to continue efforts to move Panama toward
democracy. Perez was part of a negotiating process seeking the exit
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama, and claims the process
failed when the United States imposed economic sanctions.
   ``I will continue to cooperate for a definitive solution in
Panama so that elections there next year can be a serious road to
democratization,'' he said.
   He said he will be going to Kuwait and other Persian Gulf states
to promote a meeting of OPEC heads of state.
   Venezuela depends on oil for 90 percent of its export earnings
and has seen those earnings slump dramatically in the last few years
with the fall in oil prices.
   Although Perez has not been officially declared the winner of
Sunday's vote, the Supreme Electoral Council's third bulletin gave
Perez 52 percent out of 439,445 votes, or 5 percent of the
electorate, that had been counted by midday.
   His nearest challenger, Fernandez, had 38.5 percent of the votes
counted, the council said.

   The Kremlin on Monday threatened to fire and
prosecute any Communist Party official or economic manager who
dismissed workers for ethnic reasons in the tense republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   The toughly worded directive from the Council of Ministers and
the Communist Party Central Committee was another step in the
Kremlin's effort to impose order on the republics, where a flare up
of ethnic tension in the last three weeks has left at least 28
people dead.
   Economic managers, party officials and government leaders who
permit workers to be fired for ethnic reasons will be ``brought to
personal responsibility all the way to exclusion from the party,
removal from their post, and in instances forseen by the law,
brought to criminal responsibility,'' the directive said.
   Official media reports have placed the number of refugees fleeing
the threat of violence in Azerbaijan and Armenia at more than
180,000, They are housed in relatives' homes, empty apartments and
recreational camps.
   Tass said the Central Council of Soviet Trade Unions and the
Komsomol, or Young Communist League, were providing space for 24,000
children at sanatoriums and tourist facilities.
   A fund to help the children had been formed by the Soviet
Children's Fund and the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent, the
official news agency said. The Education Ministry was ordered to
send teachers to the temporary quarters, it said.
   The Kremlin directive, also distributed by Tass, said the
government and party had received thousands of complaints from
workers in Azerbaijan and Armenia about firings for ethnic reasons.
   It said there was evidence that economic managers and party
leaders not only had not stopped such firings, but in some cases had
participated.
   The republics are deadlocked in a dispute over control of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. Ethnic Armenians, who are the
majority in the region, are demanding it be annexed by Armenia.
   Azerbaijan and the Soviet government both have rejected
annexation. Rioting in February led to the deaths of at least 32
people in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.
   Azerbaijani newspapers have protested that ethnic Armenian
officials in Nagorno-Karabakh have thrown many ethnic Azerbaijanis
out of work, and have deprived Azerbaijani families of food and
medical supplies.
   Similar charges have been made in both republics.
   Moscow radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London, said Monday that 106,000 Armenians had left their homes in
Azerbaijan. Last week, official Azerbaijani sources had put the
number of refugees from Armenia at 75,000.
   Other reports Monday said security forces broke up a meeting in
Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, but tensions had eased in the
Armenian capital of Yerevan, and a curfew there was eased.
   Much of the two republics, located in the Caucasus Mountains
region, have been under curfew and military law.
   Radio Moscow reported Baku ``still remains tense. At a number of
enterprises people have failed to come out to work. No transport is
operating in the center of the city.''
   The broadcast said security forces dispersed about 1,500 people
in the Baku's Lenin Square Sunday night. The forces moved in after
the crowd failed to respond to appeals by the chairman of the city
council and a commandant to disperse.
   Demonstrations and meetings are banned under military law imposed
two weeks ago.
   ``Irresponsible elements among those who gathered tried to put up
resistance. The servicemen fulfilled the tasks that had been put to
them. No weapons were used,'' the broadcast said.
   Some members of the crowd were detained, Radio Moscow reported.
The broadcast did not say why the crowd had gathered or whether they
were demonstrating over the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
   Lenin Square was closed for ``sanitary work'' following the
dispersal of the meeting, according to Baku radio.
   In Yerevan, a 10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew imposed Nov. 24 was cut to 11
p.m.-5 a.m., the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda reported.
More than 2,400 people were detained and 32 were arrested since it
was imposed, Pravda said.

   Switzerland will pay the bill for the
security surrounding the U.N. General Assembly, which is to meet in
Geneva next week for a special session to be addressed by PLO chief
Yasser Arafat.
   Foreign Minister Rene Felber said Swiss army units will be used
to reinforce police and border guards for the Dec. 13-15 session.
   The New York-based General Assembly has voted to meet in Geneva
because the United States refused Arafat an entry visa to
participate in the session on Palestinian issues.
   It will be the first time in the United Nations' 43-year-old
history that the General Assembly meets outside the United States.
   Felber said the number of reinforcements will be decided this
week. He said officials would draw from experience gathered during a
1983 U.N. Conference on Palestine.
   During that session, 2,000 soldiers and 600 police patrolled the
city, with tanks and barbed-wire barricades surrounding the
sprawling complex of the Palais des Nations, the Geneva offices of
the United Nations.
   About 300 delegates were expected for the special session.
   For security reasons, the exact date of Arafat's arrival and the
time of his speech were kept secret.

   The ``Door of Paradise,'' a 15th century
portal that graces the St. John baptistry, will be removed for
restoration and replaced by a replica, officials said Monday.
   The 16-foot-by-8-foot bronze door, damaged by time and pollution,
is to be removed at the beginning of 1989 and replaced by a replica
in 1990. Until then, wood will fill the opening in the octagonal St.
John baptistry.
   The original door, expected to be restored by 1995, is to be kept
in the museum of the nearby Duomo cathedral to protect it from
further damage.
   The door's 10 panels, which depict scenes from the Bible, were
sculpted by Lorenzo Ghiberti between 1425 and 1452.
   Michelangelo was said to have called the work the ``Door of
Paradise.''

Leadership</HEAD>

criticize Wright; PICKS UP 4th graf pvs bgng, `The reputation'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Bob Michel of Illinois pledged today
to pursue tougher ethics policies as he was re-elected House
Minority Leader. The Democrats, meanwhile, voted for the first time
to put a black into their top leadership.
   Michel delivered a shot at the Democratic leadership of the House
over the past decade.
   Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was running unopposed for a second
two-year term, and he was assured of re-election to his post by
fellow Democrats later today despite an inquiry into allegations of
unethical behavior in his personal finances and his handling of
government secrets.
   ``The reputation of this institution has been smeared by members
who blatantly break our rules and mock the institution's inability
to enforce a penalty,'' Michel told fellow GOP lawmakers, who
elected him to a fifth two-year term as their leader. He was
unopposed.
   Michel did not mention Wright by name, but made it clear that the
Republicans intend to pursue the inquiry against the speaker, which
they initiated. The House ethics committee is investigating the
charges against Wright.
   ``I believe we must more clearly define our ethics rules, and
then we have to enforce them,'' he said. ``The record of enforcement
in this House is a national disgrace.''
   The principal contested races on each side were for the largely
ceremonial tasks of presiding over party meetings.
   Rep. William H. Gray III, the chairman of the House Budget
Committee, won the post of Democratic caucus chairman over Rep. Mary
Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, who has been vice chairman of the caucus, and
Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla. The vote was 146 for Gray, 80 for Ms.
Oakar, and 33 for Synar.
   Gray becomes the first black to climb that high in the leadership
structure, according to House historians. If Ms. Oakar had won, she
would set the standard for a woman in the House.
   The hottest Republican race saw Rep. Jerry Lewis of California
edge out Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois for the chairmanship of the
House Republican Conference, the counterpart to the Democratic
caucus. Lewis won in a runoff by a vote of 85-82 after Rep. Bill
Dannemeyer, R-Calif., was third and dropped out following the first
ballot.
   If Ms. Martin had won, she would have broken new ground for a
House GOP woman.
   The Democrats saw no major changes in their leadership, as
Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Majority Whip Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., who were first elected to those posts two years
ago, are returning to face a new president together.
   ``The team is together,'' said Coelho.
   To start 1987, the Democratic leaders came forward with an
aggressive agenda to counter the Reagan administration. This time
they are holding back to give George Bush a chance to offer his own
plans.
   ``We welcome his getting on the wagon'' on issues such as child
care and the environment, ``and we intend to see what he wants to
do,'' Coelho said.
   On the Republican side, Michel, the minority leader for eight
years, served with Bush in the House. The new president will have
another ally in Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., who moved up a rung on the
GOP ladder to fill the slot of minority whip. The No. 2 slot is
being vacated by Trent Lott of Mississippi, who was elected to the
Senate.
   Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland was running unopposed for
Oakar's old job as vice chairman of the Democratic caucus.
   The current Democratic caucus chairman, Rep. Richard A. Gephardt
of Missouri, will be appointed a deputy whip, Coelho said. That
would allow the former presidential candidate to retain a say in
leadership decisions in the House. David Bonior of Michigan will
remain Coelho's chief deputy.
   In addition to electing officers, both parties will begin vying
for changes in the House rules for the new Congress that might give
them an advantage in legislative struggle.
   Democratic Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, is being opposed by
his own party leadership in his quest to force disclosure of the
beneficiaries of special-interest provisions in legislation.
   The proposal would require the listing of the name of each
beneficiary, the cost to taxpayers of the provision, and the name of
the lawmaker who sponsored it.
   Stenholm contends it would sae members of Congress embarrassment
later, but the primary spending and tax-writing panels oppose the
plan.

   Judges went on strike Monday, paralyzing
the court system, and other unions announced protests that could
disrupt trials for two weeks.
   The Union of Judicial Magistrates called the three-day strike
after the government included Portugal's 1,200 judges in a salary
restructuring plan for public employees. The union claims the move
will lead to lower pay rises.
   Other court officials have planned a one-day strike Friday while
public prosecutors have anounced they will stop work for three days
next week.
   This week's action is the first ever national strike by
Portuguese judges.
   Courts are running only a minimum service to handle cases where
the liberty of individuals is at stake.
   Trade union estimates said 90 percent of the judges had accepted
the strike call.

<HEAD>Report Blames Ice, Crew Training For Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government investigators Monday blamed ice on the
wings of an Italian airliner and the flight crew's reaction for a
crash that killed 37 people last year.
   Nine people, including French and Italian airline officials, were
indicted in October on manslaughter charges from the Oct. 15, 1987,
crash of a twin-engine turboprop ATR-42 operated by the ATI
subsidiary of Italy's state-run Alitalia.
   The plane, carrying mostly West Germans, crashed shortly after
takeoff on a flight from Milan to Cologne.
   A government report published Monday said the first event leading
to the crash was the formation of ice that altered the aerodynamic
profile of the wings.
   The ice made one wing fall in an unusual action that the crew
almost certainly attributed to a malfunction in the automatic pilot
instead of a stall, it said.
   The report contends sharp manuevers by the crew to raise the wing
increased the longitudinal roll of the plane and kept the pilot from
taking timely corrective action.
   Investigators said the crew was not effectively sensitized to the
phenomenon or the importance of procedures.
   It should have increased takeoff speed and reduced the angle of
ascent because of the ice-forming conditions. Instead, the plane
stalled at a speed faster than normal for takeoff and at a lower
than usual angle of ascent.
   Earlier, investigators said the plane's operation and flight
manuals did not contain instructions to handle icing.
   But Enzo Pacia, lawyer for plane designer Jean Rech, said last
month the plane ``has an anti-icing system conforming with
international norms and the flight manuals and other technical
instruments are suitable so the plane can be flown without risk in
any weather conditions.''
   The indictments named Rech, a Frenchman and an official of
Aerospatiale company; the operations manager and three other ATI
officials reponsible for flight operations, manuals and pilots; an
official who certified the flight-worthiness of the ATR-42; and
three officials of the civil aviation office responsible for flight
manuals and authorizing flight routes.

   The government announced Monday it is
expelling three Australian diplomats from Belgrade in retaliation
for the closure of the Yugoslav consulate in Sydney.
   They must leave Belgrade within a week, state television reported.
   Australian Charge d'Affaires Peter Shannon said two first
secretaries and a second secretary have been ordered to leave with
their families _ a total of 14 people.
   The announcement came hours after 12 Yugoslav diplomats and
consular staff members expelled from Australia arrived in Belgrade
to a rousing official welcome.
   Foreign Ministry officials met them at the airport, where the
Yugoslav consul to Sydney, Stanojlo Glisic, held a news conference.
   Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans ordered the Sydney
consulate closed and gave the staff 72 hours to leave after the
Yugoslav government refused to hand over a consulate security
officer accused of shooting and seriously wounding a 16-year-old
during a Nov. 27 protest by 1,500 ethnic Croatians.
   Shannon said he told the Yugoslavs that none of the expelled
Australians ``could be considered to have breached international
diplomatic conventions or Yugoslav laws.''
   ``I was told explicitly that the action was in response to the
Australian government's closure of the consulate-general in
Sydney,'' he said in an interview.
   Security guard Zoran Matijas, wearing dark glasses and carrying
his 3-year-old daughter, said at the airport, ``I have not been
authorized to say anything.''
   The youth was shot in the throat when demonstrators scaled the
consulate walls and tried to tear down the Yugoslav flag.
   Consul Glisic defended Matijas' action, saying the guard fired
two warning shots during the demonstration.
   ``Zoran was defending me in what was a destructive attack on our
consulate,'' Glisic said. ``The circumstances of the wounding are
unclear. It has not been proven that Matijas did it.''
   Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar praised Matijas. ``He was
defending our territory. He was not attacking. Therefore we refused
to hand him over,'' he told Belgrade television Sunday.
   Loncar said his government will demand ``satisfaction'' for an
alleged Australian breach of the Vienna Consular Convention, under
which consular officials enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution
for acts performed in exercise of consular functions.
   He blamed the Australian government for the shooting, saying it
did not provide adequate police protection during the demonstration,
which he alleged was staged by Ustasha emigres.
   The Ustashas were Croation fascists allied with Nazi Germany
against Yugoslav resistance forces during World War II. Croatian
extremists have been charged with killing at least two Yugoslav
diplomats and wounding others in various attacks in the past 20
years.
   In a separate attack Sunday, extremists firebombed the car of
prominent Australian Yugoslav leader Momir Dacic in Adelaide, police
said Monday. No one was injured.
   Dacic, president of the community-based Yugoslav Center, blamed
Croatian emigres who he said claimed responsibility.
   About 200,000 Yugoslavs live in Australia.

   A holiday mail campaign for Terry Anderson,
facing his fourth Christmas as a hostage in Lebanon, has attracted
more than 7,000 cards from virtually every state and overseas, an
organizer said Monday.
   ``Here we had Thanksgiving and a lot of people were giving thanks
for the things we have, the freedom we have. With Christmas, we're
aware of not only Terry but all the hostages and all those less
fortunate,'' said Jack LaVriha of Lorain, who is directing the card
campaign for the Free Terry Anderson Committee. Anderson is a native
of Lorain, about 30 miles west of Cleveland.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, has been a captive since March 16, 1985.
   LaVriha, a retired newsman, said cards for Anderson have come
from as far away as the Philippines and from U.S. military post
offices around the world.
   ``We're getting a fantastic response from schools,'' said
LaVriha, who went to school with Anderson's father, Glenn Anderson,
who died in 1986 during his son's first year of captivity.
Anderson's brother also has died during the newsman's captivity.
   Many of the cards are handmade. Some are oversized or banners,
containing many names. LaVriha estimated that the cards include a
total of more than 10,000 signatures.
   The holiday greetings have come from schools such as Pearl
Elementary in Pearl, Miss., which sent 34 handmade cards. Nine
handmade cards came from a school in Milton, Utah.
   Sixty-three nursing home residents at Friendship House in
Hopkinsville, Ky., sent a card, and cards also came from Girl Scout
troops in Rochester, N.Y., and Antioch, Calif., from Walnut Creek
Intermediate School in Walnut Creek, Calif., and Adams School in
Enid., Okla.
   ``Even in the kindergarten classes the teachers have tried to
explain to the class, `Here is someone who is being held against his
will. He can't come home,''' LaVriha said.
   ``I'm told many of these kids actually cry. They become so
concerned. They know what it is like not to be able to go home to
your parents.''
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, speaking from her home in Cadiz,
Ky., said such campaigns on her brother's behalf play a key role.
   ``Every ex-hostage, including the French, attribute the publicity
about their plight to saving their lives at several different times
of crisis when their captors very strongly considered executing
them,'' she said.
   She said such card and letter campaigns also help keep the issue
alive in Washington. ``They are vitally important in letting our
administration know that the hostages are important to the American
people,'' she said.
   The Free Terry Anderson Committee plans to box the letters next
weekend.
   The cards are to be delivered to U.S. Rep. Donald Pease, D-Ohio,
who plans to ship them to the State Department and urge that they be
sent to Lebanon, according to his press secretary, Peg O'Laughlin.
   Frances Jones, spokeswoman for State Department's Bureau of
Consular Affairs, said, ``Unfortunately, as a practical matter it's
impossible for us to deliver cards because we don't know where the
hostages are.'' She said An Nahar newspaper in Beirut has offered to
receive mail on behalf of the hostages and suggested that the
committee might want to ship the cards there.
   ``There is no assurance this mail would be passed on, but
sometimes they print it,'' she said.

   Ulrike ``Uli'' Derickson, the TWA flight
attendant who protected American passengers from Arab gunmen during
a 1985 hijacking, has been tapped to receive the Navy's highest
civilian award, the service said Monday.
   Mrs. Derickson, who was chief flight attendant aboard TWA Flight
847 when it was hijacked on June 14, 1985, will visit the Pentagon
on Tuesday and receive the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award
from Navy Secretary William L. Ball III.
   ``Her courageous and heroic efforts to support and protect the
passengers, including Petty Officers Robert Stethem and Clinton
Suggs, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S.
Navy,'' the Navy said.
   Stethem, a Navy diver, was one of 39 Americans held captive for
17 days after the Athens-to-Rome flight was hijacked. He was shot
and killed by the hijackers despite Mrs. Derickson's efforts to
intervene on his behalf.
   Mrs. Derickson, who hid the passports of passengers with Jewish
sounding names, managed to stop the hijackers from beating Suggs.
   Last September, during courtroom testimony in West Germany where
one of the hijackers is being tried, Mrs. Derickson told how Stethem
``never made a sound'' despite a savage beating.
   The Navy said Mrs. Derickson would be accompanied to Tuesday's
ceremony by her husband and some of the Navy sailors who survived
the hijacking.

   Pioneer 12 was designed to orbit
Venus for just 243 days, but it chalked up a solid decade of work
Monday amid raves from the scientists who've kept the project
working.
   The space probe has helped map 93 percent of Venus' searing-hot
surface while providing a new understanding of volcanics and land
formation on Earth.
   It has sent scientists 10 trillion bits of data, including
information on the extreme ``greenhouse'' effect which appears to be
trapping the sun's heat and driving the planet's surface temperature
to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
   It also has allowed them to speculate on the ways in which Venus,
once thought to be the Earth's twin because of its similar size,
composition and the presence of continents, mountains and canyons,
is different from our home planet.
   ``We used to think when I was in school that Venus and Earth were
twin planets,'' said Donald Hunten, a professor of planetary
sciences at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary
Laboratory, said at a meeting of scientists celebrating Pioneer's
longevity. ``More recently, we've discovered they are really not
very alike at all.''
   Scientists at the meeting took the opportunity to call for a
return to unmanned space probes in addition to the far more costly
manned missions.
   Steven Dorfman, who works for Hughes Aircraft Co., a major
government space contractor, called for ``a return to a mix of small
and large programs,'' pointing out that the Pioneer project was
relatively cheap at less than $200 million in today's dollars.
   Dorfman said the United States launched 36 planetary launches in
the 1960s, but only 11 in the 1970s. Two are scheduled in this
decade.
   Although Venus has no oceans, Hunten said data suggests there may
have been enough water vapor to form an ocean 4 billion years ago.
   But high temperatures from the planet's severe ``greenhouse''
effect, in which clouds or pollution traps the sun's heat near the
planet's surface, may partially account for the differences between
Venus and Earth, he said.
   Additionally, extreme stratospheric pollution on Venus, where
chlorine is found at levels 100 to 1,000 times the concentration
found in the air above Earth, could further explain conditions on
Venus and provide a warning of our own future.
   ``Venus is not a living, breathing example, but a very dead
example of what a polluted atmosphere is like,'' said Hunten, adding
that the pollution on Venus is natural but the chemistry is the same
as on Earth.
   Lawrence Colin, Pioneer Venus project scientist, said the
anniversary is just ``a step along the way to many of us.''
   Pioneer's variable orbit, which responds to the effect of solar
gravity on Venus, has allowed the spacecraft to come as close as 93
miles to Venus and as distant as 1,426 miles.
   If plans are carried out on scheduled, next year the Magellan
mission will team up with Pioneer to provide high resolution radar
mapping of Venus' surface. In February 1990, Pioneer will be joined
by the Galileo probe when it passes Venus on its way to Jupiter.
   Pioneer will continue to sample Venus' environment, including
monitoring an entire 11-year sunspot cycle.
   In late 1991, it will sample Venus' upper atmosphere. In early
1992, it will begin to burn its remaining fuel supply to maintain an
orbit of 150 kilometers, ``or lower if we can,'' said Colin.
   When the fuel supply runs out, estimated at some time late in
1992, he added, ``Pioneer Venus will meet a fiery death, the end of
the mission.''

   American and Soviet religious leaders said
Monday the glasnost policy of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will
give churches in the Soviet Union more political clout.
   Meeting on the eve of Gorbachev's visit to the United States, in
which he will address the United Nations and meet with President
Reagan and President-elect George Bush, delegates to the
U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders Summit were optimistic Soviet clergy
even may be be allowed to run for legislative offices.
   ``The message is coming through loud and clear that Gorbachev's
initiatives are spilling over and touching upon religious life,''
said Rabbi Gary Zola of Cincinnati, dean of admissions at Hebrew
Union College. ``There is new interest in religious thought and
religious life and the government is not only permitting it but also
is fostering it.''
   Religion and politics are among the topics being addressed at the
weeklong summit ending Wednesday. The summit is sponsored by the
Columbus, Ind.-based American Center for International Leadership
and the Soviet Union's Committee of Youth Organizations.
   Soviet delegates were optimistic Gorbachev's visit with U.S.
officials would be productive.
   ``I hope Gorbachev and President Reagan will advance negotiations
on nuclear disarmament and lead the way for more success with George
Bush,'' said Andrei Rybin, 32, a priest in Moscow's Russian Orthodox
Church.
   Nikolai Mukhin, a member of the U.S.S.R. Council of Religious
Affairs, said, ``I'm sure there will be some initiatives reached for
a continuing dialogue with Bush next year.''
   On the issue of religious freedom in their own country, the
Soviet delegates said Gorbachev's policy of openness is letting
church leaders speak out without fear of reprisal for the first time
in more than 50 years.
   ``We will have a constructive role in the secular society,
especially in terms of culture and self-determination,'' Rybin said.
``Religion will be more open. The Communist Party remains atheistic
in principle, but it now recognizes the role of the church and that
it had been neglecting it.''
   Mukhin, who admitted he's ``not a believer,'' said that under the
new laws ``religious leaders will be able to be elected to
legislative bodies. ... The whole situation is developing in the
direction of Lenin's idea that people are entitled to have freedom
of conscience.''
   Rabbi David Wortman, executive director of the Jewish Community
Relations Council of Greater Philadelphia, said he found ``a
significant change'' in the Soviet position on the issue of allowing
Jews to emigrate.
   ``What was different is that they clearly supported the position
that every person should have the right to emigrate and this gives
rise to cautious optimism,'' Wortman said.
   Rybin said, ``On the problem of Jewish emigration there were many
opinions but we all recognize that every human being has the right
to go and live wherever he wants, and that is the declaration of
human rights we support, not only for Jews but for everybody.''

   Paul Kirk announced plans Monday to step aside
as Democratic national chairman when his term expires, setting up a
free-for-all when the party picks a new leader early next year.
   Kirk, who had been beseeched by many top-ranking Democrats to
seek a new term, told a news conference that when he took the job in
1985, ``The time I set for myself was four years.''
   ``My plans are as they were at the beginning, which is to return
to the practice of law,'' said the 50-year-old native of Boston. He
quickly added he does not intend to become a ``political dropout.''
   Several candidates for chairman already were jockeying for
position in the event of Kirk's decision to step aside. Ronald H.
Brown, a longtime party activist who played a key role in Jesse
Jackson's campaign, is expected to announce his plans to seek the
post at a news conference Tuesday morning.
   Michigan Party chairman Richard Wiener also said he would run for
the post and said, ``I feel confident I can win.''
   Former Rep. Jim Jones of Oklahoma also said he expected to make
an announcement next Monday. Jones, who practices law in Washington,
said he had contacted some party officials last month and received
encouragement to run for the job if Kirk stepped down.
   Former Rep. Mike Barnes of Maryland said, ``I'm running.'' Former
Rep. Jim Stanton of Ohio also has expressed an interest in the post.
   The Democratic National Committee meets Feb. 9-10 in Washington
to pick a new chairman.
   Kirk won praise for his work even as the competition to succeed
him began.
   ``He leaves the chairmanship with our party rejuvenated and
prepared for the future,'' said Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
the party's losing presidential candidate this year.
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, said Kirk's tenure was
excellent and added his departure makes it ``much more difficult to
arrive at a choice without some bloodshed.''
   Kirk said in departing that his purpose had been to ``give
something back and to leave something better than existed before I
was given the honor and the opportunity to serve.''
   He said repeatedly at his news conference that the party was
better off financially and politically than it was four years ago.
He said his biggest disappointment was the loss of the presidential
race last month.
   ``During these four years I have spoken of the value of politics,
and I have worked to practice the politics of values and to enhance
respect for our political parties and for public life and our public
institutions.''
   Kirk said at the news conference he expected a ``spirited
contest'' in the campaigning to pick his successor, but disputed a
suggestion that Democrats are in for a bloodletting.
   Brown alone among the potential successors had not ruled out
challenging Kirk for the job. He is viewed with suspicion by some
party leaders because of his close association with Jackson, a black
liberal who is expected to run for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1992.
   Kirk is a native of Massachusetts who earned his political
stripes as a lieutenant to liberal Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts.
   He was viewed with suspicion by many in the party when he waged
his winning campaign for the chairmanship, but by the time the
Democratic State Chairs met in Arizona last month, an effort to
draft him for a second term was well under way. Kirk said defeated
presidential candidate Dukakis, Bentsen, the party's congressional
leadership and numerous governors had all urged him to remain in the
job.
   Kirk said little about his own plans, but confirmed widespread
reports he had held a discussion with the owner of the San Diego
Padres, Joan Kroc, about taking a job with the baseball team. He
said he doubted anything would come of it.

   President Reagan on Monday used the onset of
the holiday season to remind Americans about the heavy costs of
driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs.
   Reagan called drug-influenced driving ``dangerous and
irresponsible behavior that no one should engage in, tolerate or
permit.''
   He proclaimed the week of Dec. 11-17 as ``National Drunk and
Drugged Driving Awareness Week,'' carrying out the wishes of
Congress as expressed in a Senate joint resolution.
   ``We can all help improve safety on our roads and highways by
refusing to tolerate drunk and drugged driving, by always wearing
seat belts, even for short drives, and by insisting upon prompt and
effective action against alcohol- and drug-impaired drivers,'' the
proclamation said.

   George Bush gave and received advice on federal
budget constraints and education Monday in a meeting with university
presidents, who generally praised the man who has vowed to be ``the
education president.''
   ``He reaffirmed that commitment to us today in no uncertain
terms,'' said Benno Schmidt Jr., president of Yale University,
Bush's alma mater.
   ``We recognize that we have a friend of education in the White
House. We're excited and grateful for that,'' Schmidt said at the
outset of the hour-long discussion with Bush, Vice President-elect
Dan Quayle, Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, New Hampshire Gov.
John Sununu, the future White House chief of staff, and transition
co-director Robert Teeter.
   Bush did not join the presidents in speaking to reporters after
the meeting.
   The university chiefs said they had discussed the importance of
the federal role in ensuring access to higher education; a need to
support scientific research on campuses, and a shortage of
scientists and engineers, especially among members of minority
groups.
   Bush aides said Schmidt suggested the meeting and put together
the group, which included: Lamar Alexander, University of Tennessee;
William Cunningham, University of Texas at Austin; William Danforth,
chancellor, Washington University; James Duderstadt, University of
Michigan; David Gardner, University of California; Paul Gray,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Frank Rhodes, Cornell
University; Ronald Roskens, University of Nebraska. William Friday,
former president of the University of North Carolina, also attended.
   Schmidt said Bush ``stressed the limits on federal resources and
the need to make hard choices about the federal budget to bring the
deficit under control.'' He said the presidents understood that and
agreed to help Bush by setting carefully ``the educational
priorities and the science research priorities in the country.''
   ``We discussed the essential importance of maintaining the
openness and accessibility of higher education so that all our young
people can aspire to the best that our education system offers,''
Schmidt said.
   ``We expressed our great concern at the shortage of well-educated
people in science and engineering in this country,'' said Schmidt,
who cited the dearth of minorities in these professions.
   The university presidents were all white males.
   Rhodes said the president-elect reiterated his campaign pledge to
``upgrade the position of science adviser to the president'' and
appoint a presidential advisory council on science and technology.
   Alexander, former governor of Tennessee, said federal research
and development has grown by 50 percent after inflation during the
Reagan administration. But much of that spurt has been in military
R&D.
   Rhodes said, ``What we've got to do is to reallocate within the
funds already existing for R&D, and that's a tough decision that
needs to be done with expert help.''
   Alexander, a Bush education adviser during the campaign, said,
``We didn't try to lecture the vice president. We tried to say ...
we're here to help.''
   Gardner said the campus presidents also mentioned West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's interest in expanding international
education and scholarly exchanges with the United States. Gardner
said Bush was ``very understanding of it. He had already talked with
Chancellor Kohl ... and has an intense interest.''
   Schmidt, asked if he were troubled by Bush's campaign digs at
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis and Dukakis' ``Havard Yard''
advisers, said, ``I did not take that too seriously.''
   But, he added, ``any concerns expressed about Harvard in that
regard would also be entirely appropriate with respect to Yale. We
both stand for excellence and we're both very proud of what we stand
for.''

   Two former nurse's aides were arraigned on
murder charges Monday in the death of patients at a nursing home
where eight people died suspiciously, authorities said.
   Both women worked at the Alpine Manor Nursing Home when the
patients died, Police Chief Walter Sprenger said. Officials
originally believed the patients died of natural causes.
   Catherine May Wood, 26 of Grand Rapids, who worked at the home in
this Grand Rapids suburb from 1985 until October, was charged with
two counts of murder in the deaths last year of two terminally ill
patients, a 98-year-old woman and a 60-year-old woman.
   Gwendolyn Gail Graham, 25, who worked at the home from 1986 to
1987 and now lives in Texas, faced one charge of murder in the death
of the 98-year-old woman.
   Autopsies after the two bodies were exhumed failed to determine
the cause of the two deaths, authorities said. Six other deaths at
the nursing home last year are also under investigation, authorities
said.
   Sprenger said police are investigating reports some victims had
been suffocated.
   He declined to speculate on a motive or to label the deaths mercy
killings. ``I cannot share evidence that will be detrimental to the
case,'' he said.
   He said detectives have investigated but been unable to confirm
allegations that the suspects may have begun choosing their victims
based on initials of the victims' names, which they hoped to use to
spell the word M-U-R-D-E-R.
   The first name of one of the people whose deaths were cited in
the charges Monday began with an ``M,'' the other with an ``E.''
Authorities have declined to give the names of the other six people
whose deaths are under investigation. ``It's a complex motive,''
Sprenger said. ``It's a complex case. It's so complex it's going to
take a lengthy trial ... to make a lot of sense.''
   Reporters were turned away from the nursing home Monday by a
private security guard.
   ``Alpine Manor is devastated but relieved ... that something is
being done,'' Ginny Seyferth, spokeswoman for Alpine Manor, said at
a news conference. ``Both (women) had very good reviews. Both were
well-liked by the patients.
   ``I think the staff is overwhelmed,'' she said, adding that
counseling was being provided for employees.
   Sprenger said nursing home officials were not to blame for the
deaths. ``There was nothing they could have done to prevent it,'' he
said.
   Ms. Wood was arrested early Monday and was ordered held without
bond in the Kent County Jail here, pending another hearing Dec. 16.
Ms. Graham was arrested Sunday night by authorities in Tyler, Texas.
She was ordered held on $1 million bond, and Michigan authorities
said they would seek extradition.
   In both cases, the murder charges brought against the women were
``open,'' meaning the degree of murder was not immediately specified.
   Sprenger said the women were arrested in the deaths of Marguerite
Chambers, 60, and Edith Cook, 98. Other bodies may be exhumed, and
further charges were possible, he said. Three of the eight people
whose deaths are under investigation were cremated.
   The sheriff refused to say if either woman had confessed or made
any comment to authorities.
   The Grand Rapids Press reported that the women lived together
while working at the nursing home. After leaving Michigan, Ms.
Graham worked as a nurse's aide at a hospital in Texas until
recently, the newspaper said.
   The eight deaths occurred during January-April 1987. At the time,
the deaths were considered to be from natural causes and no
autopsies were conducted.
   Sprenger said detectives began investigating the deaths in early
October, using a list of ``eight potential victims'' provided by a
source he refused to identify.
   About 40 patients died at the nursing home during January-April
1987, said Seyferth. She said that was lower than the normal death
rate for such a facility. Alpine has 208 patients.

<HEAD>Mobile Methadone Van Takes To Streets Against Heroin Addiction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first mobile methadone van is being
geared up to serve the working-class community of Brockton and
possibly others in an effort to assuage neighborhood worries without
giving up the fight against heroin.
   The van was the brainchild of Massachusetts officials seeking a
way around neighborhood objections to the opening of a permanent
clinic for heroin addicts.
   ``It's part of a statewide drug treatment strategy,'' said John
Stobierski of the state Department of Public Health, which is
overseeing the project.
   Methadone, a synthetic substitute for heroin, is given to addicts
to reduce their craving for the drug.
   The van, a version of which has been tried successfully in
Europe, would operate out of the police station parking lot in
Brockton, a city 20 miles south of Boston. Operators of the van made
a dry run Monday without providing methadone services.
   ``It provides us with the flexibility to bring the service into
communities,'' Stobierski said. ``There was some concern in Brockton
over the siting of a methadone service. We broached the idea of
using the van.''
   Brockton Mayor Carl Pitaro has not given final approval for the
van to operate permanently out of Brockton, said mayoral aide John
Buckley. The city is seeking an agreement with the state that would
limit the amount of time the van spent in Brockton and would
restrict the van's clients to Brockton residents.
   Dennis McCarty of the health department's Division of Substance
Abuse said the van was designed to address Brockton's concerns about
addicts flocking to their city.
   ``One concern is that programs (in buildings) tend to draw people
from a wide geographic area,'' McCarty said. ``By having a mobile
program, we have a chance to reach out to other communities without
burdening any one community too much.''
   McCarty said similar van programs are being considered for other
parts of the state.
   The Brockton methadone program stems from a Public Health
Department effort aimed as much at stopping the spread of AIDS as at
combating heroin addiction. The virus that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrom can be spread through the sharing of hypodermic
needles.
   The state estimates there are 600 to 800 needle-using addicts in
Brockton, but opponents of the methadone program say those numbers
are inflated. Fifty to 70 heroin addicts are expected to receive
methadone treatment at the van during the initial stage of its
operation.
   According to David Mulligan, Public Health director of substance
abuse, some 300 addicts are already in treatment in Brockton, 20
percent of whom use methadone.
   Stobierski said state officials confirmed the van was the first
in the nation because it required approval from federal health
officials and the approval was the first of its kind.

   Law enforcement officials are preparing the
ultimate in security for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
three-day visit this week to New York City and forecasting one of
the worst traffic nightmares in years _ ``Gorbylock.''
   ``Security will be probably as comprehensive and as important as
any visit we have had in years and years,'' said Gillian Martin
Sorensen, the city's liaison to the United Nations.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev is scheduled to address the General
Assembly, and have lunch with President Reagan and President-elect
George Bush, as well as other U.S. and Soviet officials.
   ``We're talking about one of the superpowers and a visit by a
very important world leader,'' Ms. Sorensen said. ``It will be
ultimate security; the New York City Police Department and the
Secret Service will do all they can do.''
   When asked how the security was going to affect the city's
motorists, Joe O'Brien, a spokesman for the city's Transportation
Department, summed it up in one word: ``Gorbylock.''
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, are expected to stay at the Soviet
Mission to the United Nations, at 136 East 67th St., a short drive
from the U.N. complex.
   Gorbachev's itinerary, released by the Police Department on
Monday, includes a visit to the observation deck atop one of the
World Trade Center towers after the Soviet leader's luncheon meeting
Wednesday.
   Gorbachev's 45-car motorcade is then to ride past the New York
Stock Exchange and head up to Times Square _ all in the heart of
rush hour, on avenues closed for the convenience of the visitors and
to the torment of local drivers.
   On Thursday, Gorbachev is to attend a Soviet trade show at the
Jacob Javits Convention Center, then head across town for a visit to
Central Park and a look at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's European
paintings.
   Police also said Mrs. Gorbachev might visit a department store,
but they did not say which one or when. Speculation had centered on
Macy's and Bloomingdale's, although a Soviet official noted that a
trip to the former was problematic because of crowds attracted by
its pre-Christmas sales.
   On Friday morning the Gorbachevs would go directly to Kennedy
Airport for a flight to Cuba, police said.
   During his last visit to the United States, the Soviet leader
made an unexpected stop in downtown Washington to greet the
lunchtime crowd, and Chief Robert Johnston Jr., indicated the New
York police are prepared for such an occurrence.
   ``We have contingency plans,'' he said.
   Security is expected to be tight because of the past history of
anti-Soviet incidents here, some linked to members of the militant
Jewish Defense League.
   A tear gas bomb forced the opening night audience for the
Moiseyev Dance Company to flee from the Metropolitan Opera on Sept.
2, 1986. There was a bomb scare when the Bolshoi Ballet opened at
Lincoln Center in July 1987. A car at the Soviet residential complex
in the Bronx was firebombed in 1984.
   Five protest groups have obtained permits to demonstrate outside
the United Nations during Gorbachev's appearance before the General
Assembly, including the Coalition for Soviet Jewry, the Students for
Soviet Jewry and organizations representing Afghans, Ukrainians and
Armenians.
   Police spokesman Sgt. Peter Sweeney said, ``This is going to be a
major, major operation by the New York City Police Department, in
both manpower and traffic problems.''
   Police Chief Robert Johnston Jr., said 6,600 officers will be
assigned to work overtime on the visit at a cost of more than $1
million. ``We are going to document every cop's assignment and apply
for reimbursement to the State Department,'' he said.
   The police will coordinate the security effort with the Secret
Service, the State Department and the United Nation's 250-member
police force.
   When asked to characterize the force that will be in place,
Anthony O'Connell, the United Nation's security chief, said ``the
standards of security that are normal at this headquarters for the
visits of heads of state.''
   When about 90 heads of government attended the United Nation's
40th anniversary, hundreds of city police, as well as teams of
police scuba divers, helicopter patrols and mounted officers watched
the events, conscious of possible terrorist attacks.
   The Police Harbor Unit stationed patrol boats off the U.N.
complex on the East River around the clock. Teams of police divers
performed daily searches of the riverfront piers for bombs
   In 1981, when Prince Charles of Britain paid a one-day visit to
New York City, and lunched with President and Mrs. Reagan, he was
guarded by a 2,000-member security force, which included 1,725 city
police officers.
   The biggest and most costly security and crowd and traffic
control operation was the October 1979 visit of Pope John Paul II.
The two-day papal visit involved more than 13,000 city police
officers and cost more than $3 million.

   Three news organizations filed suit Monday to
force the bipartisan National Economic Commission to meet in public
when it discusses economic forecasts and ways to cut the federal
budget.
   The lawsuit filed in federal court seeks an injunction to bar the
commission from closing its scheduled Dec. 12 meeting to the public.
The suit contends that a secret proceeding would violate a federal
open-meeting law.
   The commission scheduled the closed session to discuss which
economic forecast to adopt as a basis for making future
recommendations and to review various budget-cutting options.
   ``If the commission is permitted to deny the public access to its
discussion of economic assumptions and its review of budget options,
the public will be deprived of an essential tool of democracy,''
said the lawsuit by The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and
the Bureau of National Affairs, which publishes financial
newsletters.
   The lawsuit was also joined by consumer advocate Ralph Nader's
Public Citizen and Stephen Wildstrom, an editor for Business Week.
   It seeks a temporary restraining order to prevent the commission
from holding the Dec. 12 meeting in private and a declaration that
closed sessions violate the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green scheduled a hearing for 10
a.m. Wednesday.
   The commission held three so-called briefing sessions last summer
without a quorum of the 12-member panel present in order to avoid
the open-meeting requirements. Officials discontinued that practice
after objections were raised.
   But Alexander Platt, the commission's general counsel, said the
panel intended to go ahead with the closed session on Dec. 12. He
said it was covered under a section of law that allows such
discussions to be private if premature disclosure of the
deliberations would frustrate an agency's actions.
   ``We believe we understand the proper application of the Federal
Advisory Committee Act and we have followed every appropriate
procedure in closing the meeting. We intend to hold the closed
session on Dec. 12,'' he said.
   Jim Hildreth, spokesman for the commission, said that the
advisory panel was also worried that financial markets could be
affected by partial news reports on the deliberations.
   Platt cited this concern to the plaintiffs in a letter that
referred to a sharp drop in the financial markets following the Nov.
16 appearance of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, the
complaint said.
   Greenspan's recommendation that the president take urgent steps
to reduce the federal deficit was cited by some observers as a cause
of the drop in the stock market.
   The complaint said the news organizations ``are particularly
interested in the commission's discussion of economic assumptions
becuse it will greatly influence if not determine what the
commission forecasts for the national economy.''
   The commission has also scheduled an open meeting on Wednesday to
hear witnesses from the Congressional Budget Office discuss the
economic assumptions they will provide Congress.

<HEAD>Congressman, Fire Fighters Call for Probe of Fatal Kansas City Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Congressional Fire Services
Caucus and representatives of the nation's fire fighters called
Monday for investigations of the Nov. 29 fire and explosion in
Kansas City, Mo., that killed six firemen.
   Caucus chairman Rep. Curt Weldon, D-Pa., a former firefighter,
told a Capitol Hill news conference that government support for such
services is insufficient and he complained that fire safety becomes
an issue only after major incidents occur.
   ``Unfortunately, the fire service community, of which I have been
a part virtually all of my life, must seize tragic opportunities
such as this to emphasize the real need for greater awareness to the
fire problem in America,'' said Weldon, who was joined at the news
conference by representatives for the nation's fire fighters.
   Weldon accused local, state, and federal government agencies of
providing ``modest, to little, to no resources,'' for fire services,
and called for the establishment of comprehensive safety regulations
regarding hazardous materials for emergency response employees.
   The six firefighters were killed when a construction trailer
loaded with 30,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate exploded, ripping a
large crater in the ground and virtually obliterating a fire truck.
Investigators determined arson to be the probable cause.
   Weldon said that he has requested a full investigation into the
circumstances surrounding that incident and that the administrator
of the U.S. Fire Administration, part of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, had agreed to conduct the probe.
   Alfred K. Whitehead, president of the International Association
of Fire Fighters, requested a congressional inquiry into the matter
as well, saying, ``I am hopeful the Congress will address the
question of fire department notifications, hazardous materials
training for emergency response teams and the quantities of
hazardous materials appropriate for community safety.
   ``What took place in Kansas City can take place in nearly every
community in America,'' Whitehead said.
   Jim Estepp, a spokesman for the International Association of Fire
Chiefs, said his organization joined with Weldon and other fire
associations in ``asking that the deaths of these fire fighters not
be in vain and that the new administration and Congress will keep
the needs of the nation's fire and emergency service as a major
priority to maintain the safety of the public and of fire fighters.''
   The Congressional Fire Services Caucus is one of the largest on
Capitol Hill and has 277 members from the House of Representatives
and the Senate.

<HEAD>Bush Invites Mrs. Dole for Breakfast Amid Job Rumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush, who has promised
to recruit more women and minorities to top jobs in his
administration, has invited former Cabinet member Elizabeth Dole to
breakfast on Tuesday, her husband's aides said Monday.
   Mrs. Dole, a former transportation secretary and wife of Senate
minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., has been rumored to be in line for
a top job, possibly that of ambassador to the United Nations.
   On Sunday, Walt Riker, Dole's spokesman, said it was ``simply a
rumor'' that Mrs. Dole would be tapped as the U.N. ambassador. There
has also been speculation that Mrs. Dole could be a candidate to
head the Department of Health and Human Services, although she is
not considered a leading contender for that job.
   Susan Pelter, another aide to Dole, confirmed that Mrs. Dole, now
a private citizen, would meet Bush on Tuesday at his office.
   Mrs. Dole did not return a telephone call to discuss her future.
Alixe Glen, a spokeswoman for the Bush transition office, said she
had no information about appointments.
   Mrs. Dole, a Harvard-trained lawyer from Salisbury, N.C., quit
her post at transportation in late 1987 to campaign full-time for
her husband in his failed attempt to gain the Republican
presidential nomination.
   After Bush won the GOP nomination, Mrs. Dole worked for him,
campaigning frequently among evangelical groups. Before she went to
the Transportation Department, she work for President Reagan as a
White House liaison with women and minorities. She also has been a
member of the Federal Trade Commission.
   So far, no woman has been given a high-level job by Bush.
   There was no hint when Bush would make other appointments to top
jobs, including that of defense secretary. Bush spends Tuesday in
Washington and travels to New York on Wednesday for a meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Former Sen. John Tower, D-Texas, is still thought to have the
inside track for defense secretary. The Washington Times reported
that Norman Augustine, the president of Martin Marietta Corp., a
defense contractor, would take the No. 2 slot at the Pentagon.
   Bill Harwood, Augustine's spokesman, said he could not confirm
the report. Other sources close to the transition, speaking on
condition they remain anonymous, said Augustine was the type of
management expert who might work well with Tower to control Pentagon
spending.
   Augustine, a former Pentagon official, has writtren extensively
about eforming the procurement process.
   Meantime, jockeying continued for jobs at the State Department,
which will be headed by James Baker III.
   Two of the contenders for Assistant Secretary of State for
European Affairs are Richard Haas, who specialized in Greek and
Turkish affairs and now teaches at Harvard; and James Dobbins, a
specialist on Western and North Europe who is a deputy to the U.S.
ambassador to West Germany.

   A former associate of political maverick
Lyndon LaRouche testified Monday that LaRouche exhorted his
followers to raise large sums of money to help him save humanity
from nuclear destruction and berated those who failed to meet
fund-raising quotas as suffering ``sexual impotence.''
   Steven J. Bardwell also described a ``boiler room'' fund-raising
operation in LaRouche's Los Angeles office as the mail and tax fraud
conspiracy trial of the perennial presidential candidate entered its
third week in U.S. District Court.
   Wayne Hintz, a former national finance officer for the LaRouche
organization, testified later that at his urging, the organization's
executive committee left the impression in April 1985 it would
allocate $80,000 per week to increased repayment of outstanding
loans. But Hintz said the actual funds received for that purpose
never exceeded about $38,000 weekly.
   Meanwhile, Hintz said the total debt was growing because of new
borrowing. He said the debt rose from about $10 million in late 1984
to $40 million by late 1985, with $4.5 million in total interest
owed.
   Bardwell, former editor of Fusion magazine, a LaRouche
publication, said LaRouche outlined his fund-raising philosophy
before enthusiastic followers in a speech in the Bronx, N.Y., in
January 1984.
   Bardwell said LaRouche demanded ``tremendous amounts of money''
to finance his speaking tours and television appearances and to
provide protection against assassination attempts. ``He justified
any means short of thievery and thuggery to raise this money,''
Bardwell said.
   ``He said the human race was on the verge of self-destruction,''
said Bardwell, who was associated with LaRouche for nearly 12 years.
``He said they lacked the moral fiber to survive.''
   LaRouche said the human race would be destroyed by nuclear war if
sufficient money were not raised to finance his operations, Bardwell
said. ``He compared the human race to lemmings rushing to their own
destruction.''
   In every speech, Bardwell said, LaRouche said the main reason
some of his followers were failing to meet their fund-raising quotas
``was sexual impotence or sexual problems,'' and he frequently
referred to them as ``swine.''
   Bardwell said LaRouche berated organizers who hadn't raised
enough money ``for contributing to the likelihood that he and his
wife would be assassinated.''
   Bardwell, of Hastings on Hudson, N.Y., who resigned from the
LaRouche organization in February 1984 because of a dispute over
defense policy and money questions, said he complained frequently to
LaRouche about diversion of money raised from subscriptions to
Bardwell's magazine, a publication of the LaRouche-sponsored Fusion
Energy Foundation.
   He said LaRouche responded that Bardwell's sense of obligation to
his subscribers was ``misplaced'' and that ``whether or not they
knew it, they had contributed money to support Lyndon LaRouche and
his ideas.''
   LaRouche also said his personal security took precedence over all
other demands on his organization's revenues.
   LaRouche and six associates are charged with mail fraud and
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $30 million in loans with
no intention of repaying them.
   LaRouche is charged separately with conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses paid
from funds of various corporations he controls. Prosecutors say
LaRouche has not filed any federal income tax returns since 1978.
   LaRouche has denied any wrongdoing and complained that he is the
victim of government harassment. If convicted on all 13 counts
against him, LaRouche faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison
and fines totaling $3.25 million.
   LaRouche's co-defendants, who face lesser sentences if convicted
of the mail fraud and conspiracy charges, are William Wertz, his
chief fund-raiser; chief legal adviser Edward Spannaus; and
fund-raisers Michael Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and
Joyce Rubinstein.
   Bardwell testified that when he visited LaRouche's Los Angeles
office in 1983 he saw several rooms which LaRouche had called
``boiler rooms'' where telephone solicitors worked 10 hours to 12
hours a day trying to meet team quotas of $600 to $700 daily.
   The fund-raising effort was ``very closely monitored by Will
Wertz,'' who posted periodic reports from the main office, shopping
centers and the Los Angeles airport on a bulletin board on his wall.
Bardwell said LaRouche was highly pleased by the success of his Los
Angeles fund-raisers, who were the best in the country.
   In other testimony, Celia Landegger of Bronxville, N.Y., said she
gave LaRouche solicitors $45,000 in loans over a one-year period
ending in November 1985, but never had been repaid except for
interest payments totaling $1,300.
   She said Ms. Rubinstein at one point extended the payment
deadline until January 1987, two years after the initial loan was
supposed to be repaid, but no payments were received.

<HEAD>Panel OKs Research Using Intentionally Aborted Fetuses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special National Institutes of Health
advisory committee formalized on Monday its finding that it is
``acceptable'' for the federal government to back medical research
involving the transplant of tissue from intentionally aborted fetal
tissue.
   The 16-member panel spent a full day refining the wording of a
lengthy report drafted in two earlier meetings. However, no
substantive changes were made and the final report, like earlier
drafts, carefully avoided taking a position on the morality of
abortion itself or the morality of using tissue from such legally
performed procedures.
   There was no recorded vote on the key question of whether to
recommend fetal tissue research, but rather a series of separate
votes taken on final wording of various subsections of the report.
   However, the tally at an Oct. 21 meeting had been 13-3 in favor
of recommending that fetal tissue research proceed. That specific
question had been the focus of that meeting. That sentiment was
reflected in a minority report written by the same three dissenting
members and made part of the final document under the heading
``additional comments.''
   The recommendation now goes to a standing NIH advisory committee
that is meeting Dec. 14. That committee, in turn, will make its
recommendation to NIH Director James Wyngaarden.
   Researchers hope that transplanting fetal brain cells into the
brains of people with diabetes and Parkinson's disease could provide
an effective treatment _ perhaps in three to five years _ and that
more study could lead to similar treatments for a number of other
serious diseases for which no cure has been found.
   The panel's recommendation contains a number of guidelines to
guard against women being encouraged, even subtly, to have an
abortion in order to provide fetal tissue for research.
   For example, the committee said there should be no payment for
the tissue, beyond actual costs, and that donations of fetal tissue
to a family member or acquaintance should be banned lest women be
tempted to become pregnant just so they could conceive a fetus for
subsequent abortion and research use.

   Two guerrilla groups declared a truce
with government forces in a bid for peace talks, and police said
Monday a rebel group that has vowed never to negotiate attacked a
nortwestern town.
   About 40 men and women of the People's Liberation Army raided the
town of Union in Antioquia state, hurling grenades and firing
automatic rifles, said a national police news release. It reported
one officer wounded.
   Insurgents declaring the cease-fire were the April 19 Movement,
known as M-19, and the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, known
by its Spanish initials FARC.
   They have been the most active in more than 30 years of campaigns
against Colombian governments by half a dozen guerrilla groups.
   M-19 leaders sent their proposal to the Bogota newspapers El
Siglo and La Prensa on Sunday. The FARC sent a taped message Sunday
to Sen. Alvaro Leyva Duran, the senator told a news conference
Monday.
   Leyva said the message was from Jacobo Arenas, who started the
guerrillla group 35 years ago, and ``I think this is very good news
for the country.''
   Last month, Leyva proposed a cease-fire and negotiation plan
under which President Virgilio Barco would name a panel to decide in
30 days whether peace talks were possible. If the commission
recommended negotiations, they would begin within 50 days.
   Barco's government did not respond immediately to Leyva's latest
announcement. Both M-19 and FARC accepted the original Leyva
proposal two weeks ago, but a presidential spokesman said no talks
could be held until the rebels stopped their attacks.
   Cesar Gaviria, the spokesman, called the senator's proposal a
step toward peace. Several attempts at cease-fires and negotiations
in the last four years have failed.

   A criminal court Monday sentenced the
sister-in-law of Pakistan Premier Benazir Bhutto to two years in
prison after convicting her in connection with her husband's death.
   Rehana Bhutto is living in the United States and did not appear
at her own trial to face charges of ``non-assistance to a person in
danger.''
   The charges stem from the poisoning death of her husband, Shah
Nawaz Bhutto, in July 1985 at the couple's apartment in Cannes on
the Riviera.
   At the time, nearly the whole Bhutto family were living in exile
on the French Mediterranean coast, including the widow of former
Prime Minister Ali Bhutto who was overthrown and hanged in 1977, his
two sons, Shah Nawaz and Murtaza and their wives.
   Shah Narwaz, who was a leader of the Pakistani opposition,
apparently died of poison from a vial he carried for use if he was
caught by his enemies, testimony revealed.
   Rehana Bhutto discovered his body in the room next to hers only
hours after the poisoning. In her initial interrogation, she told
investigators she heard her husband moaning in his room but paid no
attention because she was angry with him.
   She was jailed for nearly two months while police investigated
the case and then, because the charges were minor, she was released
so she could be with her child in the United States.

<HEAD>FAA Cites Progress on Improving Control-Tower Operations at O'Hare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has
completed action on six of 102 measures it proposed to improve
control-tower operations at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport,
aides to Sen. Paul Simon said Monday.
   Simon's office released a report from the FAA outlining progress
on its plans to reduce flight-handling errors by air traffic
controllers at O'Hare.
   Controllers at the nation's busiest airport committed 30 such
errors in the first 10 months of 1988, surpassing the previous
record of 22 mistakes in 1986 and 12 in 1987.
   Responding to a Senate resolution demanding a timetable for
improvements, the agency submitted a detailed action plan to Simon,
D-Ill., in October and promised him monthly status reports.
   Press secretary David Carle said the most noteworthy measures
outlined in the first update were adding five experienced
controllers to the O'Hare tower, replacing aircraft situation
display equipment there and at a regional traffic center in Aurora,
Ill., and acquiring additional display equipment which will be
installed later.
   Although the FAA listed six recommendations as ``closed,''
including the addition of the situation display equipment and
budgeting money for overtime pay, the designation does not mean a
proposal was adopted.
   For example, the agency said a proposal to modify a telephone
system to allow conference calls among various personnel handling a
flight was closed because the system changes were not practical.
   A proposal to add consoles for training was closed because it
said FAA personnel in Chicago advised the agency no additional
consoles were needed.
   Other steps listed as ``closed'' were reviewing ``swap'' control
procedures with the industry and speeding the installation of a
communications switching system.
   ``There are no major problems with the existing (switching)
system, and AT&T assured the FAA that they can maintain the existing
system at O'Hare for at least the next five years,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly on Monday adopted a
package of resolutions deploring South Africa's apartheid system,
and noted that Japan is the leading trading partner of the minority
white-ruled nation.
   One resolution singled out Israel and ``certain Western states''
for criticism because of their continued military, nuclear,
intelligence and technological trade and collaboration with South
Africa.
   The General Assembly passes similar anti-apartheid resolutions
every year.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   The resolution condemning military collaboration with South
Africa passed 123-2, with 29 abstentions. Israel, which was
criticized by name, and the United States voted against it. Most
Western nations, including Australia and New Zealand, and Japan
abstained.
   U.S. delegate Harvey Nelson said the United States opposed the
resolution because it explicitly criticized Israel ``for actions
which many have committed, including some of those who protest most
loudly.''
   Another resolution calling on Israel to end its collaboration
with South Africa, particularly its long-term contracts for military
supplies, passed 106-23, with 26 abstentions.
   Numerous Western nations opposed that resolution because it
singled out one nation for what they called unproductive criticism.
Canada, the United States, and the 12 European Community nations
took that view.
   The resolution calling for comprehensive and mandatory economic
sanctions against South Africa passed 123-12, with 19 abstentions.
Japan was mentioned in the text as South Africa's largest trade
partner.
   Japanese Ambassador Hideo Kagami contended the resolution gave
the false impression that Japan has been increasing its trade with
South Africa.
   He said Japanese trade as measured in yen had declined every year
since 1984. A rise in trade as measured in dollars merely reflected
the fall of the dollar against the yen, he said.
   That resolution called for the Security Council to make economic
sanctions mandantory and appealed to Britain and the United States
not to continue using their veto power to block enforced sanctions.
   The 12 opposition votes were from Western Europe, Canada, Japan
and Israel.
   A resolution expressing international solidarity with the
``liberation struggle'' against South Africa passed 131-3, with 21
abstentions by most of the Western allies. The United States,
Britain and Portugal voted against the measure.
   The resolution called for full support for the African National
Congress, the black guerrilla group fighting the South African
government; and affirmed the right to used armed struggle in pursuit
of liberation.
   Portugal's second-ranking diplomat, Jose Caetano da Costa
Pereira, said his country opposed apartheid but could not support
the endorsement of armed struggle.
   A resolution calling for voluntary international coordination and
monitoring of boycotts against South Africa passed 136-4, with 14
abstentions by Western nations, Japan and Malawi.
   West Germany, Portugal, Britain and the United States opposed the
resolution, which calls for nations to adopt voluntary sanctions
against South Africa preventing trade in nuclear materials and
technology, oil and petroleum, credit and loans, air transport and
links, culture and sports, and military goods and services.
   The current voluntary oil embargo against South Africa would be
made mandatory by the Security Council, under a resolution that
passed 138-2, with 14 abstentions by Western Europe, Canada, Japan,
Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.
   Britain and the United States voted ``no,'' and have vetoed
attempts in previous years to make the embargo mandatory by using
their veto in the Security Council.

   Emperor Hirohito's condition stabilized Monday after
he weathered his most serious setback since falling ill more than
two months ago, palace officials said.
   The 87-year-old monarch's blood pressure plummeted to its lowest
level since Hirohito first coughed up blood Sept. 19, registering in
the low 40s early Monday, a senior palace official said.
   Palace doctors removed ``large amounts of blood'' caused by
internal hemorrhaging from Hirohito's stomach using a tube after
they noticed swelling of his abdomen, palace spokesman Kenji Maeda
told reporters.
   Doctors gave Hirohito emergency blood transfusions, and his blood
pressure recovered to 113 over 50 by Monday evening, Maeda said.
   Hirohito's condition ``is picking up ... as can be seen by his
blood pressure,'' Maeda said.
   His other vital signs had returned to near normal levels, and
``We've gotten past the worrying stage as far as the blood loss this
time is concerned,'' Maeda said.
   The frail emperor's setback Monday was the worst during his
current illness and the damage it inflicted is unclear, said the
palace official, who spoke on condition he remain unidentified.
   Doctors believe the world's longest-reigning living monarch is
bleeding mostly in the upper intestinal area where he underwent a
bypass operation in September 1987.

   Fair, mild weather continued Monday across much of the nation,
with freezing afternoon temperatures largely confined to the
northern Atlantic Coast region and the Rockies.
   Snow showers spread over northern Maine. During the previous
night, light snow fell across much of Vermont, with 4 inches
reported at Dorset and 3 inches at Ball Mountain.
   Temperatures in Vermont dipped close to zero during the night,
with a morning low of one degree above zero at Canaan.
   A low pressure system brought showers to the northern Pacific
Coast.
   Clouds and fog spread over much of the West during the morning,
with dense fog reported in California's central valleys.
   Temperatures were generally above 50 by early afternoon from the
high Plains through the lower half of the Mississippi Valley to the
southern Atlantic Coast, with readings in the 60s over southern
Texas and the Southeast, and in the 70s in southern and central
Florida, Texas' lower Rio Grande Valley and extreme southern
California and southern Arizona.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 13
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 81 at Thermal, Calif. Monday
morning's official low was 12 degrees below zero at Jackson, Wyo.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers were forecast across Washington

showers were forecast over northern Maine.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted across northern Maine; in the 30s
from Minnesota to eastern Montana, and across upstate New York and
northern New England; into the 40s from the northern Pacific Coast
inland, and through the Dakotas to the northern Atlantic Coast;
above 60 from the southern and central coast of California through
southern New Mexico and through the lower half of the Mississippi
Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast; and in the 70s over southern

   Richard M. Daley, bearer of the most recognizable
name in big-city politics and seasoned by an unsuccessful run five
years ago, announced Monday he will seek the mayor's office his
father occupied for 21 years.
   Daley's entry into the race expands the Democratic field to
seven, with an eighth, Mayor Eugene Sawyer, expected to announce
within a week that he also is a candidate.
   According to a recent poll, the 46-year-old Daley, who last month
overwhelmingly won a third term as Cook County state's attorney,
jumps into the race as the clear front-runner.
   Daley said he is not concerned by a crowded field.
   ``I don't need anyone in or out. If I stood here worrying bout
this scenario or that, or about odds, I would not be running as a
candidate for mayor of Chicago.
   ``I'm running,'' he told a packed news conference, ``and I'm
going to win.''
   Daley becomes the fourth white candidate in a city that made the
late Harold Washington its first black mayor in 1983 and has split
its vote along racial lines since.
   ``I'm not interested in running as the white candidate, or
serving as mayor for half the people,'' Daley said.
   ``Fighting crime is not a white issue or a black issue. Schools
is not a white or black issue. Protecting taxpayers is not a white
or black issue,'' he said.
   The Democratic primary, which has been the stepping stone to the
fifth floor office at City Hall for every Chicago mayor since 1931,
is scheduled for Feb. 28.
   The special election, set last month by the Illinois Supreme
Court to complete Washington's second term, follows on April 4.
   Richard J. Daley, who controlled a political army through
patronage jobs and earned the moniker ``Boss'' for his iron-fisted
grip on both local and national politics, served as Chicago's mayor
from 1955 until his death in 1976.
   The younger Daley, who served as a state legislator during part
of that time before moving to the prosecutor's post, made a first
attempt to fill his father's shoes in 1983.
   Daley split the white vote in that Democratic primary with
then-Mayor Jane Byrne, coming in third and catapulting Washington
into the mayor's chair.
   But in an almost complete reversal of events, Washington's death
last November has fractured the black voting bloc that was so
unified behind the former congressman.
   The City Council, in a tumultuous session after Washington's
death, appointed Sawyer as acting mayor to serve until the next
election. Neither Sawyer nor Alderman Tim Evans _ the other leading
black candidate _ appears able to muster the monolithic support that
made Washington the first mayor since the elder Daley to win
re-election.
   ``The mayor's office is not an heirloom to be passed on from one
generation to the next,'' Sawyer said Monday. ``Richard M. Daley's
announcement in no way changes my plans. I expect to win handily
against any opposition.''
   A Gallup poll in October, the most recent survey pitting
announced and expected Democrats against one another, found Daley
winning with 37 percent to 22 percent for Evans and 10 percent for
Sawyer.
   The other Democratic candidates are Aldermen Edward Burke,
Lawrence Bloom and Danny Davis, former Chicago Park District
Superintendent Edmund Kelly and former state Sen. James Taylor.
   City GOP leaders were still looking for a candidate to back,
though at least one Republican, Edward Howlett, announced on his own.

   A U.S. Air Force fighter bomber crashed
Monday while on a routine training mission, and Spanish military
officials said the pilot was killed and identified him as an Air
Force general.
   But an Air Force spokesman said he could not confirm the identity
of the pilot nor say whether the pilot survived the crash of the
F-16.
   Col. Juan Antonio Martinez Ortiz, Spanish Defense Ministry
spokesman, identified the pilot at Maj. Gen. W.S. Harpe, commander
of the 16th Air Force. He said Harpe was piloting the plane when it
crashed and that he was killed.
   Martinez said Harpe's body was found near the crash site.
   Sgt. Kenneth Fiddler, Air Force spokesman at Torrejon Air Base,
confirmed the crash and said the jet belongs to the 401st Tactical
Wing based at Torrejon outside Madrid.
   Fiddler said the jet crashed at about 6:45 p.m. near the town of
Chiloeches in Guadalajara province, 18 miles northeast of the base.
   He said however he could not immediately confirm the identity of
the pilot or say whether he ejected safely.
   According to an official U.S. Air Force biography, Winfield Scott
Harpe was born Jan. 12, 1937, in Thomaston, Ga.
   He began his initial flying duty in KC-135 mid-air refueling
aircraft at Beale Air Force Base, Calif., and trained on F-105
fighter aircraft.
   In 1966 and 1967 he was assigned to the U.S. Air Force 388th
Tactical Fighter Wing at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand
and flew 100 combat missions over North Vietnam.
   He was promoted to the rank of major general in July 1984.
   In October 1986 Harpe was named asstistant deputy chief of staff
for personnel for the U.S. Air Force in Washington and in July 1987
was named commander of the 16th Air Force at Torrejon.
   The United States and Spain signed an agreement in Madrid last
week that calls for the 401st Tactical Wing to leave Torrejon by
1990 and transfer to an air base in Crotone, Italy.

   Estonian activists indicated Monday they
will postpone confrontation with Moscow over running their own
affairs, in hopes time and negotiation will work in the Baltic
republic's favor.
   ``The finger was waved but the door was not slammed,'' when the
Kremlin nullified Estonia's declaration of sovereignty last month,
said Tonis Avikson, spokesman for the broad-based People's Front.
   Activists in Estonia said they have great hope for a new national
commission that is to define the powers of Moscow and the republics.
   Monday was opening day of a session of the legislature to
consider economic reforms and making the Estonian language official.
   After the legislature declared Nov. 16 that it had a right to
veto national laws, there were calls to cancel a federal statute
setting rules for demonstration permits. But Estonian deputies in
Tallinn, the Estonian capital, said Monday they were in no hurry to
veto anything.
   ``At present we are striving for our Presidium to fix the
procedure'' for ratifying Soviet laws or arranging a vote of the
legislature on them, said Edgar Savisaar, a leader of the People's
Front and a recently elected member of the legislature.
   Another deputy, Arno Almaniv, said a more liberal local law
automatically supersedes the national statute under Estonia's
proclamation of sovereignty.
   Members indicated they would compromise on demands for the
closure of Tallinn's most serious polluter, a paper mill under a
Moscow ministry's control, and were leaning toward a phased closing
over two years.
   A new mill built jointly with a Finnish company should be ready
in two years and is expected to replace the jobs and production lost
by closing the old one. It will use the latest low-pollution
technology and concentrate on making toilet paper, a chronically
scarce commodity in the Soviet Union.
   Conciliatory tactics, including repeated statements that
sovereignty does not mean independence, are critical to preventing a
repeat of the Czechoslovak experience 20 years ago, when a
Soviet-led invasion force crushed the liberal ``Prague spring,''
said Marju Lauristin, a People's Front leader.
   Responding to a reporter's question, she said such an event would
set Estonia back decades and endanger the reforms of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev that made the Estonian action possible.
   ``We cannot imagine perestroika going forward with tanks in
Estonia,'' she said.
   Estonia is pressing ahead with some elements of its autonomy
campaign and has formally proposed opening a consulate-type office
in Sweden, said Valle Feldman, spokesman for the Estonian Foreign
Ministry.
   The republic also is pursuing plans for economic sovereignty,
even though the Kremlin rejected Estonian ownership of all factories
and natural resources on its territory.
   Rein Otsason, head of the Estonian Planning Agency, said the
government is pursuing de facto economic control even if ``legal
ownership'' remains with national authorities.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush paid tribute to the
Special Olympics at a movie premier Monday night, and put in a word
of thanks to he-man actor Arnold Schwarzenegger for his efforts in
Bush's successful campaign.
   Schwarzenegger and diminutive actor Danny DeVito are the stars of
the new comedy film, ``Twins,'' in which they play an unlikely pair
of fraternal brothers separated at birth.
   The gala premier at the Kennedy Center benefited the Special
Olympics, launched two decades ago by Schwarzenegger's
mother-in-law, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of the late President
John F. Kennedy after whom the Kennedy Center is named.
   ``You know, there's all kinds of courage,'' Bush joked before a
packed audience at the Eisenhower Theater, where the movie was
shown. ``There's the courage of my friend Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
more than once campaigned with me across the country, then returned
home each time to face his in-laws.'' The actor's wife, television
journalist Maria Shriver, and her parents, Eunice and Sargeant
Shriver, joined in the laughter.
   Bush said Special Olympics, the athletic program created for
children and young adults with physical and mental handicaps, was a
``unmatched success.''
   ``Then there's the greatest courage of all, and that courage
ignores seemingly insurmountable obstacles, tries its level best,
works its hardest and emerges _ win, place or show _ always on top,
always a champion,'' he said.
   ``That's the courage of these Special Olympics kids, its
athletes, its families, and I salute them all.''
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, watched a demonstration of gymnastics
and weight-lifting by five Special Olympians in the foyer of the
Kennedy Center before the movie.
   DeVito also attended the premier, and he and Schwarzenegger wore
identical attire, from their wheat-colored silk blazers to their
gray slacks.
   The celebrities were joined by nearly two dozen past Olympic
medal winners and other competitors, including synchronized swimmers
and silver medalists Karen and Sarah Josephson as well as another
pair of twins, wrestlers Jim and Bill Scherr. Among the past
Olympians were swimmer Donna deVarona, hammer thrower Harold
Connolly, and runners Lee Evans and Charlie Greene.
   This was Bush's second movie premier in three days. On Saturday
night, he attended the opening of ``My Stepmother Is an Alien.''

   Soviet inspectors monitoring U.S. compliance
with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty watched Monday while the
first two out of 400 Pershing II missile motors were destroyed at an
Army facility east of here.
   Calm wind caused a 25-minute delay before the first solid-fuel
missile motor was ignited on the sagebrush-covered plains at 10:25
a.m., said Army spokeswoman Susan Voss at the Pueblo Depot Activity.
   The Colorado Department of Health permit that allows the rocket
motors to be destroyed here requires winds of at least 4 mph out of
the west to dissipate the rocket's exhaust plume and drive it away
from the city of Pueblo.
   Ten Soviet inspectors witnessed the first event along with 40
news reporters and 60 VIPs, Voss said.
   A total of nine missile motors are scheduled for destruction this
week and nine more next week in the first phase of the three-year
program.
   The Soviet team leader ``was very happy to see the treaty was in
effect. He was very pleased with the way the elimination was handled
and the way it went today,'' Voss said.
   She said the missile motor ``burned approximately 56 seconds and
completely eliminated the rocket motor's solid propellant.''
   The second missile motor was fired at 1:01 p.m. and burned for
60.6 seconds, an Army spokesman said.
   Voss said the Army also is doing air monitoring for hydrogen
chloride in compliance with the state permit.
   The Pershings were the delivery systems for European-based
nuclear warheads aimed at the Soviet Union. Under terms of the INF
treaty that took effect June 1, the United States has two years to
destroy 450 of the missiles _ each of which is propelled by two
rocket motors.
   In exchange, the Soviet Union will destroy a larger number of its
intermediate-range missiles as U.S. inspection teams look on.
   Pershing missiles have been destroyed at the Longhorn Army
Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas, since Sept 8. But this is the
first destruction under Soviet inspection to occur at the depot here.
   The Colorado Health Department, after a long environmental
review, gave the Army permission to conduct the burns for three
years. No more than six rockets can be burned per day.

   A man was sentenced Monday to a
suspended three-year prison term and placed on four years probation
for unlawful transportation of North American Indian and West Indian
artifacts he stole from museums.
   George B. McLaughlin, 48, of North Oxford, Mass., also was
ordered by U.S. District Judge Warren W. Eginton to continue mental
health treatment as a condition of his probation.
   Eginton fined McLaughlin $10,000 and ordered him to pay the
Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University and five other
museums from which he stole artifacts $5,490 in restitution and a
special $50 assessment.
   McLaughlin's attorney, M. Hatcher Norris, said his client was
unemployed and spent most of his time studying American Indian
artifacts.
   As part of a plea agreement with prosecutors, McLaughlin admitted
to stealing 13 artifacts from the Peabody Museum.
   McLaughlin also admitted to stealing thousands of artifacts in
1986 from five other New England museums: the Robbins Museum
(formerly the Bronson Museum) in Attleboro, Mass.; the Memorial Hall
Museum in Deerfield, Mass.; the Robert S. Peabody Foundation at
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.; the Springfield Science Museum
in Springfield, Mass.; and the Worcester Historical Museum in
Worcester, Mass.
   The stolen artifacts, valued at approximately $820,000, were
turned over to the FBI by McLaughlin or seized by the FBI during a
raid at his parents' home in Pittsburgh in February 1987,
authorities said.
   McLaughlin didn't sell the artifacts but kept them himself, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter S. Jongbloed said.
   He said McLaughlin cleaned and cataloged them, often removing
museums' catalog numbers and irreparably damaging many artifacts by
destroying their identification and history.
   McLaughlin pleaded guilty May 16 to unlawfully transporting
artifacts he stole from the Peabody Museum on Nov. 25, 1986.
   A tip from Peabody employees that artifacts were missing started
federal authorities on the investigation that led to the discovery
of the other thefts, Jongbloed said.
   He said McLaughlin cooperated with the FBI in returning the
artifacts to their owners.

   It was a scene from a peace activist's dream:
a Soviet military analyst held a report given him Monday by a U.S.
Army major and offered to send related material about the Soviet
Army to his American counterpart.
   ``That's great, because the more we can read, the better, and we
fear less,'' said Maj. Robert Butto, who had just given Alexander
Savelyev an American compilation of Soviet military terms.
   Savelyev, a nuclear disarmament researcher at the Institute of
World Economy and International Relations in Moscow, said he later
gave Butto a copy of his own analysis of Soviet strategic
communications.
   The two met as part of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders Summit,
a weeklong gathering of young Soviet and American leaders in 16
different fields.
   Other topics being discussed mostly in closed-door sessions
include government and political affairs, international trade, the
arts, education, global environment, social services and medicine.
   Savelyev said the military meetings were important because the
delegates had come to ``better understand, even purely on a personal
level, that we are the same people as you, that we don't want to go
to war, just as you don't.''
   U.S. delegates said the meeting was unique because low-level U.S.
and Soviet officers were seeking common ground in a manner that has
not occurred since World War II, when the Soviet Union and the
United States joined to fight Nazi Germany.
   ``After history has taken its course, the common purpose now, 40
years later, is to come back and perhaps see if we can find some new
common ground within the context of the way the world is today,''
said Scott Salmon, a Defense Department analyst.
   ``It's extraordinary that you're in the room with Soviet officers
conversing on a day-to-day basis.'' said Butto, a Pentagon analyst
of Soviet armed forces.
   The material Butto exchanged with Savelyev is publicly available,
but ``Just the fact of an ongoing dialogue with the (Soviet) armed
forces is an eye-opener,'' Butto said.
   The delegates agreed to set aside divisive issues such as
military strength in Europe, reductions in nuclear forces and
regional conflicts. Those issues, they said, are more likely to be
resolved in high-level negotiations.
   ``We are trying to find common concepts, common approaches to the
questions of mutual understanding,'' said Lt. Col. Anatoly F.
Shatalov, representing the Chief Political Department of the Soviet
Army and Navy. ``We are not counting tanks and cannons.''
   ``Just the fact that we have come together to discuss area of
concern to each of us is a step forward,'' said U.S. Navy Cmdr.
Michael Simpson.
   ``One area that we've discussed is why we perceive threats from
each others' military forces _ the way they're structured, the
strategy,'' Simpson said. ``And we've discussed what changes might
be made to make each other appear less threatening.''
   One threat discussed was the number of Soviet tanks in Eastern
Europe, said Simpson, who added, ``We've been able to express that
concern, and hear how the Soviets responded to it.'' But he declined
to go into detail.
   ``Our goal is really just to honestly and openly share our
perceptions and concerns with each other,'' Simpson said. ``There
will be great interest in what we discuss'' in the Pentagon.

   A former counter-terrorism adviser to the
Israeli government who died in a Mexico plane crash while traveling
under a phony name was a licensed arms dealer, an Israeli source
said Monday.
   Amiram Nir reputedly had acted as a go-between in the Iran-Contra
arms deal that shook the Reagan administration.
   The informed Israeli source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Nir was granted the arms license after he resigned from his
government post earlier this year.
   ``It was apparently a part of the (resignation) deal,'' the
source said.
   The source said it was not known whether Nir actually engaged in
arms sales, and quoted Nir as telling friends he wanted to focus on
``development projects.''
   Israeli officials and Nir's friends and former colleagues denied
that Nir had a weapons selling license.
   Nir advised two Israeli prime ministers on terrorism and was a
key figure in the Iran-Contra deal. In Mexico, the 38-year-old Nir
said he was an avocado exporter.
   Nir died in a plane crash Wednesday while flying from Uruapan,
about 200 miles west of Mexico City.
   In Mexico City, authorities arrested an Argentine who had
identified Nir's body, an Argentine Consulate source said Monday.
Pedro Curchet was arrested for working in Mexico while on a tourist
visa, and probably will be deported, the source said on condition of
anonymity.
   Avocado grower Carlos Garcia Mendez said Curchet had served as a
quality control expert for the Argentine partners in the avocado
exporting firm Eupasa, which has a packing plant in Uruapan. Garcia
Mendez is also a Eupasa partner.
   Investigators cast doubt on the claim that Nir was working as a
fruit salesman because of his past and because he used an assumed
name when renting the plane in which he crashed.
   ``Nir did not do much business on agricultural exports,'' the
Israeli source said. ``If this was the case, why did he have to rent
the plane under the name of Pat Weber?''
   Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber said he was
unaware of an arms sales license granted to Nir.
   Another Israeli official, who demanded anonymity, denied Nir had
a license. ``Nir was a good friend of mine,'' he said, ``and I know
he was involved in agricultural farms.''
   Nir's former colleague Ron Ben-Ishai, military commentator for
the Yediot Ahronot daily, wrote on Sunday that Nir ``was based in
London and with several European and Israeli businessmen imported
fruits and vegetables to Europe.''
   Ben-Ishai quoted Nir as telling him six months ago he ``had
enough'' of arms sales during the Iran-Contra affair.
   On Monday, Yediot quoted ``sources close to Nir's family'' as
denying the Washington Post report that quoted Nir as saying that
the counter-terrorist operations he supervised in 1985 and 1986 with
former White House aide Oliver North were authorized by a secret
U.S.-Israeli agreement.
   Nir was married to Judy Moses-Nir, the daughter of the first
editor of Yediot.
   On Sunday, the daily Maariv quoted North as saying Nir was ``a
real Israeli hero. He was an extraodinary courageous man, and he was
my friend.''
   The Post report was denied by Israel and the United States.
   But an Israeli expert on the Iran-Contra affair said Monday that
there were at least two covert operations, codenamed TH-1 and TH-2.
   Samuel Segev, author of a 340-page study titled ``The Iranian
Triangle'', said both operations involved organizing units of
mercenaries to free U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.
   His book says that under the TH-2 plan, a secret 43-man unit of
Lebanese Druze was created in 1986 to help free American hostages.
The plan was dropped when Nir told North there was only a 30 percent
chance of success.
   Segev, a columnist for the daily Maariv newspaper, told The
Associated Press his information was based on classified Israeli
government papers and interviews with key Israeli participants and
Iranian exiles.

<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Supreme Court justice refused Monday
to block the murder trial of a Christian Scientist couple accused of
killing their diabetic daughter by withholding medical care.
   William and Christine Hermanson, citing a state law that parents
following their faith may not be convicted of child abuse simply by
denying medical care, sought to block their prosecution on grounds
of religious freedom.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy denied the emergency request without
comment early Monday, the day the trial was due to begin.
   After Kennedy issued his ruling, Sarasota Circuit Judge Alan
Dakan granted a defense motion to delay the trial until Jan. 23 to
allow publicity about the case to die down.
   The Hermansons are charged with third-degree murder and child
abuse in the September 1986 death of their 7-year-old daughter, Amy.
   The couple denied her insulin injections because their religion
teaches reliance on prayer instead of medical treatment.
   Amy had been ill for eight days and her diabetes worsened before
an anonymous complaint alerted authorities. A court ordered medical
intervention, but the girl was dead when paramedics arrived at the
Hermansons' home.
   When a request to keep the case from being tried was turned down
by the Florida Supreme Court, the Hermansons filed a similar motion
before the nation's high court.
   The Florida law which exempts parents from child abuse charges
for denying medical care on religious grounds still allows the court
to order medical intervention if the child's health is at risk.
   Prosecutors tried to have the law declared unconstitutional. But
a circuit judge upheld the state law, allowing the Hermansons to use
the law as a defense.
   Assistant State Attorney Pat Whitaker said earlier this year that
while the law may provide some defense on the child abuse count, it
is irrelevant to the murder charge.
   The emotional nature of the case was noted by Dakan, who ruled
last month that certain statements in the court file may be sealed.
   ``The case may involve serious and controversial questions of
religious beliefs,'' Dakan said. ``Publication of such material
could seriously hinder ... the defendants' ability to obtain a fair
and impartial trial.''

   There weren't many people at Heritage USA
on Monday after a grand jury indicted PTL founder Jim Bakker, but
those who were there said the Christian spirit is down but not out
at the theme park.
   John and Frances Lambert of Renfrew, Ontario, have been staying
in the PTL trailer park for about three weeks.
   Lambert said he didn't know much about the charges against
Bakker, or the alleged conspiracy involving the contributions of
``lifetime partners,'' or major contributors.
   ``None of one of the ones I talked to were upset about it because
they said `Well, we give to God's work,' and they didn't expect to
get it back,'' Lambert said.
   ``Jim and Tammy spent too much money, I guess,'' he said. ``My
whole thing is, I hope they keep it (Heritage USA) going as a
Christian place.''
   The indictment alleges that Bakker and his top aide committed
fraud by misleading partners on the benefits they would get from
their contributions.
   Mrs. Lambert said there were fewer people on the grounds than
when they visited last year, but she didn't mind that.
   ``Because of it being slower, you get more of a chance to get out
and see things.''
   ``We're really enjoying our stay, and the friendliness of the
whole area,'' said Lambert.
   Bakker resigned from the ministry in March 1987 after he admitted
a sexual tryst with a former church secretary.
   After the ministry filed for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy law in June 1987, a trustee was appointed by the court to
oversee Heritage USA. Officials have said that visitors to the theme
park have declined since the scandal broke, and have laid off many
park employees as they struggle to keep PTL's finances afloat.
   Outside the Heritage Grand Hotel on Monday, only the splash of a
lighted fountain broke the stillness. Around the lobby of the hotel,
which has about one-third of its 490 rooms occupied, were lamp posts
spiraled with red ribbon like candy canes.
   Todd Loren, a bellman at the hotel, said he was a devoted
follower of Bakker at one time.
   ``I don't think that (the indictments) has an effect on
anybody,'' Loren said. ``It just means he gets his day in court.
That's the least he deserves.''
   As for the relative quiet of the scene Monday, he said: ``It's
been quiet for 18 months now.''
   Linda Masters of Charlotte, N.C., said she'd been visiting
Heritage for about four years and was saddened by its downfall.
   ``The crowd isn't here at all,'' Ms. Masters said. ``This place
was filled with the Holy Spirit, with God. The Holy Spirit is still
here, but it's terribly regretful what all has happened.
   ``I loved Jim and Tammy Bakker. My heart really aches for them,''
Ms. Masters said. ``They were given a vision here from God.''
   She said she still trusts the Bakkers despite the allegations
against them.
   ``I think he's forgiven. All men sin, and he's just a man.''

   Soviet officials mapping the agenda for
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's trip to New York said Monday that the Soviet
president wants to ``take as many bites as possible out of the Big
Apple.''
   Gorbachev arrives Tuesday, addresses the U.N. General Assembly
and meets President Reagan and President-elect George Bush on
Wednesday, and goes sightseeing Thursday. He leaves Friday for
Havana.
   Soviet officials were mum on the more tourist-oriented aspects of
the agenda, declining to say whether such visitor venues as Macy's
or the Statue of Liberty were on the itinerary.
   ``This will be a Christmas surprise,'' Andrei Grachev, senior
official in the Ideology Department of the Communist Party Central
Committee, told a news conference. ``It is common to keep such
preparations (secret) until the last moment.
   ``His route is still being worked out, but there is a natural
desire to take as many bites as possible out of the Big Apple,''
Grachev said.
   But New York police said the couple would visit the Observation
Deck of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan on Wednesday and
drive past the Stock Exchange and through the Broadway area. Opening
a Soviet export show, viewing European paintings at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and visiting Central Park were on the schedule
Thursday.
   Police said Mrs. Gorbachev might visit a Manhattan department
store Wednesday afternoon.
   But Soviet officials who last week said that Trump Tower _
considered New York's epitome of capitalist ostentation _ was on the
tentative schedule said Monday that it was not on the itinerary.
   Dan Klores, a spokesman for real etate developer Donald Trump,
said the visit to Trump Tower was no longer on the program and that
Trump and his wife, Ivana, instead would dine at the Soviet Mission
Thursday with other public figures.
   Soviet officials, bombarded by questions about the propriety of a
visit to to monuments to capitalism, appear to have been somewhat
embarrassed about the tentative itinerary for the world's most
powerful communist leader.
   But at a news conference Monday, Georgy Arbatov, director of the
Soviet Institute on the United States and Canada, told reporters:
   ``At Macy's or Bloomingdale's, or any other store, our
understanding is that they ask for your cash or credit card, and
that's all.
   ``No one asks about whether you belong to the (Communist) party,
or about your moral behavior.''
   Gorbachev's U.N. visit will be the first by a Soviet party leader
since former leader Nikita S. Khrushchev banged his shoe on a U.N.
desk in 1960 in the General Assembly.
   Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the United Nations in 1967.
At the time, he shared power with party leader Leonid Brezhnev.
   Vernon A. Walters, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said
U.S. authorities were aware of Gorbachev's schedule but that the
Soviet side wanted to release it later.
   Grachev said Gorbachev's U.N. visit and meeting with Reagan and
Bush ``will not disappoint the hopes and expectations for a better
and safer world that Americans and others outside this country have
placed on him.''
   U.N. observers said they expected Gorbachev's speech to be a tour
de force of Soviet diplomacy that could contain major surprises and
initiatives.
   Asked about the topics Gorbachev would raise, Grachev said: ``We
are 100 percent sure he won't be silent on the Middle East and a
settlement there.''
   The visit comes at a time when the United States has offended the
United Nations, Arab nations and many U.N. members by denying a visa
to Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat to address
the General Assembly.

<HEAD>Judge Awards $16 Million to Peggy Railey's Family</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with judge awarding damages, testimony from
`other woman.' No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Relatives of the comatose wife of a once prominent
ex-minster were awarded $16 million in damages from the husband
Monday after another woman testified that he and she had been
longtime lovers.
   Psychologist Lucy Papillon confirmed reports that she and Walker
Railey had been lovers for 10 months prior to the April 21, 1987,
attack on Peggy Railey and that Railey spent more than an hour at
her home that night.
   She insisted she knew nothing that could shed light on the
identity of the assailant who choked Mrs. Railey senseless and left
her for dead in the garage of the couple's fashionable home.
   State District Judge John Whittington concluded the day-long
civil trial by finding Railey liable to Mrs. Railey's family for
nearly $16 million, about evenly divided between actual and punitive
damages.
   Though no criminal charges have been brought, police have said
that Railey, the former senior minister of the First United
Methodist Church, is the only suspect. He denies attacking his wife.
   Bill Arnold, an attorney for Mrs. Railey's mother, Billie Jo
Nicolai, was asked whether he thought the family would ever receive
much money from Railey, who has said he has no money and no job.
   ``I don't know how much money he has or how much money he will
have in the future ... but I'm going to do my very best to see that
whatever it is goes to Peggy Railey's medical expenses,'' Arnold
said.
   Earlier Monday, a physician testified that Mrs. Railey, who is in
a Tyler nursing home and is given virtually no chance of regaining
consciousness, will require $4.3 million in medical treatment during
the next 30 years.
   Dr. Williams Parker, director of the Baylor Institute of
Rehabilitation, described Mrs. Railey, 40, as ``seriously
brain-injured'' and incapable of communication.
   Though he denies that he tried to kill his wife, Railey
technically admitted the charges contained in the civil documents by
refusing to respond to the lawsuit.
   Railey, known for his liberal views on civil rights, received
death threats in the weeks before his wife was attacked. Police
first thought they were from white supremacist groups, but the FBI
later traced them to a typewriter in the First United Methodist
Church office.
   Whittington ruled last spring that Railey ``intentionally,
knowingly, maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle his wife''
and cover up his actions with a ``false alibi.''
   He had told police he was involved in a research project at
Southern Methodist University at the time of the attack on his wife.
   Railey, 41, was not present Monday and is believed living in San
Francisco, but Mrs. Papillon, the ``other woman'' in the case,
testified as a reluctant witness.
   Unsmiling and composed, Ms. Papillon said she met Railey several
years ago but their affair did not begin until June 1986. She said
that in the months before the attack she and Railey would meet about
three times a week, mostly in her home.
   The night of the attack, she said, he visited her for about 75
minutes, leaving about 8:45 p.m. She said he called her about 11
p.m., saying he wanted to return to her house, but they decided it
was too late in the evening. Police believe that Mrs. Railey was
attacked sometime between 8:30 p.m. and 11 p.m.
   Ms. Papillon described her relationship with Railey as serious
and longterm and said they had discussed marriage. It was her first
public comment on the relationship, but she had testified about it
earlier before a grand jury and in a sworn deposition.
   An earlier witness projected Mrs. Railey's lost wages as a music
instructor at an exclusive Dallas girls school as $1.1 million over
the next 30 years.
   Witnesses have indicated Railey did not seem terribly upset about
the attack on his wife, and later abandoned her and their two young
children.

<HEAD>NATO Will Require Greater Soviet Bloc Cuts in Conventional Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

   NATO will demand that Warsaw Pact
nations make bigger reductions in their forces than the West when
the sides meet for talks on conventional arms, a U.S. negotiator
said Monday.
   ``It's really quite a forward-looking position,'' Paul Nitze,
special assistant to President Reagan on arms control issues, said
in a meeting with reporters.
   ``It would carry out the principle ... of unequal reductions on
the two sides in order to bring about an endpoint of equality,'' he
said. ``This would require ... substantially greater reductions'' on
the Warsaw Pact side.
   ``The exact figures of the tanks, armored personnel carriers,
bridging equipment'' and other forces ``still remain to be worked
out,'' Nitze said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and foreign ministers of the
other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are to confer
Thursday and Friday in Brussels about a joint position for
negotiations on reducing conventional arms in Europe.
   In a speech later, Nitze declared: ``There is opportunity for
great progress in reducing the level of East-West military
confrontation across the board. But complacency is unjustified. Much
hard work lies ahead if this potential is to be realized.''
   On conventional arms, he said: ``It would be imprudent to assume
that the huge imbalance between NATO and Warsaw Pact conventional
capabilities can be redressed solely through arms control
negotiations.
   ``One must also consider the fact that, given the record of past
efforts at conventional arms control, any relief from arms control
in this area is likely to come only several years in the future.''
   Negotiations on conventional arms by the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw
Pact nations are expected to begin early next year in Vienna,
Austria, under the name Conventional Stability Talks.
   NATO issued a report last month saying the Warsaw Pact has a huge
advantage in such weapons. It cited 51,500 main battle tanks for the
Warsaw Pact and 16,424 for NATO, along with 22,400 armored infantry
fighting vehicles for the East and 4,153 for the West.
   Nitze said progress has been made toward reducing long-range, or
strategic, nuclear weapons, ``but many hurdles must yet be crossed
before the finish line is reached and it is by no means a foregone
conclusion that they will be.''

<TEXT>
   Jiri Hajek, a human rights activist and
former Czechoslovak foreign minister, was allowed to leave his
country for the first time in 20 years on Monday for a visit to
Austria.
   Hajek, foreign minister during the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reform
period, was accompanied by his wife when he arrived in Vienna.
Czechoslovak authorities gave them 10-day travel permits.
   Hajek, asked by reporters in Vienna whether Czechoslovak
authorities were changing their attitude toward dissenters, said:
``I would not like to project my simple adventure into a broader
(political) context ... I don't want to make any speculation for the
time being.''
   He called the decision to allow him to visit Austria ``a very
pleasant surprise.
   ``I was invited in September and in the meantime things were
arranged'' between his Austrian hosts and the Czechoslovak
authorities, he said.
   Hajek, 75, was invited to lecture Wednesday at a peace research
institute in the southern city of Graz.
   Hajek's trip came as Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jaromir
Johanes held talks Monday with his Austrian counterpart, Alois Mock.
Johanes is on his first trip abroad since becoming foreign minister
in October.
   Mock and Johanes signed an agreement to exchange cultural
institutes in the two capitals. According to Austrian radio, it will
be the first such institute established in Prague by a Western
country.
   Hajek, a signatory of the Charter 77 human rights manifesto, was
ousted as foreign minister after the Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia that crushed the social and economic reforms of
Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek.
   In 1970, Hajek was expelled from the party, along with a
half-million other people. Hajek has been repeatedly harassed by
authorities and was recently detained along with more than 20 other
activists to prevent an independent symposium on Czechoslovak
history from taking place in Prague.
   Last month, Dubcek was permitted to travel to the West for the
first time since 1970 to receive an honorary degree in Italy.
   In his meeting with Johanes, Mock asked that Dubcek also be
granted permission to travel to Austria for a lecture. The
Czechoslovak foreign minister's reaction was not known.

   A California scientist who vanished more than 18
months ago, raising federal officials' fears because of his
knowledge of the top-secret research laboratory where he worked, was
arrested here Monday on federal charges.
   An FBI agent, who declined to give his name, confirmed the arrest
of chemist Ronald K. Stump but refused to give further information.
   Stump, who lived on a houseboat in the Sacramento River delta,
had worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
Livermore, Calif., for more than 25 years before he disappeared in
April 1987.
   Officials said he had access to the laboratory's top-secret
Tritium Facility and other national clearances. Tritium is a
radioactive form of hydrogen used in some forms of nuclear bombs.
   Stump told Lawrence Livermore officials he suspected that he had
cancer and asked for extended sick leave. However, the government
has charged Stump with fraud over his alleged role in the
laboratory's purchase of a $250,000 piece of equipment that
malfunctioned.
   He was sought by the FBI on a warrant charging him with unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution.
   Allegations that federal authorities failed to investigate
Stump's disappearance and other employee violations at Livermore and
other laboratories have prompted an investigation by a the House
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
   Livermore administrators were worried about protecting the lab's
public image and chose to let Stump go free rather than risk
unfavorable publicity, according to investigators on the lab's
security force and in Congress.

<HEAD>Aviation Council Weighs Iran Air Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. aviation agency on Monday put off a
decision on whether to condemn the United States for shooting down
an Iranian passenger jet.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization's governing council
met to discuss a report from its technical staff, which said the jet
only had 40 seconds to respond to a warning before it was blown up
by a U.S. warship.
   Assad Kotaite, the organization's president, said the group met
for three hours but came to no conclusions.
   He said the 33-nation governing council would hold further talks
Wednesday. But he said the group favors asking the organization's
Navigation Commission to make a recommendation on the report at the
governing council's next session in February.
   The Iran Air Airbus A-300 was shot down over the Persian Gulf by
the U.S. warship Vincennes on July 3. All 290 people on board were
killed.
   The report was made available Friday to the Canadian Press news
agency. According to CP, the report said U.S. warships in the
Persian Gulf had no way to hear radio transmissions between the Iran
Air flight and air traffic controllers.
   The Iranian delegation to the governing council's meeting called
for immediate condemnation of the United States. The country does
not have a vote on the council.
   ``This tragic incident has one very big technical aspect,''
spokesman Mahmood Hajighasemali said. But he added, ``The most
important aspects are the humanitarian and legal aspects.''
   Edmund Stohr, the U.S. delegate, declined comment.
   The report concluded that several warnings were issued to the jet
before the Vincennes downed it, but only one warning _ from another
U.S. vessel in the area _ was coded specifically for Iran Air Flight
655.
   The plane only had about 40 seconds to react to that warning
before it was shot down, the report said. It said the ``absence of a
clear method of addressing challenged civil aircraft'' in U.S. Navy
procedures probably contributed to the failure of the airliner crew
to heed radioed warnings.
   The Pentagon had no comment Monday. Its investigation found that
a series of events aboard the Vincennes led the ship's crew to
believe the Airbus was an attacking Iranian war plane.
   A total of 159 nations belong to the International Civil Aviation
Organization, headquartered in Montreal.

   Former church secretary turned Playboy model and
disc jockey Jessica Hahn said Monday that indicted PTL founder Jim
Bakker was playing for sympathy when he said he would kill himself
if it would help Christianity.
   Bakker and three former aides were indicted Monday on federal
charges of mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiring to defraud the
public.
   ``In March of 1984,'' she said, ``John Fletcher (a PTL colleague
of Bakker's) came to me and said, `Jessica, Jim Bakker told me to
tell you if it would save Christianity, he would blow his head off.'
He's used it on me, he's used it on the church, and now he's trying
to use it on you.''
   Ms. Hahn, speaking at a news conference, predicted that Bakker
would be convicted on the charges and said she would testify against
him in court.
   Ms. Hahn, who engaged in a sexual encounter with Bakker in a
Flordia motel room eight years ago, was paid $363,000 in hush money
but later gave most of the money back.
   She lived at one time in the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles and
wrote an article for Playboy about her affair with Bakker. The
article appeared with bare-breasted photos of the church worker
turned rock music video vamp.
   Earlier this year she began work as an announcer at KOY in
Phoenix.
   Ms. Hahn was one of those who testified before the grand jury
that returned the 24-count indictment. She said she knew about the
indictment a year ago and was told they would be handed up after the
November elections.
   Ms. Hahn disputed charges that she had brought down the PTL,
saying it would have happened without her.
   She told reporters her involvement with the story had cost her
her family.
   ``My mother and I have not talked, I have not seen my family, in
one year,'' she said, adding that she was hoping to finally put the
controversy behind her.
   ``This is where it ends for me,'' she said. ``I have lived with
this for eight years ... I refuse to be a slave to this any longer.''

   The leader of a military rebellion
surrendered Monday night, turning over command of an arsenal he and
about 500 followers used as a base during their uprising, according
to news reports.
   The government of President Raul Alfonsin had claimed victory
earlier Monday, saying the military rebellion was over. But the
public was skeptical because rebel leader Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin
and many of the renegades remained at the Villa Martelli arsenal.
   With the news that the last garrison now was in the hands of the
authorities, it appeared Alfonsin had quelled the third army mutiny
in 20 months and the most serious threat so far to his government.
   A military officer at Villa Martelli told reporters that
Seineldin turned over command of the unit to Gen. Isidro Caceres,
according to the private news agency Diarios y Noticias.
   The unidentified officer was quoted as saying that Seineldin
``placed himself at the disposal of the appropriate military judge''
and that he would be transferred Tuesday morning to a garrison to be
imprisoned.
   Shortly after, several army trucks left the arsenal carrying
cheering troops, according to the report. It was not immediately
known where the trucks were headed.
   The news agency quoted the officer as saying Seineldin assumed
``all responsibility for his actions'' during the four-day mutiny,
which began Thursday.
   Political opponents had claimed Alfonsin made a deal with the
rebel soldiers and demanded that he reveal the terms.
   An investigation began into a street battle between rebel
soldiers and demonstrators Sunday evening in which three people were
killed and 13 civilians and 12 policemen were injured, provincial
police reported.
   Patricio Echegaray, general secretary of the Communist Party,
said Monday: ``The people in the streets smell treason in the
(government's) claim to have squashed the rebels.
   ``I'm sure that, in the near future, as a result of the back-room
negotiations the government will try to impose an amnesty and bring
an end to the trials of (officers) who participated in the state
terrorism during the last dictatorship.''
   Echegaray's reference was to the military governments of 1976-83,
which conducted a so-called ``dirty war'' against leftists in which
an estimated 9,000 people disappeared.
   Alfonsin denies making a deal. Doubts stem from the fact that the
government did not immediately arrest and disarm the rebels, who
said publicly they negotiated a truce rather than surrendered.
   News reports said the mutineers handed over the infantry school
at the Campo de Mayo base, and the 6th mechanized infantry regiment
at Mercedes, only after being told to do so by Seineldin.
   Maj. Luis Albert Brun, who led the mutineers at the infantry
school, said he expected the rebels to be allowed to return to their
units without punishment.
   The government has not said whether it will prosecute the rebels.
   Earlier Monday, Seineldin helped dismantle barriers and retrieve
land mines at the Villa Martelli arsenal. The government news agency
Telam said he would be sent to a military prison in the interior.
   Rebel demands included an end to the prosecution of officers for
human rights abuses in 1976-83 dictatorship, a change in the
military hierarchy and better pay and equipment. The same demands
were behind similar uprisings in April 1987 and last January.
   It was clear this time that the rebels had wide support
throughout the army.
   Five bases openly supported the mutineers and units at several
others refused to help the government.
   In contrast to the current situation, soldiers who participated
in the April 1987 uprising were arrested, held incommunicado and
taken to military prison.
   Alfonsin also said after that revolt that the surrender was
unconditional. Soon afterward, however, three-fourths of the army's
top generals were removed and Alfonsin proposed legislation limiting
prosecution for human rights offenses only to the highest-ranking
officers.
   The street battle Sunday occurred when loyal troops within 100
yards of the rebel base at the Villa Martelli arsenal began pulling
back.
   Several hundred people who had demonstrated against the rebellion
surged forward, hurling rocks and firebombs at rebel vehicles. Rebel
soldiers opened fire.
   Police said two civilians and one policeman were killed. They
said earlier reports of a third civilian killed were wrong.
   Echegaray said the two civilians killed were members of the
Communist Party. He called them ``martyrs for democracy.''
   A bomb exploded Monday morning at an army building in downtown
Buenos Aires, but caused no casualties. A woman who telephoned the
news agency Noticias Argentinas claimed responsibility for a group
calling itself the Che Guevara Brigade and said the explosion was
``homage to the dead at Villa Martelli.''

   PTL founder Jim Bakker, forced to quit his
multimillion-dollar television ministry after admitting a sexual
encounter with a church secretary, was indicted Monday along with
three former aides on charges of fraud and tax evasion.
   A federal grand jury charged Bakker, 48, and former aide Richard
Dortch, 57, in a 24-count indictment with mail fraud, wire fraud and
conspiring to defraud the public through the sale of lifetime
partnerships in the ministry's Heritage Village theme park in Fort
Mill, S.C., south of Charlotte.
   If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison and
$250,000 fines on each count.
   Bakker's wife, Tammy, also a target of the grand jury, was not
indicted.
   A second, 11-count indictment charged David Taggart and his
brother, James, with tax evasion and conspiracy to impede the
Internal Revenue Service in the collection of taxes. David Taggart
is former PTL vice president and special assistant to Bakker; James
is a former interior designer for PTL.
   U.S. Attorney Thomas Ashcraft declined to comment or say whether
other indictments were possible. ``There has already been too much
publicity on this already and we don't want any more,'' he said.
   The defendants were ordered to appear in federal court Dec. 15.
   At Jim and Tammy Ministries, the Bakkers' new organization's
offices south of Charlotte, Bakker's attorneys Jim Toms and Ryan
Hovis said Bakker was trying to deal with the indictments and would
not have a statement for several days.
   ``Certainly there's a degree of discouragement or regret that
criminal charges were brought against Mr. Bakker,'' Toms said. ``But
he's glad to know what he's facing, so he can prepare his defense.''
   Hovis added, ``We've been fishing in a muddy pond up till now. It
looks now like the water's clearing up.''
   Dortch told reporters in Clearwater, Fla., where he runs a
ministry called Life Challenges, that he looked forward to being
able ``to tell my side of the story and to put this matter behind
me.'' He asked from prayers from ``all of my brothers and sisters in
the Christian community and in the religious community.''
   The Bakkers founded their ministry as Trinity Broadcasting in
1972. Through the show ``The PTL Club,'' which combined a talk-show
format with a folksy message of salvation, Bakker became one of the
country's most popular television evangelists and the head of a
multimillion-dollar organization.
   But he resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting money was
paid to buy the silence of former church secretary Jessica Hahn
about a 1980 sexual encounter in a Florida motel room. The payment
totaled $363,700 in ministry money.
   He admitted the tryst with Ms. Hahn but denied her charge that
she was an unwilling participant, as well as other charges that
quickly surfaced including financial mismanagement and homosexual
encounters.
   Bakker's Pentecostal denomination, the Assemblies of God,
dismissed him and Dortch in May 1987, and in June, PTL filed for
protection under federal bankruptcy laws.
   Ms. Hahn was one of the first witnesses called to testify before
the grand jury, which began work in August 1987. Former ministry
officials, PTL board members and PTL employees also testified behind
closed doors before the panel.
   Monday's indictment alleged Bakker and Dortch diverted PTL funds
for their own use. Bakker and his wife were given bonuses totaling
nearly $3.5 million and Dortch obtained bonuses totaling $550,000,
the indictment said.
   The indictment also accused Dortch of authorizing a payment of
$265,000 to Ms. Hahn, saying that he asked a contractor to supply
the funds. The contractor, Roe Messner, was instructed to get his
money back by overbilling PTL by the same amount by inflating
construction costs on a PTL project, the indictment said.
   Messner, who was PTL's chief builder under Bakker, was one of
several targets of the grand jury investigation. But he was not
charged in Monday's indictments.
   Ms. Hahn, who currently works for a radio station in Phoenix,
Ariz., said Monday that she had known that indictments were planned
for more than a year. She predicted that Bakker would be convicted.
   She told a news confrence that she is willing to testify in
court, but other than that wants nothing to do with the story.
``This is where it ends for me,'' she said. ``I have lived with this
for eight years. ... I refuse to be a slave to this any longer.''
   The indictment charged that in 1984, Bakker announced the sale of
lifetime memberships for the purpose of financing construction of a
large hotel at Heritage USA. More than 152,000 fully paid
partnerships were sold producing at least $158 million in revenue,
the indictment said.
   The indictment alleged that Bakker and Dortch made false
statements to induce people to buy partnerships and that the partner
funds weren't used to construct the lodging facilities that were
promised.
   At the same time, Bakker and Dortch were concealing the true
financial condition of PTL from the ministry's board of directors,
the indictment said.
   The Taggarts were accused of diverting $1.1 million in PTL funds
to pay personal bills and expenses while failing to report the funds
as income on their 1983 through 1987 tax returns.
   For those years, according to the indictment, David Taggart
evaded some $320,000 in taxes while James Taggart evaded taxes
amounting to some $175,000.
   While the grand jury met over the last 15 months, prosecutors
called dozens of witnesses and subpoenaed thousands of documents to
help them learn how the ministry under Bakker's leadership from 1980
to 1987.
   Some of the records indicate the grand jury focused on the lavish
lifestyles of the Bakkers and others. Records of travel and
entertainment expenses, credit card charges and advances were among
the thousands of documents subpoenaed.
   In a separate action, the Bakkers were ordered by a federal
bankruptcy judge last month to repay PTL $6.6 million as restitution
for excessive pay and benefits they received from the TV ministry
between 1984 and 1987. David Taggart was ordered to repay about $1.1
million.
   That ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds was the first
time any court had ruled that Bakker or any other PTL leaders had
used PTL donors' money improperly. Bakker's attorneys have said they
will appeal.
   Meanwhile, the fate of the ministry just across the South
Carolina border in tiny Fort Mill remains on hold.
   Since May, a variety of suitors _ including Bakker _ have tried
to buy the 1,700 acres of undeveloped property, the satellite
television network and Heritage USA theme park.
   Reynolds, who has overseen the bankruptcy proceedings, has
scheduled an auction Dec. 12, after earlier rejecting prior bids.
Proceeds will go to satisfy the ministry's debts, which could exceed
$130 million.
   At one time, Bakker claimed to have the financing to buy the
ministry back himself for $172 million. But the deal fell through
when Bakker was unable to secure a $3 million down payment.

   It was driving up to the Statehouse on
Monday that Patrick Kennedy, soon to be state Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
was struck by the awesomeness of it all.
   ``I guess it was when I drove up today and wondered whether I
should go in the legislative parking lot or just park out front,''
Kennedy said during a break in an all-day orientation for freshmen
legislators.
   At 21, the Providence College junior is the latest member of the
Kennedy clan to begin a political career. He won a bitterly fought
Democratic primary in September over a five-term incumbent and was
automatically elected from the west-side neighborhood because he
faced no Republican opposition.
   Kennedy, the son of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and nephew of
former President John F. Kennedy, knows his arrival in the House
will attract more than normal attention.
   ``There is a certain responsibility you're held accountable for,
not just as a representative from your district, but you're held
accountable for what my family's commitment to public service has
held for so many people,'' he said.
   The legacy of public service doesn't ease the nervousness felt by
freshman legislators.
   ``I was so nervous getting up today with the microphone. I'm
going to have to practice,'' Kennedy said. ``Even my father's still
nervous when he gets up to speak.''
   He says he plans to do his legislative homework early and get to
legislative leaders while they still are considering changes in
bills in which he has an interest.
   The social science major has trimmed down his class load so he
can handle his legislative duties. As for graduation: ``I'm in no
rush,'' he said.

   The memories of the Soviet surprise at
Reykjavik, Iceland, two years ago are still fresh in the minds of
U.S. officials as they prepare for Wednesday's meeting between
President Reagan, George Bush and Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   U.S. officials, by playing down expectations for the meeting and
claiming it is ``not a summit in the traditional sense,'' echo
similar assertions made two years ago prior to the so-called
``mini-summit'' held in Reykjavik.
   ``Everyone agrees that the most important reason for this meeting
is to review where the relationship between the two countries is, to
reflect on the historical strides that we have made in our
relationship,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after
the New York meeting was announced.
   But Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, Reagan's national security adviser,
said Friday that the U.S. side will be ready if Gorbachev springs
anything.

   The government claimed victory in
a four-day military revolt after hundreds of civilians pelted rebel
troops with rocks and bottles and the renegade leader surrendered.
Four people were reported killed.
   Despite the arrest of their leader, Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin,
the rebels refused to concede defeat Sunday after the melee at their
headquarters, the huge Campo de Mayo army base outside the capital.
   ``We don't use the word `surrender;' we use the term
`negotiation,''' said one of Seineldin's followers, Maj. Luis
Alberto Brun, in an interview with the independent news agency
Noticias Argentinas.
   President Raul Alfonsin insisted that no rebel demands had been
met in obtaining an end to the third such insurrection in 18 months.

   More uncertainty shrouds the policy that
President-elect George Bush will pursue in Central America than
perhaps any other foreign policy issue facing the new
administration, according to experts in and out of government.
   Bush has been sending mixed signals about his intentions, telling
an interviewer in October he ``absolutely'' would support a renewal
of military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras under certain conditions,
but leaving a different impression in more recent comments.
   No less a foe of Contra aid than House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, said after a post-election meeting with Bush that he is
``encouraged to believe that there is a search for a policy that
will be acceptable'' both to Bush and the Congress.
   As an example of Bush's seeming ambiguity on the issue, he said
in late November that he has worked ``long and hard'' for Contra aid
but is now ``perfectly willing to encourage the peace process'' if
it will lead to democracy in Nicaragua. He left unclear his position
on military aid to the rebels.

   Carlos Andres Perez, who led a wealthy
Venezuela during the oil boom of the 1970s, was re-elected president
after 10 years out of office on a promise to return his now
debt-ridden country to prosperity.
   Perez, of the governing Democratic Action Party, had campaigned
with almost messianic fervor on his ability to revive the economy of
this oil-producing nation despite a volatile oil market.
   The latest returns from Sunday's balloting showed Perez with 51.4
percent of the vote and Eduardo Fernandez of the Social Christian
Party with 38.6 percent. The rest of the vote was shared by 20 minor
party candidates.
   Perez, a charismatic figure popular with the working class,
favors tighter state control over the economy. Fernandez favors a
freer market.

   A simple dome-like structure used by Plains
Indians for ancient worship rites is the focus of a long-running
battle over religion and rehabilitation between tribal leaders and
Utah State Prison officials.
   Tribal officials are suing on behalf of six Indian inmates for
the right to build sweat lodges at the state's only maximum security
prison, 25 miles south of Salt Lake City.
   ``It's a form of worship and I think prison officials really
ought to be more cognizant of it as a rehabilitative tool,'' said
Travis Parashonts, a Paiute Indian who is director of the Utah
Office of Indian Affairs. ``It's a very uplifting and spiritual
experience.''
   But prison officials say the lodges represent a security risk,
and call the Indians' demand unreasonable.

   Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone stirred the ire of
U.S. minority groups in 1986 with a remark that Japanese were better
educated than Americans because Japan is a monoethnic society.
   Nakasone, who is no longer in office, later apologized to the
Americans, but his remark implicitly denied the existence of Japan's
own minority groups _ chiefly, the outcast Burakumin, the indigenous
Ainus and ethnic Koreans.
   Human rights activists claim those groups along with some
foreigners living in Japan are victimized by social attitudes and
practices that discriminate against people outside the mainstream of
society.
   The activists hope to raise an awareness among 122 million
Japanese of the plight of Japan's own minorities with meetings and
rallies in conjunction with the 40th anniversary Dec. 10 of the
United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.
   A U.S. State Department report said in February that Burakumin,
Ainus and Koreans all face ``entrenched social prejudice.''
   ``Although the Japanese are receptive to foreign ideas,'' the
report added, ``the citizens of this densely populated nation have a
cultural, ethnic and racial homogeneity which makes them less
willing to integrate alien residents ... into their society.''
   ``The Japanese majority just doesn't pay attention to these
issues,'' says Futaba Igarashi, secretary-general of the Democratic
Lawyers of Japan Association.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE BURAKUMIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   These are descendants of feudal-era outcasts in so-called unclean
professions such as hide-tanning and butchering. Centuries ago, they
were designated to live as outcasts in separate villages, or
``buraku.'' Prejudice against them was so strong that when maps were
drawn, the buraku were left out.
   Although their outcast status was abolished by the government in
1871, there are still 6,000 Burakumin communities in Japan,
according to the Burakumin Liberation Research Institute, which puts
their population at 3 million _ 2.5 times the government's official
figure.
   Racially identical to other Japanese, the Burakumin are still
perceived to be different.
   The unemployment rate for Burakumin is about 10 times higher than
the general population's rate of 2.6 percent, and they face social
discrimination, in part due to Japan's detailed family registration
system. The system enables companies to check the background of a
potential employee, or a family to check the suitability of a
possible spouse.

<HEAD>THE AINU</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Like American Indians, the Ainu are an ethnic and racial minority
indigenous to Japan, although most Ainu _ estimates of their numbers
range from 57,000 to 100,000 _ live and speak as Japanese.
   The Ainu have presented demands for self-determination at two
United Nations conferences, protesting ``wide social and economic
gaps between the Ainu people and other Japanese people.''
   ``Acts of discrimination against the Ainu people, due to their
ethnic origin, continue to persist in schools, places of employment,
marriages and other aspects of social life,'' said a statement
presented to the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
   In its report to the commission last year, the Japanese
government acknowledged for the first time that the Ainus possess a
distinctive religion, language and culture, but it maintained that
they enjoy equal protection under the law.
   According to Ainu Association officials, job discrimination is
common. Only 8.1 percent of Ainu attend university, compared with
27.4 percent of all Japanese.

<HEAD>THE KOREANS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At least 670,000 Koreans live in Japan, many of them descendants
of laborers forcibly brought to this country during Japan's
colonization of the Korean peninsula, 1910-45.
   Koreans say they continue to face discrimination. Most do not use
their real names, instead using Japanese names to conceal their
identity.
   Non-naturalized Koreans, including 587,000 first-, second- and
third-generation permanent residents, are considered foreign aliens
and are required to carry identification cards.
   Other Koreans have taken Japanese nationality, a complicated
process that requires them to officially relinquish their Korean
names and identity.
   ``Korean students have only half the chance of going into
university as majority Japanese,'' said a report by the London-based
Minority Rights Group. ``Since higher education ... is the key to
economic advancement, this is a serious drawback to Korean
aspirations.''

<HEAD>THE FOREIGNERS</HEAD>

   The Civil Liberties Union has approached the United Nations on
behalf of foreign workers _ many of them young women lured to Japan
with a promise of jobs as ``entertainers,'' only to have their
passports confiscated by their employers and to be forced into
prostitution.
   Of the 11,307 foreigners deported for working illegally in Japan
in 1987, 62 percent, or 7,010, were women. Ninety-three percent
worked as prostitutes, strippers or ``hostesses,'' according to a
group set up to assist foreign women.
   In recent years, thousands of South and Southeast Asian men have
come to work in Japan as laborers at construction sites and in
factories.
   Foreigners working in Japan have nowhere to turn for protection,
says lawyer Yaeko Takeoka.
   ``Their managers withhold their salaries, but since they are
working illegally, the government says they are criminals and don't
have any rights.''

   Nurettin Aytun was a high school student
when he was arrested in 1981. Today, at age 25, he is still in
prison, awaiting a military court's verdict in his trial on charges
of terrorist killings and bombings.
   ``My son was held incommunicado for almost two months at the
police station and then he got transferred to a military prison
where he spent five years in a cell,'' says his mother, Leyla.
   Aytun is one of the 737 defendants on trial in Ankara for
allegedly belonging to the leftist organization Dev-Yol
(Revolutionary Road).
   Most of the defendants were released over the past two years on
their own recognizance. But 64 defendants remain in prison. They
face the possibility of execution if the verdict is guilty.
   Halit Celenk, one of the lawyers for the Dev-Yol defendants, said
the verdict may come next year but the appeals process could stretch
the case into the next century. And it's possible that Aytun and
other defendants will remain behind bars all that time.
   ``Justice so late is no justice,'' says Celenk.
   In Turkey, there is no limit on the time a person may be kept in
jail after arrest. In some cases, defendants have been sentenced to
terms shorter than time they had already spent waiting for the end
of the trial.
   Attorney Ercan Kanar calls long trials unjust for those who are
eventually acquitted.
   For example, Haluk Tosun, a university professor, spent more than
three years in jail waiting for the start of his trial, at the end
of which he was acquitted.
   Ersan Sansal, another lawyer, said the courts do not follow any
objective standards in releasing defendants on bail.
   ``The decisions are taken subjectively by the judges. It is not a
fair practice.''
   A wave of political terrorism, pitting members of a dozen
militant leftist groups against extreme rightists, claimed 5,000
lives in Turkey at the end of last decade.
   The turmoil triggered a military takeover in 1980. About 30,000
leftist and rightist terrorist suspects were jailed following a
martial law crackdown on extremist groups.
   Since then, thousands have been released and dozens of trials
have been concluded. But some of the largest mass trials continue.
   According to statistics compiled by Turkey's Human Rights
Association, an independent group, 1,392 terrorist suspects are in
prison and still on trial and 2,209 are serving sentences.
   Of these, 227 are on death row but the Parliament held back
approval of carrying out the executions. In Turkey, executions are
carried out only after a lengthy legal process which includes
parliamentary ratification and confirmation by the president.
   One of the largest mass trials involves 1,243 defendants, all
accused members of the Dev-Sol organization. In the trial, being
held in Istanbul since 1982, the court has heard testimony from
2,000 witnesses. Two months ago defendants finished reading a
3,000-page defense plea. Next, some 200 lawyers will take the floor
to sum up the defense.
   In the Dev-Yol trial, Celenk said, judges were changed three
times in the past six years, slowing down the case as the newly
appointed judges took time to study earlier proceedings.
   Speeding up mass trials may not serve the cause of justice,
however, says lawyer Haluk Turkmen.
   The mass trial of 241 suspected Dev-Yol members in the eastern
city of Erzincan was finished in 15 months.
   ``There is an easy explanation for the speed of this trial,''
said Turkmen. Defendants were given 15 minutes each for a defense
plea. Lawyers protesting the restriction refused to speak.
   Lawyers also complain that it takes the lower courts months,
sometimes years, to send their opinions to appeals court for study.

   Today is Sunday, Dec. 11, the 346th day of 1988. There are 20
days left in the year. Hanukkah, the Jewish Feast of Lights,
concludes at sunset.
   Today's highlight in history:
   In 1936, Britain's King Edward VIII abdicated in order to marry
American divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson. In a radio address,
Edward said he ``would have found it impossible'' to carry out his
duties as king ``without the help and support of the woman I love.''
   On this date:
   In 1719, the first recorded sighting of the aurora borealis took
place in New England.
   In 1792, France's King Louis XVI went on trial, accused of
treason. (Convicted and condemned, he was sent to the guillotine the
following January.)
   In 1816, Indiana became the 19th state.
   In 1872, the first black U.S. governor took office as Pinckney
Benton Stewart Pinchback became acting governor of Louisiana.
   In 1882, Boston's Bijou Theatre, the first American playhouse to
be lighted exclusively by electricity, gave its first performance,
of Gilbert and Sullivan's ``Iolanthe.''
   In 1928, police in Buenos Aires thwarted an attempt on the life
of President-elect Herbert Hoover.
   In 1937, Italy withdrew from the League of Nations.
   In 1941, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States.
   In 1946, UNICEF was established.
   In 1961, a U.S. aircraft carrier carrying Army helicopters
arrived in Saigon _ the first direct American military support for
South Vietnam's battle against Communist guerrillas.
   In 1981, the U.N. Security Council chose Javier Perez de Cuellar
of Peru to be the fifth secretary-general of the world body.
   In 1985, General Electric agreed to acquire the RCA Corp. and its
subsidiary, NBC.
   In 1986, the South African government drastically expanded its
6-month-old media restrictions by imposing prior censorship and
banning coverage of a wide range of peaceful anti-apartheid protests.
   Ten years ago: Six masked men bound and gagged ten employees at a
Lufthansa cargo area at New York's Kennedy International Airport and
made off with $5.8 million in cash and jewelry, only a fraction of

<HEAD>Is America Really in Decline?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Because many political and business leaders say
it is so, and renowned academics provide a theoretical base for so
believing, a sense of industrial decline pervades American thinking.
   If, by chance, it is forgotten, reports on the trade deficit,
budget deficits, weak savings, low growth in gross national product
and apparent weakness in exports restore it to the public
consciousness.
   It is imbedded now, part of the national psyche, and reflected in
a morbid sense of inevitable decline comparable to what overtook
economic empires in the past. It contrasts sharply with the old self
view of America as No. 1.
   And it might not be justified.
   Professor Richard McKenzie of Clemson University believes there
is evidence in the past few years to question whether the thesis is
America's fate and, instead, to wonder if it might be a fiction of
well-intended but incomplete research.
   Among his reasons for so believing is that much of the scholarly
research that led to such assumptions were based on data for the
1960s and 1970s, and that when such data are updated to the
mid-1980s another story emerges.
   After updating, says McKenzie, the data ``no longer confirm (at
least, with the same force ) popular and scholarly visions of
relative decline.'' In short, many things have changed in the 1980s.
   For example, McKenzie says U.S. gross national product in
relation to GNP for the rest of the world did indeed decline from 43
percent in 1960 to 33 percent in 1975. But it has stabilized since
then.
   A similar pattern shows up in comparisons of American GNP with
the GNPs of major developed countries, he says.
   In proposing that many fellow academics have made incorrect
assumptions, McKenzie is challenging some of the brightest academic
writers of popular economic tomes, including Harvard professors
Robert Reich and Paul Kennedy.
   Kennedy, a Harvard historian who remains on some best-seller
lists with ``The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' says the
United States must learn how to manage its affairs so that erosion
takes place slowly and smoothly.
   In short, an assumption is made that the country is caught in the
jaws of an unrelenting historical force, and that if it cannot
escape it can at least try to slow the inevitable and attempt to
make the descent tolerable.
   As an example of his thinking, McKenzie challenges the popular
argument that the mounting international trade deficit is prima
facie evidence of lost competitiveness, lost drive and a declining
standing in the world economy.
   In a paper published by Washington University's Center for the
Study of American Business, the professor states that one reason for
the big trade deficit is faster U.S. economic growth compared to
many other nations.
   ``With more rapid growth, producers need more resources, many of
which must be drawn from abroad in the form of imports,'' he states.
``In turn, fewer domestic resources are available for the production
of goods for export.''
   The decline in real U.S. exports in the 1980s, therefore,
probably reflects a significant rise in domestic consumption,
McKenzie says.
   Again, while pessimists complain that the country is being sold
to foreign interests, McKenzie compares the situation to the huge
foreign investment in U.S. railroads in the 1880s, which was the
foundation of the American empire.
   He contends that the correct way to view such foreign investments
is the same way we view exports of goods and services: They are
``products'' produced by the economy that are attractive to
foreigners.
   While recognizing that scholarly research has gone into many of
the gloom and doom theses and that America does have serious
economic problems, McKenzie suggests that some extrapolations may be
premature and perhaps misdirected.
   ``Predictions of impending economic calamities are a mainstay of
American life,'' he concludes. ``They attract a great deal of
attention, sell a lot of books, and give life to political movements
for dramatic changes in policies.''

   Actress Phyllis Newman expected to make just a
quick trip home to New York for the holidays, but now it's an
indefinite waiting period until CBS decides what to do with ``Coming
of Age.''
   CBS pulled the comedy series because of poor ratings and is
looking for a new time slot.
   ``Kate & Allie'' returns next Monday to take over the 8:30 p.m.
EST time period. Meanwhile, ``Coming of Age'' has several episodes
in the can and CBS has ordered new scripts written.
   In the series, Newman plays the wife of an airline pilot (Paul
Dooley) who reluctantly retires because of a mandatory age limit and
finds it difficult to adjust to life in a retirement community. Alan
Young and Glynnis Johns play retired neighbors whose incredible
happiness drives Dooley to distraction.
   The New York actress, who's married to author and lyricist Adolph
Green, is a Broadway veteran and was in fact doing ``Broadway
Bound'' when the producers of ``Coming of Age'' asked her to come to
Los Angeles. She won a Tony award in 1962 for her supporting role as
the beauty queen in ``Subways Are for Sleeping.'' She was also
nominated for ``Broadway Bound.''
   She played Aunt Blanche in the Neil Simon play, then began a
brief role in the ABC soap opera ``One Life To Live.''
   ``I was supposed to do just five episodes of `One Life To
Live,''' she said. ``I played Renee Devine, an ex-madame from Las
Vegas who dressed to kill. The character just took off, and the
producer wanted me to sign a contract. I didn't want to commit
myself, so they kept having me come back.
   ``Then I was asked to come out and read for this show. A lot of
other women were reading for it. I had to read for everybody. The
producers, Universal, CBS. Then back to New York, and I didn't have
the part. When I didn't hear, I didn't think I had it. Then I was
called back to read with Paul Dooley.''
   She was finally signed, of course, and some shows were filmed for
a spring tryout. During the long writers strike, she packed up and
went back to New York. She talked about the show in Los Angeles just
before CBS put it on hold.
   Newman considers ``Coming of Age'' her first series, although she
previously starred in two other shows. She says ``Diagnosis:
Unknown'' doesn't count because it was only a brief summer show in
1960, and neither does ``That Was The Week That Was'' in 1964-65
because NBC pre-empted it so many times.
   She tells about it all in her biography, ``Just in Time,''
published recently by Simon & Schuster.
   ``I started writing it after I was diagnosed as having breast
cancer,'' she said. ``I started writing it because I didn't want to
talk about it. Not that it was a secret. After I had 50 pages down,
Simon & Schuster bought it.
   ``It tells the high points and low points of my life and how I
came through them. Now I'm 55 and I have my health. Betty Ford was
an example for me in talking about my illness. I'm getting some very
terrific letters from women about it.''
   Newman underwent one mastectomy and then had to have her second
breast removed. She describes it as ``no way to treat a lady.'' Soon
after her recovery she went back to work, first in a own one-woman
show, ``The Madwoman of Central Park West,'' then in ``Broadway
Bound.''
   Newman and her husband have two children, Adam, a comedy writer,
and Amanda, an actress.

<HEAD>West Germans Becoming Impatient with Foreign Military Presence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germans are showing sharp
impatience with foreign NATO troops on their soil as their
perception grows of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Soviet Union as a nation
of peace.
   The top U.S. military commander in Europe calls it ``wishful
thinking.''
   On Nov. 22, a British armored unit scrapped plans to enter a
northern town during maneuvers because the townspeople were fed up
with the noise and property damage created by war games.
   Three months earlier, a court blocked U.S. Army plans to station
36 helicopters outside Wiesbaden. The ruling came amid intense local
opposition to the noise caused by American aircraft and forces
already in the area.
   American troops and other forces of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization have been guarding this frontline nation since the end
of World War II.
   In maneuvers designed to keep the alliance's forces at peak
readiness, NATO tanks rumble across West German farms and as jet
aircraft swoop in on low passes.
   But West German politicians say they are facing what has become a
widespread public perception that Gorbachev, the Soviet president,
is a messenger of peace, and an accompanying attitude that perhaps
the hair-trigger military readiness and the resulting inconveniences
can finally be lessened.
   ``There is a deep-seated longing for peace. People find the idea
of lowering the military posture very attractive,'' Peter Petersen,
a federal lawmaker in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union, told The Associated Press.
   Petersen says West Germany is a committed NATO partner and that
Kohl's government sees the foreign troops in his country as still
necessary for the security of Western Europe.
   But Petersen adds that domestic political pressure for a serious
reduction in low-level NATO jet flights, fewer maneuvers that damage
property, and other demands cannot be ignored.
   Karsten Voigt, a lawmaker with the left-leaning opposition Social
Democrats, agreed.
   ``It is increasingly difficult for politicians of all political
colors to defend defensive needs against regional and national
pressures,'' Voigt said at the Nov. 13-18 Hamburg congress of the
North Atlantic Assembly, an independent body of lawmakers from the
16 NATO nations.
   The Social Democrats have taken a harder stance than the
Christian Democrats, maintaining that NATO's overall defense
strategy is outdated and needs to be reworked.
   U.S. military officials and conservative American politicians in
recent months have been aggressively trying to counteract West
European perceptions of Gorbachev as a peacemaker.
   ``We must not get a distorted idea of what is really happening,''
Gen. John Galvin, supreme Allied commander in Europe, recently told
reporters. ``Wishful thinking is causing the West to get deeper into
a situation in which support for deterrence may be seriously
threatened.''
   A new West German unease about foreign troops on their soil has
become especially apparent during the debate in NATO over
``burden-sharing.''
   U.S. officials charge that Western Europe is not shouldering its
fair share of NATO's financial burden and are asking West Germany
and other countries to spend more for defense.
   The accusation is a sensitive one in West Germany, where about
400,000 foreign NATO troops, including 250,000 Americans, are based.
   Kohl himself has suggested that his countrymen already endure
enough inconvenience because of NATO troops on their soil.
   Kohl and other West German officials suggest the United States
should not be looking just at dollars and cents when weighing each
NATO nation's contribution to the alliance.
   The West Germans say other factors should be assessed as well,
such as foreign tanks tearing up farmland and fears among the
population caused by low-level flights by military jets.
   ``There are 5,000 military exercises in this densely populated
country each year,'' said Petersen, the Christian Democrat lawmaker.
   ``There's no piece of real estate where you have a greater
concentration of soldiers and weapons _ including nuclear weapons.
   ``The Americans should understand these burdens. We want them to
stay here, but they must realize this is a political burden.''
   West German unease about foreign troops has increased this year
amid a rash of NATO jet crashes, and the fiery air show disaster
Aug. 28 at the U.S. Air Force Base in Ramstein.
   Thomas Enders, a political scientist at the German Society for
Foreign Politics, said a recent survey indicated that about 80
percent of West Germans backs NATO, but he added that a ``resurgence
of neutralism'' within West Germany could grow with Gorbachev in
power in the Soviet Union.
   An poll this past summer indicated that 71 percent of West
Germans had a favorable opinion of Gorbachev, compared with only 41
percent for President Reagan.
   But Kohl's government assures its transatlantic allies that it is
not convinced the threat from the East has vanished, and that West
Germany is committed to keeping NATO strong.
   Said Petersen: ``We're right next door to East Germany, so we
know full well why that is important.''

<HEAD>Beware Holiday Season Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While millions of children look forward to a
jolly old elf coming down the chimney at this time of year, there's
another group that likes to visit the homes of strangers: burglars.
   Police report that only the summer vacation season outdoes the
Christmas-New Year holidays for burglaries. Other crimes also
increase as pickpockets and thieves prey on travelers and shoppers.
   Being away from home for a holiday trip, or just to visit friends
for a few hours, can be an invitation to burglars. One way to
discourage them is to make the house look like someone is home, say
officials of ADT Security Systems.
   Leave lights on in several rooms, for example. And if you will be
gone for a while, attach timers to the lights to turn them on and
off at varying intervals.
   Leaving a radio playing, tuned to an all-talk station, can also
help, by making it sound like people are inside.
   And leave drapes and shades in their normal household pattern,
ADT officials say.
   Before leaving, turn down the volume of the telephone bells.
Constant ringing advertises absence to someone outside.
   If going away for an extended trip, ADT says, leave a car parked
in the driveway and make arrangements to have someone shovel the
snow if that is needed. Also, cancel all deliveries _ such as milk
and newspapers _ and have a friend collect your mail and put out
some trash at your home on garbage collection day.
   The Chubb Group of Insurance Companies reports that many claims
in this season involve small pilferage. Officials there urge putting
small valuables out of sight when having parties. Doing so before
caterers arrive can be a good idea.
   Fire claims also jump at Christmas, the company says, reiterating
the reminder to make sure the Christmas tree is watered and that the
lights are not left on. This may be a good time to check the battery
in the smoke detector.
   Whether traveling or shopping, never leave visible gifts in an
unattended car. Bring them into the motel room with you. At a
shopping center at least lock parcels in the trunk.
   While traveling, remain constantly wary, say security officials
of the American Express Company.
   Thieves operating at airports, train stations and other crowded
areas usually operate in groups of two to four, they report. One
crook seeks to distract the victim while an accomplice steals a
wallet, purse or baggage.
   Ploys can include a seemingly spilled purse, a handful of dropped
coins or other maneuvers.
   In some areas pickpockets have even been known to put up signs
saying ``Beware of pickpockets.'' Then, they watch people to see
which pocket they pat after noticing the sign. That way the crook
knows where the valuables are on the potential victim.
   Never leave baggage unattended, American Express says, because
many thefts are simply crimes of opportunity when someone puts their
luggage down to buy a newspaper or other item. Baggage carts should
be pushed ahead, where they can be seen, not pulled along behind and
out of sight.
   Men should not carry their wallet in a back pocket, it is among
the easiest to steal from. And women should carry handbags with the
flap turned toward the body and carried against the hip or in front
where it can be seen. The handbag should never be allowed to slide
to the back, where it is out of her sight.
   Dressing down can help too, to avoid attracting the attention of
crooks looking for affluent victims. And don't carry all valuables
together.

   Director Cres Van Keulen, whose office is in San Francisco, says
there are some 500 formal, local programs placing offenders in
community service jobs, averaging about 1,000 new cases a year.
   She adds that there could be another 1,000 informally structured
operations handling additional placements.
   If her estimates are right, more than a half-million offenders a
year are sentenced to community service time.
   Dr. Alan Harland, professor of criminal justice at Temple
University, says preliminary results of a study he's conducting
indicate that more than 80 percent of those working off community
service sentences complete their work.
   Ms. Van Keulen cited a California study that provides only a
glimpse of the financial savings in cases where community service
replaces imprisonment.
   Sixty-three California programs reported in 1987 that 103,000
offenders worked more than 6.3 million unpaid hours, a saving of $21
million to volunteer organizations and government agencies if they
had paid the minimum hourly wage of $3.35.
   Another study by the Public Agenda Foundation in New York City
indicates that the public accepts community service.
   Observations by 125 people who participated in 10 small-group
discussions said they favored alternatives to imprisonment if an
offender would ``face the implications of his crime and undertake
work that could prove useful.''
   One unscientific sign of success comes from program participants.
Petty thieves and white-collar criminals alike spoke favorably of
the experience.
   Sterling Hall, who says he was convicted three dozen times for
shoplifting (a claim borne out by the Vera Institute's records),
claims his second community service tour of 70 hours helped him
develop ``good work habits.''
   ``It has shown me teamwork,'' he says. ``It gave me personal
self-worth. It got me getting up in the morning. It gets you used to
taking orders.
   ``It saves the city quite a bit of money. It's more logical than
having the city send a person to jail, where they have to take care
of him and feed him.''
   But Hall wouldn't guarantee that he would go straight. ``I will
probably have the same problems as before,'' he says. ``You need
money to pay rent.''
   Young, the man convicted of stealing the Lone Ranger's pistols,
says he hopes his work at the stables will free officers to
concentrate on patrolling the streets.
   ``Community service gives you time to re-evaluate your life and
think about what's important,'' he says. ``A lot of people take
freedom for granted. It makes you see what the value of freedom is.''
   Zaccaro, now 24, says he began to pay back society with community
service time even before his sentencing last spring, when he
volunteered at Covenant House, a shelter for runaways in New York
City.
   ``I went to work in their van, traveling to the worst
neighborhoods in New York, talking to prostitutes and drug users,''
he says. ``We gave them sandwiches and tried to get them on the
right track. I saw the worst that any city has to offer.''
   At the King Street youth program, Zaccaro was closest to the
teen-agers, and counseled them against the use of drugs.
   ``You get out of it what you put in,'' he says, recalling his
60-hour work weeks. ``King Street would not be able to run without
volunteers like myself.''
   Frances Ellen, who served three months in prison and 1,500 hours
community service for income tax and securities violations, spent
her time designing and leading support groups for other offenders.
   ``It's sort of like having a major heart attack,'' she says.
``How do you restore yourself? We showed them how to deal with
guilt, shame, embarrassment, the sense of self-esteem that had been
destroyed'' _ all emotions she personally experienced.
   Ms. Ellen, of Los Angeles, was co-owner of an investment firm.
She says she and her partner were responsible for mismanagement that
cost their customers $13 million.
   ``Community service made me come out of myself and to look at the
consequences of my action on other people,'' she says.
   Although her community service time is over, Ms. Ellen continues
to volunteer her time with Foundation For People, the community
service group for which she established the group sessions.
   Also working for pay as a business consultant, Ms. Ellen says she
never misses a chance to lecture employers on business ethics. And
she has established a plan to pay some $5 million back to those who
lost money with her now-bankrupt firm.
   She says: ``Now, my life is about contributions to the society I
damaged.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Everybody knows the ghost of Christmas past in
Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' but less celebrated spooks
have haunted the season for a long time. Here's an account of their
ectoplasmic activities.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<BYLINE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Long before and long after Jacob Marley rattled his rosary of
cash boxes, keys and padlocks at Ebenezer Scrooge, a Christmas
ghost, more surely than Santa, would appear at the fireside of many
a stately home and country inn.
   Holiday guests overstuffed with roast goose and mulled port were
less likely to be dreaming of a white Christmas than having
nightmares about graveyard rats gnawing at the tree ornaments or
goblins kidnapping a church sexton.
   That matter of the vanishing verger was Charles Dickens's first
published Christmas ghost story, inspired by a bedtime tale told by
Mary Weller, the Dickens family nursemaid. She filled his
imagination with the phantoms of evil innkeepers making sausage pies
out of complaining guests and hapless travelers terribly tortured by
rats _ phantoms that reappeared in his annual tales to trim the tree
by.
   Mary herself reappeared in ``The Holly Tree,'' that snowbound inn
on the Yorkshire moors where the storyteller at the fireside reaches
back to the nursery and finds himself ``at the knee of a sallow
woman with a fishy eye, an aquiline nose, and a green gown, whose
specialty was a dismal narrative of a landlord whose visitors
unaccountably disappeared...''
   Your genial host at this early variant of the Bates Motel stole
into the guest rooms by a secret passage, slit their throats then
dispatched the bodies down a trap door to copper cauldrons bubbling
below.
   The pie maker was undone, as Dickens respun the cobwebs of his
childhood, when overheard muttering ``too much pepper!'' in his
troubled sleep.
   Ghosts at Christmas? Why not? A child is born, but the year is
dying: 'Tis the season to be mindful of our mortality.
   All the way back to Bethlehem, when the ox and ass knelt with the
shepherds at the manger and the Magi, magicians or wise men from the
East, came calling, Christmas has been a time of mystery and magic.
   The Christmas ghost is older in tradition than the fir tree
trimmed with lights or stockings hung by the chimney with care. The
horror has always gone with the holly, as the Wise Men knew when
they offered the new-born babe the gift myrrh, a burial spice, from
their camel bags.
   In Victorian times, a ghost for Christmas was as common as a
goose.
   With the publication of ``A Christmas Carol'' in 1843, Charles
Dickens became the acknowledged master of the seasonal spooky story,
which he did not invent but refined into an annual event. Even under
pressure of unfinished novels long past the publisher's deadline, a
grim Dickensian word, he would not give up the Christmas ghost. ``I
am loath to lose the money,'' he admitted, ``and still more so to
leave any gap at Christmas firesides which I ought to fill.''
   Christmas ghosts hovered over the writing desks of Sir Walter
Scott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Wilkie Collins, William Thackeray,
Charles Reade, Rudyard Kipling, Elizabeth Bowen, L.P. Hartley and
Lord Dunsany, to name but a few.
   English, French, Scandinavian and American literature abound with
Christmas ghouls, trolls and goblins.
   Such merry merchants of the macabre as Algernon Blackwood, H.P.
Lovecraft, Sheridan LeFanu, Saki and W.W. Jacobs of ``The Monkey's
Paw'' fame observed Christmas with a grisly gothic gift to their
readers.
   As the last line hauntingly confirms, James Joyce's ``The Dead''
is a classic Christmas ghost story: ``His soul swooned slowly as he
heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly
falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and
the dead.''
   In a holiday tale of malicious merriment, English humorist Jerome
K. Jerome warns guests against spending the night in ``The Blue
Chamber'' of his uncle's country manor. The room is haunted every
Christmas Eve ``by the ghost of a most sinful man who once killed a
Christmas carol singer with a lump of coal'' for singing off key.
   The spirit of this sensitive music lover ``did not like to appear
to be boasting'' but he also dispatched seven street musicians
``counting trombones,'' an ``Italian lad who came to town with a
barrel organ that played nothing but Scotch airs'' and an entire
German oompah band.
   A half-century later in a Christmas issue of the New Yorker,
cartoonist Charles Addams struck another blow for Noel noise
abatement. His fiendish friends are seen up on the roof of their
haunted town house pouring down boiling oil on the carolers gathered
on the front stoop.
   ``What is it that makes human beings at Christmas request a very
carnival of crime?'' asked Ambrose Bierce, lexicographer of ``The
Devil's Dictionary.''
   Sisters in crime Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers always
could be relied upon to contribute a holiday homicide to the
carnival.
   In ``Maigret's Christmas,'' Georges Simenon's Gallic gumshoe
investigates the case of an orphan girl visited by a white bearded
Father Christmas who gives her a large doll, then quickly tears up a
few floorboards. ``You come to me on Christmas day, when you know
that I am alone in my house,'' the junk dealer chuckles to Markheim,
his murderer, in Robert Louis Stevenson's splendid descent into the
seasonal spirit world.

   ``My last crime was a Christmas crime,'' arch thief Flambeau
confesses to G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown, ``a cheery, cosy,
English middle-class crime, a crime of Charles Dickens. I did it in
a good old middle-class house near Putney, a house with a crescent
of a carriage drive, a house with a stable by the side of it, a
house with a name on the two outer gates...Enough, you know the
species.''
   The eager Christmas reading public certainly knew the species.
They had been conditioned to it by decades of ghosts haunting the
pages of the Christmas annuals and special gift books, often
sponsored by royalty, that were a matter of pride and profit to
authors and publishers from Victorian times down to the end of World
War II when TV became the main medium, so to speak, for encounters
of the spectral kind.
   These expensively bound and strikingly illustrated volumes had
names like Yule Logs, Christmas Blossoms, Winter's Wreath, Queen
Mary's Gift Book, Christmas Box, Princess Alexandra's Gift Book,
Beeton's Christmas Annual, the Snowflake, Longmans' Annual and St.
Nicholas, which its Boston publishers avowed was ``a Christmas and
New Year's gift made expressly under the direction of St. Nicholas
for all good little girls and boys.''
   In 1834, almost a decade before Scrooge pronounced Christmas a
humbug, there were 63 competing annuals on sale in London, some
running to 450 pages.
   ``These sold at an upscale, enhanced price, so the writers'
market definitely improved at Christmas,'' said Charles Benson,
curator of rare books at Dublin's Trinity College Library. In his
cubicle of an office looking down on the vaulted reading room where
Lord Dunsany and Elizabeth Bowen conjured up their Christmas ghosts
and where the 8th century Book of Kells is on display, Benson spread
out several editions of Beeton's and Longmans' annuals dating back
to l870s.
   ``The enormous demand for these gift books coincided with the
rapid rise in literacy throughout Europe,'' the curator went on.
``Prominently placed on the living room table, they proclaimed both
the giver and the recipient to be people of some culture.''
   Sherlock Holmes made his first appearance in ``A Study in
Scarlet'' in Beeton's 1887 Christmas annual. Author A. Conan Doyle
said the title recognized ``the scarlet thread of murder running
through the colorless skein of life.''
   Edgar Allen Poe and Mary Shelley, creator of Frankenstein,
frequently contributed to gift books. Hawthorne raised his earliest
Puritan phantoms in the pages of The Token and Goodrich's Annual.
   Ghosts ``began to disappear when electricity came in,'' lamented
librarian Benson. ``You seldom get a dark countryside now, those
lonely stretches of road lined with skeletal trees, with mist rising
from the bogs and the fields shrouded in snow, all so essential for
contacting the beyond. Christmas then was a time for ghosts because
as the days grew shorter, the peasants and the landed gentry had
more leisure to swap tales around their fires. Life was short and
precarious. People were much closer to death and the spirit world.''
   Ghost stories are for telling aloud as well as reading, as
Dickens soon discovered to his pleasure and profit. A consummate
actor, he took Scrooge on the road. An overflow crowd of 4,000
turned up at Bradford's Mechanics Institute for his three-hour
stage-cut reading of ``A Christmas Carol,'' and 2,000 jammed into
Birmingham's town hall. A new career and a new tradition were
launched.
   On the night before Christmas at Hyde Park, Franklin D. Roosevelt
always read ``A Christmas Carol'' aloud to the family, acting out
all the parts. Banker J.P. Morgan bought the original Dickens
manuscript and like the born-again Scrooge, ``merry as a
schoolboy,'' had his secretary read it to him each Christmas Eve.
   Cambridge don M.R. James, a learned antiquary and translator of
New Testament apocrypha, read aloud his devilishly clever ghost
stories to friends at King's College every Christmas Eve for more
than three decades, beginning in 1894. As provost of Eton College,
he concocted many of his holiday horrors for the small boys in his
charge and wrote ``The Haunted Dolls House'' specifically ``for the
library of Her Majesty the Queen's Dolls' House.''
   American novelist and global railway chronicler Paul Theroux, who
lives in London, has kept alive this haunting holiday tradition.
Every year when his boys Marcel and Louis were growing up, he wrote
and read to them over three nights a ghost story, ``leaving the
hammer stroke for Christmas Eve.''
   Like Dickens' urchins peeking through the frosted panes of the
bakery, the audience of two was allowed to window-shop for the
ingredients. Their requirements: a scary ghost, lots of snow, a
London setting, a happy ending and, ``Oh yes, please put a cat in.''
   At Hardscribble House in rural Connecticut, where this is being
hand-crafted at a wobbly Victorian stand-up writing desk, we refuse
to let old spooks lie. Ghost stories are always told over a flagon
of smoking bishop or hot purl, the lady of the house being from
Ireland where spectral visitors outnumber poor relations around the
fireside at Christmas. And our guest room is seasonally haunted by
the mournful whistle and dull headlight glow of a long vanished
Lionel model train set endlessly circling beneath the bed on rusty
rails.
   Or could it be the rats from the graveyard across the road
scratching out winter quarters beneath the floorboards and
occasionally venturing out to search for food with those baleful
eyes?

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It is designated as a National Historic Monument,
the last rural Chinese town in America. But while Locke, Calif., was
once the home of hundreds of immigrant laborers who were unwelcome
in white communities, few Chinese are left in the town today and
those who remain are dying out.

<TEXT>
   Lost in limbo between the past and the
future, the tiny town of Locke is quietly decaying on the bank of
the Sacramento River, a sad footnote in the history of America.
   The sagging wood-frame buildings along the block-long Main Street
are the legacy of Chinese immigrants who came to California seeking
a better life and found that the quest of the American dream can be
a nightmare.
   In the '20s and '30s, Chinese villages like Locke _ now
designated a National Historic Monument _ housed the laborers who
built the levees and tilled the fields of California's upper San
Joaquin Valley.
   More than 600 people (mostly men) lived in Locke. Thousands more
would jam the town on weekends, spending hard-earned meager wages in
gambling halls, four restaurants, a half-dozen markets and five
bordellos.
   The Chinese towns thrived because residents weren't welcome in
most other communities. The Chinese could work 10-hour days in the
white world for $1 a day or less, but they too often became targets
for racist attacks at night. The white folks had their towns; the
Chinese had theirs.
   That changed when Japan invaded China and bombed Pearl Harbor.
The ensuing war forever changed the status of Chinese immigrants in
America. It also marked the beginning of the end for Locke.
   After the war, the Chinese were more readily welcomed into
mainstream America, opening doors of opportunity leading out of the
rural ghettos.
   Locke, the last rural Chinese town in America, has about 120
residents now. Almost all are relative newcomers and only 24 are of
Chinese descent. Some work in town or nearby, others are artists and
the rest are retired.
   The once-bustling Main Street is now still, except on weekends
when the curious stop by to visit the art gallery, the curio shops
or the two restaurants. One restaurant is Chinese. The other, which
also serves as an ersatz town center, is universally known as ``Al
The Wop's.''
   Today, only four longtime Chinese residents remain in Locke. They
are the first to admit they are dying out. Four others have died in
the past year.
   ``That's exactly the right word, `dying out,''' says Ping Lee,
who at 71 is the youngest of the town's elders. His father founded
Locke, nee Lockeport, in 1915. Lee himself tried to leave Locke, but
was drawn back by his father's business.
   ``I saw Locke falling so fast, and the population falling,
because the older people are dying off and there are no young people
coming on.''
   Today, Lee is proprietor of The Big Store market in nearby Walnut
Grove, but he still lives in the quiet river town of his birth in a
humble home along one of the town's two back roads.
   His neighbor, Tommy King, 75, has lived in Locke since 1927. He
left only once, to serve in the Air Force as a radio repairman
during World War II. Before the war, he was a laborer. Even now, the
pain of those days is enough to disturb his usually placid demeanor.
   ``Ever work for 10 cents an hour? I didn't even get that. I
worked 10{ hours for a buck. During the Depression, it went lower
than that. It went to 75 cents a day, picking tomatoes. Now,
tomatoes are 70 cents a pound. Now you see a dime in the road and
you let it sit there. It's not worth bending over to pick it up.''
   King _ whose wife, Connie, runs a gallery on Main Street _ and
most of the other elders, didn't even realize in their youth they
were victims of discrimination.
   ``I think I was too young to comprehend what was happening,'' he
recalls, sitting in the sun on a homemade bench in the vegetable
garden beside his home. ``We went to segregated schools, and we just
thought that's the way it is.''
   King and Lee compare the plight of Chinese laborers to the
treatment of Mexican migrant laborers in California today.
   ``But actually they're better off than my ancestors,'' King says,
``because the Mexicans are protected by law.''
   Chinese immigrants were victimized by law. Under the California
1913 Alien Land Act, Chinese were barred from owning land. The law
was not declared unconstitutional until 1952.
   Because of that law, Locke was built on a 500-acre ranch owned by
George Locke. Although the Chinese built their homes here, they have
never owned the land. Even today, the houses are owned by
individuals, the land is owned by a corporation. But today, the
corporation is owned by Chinese.
   The injustices of the past, the ownership of the land, the
designation of Locke as a national monument and the passing of the
town elders has left the town's residents worried about the future.
There is endless debate about what could happen, what will happen,
what should happen.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Soap operas are not known for heavy social
philosophy or ethnic diversity. So it was unusual, to say the least,
for two Orthodox Jews to make an appearance on NBC's ``Day of Our
Lives.'' The explanation is Leah Laiman, and she knew whereof she
wrote.

<TEXT>
   Leah Laiman's life would make a lousy soap opera.
   She was raised an Orthodox Jew in Hamilton, Ontario, where she
spent her weekends reading the classics. She moved to New York and
attended a Jewish women's college. She did hang around Greenwich
Village one summer, though she didn't exactly blend into the crowd.
``I was the only orthodox kosher virgin beatnik in New York,'' she
says _ until her father showed up to take her home.
   It is, therefore, no small irony that Laiman, a woman with barely
a nodding acquaintance with life's seamy side, should wind up as the
head writer for one of the seamier soaps, NBC's ``Days of Our
Lives.''
   Soap Opera Digest rated it the most violent soap on television.
``Bad planning,'' Laiman explains. Murder and mayhem are simply ``a
cheap way to end a Friday. The show did go through a period where
there was a lot of violence toward women. I'm sorry for that.''
   Other than that, though, Laiman makes no apology for the violence
and sex served up on her soap. ``Sure, soap operas are full of sex
and violence,'' she says. ``But they are not like movies and they
aren't rated `R.' There is a limit to what you can do.
   ``And in a way, soaps are very moralistic. Yes, people do naughty
things, but the bad people always get punished. The good guys always
win and get lots of fan mail.''
   Salem U.S.A., the show's fictional location, is a slightly more
enlightened place than the ``white-bread town'' Laiman found when
she moved over from ABC's General Hospital three years ago.
   Like most soap opera settings, Salem remains overwhelmingly white
middle class. ``There are two blacks,'' she says. ``And everybody's
Christian.''
   Not quite everyone, it turns out.
   Enter the first Orthodox Jewish characters in the soap opera's
history.
   ``Some people who watch these shows probably don't know any
Jews,'' she explains. ``I just wanted to show they have no horns.''
   She created Robin, a beautiful young doctor who just happened to
be an Orthodox Jew. Robin fell in love with Mike, also a doctor and,
as luck would have it, a Christian.
   ``Robin's father was a pharmacist. He wore a yarmulke all the
time. Robin never ate out. In the (non-kosher) cafeteria at the
hospital, all she could eat was salad.''
   Since intimate dinner dates are a soap opera staple, Laiman
created a kosher deli and saw to it Robin stayed home on the
Sabbath. On Friday nights, ``she lit candles and wouldn't answer the
phone or ride in the car unless it was a medical emergency.''
   Mike gave serious thought to converting, then realized he
couldn't give up his heritage. Eventually, Laiman resolved the plot
by having Robin and her father leave town.
   Laiman regrets that their departure meant there were no more Jews
in Salem. Still, the alternatives would have been worse. For Robin
to marry a non-Jew or worse, to abandon her own religion, would be
out of the question.
   In charting the soap's plot, Laiman remains mindful of her
influence over the audience. ``I would never let a woman have an
abortion and go crazy about it,'' she says. ``I might not have an
abortion myself, but it's not up to me to put that in the show and
influence people.''
   After six years in the soap opera business _ she worked on
``General Hospital'' for three years before moving to ``Days'' _
Laiman says, ``I'm still shocked to this day that people respond to
the show the way they do. They identify so totally with these
people's lives, they see them only as these characters.''
   As head writer, Laiman's job is to map out the story, which is
subject to approval by the network. Associate head writers break the
plot down into daily segments. Dialogue writers fill in the daily
scripts.
   The show is filmed in Los Angeles, but Laiman prefers to stay in
New York. She travels to the West Coast for meetings, but spends
most of her time in the Manhattan apartment she shares with her
husband, producer-director Ralph Toporoff, her stepdaughter,
Melinda, 19, and her 15-month-old baby, Danielle. The couple also
has a stepson, Ian, 23.
   Writing a soap opera ``doesn't require tremendous writing talent,
though it does require skill and understanding of the medium,''
Laiman says.
   ``Soaps appeal to middle-of-the-road conservatives. Television is
not about public service. It's about advertising dollars and ratings
and not offending viewers.''
   Still, she keeps an eye out for ways to incorporate her values
into the show, and to pass along responsible information whenever
possible.
   When the story line dealt with sex abuse, Laiman included a
hot-line number at the end of the episode. She also tried to ``make
it very clear that sexual abuse is not the victim's fault.''
   With Robin's departure, Salem is, for the time being, once again
an all-Christian town. But Laiman says plans are already in the
works to bring Robin back.
   In the meantime, there are other ways to get her points across.
Coming up: a love story involving a plastic surgeon who happens to
be black.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ West Virginia seemed like a prime proving ground
when Congress created the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1964.
One of the first and one of the biggest of the anti-poverty agencies
was set up in Mingo County, one of the most stubborn pockets of
poverty in all of Appalachia. But over the years the Mingo County
Economic Opportunity Commission fell into the hands of a corrupt
political establishment it was created to fight.

<TEXT>
   In the 1960s, when Congress voted to
fight poverty by organizing the poor to fight for themselves, the
rallying cry was, ``power to the people.''
   What developed in Mingo County lends credence to a much older
adage, ``power corrupts.''
   In 1965, when the Mingo County Economic Opportunity Commission
was formed, the anti-poverty agency quickly became a thorn in the
side of the political establishment. But over the years it became an
ally of the establishment, until federal prosecutors started sending
EOC officials to jail.
   ``The EOC was a product of the 1960s, and the 1960s was a very
anti-establishment period,'' says Carl Bradford, trustee director of
the Mingo County EOC. ``All this was done the way the EOC wanted it
done. And the idea was to give them lots of money to go out and beat
up on the establishment.''
   ``Lots of money'' was the key, especially in a place like Mingo
County, where it seems there is never enough to go around. Today,
the EOC's annual $1.6 million budget is a major economic force in
the county, second only to the county commission, which has a budget
of $2.74 million, and the board of education, which controls 20
percent of the jobs in the county. The EOC provides jobs and
essential services to some 2,000 Mingo residents.
   But somewhere along the way, the power and money corrupted: At
least five top EOC officials have been convicted on federal charges
of defrauding the agency, including long-time director Larry
Hamrick. He was sentenced to 12 years in a federal prison for
siphoning off anti-poverty funds for his personal use and to
influence county politicians.
   Hamrick allegedly defrauded the anti-poverty commission of more
than $60,000. Prosecutors said he ordered checks totaling more than
$42,000 to be written to one individual, purportedly for hauling
coal to low-income families. They said, however, that the bulk of
the money was kicked back to Hamrick.
   Hamrick also allegedly arranged for employees to be listed on the
commission books as job-training developers when they actually had
jobs within the agency. Prosecutors said Hamrick also arranged for
about $10,500 to be given from the EOC's administrative account to
relatives of a commission employee, money that also came back to
Hamrick.
   Hamrick, after pleading guilty to charges of fraud, obstruction
of justice and conspiracy, testified in another Mingo County trial
that he on several occasions approved travel checks for Don Chafin,
an EOC official who also pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Hamrick
said there was ``no basis'' for the checks other than ``Chafin said
he was short money in his checking account.''
   On other occasions, Hamrick said, he and Chafin shared the
proceeds of checks made out to another EOC employee who ``cashed
them and gave the money back to me and I split it with Don Chafin
exactly even.''
   ``Money is what runs through the veins of the political system
and they found the fountain of youth,'' says assistant U.S. attorney
Joe Savage.
   West Virginia seemed like a prime proving ground when Congress
created the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1964. The act spawned
community action agencies nationwide, all based on the idea that
poverty could be eradicated by giving poor people the power to
challenge the forces that kept them poor. One of the first, and one
of the biggest, was quickly set up in Mingo County, one of the most
stubborn pockets of poverty in all of Appalachia.

   ``Congress decided that low-income people were suffering because
government _ and the rest of the establishment _ wasn't giving them
their fair share,'' Bradford says. ``It was set up to attack local
government as a grass roots organization.''
   Organization was the second key. Bradford said the way to attack
the local power structure was obvious.
   ``Once you get past picketing and protesting as a method of
forcing change, the more effective way is at the ballot box,''
Bradford says. The EOC's first director, a young Mingo County
teacher named Huey Perry, capitalized on the ``power to the people''
mandate and quickly organized the poor into a counter political
structure.
   Perry, now a Huntington businessman manufacturing medical
equipment, contends that the success of the concept was its
downfall. He described his experiences with the EOC and its fight
with the Mingo power structure in a 1975 book called, ``They'll Cut
Off Your Project.'' That success was a threat, Perry said, and, in
1968, Congress changed the laws governing the Offfice of Economic
Opportunity to take away the anti-poverty agencies' independence and
return control to county governments.
   ``All of our expectations were very high _ that we were going to
be able to turn things around,'' Perry says. ``But at the national
level, they didn't want it. It was too much upheaval. That had to be
stopped, and I don't think we'll ever see that kind of social
experiment again.''
   With those changes, the ``social experiment'' soon became part of
the existing power structure. Perry moved on to other projects, and
the man he had hired as his deputy _ Larry Hamrick _ took over as
director.
   ``Hamrick would literally have taken the shirt off his back and
given it to you if he thought you needed it,'' Perry says. He tells
how one day he and Hamrick spotted a car that had gone off the
narrow highway and into a stream badly swollen by recent rains.
   ``Larry didn't hesitate,'' Perry says. ``He jumped out of our car
and was in that water waist deep to pull people out of that car.''
   A very different man was described in the federal indictments
that sent Hamrick to prison. According to one indictment, Hamrick
threatened a hospitalized man who was a prosecution witness.
Pointing to the oxygen tank by the bed of Kenneth ``Bubby''
Phillips, Hamrick told him, ``There could be carbon monoxide in
it.'' Hamrick also was accused of intimidating another grand jury
witness, putting his hands around her throat and threatening to
choke her to death.
   After the federal government returned power over the poverty
agencies to county government, Perry said, ``I guess Larry chose to
work with them, became entailed in the system and became part of
it.''
   ``At first, he probably rationalized that he was protecting the
poor people in what he was doing...Had he not chosen the path he
did, he would have been fired within the year and the director would
have been somebody else the machine could have controlled.''
   These days, the Mingo County EOC is firmly in the control of the
establishment. This time, however, the establishment appears to be
Republican, an oddity in heavily Democratic Mingo County. A group
calling itself ``Voices of Concern'' has demanded the resignation of
executive director Tim Crum, a registered Republican who was elected
mayor of the town of Kermit on a non-partisan ticket, and has
expressed concern that the agency has become a GOP stronghold.
   Crum was recommended to the EOC board by Bradford, who was
appointed EOC trustee director by Republican Gov. Arch Moore when
Hamrick was indicted.
   Regardless of who is in control in Mingo County, Perry says he
believes that the economic system the EOC tried to challenge is the
source of Mingo's political quagmire. ``There's no question, in my
mind, that the poverty there breeds this kind of politics,'' he says.
   ``People who are ambitious see politics as the way you make
money, the way you succeed, the way you get power. But, if the
economy were better, ambitious people might try to succeed in some
economic sense.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Growing up in Idaho, Terry Domico never cared
much for bears. So the free-lance writer wasn't exactly thrilled
when a literay agent suggested that he do a book about the beasts.
But he wound up traveling around the world photographing and
observing bears in the wild and in the process became an ardent
advocate of protecting endangered animals.

   Terry Domico and his Japanese companions quietly
approach a black bear den on Japan's Honchu Island, with plans to
film the hibernating beast through a hole in the den wall.
   All of a sudden, a 400-pound ball of fur and teeth explodes from
the snow.
   The bear grabs the shirt of a graduate student as another student
and a researcher try to flee, floundering in the deep spring snow.
   Domico pulls a canister of bear repellent that he has never used
before from his back pocket. One shot of the stuff from about 12
feet away is enough to make the animal release the student.
   But the bear then turns on Domico. He screams ``No!'' and fires
one more shot of repellent into the bear's face, sending the huge
animal running.
   Domico recalls dropping into the snow, shaking, and turning on
his tape recorder to babble his impressions of the experience.
   The attack was just one of the adventures Domico, 43, a
free-lance writer and photographer who lives on San Juan Island in
Washington state, had while researching his book, ``Bears of the
World.''
   Domico and his publisher pitch the book, released in November by
Facts on File Inc. in New York, as an up-to-date, authoritative book
on bears.
   Among the few Westerners allowed into the Wolong panda preserve
in China, Domico and fellow photographer Mark Newman went in 1987
for an update on the $2.7 million project sponsored by World
Wildlife Fund International.
   What they found, they say, was a drop in the panda population,
partly because of heavy timber harvesting and farming on the
preserve. They also discovered illegal markets that sell panda and
other animal parts, considered valuable for medicinal purposes.
   ``I was so incensed,'' Domico says. ``According to Chinese
estimates, there were 700 pandas in 1987. Now they're talking 500.
They can't lose 200 pandas a year, or they're not going to have
any.''
   On the Malaysian island of Borneo, Domico estimates that no more
than 500 sun bears survive.
   Adult bears are poached for their meat and the cubs are raised as
pets until they're confiscated by the government and released to the
wild, where their fate is unknown.
   Domico and Newman never found a totally wild sun bear, but for
many days observed and photographed one released to the wild and
actually helped the bear learn to be a bear.
   Domico, who grew up in Idaho, wasn't initially enthused when a
literary agent suggested a book about bears.
   ``I started this with all kinds of prejudices,'' he says. ``I
personally didn't like bears very much. I was scared of them. But I
soon learned that everything I knew about bears was wrong, and I was
hooked.
   ``I'm not afraid of them now. But I respect them very much.''
   Domico's book, says Gerard Helferich, editor in chief for Facts
on File, ``explodes a lot of myths about bears.''
   For instance, Domico says, bears can see much better than is
commonly thought. They look peripherally, avoiding direct stares
because that constitutes a challenge and almost always leads to
confrontation.
   Domico photographed legendary Kermode bear, an endangered
subspecies that is white and lives in northern British Columbia. A
British Columbia conservation officer led him to their secret home
after Domico promised he wouldn't divulge the location.
   Many bears, including the black, brown and polar bear, are doing
quite well worldwide, Domico learned. They are being better managed
and their habitat has improved.
   But they're also getting 90 percent of the money being spent on
bears, says Dr. Charles Jonkel of the University of Montana's
environmental studies program, the man Domico calls ``the father of
bear biology.''
   By comparison, the endangered panda, sun and spectacled bears,
which exist only in China, Southeast Asia and South America,
respectively, can't be properly supported by their governments,
which are struggling to feed their human populations, Domico says.
   ``Conservation is a pastime of rich nations,'' he says. ``But one
thing China is sensitive to is outside criticism. Public opinion
will force China to save the pandas.''
   Domico is urging letter writing campaigns by WWF, National
Geographic and environmentalists to improve the save-the-panda
effort and to initiate campaigns to save the sun and spectacled
bears.
   ``The Malaysian reserves are isolated,'' he says. ``If they're
going to save sun bears and other large species, they're going to
have to keep those areas contiguous. China has to streamline its
bureaucracy so it's effective. Most of the money gets spent on
bureaucracy before it ever gets down to where the animal is.''
   China within the last year imposed sentences of life in prison or
death for panda poachers, and Rich Block, director of public
programs for the American chapter of WWF in Washington D.C., says
several people are serving life terms for the crime.
   Domico also is encouraging Western zoos to better coordinate
captive breeding programs. There are fewer than 20 pandas
permanently in Western zoos, and loan programs are declining in
popularity as scientists question whether the loan program does the
pandas' cause any good, Block says. The captive breeding effort may
have to remain concentrated in China.
   Domico says he hopes the 189-page book, which includes a safety
manual, will help highlight the plight of some bear species and do
for them what whale books written 15 years ago did for that species.

   It's no mystery why actor Sam Robards quit the
legitimate theater and went hunting for a television series.
   ``I needed to make some money,'' says Robards, who comes from a
distinguished acting family with roots in New York. ``I spent seven
years working in the theater. I was tired of making $160 a week and
being in debt all the time.''
   Robards and his wife, actress Suzy Amis, packed up, moved from
New York into a rented house in Los Angeles and bought furniture at
garage sales. Their marriage was a case of life imitating art. They
played husband and wife in the movie ``Fandango,'' and afterward got
married.
   ``I came out for the pilot season and read for a whole mess of
things,'' he says. ``I was offered two pilots, and I chose this
one.''
   The one he chose was ``TV 101,'' a one-hour drama on CBS about a
high school journalism teacher who brings the school newspaper into
the electronic age. He sets up a television news show on the
school's internal network, which enables the student journalists to
learn (according to network publicity) as much about themselves and
their own lives as they do about television.
   Robards stars as Kevin Keegan, an iconoclast whose return to
teaching at his alma mater doesn't inspire enthusiasm from the
principal who remembers his troubled days as a student.
   Robards had to read seven times for the role, twice after he did
a screen test. ``I was the first person they saw for the role,'' he
says, ``but they were committed to the great American talent search.
They went to New York, Chicago, they saw everybody. I had to fight
for the role.''
   On a lunch break at the Culver Studios, Robards eats soup from a
large Styrofoam cup in a barren conference room. He has the flu, but
is fighting it rather than miss a day's work.
   Robards has butted heads with the producers at Grant Tinker's GTG
Entertainment over interpretation of his character.
   ``The way I play him is decidedly different from the way the
creators saw him,'' he says. ``I guess we're ironing it out as we go
along.
   ``To me, Keegan's a guy who's lost. He's been through a lot, he's
seen a lot, but he's lost, especially in this environment. Their
idea is that he's sort of able to get by. There are no
life-and-death issues for him, except when it comes to his daughter
and ex-wife.''
   The story presents Keegan as a former free-lance television
newsman who has worked in Latin America.
   ``He witnessed a lot of unpleasantness, but he was just an
observer,'' Robards says. ``That was how he got by. `I'm just
shooting it with my camera, so I'm not responsible for any of it.'
So, after being complacent and irresponsible, he comes into the
school and tries to make a difference.''
   Like most of the cast on ``TV 101,'' Robards is a virtual
newcomer to the television audience. He starred earlier this season
with Valerie Bertinelli in ``Pancho Barnes.'' He has also done a few
guest roles on series and has a tiny role in the movie ``Bird.'' He
has an equally small part in director Brian de Palma's upcoming
Vietnam film ``Casualties of War.''
   ``I guess it was deliberate to put so many new people in the cast
so you wouldn't have anyone overshadowing the concept of the show,''
he says.
   Robards is the son of Jason Robards Jr. and Lauren Bacall. His
grandfather was the late character actor Jason Robards Sr.
   Although he grew up in an acting household, he went through the
usual boyhood ambitions, such as policeman and ballplayer, before
becoming an actor at the age of 19.
   ``I was ejected from Sarah Lawrence College for lousy grades,''
he says. ``I'd always played football throughout my school years.
When I left school I went to the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in
Connecticut and studied there for a while. Then I went on an
audition and got a job as an understudy and assistant stage manager.
   ``Acting wasn't something I'd dreamed about. I'd been around it
all my life. I knew the business side of it. It wasn't so glamorous.
The stage is where you do the best acting, but there's no money in
it. I tried films. If I can make a name for myself I can get better
parts instead of being the first man they see after lunch.''
   With his father he has done only a few scenes _ excerpts from
O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' that deal with
alcoholism.
   ``I guess we did it in part because my father had been
addicted,'' he says. ``That play illustrates so clearly its effects
on a family.''
   Robards isn't sure whether having famous parents was a help or
not.
   ``I think I was seen for a lot of things because of my parents,''
he says. ``People wanted to see if I was capable of doing anything.
Some people had a preconception and looked for something bad. It's
getting better now. I can be more on my own.''

   At 19, Barry Williams was a television
heartthrob, receiving 800 fan letters a week. At 25, he had to
scramble for work, redirecting his faltering career from television
to theater.
   Now, nearly 20 years after he first played older brother Greg
Brady on ``The Brady Bunch,'' the 34-year-old Williams finds himself
doing both theater and television.
   He's making his Broadway debut in the musical ``Romance Romance''
and appearing in a new ``Brady Bunch'' special, ``A Very Brady
Christmas,'' to be televised Sunday, Dec. 18, on CBS.
   ``Part of an actor's life is just being ready, tuned and
stretched to work,'' he says, although he asked to look at the
script before he decided to do the new Brady movie. But when the
chance came to audition for ``Romance Romance,'' he didn't hesitate.
   It's not as if Williams hadn't done any musicals recently. In
fact, he has done four in the last year in places such as Kansas
City, Pittsburgh and Birmingham, Mich.
   Williams joined the cast of ``Romance Romance'' in October. The
show, running since May at the Helen Hayes Theater, is two small
musicals in one. In Act I, the actor plays an amorous
turn-of-the-century Viennese dandy. In the second act, he's a
happily married man contemplating an affair.
   ``I don't think I've had a better role in terms of scope and in
terms of growth,'' he says. ``They are two separate musicals with
completely different acting styles. I have to be in top shape for
this show.''
   Williams wasn't always a singer. He started studying at 16 during
the glory days of ``The Brady Bunch.'' The show, which ran for five
seasons on ABC, was one of the last of the innocent family comedies.
The cast included a widow, a widower, six kids, a maid and a dog.
Problems were resolved happily before the last commercial.
   Williams, who was raised in California, started performing at age
11 after persuading his parents to let him attend acting classes.
   ``I was pretty precocious as a child,'' he recalls. ``I liked the
idea of being different people and characters, kind of what acting
is. It looked like a fun thing to do.''
   Before being cast on ``The Brady Bunch,'' Williams appeared on
just about every well-known television series of the late 1960s.
From ``The FBI'' to ``That Girl'' to ``Gomer Pyle'' to ``It Takes a
Thief'' to ``Mod Squad'' to ``Marcus Welby,'' he found work. ``The
Brady Bunch'' pretty much monopolized his teen-age years.
   ``When you've only got one childhood, you don't know if you're
missing a normal one or not,'' he says. ``I think being a teen-ager
is a fate akin to illness. It's a very difficult period, any way you
cut it.''
   Williams' problems started later.
   ``In my own life, I found that I went through my own teen-age
rebellion in my mid-20s because I had to be so serious and
responsible as a teen-ager,'' he says. ``I didn't have time to
rebel.''
   Typecast because of his association with ``The Brady Bunch,'' and
regarded within the television industry as only capable of light
comedy, he was thought of as a teen-ager, even after he passed 21.
   ``I didn't understand why I had to audition,'' Williams recalls.
``After all, I had credits. I had been working a long time. It's a
very arrogant attitude, ludicrous in this business. I was back on
the proving block again and I didn't feel that I was supposed to
prove myself.''
   Still, Williams got jobs. He always was able to do several
musicals or regional theater offerings a year, but that would leave
periods of six or seven months when he didn't work.
   ``I was in trouble for a while,'' Williams says. ``I borrowed
money, sold a house and I gambled. I even dissolved investments to
get some sort of cash going. I was dipping from the well.''
   What saved him was that he got hungry for a career and realized
he wasn't having one.
   ``What I did was change my attitude,'' he says. ``I came to
realize that refusing to audition was kind of an excuse for not
really putting myself back on the line.
   ``I decided I wouldn't use `The Brady Bunch' to work against me,
and I wouldn't use it to work for me. I just had it as a credit, one
part of my career. It was like starting over again.''
   The theater has given him employment during the lean years.
Eventually, he would love to do an action adventure television
series.
   ``I'm always looking for something else,'' Williams says. ``When
I have a steady job and I'm working, then the business is fine. But
if I'm out of work for more than 10 days, I'm already looking for
something else to do.''
   ``The Brady Bunch'' may have left network television in the
mid-1970s, but it lives on in rerun heaven. The series is still
televised by many local stations as well as by Ted Turner's
Atlanta-based SuperStation.
   Williams doesn't watch the old episodes.
   ``It's a little like home movies,'' he says. ``I know how they
turn out.''
   The TV movie was a natural, considering television's insatiable
appetite for nostalgia, even for something that occurred as recently
as 1974. But before Williams agreed to do the movie, he asked to see
the script. He liked what he read, particularly the fact that Greg
was now grown up and responsible _ a doctor, married and with a son.
   Williams filmed the Christmas movie last summer along with most
of the original cast members, including Florence Henderson, Robert
Reed and Ann B. Davis.
   ``It was a good experience, working with people I like a lot,''
he says. ``I'm glad we're doing a reunion because it somehow sort of
legitimizes all of those early years. It almost makes them current.
   ``I could go my whole life and never do another `Brady Bunch'
episode and it would be OK because Greg has a kid and he's a doctor
and he's married. It answers the question `Whatever happened to Greg
Brady?'''

<HEAD>West Germany Buying Back Art that `Wandered' During Nazi Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quietly, unobtrusively and with limited
funds, West Germany has been buying back important artworks that
left the country during the Nazi era.
   Officials involved in the slow recovery of what Germans call
their ``wandered culture'' decline to say how much they've spent to
bring home some historically important works.
   But at least $29 million is known to have been spent over the
past five years in the effort the government has deliberately kept
on a low key.
   West Germany struggles with a particularly acute problem of
exiled art because of the volume of works sold during World War II
to help bankroll the Nazi war effort.
   Thousands of paintings, manuscripts, sculptures and other
cultural goods were salvaged from private collections or produced
abroad by Jews and intellectuals hounded from their homeland by
Adolf Hitler's regime. But only a fraction of the displaced art made
its way back to Germany after the war.
   ``We have no defined plan for buying up all the important
artworks that have wandered out of the country over the years, but
when the opportunity arises we make our best effort to get back what
has been lost,'' explained Hans Hieronymus, who heads the Interior
Ministry's office responsible for art acquisitions.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Hieronymus produced a
list of the major works repatriated over the past few months. They
included three 16th century paintings by Albrecht Durer, original
compositions of Richard Wagner and Robert Schumann, Franz Kafka's
1920 manuscript of ``The Trial'' and some personal letters, and a
1463 edition of ``The Apocalypse,'' one of the earliest products of
Johann Gutenberg's block-printing press.
   The most stunning indication of West Germany's commitment to
restoration of Germany's cultural heritage was the purchase five
years ago of The Gospel of Henry the Lionhearted, a handwritten,
552-page, 12th century volume that has commanded the highest price
to date for a book _ $18.8 million.
   A government art appraiser, Hartmut Vogel, says the Henry the
Lionhearted purchase was an inspiring success for West German art
circles as it rewarded an unprecedented effort of cooperation among
the sometimes fractious state and federal art dealers and private
cultural foundations.
   ``This was our masterpiece acquisition, but for the most part our
funds are too small to achieve much headway,'' Vogel told AP.
   He alluded to the purchase in mid-November of the Kafka
manuscript by the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg as a bargain at $1.98
million. But that kind of surprise acquisition is unlikely to be
pulled off with any degree of frequency, he conceded.
   ``We have to be careful not to appear to be hunting dogs,'' said
Verena Tafel, one of five art historians busy collecting works for
West Berlin's Museum of German History, expected to open in the late
1990s.
   ``Every national museum tries to repatriate those artworks that
were lost during the Nazi regime,'' Ms. Tafel said. ``But being too
aggressive can have the result of driving the prices up.''
   An official with the Interior Ministry who spoke only on
condition of anonymity said recovery of famous German works from
abroad is an important facet of the government's acquisition policy,
``but we'd be stupid to publicly present this as a campaign.''
   He explained that a restrained profile in the international art
market is essential in outbidding hesitant competitors, and for West
German buyers to put out the word that they are embarked on a
repatriation project would serve only to price themselves out of the
market.
   Ms. Tafel noted, however, that museum collectors have to maintain
a delicate balance between discretion and enlisting popular support.
After learning of the West German government's plan to open a
historical museum in West Berlin, she said, the St. Louis Science
Center this fall returned free of charge an early German-made
scientific model of the human body that had been taken out of the
country during the Nazi period.
   Earlier this year, the U.S. government agreed to return about
6,200 paintings and drawings from the Nazi period that were
confiscated at the end of World War II. The propaganda artworks
commissioned by Hitler to depict model soldiers and citizens are
currently in storage at the Bavarian Army Museum in Ingolstadt
pending official decisions on how they should be presented.
   In cases where outright purchase is the only means of retrieving
expatriated artworks or items of special interest for German
museums, West German buyers concede they are fighting a losing
battle against wealthy Japanese collectors and British and American
curators with claims to significantly larger private funding sources.
   Sabine Fehlemann, director of the Von der Heydt Museum in
Wuppertal, traveled to London on Nov. 28 with authorization to bid
as high as $5.8 million for Pablo Picasso's ``The Acrobat and the
Young Harlequin.'' The bidding was opened at $8.6 million and closed
with the $38.6 million offer of Tokyo collector Akio Nishino.
   The 1905 masterpiece was a treasured possession of Wuppertal
until 1937, when Nazi forces confiscated the painting, declared it
``degenerate art'' and sold it to a Swiss collector for 80,000 Swiss
francs.
   ``I thought we had little chance,'' Ms. Fehlemann said after the
auction. ``But I wanted to see our Picasso just once more before it
disappears into a Japanese repository.''
   West German state collectors contend they enjoy fewer advantages
in the international art arena than their competitors because of the
dearth of private foundations to generate funds for public
acquisitions.
   The Interior Ministry's Hieronymus explained that public
offerings of important artworks often are advertised only a few
weeks or days prior to the auction, triggering a scramble for
donations from each of the 10 West German states, the federal
government and the public foundations. The cumbersome effort often
serves to stall presentation of a reasonable bid, he conceded.
   Increasingly priced out of the market for the best-known works,
the state collectors have concentrated instead on preventing the
further migration of German treasures.
   Under a 1955 law that charges the state with protecting national
culture, some 1,000 artworks in West Germany are designated by the
government as national valuables, restricting though not prohibiting
their sale or exchange abroad.
   ``We have to concentrate on preventing further losses,'' Ms.
Tafel said.
   ``In general, if a famous German work of art is on public display
in another country, that's enough to make us happy,'' she said.
``We're not like Melina Mercouri (the former actress who is Greece's
culture minster) _ we don't insist that everything must come back.''

<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until just a few years ago, the gates of this
old walled city were closed every night at 9 o'clock, as they had
been for centuries in a country where slavery still existed.
   Strangers had to carry oil lanterns so that guards would not
shoot them as intruders.
   Medicines, radios, schools, eye glasses and even trousers were
forbidden.
   The country, the size of New Mexico and perched on the
southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula, was trapped in the Middle
Ages by a despotic and eccentric sultan, Said bin Taimur, who sought
to keep the 20th century at bay.
   Now, with its oil wealth, Oman has been transformed into a modern
state that has survived the traumas of the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war
at its doorstep.
   The war has also heightened Oman's strategic importance as one of
the guardians of the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the Persian
Gulf. It shares control of the narrow waterway with Iran.
   The transition from the 16th century to the space age has taken
Oman, the second largest country on the Arabian peninsula after
Saudi Arabia, less than two decades.
   Oman was propelled through this time warp by Sultan Said's only
son, Qaboos bin Said, who toppled his father in a bloodless coup at
his palace in Salalah, in southern Oman, July 23, 1970.
   The old sultan was flown by Britain's Royal Air Force to
well-appointed exile in London's swank Claridge's Hotel, where he
died two years later, surrounded by the very modernity he had shut
out since he took power in 1932.
   Qaboos, who trained at Britain's Sandhurst military academy and
travelled throughout Europe, had been under virtual house arrest by
his father for the previous three years in the belief he had been
tainted by foreign influences.
   Although Qaboos, 48, opened up his country to the outside world,
it remains partially veiled, its society still deeply rooted in
traditional Islamic values and customs.
   Omanis were among the first to embrace Islam when it spread
through the Arabian peninsula in the 7th century.
   Qaboos is an absolute monarch who permits no elections or
political parties. A couple of years ago he formed a consultative
assembly of appointed officials.
   Omanis are not allowed to marry foreigners. If they marry abroad,
they can't bring their families home, and they run the risk of
losing their citizenship. In the past, many Omani men sought foreign
wives to avoid having to pay dowries, traditional in the Arab world.
   In an effort to phase out what he has called ``the evil dowry
system,'' Qaboos last year ruled that no man should pay more than
2,000 riyals ($5,180) for a bride. He regularly exhorts sheiks and
other leaders to curb the dowry system during his annual three-week
meet-the-people safaris around the country.
   Drinking in public is prohibited. But foreigners, and a growing
number of younger Omanis, can imbibe freely in Muscat's hotels. The
penalties for drunkenness are severe, however.
   The news and journalists are restricted, as they are in most Arab
countries.
   Despite its breathtaking 1,800 miles of lagoon-studded Arabian
Sea coastline, tourists were kept out until a couple of years ago
because they were seen as a potential threat to Oman's traditions.
   Commerce and Industry Minister Salim bin Abdullah al-Ghazali
noted in a recent report: ``We don't want to see hippies with long
hair and dirty jeans ... in any part of the sultanate. We want
tourists who are mature in both behavior and outlook.''
   Despite the idiosyncracies of the old Sultan Said, Oman has a
long history of contact with the outside world.
   In the first millenium B.C., Omani seafarers sailed with the
monsoon winds to India and East Africa. In the 7th century, Omani
traders were sailing as far as China in their ocean-going wooden
dhows.
   Oman became a key trading center between the Arabian hinterland
and the Orient.
   The coming of steamships in the 1860s dealt a death blow to
Oman's mercantile power. It remained a key maritime and trading
crossroads for a while, but gradually slipped back into
near-medieval stagnation that ended only when Qaboos took power.
   On the steep, jagged cliffs that form Muscat's natural harbor,
sailors who have dropped anchor over the centuries have carved or
painted the names of their ships in big letters in the rock in a
bizarre visitors' book.
   Adm. Horatio Nelson, the victor of Trafalgar, was among the
visitors when he was a lowly midshipman aboard a Royal Navy vessel,
a British official noted.
   Today, Qaboos' gleaming Al-Alam palace, built in 1979, dominates
the seafront at Muscat, which means ``anchorage.'' Old brass cannons
on wooden carriages sit outside _ alongside modern anti-aircraft
guns on the seawall.
   When Qaboos seized power, Oman was wracked by an insurgency in
southern Dhofar province. With British, Jordanian and Iranian help
he crushed that revolt, which was backed by neighboring South Yemen,
the only Marxist country in the Arab world.
   With the oil discovered in 1964, although modest in volume
compared to other Persian Gulf states, Qaboos launched his
modernization program.
   In Sultan Said's day, there were only a few miles of paved road,
three religious schools, 15 telephones, two small hospitals, no
hotels and one small electricity generator in Muscat, installed in
the late 1960s.
   Now, Oman has nearly 2,000 miles of hardtop highways, about 700
schools, technical colleges and a university with some 220,000
students, 130 hospitals and clinics, nearly 50,000 telephones linked
by satellite to the outside world and 24 power stations.
   Annual per capita income has soared from $400 to nearly $6,000.
Schools, hospitals and other welfare programs are subsidised.
   But a generation is growing up with no experience of the
pre-Qaboos era.
   This has brought fears that young people will take today's
benefits for granted, raising expectations that may not be
sustainable at present levels once Oman's oil runs out. At the
current production rate of 600,000 barrels a day, this is expected
sometime in the next century.
   ``No one under 20 can remember how bad things were before 1970,''
said a Westerner who has lived in Oman for several years. ``People
have got used to the good things and unless that quality of life can
be maintained, there's some uncertainty about the future.
   ``Qaboos is trying to diversify the economy so he's not dependent
on oil.''
   The fall in oil prices has slowed development. But diplomats
noted that major projects and the basic infrastructure were already
completed before prices tumbled.
   ``We're concerned about oil prices, but there's no use crying
over spilt milk,'' Information Minister Abdul Aziz bin Mohammed
Rowes said. ``But we're cautiously optimistic that prices will
recover. We've lived without oil before and we'll just have to
tighten our belts.''
   He added: ``We're proceeding with a policy of Omanization,
gradually trimming the expatriates who've helped us develop. The
results so far are encouraging and we haven't sacrificed
performance. We're aiming for harmony.''

   Here are some facts and figures on Oman:
   THE LAND _ Oman lies at the southern end of the Persian Gulf and
covers 120,000 square miles (about the size of New Mexico), with
1,000 miles of coastline in the Strait of Hormuz and the Indian
Ocean. The rocky Musamdam peninsula jutting into the Strait of
Hormuz is separated from rest of the country by the United Arab
Emirates.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The Omanis are Moslem Arabs from the Qahtan tribes
that migrated from Southern Arabia. There are also small communities
of Baluchis, originally from Iran or Pakistan, and Indians. The
people of the Musandam are descended from the biblical Shihu and
have their own language.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Oman, strategically situated between the Arab world
and the Orient, was a trading center for centuries with links as far
afield as China. Oil, discovered in 1964, is now the economic
mainstay although production is a modest 600,000 barrels a day. Oman
also produces dates and copper. Camel-breeding is a main crop of the
inland tribes, isolated from the coastal regions by high mountains.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY _ After the Islamic conquest, the Portuguese came to
Oman in 1597 but were thrown out by 1650. By 1730 the Omanis had
conquered Portuguese settlements in East Africa as far south as what
is now Tanzania. The British dominated from the second half of the
19th century until independence in 1951. Oman, ruled for nearly 250
years by the al-Busaid clan, was isolated from the outside world for
decades until 1970, when the British-trained Sultan Qaboos bin Said
deposed his father. With British, Jordanian and Iranian help, he
crushed a 15-year rebellion in Dhofar province by the Marxist
Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman. He revived long-dormant
links with Arab states, signed a military agreement giving the
United States base facilities in 1980 and opened diplomatic
relations with the Soviet Union in 1985.

<HEAD>Can Gorbachev Learn from China's Experience with Economic Reforms?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As Mikhail S. Gorbachev maneuvers between
conservatives and radicals to shake up the Soviet government and
economy, China's reform experience can serve as both an
encouragement and a warning to him.
   Free markets, private enterprise and incentives have tremendously
stimulated China's backward economy and for the most part ended food
shortages _ also goals of President Gorbachev.
   But a decade into its economic reforms, China faces its worst
inflation in 30 years, irrational growth patterns, provinces and
cities that ignore central directives and rampant black marketeering.
   Chinese leaders say they are at a turning point, and that only if
these problems are overcome can they proceed with more advanced
reforms in prices, wages and other areas.
   Although China and the Soviet Union have many differences,
experts from both countries say the Chinese experience can yield
lessons for Gorbachev.
   ``It is impossible for them (the Soviets) to avoid all mistakes,
they can only hope to make fewer mistakes'' than China, said Liu
Qingjian, an economist at China's Institute of Soviet and East
European Studies.
   China began its reforms in 1978, when the thrice-purged
revolutionary veteran Deng Xiaoping gained control of the Communist
Party following the death in 1976 of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
   Deng focused on reorganizing the economy _ breaking up communes
in favor of family farming, decontrolling some prices and giving
state-run factories greater autonomy.
   Only in 1987 did China begin systematic government reorganization
and make limited concessions to democracy, such as multi-candidate
balloting in party-controlled elections. Political discussion
remained tightly limited.
   Gorbachev, who rose to power on the death of President Leonid I.
Brezhnev in 1985, took the opposite approach. Unlike China, where
the political and economic chaos of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution
left many people open to change, the Soviet Union presented him with
a suspicious public as well as strong political opposition.
   Gorbachev's method has been to open Soviet society to
unprecedented, frank criticism of the status quo, while proposing
constitutional changes in the presidency and parliament that would
strengthen his hand against opponents.
   But Soviet experts at China's Institute of Soviet and East
European Studies maintained in recent interviews that Gorbachev's
glasnost, or openness, has succeeded in enthusing only a handful of
intellectuals.
   To win over ordinary Soviets, they said, Gorbachev must take a
leaf from Deng's book and offer tangible benefits.
   Most of Gorbachev's economic proposals, including leasing farm
land to families and giving factories more autonomy, have been given
only limited trials.
   ``There's too much talking and too little action,'' said
economist Liu.
   Free markets, at the heart of China's new prosperity, are
small-scale and expensive for consumers in the Soviet Union.
   A shopper in a typical Chinese city can choose from dozens of
small vendors, private and state-run, in buying a wide array of
fresh fruit and vegetables. Soviet shoppers often wait in long lines
for scant selections.
   ``If Gorbachev cannot improve the well-being of the Soviet people
... his position and his reforms will be weakened,'' said political
scientist Zhu Ruizhen.
   Deng tackled his reforms in one area at a time. He waited until
the breakup of communes had been justified by several good harvests
before making changes in the industrial sector.
   But Anton Vassiliev, an economist and first secretary at the
Soviet Embassy in Beijing, said this piecemeal approach has caused
many of China's current economic problems.
   ``This is perhaps one of the important experiences of the Chinese
reform _ that reform will bring results only if the concrete steps
in different fields are interrelated,'' Vassiliev said.
   For example, Chinese factory owners buy most of their raw
materials at prices set by supply and demand, but face state
ceilings when they sell their products. They have authority to hire
and fire but only the most rudimentary of labor markets exists.
   Dozens of Chinese provincial and city governments have been
authorized to borrow money for capital construction projects, but
bankers have no corresponding power to regulate credit.
   Market confusion, flourishing black markets and steadily rising
inflation, now officially pegged at 26 percent, are among the
results.
   Vassiliev said Moscow has put greater emphasis on planning
coordinated change in various sectors.
   China also offers a lesson in the dangers of decentralizing too
much, he said.
   Cities and provinces given special economic autonomy have
developed rapidly, but they also have duplicated projects
unnecessarily and competed for scarce raw materials, fueling
inflation.
   When Chinese leaders this fall ordered a slowdown to curb
inflation, many local governments ignored the order.
   In agriculture, too, China may have decentralized too much.
Family farming has been popular but it has hampered the introduction
of machines and high-tech methods needed to increase yields.
   The Soviet Union has no comparable special economic zones,
although some economists have proposed them. However, Gorbachev has
already witnessed reform's splintering effects, as nationalists in
the Soviet Baltic states have taken advantage of glasnost to press
for political autonomy.
   China's Soviet experts said the turmoil created by Gorbachev's
political restructuring reveals a volatility in the Soviet
population that may make later economic reforms much more difficult
than in China.
   ``The Chinese people are more obedient,'' said political
scientist Wang Qi. ``If the Soviet Union were experiencing the
(economic) problems China has now, there would be riots.''
   Both countries have a stake in each other's reforms.
   Chinese intellectuals hope that if Gorbachev's political reforms
work, it will give a push to promoters of glasnost in China.
   If China's economic programs succeed, said Vassiliev, ``it will
generally show that socialism does have potential for development
and that the problems that exist now in Soviet society can be
solved.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Tequila Sunrise''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bartenders mix a tequila sunrise from tequila, lime juice,
grenadine, orange juice and ice cubes. The drink possesses quite a
kick.
   Writer-director Robert Towne concocted ``Tequila Sunrise'' out of
three high-powered stars, a romantic triangle, lush Los Angeles
settings and cop-versus-drug dealers intrigue. The result is
surprisingly flat.
   The movie opens with Mel Gibson escaping from a police trap
during a drug transaction in an east side motel. Gibson has a
drug-dealing past, but he claims to have been an innocent
participant in the motel deal (innocent?), and insists he's retired
from the business.
   His old high school and surfing buddy, Kurt Russell, doesn't
think so. Russell is a narcotics cop, and he'll nail Gibson any way
he can. That includes luring into bed Michelle Pfeiffer, a
restaurant owner he suspects is involved professionally and
personally with Gibson.
   Gibson's former associates don't want him to quit, especially the
bigtime operator from Mexico, Raul Julia, posing as a top government
crime fighter. Gibson finds himself besieged by the ruthless Julia
on one side and Russell as well as unprincipled federal agents on
the other. In the meantime he manages to conduct his own romance
with Pfeiffer.
   ``Tequila Sunrise'' is a curiosity: an action adventure without
action. Except from the opening chase and the final waterfront
shootout, it's mostly talk. Lots of soul-searching, philosophizing,
hunting for motives. Director Towne seems to be overwhelmed by
writer Towne's words. The audience is not.
   The actors do their best with muddled characterizations. Gibson
remains the most watchable of young leading men, but he needs help
from a workable script. Russell, almost unrecognizable with his hair
slicked back, does nicely as the unscrupulous cop. Pfeiffer is
gorgeous as ever.
   The ethics of ``Tequila Sunrise'' are questionable. The
attractive Gibson is the sympathetic figure, and he exhibits no
remorse for helping to ruin lives by hustling dope. Is such a
portrayal acceptable in a ``Just Say No'' society?
   Thom Mount was producer of the Warner Bros. release, which is
rated R for language, drug use and sexual content. Running time: 116
minutes.
   A final word about the title. It appears to have nothing to do
with the movie, except that in one brief scene Gibson is seen with
an orangey-looking drink in his hand.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Stand and Deliver,'' ``Vampire at
Midnight,'' ``Bad Dreams,'' ``Call Me''
   
   ``Stand and Deliver'' (Warner Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated
PG)
   
   The first thing one needs to know about ``Stand and Deliver'' is
that it is a true story. Because if one didn't know in advance that
it really happened, some of the events in this film might be hard to
swallow.
   The setting is Garfield High, a school in poor and heavily
Hispanic East Los Angeles on the brink of losing its academic
accreditation. Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos) shows up one day
as the new computer science teacher. He is told the computers never
arrived and is shunted off to teach basic math.
   Undaunted, Escalante walks into the classroom and announces to
the unruly and apathetic students: ``Knowing math will only get you
a job at a taco stand. I will teach you algebra.'' And so he does.
Cajoling, badgering, bullying, humoring, Escalante gives these
11th-graders, many of whom don't even know their multiplication
tables, a reason to try harder.
   And harder. And harder. Because as soon as he teaches them
algebra, Escalante decides he wants to teach them calculus in their
senior year. With calculus, he tells his incredulous colleagues,
they will be able to take the Advanced Math Placement Test and gain
college credit. It's a ticket to scholarships, to a world heretofore
unattainable to these barrio kids.
   The 18 students take the rigorous course and pass the Advanced
Placement Test with flying colors. And here's where the movie gets
really interesting _ the Educational Testing Service decides that
the scores are so high that the students must have cheated, and
invalidates them. As Escalante says, the world that the students
have worked so hard to become a part of turns out to be not worthy
of them. The students decide to take the test again _ to stand and
deliver.
   Olmos gives a riveting performance as the dogged Escalante, a
mumbling, funny, believably rumpled teacher. Kudos to the casting
directors who chose the balding, acne-scarred Olmos over a flashier
screen-idol type. Of the students, the only actor with name
recognition is ``La Bamba'' star Lou Diamond Phillips, who plays a
hood afraid to look too brainy.
   The film was directed by Ramon Menendez, who co-wrote the
screenplay with producer Tom Musca. Although simplistic at times,
``Stand and Deliver'' should be heralded for letting the story line
stand and deliver and not succumb to schmaltz.

   ``Vampire at Midnight'' (Key Video; VHS-Beta, $79.98; Rated R)
   
   Want a GREAT idea for a STUPID movie?
   Take Svengali and Trilby, right? And make him a VAMPIRE SERIAL
KILLER and make her a, um, let's see ... make her a, um, this,
REALLY BUILT CONCERT PIANIST, that's it! With a mental block, right?
   Only there's this WISE-CRACKING REBEL COP, you know, with a crush
on her, who like WASTES a couple of nasty armed robbers in the first
scene ... KABLOOIE! ... you know, to establish his character. So a
bunch of people get SLASHED and STABBED and OTHERWISE WASTED and
BLOOD-SUCKED, you know, and PLUS, get this, there's a couple of
naughty scenes with bare breasts to like set up this ENORMOUS
PSYCHOLOGICAL TENSION, right? And then the Svengali guy goes to make
her his topless bride and the cop gets bushwhacked but in like, the
next-to next-to last scene ... KABLOOIE!!!
   For the record, this sociopathic yawn stars the wooden Jason
Williams, an actor. It's from an idea by Jason Williams, and the
screenplay is co-written by Jason Williams. It was directed by
Gregory McClatchey. And, oh, yeah, it's close-captioned for
hearing-impaired viewers.

   ``Bad Dreams'' (CBS-Fox Video; VHS-Beta, $89.98; Rated R)
   
   ``Bad Dreams'' is a chilling horror tale for grownups, starring
Jennifer Rubin as Cynthia, sole survivor of a Jonestown-like mass
immolation. When she awakens from a 13-year coma, the ghost of
messianic cult leader Harris (Richard Lynch) wants her back. He
calls to her; she can't refuse.
   Question if you must the logic of easing her into the 1980s by
feeding her psychotropic drugs and locking her in a psychiatric
clinic with a bunch of emotionally disturbed people _ but hey, this
is the '80s, right?
   Director Andrew Fleming (who co-wrote with Steven de Souza) has a
great cast, including Susan Ruttan (``L.A. Law'') as a bitter
neurotic and Dean Cameron, whose glib, mellow, self-destructive
LA-style psycho is worth the price of the rental. Special honors to
Michele Burke's gory makeup.
   Alexandr Gruszynski's brilliant cinematography narrative neatly
wanders the hallucinary borderline of fantasy and reality as one by
one Cynthia's fellow patients die off. Is Harris killing them?
   ``Bad Dreams'' takes a great premise and fulfills its
possibilities. Its splash and spatter, while minimal, would be too
much for the squeamish. Still, this movie proves again that
humanity's ideas are still the scariest thing about it.

   ``Call Me'' (Vestron Video; VHS, $79.98; Rated R)
   
   Anna works for a downtown newspaper similar to the Village Voice.
She lives in an expansive loft in Brooklyn where she profiled a
sleazy neighborhood gin mill called the Polish Bar.
   One night she gets an obscene phone call from a man she presumes
to be her wimpy, narcissistic boyfriend who's as sexy and sensual as
sunbaked cement. He breathily asks her to meet him at the Polish
Bar, in sexy heels, leather skirt sans undies. Idiot that she is,
she goes.
   Needless to say, it was not Mr. Wonderful. And once this idiot
woman calls and discovers her boyfriend home and in bed she rushes
to the ladies room instead of rushing home. There she is witness to
the brutal slaying of a transvestite by a vicious crooked cop.
   From here on the movie adapts a lackluster thriller mode with a
stop or two at erotica. Of special note to citrus fans: Anna does
curious things with an orange.
   Patricia Charbonneau, who gave a nice off-beat performance as the
lesbian in ``Desert Hearts,'' is rather limp here but that probably
has more to do with the script by Karen Kay and Sollace Mitchell,
who also directed. It's a good idea that doesn't have enough iron to
give it that harder edge.

   ``Every Dog Has His Day'' (IRS) _ Let's Active
   
   We promise, Mitch. If you go back to doing what you do best,
we'll never use the word ``jangly'' in a Let's Active review again.
   Much to Mitch Easter's chagrin, his band has always been lumped
with the ``jangly guitar'' groups that followed in the wake of
underground faves R.E.M. Easter, who produced R.E.M.'s first few
albums, has tried to carve an identity for his own band since its
bright, tuneful debut in 1983.
   Unfortunately, he's done it lately by turning Let's Active into
Lead Active. The self-conscious effort at hardening the band's sound
turns the promising ``Every Dog Has His Day'' into a disappointment.
   It's not that Let's Active can't rock out _ the title tune is
quite successful. It's just that Easter's high-pitched, nasal voice
and intriguing melodic sense tends to drown in a sea of metallic
shards. Most of the hard rockers here, such as the thrashing ``Ten
Layers Down'' or ``Too Bad,'' are simply uninteresting.
   The album's two best songs are comparatively quiet and performed
by guitarist Angie Carlson. ``Mr. Fool'' is intricately beautiful
and ``Forty Years'' shows a country flavor by this North Carolina
band.
   Easter seems intent on erasing an image problem in his mind and
he's succeeded.
   But at what cost?

   ``Pattern Disruptive'' (Epic) _ The Dickey Betts Band
   
   ``Pattern Disruptive'' features the first new music from former
Allman Brothers guitarist Dickey Betts since 1981. It's remarkable,
then, that the record contains not one fresh idea. Betts clings to
the 1970s Southern rock formula with a passion that, alas, is
missing from his singing and playing.
   The one cut that makes ``Pattern Disruptive'' worth hearing is
the instrumental ``Duane's Tune.'' The flashy guitar work and a
complex melody make for a quick six minutes of music. The tune is up
to the standards of such Allman Brothers instrumentals as
``Jessica'' and ``In Memory of Elizabeth Reed,'' which Betts also
wrote.
   Much of the rest of the album is pale blues. Betts and fellow
guitarist Warren Haynes offer a few lively breaks, usually in
tandem, but a lot of their riffs are as hackneyed as heavy metal.
And the singers and rhythm section sound as bored by the material as
the audience is sure to be.
   Next time, Betts should try an album of instrumentals. At least
that formula is a winner.

   ``Buenos Noches From A Lonely Room'' (Reprise) _ Dwight Yoakam
   
   Yeah, I know. A lot of people don't seem to like Dwight Yoakam.
He has that nasal twang, he wears silly skintight pants, and his
self-proclaimed ``hillbilly music'' seems a mite contrived to some
people.
   Yoakam's first two albums may be partly to blame. ``Guitars,
Cadillacs, Etc.'' and ``Hillbilly Deluxe'' were promising _ after
all, no one had heard much like this lately _ but he still sounded
calculating as well as creative.
   But not here. No sir. ``Buenos Noches From a Lonely Room'' is a
genuinely brilliant record, 11 songs that sound like Dwight Yoakam
sat down and invented country music all by himself.
   He didn't, of course. Yoakam is well aware of where he comes
from, and he again pays homage to old masters. His anthemic
rendition of the Buck Owens classic, ``Streets of Bakersfield,'' a
duet with Owens himself, is the finest track on the album, a
rousing, full-throttle synopsis of what country music is all about.
   And the rest of ``Buenos Noches'' is fine as well, from the
funereal ``I Sang Dixie,'' one of seven Yoakam originals here, to
the semi-obscure Johnny Cash cover ``Home of the Blues'' and a
pretty duet with Lone Justice's Maria McKee on Roy Acuff's ``Send Me
the Pillow.''
   With this album, Dwight Yoakam has hit his stride, his singing
fluid and powerful, his sound his own. Forget the permanent scowl
and the silly pants. This is great stuff. This is for real.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Bill Murray Remains Off the Wall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the history of American entertainment in
the 1970s and '80s is written, a hefty chapter will be required for
``Saturday Night Live.''
   NBC's off-the-wall comedy series has produced almost as many
stars as did vaudeville in an earlier era, including: John Belushi,
Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin,
Albert Brooks, Laraine Newman, Joe Piscopo, Eddie Murphy, Brad Hall,
Jim Belushi, Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, Rich Hall and Martin
Short.
   Murray has warm memories of his service (1977-80) with the Not
Ready for Prime Time Players:
   ``The most fun we had was when it was just us. After 6 o'clock on
Friday night, everyone would leave the building (RCA in Rockefeller
Plaza, New York). We wouldn't have hangers-on or guests or visitors.
It would just be the actors and the crew.
   ``That was fun that nobody else could have,'' he said. ``We're
the only ones who know what it was really like. From 6 o'clock to 11
o'clock, it was just work, execution and learning something. It was
one of the greatest schools anyone could ever have. Anyone who had
that job for more than six months can do anything. It was incredible
training.
   ``We all got goofy, but everybody gets goofy. We were in the
business of making funny television, hopefully. When you did it
right, that was more satisfying that getting drunk or throwing
bottles out of windows or whatever anyone says we may have done.''
   Many of the tricks Murray learned on ``Saturday Night Live'' can
be viewed in ``Scrooged,'' new from Paramount Pictures. It's an
update of ``A Christmas Carol'' with Murray as a TV network boss who
would make Scrooge seem like Mother Teresa. Most of the critics
didn't enjoy the movie, but the public did. The first weekend take
was a massive $13 million on 1,262 screens.
   Why another version of Dickens' oft-told tale?
   ``The incentive was to make a funny version of `A Christmas
Carol,' to give it a modern look and a 1980s social conscience,''
Murray said. ``Besides I wanted to work. I like to work. I'm a
better person when I work. It was better that I get a job; I was
deteriorating rapidly.''
   Of course, one never knows how seriously to take Murray's
remarks. It is true that he took a long breather after the megahit
``Ghostbusters'' and his dramatic mishap, ``The Razor's Edge.''
   What did he do on his vacation?
   ``Well, I was over in Paris for a while,'' he said. ``I studied a
little bit at the Sorbonne. I learned how to eat with a fork and
knife. They're really very good with a fork and knife over there in
France. They can eat anything with a knife and fork. They prefer to
eat yogurt with a knife and fork.
   ``They're much better than the English or the Dutch with
silverware. Every American should go to France to learn how to use
silverware. They've got something going there. I don't think even
the French know what they've got.
   ``The silverware thing is pretty much it for my vacation,'' he
quipped. ``There weren't any good scripts. They were all pretty
scary. You get lazy. Your momentum drops and you get so you can
barely leave the house.
   ``You get lazier and lazier. When I did `Scrooged,' it took me
weeks to get back into it. I wasn't really sharp at all. Usually,
just before lunch there's a big shot, and they like to get it. For
two or three weeks, I blew the take just before lunch and they said,
`That's OK, Bill, let's go eat; maybe that will help.' I wasn't
amusing anybody for a weeks.''
   Murray grew up in a funny family in Wilmette, Ill., near Chicago.
He was the middle of nine children who, according to family legend,
vied for the attention of their father, a lumber salesman with a
rare sense of humor. He continued trying to make his fellow students
laugh while attending a Jesuit school. After a brief stint at a
pre-med school in Denver, he drifted back to Chicago.
   His older brother, Brian, had joined Second City, the
improvisational comedy troupe that included John Belushi and Harold
Ramis. Murray studied at the company's workshop, then replaced
Belushi who moved on to New York. The Murray brothers and Ramis
followed soon afterward. Then came the explosion of ``Saturday Night
Live.''
   Murray's fresh, laid-back comedic style attracted movie interest,
and his first starring role was in Ivan Reitman's summer-camp
comedy, ``Meatballs.'' He bombed in ``Where the Buffalo Roam,'' a
mistaken attempt to capture gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in a
movie. Then came another Reitman romp, ``Stripes,'' followed by
``Ghostbusters.''
   In 1989, the ``Ghostbuster'' gang returns for the long-awaited
sequel.
   ```Ghostbusters' was the most fun we ever had making a movie,''
said Murray. ``It was just funny people doing a funny movie. Even
though there was a lot of waiting because of the special effects, we
really had a lot of fun. I've known these guys (Aykroyd, Ramis,
Reitman) for a long time. We laughed a lot.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Glasnost Gives America Celebrated Pianist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The day before Vladimir Horowitz performed in
Moscow two years ago, Philipp Viardo played the middle movement of a
Mozart sonata as a sound check for the TV cameras.
   After the concert, Vladimir and Natalia Viardo were introduced to
Horowitz as the parents of Philipp, who was then 9.
   But for everybody else, Vladimir Viardo is a symbol of
``glasnost.'' He's the first Soviet musician to receive permission
to live in the United States, to have his family join him and to
retain his Soviet citizenship.
   At 23, Viardo won the 1973 Van Cliburn International Piano
Competition in Fort Worth, the only Russian who has won it. He
toured, with much acclaim, in the United States and Mexico in 1974
and '75 then wasn't allowed to return until 1988. He now has been
given permission to live in Texas and pursue his career for two
years. Natalia Viardo, a former teacher, was to bring back sons
Philipp, 11, and Alexander, 4, this month.
   The Soviet concert bureau already had fixed about 25 appearances
for the 39-year-old Viardo. Ten U.S. solo recitals are scheduled for
April.
   ``The next year is completely free. I hope it will be full. I
want to compensate,'' he said.
   He said the desire to stay in the United States came in a flash.
``I was driving in a car with a friend in Texas. I thought, `I'm
missing a chance _ to play concerts, meet people, attend concerts.
Why should I?'''
   Viardo said the reason he can stay is ``glasnost.'' It also is
timing. When pianist Vladimir Feltsman received permission to leave
the Soviet Union last year, Viardo said Feltsman stayed two months,
applying for an open visa that would allow him to return. When that
was denied, he left and now lives with his wife and son in New York.
   ``He didn't want to leave forever. Russian nostalgia is a very
famous thing,'' Viardo said.
   After deciding he wanted to stay here, Viardo wrote a letter
explaining ``the practical and creative music reasons'' to the
Soviet ambassador in Washington. After ``three very nervous weeks,''
the Viardos were invited to talk with the Soviet consul general in
New York. Three weeks later he called them in again and said Moscow
had given the green light.
   He has ``seven bloods,'' including Jewish, gypsy, Russian and
Polish _ ``it's borscht,'' Viardo says, and his wife, whose brother
lives in Chicago, is Jewish.
   Viardo thought about leaving the Soviet Union forever during the
13 years he wasn't allowed to visit the United States. ``I couldn't.
I had a strong connection with my teachers and friends,'' he said.
   ``I was bitter. There was psychological torture. This is the age
when I had to establish myself; it was very important in my life.''
   He said that his touring to the West ``just stopped without any
explanation. I don't know what I've done. Maybe once somebody didn't
like my face.''
   Asked if he was treated fairly in those 13 years, he said, ``I
don't connect too much musical things to money. Certainly, they paid
me for concerts. If you consider salary for workers, I was paid
more. If you consider people who came abroad, it was much less.
   ``I was allowed to play big halls and with any orchestra. I
learned my repertoire from six concertos to 35.
   ``It is miraculous I was not broken down psychologically in those
years,'' he said. ``In the Russian language musician means executor.
Somebody else creates the music and we execute it. It puts in the
minds of officials we are not creative.''
   Viardo was allowed to give concerts only inside the Soviet Union
from 1976 to '80. For the next seven years, he could perform also in
Eastern Europe. In 1987 France, Germany and Denmark were added and
in 1988, America.
   Viardo hasn't yet decided what he'll play in his upcoming U.S.
concerts.
   ``As a grown-up artist I have a taste to play one name _ an
all-Chopin recital,'' he said. ``As a very young pianist for the
United States, I must show I can play different styles. I want to
show something like some Shostakovich which was never played in this
country.''
   His new position may put pressure on him, but Viardo said he's
ready.
   ``I don't make political noise to bring attention to me, because
I think it is not very good for a musician. I believe it should be
strictly music,'' he said.
   But he sees classical music as ``softening spirits in a political
world.''
   ``In 1974, after some concert, somebody came to me and said, `I
cannot shoot in such a world like you.' If I play well and soften
his heart, he cannot shoot at me. It really can work in a political
way.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Down to Earth With Hits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robbie Nevil held a up picture of himself, smiled
and said, ``Nice guy, real down to earth.''
   But Nevil, who made his mark on the music business in 1986 with
``C'est La Vie,'' seems ready to take off at any moment.
   ``There's an energy that comes across. I do love it,'' said
Nevil, who has released his second album, ``A Place Like This.''
   ``I like to do what I do for a living, how many people can say
that?''
   Nevil recently talked about his career in a recent interview at
offices of his record label, EMI. He is animated in conversation,
peppering his observations with renditions of songs, and doing an
inspired impersonation of his idol, Stevie Wonder.
   ``I don't take myself too seriously,'' he said. ``I don't think
I'm better or worse than anybody else, really. I like music and play
guitar. I've been very lucky and I'm making the music I want without
compromising on any level.
   ``I'm having a good time.''
   Nevil grew up in Los Angeles in the 1970s. Show business was in
his blood.
   ``My mom used to play classical piano. My father was a child
actor, he was Junior on the Dick Tracy radio show. My younger
brother's an actor.''
   So Nevil didn't take long to decide he wanted to be a musician.
   ``Maybe not when I was five, but by the time I was 11 I started
to play guitar,'' he said. ``From that point I started working at
it. I believe in getting good at what I do. A lot of people are
better than me, but that makes you push harder. I believe in setting
my goals high.''
   Nevil also began singing early. ``I remember singing in grade
school. I used to love singing loud, that feeling of power. This
principal heard me sing; she just picked me out and at graduation I
sang `Lavender Blue.'''
   He worked at a stationery store and then a delicatessen. But he
kept on writing songs and five years ago, composed ``C'est La Vie.''
He had no idea it would be such a major hit.
   ``I wasn't thinking that was the first single, but everybody
seemed to react to that. It's strong, immediate and fun. The sound
had its own distinct style.''
   Despite the success of ``C'est La Vie,'' he decided not to tour
in support of his self-titled debut album. ``I had to go to Japan
many times for promotion. You can't really do that if you're on the
road.''
   But now he's anxious to play live.
   ``I want to get a chance to get to know the fans,'' said Nevil,
who will start touring in March. ``This time, even though I'm more
than a name, I want to start small, just nightclub gigs.''
   Nevil admits to having some jitters about touring, but considers
that an asset.
   ``It's a healthy nervous about wanting to make it good, to have
the best players so I can have fun with it,'' he said. ``I think
people are going to see the show and get a sense of the band. George
Michael tends to be more of a solo artist and the band backs him
up.''
   Michael's name popped up frequently. Not only does Nevil admire
his singing, but Michael's producer, Chris Porter, worked
extensively on ``A Place Like This.''
   ``His attitude was so great. He didn't just say, `I do this.' If
I had to go into a studio and make a record with no effects, I'd
choose him. He doesn't need the effects that a lot of new cats need.
Their stuff is great but without processing they'd be lost.''
   Nevil confesses to a little processing himself, but says that ``A
Place Like This'' is a fairly simple production.
   ``I used punched-in vocals on the first album, but this album has
a lot less going on. I went for more performance,'' he said. ``I
loved the last album, but this album is a new face. Here I am, if
you like it. If you don't, well, this is what I do.''
   And what he does, sells. Nevil is well informed on how to write
hits, and talked about ``Back on Holiday,'' his new single.
   ``I think it was a good choice for a first single because it was
very sonically hard-hitting. It doesn't take long to get to the
point. It's not the kind of song you have to hear five times.''
   Does Nevil really think about writing hit singles?
   ``I think to say no would be a lie,'' he said. ``If I have a
groove and it's catchy, I'd be a fool to write something weird in
the middle. I like to think what makes it feel good. I think of it
as a single in wanting to make sure it's watertight.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Biographer's Dilemma is a Reader's Delight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The truth about Lorin Jones is that the late
artist refuses to fit the feminist pigeonhole into which Polly Alter
tries to wedge her.
   The truth about Alison Lurie, the author of ``The Truth About
Lorin Jones,'' is that she resists pigeonholing just as formidably.
   ``The Truth About Lorin Jones'' ($18.95, Little, Brown) the
Pulitzer Prize-winning author's eighth novel, is about the vagaries
of researching a biography, the hypocisy of certain types of
feminism and the tenacity of one Polly Alter, Lurie's protagonist.
This charming book borrows a little from the detective genre and a
lot from gentle satire.
   Polly, a born-again feminist whose marriage has just dissolved,
decides to write the biography of Lorin Jones, an artist who made a
big splash in the 1950s but died a virtual unknown in 1969. Polly,
an art historian, has made up her mind before she begins the project
that the men in Lorin Jones' life destroyed her. But her perception
of the elusive artist shifts with every interview _ Lorin Jones'
half-brother, art dealer, husband, last lover all tell conflicting
tales. All, of course, paint themselves in the most flattering light
while castigating the others.
   As Polly tries to ferret out the truth, her personal life is
turned upside down by a lesbian experiment with her roommate.
Between the two experiences _ writing the biography and negotiating
with her roommate and her roommate's other lover _ she learns that
men are not all bad and women are not all good.
   In a recent interview in New York, Lurie was asked where she got
the idea for Polly Alter.
   ``She's based on a lot of people I've known _ former students,
young faculty,'' the author said. ``The problems, the concerns of
women of that generation are very different from the concerns of
women of my generation.'' (Polly is in her 30s; Lurie is 62.)
   ``She represents women who have grown up into feminism. ... I
know women who have had a bad experience with a man who come to me
and say, `I wish I was a lesbian. My best friends are all women, I
trust them and understand them. The problem is I'm just not
physically attracted to them.' Some of them will try to become
lesbians, but there's a very small proportion of women to which
lesbianism is natural.''
   Lurie, herself a feminist, is aware that some feminists may
object to the unflattering portraits of many of the female
characters. Has there been a feminist backlash?
   ``I haven't had any feminists say, `You are a bad guy and I spit
upon you' _ or even milder versions of that _ but I have begun to
have communications from men who are, let us say, very suspicious of
feminism, uncomfortable with it, who are congratulating me. And it
makes me feel that I haven't made myself clear _ that my sympathy
for Jeanne, or even Betsy, that poor girl (Polly's lesbian roommate
and her lover) hasn't come over,'' the author said.
   Lurie is a longtime resident of Ithaca, N.Y., where she teaches
writing, folklore and children's literature at Cornell University.
She teaches only during the fall and spends the rest of the year
writing fiction, dividing her time between upstate New York, Key
West, Fla., and London.
   The writer first made a name for herself with her fourth novel,
``The War Between the Tates,'' published in 1974. She won a Pulitzer
a decade later with ``Foreign Affairs.''
   But just as the fictional Lorin Jones resists easy typecasting,
so does her creator. Lurie was asked if she is happy with critics'
label of her as a ``satirical writer.''
   ``Oh, you know people are going to label you,'' she said. ``If I
wasn't a `satirical writer,' I'd be a `sensational writer' or a
`romantic writer.'''
   Well then, would she rather be ``wry and amusing'' or known for
your ``mordant wit?''
   ``I think in this society women are expected to be sweeter and
nicer than men. And I think if I were a man and had written these
books people wouldn't be making so much of my `mordant wit.' Men are
expected to take a cooler look at the world,'' she said.
   She also balked at reviews that hailed her as a modern-day Henry
James or Edith Wharton after the publication of ``Foreign Affairs.''
   ``I've been compared to James because I wrote about Americans in
Europe (`Foreign Affairs'),'' she said. ``A critic is always going
to make parallels.''
   Since she does not write while teaching, she is not working on
any novels now.
   ``If I thought about it too much I would become impatient, and
when I saw a stack of papers (to grade) I would feel interrupted. So
I try to put it aside,'' she said. ``Sometimes it works better _ the
work goes on underground even when you're not thinking about it.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Banjo Not Just For Bluegrass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CONNIE CASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The banjo, an instrument that traveled to
America with African slaves, has captured the imagination of pickers
with dozens of playing styles who perform almost every type of music.
   ``Somebody who's a non-banjo player might think all banjo playing
is alike,'' said Art Rosenbaum, who researches banjo music. ``But
there's so much way to express your individuality through banjo.''
   Banjo performers today range from Snuffy Jenkins, who learned his
three-finger picking style in the 1920s, to Tony Trischka, who has
teamed the banjo with symphony orchestras and electronic
synthesizers.
   Elements of bluegrass are combined with rock 'n' roll, jazz and
classical music on the three albums by Trischka. He has performed in
tuxedo with a symphony orchestra.
   ``A lot of people were kind of like bent out of shape about it.
They said, `You can't do that with the banjo.' I just want to get
into as much of the banjo as I can explore,'' Trischka said.
   ``The instrument itself has evolved and playing styles have
evolved,'' said Rosenbaum, a picker who has uses his research on the
instrument and folk traditions in radio shows and books. Rosenbaum
joined more than 150 other players at a series of workshops in
Lebanon this fall.
   The first banjos were crafted from gourds in Africa, he said.
Later in America they were made with a wooden frame and animal hide
stretched across the head.
   ``They used to be made of cat skin in the old days and they used
catgut for strings,'' Rosenbaum said. ``They say that when someone
wanted a banjo they would just go out and kill a cat, and in two
hours they would be playing a tune on it.''
   Some of the earliest banjo performances were 19th century
minstrel shows, where white performers mimicked the banjo playing of
blacks and painted their faces with black makeup.
   Some people still play in the tradition of the minstrels, and
from that style grew the classic banjo practiced today by British
recording artist Chris Sands and others. Sands plays ragtime and
also arranges the music of Bach, Handel and Chopin for the banjo.
   ``A friend of mine says, `Nothing ever disappears.' I guess
that's kind of true with the banjo,'' Rosenbaum said.
   ``Old-time'' banjo playing remains popular, including the
``clawhammer'' style, a rhythmic method of striking downward on the
strings that was revived during the folk craze of the '60s, he said.
   Today's bluegrass relies heavily on three-finger picking made
famous in the '50s by the father of bluegrass banjo, Earl Scruggs,
as a member of the Foggy Mountain Boys.
   Scruggs' style evolved from three-finger picking first put on the
radio by Jenkins in 1934. Jenkins continues to perform the folk
tunes he learned as a boy, although he says playing is more
difficult at age 80.
   ``I can't feel the strings anymore,'' he said. ``It makes my
heart sick at my stomach to see other guys picking and want to but I
can't.''
   Jenkins says he didn't invent three-finger picking, and he
doesn't consider himself a bluegrass player: ``I don't claim to be a
bluegrass picker because that term came out after me, and I'm too
old to change. I don't think it's (bluegrass) that different, it's
just the old-time music speeded up.''
   Traditional bluegrass, epitomized by the Foggy Mountain Boys'
tune, ``Foggy Mountain Breakdown,'' and often thought of as
hillbilly music, is by far the most popular banjo style, said Janet
Deering, co-owner of Deering Banjo Co. in Lemon Grove, Calif.
   Only about 10 percent of U.S. banjo pickers play the four-string
banjos used primarily for dixieland jazz, she said. Most banjos have
five strings.
   Deering estimates that about 2,000 banjos costing from $500 to
thousands of dollars are made in the United States each year.
Hundreds more, mostly less expensive, are imported.
   No statistics on the number of banjos or banjo players are kept,
she said.
   ``I would guess, compared to guitar players, you'd have one banjo
player to every 100 guitar players,'' Deering said. ``But there are
millions playing the guitar.''
   A growing number of musicians are experimenting with new
directions for the banjo, and Deering's company began making an
electric banjo about 1{ years ago and 100 have been sold.

   Lionel Aldridge, a 6-foot-4, 225-pound former
Green Bay Packer, was afraid to go home. He believed his wife was a
witch.
   Once part of NBC's television sportscasting team, Aldridge was
driven from job to job in city after city by imaginary voices. He
now sorts mail on the 3:30 p.m. to midnight shift in Milwaukee.
   Schizophrenia cost him a career, a marriage and ``just about
every person I had in my life at that time.''
   ``I figure,'' he said recently, ``it cost me everything.''
   Such are the stakes in schizophrenia.
   That's why research advances, such as the recent evidence that a
single gene may cause some cases, are more than just nifty bits of
science. They are another step in understanding a devastating
disease that strikes perhaps one in every 100 people at some point
in their lives.
   Schizophrenia usually begins with an apparent personality change
that may include social withdrawal, difficulty in communicating and
lethargy. Later, in its more active phase, it can make victims see
hallucinations and hear voices.
   They may feel controlled by invisible agents or believe their
thoughts are being broadcast to others. They may adopt new
identities.
   Nobody knows what causes the disease, a key question in finding
better treatments. Aldridge said the gene discovery is ``just the
tip of the iceberg'' toward finding a cause.
   Scientists have long suspected an inherited influence, and the
new study provided biological evidence for a gene in a few families.
But that gene has been shown not to be a factor in other families,
supporting the longstanding suspicion of multiple factors, perhaps
environmental and genetic.
   The voices and hallucinations are gone now for Aldridge, 47,
thanks to daily medication that keeps his illness at bay. ``I'm
enjoying relatively good health now,'' he said, but ``nothing is
guaranteed me'' for the future.
   For the Louisiana native, the schizophrenia battle began after
his athletic career. He played defensive end for the Packers and was
part of the most famous defensive line in National Football League
history when the team won three straight NFL championships and the
first two Super Bowls.
   He was traded to the San Diego Chargers in 1971 and retired from
pro ball after two seasons, taking up radio and TV sportscasting in
Milwaukee. NBC used him as an analyst for several seasons, including
its 1977 Super Bowl coverage.
   But the first signs of trouble had already appeared in early
1974. He had trouble concentrating. He couldn't get his work done on
time, and as a result his broadcasts often ran shorter than planned.
   ``I became very suspicious of people, especially the people I
worked with. The workplace became very difficult, a very unhappy
place.''
   Aldridge sought psychotherapy. But later that year, he began to
have bouts of psychosis, with imaginary voices and hallucinations.
   ``It was like suddenly discovering another world ... one that had
been here all along, one that was totally foreign and frightening.''
   While his behavior on the air appeared normal, his life at other
times was bizarre. He feared that his wife was a witch. He ran
barefoot through the snow in search of his therapist.
   Soon, he was hospitalized. ``I knew I needed help,'' he said. But
the medication he received for a couple years ``zombied me out so
bad I couldn't work.'' He had to work, so he gave up the medication.
   He continued to fight the voices that told him to quit his job
and leave town, and that nobody liked him. He battled the delusions
that the station was underground, that he had to hide from others
and watch out for himself.
   ``That was the existence I chose because I wouldn't take the
medication, because I figured I could take care of myself.''
   In 1981 he took a leave of absence from his job. ``I simply could
not do it any more,'' he said. His wife had already filed for
divorce.
   He left Milwaukee and traveled the country for as long as his
money held out, then he sold the car and continued by bus and train.
Within a few months of leaving town, he was living on the streets.
   But he found some respectable jobs: sports director at a
Louisiana radio station, prison counselor, football coach at a high
school and a college.
   ``I could keep myself straight during the interview,'' he
recalled, and when the employers found out who he was, they were
happy to hire him.
   But ``the voices ... wouldn't let me stay anyplace for any length
of time,'' he said. One by one, he left his jobs or was let go.
   In 1984 he found himself back in a Milwaukee hospital, thanks to
friends alarmed by his behavior. The doctors talked about medicine
again, and Aldridge figured he would give it a try. ``I had nothing
to stay straight for on the outside,'' so being ``zombied out''
would not be a problem, he reasoned.
   So it went for about three months. But then his doctor cut the
dose until Aldridge was taking just enough medication to keep the
voices and hallucinations away while avoiding the side effect.
   In late 1984 he left the hospital for a nursing home, then went
on to his own apartment. He started work at the post office in 1985,
and apart from a brief interruption, he has been there since. Now
Aldridge speaks publicly about schizophrenia, hoping to encourage
research. He was recently honored for his efforts by the National
Mental Health Association.
   Looking back at what schizophrenia cost him, he said, ``I'm
trying to find out what good it brought.
   ``It brought me the ability to travel around the country and talk
to people about it. It made me stronger in some ways ...
   ``It made me comfortable in situations where I was uncomfortable
before. I can't think of any situation where I can be intimidated,
because the worst has already happened. How much more can you lose
than everything?''

<HEAD>Patients Sick Of Waiting For Doctor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leon Johnson had a bruised chest when he went
to see the doctor, but waiting two hours for treatment made him sick
to his stomach.
   ``I finally did get treated by the doctor, but I was so upset by
the time he was through I didn't care whether it hurt or not. I just
told him off,'' said Johnson, 74, of Oakhurst, Calif.
   ``He was too busy for me and I didn't need his services that bad.
It is particularly frustrating to some of us senior citizens who
don't have that much time left to wait.''
   In the face of increasing competition, some doctors and dentists
are becoming more concerned about time-conscious patients like
Johnson and are taking a cue from hard-driving executives on how to
manage time.
   ``People have become more sensitized to the consumer age and
realize that patients aren't going to wait. They're going to go
somewhere else,'' said Mark Samuels, a dentist who teaches practice
administration at the University of Pittsburgh's dental school.
   To determine how long patients wait, time management expert
Michael Fortino recently kept track of how much time 350 patients
spent in the waiting rooms of 75 general practitioners and 90
dentists in the Pittsburgh area.
   Fortino881; March 3, 1901; March 10, 1922; June 8, 1934; and June 28,
1966.
   A great quake like the one Jackson believes is possible would
rupture the fault well into Southern California, and could kill
14,000 people, hospitalize 55,000 and cause $17 billion damage,
according to a 1980 federal report.

<HEAD>Study Indicates Mothers Of Deformed Babies Cuddle Less</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mothers of babies with severe head and
facial deformities cuddle and smile at them less than those with
normal infants, but claim greater satisfaction from parenthood, a
new study suggests.
   The researchers made 18-minute videotapes of 10 mothers and their
4-month-old babies, five of whom were normal and five of whom
suffered from disorders producing serious deformities but no
neurological or mental deficiencies. The infants were matched in
terms of age, sex, birth order _ all first-born _ ethnic status, and
the mother's age, marital status and education.
   The sessions included 10 minutes of play, five minutes in which
the mothers tried to get their babies to vocalize, and three minutes
of babies face-to-face with their mothers, who had to imitate the
babies' expressions and actions.
   Mothers of deformed babies touched them a fifth as much as
mothers of normal infants, spent a third as much time demonstrating
toys to them, and smiled or laughed at them half has much, said R.
Christopher Barden, a University of Utah psychologist who directed
the study.
   In turn, the deformed infants touched their mothers and smiled or
laughed at them a fourth as much as the normal babies, cried more
than twice as much, and responded to their mother's voice a fifth as
much, Barden found.
   The mothers of deformed children, however, claimed greater
satisfaction with parenthood, suggesting they ``are either unwilling
to admit or unaware of the difficulties and stress imposed by their
deformed child,'' he said.
   Braden collaborated with Martin E. Ford of Stanford University
and Kenneth Salyer, Marcy Rogers-Salyer and Gayle Jensen of the
International Craniofacial Institute and the National Craniofacial
Foundation.

<HEAD>Ferret Biologists Working On Canine Distemper Vaccine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wildlife researchers are turning to
relatives of black-footed ferrets to develop a vaccine against
canine distemper, which led to the removal of the last known North
American ferrets from the wild.
   ``The problem that we have is that on canine distemper for dogs
and cats, a vet will give those animals a live vaccine,'' said Art
Reese, Wyoming Game and Fish Department chief of habitat and
technical services. ``You can't do that with a ferret. We tried that
with the first ones and it killed them.''
   Biologists using Siberian, Fitch and domestic ferrets have
succeeded only in developing a three-month inoculation, Reese said.
``In a lab setting that would be all right, but in the wild it isn't
worth a darn.''
   Since the ferrets were taken from their colony in 1985,
researchers have bred 58 in captivity. Six kits went in October to
the National Zoo and eight go to the Henry Doorley Zoo in Omaha,
Neb., this month for breeding.
   Using five breeding facilities around the country to bolster the
genetic makeup of breeding populations, Reese said, experts hope by
fiscal 1991 to have 50 ferrets, enough to return some to the high
plains desert around Meeteetse. The next year they hope to begin
reintroduction in other states, including Montana, Colorado, Idaho,
Utah and Nebraska.
   The department is building prairie dog towns that will be used to
train the laboratory-bred ferrets, Reese said. ``The ferrets will
essentially be trained in prairie dog towns to hunt prairie dogs and
interact similarly to an environment in which they're going to be
placed.''

<HEAD>Scientists Concerned Over Vole Population in Tundra</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEDERLAND, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest population of voles in 30
years is playing havoc with the fragile Rocky Mountain tundra as the
thumb-sized rodents chew their way through grass and leave areas
open to erosion.
   They have altered the high-country growth as profoundly as fire
changed Yellowstone, scientists say. ``It's just far greater than
anything we have ever guessed at,'' said University of Colorado
researcher Norm French.
   There may be 25 times more voles this year than at the low point
of their 30-year population cycle, said researcher Jim Halfpenny.
Their kin, the Arctic lemmings, are famous for extreme population
fluctuations.
   ``It could make major changes not only in vegetation but changes
in animal communities up there. And when you consider this is Front
Range-wide, it could be a major event in a significant part of the
Rocky Mountains,'' French said.
   Outbreaks have been found in Montana and Wyoming, and Denver-area
residents have reported vole-chewed lawns. The vole explosion could
have a serious impact on the food supply of the pica, another small
tundra rodent, he said.
   But Halfpenny doesn't see the chewed terrain as damaged. ``The
tundra you see now is already a product of voles,'' he said. ``We've
been looking at the picture for ages, and this year, we're learning
how the picture was made.''
   The National Science Foundation has funded a study of the voles.

   The government's only official earthquake
prediction _ of a moderate central California jolt by 1993 _ is
being challenged by research indicating it could be much stronger,
or could even trigger the ``big one.''
   The U.S. Geological Survey in 1985 predicted a quake measuring 6
on the Richter scale for the Parkfield area, which has been shaken
so regularly it has become a prime site for experiments in
earthquake forecasting.
   ``There is a good possibility that it's going to be larger than
predicted,'' said Ralph Archuleta, a University of California, Santa
Barbara, seismologist who concluded that a quake on the San Andreas
Fault near Parkfield could measure 7.2 on the Richter scale.
   UCLA geophysicist David D. Jackson says the quake might to be
smaller than the U.S.G.S.-predicted moderate temblor, but could
trigger a magnitude 8 great quake along a longer stretch of the
fault _ the long-feared ``big one.''
   Despite their studies of pent-up stress along the fault,
published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, U.S.G.S.
stands by its prediction _ the first and only long-term quake
prediction endorsed by the national and California earthquake
prediction evaluation councils.
   ``From the beginning, all official statements have said there is
a possibility of a larger event, but we think that possibility is
small,'' maybe 2 percent, said seismologist Allan Lindh, chief
scientist at the Geological Survey's Parkfield experiment.
   Geologist Kerry Sieh, a quake prediction pioneer at the
California Institute of Technology, agrees with Archuleta that the
quake could be a major jolt rather than a moderate or great quake.
But there is an outside chance even a moderate quake could grow, or
trigger a great quake within hours, he said.
   The predicted magnitude 6 quake near Parkfield, 180 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, is expected to cause little damage in the
town of about 34 residents, and the surrounding, sparsely populated
Cholame Valley, which has experienced such jolts roughly every 22
years, most recently in 1966.
   The regularity of the quakes spurred the U.S.G.S. prediction,
based on the theory that a ``characteristic earthquake'' occurs
every time enough stress has built up on the 20-mile-long Parkfield
segment of the San Andreas. Temblors of about magnitude 6 have
rocked the segment almost every 22 years: Jan. 9, 1857; Feb. 2,
1881; March 3, 1901; March 10, 1922; June 8, 1934; and June 28, 1966.
   Lindh and Archuleta said a major quake probably would cause
unreinforced brick buildings to collapse 30 miles away in Paso
Robles, and nonstructural damage as far away as Bakersfield, San
Luis Obispo and perhaps Monterey.
   A great quake like the one Jackson believes is possible would
rupture the fault well into Southern California, and could kill
14,000 people, hospitalize 55,000 and cause $17 billion damage,
according to a 1980 federal report.
   Archuleta's study concluded that in addition to the stress built
up on the Parkfield segment of the fault, much strain also has
accumulated on the next 20-mile segment to the southeast, which
could rupture with a magnitude 7.2.
   Jackson's study suggests the stress might be enough to make the
fault break in a great quake along 220 miles of its length.
   ``There is historical precedent for Parkfield earthquakes
triggering great earthquakes. It happened once before,'' Sieh said.
That was a magnitude 8 jolt in 1857 that killed two people in
Southern California, then occupied by only about 4,000.
   Sieh, Archuleta and Lindh all doubt enough stress has built up
southeast of Bitterwater Valley for the next Parkfield quake to be a
great quake or trigger one. Jackson argued that the stress, while
less than that relieved in 1857, is enough to cause a great quake
and has caused huge shocks on other faults.
   He also acknowledges it might not even rupture the entire
Parkfield segment. And because the 1934 quake came 10 years earlier
than would have been expected, he says it may be 10 to 15 years
before the next one, and not 1993.

   The economy continued to surge in November, with

   With 463,000 new payroll jobs, the government

   The job growth was twice what economists had anticipated and
nearly double the 238,000 increase in new jobs in October, the Labor
Department said Friday.
   But a 560,000 person increase in the civilian labor force _ those

14-year low of 5.3 percent in October to 5.4 percent last month, it
said.

   A U.S. crusade to eliminate all subsidies that
distort farm trade ran into heavy opposition on the eve of
free-trade talks among more than 100 nations.
   The conflict over farm trade threatened Sunday to block progress

   Trade ministers are meeting here to give a political push to
negotiations at the midpoint of the four-year Uruguay Round of

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experiment by well-heeled Moslem
fundamentalists to make money by capitalizing on religious
Egyptians' devotion to Islam has gone sour.
   For years, more than 100 Islamic investment companies seemed to
work perfectly, and by late 1987 hundreds of thousands of mainly
small-time investors were participating in the companies'
profit-sharing schemes.
   The companies drew up to $3.5 billion from depositors, many
earning three times what they would have from banks _ and without
interest, banned as usury by Islam's holy book, the Koran.
   But all was not well behind the scenes. Rumors circulated of
illegal dealing by many of the big companies, including black
marketeering, capital flight, money laundering and skimming off new
depositors' funds to pay obligations to old investors.
   Finally, last August, the government stepped in, enacting a law
that in November effectively brought the companies under the control
of the Central Bank and the Economy Ministry.
   The result: deep legal trouble for most of the companies and a
long and tormenting wait for investors, many of whom face the
possibility that much of their savings are lost.
   The wait ended for some in November, when 13 of the 104
investment companies provided required documentation and said they
want to stay in business under the new guidelines. Another 23
declared they would liquidate and return investors' funds.
   But officials revealed that 68 companies and individuals
connected with them were liable for prosecution.
   The biggest company, al-Rayyan, worth more than $1 billion, came
under heavy fire. Attorney General Gamal Shouman ordered detention
of 49 of its officers, their family members and the company's
accountants and froze their assets on grounds their illegal
operations jeopardized depositors' funds.
   Under supervision of the Ministry of Justice, security officers
sealed the company's many warehouses, jewelry stores, restaurants
and other establishments.
   There is no official estimate of Islamic company holdings, but
newspapers have reported totals of 6 billion to 8 billion Egyptian
pounds ($2.6 billion to $3.5 billion). Additionally, unknown amounts
are said to be stashed in banks abroad.
   The wait has been unpleasant for depositors and the state.
   ``I've been coming here to get my return for three months now,''
Saddiqa Ahmed, who had deposited about $870 with al-Rayyan Co., said
as she stood one October day with other disgruntled depositers
outside company headquarters.
   ``Every time they tell me to come back next week. Now they say
they have no money to give us. What am I to do?''
   She was among about 175,000 people who deposited money, sometimes
life's savings, with al-Rayyan, which operated about four years
before its closure.
   Ten female depositors marched on President Hosni Mubarak's house
to vent their fury, bringing in hundreds of security troops in gas
masks, shields and helmets to protect Mubarak from other possible
outbursts.
   The Islamic investment movement was begun more than 10 years ago
by el-Sherif Co., a plastic manufacturer that is among the handful
of companies in full compliance with the new law. It drew deposits
from Egyptian workers in oil-rich Arab states by promising high
returns through a system prescribed by the 1,400-year-old Islamic
legal and social system, Sharia.
   Sharia bans interest payments on loans or deposits but allows
profit-sharing, with its attendant risks.
   As Islamic fervor increased across the country, many more
companies sprang up. Company owners, pictured in newspaper
advertisements wearing white robes and skull-caps and long, bushy
beards typical of Moslem fundamentalists, appealed to investors'
piety as well as investment sense.
   Targeting Egyptian expatriates during the early 1980s Arab oil
boom, the companies soon were collecting more remittances in hard
currency than banks, which had to convert the money at official
exchange rates much below those available on the black market.
   Since the mid-1980s, the companies regularly have returned up to
three times the 10 percent average interest rate offered by banks.
   Company names, many with Islamic connotation, sprouted along
highways on billboards and in cities on jewelry stores,
sophisticated butcher shops and alcohol-free restaurants. One
investment company even ran a summer camp and hotel on Egypt's
western Mediterranean coast.
   The government began to suspect dubious activity last year, soon
after reports began appearing of enormous losses by a couple of the
larger companies from speculating in gold and silver on European
markets.
   Many Egyptians felt the government acted to curtail a potentially
dangerous increase in the companies' power and because of
indications that some may have been funding religious extremist
groups that demand immediate and total implementation of Sharia. The
government claims 90 percent of Egypt's legal code already conforms
to Islamic law.
   The government said it acted simply to protect depositors and has
vowed to try its best to refund them.
   Hardly any fundamentalist propaganda was evident in this fall's
important university election campaigns. Campus and police sources
attributed the decrease to the crackdown, either because of a drop
in direct funding of favored candidates by Islamic companies or a
decline in parents' profit-sharing income.
   By last summer, many companies were postponing payments, which
worried customers and prompted firmer government measures such as
banning company owners from travel.
   A week before the November deadline for compliance with the new
law, Prime Minister Atef Sidki used a rarely invoked power to issue
a military order freezing al-Rayyan's monetary transactions
retroactive to April 1988. But the action created even more
confusion for investors.
   ``What is the government doing to us?'' protested one depositor
after the al-Rayyan freeze was announced. ``We knew these company
owners were thieves, but we were receiving our monthly dividends.
   ``The state is killing us swiftly with its own hands, instead of
leaving us to die slowly,'' he said. ``We'll never see our money.''
   To further complicate the situation, stories of scandal surfaced
involving al-Rayyan and the three brothers who ran it.
   One, Mohammed Tawfiq Abdel-Fattah al-Rayyan, was arrested and
jailed for importing foodstuffs illegally.
   At about the same time, Mohammed's older brother Fat'hy was
hospitalized for a nervous condition, then became addicted to his
medication. He died in early November, officially of a heart attack
but according to newspaper reports more likely of a drug overdose.
   As the youngest brother, Ahmed, became chairman of the board, the
government assigned security officers to keep tabs on al-Rayyan
family members.

<HEAD>Family Popcorn Farm Searches For Perfect Poppers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A half-century search for perfect
poppers taught Jim Beebe's family a few gourmet secrets.
   At the Beebe farm, a ring of trees shields bins of popcorn from
scorching sun and chilling wind. A bed of air floats the best
kernels away from the chaff, and a popping tube confirms that
virtually every kernel will explode into one of the nation's
favorite snacks.
   ``Quality control is our No. 1 job around here,'' said Beebe, who
sends slightly imperfect popcorn to feed a cousin's hogs. ``We take
care of our popcorn and don't abuse it.''
   Beebe's parents started the business in 1936. After they died,
his sister and brother-in-law joined him in 1985 to create
Beebe-Stevenson, which now grows about 700,000 bushels of popcorn a
year.
   The popcorn is sold in containers ranging from 3.5-ounce
microwave packages to 50-pound bags. It is marketed in independent
grocery stores, at school ballgames, church events, and as a
promotional gift used by businesses.
   Beebe, 50, gave up a Danville teaching position and returned in
August to manage the business.
   He plans to concentrate distribution on an area within 50 miles
of this small east-central Illinois community.
   New products, new packaging and new customers are part of Beebe's
plan to boost sales in a higly competitive business.
   Illinois farmers harvested about 36,000 acres of popcorn last
year, said to Deirdre Flynn of the Popcorn Institute. The state is
generally second or third to the nation's popcorn leader, Indiana.
   The United States supplies 90 percent of the world's popcorn, and
consumes 11.9 billion quarts of popcorn a year. The industry has
been growing from 4 percent to 6 percent a year.
   ``It's a good-for-you snack,'' Flynn said. ``There is a lot of
emphasis now on healthy eating and popcorn is high in fiber and
carbohydrate and low in calories if you don't just smother it in
butter.''
   Beebe-Stevenson has had 200 to 300 acres of popcorn in its crop
rotation in recent years, some grown on contract by other farmers in
Illinois and Indiana. Once a delicate plant, hybrid seed now has
made popcorn strong and efficient.
   ``We harvest it on the cob so we keep it in God's wrapper,''
Beebe said.
   It is dried without artificial heat to prevent damage, then hand
shelled the following spring. The corn floats over a table on air,
with the perfect kernels moving to one side and on to packages.
   Beebe said many long-time customers still prefer to buy popcorn
in bulk, at a cost of 30 cents a pound for 50-pound bags.
   But the microwave market is the place for growth. The price is at
least 10 times higher per pound, mainly because of hand labor _ a
worker scoops kernels into a microwave bag, adds a pinch of salt and
a squirt of soybean oil and butter flavor.
   Cousin Garrett Beebe, who manages farming operations, said
popcorn is raised the same way as commercial field corn except for
the careful handling during and after harvest to make sure the
kernels will pop.

   OPEC's daily production hit almost 23
million barrels in November, when cartel members were debating how
to cut output, the weekly Middle East Economic Survey reported
Monday.
   The agreement in Vienna in late November sets production for the
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at 18.5
million barrels per day starting January 1.
   The economic newsletter said the November daily production hit a
new peak of 22.98 million barrels and that projected December output
figures are pegged even higher. Actual production could drop as
members cut back, the weekly said.
   The new agreement sets a quota parity for Iran and Iraq at 2.64
million barrels per day. Iraq rejected its quota under the previous
1986 agreement, saying it needed to finance its war against Iran.
   Other members started ignoring their quotas, leading to an oil
glut that saw prices drop below $13 a barrel. OPEC is looking for a
benchmark price of $18 per barrel.

   The most popular products this year for the
increasingly affluent Japanese have been resort condominiums, bidets
and high-tech appliances, says a study by Japan's leading ad firm.
   ``Demand for safe and prosperous living is becoming stronger.
Enjoyable meals, health and peace of mind are all required elements
for creating a rich life,'' according to ``Hit Products and Consumer
Trends for 1988,'' an annual study on market trends released
recently by Dentsu Inc.
   Long accustomed to living in sparsely furnished, unheated rooms,
the Japanese are rearranging their homes and ``starting to live
according to individual tastes,'' the study says.
   The most remarkable trend is a proliferation of new homes and
expensive household products. Rental dwellers have given up on
buying homes in urban centers and are instead investing in resort
condominiums outside the city, where they can spend their weekends
in spacious comfort, the report says.
   Over 10,000 resort condos have been supplied to
``leisure-oriented'' Japanese in 1988, it says.
   Imported furniture to fill those homes is another hit. The
Japanese spent about $829.7 million on high quality European
furniture in the first nine months of the year, according to the
report.
   Cordless irons, multi-functional telephones and fully automatic
washing machines are popular time-savers, Dentsu says. It estimates
that 40 percent of the 4.3 million washing machines sold this year
will be automatic rinse and spin washers.
   Phones with answering-phone and other devices will account for
about half of the 6.9 million telephones sold this year, due in part
to a 30 percent price reduction in the past two years, the report
says.
   Japanese are turning to these time and labor-saving products, as
well as housecleaning services, to enhance their leisure time. By
1995, housecleaning services will become a $2.48 billion market, the
report says.
   Toilets with warm-water bidets and heated seats are another hit
this year, Dentsu says.
   Japanese are also pampering themselves with imported tableware,
fresh foods and chocolates to fulfill desires for
``self-realization,'' the report said.
   ``They seek satisfaction in mind and spirit through the pursuit
of luxury in life. The strong yen also allows them to step into what
had been a `dream world' in the past,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Say Economy Continued Robust in November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy continued to grow in
November, but at a slightly slower pace than the previous month, a
study of corporate purchasing executives found.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the strength of the economy with a monthly survey of purchasing
executives, said Sunday that its Purchasing Managers Index dipped to
56.6 percent from October's 56.8 percent.
   But the index still indicated the economy continued to be robust.
A reading above 50 indicates the economy is generally expanding,
while a reading of less than 50 indicates the economy is contracting.
   The purchasing managers who took part in the survey said
production continued to increase last month, but at a slightly
slower clip than in October.
   Twenty-seven percent of the respondents reported production was
up, compared with 26 percent in October. Fifty-eight percent,
compared with October's 65 percent, said production was the same,
but 15 percent said production was slower, compared with 9 percent
the previous month.
   Employment was sharply higher in November. Eighteen percent of
the respondents reported higher employment, while 69 percent said it
was the same and 13 percent said it was down. That compared with 16
percent reporting higher employment during October, 72 percent
reporting it was the same and 12 percent reporting it fell.
   The purchasing managers also reported new orders grew in November.
   Thirty percent of the respondents said their companies had more
new orders last month, while 52 percent reported orders were the
same and 18 percent said orders were down. That compared with 28
percent reporting orders up in October, 54 percent saying they were
the same and 18 percent saying they were down.
   Vendor deliveries, which indicate whether companies are getting
orders faster than they can fill them, were again slow in November
but picked up some speed from October. Eleven percent of the
purchasing managers said deliveries were slower in November,
compared with 17 percent the previous month.
   Eighty-one percent said deliveries were running at the same rate,
compared with 77 percent in October. Eight percent said they were
faster, compared with October's 6 percent.
   Inventories increased last month. Seventeen percent of the
purchasing managers said their inventories were higher, 61 percent
said they were the same and 22 percent said they were lower. In
October, 15 percent reported they were higher, 65 percent said they
were the same and 20 percent said they were lower.
   Prices continued to rise, with 40 percent of the respondents
saying they were paying more for goods, 58 percent saying they were
the same and 2 percent saying they were lower. In October, 45
percent said they were higher, 51 percent said prices were the same
and 4 percent said they were lower.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which
represents puchasing executives nationwide, said it questioned
managers in more than 250 industrial companies for its survey.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Gets Tenders for 98 Percent of Kraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said today nearly all of
Kraft Inc.'s common stock had been tendered under its $12.9 billion
buyout offer, clearing the way for creation of the world's biggest
consumer products company.
   The tobacco and consumer products giant said it planned to
complete the acquisition of Kraft as soon as possible, but offered
no specific date.
   Philip Morris said more than 117 million Kraft shares, or around
98 percent of the company's outstanding stock, had been tendered
under the offer that expired on Friday. It said those shares had
been accepted for payment at $96.25 in cash each.
   The acquisition is one of a series of huge deals in the food
business, capped by RJR Nabisco Inc.'s agreement last week to be
acquired by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for
nearly $25 billion.
   Philip Morris, which already has such brands as Miller beer,
Marlboro cigarettes, Jell-O desserts and Maxwell House coffee, will
be adding Kraft lines such as Cracker Barrel cheese, Miracle Whip
salad dressing and Budget Gourmet frozen foods.
   The merger will unite two companies that had combined sales of
$37.6 billion in 1987, surpassing the nearly $31 billion in sales
reported by the Anglo-Dutch concern Unilever NV, which has been the
biggest consumer products company.
   Kraft stock was trading at under $60 a share when Philip Morris
proposed a buyout at $90 a share in mid-October.
   Kraft rejected the offer as inadequate and proposed a
recapitalization plan that it valued at $110 a share, including a
cash dividend of $84 a share.
   But by the end of the month, the two companies signed an
agreement under which Philip Morris agreed to pay $106 a share for
all of Kraft's stock.

   Prices opened higher on Wall Street today, led by
buying in blue chip issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 7.12 to
2,099.40 as of 10 a.m. EST.
   Advancing issues led decliners by a margin of about 13-to-9, with
517 stocks rising, 358 falling and 514 unchanged in early New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled a light 18.29 million shares
after the first 30 minutes of trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 0.30 to
153.32. The American Stock Exchange's market value index moved up
0.26 to 295.53.
   Buying in blue chip issues carried the market higher, said Jack
Baker, head of block trading with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``The market looks like it wants to do better,'' Baker said,
although he said Wall Street still expected the Federal Reserve
Board to raise its discount rate to counter inflationary pressures.
   Concerns about rising interest rates have weighed on the market
recently.
   There was no specific news to affect trading today, but the
market had ``a little better tone,'' Baker said.
   Early gainers included IBM, up | to 119~, Texaco, up | to 47|,
and UAL, up 1 to 108}.
   Among decliners, Occidental Petroleum was off [ at 25~, and
Upjohn slipped | to 27~.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.60 to
2,092.28, but still emerged from the week with a 17.60-point gain.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4-to-3 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 822 issues falling,
616 rising and 504 unchanged.
   Volume totaled a sluggish 124.61 million shares, down from 129.38
million the previous session.

<HEAD>Mulroney Urges Compromise on International Trade Dispute</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with meeting opening, other
details. Picks up 10th graf pvs, Duffy warned ... A version moving
on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today opened the
most ambitious trade negotiations ever undertaken, urging officials
of 90 nations to compromise to resolve trade differences.
   In an apparent reference to a clash between the United States and
its allies on farm subsidies, Mulroney exhorted the delegates to
``be motivated by a spirit of honorable compromise.''
   Mulroney said farmers around the world ``are looking for results
in Montreal. They can no longer survive on a diet of promises.''
   The round of trade negotiations is designed to liberalize and
broaden the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international
trade-policing treaty signed in 1947. GATT now has 96 members, and
90 trade ministers were at today's meeting.
   The U.S. delegation has come under strong criticism from Japan,
Australia and the European Community over its demand to completely
eliminate government supports for farmers. The 12-nation European
Community is only willing to reduce them, terming the U.S. position
unrealistic.
   Mulroney urged the negotiators to ``be animated by a spirit of
realism,'' echoing similar weekend calls to the United States in
preparatory consultations for the mid-term review of the four-year
Uruguay Round of trade talks.
   The United States was further isolated by a tentative accord
reached between the Europeans and developing nations that would
remove or reduce tariffs on the export of tropical products to the
industrialized world.
   An EC spokeswoman said the United States did not yet support the
agreement, which would affect $70 billion in internaional trade of
such products as jute, bananas and coffee.
   Michael Duffy, Australia's Minister of Trade Negotiations, told
reporters Sunday that blame for U.S.-European impasse over trade
barriers should be shared by the two parties.
   But he and other officials looked to the Americans to make the
first move.
   Duffy warned that if neither side compromises during the
three-day talks, ``it will sour the rest of the round,'' which ends
in 1990.
   The dispute over agricultural subsidies has clouded prospects for
progress on other urgent trade problems, such as the inclusion of
the booming services trade in the 40-year-old GATT pact and the
adoption of safeguards for copyrights and patents.
   ``It's hard to see how there can be progress in other areas
without progress in agriculture,'' said John Crosbie, Canada's
Minister for International Trade.
   The United States took a conciliatory stand but insisted it would
stick to its main objective.
   Chief agriculture negotiator Dan Amstutz noted the United States
had moved away from setting a 2000 deadline for elimination of
subsidies and agreed to emergency government food stockpiles as long
as they are bought on the open market.
   ``We're flexible,'' he said, but ``we'd rather not have any
agreement than a bad one.''
   The U.S. delegation also appeared to hold out the possibility it
would relent on its rejection of a proposal lifting barriers on the
export of tropical products, such as bananas and coconuts, by
developing nations.
   U.S. trade negotiator Alan Holmer warned that failure by the GATT
round could create ``uncertainties'' in Congress and within the
incoming administration of George Bush. He did not elaborate.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the
Senate Agriculture Committee, said failure on the farm support issue
would result in an ``export-oriented'' farm bill.
   Congress is scheduled to draft a farm bill next year and Leahy
indicated it would include supports for farmers so they can compete
effectively against farmers whose governments also subsidize exports.
   The United States projects that its 1989 farm supports will
amount to $13 billion _ down from the $27 million of 1987 but still
a heavy burden on the deficit-ridden budget.
   U.S. officials say Europeans could save about $200 billion every
year if they stopped their farm supports. But the EC, under the
influence of powerful farm lobbies, says eliminating supports is not
a viable option.

<HEAD>Grand Met Extends Pillsbury Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BARBARA DEWEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC on Monday extended for
the sixth time its $60-a-share takeover bid for Pillsbury Co., and
said about 88 percent of Pillsbury's outstanding shares have been
tendered.
   The British conglomerate said its $5.23 billion offer now will
expire at midnight Friday EST, unless extended.
   Grand Met's previous offer expired at midnight last Friday, at
which time 75,446,595 shares of Pillsbury common stock had been
tendered, the company said. When Grand Met made a previous extension
on Nov. 28, it said that 85 percent of the food and restaurant
company's common stock had been tendered as Nov. 25.
   Pillsbury spokesman Johnny Thompson said Monday he had no comment
on the latest Grand Met extension. ``It's just another one,'' he
said.
   Last week, Pillsbury Chairman Philip L. Smith sent a letter to
Grand Met Chairman Allen Sheppard saying the offer was ``financially
inadequate'' and, therefore, a meeting between the two would serve
no purpose.
   Grand Met, a liquor, gambling and specialty products
conglomerate, launched its unsolicited bid for the Minneapolis-based
Pillsbury on Oct. 4.
   Pillsbury's board of directors has rejected the offer as
inadequate and urged shareholders not to tender their stock.
   Pillsbury had planned to spin off its Burger King subsidiary, but
delayed the move at the request of a Delaware court that is hearing
Grand Met's challenge of the plan.
   Grand Met also is challenging Pillsbury's anti-takeover ``poison
pill'' defense, which makes hostile takeovers prohibitively
expensive.

   Prices rose sharply on Wall Street today as stock
traders apparently shrugged off worries about rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 22.76 to
2,115.04 as of 11 a.m. EST.
   Advancing issues led decliners by a margin of about 2-to-1, with
758 stocks rising, 394 falling and 534 unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 43.42 million shares at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 1.18 to

0.65 to 295.94.
   ``The market looks like it wants to do better,'' said Jack Baker,
head of block trading with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Analysts said Wall Street still expected the Federal Reserve
Board to raise its discount rate to cool down the economy and
counter inflationary pressures.
   However, even with the specter of rising interest rates, the
market appeared to be buoyed by its own resilience, said Michael
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co.
   Stock prices slipped on Friday after the Labor Department's
employment report indicated the economy continued to surge, but did
not fall as much as market watchers had feared.
   ``Anyone had to be impressed _ all that bad news, but the market
didn't give much ground,'' said Metz.
   A stable bond market and improved dollar lent support to Wall
Street today, Metz said.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was British Steel,
which was unchanged at 11|.
   Big gainers included IBM, up 1{ to 120}, Ford Motor, up 1 to 52},

   Steel importers said today that the United
States' steel quota program was preferable to the expense and
uncertainty of trade lawsuits, and they proposed modifying it since
the Bush administration seemed intent on renewing it.
   ``The current Voluntary Restraint Agreements on imported steel
have, over the past four years, brought about market shortages and
price increases, reduced net manufacturing employment ... and
diminished the potential for the export of steel-intensive
products,'' the importers said.
   But modifications were endorsed by the American Institute for
Imported Steel, the Texas Association of Steel Importers and the
West Coast Metal Importers Assocation.
   The institute says any renewed quota plan should be flexible
enough to avoid the shortages steel users experienced for certain
products under the current plan. They say the more flexible program
could also lessen the sometimes sharp price hikes on some products.
   Meanwhile, steel-consuming manufacturers who complain about tight
supplies and sharp price increases go further by saying American
steel producers are looking a little too prosperous to be demanding
an extension of trade protection.
   Those steel users are raising their voices in opposition to a
renewal of the five-year Voluntary Restraint Agreements, or import
quotas, due to expire in September.
   ``Our guys would kill to be making the profit on sales that
they're making right now,'' said Greg Estell, spokesman for the
1,000 member companies of the Precision Metal Forming Association.
   The Cleveland-based association employs about 80,000 of the
estimated 350,000 American workers who bend, stamp and cut steel
into parts for cars, appliances and a variety of industrial and
consumer equipment. That niche of the steel-using industries alone
surpasses the approximately 170,000 employees of the nation's 300
steelmaking companies.
   ``We're not in the same situation here in 1988 that we were in
1984,'' Estell said about the steel industry.
   The numbers back him up.
   The 25 steel producers who represent 80 percent of the nation's
raw steel production earned around $1 billion in 1987, the first
full year of recovery after a gruesome recession. They more than
doubled that figure, to nearly $2.5 billion, in the first nine
months of this year, according to the American Iron and Steel
Institute.
   ``The steel industry has returned to substantial profitability
and can look forward to another good year in 1989,'' said Inland
Steel Industries Inc. Chairman Frank W. Luerssen.
   That is what's bothering steel users like Caterpillar Inc., Deere
& Co., who see steelmakers raising prices in line with tighter
supplies while at the same time lobbying President-elect George Bush
to extend the import quotas for another five years.
   Steel users say the quota program should be scrapped and a fair
steel trade system negotiated either country-by-country or worldwide
through the mechanisms of the General Agreements on Tariffs and
Trade.
   Steelmakers say GATT does not work, and that the VRAs have proved
themselves as the best solution to the predatory pricing that
foreign producers employ because of excess world capacity.
   Caterpillar trade specialist William Lane suggested the
steelmakers want to have their cake and eat it too.
   ``They're saying they need protection because of surplus world
capacity, but the reason prices are increasing is tight world
supply,'' he said.
   Estell said the metal forming association has tracked price
increases of up to 40 percent for hot-rolled steel and 12 to 13
percent for cold-rolled.
   The users say the VRAs are at least partially to blame for higher
prices because the import quotas reduce the supply in relation to
demand.
   Steel producers say the VRAs have nothing to do with prices.
   The users also complain that delivery times were stretched and
some mills were allocating shipments early this year because of
tight supplies.
   In contrast to the tarnished reputation of American steelmakers
when recession hit with vengeance after 1981, ``the U.S. steel
industry is considered the low-cost producer in the world,'' Lane
said. ``We would certainly agree with that. They've done a
remarkable job of reducing costs and improving quality.''
   ``They say they are world-class competitors, and we tend to
agree, and if that's so then they should act like world
competitors,'' said Estell.
   For the nation's steel forgers, higher prices are less
troublesome than short supplies. They want their prime raw material,
special quality bars and billets removed from the VRA program
because ``forgers can't get what they need domestically ... and VRAs
prevent them from getting it from offshore,'' the Forging Industry
Association said.
   ``It is unfair for the U.S. government to support one segment of
the U.S. economy to the detriment of other segments,'' the
Cleveland-based group said.
   The American steelmakers say they deserve another round of quota
protection because they have not fully recovered from losing $12
billion during a 5-year recession.
   ``It will take much more than a few quarters of profitability to
offset the financial damage of the 1982-86 recession years,''
Washington-based AISI said.
   The U.S. producers also claim their prices in general have not
risen drastically.
   Average steel prices rose about 3 percent from 1980 to 1987,
while average prices of construction equipment rose 6 percent and
the price of agricultural machinery rose about 20 percent, AISI said.
   By the second quarter of this year, prices were around 7 percent
higher than they were in the fourth quarter of last year and roughly
2 percent higher than when the VRAs were instituted in late 1984.
   The AISI calls that ``hardly a spectacular increase, given the
rate of inflation in the 1981-87 period and the tight supply-demand
situation worldwide that existed in the first half of this year.''

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade following a selloff in
the soybean market.
   Analysts said Iowa Grain Co., a large speculative brokerage firm,
sold a large amount of soybean contracts in the first 15 minutes of
the session. The soybean market had opened higher on reports that
little rain fell over the weekend in the major soybean-growing
regions of South America.
   Grain prices also turned mixed early in the session despite a
strong lineup of countries, including South Korea, Morocco and the
Philippines, seeking to buy U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   ``There are a lot of export bonus wheat tenders in the offing but
in terms of the real giant business _ from China or the Soviet Union
_ it just hasn't materialized,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading wheat was 1 cent lower to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.18 a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to { cent higher with December at $2.58{ a bushel; oats were 1
cent lower to 1} cents higher with December at $1.96 a bushel;
soybeans were 1} cents lower to 1{ cents higher with January at
$7.67 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lower with December at
71.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .32 cent lower
with January at 82.30 cents a pound; hogs were .07 cent lower to .15
cent higher with December at 40.30 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .22 cent to .40 cent lower with February at 45.10 cents
a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Friday while pork futures were

   Prices surged higher on Wall Street today as
investors, reassured by the market's resilience in recent trading,
apparently shrugged off worries about rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks soared 33.61 to
2,125.89 as of noon EST.
   Advancing issues led decliners by a margin of better than 2-to-1,
with 866 stocks rising, 409 falling and 520 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled a brisk 73.39 million shares at
midday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 1.52 to
154.54. The American Stock Exchange's market value index moved up
1.32 to 296.59.
   Analysts said the market was buoyed today by its own ability to
rebound after negative news.
   ``We held together fairly well Friday despite the non-farm
payroll leap,'' said Alfred Goldman, a market analyst with A.G.
Edwards Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Stock prices slipped Friday after the Labor Department reported
463,000 new jobs _ known as the non-farm payroll _ were created last
month.
   The figures indicated the economy continued to thrive, but
although the report heightened fears that the Federal Reserve would
move interest rates higher, stock prices did not fall as much as
market watchers had feared.
   ``It seems people are being encouraged by the market's
invulnerability to bad news, said Michael Metz, an analyst with
Oppenheimer & Co.
   ``It's rather a litle surprising and impressive,'' Goldman said.
   Goldman said investors who were expecting a year-end rally on
Wall Street might be doing some early shopping. However, he warned,
``Interest rates remain very high ... I think they will dampen any
rally attempt.''
   A stable bond market and improved dollar lent support to Wall
Street today, Metz said.
   In addition, Goldman said, strength in transportation issues was
spilling over to other stocks. UAL was up 1} to 109{, and AMR rose
1| to 53{.

<HEAD>Drexel Outlines Possible Indictment and Plea Agreement to Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment giant
under investigation for more than two years, has told employees that
negotiations with federal prosecutors have reached a ``crucial
stage'' and the firm may either face racketeering indictments or
plead guilty to lesser charges soon.
   Chief executive Frederick Joseph outlined the status of Drexel's
crisis in a memorandum to the staff last week. Copies were leaked to
the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, and sources familiar
with the letter confirmed the contents of the memo today.
   A guilty plea would mark a stunning turnaround for Drexel, which
vowed to fight accusations of securities fraud that arose after
speculator Ivan F. Boesky implicated the firm in a plea bargain he
reached with the government.
   Boesky, who had extensive dealings with Drexel, paid a record
$100 million in fines and penalties for insider trading and is now
serving a three-year prison term for conspiracy to lie to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Drexel was named in a SEC civil securities fraud complaint nearly
three months ago, and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani has been
supervising a grand jury investigation of the firm.
   ``In recent weeks, we have had discussions with the government
which are now reaching a crucial stage,'' Joseph told employees in
the memo.
   If Drexel does not agree to settlement terms with Giuliani, the
memo read, ``we believe that he intends to indict the firm (as well
as certain of our employees,) and to include in such an indictment
so-called racketeering charges.''
   Conviction under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law, which originally was intended to combat drug
pushers and pimps, would taint Drexel as a criminal enterprise and
could entail crippling fines.
   ``If we settle, we can put this constant attack on the firm
behind us,'' Joseph said in the memo. ``But to do so will require a
guilty plea. We believe, however, that the U.S. attorney would not
accept a settlement from Drexel unless it exceeds Boesky's
settlement.''
   He estimated that as a result of the investigation, the firm
already had lost $1.5 billion in potential revenues, spent $175
million in direct legal expenses and provided 1.5 million pages of
government-requested documents.
   Joseph said any settlement likely would involve what he called a
``substantial dollar amount and a guilty plea by the firm, as well
as other conditions.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment. Officials at
Giuliani's office also declined to comment, in accordance with their
practice of confidentiality about criminal investigations.
   The Journal, quoting sources it did not identify, said Drexel was
leaning more toward a settlement because of several recent
developments, notably subpoenas to Drexel attorneys from Giuliani's
office and his attempts to compel cooperation from a senior employee
to substantiate the government's case.
   The Journal quoted sources as saying Drexel officials also feared
they would lose business if the company was branded a racketeer.

<HEAD>Heinz Reports Increased Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H.J. Heinz Co. said Monday its profit rose 14.5
percent in the second quarter due in part to hefty sales for its
Weight Watchers food products.
   For the three-month period ended Oct. 26, Heinz' after-tax profit
totaled $109.9 million, or 83 cents a share, up from $96.05 million,
or 72 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
   The company's revenue rose 11.4 percent in the period to $1.42
billion from $1.28 billion in the second quarter of 1987.
   Heinz attributed its second-quarter growth to healthy sales of
its Weight Watchers food products and strong attendance at Weight
Watchers meetings. The company also said it was helped by strong
volume increases in sales of its tuna, foodservice ketchup and
frozen potatoes.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, H.J. Heinz reported
a profit of $220 million, or $1.67 per share, on sales of $2.8
billion. That compares with a first-half 1987 profit of $193.2
million, or $1.45 a share, on sales of $2.52 billion.

<HEAD>Judge Who Broke Up AT&T Convinced He Made Right Decision</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Bell System Breakup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene says he's
become even more convinced over the last year that his decision to
break up the Bell System has been good for residential and business
customers alike.
   Long-distance rates have dropped, the quality of the telephone
network has remained high and new telecommunications products and
services are being offered to consumers faster than ever before, he
said.
   ``The key to all of this is competition,'' he said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``Divestiture introduced
competition, real competition, for the first time in the
telecommunications industry and ... it's bound to have a good
effect.''
   Greene took over the U.S. vs. AT&T antitrust case in August 1978
after the death of the original trial judge, Joseph C. Waddy, and
continues to monitor the consent decree that settled the case to see
that the public interest is served.
   Greene came to the case with a reputation as an activist, liberal
jurist. He fled Nazi Germany with his family in 1939 at age 16, saw
combat in the Army during World War II, and later prosecuted civil
rights cases for the Justice Department.
   Working with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Greene drafted
the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965.
   Greene's objective in U.S. vs. AT&T was to prove the competence
of the federal courts to manage effectively a major antitrust case.
   In the interview, Greene acknowledged the consumer confusion that
resulted from the lawsuit that separated American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. from its local operating companies. He also noted that
``it did take AT&T and the local companies awhile to get their act
together'' after the decree went into effect Jan. 1, 1984.
   But, he said, ``favorable developments outweigh by far the
problems that have arisen.''
   When AT&T was the nation's major provider of local and
long-distance service, manufacturer of phone equipment and
telecommunications researcher, there was no pressure on it to rush
new products and services to the market, he said.
   ``What they did do is to change the black rotary dial phones to
the yellow, beige push-button phones, which is nice, but in the last
five years the kinds of innovative things that have occurred in
household and business phones ... is the most astounding
development,'' he said.
   Many phones are now equipped with memory dialing to allow
callers, with the push of a button, to redial the last number called
or dial a frequently called number. A new service beginning to
appear in homes lets callers know before they answer who is calling
them, he said.
   ``AT&T could have done all that. Bell Laboratories ... and their
Western Electric factories were just as good then as they are now,
but they didn't bring them out because nobody forced them. There was
no competition,'' he said.
   In exchange for giving up its local operating companies, AT&T was
free to enter unregulated businesses that previously were off
limits, including the computer field. Its long-distance business,
however, remained subject to federal regulation and still does
because it is considered a ``dominant'' provider able to affect
competition in the market.
   The seven regional Bell companies, which inherited AT&T's local
phone monopolies and became known as the Baby Bells, were
constrained in the antitrust decree because of their control of the
``local loops.'' Their local phone operations have remained
regulated, but they have been free to enter certain unregulated
lines of business.
   Greene, however, has been unmoved by their pleas for more
freedom. The regional companies persuaded the Justice Department two
years ago to recommend that the judge allow the Bell companies to
provide limited long-distance and electronic information services
and manufacture telecommunications equipment.
   Greene rejected most of the recommendations but allowed the
companies to transmit, though not originate, information services.
And until he finds evidence that the Bell companies' local
monopolies have substantially eroded, he said he sees no reason to
lift the restrictions.
   ``AT&T was able to disadvantage and discriminate against smaller
competitors because they were in control of the local loops ... and
now the regional companies have those local loops,'' he said.
   ``As long as that exists, they have the same abilities to engage
in anti-competitive activities as AT&T did, and they certainly have
the same incentive _ to make money _ that AT&T did,'' he said.
   The Baby Bells have lobbied hard in Congress and in the Reagan
administration to free them from the constraints of the decree,
arguing that they have the resources to bring the information age to
the average American and Greene is standing in the way.
   Their political supporters say the judge has become a
telecommunications czar by keeping control of national
communications policy in the courts.
   Greene dismisses the criticism and says Congress has the
authority to free the Baby Bells if it wants to. He's certain,
however, what the result would be if the restrictions were lifted
from the Bell monopolies now.
   ``We would be right back where we were before all this was
settled in 1984,'' he said.

   The Baby Bell telephone companies, as part of
the AT&T breakup, were given the lucrative Yellow Pages business
because it was feared they would be unable to survive apart from
their parent.
   As it turns out five years later, those fears were unfounded.
   The seven Baby Bells, which carved up American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.'s local operating networks, are among the nation's
corporate giants with assets ranging from $19 billion to $27 billion
and investments in a variety of domestic and international
businesses.
   In fact, directory publishing has become such a good money-maker
that many of the Bells have removed Yellow Pages from the regulated
side of their businesses and now use those profits to support other
competitive ventures.
   ``They came out of the blocks faster than anyone anticipated,''
said Robert Morris III, a San Francisco-based telecommunications
analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co.
   Some say the Baby Bells learned to run before they learned to
walk.
   Many of their investments in the early years went sour and many
hundreds of millions of dollars were lost. Some analysts said those
investments were a sign that the companies were still acting and
thinking like regulated businesses and hadn't yet learned how to
compete in the open market.
   ``It's still too early to say the Baby Bells have outgrown the
legacy of what some people say is a bell-shaped head,'' said Michael
Dortch, an independent market analyst based in San Francisco.
   At Englewood, Colo.-based U S West Inc., Chairman Jack A.
MacAllister said his company's failed attempt at expanding its
customer equipment business beyond its 14-state region taught the
company something about competition.
   ``We didn't understand the market sufficiently and as we got into
the business, the margins disappeared,'' so the company pulled out
of the business and took a $100 million writedown in the fourth
quarter of 1986, he said.
   ``That was hard for us to take, but the good part about it was it
set a tenor for our business,'' he said. ``We made up our mind that
as we get into competition there are going to be some times we win
and some times we fail, and when we see that we made a mistake,
instead of trying to wish it would be better we try to face up to
the mistake.''
   Here, at a glance, are the seven Baby Bells:
   AMERITECH: Phone companies operate in Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. Unregulated subsidiaries in financing,
cellular and paging products and services and directory publishing.
Its 1987 net income was $1.2 billion, revenues were $9.5 billion and
assets were $18.8 billion.
   BELL ATLANTIC: Phone companies operate in Maryland, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, D.C.
Unregulated ventures include computer maintenance, equipment
leasing, data and network software, Yellow Pages and cellular
phones. Its 1987 net income was $1.2 billion on revenues of $10.3
billion with assets of $21.2 billion.
   BELLSOUTH: Phone companies operate in Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee
and Kentucky. Investments include computer leasing and maintenance
services, directory publishing, communications systems and equipment
and cellular phone and paging services. Its 1987 net income was $1.7
billion on revenues of $12 billion. With assets of $27.4 billion, it
is the largest of the Baby Bells.
   NYNEX: Phone services in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and parts of southern
Connecticut. Unregulated investments include computer and software
marketing, financial products and services, directories publishing,
cellular phone and paging services, real estate brokerage services.
In 1987, it had $1.3 billion in net income, revenues of $12.1
billion and assets of $22.8 billion.
   PACIFIC TELESIS: Phone services in California and Nevada.
Unregulated investments include cellular telephone and paging
services, directory publishing and real estate development. Its 1987
net income was $950 million, revenues were $9.1 billion and assets
$21 billion.
   SOUTHWESTERN BELL: Phone services in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Missouri and Kansas. Unregulated activities include directory
publishing, telecommunications systems marketing, cellular phone
equipment and services and paging services. Its 1987 net income was
$1 billion, revenues were $8 billion and assets $21.5 billion.
   U S WEST: Phone services in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa. Unregulated investments in
transaction-processing software, real estate, financial services,
cellular phone and paging services, directory publishing and
computer software and data base products for information management.
Its 1987 net income was $1 billion, revenues were $8.4 billion and
assets $19.1 billion.

   For five years, American Telephone & Telegraph
Co. watched passively as its long-distance competitors built their
networks and lured customers from the industry leader with lower
prices and new services.
   But the sleeping giant has begun to stir, analysts say.
   ``What you'll see is the dawning of a new age in long-distance,
beginning now, where AT&T goes from being a benevolent giant to
being a real nasty monster,'' said Jack Grubman, a PaineWebber Inc.
telecommunications analyst.
   This new aggressiveness is likely to mean slower growth for
AT&T's rivals, notably the two largest, MCI Communications Corp. and
US Sprint Communications Co., but analysts expect that the rapid
pace of this $50 billion-a-year industry will help them sustain
healthy growth.
   MCI's earnings, for example, ``will increase but instead of 385
percent this year, they will increase 88 percent next year,''
predicted Robert Morris III of Goldman, Sachs & Co. ``It's still an
awfully attractive rate of growth, and better than the market.''
   AT&T has been modernizing its network during the five years since
the Bell System was broken up Jan. 1, 1984, and offering new
services, but Grubman says that for the most part the company has
been relatively passive, letting competition take hold to justify
the divestiture.
   However, now that AT&T's overall share of the long-distance
market has slipped from close to 90 percent at divestiture into the
70 percent range, the company is sending signals that it plans to
become far more aggressive, Grubman said.
   AT&T Vice Chairman Randall L. Tobias rejects Grubman's scenario,
saying, ``We've been aggressive in everything we've done.'' However,
he said, ``the characterization that we're getting more aggressive
is fair.''
   AT&T is pushing hard for more pricing flexibility from federal
regulators to put it on the same footing as its unfettered rivals.
As part of that effort, AT&T is lobbying the Federal Communications
Commission to adopt a new regulatory structure that would set upper
and lower limits on prices.
   As it is now, rates are based on a calculation of how much profit
AT&T can make in comparison to the size of its asset base.
   AT&T also has been coming out with new products and services that
are direct responses to offerings of MCI and US Sprint.
Additionally, AT&T has been beefing up its sales and marketing staff
and recently announced plans to cut thousands of jobs and take a
$6.7 billion charge against fourth-quarter earnings to cover
expenses related to removing outdated phone equipment.
   Although the charge will result in the first annual loss in
AT&T's 103-year history, analysts said it showed the company's
determination to become more competitive.
   ``I think they are going to unleash fast and furiously a lot of
creative pricing plans, for large customers in particular, and
they'll be able to maintain high profitability because there's a lot
of costs they can shed but had no incentive to do under
(profit-limiting) rate-of-return regulation,'' Grubman said.
   With nearly 2.7 million shareowners, AT&T is still the most
widely held stock of any U.S. company.
   AT&T's earnings suffered in the first three years after
divestiture, but in 1987 a corporate refocusing helped the company
post record earnings of $2 billion, or $1.88 per share, on revenues
of $34 billion. Net income was up 8.2 percent the first nine months
of this year.
   AT&T's share of the market has dropped to around 70 percent in
terms of minutes of use of its network, but in terms of its revenues
the company commands a larger share, estimated usually at more than
75 percent, because its prices are generally higher than those of
its rivals.
   MCI, now a $6 billion-a-year company, has had a startlingly good
year, with earnings through the third quarter up nearly four-fold on
steadily rising revenues from 800 and international services and
gains in commercial accounts.
   ``MCI has become a truly viable alternative to AT&T,'' said
Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley & Co., who estimates that MCI has
about 11 percent of the long-distance business.
   According to his survey of corporate telecommunications
executives at the start of the year, 38 percent said that by 1990
they would choose MCI as their main long-distance company, compared
with 11 percent in his 1987 survey.
   US Sprint, with about $4 billion in annual revenues and an
estimated 7 percent share of the long-distance pie, is still
struggling to turn a profit. But with its nationwide fiber-optic
network complete, analysts believe it will find its footing soon.
   ``Sprint is starting'' to become a contender, Greenberg said.
``We're seeing them get large contracts with major players. If
they're not there yet, they're darn close to it.''
   AT&T, MCI and US Sprint all are looking over their shoulders at
the regional Bell operating companies, spun off from AT&T in the
divestiture and anxious to have restrictions on their businesses
lifted so they can get into the long-distance business.
   ``The most fundamental thing that could just be the biggest step
backwards on all of the positive things that have happened (since
divestiture) would be if the Bell operating companies were allowed
into long-distance,'' said Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI president.
   ``That's really the Roman candle,'' he said.

   The most important communications device at the
dawn of the 21st century will probably be one that was invented in
the 19th century: the underappreciated telephone.
   In spite of brave talk about videotex, picture phones and fiber
links to the home, the ordinary telephone will continue to hold sway
as the most important communications device in the home and office.
   Consider that the telephone, backed by a worldwide network worth
hundreds of billions of dollars, permits any person to contact any
other person simply by picking up a receiver and dialing a series of
digits.
   Nothing on the horizon promises to rival the telephone as a
device for allowing meetings of the mind, whether between corporate
chiefs or members of the Monday bridge club.
   ``We will come to realize by the year 2000 the excitement of the
telephone. We take it for granted too much,'' said Michael Noll, a
professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg
School of Communications.
   The 1984 breakup of the Bell System probably sped up the
introduction of new communications technologies, but many of the
changes would have come anyway in response to global competition and
the demands of customers.
   The telephone of the future will be more useful than the phone of
1988 because of the spread of answering machines and computerized
features such as voice mail, which allows a person to record a
message and have it stored and forwarded at will.
   Cellular phones will be so common by the year 2000 that it will
be ordinary for people to make and receive phone calls from trains,
planes and canoes.
   Facsimile machines that are hooked to the phone network will
continue to spread, cutting into the business of overnight delivery
services.
   Another old-time communication device, the television, will
continue to hold sway in the coming era, only the picture and sound
will be better. (The content will probably be about the same, for
better or worse.)
   Human nature will delay the spread of other long-promised
communications advances, much to the disappointment of technology
buffs.
   For example, the 20-year-old picture phone is likely to reach its
40th birthday without finding its way into every home, even if the
quality of the picture is much improved.
   ``The problem is not technology; it's human behavior,'' Noll
said. ``People would rather not be seen while talking on the phone.''
   Some thinkers are more optimistic about picture phones. ``I
simply cannot believe that people voluntarily will reduce the amount
of information they can get by talking to each other,'' said Eli
Noam, a member of the New York state Public Service Commission on
leave from Columbia University.
   After repeated failures, videotex is likely to find a niche. But
again, human nature will probably limit the potential of the
technology. Many people still want to deal with another person when
they bank or make airline reservations, even if it would be faster
to do it on a home terminal.
   As for getting information on a videotex terminal, the biggest
market is likely to be business-related research. The day when
people read their daily news on a terminal instead of a front page
seems far off.
   The biggest bust for the remainder of this century will probably
be the extension of glass fiber cables to homes and small
businesses. Fiber can carry thousands of times more information than
the kind of old-fashioned copper cables that have been in use for
decades, but it is not clear why the extra capacity is urgently
needed.
   Phone companies say the extra ``bandwidth'' offered by fiber
would permit companies to offer specialized services, such as
monitoring burglar alarms and thermostats from central locations.
But those services and most others could easily be handled over
existing cables.
   High-quality video is the one thing that could take advantage of
the huge capacity of fiber. But cable TV subscribers already get
video coming into their homes on a cable _ even if it does not have
quite the carrying capacity of optical fiber.
   Direct satellite broadcast is another way to deliver high-quality
video into homes without the huge cost of installing fibers. So are
improved video cassette recorders.
   Bringing fiber to the home would require replacing 52 million
miles of existing copper cables, estimated Richard J. Solomon, a
research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Media Lab.
   It will happen, he said, but probably not for 20 or 30 years.
   ``There's a horrible tendency to try to take what we have and
extend it (in making predictions). What usually happens is there's a
whole leap to a brand new technology,'' Noll said.

   Authorities plan to kill about 5,000
deer to try to halt the spread of bovine tuberculosis in commerical
deer herds, it was reported Monday.
   Agriculture Minister Laurits Toernaes applied to the parliament's
finance committee for about $3.8 million to pay for the three-year
plan, according to state television.
   Most of the money will go to farmers as compensation for lost
stocks. The animals are slaughtered for meat sold in domestic and

<HEAD>London Shares Finish Lower, But Off Lows</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with closing prices</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices finished an edgy session on the London
Stock Exchange slightly lower Monday, but well off session lows
after staging a late afternoon rally on the back of surging prices
on Wall Street.
   Shares in London were knocked back at midday on strong retail
sales figures, which raised fears of higher interest rates, while
trading became further unsettled when the first day of trading
commenced in British Steel PLC, the newly privatized steel maker.
   But Wall Street proved to be the biggest motivator of the day,
surging 33.96 points to 2,126.24 by the time the London session drew
to a close. Traders said New York players, and consequently London
players, were relieved that the U.S. Federal Reserve did not raise
its discount rate last Friday, as had been widely expected.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed off 3.4
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,761.6.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 0.7 point at 1,439.0
at the close.
   Volume was relatively strong 645.4 million shares, compared with
the 487 million shares which changed hands Friday.
   However, a large chunk of Monday's volume was turnover in British
Steel, in which 261 million shares changed hands.
   Market watchers described the first day of tra of directors: ``These
farmers are saying, `Give us the
incentive to do better, to continue to be the most productive and
efficient farmers in the world, but help us get through these tough
times.'''
   Agriculture Department economists speaking at the department's
annual outlook conference last week projected better times ahead for
farmers. Commodity prices will continue to be strong, they said,
with record-tying sales of $148 billion to $152 billion forecast.
   Farmers will be less dependent on direct government subsidies,
the economists said. Direct federal payments are forecast at $9
billion to $11 billion, reflecting in part the tightening of some
commodity supplies by this year's drought.
   The Rural Voice survey found farmers themselves divided over
specific policy alternatives as Congress begins to consider
directions for new farm legislation.
   Half of those surveyed said the government should put more effort
into non-agricultural industries and jobs in rural areas. Strong
majorities favored targeting farm program benefits to small and
medium-sized family farms (72 percent), strengthening regulations on
pesticide use (74 percent) and expanding the Conservation Reserve to
reduce use of pesticides (68 percent).
   Fifty-six percent favored higher price-support levels for crops
and 59 percent said they approve of the use of export subsidies to
protect U.S. world market share.
   A majority, 62 percent, said they support the gradual elimination
of all farm subsidies worldwide over a 10-year period if all
countries participate, but they narrowly opposed _ 50 to 42 percent
_ unilateral action to end subsidies.

   Prices rose sharply on Wall Street today as
investors, encouraged by the market's resilience in recent trading,
put aside their worries about rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks soared 31.12 to
2,123.40 as of 2 p.m. EST.
   Advancing issues led decliners by a margin of nearly 2-to-1, with
927 stocks rising, 490 falling and 505 unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 89.98 million shares at
mid-afternoon.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 1.70 to
154.72. The American Stock Exchange's market value index moved up
1.38 to 296.65.
   Analysts said the market was boosted by its own ability to
rebound from negative news.
   ``We held together fairly well Friday despite the non-farm
payroll leap,'' said Alfred Goldman, a market analyst with A.G.
Edwards Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Stock prices slipped Friday after the Labor Department reported
463,000 new jobs _ known as the non-farm payroll _ were created last
month.
   The figures indicated the economy continued to thrive, but
although the report heightened fears that the Federal Reserve would
move interest rates higher, stock prices did not fall as much as
market watchers had feared.
   ``It seems people are being encouraged by the market's
invulnerability to bad news, said Michael Metz, an analyst with
Oppenheimer & Co.
   Goldman said investors who were expecting a year-end rally on
Wall Street might be doing some early shopping. However, he warned,
``Interest rates remain very high ... I think they will dampen any
rally attempt.''
   A stable bond market and improved dollar lent support to Wall
Street today, Metz said.
   In addition, Goldman said, strength in transportation issues was
spilling over to other stocks. UAL was up 1| to 109], and AMR rose 2
to 53~.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Occidental
Petroleum, off [ at 25~.
   Big gainers included IBM, up 1~ to 121[, Ford Motor, up 1 to 52},
and Digital Equipment, up 1 to 96\.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Gets Tenders for 98 Percent of Kraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. said Monday it has nearly
completed its $12.9 billion buyout of Kraft Inc. and the creation of
the world's largest consumer products company.
   About 98 percent of Kraft's outstanding shares, or more than 117
million shares, had been tendered under Philip Morris' $106-a-share
cash offer that expired Friday, according to the tobacco and
consumer products giant.
   Philip Morris said it planned to complete the acquisition as soon
as possible, but offered no specific date.
   The merger is one of a series of recent huge deals in the food
business, capped by RJR Nabisco Inc.'s agreement last week to be
acquired by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for
nearly $25 billion.
   Philip Morris' tender offer was about 77 percent higher than the
$60 a share Kraft stock was trading at before the takeover plan was
disclosed in mid-October.
   Philip Morris initially offered $90 a share. But Kraft rejected
that as inadequate and proposed a recapitalization plan that it
valued at $110 a share, including a cash dividend of $84 a share.
   By late October, however, the two companies signed an agreement
under which Philip Morris agreed to pay $106 a share in cash for all
of Kraft's stock. The Kraft acquisition will unite two companies
that had combined sales of $37.6 billion in 1987, surpassing the
nearly $31 billion in sales reported by the Anglo-Dutch concern
Unilever NV, currently the world's biggest consumer products company.
   It also will bring well-known Kraft brands such as Miracle Whip
salad dressing, Velveeta cheese, Sealtest ice cream and Tombstone
frozen pizzas into the same corporate umbrella as Marlboro
cigarettes, Maxwell House coffee, Post cereals, Oscar Mayer meats
and Miller beer.
   Last week, the Federal Trade Commission cleared the Philip
Morris-Kraft deal, although critics argued the merger would give
Philip Morris too much power over prices, supply systems and
advertising time.
   Philip Morris denied the deal would be anti-competitive.

<TEXT>
   Soybean and corn futures closed sharply lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late sell-off led by the
Iowa Grain Co., a large, speculative trading firm, analysts said.
   Wheat futures prices also declined.
   In otherwise thin market conditions, Iowa Grain sold contracts
for future deliveries of at least 5 million bushels each of wheat,
corn and soybeans, sparking selling by other players, observers said.
   Iowa Grain had purchased the contracts on Friday while many
smaller players were selling due to forecasts for a fairly wet
weekend in the soybean-growing regions of South America.
   The South American weekend turned out to be drier than expected,
which should have given the markets a boost on Monday, analysts said.
   ``But if one big house comes in and does something very, very
large, that can have a big impact,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.14\ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 6{ cents lower with December at $2.52\ a bushel; oats were
2} cents to 4 cents lower with December at $1.91{ a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cents to 12\ cents lower with January at $7.56{ a bushel.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   A transit strike entered its fourth week Monday as
negotiations reopened with workers seeking higher wages while
commuters struggled through heavy rain.
   Two of the four regional express subway lines remained paralyzed
except for small stretches of the network.
   The transport authority said slightly more than half the
capital's bus fleet was on the street. Two subway lines were at a
standstill.
   Other subways offered service ranging from 64 percent to 85
percent of normal or were not affected at all.
   Traffic has jammed the Paris ring road and major highways into
the city as many commuters drive to work.
   Newspapers said the strike is costing $333 million a day.
Department store owners said business is down 30 percent as they
head into the Christmas season.
   Throughout autumn, nurses, postal employees, government office
workers and other public service staff have gone on strike for wages
higher than those called for in Premier Michel Rocard's policy of
economic rigor.
   Rocard aides told reporters they expect labor unrest in the
public sector to continue, even after the transit strike is settled.
   The top government official for the Ile de la France region,
which includes the Paris area, said 150,000 people are being
transported each day by private buses or the 365 army trucks orderedroadcast
said security forces dispersed about 1,500 people
in the Baku's Lenin Square Sunday night. The forces moved in after
the crowd failed to respond to appeals by the chairman of the city
council and a commandant to disperse.
   Demonstrations and meetings are banned under military law imposed
two weeks ago.
   ``Irresponsible elements among those who gathered tried to put up
resistance. The servicemen fulfilled the tasks that had been put to
them. No weapons were used,'' the broadcast said.
   Some members of the crowd were detained, Radio Moscow reported.
The broadcast did not say why the crowd had gathered or whether they
were demonstrating over the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
   Lenin Square was closed for ``sanitary work'' following the
dispersal of the meeting, according to Baku radio.
   In Yerevan, a 10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew imposed Nov. 24 was cut to 11
p.m.-5 a.m., the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda reported.
More than 2,400 people were detained and 32 were arrested since it
was imposed, Pravda said.

<HEAD>INTELSAT Executive Sentenced for Role in Kickback Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top executive of INTELSAT was
sentenced Monday to 16 months to four years imprisonment for his
role in a $4.8 million kickback scheme involving construction of the
satellite consortium's headquarters.
   In imposing the sentence, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
said Jose L. Alegrett, former deputy director general of INTELSAT,
would receive credit for the five months he has been in custody
since his arrest in Aruba last summer.
   Gesell, noting the defendant's cooperation with a continuing
federal investigation of alleged corruption by former INTELSAT
executives, said he would recommend that Alegrett be paroled after
serving 11 months.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David F. Geneson told Gesell that since
his arrest as a fugitive last summer, Alegrett ``has cooperated with
the government in a very substantial manner.''
   Alegrett has not only aided the government's investigation of the
construction kickback scheme but was providing information of
``great value'' for a probe of ``two other areas,'' Geneson said.
   Geneson was referring to an investigation of allegations that
consultants hired by two communications satellite manufacturers,
Hughes Aircraft Co., and Ford Aerospace Corp., had paid kickbacks to
former INTELSAT officials.
   Defense attorney Alan Bayles told the court of a letter from
General Motors Corp., which owns Hughes Aircraft, citing Alegrett's
cooperation.
   Alegrett pleaded guilty Sept. 16 to interstate transportation of
money obtained by fraud in connection with the kickback scheme.
   As part of the plea, Alegrett paid INTELSAT $1.1 million in
restitution, according to a source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The case stemmed from a scheme by INTELSAT's director general,
Richard R. Colino, Alegrett and two businessmen to siphon $3.8
million to $4.8 million in kickbacks from construction contracts to
build the consortium's new world headquarters.
   INTELSAT, acronym for the International Telecommunications
Satellite Organization, provides a global communications network
with satellites that serve 114 member nations.
   Gesell told Alegrett that the sentence was intended to punish
rather than rehabilitate him. ``I think you are a man who comes from
a tradition of honor,'' Gesell said.
   But ``this was not a case of a simple mistake,'' Gesell said.
``This was a deliberately, continuing, conniving scheme carried out
with deceit.''
   Alegrett was arrested last July in Aruba, where he had traveled
from his native Venezuela to meet with a federal agent. Aruban
authorities agreed to arrest Alegrett on a U.S. warrant, which was
issued after lengthy plea negotiations with federal prosecutors had
been broken off.
   Colino is serving a six-year term for criminal fraud and
conspiracy. He has denied knowledge of kickbacks by Hughes or Ford
Aerospace.
   But the civil suit filed by INTELSAT againt Colino charges that
he and an associate arranged for Ford Aerospace to hire a Chilean
consulting firm to perform a study to forecast satellite demand.
   Of the $125,000 that the firm was to be paid, Colino arranged for
him and an associate to receive $100,000, according to the lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   A federal jury found Monday that the Long Island
Lighting Co. and a former executive engaged in a pattern of lies to
obtain rate increases to help pay for its Shoreham nuclear power
plant.
   The verdict under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations statute awards $22.8 million in damages to Suffolk
County and could make Lilco liable for $1.8 billion if the trial
judge certifies the suit a class action on behalf of all ratepayers.
   The utility, through its attorney Michael Lesch, immediately
issued a one-sentence statement that said the verdict was
``insupportable'' and that Lilco would seek to set it aside or
reverse it on appeal.
   The seven-member jury in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn found
that Lilco and a former president, Wilfred O. Uhl, violated the RICO
statute by lying to the Public Service Commission on three occasions
about the completion schedule of Shoreham in order to obtain rate
hikes.
   The verdict followed a two-month trial of the county's civil
racketeering suit against Lilco. The jury awarded $7.6 million in
damages to the county for what it overpaid on utility costs because
of fraudulently obtained rate increases in 1978 and 1984.
   That amount is tripled to $22.8 million under the federal
racketeering statue. The county had sought up to $72 million in
damages.
   The jury rejected the county's charges that Lilco deceived the
PSC in obtaining other rate increases in 1975, 1976, 1979 and 1981.
   It also found no violations by three other former Lilco officials
who were defendants.
   ``I think the jury spoke loud and clearly that Lilco had been
engaging in a pattern of fraud for a decade,'' said Kenneth
McCallion, who was the county's lead attorney during the two-month
trial.
   ``A verdict in this case has to send a message to all parties
that the fraud engaged in by Lilco has to be a major factor for
those who are considering the fate of Shoreham,'' McCallion said.
   Last week in Albany, the state legislature let pass by a deadline
for approving a plan that would keep Shoreham closed and give Lilco
5 percent annual rate hikes over the next decade.
   Lilco has said that while the plan could be revived, it would
proceed toward licensing the plant.
   Suffolk County Executive Patrick Halpin called the verdict ``a
great victory for the county and Suffolk's ratepayers.''
   According to testimony at the trial, the Shoreham plant, which is
located 55 miles east of Manhattan, had originally been scheduled to
be in operation in 1978 at a cost of $77 million. Construction was
completed in 1985, but the plant was never opened because of public
opposition.
   The county alleged that Lilco spent $8 billion in the
construction of Shoreham, but Lilco says the plant cost $5.3 billion.
   Originally, the county had wanted to make the suit a class action
on behalf of all Lilco customers, but U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein limited the scope of the suit before the trial started.
   After the verdict, Weinstein said he would now accept a motion
asking him to certify the class and indicated that if he granted the
request, Lilco could be liable for up to $1.8 billion.

<TEXT>
   Democrats called Social Security officials on
the carpet Monday over draft regulations to limit the rights of
people trying to obtain benefits, even though Commissioner Dorcas
Hardy already killed the controversial proposal.
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
said the plan would have violated Congress' intent that the benefits
hearings process be ``non-adversarial and simple enough for an
individual claimant to navigate without legal representation.''
   He said that based on past actions, he feared what steps the
agency might take in the future.
   Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., said: ``The administration does not have
a track record on Social Security that I feel comfortable with.
There's suspicion.''
   Downey, acting chairman of the public assistance subcommittee,
cited an instance last Christmas when he said the Reagan
administration ``tried to count as income the blankets and food that
poor (Social Security) recipients might get from local charities.''
   Hardy over the weekend rejected the draft staff regulations, one
of which would have required claimants to submit all evidence in a
proceeding at least seven days before it began.
   Deputy Commissioner Louis Enoff assured the Ways and Means
Committee on Monday that Hardy's decision was final.
   ``They've been tossed,'' Enoff said of the regulations. ``They
will not be considered or started (anew). They will not officially
be brought forward in the Social Security Administration.''
   Most of the 300,000 people who request hearings each year before
administrative law judges are seeking disability benefits, and most
who appeal denials eventually win. An appeal through the
administrative process to the court level takes an average of nearly
two years.
   Under questioning by Downey, Enoff denied that the draft
regulations were developed to cut the number of appeals. ``Our
primary concern is getting the correct decision at the earliest
point in the process,'' he said. He said 110 administrative law
judges were added last year, bringing the total to more than 700.
   Republicans complained bitterly that the hearing was unnecessary
in light of Hardy's action and inconvenient since it was held while
GOP members met to elect leaders for the 101st Congress.
   ``I must conclude that the majority is unwilling to let the media
down,'' said Rep. Hal Daub, R-Neb. He said even without Hardy's
action, given the glacial pace of regulatory change, the hearing
would have been premature.
   Downey defended the hearing, saying Congress is ``extraordinarily
sensitive'' to any Social Security changes and ``brooks no effort''
to instill among the elderly and disabled fear of their own
government.
   ``The people who did these draft regulations were not out to
intimidate or hurt anybody,'' Enoff replied. He said one reason for
proposing the advance evidence requirement is that some lawyers
introduce evidence at the end of a proceeding simply to prolong it,
because they make more money that way.
   He said the system remains targeted for change and he challenged
committee members to ask other witnesses, most of them from senior
advocacy groups, ``if they would deny that the hearings and appeals
process sorely needs improving.''
   In testimony to the committee, many groups agreed the process
needed to be improved. The most common suggestion was that the
Social Security Administration hire more people in order to better
determine the validity of disability claims when they are first made.
   And several witnesses said administrative law judges need more
independence from the Social Security bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Kodak Cites Advance In Electronic Photography</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. Monday announced the
development of a new computer chip that it claims will vastly
improve the quality of electronically-generated photos.
   The chip was immediately hailed as an advance in the race with
the Japanese to integrate photographic technology with computers.
   Industry analyst Jacques Kauffmann said the chip dramatically
improves the clarity of electronically-generated images and may
shorten the time it takes to make that technology available to
consumers.
   Kodak has made its fortune in silver halide photography, a
technology that requires an image to be captured on film.
   But since the early 1970s, it has been working on electronic
photography, which captures images on a computer disk that converts
the image into electrons.
   Companies that are working on electronic photography haven't
marketed it widely to consumers because they haven't been able to
develop a sensor with enough picture elements, also called pixels.
The more pixels, the sharper the picture, so few pixels has meant
mediocre picture quality.
   The sensor that Kodak introduced Monday has 4 million pixels,
twice as many as the best available up to now.
   Kauffmann said the picture quality of 4 million pixels is
comparable to the quality of prints from 110 film. Kodak spokesman
Timothy Hughes said it is 11{ times the quality of a camcorder image
and twice the clarity of high-definition television pictures.
   Last spring, Japan's NEC Corp. and Toshiba announced a
2-million-pixel prototype. The best available before that was
Kodak's own 1.4-million-pixel sensor, introduced in 1986. The
picture quality of a 1.4-million-pixel image is comparable to that
of Kodak's disc camera, Kauffmann said.
   But he cautioned that there is a big gap between commercial and
consumer applications.
   ``It's far from being a consumer level product,'' Kauffmann said.
   Kodak has said that its main thrust right now is to continue to
develop its conventional film so the picture quality stays ahead of
electronic photography. Its top-of-the-line Ektar film, introduced
in October, is evidence of that effort.
   And Hughes said the cost of this 4-million-pixel sensor makes
consumer applications prohibitively expensive. He said Kodak won't
discuss the sensor's cost until next spring.
   When the prototype becomes available early next year, followed by
product introduction in the middle of the year, Kodak expects about
a dozen customers from science, government and industry to be
interested, Hughes said. He said customers probably will use the
technology to take an electronic picture of a photograph so they can
look at it on a computer screen and transmit it to other computers.

<HEAD>No Instant Profit on First Day Of Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   British Steel PLC's shares rose in active trading
Monday as they began changing hands, but dealers said the gain was
disappointing because it was not big enough to bring instant profit
to small investors, as past privatizations have.
   The shares immediately rose to 62.25 pence, or $1.16, up 2.25
pence, or 4 cents, from the partly paid offering price, soon after
trading began at 2:30 p.m. on London's Stock Exchange. They finished
the session at that early level.
   Volume amounted to 261 million shares.
   The British Steel shares were priced at 125 pence, or $2.34 each,
valuing the entire company at 2.5 billion pounds, or the equivalent
of $4.7 billion. But the shares were offered on an installment basis
with an initial payment of 60 pence, or $1.12 a share.
   The offering was more than three times oversubscribed, the
government said. Private investors made around 650,000 applications
for more than 1.5 billion shares, compared with the 452 million
shares on offer to them.
   The government decided to allocate 842 million shares to the
private investors, or 42 percent of the total 2 billion shares, by
cutting the size of the portions which had been provisionally placed
with British and overseas institutions.
   Market watchers described the first day of trading in British
Steel as ``anti-climactic'' and ``much ado about nothing.''
   Dealers said the premium was disappointing because it was too
small to give private investors any profit by selling their shares
on the first day of dealing, after taking dealing costs into account.
   Trading activity was mainly due to buying and selling among
institutions, with some of the issue's British sub-underwriters
seeking to reduce their holdings somewhat on the first day of
dealing, dealers said.
   ``At the moment we are seeing selling from those U.K.
institutions that were happy to underwrite the issue but aren't
long-term holders, and buying from the institutions that are more
optimistic,'' one senior dealer said.
   Dealers said some participants were discouraged by Monday's
overall fall in prices on the stock market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed off 3.4
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,761.6.
   Meanwhile, advisers to the government, the investment firm Samuel
Montagu and Co., said they were investigating around 2,000 of the
650,000 applications put in by private British investors for
suspected multiple applications. It's illegal to put in more than
one application for shares in Britian's privatizations.

   Steel importers conceded Monday that they are
unlikely to win a repeal of import quotas and proposed ways to make
the program more palatable.
   ``We're trying to be realistic,'' said John Griffin, newly
elected president of the American Institute for Imported Steel.
   The New York-based importers association, the Texas Association
of Steel Importers and the West Coast Metal Importers Association
said President-elect George Bush should, among other things, soften
the strict product-by-product quotas that created shortages over the
last two years.
   The more than 30 product quotas prevented foreign producers from
shipping additional steel plate for factory floors and bridge decks,
for example, when U.S. producers could not meet demand.
   ``We've seen projects where they leave holes in the deck because
you can't get plate,'' said Griffin, who is also president of the
Houston steel trader Maurice Pincoffs Co.
   The U.S. quotas, negotiated by the Reagan administration starting
in 1984, were designed to limit foreign steel to roughly 20 percent
of the U.S. market.
   Domestic steel companies contend they still need protection as
the U.S. industry restructures, but steel users are urging the
quotas be dropped.
   Known as ``voluntary restraint agreements,'' the quotas ``ignore
the interests of consumers of steel-intensive produces (and) brought
about market shortages and price increases, reduced net
manufacturing employment in the United States and diminished the
potential for the export of steel-intenive products,'' the importers
association said in a statement.
   American steelmakers deny any connection between the quotas and
steel price increases, and they deny there have been any true
shortages. Only a renewal of the quotas will check predatory trade
practices and allow time to continue the turnaround that has brought
the domestic industry profits of $3.25 billion in the last seven
quarters after losses of $12 billion over the preceding five years,
they say.
   The importers said that barring a change of heart by Bush, they
prefer the quota plan to the unfair trade complaints that U.S.
producers say they will file if the current five-year program is
allowed to expire on schedule in September. Bush has said he favors
continuing the quota system.
   ``The alternative was to either have this type of organized,
orderly market or to have a series of harrassments such as the ones
that led to this quota, ... the counterveiling duty case or the
dumping case, and they are poison,'' said Fred Lamesch, a past
president of the importers association.
   Counterveiling duties can be levied against imports shown to have
damaged U.S. competitors as a result of unfair pricing. Dumping is
the practice of exporting goods at prices set artificially below the
cost of production.
   U.S. producers say both tactics aggravated their 1982-86
recession, during which they were forced to slash employment by
roughly half to today's 170,000 workers.
   Lamesch said none of the top steel-exporting nations have granted
any steel production subsidies for several years. The only subsidies
still available to European producers are those that help pay
employee benefits when plants close, he said.
   ``The French say America has the biggest subsidy by being able to
give pink slips to workers on Friday and say `Don't come back on
Monday,''' said Hans Mueller, an economist professor at Middle
Tennessee State University who is a cosultant for the importers
group.
   ``Most of the subsidies are optical illusions,'' Mueller said.
``We see subsidies in anything different than what we do.''
   With the Bush inauguration still six weeks away and with nine
months remaining before the quotas are scheduled to expire, American
steel users already are complaining that the domestic steel industry
seems too prosperous to be demanding further trade protection.
   ``Our guys would kill to be making the profit on sales that
they're making right now,'' Greg Estell, spokesman for the 1,000
member companies of the Precision Metal Forming Association, said
Friday.
   The Cleveland-based organization represents 80,000 of the
approximately 350,000 Americans who bend, stamp and cut steel into
parts for vehicles, appliances and other products. That
steel-consuming niche alone has more than twice as many employees as
basic steelmaking.
   Others demanding changes or abandonment of the quotas include the
Steel Service Center Institute, the Forging Industry Association and
the heavy equipment manufacturers Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Co.

<HEAD>Pepperell Sweetens Retirement Plan For Hundreds Of Employees,
Blasts Farley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textile giant West Point-Pepperell Inc. is
offering more than 800 employees early retirement in an effort to
trim down the company, which has grown through the acquisition of
two competitors.
   The company says the program is not connected to its efforts to
thwart a $1.4 billion takeover attempt by Chicago-based Farley Inc.
   A company spokesman said the offer would affect between 800 and
900 salaried Pepperell employees, including those who came from
Cluett, Peabody & Co., acquired in 1986, and from J.P. Stevens & Co.
Inc., acquired this year.
   The spokesman said the plan, which offers enhanced retirement
benefits to employees aged 55 with 10 years service, is not
connected with the Farley bid.
   The offer is being made ``in the normal course of business,'' the
spokesman said. ``It's something that had been looked at for quite a
while when they were looking at the need to cut back staff.''
   Pepperell, based in West Point, Ga., has 41,000 employees and is
the nation's largest publicly held textile company.
   Farley, whose privately held conglomerate includes the maker of
Fruit of the Loom underwear, is engaged in a month-long battle with
Pepperell management to buy up the company for $48 per share tender
offer.
   The latest volley in the battle also came Monday as Farley took
out full-page advertisements in several newspapers including The
Atlanta Journal, The Atlanta Constitution and The New York Times
claiming ``management's most important objective is to entrench
management, not to do what's right for the owners of more than 99
percent of West Point-Pepperell shares not owned by management.''
   The advertisement attacked Pepperell's handling of Cluett and
Stevens, claiming both companies had deteriorated since their
acquisition by Pepperell.
   The ad was in reply to a similar effort two weeks ago by
Pepperell saying in part, ``Why turn a healthy, thriving, globally
competitive company like West Point-Pepperell into another
money-losing Farley enterprise?''
   Pepperell has failed in several court attempts to block the
Farley offer, claiming it violates federal regulations because it
involves too much debt and not enough equity.
   Farley owns 9.8 percent of Pepperell's outstanding shares, and
the company said last week it had been tendered enough stock to push
its stake to more than 49 percent of the company. The offer, which
is contingent on the overturning of Pepperell's shareholder rights
provisions, expires at midnight Wednesday.
   A federal appeals court has set a January hearing to decide on
the challenge to the shareholder rights.
   Farley also has asked for a special shareholder meeting to vote
on the offer.

<TEXT>
   The United States is presenting itself as the
hero of free trade in agricultural products at talks here, but its
own record is hardly unblemished.
   The United States has import quotas on sugar and on dairy
products such as butter and cheese. It also limits imports of beef
from nations such as Australia and New Zealand through ``voluntary''
restraint agreements.
   The United States will spend about $13 billion in the coming year
for subsidies to farmers through price supports, export subsidies
and other programs.
   Although that level of support is about half of recent levels,
the drop is the result of a recent rise in world food prices, not
fundamental reform. Costs would shoot back up if plentiful world
harvests depressed world prices.
   The most conspicuous example of protectionism is on sugar, where
domestic producers with strong clout in Washington have managed to
obtain approval of import quotas that keep prices high by
restricting the supply.
   Because of quotas, American consumers pay about twice the
prevailing world price for sugar.
   This is not a rough estimate: On the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange in New York, the bulk price for sugar for January delivery
is currently 11 cents a pound outside the United States and 22 cents
a pound inside the United States.
   In addition to hurting U.S. consumers, the import quotas hurt
sugar exporters such as the Philippines, the Dominican Republic and
Brazil, which need the dollars in part to pay interest on loans from
U.S. banks.
   ``We're basically shutting these countries, most of which are
friendly and dependent on us, from our market,'' said Dale Hathaway,
a former undersecretary of agriculture.
   The European Economic Community has more extensive protection and
subsidies of farmers than the United States does.
   But Japan, which Americans often regard as highly protectionist
on agriculture, will have a fairly open market after a recent
liberalization of beef and citrus imports goes into effect. Rice
will be the only remaining food that Japan heavily protects.
   ``You're dealing with an area where there are no puritans, only
sinners,'' said Hathaway, a member of the International Policy
Council on Agriculture and Trade.

   The Pentagon awarded a contractor team led by
the Martin Marietta Corp. a $347 million contract on Monday in a key
step toward conducting ``Star Wars'' laser experiments in space.
   The 30-month contract represents a major installment in what is
to be a $1.5 billion program code-named ``Zenith Star.''
   Martin Marietta's Denver Aerospace Division and its two
subcontractors have been told to proceed with the final design and
development work on a small laser and associated equipment that
could be boosted into space for experimental firing in 1994, the
Pentagon said in a statement.
   Zenith Star involves research aimed at proving the feasibility of
firing laser beams at orbiting mirrors, which in turn direct the
beam to moving targets.
   The Martin Marietta team was selected over two competitors in
October 1987 to produce a plan for Star Wars experiments that would
prove space-based laser weapons are feasible. The two subcontractors
are the Lockheed Missile and Space Co. and TRW Inc.
   The Star Wars program, known formally as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, is a research effort aimed at developing various exotic
weapons that could be used to automatically shoot down nuclear
ballistic missiles fired at the United States or its allies.

   Manufacturers improved their productivity at an
annual rate of more than 5 percent in the third quarter, the
government said Monday, but other businesses had more difficulty in
keeping increases in their labor costs below the rate of inflation.
   The Labor Department reported a 5.2 percent increase in
productivity on assembly lines. A 7.2 percent jump in annual output
was accompanied by only a 1.8 percent jump in employment and
overtime to accomplish it.
   The net productivity figure is usually close but not identical to
the difference between output and costs because it is computed
differently.
   Businesses as a whole did not fare as well, continuing a trend
that began with the recovery from the 1981-82 recession and offering
little hope for raising the nation's living standards.
   Productivity among non-farm businesses _ including the service
sector that now accounts for about half of the nation's economic
activity _ improved by just 1.9 percent on 3.4 percent higher output
and a 1.5 percent rise in hours worked.
   Over the past 12 months, non-farm business productivity has risen
by only 0.9 percent, compared with 0.8 percent for all of 1987. That
is one-third the rate in 1983, the first year coming out of the
recession, and half the rates of 1984 and 1986.
   ``It's pretty puny,'' said Michael Evans, who runs an economic
forecasting firm in Washington. ``The ability to raise our standard
of living is hardly improving at all. That's the real effect of the
budget deficits and these leveraged buyouts (of corporations).
   ``We're spending all these billions on interest payments instead
of capital improvements, research and development and
infrastructure,'' he said. ``That's our major economic problem and
we don't seem to be attacking it.''
   Still, the 1.9 percent improvement in efficiency was better than
the 1.3 percent estimated earlier, before the government last week
revised the nation's gross national product upward for the third
quarter. It also nearly offset a 2.4 percent decline in productivity
in the second quarter.
   ``It's a strong number when you consider that, traditionally,
productivity tends to level off when we get close to full
utilization'' of labor and plant resources, said Robert Lawrence, an
economist for the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
   ``It suggests that the improvement is coming from innovation
instead of just using idle resources more fully,'' Lawrence said.
   Hourly compensation costs, led by what analysts said were larger
wage gains among lower-paid service workers and higher Social
Security taxes on employers, rose at an annual rate of 5.6 percent
in the third quarter and are 4.9 percent above what they were a year
ago.
   That raised unit labor costs in the non-farm business sector for
the third quarter at an annual rate of 3.7 percent. Including a 6.8
percent annual rise the second quarter and a 5.4 percent jump the
last three months of 988, labor costs are now 4 percent above what
they were a year ago, barely below the 4.4 percent increase in
consumer prices over the same period.
   ``This is a distinctive sign of worse inflation to come and
growing pressure on profit margins,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for the Boston Co., a New York financial consulting house.
   The 5.2 percent increase in more narrow category of manufacturing
productivity was the best improvement since a 5.5 percent gain in
the spring of 1987.
   Other Labor Department data show that assembly-line hiring slowed
considerably over the summer, with only a net gain of 5,000 new
factory jobs in the third quarter, compared with 425,000 new jobs
over the past year.
   Analysts attributed much of the slowdown in assembly-line hiring
to the drought, which caused canneries and other food-processing
operations to add fewer employees than normal after harvests.
   With the creation of 160,000 new factory jobs in October and
November and assembly line workers continuing to average four hours
of overtime each week, Sinai said manufacturing productivity
improvements also are bound to fade soon.
   ``No matter what the increase in GNP in the fourth quarter, there
will be a huge increase in hours worked and labor costs, and we
haven't even had any strong wage bargaining yet,'' he said. ``This
is probably the last of the good news.''
   The Labor Department data showed hourly employee compensation
costs in manufacturing rising at an annual rate of 4.7 percent in
the third quarter, compared with an annualized gain of only 3
percent in the spring.
   However, after accounting for inflation, factory workers saw no
increase in their purchasing power from the compensation gains. And,
over the past year, they actually have lost 0.3 percent in buying
power despite nominal wage and benefit gains of 3.8 percent, the
Labor Department said.
   Still, the increased productivity enabled factories to reduce
their unit labor costs by one-half of one percent in the third
quarter after a 0.7 percent decline in the second quarter.
   And over the past 12 months, the labor costs associated with each
item coming off an assembly line are up only 0.4 percent. They had
declined by 1.2 percent in 1987, when the United States, Japan and
France were the only three major industrialized nations to reduce
unit labor costs in manufacturing from 1986.

<HEAD>South American Forecasts Pressure Soybean Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices dipped sharply Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a sell-off led by a single large trading
company and apparently linked to forecasts for rain in Brazil.
   On other markets, futures prices for oil and precious metals
futures declined while stock-index and pork futures advanced and
cattle futures were mixed.
   Soybean and corn futures sustained deeper losses than the wheat
market on the Board of Trade, with a strong line-up of export
tenders supporting wheat futures, analysts said.
   In otherwise thin market conditions, Iowa Grain Co., a large,
speculative trading firm, was said to have sold contracts
representing about 5 million bushels each of wheat, corn and
soybeans and hundreds of metric tons of soybean meal and soybean oil.
   Thomas Cunningham, president of the Chicago-based company, could
not be reached for comment. But observers said Iowa Grain had
purchased the contracts on Friday while many smaller players were
selling due to forecasts for a fairly wet weekend in Brazil, the
world's second-largest soybean producer after the United States.
   South America's weather has been unusually dry during the ongoing
planting period and has become a driving force in the U.S. soybean
futures market.
   Brazil's weekend turned out to be drier than expected, which
should have given the markets a boost on Monday, analysts said.
   ``But if one big house comes in and does something very, very
large, that can have a big impact,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Frank Kuba, a Chicago-based grain analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said some meteorologists were predicting more rain in
South America this week and that those forecasts may have sparked
the sell-off.
   ``Our forecasters did not agree with that but the market got wind
of some other forecasts,'' he said.
   Slack export demand for soybeans and some light farmer selling
also pressured the market but speculative selling was the dominant
factor, said Mario Balletto, soybean market analyst with Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   ``I think you just saw the buyers on Friday _ which was buying in
case there were weather problems this week in Brazil _ turning
around and selling it back now that there is some rain in the
forecast,'' Balletto said.
   Wheat settled 5 cents to 6\ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.13} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 6\
cents lower with December at $2.52{ a bushel; oats were 3\ cents to
4\ cents lower with December at $1.91 a bushel; soybeans were 3
cents to 12 cents lower with January at $7.56} a bushel.
   Oil futures prices declined on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in quiet trading dominated by technical factors.
   ``There was no news to speak of in the marketplace
(and)...trading appeared to be technically generated,'' said Bob
Baker, senior energy analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 30 cents to 38 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in January at $15.34 a barrel;
heating oil was 0.60 cent to 0.78 cent lower with January at 48.36
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.75 cent to 1.13 cents lower
with January at 44.44 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures prices fell modestly on New York's
Commodity Exchange with gold for February delivery unable to
penetrate technical resistance at $436.70 a troy ounce, Friday's
settlement price.
   ``Actually, I'm kind of surprised it didn't sell off more than it
did,'' said Richard Levine, vice president of precious metals and
foreign exchange trading with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Gold settled $2.40 to $2.50 lower with February at $434.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 3 cents lower with March at $6.31 a
troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting a lessening of investor worries about rising
interest rates, analysts said.
   The contract for March delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 3.50 points higher at 278.95. Each point is worth $500.
   Pork futures gained on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
expectations for falling slaughter levels and rising cash prices for
the rest of the year, analysts said.
   Cattle futures finished mixed with selling interest linked to
weak cash markets and buying due to ideas that the markets were
oversold.
   Live cattle settled 0.10 cent lower to 0.13 cent higher with
December at 71.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.20 cent lower
to 0.23 cent higher with January at 82.55 cents a pound; hogs were
0.23 cent to 0.65 cent higher with December at 40.77 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 0.10 cent to 0.35 cent higher with February
at 45.57 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Utility to End Nuclear Operations at Fort St. Vrain Power Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS M. SEARLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public Service Co. of Colorado announced Monday it
plans to end nuclear operations by June 30, 1990, at the
problem-ridden Fort St. Vrain power plant, the nation's only
helium-cooled nuclear reactor.
   A decision on whether to convert the plant to a fossil fuel
facility will be made before the end of 1989, utility spokesman Mark
Sieverts said.
   ``Don't leave the impression that the plant could be shut down
tomorrow. Our plans are to run it through 1989 and into 1990,''
Sieverts said.
   PSC earlier had announced that if it could not find third-party
assistance to continue operating the plant as a nuclear facility, it
would cease nuclear operations in 1991 or 1992. The plant is
licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate through
2008.
   Sieverts said decommissioning of the nuclear power plant could
take up to 55 years. ``The initial work is just four to five years
and then it sits for the dismantling process which would be about 55
years down the road.''
   Fort St. Vrain employs a unique helium-cooled reactor found in
France but not elsewhere in the United States, and the plant has had
a troubled history since it began providing electricity in 1976.
   The 330-megawatt facility 35 miles north of Denver never was
allowed by the NRC to operate for any length of time at 100 percent
of capacity because of problems that caused numerous shutdowns.
   A spate of equipment problems in 1984 led to the plant being shut
down for 22 months. In July 1986, NRC Commissioner James Asselstine
told a congressional subcommittee Fort St. Vrain was one of the 10
worst-run nuclear power plants in the nation.
   In the fall of 1986, PSC executives ordered a $101 million
writedown of the facility, and in October 1987 a fire in the turbine
building caused millions of dollars worth of damage.
   The plant has been shut down since last July for scheduled
repairs on its four helium circulator units. It is expected to
resume electricity generation in January.
   PSC had said earlier it had three options for Fort St. Vrain's
future: Shut down the plant and remove everything of use; convert it
to a coal- or gas-fired facility, or find a third party interested
in taking over the plant. Sieverts said the company is now left with
the first two options.
   How many of the 520 jobs associated with the nuclear power plant
will be lost in 1990 has not yet been determined, Sieverts said.
   In a prepared statement, R.O. Williams, PSC's senior vice
president of nuclear operations, said ``...we will not be able to
retain our entire (plant) workforce after we discontinue nuclear
operations.''
   Williams said he would meet with plant employees Tuesday to
outline the general plan.
   Once nuclear operations end, defueling and decommission
activities will begin, officials said Monday.
   Defueling involves removing fuel from the reactor core and
shipping the spent fuel to a federal storage site.
   Decommissioning includes removing and shipping major reactor
components and providing security for safe storage until the reactor
can be dismantled and the facility released to unrestricted use.
   ``We do have one fuel cell at the plant site that we do not plan
to load into the reactor,'' said Sieverts. ``We're looking at the
options of what to do with that unused fuel. It's a one-of-a-kind
technology and that fuel is also one-of-a-kind fuel. It would have
to be reprocessed'' for use in other reactors, he said.

   Stock prices advanced broadly Monday as
investors, responding to the market's resilience in recent sessions,
temporarily put aside their worries about rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 31.48 to
2,123.76.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 12-to-7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
929 issues up, 540 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 144.66 million shares,
down from 124.61 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
185.93 million shares.
   Analysts said there was no specific news to spark Monday's rally,
but that the market's oversold condition and recent performance were
reason enough for many investors to go on a shopping spree.
   ``They're looking for an excuse to get back in,'' said Hugh
Johnson, a market analyst at First Albany Corp. ``When it seems
oversold, when it seems like pessimism is lopsided, those who have
been in the business instinctively want to get back in.''
   ``They're looking for events that will serve as a catalyst to
move the market on the upside,'' he said.
   The market was boosted by its own ability to rebound from
negative news, in particular, the Labor Department's announcement
Friday that 463,000 new jobs were created in November, analysts said.
   The government's figures indicated the economy continues to surge
and they heightened fears that the Federal Reserve would raise its
discount rate to control the economy and inflation.
   But prices on Wall Street fell only moderately on Friday, and
that encouraged traders to enter the market Monday, said Alfred
Goldman, a market analyst with A.G. Edwards Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Goldman said investors who were expecting a year-end stock rally
might be doing some early shopping, but the specter of rising
interest rates has not vanished from Wall Street _ even if it was
pushed into the background Monday.
   ``Meanwhile, the major sword of Damocles hanging over the market
is the fact that interest rates remain very high,'' Goldman said.
   Four major companies announced plans Monday to offer their
shareholders a chance to exchange more than $5 billion in stock for
a new type of security that can be traded whole or broken into three
parts.
   The announcement was a catalyst for some of Monday's buying,
Johnson said.
   The stocks of the four companies finished higher. American
Express was up | to 27{, Dow Chemical rose 2 to 86[, Pfizer picked
up 1~ to close at 58, and Sara Lee, which was up ~ to 45].
   Transportation issues were among the big winners, and lent
strength to the rest of the market, Goldman said. UAL was up 1} to
109{, and AMR rose 2[ to 54.
   Other gainers included IBM, up 1| to 120~, General Motors, up 2[
to 85}, and Dupont, which rose 1] to 82\.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Occidental
Petroleum, which slipped [ to 25~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose by $23.172 billion, or 0.86
percent, in value.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.46 to 154.48.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 3.76 to 316.92, and S&P's
500-stock composite index picked up 3.12 to close at 274.93.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.50 to 375.41.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up
1.48 to 296.75.

   The dollar generally strengthened late Monday but
fell against the British pound, which surged on London press
speculation that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
wanted a more expensive currency.
   Gold prices slipped in New York after rising in Europe. Republic
Bank of New York quoted bullion at $428.05 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EST, down from $430.50 at the same time Friday.
   Foreign exchange brokers said the dollar's upward move came late
in the day after it fell in European dealings, staying in a narrow
range all day. They described trading as extremely light, thereby
exaggerating the influence of what few buyers and sellers were
participating.
   ``There's really been very little activity,'' said David Jacques,
senior trader on the corporate desk at the New York branch of
Britain's Barclay's Bank. ``There were a couple of orders pushing it
up.''
   Traders said action was more exciting in the pound, based on what
they called British press speculation that the government was
willing to see that currency rise by about 5 percent in value.
   A more expensive pound theoretically would pressure Britain's
exporters and make them less willing to grant what the government
considers inflationary wage demands from workers, the press accounts
suggested. Traders interpreted this as a signal to buy pounds
aggressively.
   In London it cost $1.8690 to buy one pound, up from $1.8597 late
Friday. In New York the pound fetched $1.8683, up from $1.8655, and
at times was trading above $1.87, the highest level in months. The
pound's strength raised the prospect of a $1.90 exchange rate soon,
traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 121.53 Japanese yen, down from
121.64. Later in London the dollar traded lower at 121.25 yen, but
strengthened in New York to 121.56 yen, vs. 121.20 yen late Friday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. rates late Friday,
included: 1.7260 West German marks, up from 1.7220; 1.4442 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4415; 1.1867 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1857;
5.8875 French francs, up from 5.8850; and 1,275.45 Italian lire, up
from 1,274.25.
   Other late-dollar rates in Europe vs. rates late Friday,
included: 1.7225 West German marks, down from 1.7315; 1.4420 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4598; 5.8800 French francs, down from 5.9200;
1.9425 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9490; 1,273.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,279.50; and 1.1851 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1869.
   Gold traders said bullion prices fell in New York and rose in
Europe largely because of internal market influences and not outside
news.
   The New York Commodity Exchange quoted gold for current delivery
at $429.30 a troy ounce, down $2.40 from Friday. In London gold rose
$3.25 an ounce to $428.75; in Zurich it rose $4.70 to $429; and in
Hong Kong it fell 86 cents to $429.94.
   Silver for current delivery traded at $6.163 a troy ounce, off
2.7 cents. In London silver traded at $6.14, up one cent.

<HEAD>Urban Water System Managers Urged to Seek Advice on Greenhouse
Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urban water system managers have taken limited
action in response to the greenhouse effect, say a panel of
scientists who on Monday urged the managers to seek scientific
advice.
   ``Urban water managers say they are not going to act, and you
can't blame them until they see it with their own eyes or the
professional bodies are in agreement,'' said Paul E. Waggoner,
co-chairman of a committee on climate and the management of U.S.
water resources convened by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   Waggoner is also director of the Connecticut Agricultural
Experiment Station at New Haven.
   Interviews with officials at nine water systems found only one
minor action taken out of concern for the warming of the earth or
the ``greenhouse effect'' _ the relocation of a discharge pipe in
New York City.
   Among the committee's recommendations were, ``Organizations of
professional water resource managers ... should meet formally and
regularly with scientists concerned with water and climate change.''
   The report also said, ``Practical managers must decide upon
actions now with consequences several decades hence, after some
expected climatic changes have occurred.''
   The report did not identify the water system managers interviewed
but said some of them were located in the District of Columbia, New
York, Massachusetts, Indiana, Louisiana, Utah and Arizona.
   The scientists found in their interviews that ``overall, the most
immediate concern encountered was for the effect of a rising sea
level on supply, whereas effects of climate change on drainage,
health and disposal of waste evoked little concern.''
   The so-called greenhouse effect is the overall average warming of
the earth because of the buildup of gases in the atmosphere that
trap radiant heat of the planet that normally would be radiated out
to space. Many scientists say it already has begun.
   One effect of the process would be the expansion of the oceans
and a rise in sea level simply from the warmer water.
   The water resources panel used widely accepted computer
predictions of an increase in average global temperature of three to
eight degrees Fahrenheit sometime in the next century.
   These computer models predict an increase in worldwide annual
average precipitation of 7 percent to 15 percent, but there is
little agreement among them on what could happen to particular
regions. The panel said regions could see average temperatures rise
by as much as 18 degrees or fall by more than five degrees.
   Regionally, precipitation could show anything from a 20 percent
decrease to a 20 percent increase, and runoff could rise 50 percent
or fall 50 percent. Evaporation from vegetation and other sources
could increase by 10 percent or fall by the same amount.
   Sea level increase could be between 4 inches and 3\ feet, the
scientists said.
   Among other recommendations, the panel called for measures to
encourage markets in water rights, emphasis on research on regional
effects within the next decades as opposed to shorter or longer
periods, and awareness of the opportunities for conserving water and
adding flexibility to water delivery systems.

<HEAD>Zayre Spins Off Wholesale Division, Merges With TJX; Ames Closing
77 Stores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zayre Corp. said Monday it is spinning
off its wholesale division and merging with its TJX Cos. subsidiary
in a major restructuring that will end the company's association
with the 59-year-old Zayre discount store chain name.
   Meanwhile, Ames Department Stores Inc., which bought 392 Zayre
stores from Zayre Corp. for $800 million in September, said it would
close 74 of the outlets.
   Zayre said it would pay a $3.50-a-share dividend to stockholders
after forming a separate company for its BJ's Wholesale Club and
HomeClub operations.
   After the spinoff of the new Wholesale Clubs company, Zayre
planned to merge with TJX Cos., a subsidiary of which Zayre owns 83
percent, the company said in a statement.
   TJX's minority shareholders will receive 1.35 shares of Zayre's
common stock for each share, the company said.
   Zayre said it would change its name to TJX Cos. next June, ending
its affiliation with the name that comes from the German and Yiddish
phrase ``zehr gut,'' meaning very good, chosen by brothers Max and
Morris Feldberg, who founded the company in 1929.
   Zayre President Maurice Segall, who led Zayre to retail success
after he was hired in 1978 but has struggled since 1986, said he
would step down after the restructuring is completed, probably in
the spring.
   After the wholesale spinoff, TJX will consist of Hit or Miss and
T.J. Maxx discount clothing chains, the Chadwick's of Boston
catalogue operations and Zayre Corp.'s remaining non-operating
assets and liabilities.
   Zayre spun TJX off in 1987 as a separate company from its apparel
chain.
   Zayre said that for the 12-month period ending Oct. 29 the TJX
companies had sales of $1.82 billion. BJ's Wholesale Club and
HomeClub reported sales of $1.54 billion for the same period.
   The restructuring and Ames buyout follow a two-year decline for
Zayre. While Hit or Miss and T.J. Maxx have flourished, Zayre
Discount reported losses of almost $70 million for the first two
quarters of this year.
   Ames said it would close 77 discount department stores, including
74 Zayre Stores in 14 states, after the holiday shopping season.
   Rosemary Keogh O'Neill, a spokeswoman for Ames, said the 77
stores employ 7,500 to 7,700 people, two-thirds of whom are
part-time. Employees will be offered transfers where possible, she
said.
   ``Closing unprofitable stores is essential to our main task, that
of returning the remaining 318 Zayre Stores to their historic level
of profitablity,'' said Peter B. Hollis, Ames' president and chief
executive officer.
   Also announced Monday was the appointment of Ames Executive Vice
President James T. McKitrick as chairman of Zayre Stores, replacing
Herbert Zarkin.
   The states in which stores are to be closed are located in
Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky,
Louisiana, New York, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Minister Endorses Eggs, Supports Subordinate in Salmonella Scare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke on Monday urged
shoppers to ``carry on buying eggs'' despite 46 recent outbreaks of
salmonella.
   Through October, there have been 46 outbreaks of salmonella,
affecting 1,000 people in England and Wales, traced to eggs,
according to Clarke.
   ``We accept there is a health hazard which we are all tackling,''
Clarke said during an appearance at the House of Commons. ``The
average member of the public is not at risk at all.''
   However, Clarke also defended statements by Edwina Currie, a
junior minister who said most of the nation's egg production was
affected by salmonella.
   ``She was right to stress the concern we feel about eggs and draw
attention to the advice we have issued,'' Clarke said.
   The Ministry of Agriculture announced that producers had agreed
to a voluntary code which included buying chickens only from
licensed hatcheries, inspecting flocks regularly for salmonella,
discarding cracked eggs and keeping eggs refrigerated throughout the
distribution chain.
   Food poisoning from all sources affects 1.5 million persons a
year, the health ministry said.
   Egg producers were still furious over Mrs. Currie's statement in
a television interview on Saturday, and John Coles, chairman of the
British Egg Information Service, said the group was considering a
lawsuit against her.
   ``We have got an industry with a retail value of something like
1.5 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) and if we lose 25-30 percent of
that market the losses will be astronomical,'' Coles said.
   However, the British Broadcasting Corp. said on its midday
television news that major grocery chains reported only slight dips
in egg sales.
   Clarke's chief medical adviser, Sir Donald Acheson, told the BBC
that pregnant women, infants, the elderly and the sick should only
eat eggs which had been cooked until solid.
   For healthy adults, however, ``I think it is an acceptable risk _
it's a very small one _ or us to continue to enjoy our boiled egg
with a runny inside,'' Acheson said.
   The British eat 30 million eggs a day produced by 39 million
laying hens on 5,000 commercial farms.
   Eggs were taken off the menu on Monday for 1,000 patients at
Queens Medical Center in Nottingham, and they will stay off until
the local health authority decides otherwise, said Rosalind Channon,
the hospital's assistant manager Rosalind Channon.
   Nonetheless, an egg-swallowing contest was held as scheduled
Monday in Gloucester. The winner, John Thornton, 25, swallowed 36
hard-boiled eggs in 15 minutes at the Golden Hart pub.

<HEAD>Buyers Flock To Sale At Country Home of Henry Ford II</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Antique dealers and collectors crowded into a
marquee beside an English country mansion on Monday and paid $2
million for paintings, furniture, rugs, silver and ornaments owned
by the late Henry Ford II.
   The antiques had furnished Turville Grange near Henley, 35 miles
west of London, which was the country retreat of the American
automaker and philanthropist on his visits to Britain.
   The house, in the Queen Anne style of the 18th century, was not
being sold. It was used by the British royal family earlier in this
century and was owned by Prince Radziwill and his wife Lee, sister
of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, before Ford bought it in the 1970s.
   The sale total was double the estimate by Sotheby's, which sold
the house contents on instructions from his executors. Henry Ford II
died in September 1987. He was the grandson of Henry Ford, the
Detroit motor company's founder.
   ``The sale attracted a lot of commercial buyers, but also people
interested in Ford's life and the house. It was a cross-section of
buyers, many of them private collectors,'' said Beth McHattie, a
Sotheby's publicist.
   There were gasps when a simple silver cigarette box, made in
Birmingham in 1947 and expected to fetch about $1,500, sold for
$41,140.
   The interior was inset with a panel enclosing grass from the
first sod cut in 1929 by Edsel Ford, the founder's son, on the site
of the Ford car plant at Dagenham in east London. The box was
presented to Henry Ford II when he visited Dagenham in 1948.
   ``The bidding was very competitive because of the box's
connotations,'' said Ms. McHattie.
   There were more gasps when a Victorian brass and leather
upholstered fire fender, estimated at $1,870, was sold for $19,500
to a London dealer.
   Early American furniture that Ford bought from New York dealer
Israel Sack was expected to return across the Atlantic.
   The best piece was a 1740 walnut chest of drawers from
Philadelphia, which made $21,600, while an 18th century maple
armchair from Rhode Island went for $15,900.
   Carpets fetched the top prices. A Bessarabian carpet went for
$154,275 and a Ziegler carpet for nearly $60,000, both to anonymous
buyers.
   Sotheby's said to its knowledge there was no one from the Ford
family at the sale.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commercial banking industry easily
could become obsolete without serious legislative reform, the
president of the American Bankers Association warned Monday.
   ``The future isn't all that bright,'' said Thomas P. Rideout,
also vice chairman of the First Union National Bank of North
Carolina in Charlotte, at the Oregon Bankers Association's annual
winter conference.
   From 1977 to 1987, he said, banking's share of financial assets
held by financial institutions dropped from 37 percent to 29 percent.
   In the same period, large banks' share of credit extended to
nonfinancial corporations fell from 62 percent to 44 percent, he
said. Credit-market debt held by banks for the same period also
dropped, from 41 percent to 35 percent.
   Deposit growth among competitors during the period far outpaced
the 117 percent growth experienced by commercial banks, with savings
and loan deposits up 139 percent, life insurance reserves up 191
percent, liabilities and capital of securities brokers and dealers
up 1,042 percent, and money market mutual funds up 6,450 percent,
Rideout said.
   Technology has permitted easy entry into the financial services
business by institutions outside the traditional banking industry,
he said, and their services are expanding.
   ``Competitors are being allowed to engage in banking without
meeting the supervisory standards imposed on banks, or our same
strict capital requirements, which in fact are getting stricter as
we head toward 1992,'' Rideout said. ``Lax standards, of course, are
one of the main causes behind the FSLIC (Federal Savings & Loan
Insurance Corp.) crisis today.''
   Bank failures have risen, he said, from 42 in 1982 to 184 in 1987
and 175 through October of this year. The number of institutions
identified as ``problem banks'' has risen from 300 in 1982 to 1,575
in 1987 and 1,495 through May of this year.
   Rideout said association members should target legislators to
push for reforming antiquated banking laws _ particularly those
covering deposit insurance.

<HEAD>Legislators Introduce Bills Backing Proposition 103</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several state lawmakers introduced
bills Monday to shore up the voter-approved measure to cut insurance
rates that has been temporarily stayed by the state Supreme Court.
   Senate Insurance Committee Chairman Alan Robbins unveiled a
measure which he said would prevent insurers in the state from
profiting as a result of any attempts to evade Proposition 103. The
bill, SB103, threatens hefty financial fines for pullbacks from the
market.
   ``If what's happened with these companies (withdrawing from the
California market) is allowed to snowball, and if more companies
then stop writing policies, that is something we cannot do and
something we're not going to do,'' Robbins said.
   ``In other states, penalties have not stopped companies from
leaving a market, but they have discouraged new companies from
coming in and picking up the business that's left behind,'' said
Edward Levy, representing the Association of California Insurance
Companies.
   Senate Leader David Roberti, a Los Angeles Democrat, said he was
introducing a bill that would create an office in the state Justice
Department to represent consumers with insurance problems during
legal or administrative proceedings.
   And Sen. Cecil Green, a Norwalk Democrat, said he will introduce
a measure that would give the consumer advocate's office the power
to investigate and intervene on behalf of consumers when insurance
companies are engaging in unfair methods of competition or deceptive
practices.
   Lawmakers said the rush to introduce bills, or sign on as
co-authors of other legislators' measures, stems from their
eagerness to implement the California electorate's will, expressed
with the recent passage of Proposition 103.
   ``I think the vote of the people passing Proposition 103, despite
tens of millions of dollars being spent by the insurance industry to
defeat it, has placed a focus of public attention on the issue,''
Robbins said.
   But the Legislature may face an uphill battle as it attempts to
pass significant insurance-related legislation, something it has
been unable to do in recent years.
   Even if lawmakers are able to steer bills between the powerful
lobbies of two perennial foes, insurers and trial lawyers, and gain
two-thirds votes, the measures will still have to go to Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian, who opposed Proposition 103.
   After voters approved rate-cutting Proposition 103, several
insurers announced they were limiting or ending their auto insurance
business in California.
   The state Supreme Court then stayed the initiative while
considering its constitutionality and most of the companies said
they would suspend plans while awaiting the outcome.
   Insurers are challenging several provisions of the measure,
including those that would roll back most rates to 20 percent below
November 1987 levels and a requirement that would force companies to
renew all policies unless the risk to the policyholder increases.

   Newsroom employees at the Chicago Sun-Times voted
overwhelmingly Monday night to approve a new 3-year labor contract
at the city's second-largest newspaper, a union leader said.
   The vote among reporters, photographers and other editorial
staffers was 132-26, said reporter Tom Gibbons, chairman of the
Chicago Newspaper Guild's Sun-Times unit.
   Earlier Monday, the guild's executive director said ratification
of the contract would be a step toward better relations between the
workers and management.
   ``During the course of negotiations, both sides said they would
like to have peace,'' Jerry Minkkinen said. ``If the membership
ratifies, we will try to make sure that happens.''
   The settlement, worked out last Friday moments after a strike was
set to begin, includes a $500 payment on Jan. 1 and raises of 3
percent in each of the following two years.
   The pay scale at the newspaper currently ranges from $625 a week
for starting reporters to $895 for reporters with five-years'
experience.
   Union and management initially agreed to a contract on Nov. 22,
but snags developed over pension formulas and the 250 guild members
sent their bargainers back to the table.
   The negotiators emerged with a second tentative contract shortly
after a noon strike deadline Friday. The agreement was nearly
identical to the first pact, but pension benefits were increased by
6 percent and other minor changes were made.
   The night city editor's slot will be exempt from union coverage
and the $500 payment will be made Jan. 1, instead of July 1.
   Newsroom employees have been working without a contract since
June 1.
   The Sun-Times has an estimated circulation of 605,000 daily and
614,000 on Sunday. Its competitor, Chicago Tribune, has an estimated
circulation of 765,000 daily and 1.11 million on Sunday.

<HEAD>First Maryland Agrees to Sell Rest of Stock to Allied Irish Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of First Maryland Bancorp
has agreed to sell the remainder of its stock to Allied Irish Banks
PLC after the foreign bank increased its offer, First Maryland said
Monday.
   First Maryland is the parent of First National Bank of Maryland.
   Allied Irish, which already owns 49.7 percent of the Maryland
bank, will acquire the remaining 50.3 percent of its stock. A
special committee of First Maryland's board decided on Saturday that
an offer of $39.25 a share, or about $371 million, is ``fair and in
the best interests of the stockholders,'' the bank said in a
statement.
   In October, the special committee had rejected Allied Irish's
first offer of $35.25 a share, or $340 million.
   ``We are pleased the agreement has been reached on the terms of
the proposed acquisition,'' said Allied Irish Chairman Niall Crowley.
   Under the merger agreement, Allied Irish will start a cash tender
offer for the stock during the next five days. When the tender offer
is completed, any outstanding shares not owned by Allied Irish will
be converted into the right to receive $39.25 a share.
   At least 75 percent of the shares, including those already owned
by Allied Irish, must be tendered, or no shares may be purchased.
The offer will remain open at least 20 business days after it starts.
   Allied Irish first bought 43 percent of the shares of First
Maryland in 1983 and has since increased its ownership to nearly
half the outstanding shares. Under an agreement that expired last
year, Allied Irish's purchases had been limited to 60 percent.
   First Maryland, with assets of $6.4 billion, earned $41.1
million, or $2.30 a share, in the first nine months of this year.

<HEAD>Key IBM Manager Goes to Xerox, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key executive of International Business
Machines Corp. has resigned to head product planning, development
and manufacturing at rival Xerox Corp., according to a published
report.
   The New York Times, in Tuesday's editions, said William C. Lowe,
47, had served as a lightning rod for criticism of IBM's personal
computer marketing strategy.
   Lowe, who resigned Monday as president of IBM's Entry Systems
Division, was the architect of the computer giant's 1981 entry into
the personal computer market, the Times said.
   In recent years, IBM's personal computer line has been battered
by competition from clone machines, the paper noted.
   IBM announced Monday that James A. Cannavino, a vice president,
has been named president of the Entry Systems Division to replace
Lowe. Cannavino will report to Richard T. Gerstner, a vice president
and the general manager of IBM's Personal Systems division.
   Cannavino had been president of the company's Data Systems
Division.
   In addition, a new Advanced Workstations Division will be headed
by Vice President Nicholas M. Donofrio, who also will report to
Gerstner.
