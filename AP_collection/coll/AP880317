<HEAD>North Gave Ransom Courier Presidential Authorization For Carrying
Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An employee of Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot
carried a letter from White House aide Oliver L. North giving him
presidential authority for transporting $100,000 to Canada as part
of a plan to free a U.S. hostage in Lebanon, according to a
published report.
   North sent the courier, Jay Coburn, to Canada in January 1986
with a letter on National Security Council stationery that said
Coburn ``is acting on official U.S. Government business on behalf
of the President of the United States,'' according to a copy of the
letter obtained by The Washington Post.
   ``In support of this mission he has the authority to transport
and disburse as necessary, U.S. $100,000,'' the letter said. ``In
the event of emergency or clarification, please contact: Oliver L.
North.''
   Perot had provided the money, at North's request, to help free
Peter C. Kilburn, the librarian at the American University in
Beirut who was kidnapped Dec. 3, 1984. Kilburn was killed by a
Libyan terrorist group in April 1986 in apparent retaliation for
the U.S. bombing of Libya.
   Coburn needed the North letter in case U.S. Customs Service
agents stopped him at the border, the Post said in Friday's
editions. Travelers must file a disclosure statement if they take
more than $10,000 out of the country. Failure to file is punishable
by up to $250,000 in fines and five years in prison.
   The Post said Coburn has told associates that he filed no
disclosure statement and planned to rely on North's letter if he
ran into trouble at the border.
   Coburn got into Canada without difficulty and in Montreal, he
gave the money to a Canadian citizen who had provided proof of
contact with Kilburn's captors. The Canadian said the $100,000 was
a down payment and that with it, he could arrange Kilburn's release
for $1 million more, said the Post, which did not identify the man.
   The Canadian contact took the money, but never came through with
his end of the deal and was later observed by the CIA in Damascus,
spending the money on high living, the Post said, citing
unidentified sources for the information.
   The Post said that a senior FBI official has told Congress that
then-FBI Director William H. Webster _ who is now CIA director _
approved the FBI's participation in the plan. The newspaper said
the plan also was discussed with Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   North has said repeatedly that he had express authority from his
superiors for his actions.
   However, the White House has said Reagan had no knowledge of any
efforts to ransom U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   North, who was fired from his job as an NSC aide in late 1986
following revelations of the secret sales of arms to Iran and the
diversion of profits from those sales to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels, was indicted Wednesday.
   He was charged with conspiracy to defraud the government and
commit criminal offenses against it, theft of government property
and wire fraud arising from the diversion of arms-sales proceeds.
He was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction of
Congress, making false statements, obstructing Meese's Nov. 21-23,
1986 inquiry by making false statements and concealing, falsifying
and destroying classified government documents in NSC files.
   Also indicted Wednesday were former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert
Hakim.

   Three men in red academic robes and mortarboards
walked across the platform at Boston University to receive their
master's degrees, and later walked back into prison.
   Steven Kelleher, Robert Layne and Gene Perry, inmates at the
medium-security Bay State Correctional Center in Norfolk, became
the first master's recipients under a 16-year-old prison education
program.
   ``You begin to see your relationship with society and what you
owe to it,'' said Kelleher, 36, in the seventh year of a 12- to
20-year sentence for armed robbery. ``It puts everything in a
different light.''
   Layne, 41, serving two consecutive terms for possession of a
firearm and receiving stolen property, said higher education leads
to more responsible action in society.
   ``Life is decision making,'' said Layne. ``Bad decisions put you
in jail. The more complex and complicated the decision, the more
education is needed to make the right choice.''
   ``It was tough to study after being away for all those years,''
said Perry, 41, who has served eight years for second-degree
murder. ``But after I got the hunger to learn, it was something
that just took over.''
   All three, bestowed Master of Liberal Arts degrees Wednesday,
got their undergraduate degrees in prison and each expressed a
desire to perform counseling or social work once free.
   The three graduates join about 60 other degree recipients in the
program, which has served more than 500 inmates at the medium
security state prison at Norfolk prison and the adjacent minimum
security correctional center with classes from high school
equivalency to postgraduate.
   ``This is the true model for education for all,'' said Elizabeth
``Ma'' Barker, a BU professor emeritus and founder of the school's
Prison Program. ``This is truly education befitting all free men.''
   BU pays for textbooks and teacher salaries and the state
subsidizes tutition for the inmates. In 1985, the non-profit
Massachusetts Council on Prison Education was formed representing
11 higher education institutions offering classes to inmates,
including BU and Curry College in Milton.
   BU President John Silber told the nearly 100 friends, family and
educators at Wednesday's ceremony that some consider the program an
unnecessary frill.
   ``These are individuals who society deemed not worthy of being
free,'' said Silber. ``Through education, they become useful
citizens catering to the society they depend on. They are earning
their right to be free.''

<TEXT>
   Dust was in the air as West Texans coped
with the annual onslaught of earth, wind and fiery sandstorms.
   The season usually begins in mid-March and ends in May. April is
the windiest month, and the driven dust can sand-blast car
finishes, damage skin and hair and make life miserable for allergy
sufferers and people with respiratory illnesses.
   El Paso suffered through its first dust storm of the year a week
ago, once again meeting a timetable as old as the desert and Texas'
South Plains.
   The season's high winds and dry weather, combined with
plowed-under fields, make Lubbock particularly dusty this time of
year, said Andy Anderson, meteorologist in charge at the National
Weather Service there.
   ``Everything unfortunately seems to work in harmony,'' he said.
   Conditions are similar in the desert of the Trans-Pecos, where
moisture is scarce and the dust easily swirls in the warm winds.
   It's so windy in the Panhandle that Amarillo High School's
mascot is the sandstorm. The school's sports teams are known as the
Amarillo High Sandies.
   Wind picks up in spring because of uneven heating of the Earth,
causing fronts and upper-level disturbances, said Howard Wheless of
the weather service office here.
   ``We're going from winter to summer,'' Wheless said. ``It's just
a cycle that Mother Nature goes through.''
   It's also a cycle that allergy sufferers have to go through. At
the El Paso Allergy and Asthma Center, business picks up about 15
percent to 20 percent during dust storm season, said spokesman Jon
Kersey.
   ``We're seeing a lot of people come in,'' he said. ``They
complain of allergic rhinitis, asthma, wheezing, tightness in the
chest.''
   Allergic rhinitis is another way of saying hay fever.
   The wind-blown dust pits windshields and scratches car finishes,
but the body-repair business doesn't increase much during dust
storm season, said Enrique Medina, president of Spraymaster Paint &
Body in El Paso.
   Imogene Johns, manager of Aladdin Beauty College in El Paso,
said she, like most people, procrastinates when it comes to
protecting her hair and skin this time of year.
   ``Knowing better, I'll wait 'till it's too late,'' she said.
   She said people should use skin moisturizers and hair
conditioners ``to keep those ends from being whipped up in the
sand.''
   ``Once it hits, taking care of it later is kind of like running
out after the horse is out and shutting the barn door,'' she said.

   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd on
Wednesday called President Reagan's plan to send 3,200 U.S. troops
to Honduras an ``overreaction'' to the movement of Nicaraguan
forces into that country.
   Other legislators were more cautious in their reaction to the
White House announcement that U.S. troops were being dispatched for
what presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater termed a ``measured
response designed to show our staunch support to the democratic
government of Honduras.''
   ``I just hope it's merited,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said,
recalling a similar incident two years ago when the United States
leaped to the aid of Honduras under circumstances many saw as
exaggerated by the White House. ``I hope this is not an
overreaction.''
   A Contra supporter, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he would
``reserve judgment'' on the wisdom of Reagan's decision but that
U.S. combat involvement did not appear to be warranted.
   ``I think that it's clear that the Honduran government sought a
show of support from the United States,'' McCain said. ``I believe
these troops are not and must not be put into combat and to some
degree it will shift the focus from what the Sandinistras are doing
to what our troops will be doing down there.''
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., appeared supportive
of the decision and said it was intended ``psychologically to give
an indication that we are not just going to stand by and have
Nicaragua ... make incursions into neighboring countries.''
   But Byrd, D-W.VA., said the administration was going too far.
   ``It's an overreaction,'' he said. ``The Sandinistas have
crossed over the border before and gone back.''
   Jason Isaacson, a spokesman for Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
said the senator saw the administratoin action as an effort ``to
divert attention from the Iran-Contra indictments and to turn up
the heat on Congress for more aid to the Contras.''
   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, said, ``I don't think the president
really had an alternative'' to sending the troops to Nicaragua.
   ``The purpose is for them to demonstrate our commitment to
regional peace and stability,'' Fields said. ``I lay the blame for
the president having no alternative at the feet of (House Speaker)
Jim Wright and the Democrats who scuttled the Contra aid package.
   Earlier Wednesday before the troop action was announced, Wright,
D-Texas, said Nicaragua already was ordering its troops back from
the incursion into Honduras and that plans for resumption of
cease-fire talks with the Contra rebels next week remain on track.
   Wright said if those developments in fact occur, the seriousness
of the cross-border fighting will be greatly minimized and will
have little impact on the political climate in Congress toward
further aid for the rebels.
   But he said the reverse is also true, that aid prospects could
improve if Sandinista troops do not withdraw.
   Wright said word of the order for Sandinista troops to pull back
had been relayed to him by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel
D'Escoto, who also said President Daniel Ortega was asking the
United Nations to send an observer group to the border area.
   At the same time, others in Congress were skeptical about
administration portrayal of the incursion as ``a genuine national
security problem for the United States,'' as Secretary of State
George Shultz described it.
   ``They have cried wolf so many times ... even supporters of
Contra aid are somewhat skeptical,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., an aid opponent. ``It is apparently a major raid on a Contra
camp in the jungles. Now, that does not pose a threat to Honduras
or its capital.''
   ``I think you have to ask the question of whether 1,200
Nicaraguans going across the Honduran border is a threat to U.S.
national security,'' said Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.
   ``In this situation there is questionable trust in the
activities of the White House and the State Department,'' Coelho
said.
   Wright said he still does not believe support exists in Congress
for any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, and repeated
that congressional Democrats remain willing to talk about a further
package of purely ``humanitarian'' aid.
   But he did question the judgment of Ortega in mounting the
military action on the border. ``I would have preferred certainly
that no armed forces of any country enter into the territory of
another country,'' Wright said.
   Meanwhile, partisan warfare broke out on the House floor after
Democrats accused Republicans of abandoning the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels, and a GOP lawmaker's microphone was cut off during an angry
response.
   In a floor speech, Coelho triggered a verbal brawl when he said
the rebels had supported a Democratic aid package which was
narrowly defeated on March 3, but were ordered by the White House
not to lobby in favor of it.
   Republicans overwhelmingly voted against the $30 million
``humanitarian'' aid bill.
   ``We now know the truth,'' Coelho said. ``The Republicans
abandoned the Contras to the politics of cynicism ....''
   Coelho's remarks drew shouts of ``Shame! Shame!'' from the
Republican side of the chamber, and Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif.,
rose a few minutes later to condemn Coelho and Wright.
   ``In 10 years, Jim and Tony, ... I have never heard on this
floor so obnoxious a statement as I heard from Mr. Coelho,'' Dornan
said. ``Thanks to the radical and liberal leadership in this House,
the communists are winning a major victory.''
   Dornan referred to the White House assertion that Nicaraguan
troops had crossed the border into Honduras seeking to destroy
Contra supply centers and to deal a death blow to the rebels.
   Under House rules, members are allowed to speak for up to one
minute on any subject before the chamber begins its business each
day. Dornan's heated remarks continued past the two-minute mark,
and Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., presiding in the speaker's chair,
sought to gavel him down.
   Dornan, shouting and pounding on the podium, continued to speak,
however, to cheers and applause from Republican colleagues.
Apparently at Ackerman's request, Dornan's microphone was cut off
so that there was no longer any sound on the House television
system.
   That brought renewed outrage from the GOP side, which already
has a long-simmering feud with the Democratic leadership over what
they consider heavy-handed tactics used to control proceedings in
the chamber.
   Rep. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., objected that Ackerman was not acting
in accord with House rules and was attempting to ``close down the
process of free speech.''
   Ackerman responded that Dornan had ``greatly exceeded the limit
and abused the privilege'' of one-minute speeches, and that he
simply was trying to maintain House decorum and order.

   A 75-year-old woman finally found relief after 36
years of hiccuping, according to a report published today. Her
hiccuping stopped after doctors gave her a drug to treat her newly
diagnosed Parkinson's disease.
   Until then, ``the patient's hiccup bouts were almost continuous,
with rare remissions lasting a maximum of six to eight weeks,'' the
doctors wrote. ``Even during the periods of remission, sporadic
hiccups were observed. She had been hospitalized several times and
had undergone a great many tests.''
   The hiccups immediately stopped when she got the drug amantadine
for Parkinson's disease. The doctors theorize that the disease was
somehow responsible for the hiccups.
   The treatment was reported by Dr. J.J.M. Askenasy of Tel Aviv
University and colleagues from Hasharon Hospital in a letter in the
New England Journal of Medicine.
   In a separate letter, Drs. Izidore S. Lossos and Raphael Breuer
of Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem described another odd case of
hiccuping, this one involving a 19-year-old woman.
   She complained of a two-hour bout of hiccups along with an
unpleasant itching sensation in her left ear. The doctors found
that both problems were caused by an ant that had crawled into her
ear.

<HEAD>Gangster Convicted in Murder of Journalist</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with convictions in Taiwan, final
arguments from trial. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gangster was convicted Wednesday
of murdering a Chinese-American journalist on orders from the
Taiwanese government.
   A jury deliberated 45 minutes before returning the first-degree
murder verdict against Tung Kuei-sen, a member of the international
United Bamboo Gang, in the 1984 slaying of Henry Liu. Liu was shot
to death in his garage.
   Tung, 36, claimed he shot Liu for patriotic reasons, believing
he was killing a traitor.
   Liu had written articles critical of the Taiwanese government.
The 52-year-old journalist also had written about the personal life
of the late Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek, behavior
considered indecent in Taiwan.
   Tung, who is serving a 20-year sentence for heroin trafficking,
could receive 25 years to life in prison in the Liu slaying. He
also faces up to two years in prison for use of a firearm.
Sentencing was set for May 11.
   Tung had insisted on a trial because prosecutors refused to
offer a plea bargain and because he wanted to tell his story, said
defense attorney Douglas Gray.
   Earlier Wednesday, Tung testified the plot to kill Liu went as
high as the son of then-president Chiang Ching-kuo. The son at the
time was head of Taiwan's secret police. The president died in
January.
   Tung is the only one of Liu's suspected killers to be brought to
trial in the United States.
   Wang Hsi-ling, a Taiwanese vice admiral, was convicted earlier
in Taiwan of orchestrating the plot; two aides also were convicted
in the slaying, as were two other Bamboo Gang members. All five
received life sentences.
   The Taiwanese government had refused to extradite the gangsters
to the United States for trial. Tung was arrested in Rio de Janeiro
a year after the slaying.
   Wang wanted Liu killed before Liu was about to publish the
memoirs of a former high-ranking Taiwanese official, something Wang
feared would be embarrassing and damaging to President Chiang,
Assistant District Attorney Bob Bishop said.
   The suspected gunmen in the case had fled the United States and
surfaced in Taiwan, believing they were immune from prosecution,
Bishop said.
   The slaying strained relations between the United States and
Taiwan, and the United States began putting so much pressure on
Chiang's regime that ``something had to be done,'' Bishop told the
jury.
   In his testimony, Tung said he believed he was duped by his own
government into killing a man who was not a traitor. Liu asked in a
written statement sent to the judge Wednesday that a written
apology be given to Helen Liu, the victim's wife.
   Tung confessed to his role in Liu's killing two years ago during
his drug smuggling trial in New York. He was found guilty of
smuggling 660 pounds of heroin into the United States.

<HEAD>Doctors Caution Against Routine Use of Treatment of Juvenile
Diabetes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite promising preliminary results, physicians
should not routinely use a transplant drug to treat childhood
diabetes until experts learn its long-term safety and
effectiveness, doctors cautioned today.
   A report by French doctors is the latest in a series of studies
demonstrating that the drug cyclosporine seems to help victims of
juvenile diabetes, also known as Type 1 or insulin-dependent
diabetes.
   The report showed that half of the youngsters treated with the
drug did not need insulin shots one year after their therapy began.
   The study was conducted by Dr. P.F. Bougneres and colleagues at
St. Vincent de Paul Hospital in Paris and published in today's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   An accompanying editorial noted that cyclosporine can harm the
kidneys and ``is not an ideal drug.''
   ``We believe that it is still premature to advocate the use of
cyclosporine for patients who are not enrolled in clinical trials
in which the response to treatment and adverse effects are
carefully monitored,'' wrote Drs. Kevan C. Herold and Arthur H.
Rubenstein of the University of Chicago.
   Cyclosporine suppresses the body's immune system. It is widely
used after transplants to prevent rejection of the new organ.
   Although cyclosporine has been the subject of studies by several
research groups in recent years, experts still do not know the
long-term effects and hazards of the drug when used to treat
juvenile diabetes.
   The National Center for Health Statistics estimates that about 7
percent of all Americans are diabetic. The disease is the
underlying cause of 36,000 deaths each year.
   Usually the disease strikes during adulthood and can be
controlled without insulin shots. Only about one in 10 diabetics
has the juvenile-onset form of the disease, which usually destroys
the body's ability to make insulin. People with the juvenile form
face an increased risk of such complications as blindness, heart
disease and kidney failure.
   In the French study, 40 youngsters with recently diagnosed
diabetes were treated with cyclosporine. The researchers found that
two-thirds were in remission after four months, and half after 12
months.
   Those helped by the drug started getting treatment an average of
three weeks after diagnosis. Those for whom it failed started
therapy seven weeks after diagnosis.

   A prosecutor in the racketeering trial of Rep.
Mario Biaggi told the judge that another congressman was bribed and
that Wedtech Corp. founder John Mariotta ``was the prime mover'' in
the alleged bribery, it was disclosed Wednesday.
   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., the second congressman, has not been
charged with any crime. His attorney, Robert Morvillo, said
Wednesday that the congressman was aware that his activities were
being investigated and had denied any wrongdoing.
   Mariotta is a co-defendant in the trial of Biaggi, a Bronx
Democrat, involving alleged bribery of public officials by Wedtech,
a defunct defense contractor.
   In another development, a key government witness testified that
Biaggi sought 5 percent of Wedtech's stock and a 5 percent cut of
all government contracts that he and his law partner helped the
company get.
   The witness, former Wedtech Vice Chairman Mario Moreno,
testified that in the summer of 1982 he and Mariotta met with
Biaggi at a restaurant and the congressman ``indicated he wanted 5
percent of every contract that he could help bring into the
company.''
   Biaggi also wanted 5 percent of Wedtech's soon-to-be issued
stock, Moreno said.
   He testified that Mariotta later agreed to the deal but his
partner, Fred Neuberger, opposed it and got into a ``heated
argument'' with Biaggi at a later meeting in July 1982.
   ``We have done a lot for this company,'' Moreno quoted Biaggi as
telling Neuberger. ``This company is where it is because of the
services we provided to you.''
   The prosecutor's statement about Mariotta was revealed in the
transcript of a Tuesday morning conference in U.S. District Judge
Constance Baker Motley's robing room before the start of the day's
court session.
   ``As to Congressman Garcia,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary
Shannon told the judge, ``it is the government's contention that
Mr. Mariotta was the prime mover in the bribery of Congressman
Garcia.''
   In the conference, Mariotta lawyer Jeffrey Glekel complained
bitterly that prosecutors planned to elicit testimony about
Wedtech-related crimes from a key government witness who is not
charged in the case on trial.
   The witness, Mario Moreno, is one of four former Wedtech
executives who have admitted bribing public officials and agreed to
testify in a plea bargain with state and federal prosecutors.
   The integrity and reliability of the four former executives were
attacked by several defense lawyers in opening statements to the
jury Monday.
   Countering Glekel's arguments in the robing room session, Ms.
Shannon told the judge: ``We told Mr. Glekel that while we would
elicit from Mario Moreno that he had knowledge of and participated
in the bribery of Congressman Garcia, we wouldn't go beyond that;
nor would we bring out any details.''
   The judge asked: ``Now you plan to bring out details, is that
what you are saying?''
   ``To the extent that Mr. Mariotta was involved, yes,'' said Ms.
Shannon. ``Just to bring out his involvement. Again, not to
substantively prove that particular crime.''
   Prosecutors said they were entitled to bring out the other
alleged crimes because of the opening statements by defense lawyers.
   The transcript and court proceedings did not indicate whether
the judge would allow the testimony.
   Moreno, a former vice chairman of Wedtech, continued his
testimony Wednesday, elaborating on how another defendant, former
Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon, got his brother-in-law a
four-day-a-week job with the company.
   Moreno said Simon told him his brother-in-law, Henry Bittman,
``needed to take off one day a week ... he had to sign in at a
state job, a no-show job.''
   Previously, Moreno said company officials agreed to Simon's
request because they needed his help in getting city approval for a
land deal.

   ``Hello dear. You're very handsome. Yes you are,''
Sir Alec Guinness coos through the cage at a rhinoceros.
   ``You've got a sweet face, very pretty ears,'' the elder
statesman of British acting says, as he strolls through Berlin's
central Zoologischen Garten.
   His chat with the animals is almost as engaging as the wonderful
characters he has portrayed on stage and screen during five decades
as one of the world's finest, most chameleon-like talents.
   On this particular day, the Berlin Film Festival was awarding
the 73-year-old Guinness its special ``Ehren Bear'' (honorary bear)
for lifetime achievement in the cinema. The actor, however, elected
to avoid the morning crush of screenings and news conferences for a
romp in the zoo.
   ``I'm not actually that keen on them; I hate to see certain
animals caged up,'' he said.
   ``But I remember this zoo being small and very imaginatively
laid out on the open plan, and I thought it might be amusing to
have a second look.'' He last visited the Zoologischen Garten 14
years ago.
   Images of some of the zoo's reported stock of 10,000 animals
have lingered: ``They used to have white rhinoceroses there that
were charming. And a great sea lion covered in shrapnel wounds _ an
old thing that was like a symbol of Berlin; a splendid, great
creature.''
   This time around, Guinness' observations are as keen as ever,
whether applied to the varieties of zoo-bound species or the
special tributes that have marked his career.
   In 1980, he received a special Academy Award to honor a range of
work encompassing such portrayals as the sinister Fagin in ``Oliver
Twist'' (1948), a comic octet of murder victims in ``Kind Hearts
and Coronets'' (1950), the hard-driving Colonel Nicholson in ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957), the aging mystic Ben Obi-Wan
Kenobi in ``Star Wars'' (1977) and its sequels.
   Last year, he was twice feted in lavish galas _ in April at New
York's Lincoln Center and in May at the Cannes Film Festival.
   The occasion in Berlin may be less tony, but its significance is
no less clear: in the Festival's 38 years, Guinness is only the
second actor to be so honored, following James Stewart in 1982.
   ``I'm afraid when you get rather elderly, these things seem to
come on you rather more than you might wish,'' he says, his brisk
gait belying his years, his nose becoming slightly red in the
seasonal chill.
   A signpost draws his attention: ``I think that way may be the
pheasantry. Do you mind if we go in there?''
   Somewhere between pheasants and finches, the conversation turns
to work. His latest project is ``Little Dorrit,'' the six-hour film
adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel in which he plays William
Dorrit, a long-term inmate of a debtor's prison who finds that
sudden wealth brings sudden freedom.
   Guinness had not performed Dickens since the 1940s, when he both
adapted ``Great Expectations'' for the stage and made his movie
debut as Herbert Pocket in David Lean's 1946 film version. He then
appeared in ``Oliver Twist'' in 1948. He considers ``Little
Dorrit'' to be one of Dickens' two or three greatest novels.
   ``Dickens offers great temptations for actors because you can go
over the top,'' he said.
   Later this year, he'll be seen as Mr. Todd in a movie of Evelyn
Waugh's 1934 novel, ``A Handful of Dust.'' Then there's Lee
Blessing's current Broadway play, ``A Walk in the Woods,'' which
Guinness may do on the London stage. He last trod the West End
boards in Alan Bennett's ``The Old Country'' in 1977-8.
   ``It's a very distinguished piece of writing,'' he says of the
play. But Guinness acknowledges its pitfalls, as well: ``The amount
of learning for a two-hander is horrendous. An actor's great fear
is that he won't have the memory.''
   On that topic, he is emboldened by the recent return to the
stage, after a decade away, of his friend and mentor, Sir John
Gielgud, in the new play ``The Best of Friends.''
   ``Gielgud is 83,'' Guinness says matter-of-factly, ``and he got
through it (the play) very successfully.''
   By now, the sky has clouded over, and rain looks likely.
Guinness has a lunch date for which he mustn't be late, so he
returns to his hotel to find that autograph hunters have arrived.
   ``There they are,'' he says, sounding resigned as the anonymity
of the walk in the zoo gives way to the fans' ever-ready pens and
cameras.
   But before leaving the zoo, he has one last remark about rhinos:
``We're told they have very nice personalities.''
   He takes an inimitable pause. ``But I don't think I'd like to
encounter them intimately.''

   Three decades after the Irish
government evacuated his weeping father and the few other people
who remained on the tiny Blasket Islands, Mike Carney says the
exiles are flourishing in their landlocked new home.
   ``There's more of us here than in Ireland,'' said the happy
emigrant from the harsh life that ended abruptly in 1955 with the
closing of the islands off the western tip of the Dingle Peninsula.
   Carney, 67, is among the last surviving natives of the
five-mile-long main island that preserved 18th-century language and
customs into the middle of the 20th century, when the government
deemed the land too dangerous to inhabit.
   Now he makes his home among an estimated 50 other natives in
Springfield's Hungry Hill district.
   In Ireland, they ``lived in a pre-capitalist society in some of
the most treacherous waters of Western Europe,'' said Thomas Biuso,
an English professor at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, N.H.
   On Thursday, Carney plans to join other islanders for the city's
St. Patrick's Day parade and a drink at the John Boyle O'Reilly
Club, a far cry from the celebrations of his youth on the
westernmost point of Europe.
   ``Here there is more of a parade. It's more show-off here,'' he
said. ``Back there we would go pick a shamrock in the fields to
wear in green caps. If we could, we would go to the mainland to
watch the horse races.''
   Getting to the mainland three miles away in handmade canoes was
always precarious because of often-threatening weather, which
seemed to worsen by the mid-1900s, Carney said.
   Bad weather kept his family from bringing his brother's body to
the mainland for burial for three days after his death in the
winter of 1947. Neither a doctor nor a priest could be summoned
because of the storm.
   The islands apparently were too remote even for a bull brought
from the mainland for breeding. The bull swam the three miles home,
Carney said.
   The island's remoteness, however, ensured the preservation there
of an ancient social organization, which included a king and a
council of elders, and of the Gaelic tongue. Carney said
Gaelic-speaking mainlanders have difficulty understanding islanders
``because we speak so fast.''
   No one knows when the first mainlanders settled on the Blaskets
or when the islanders began emigrating to the United States, but
Biuso said they apparently left in the mid-1800s to work on the
railroad running through Massachusetts.
   Carney's father went to the United States three times but always
returned. ``I guess he got homesick,'' Carney said.
   Carney was 16 when he left for Dublin, where he worked as a
bartender for 10 years before coming to Springfield.
   ``I could not see myself battling the Atlantic Ocean for a
living,'' he said. ``You could be captive on the island for a month
without being able to go to the mainland to get food. It looks
beautiful, yes, but to operate there, that's a different story,
battling 20, 25 foot waves in those little boats.''
   By then the Blaskets' population, which had numbered 176 people
at its peak, had fallen to a few dozen.
   ``We had more relatives in Springfield than we had back in the
Blaskets,'' Carney said.
   His brother, Paddy, said: ``We were like wild geese following
after each other. There was nothing left for us, but we were all
lonesome leaving. I don't think anyone really wanted to go.''
   The government, fearing for the safety of the island's aging
population, took the last islanders off in 1955 and gave them
houses on the mainland, some within sight of the island.
   ``My father cried when he left,'' Carney said.

but later released. Here is his account.

   ``Yes, we are also simulating arrests,''
said the captain as I nodded toward a somber-looking military man
being led away by soldiers at gunpoint.
   ``This is merely an exercise,'' the captain added.
   But it was no exercise.
   It was an attempted coup by a group of young officers, led by
police chief Col. Leonidas Macias, who tried to take over the
Defense Forces headquarters Wednesday and overthrow Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the military chief.
   This reporter, accompanied by AP Radio reporter Pauline Jelinek
and AP photographer Diana Smith, had been forced out of our car at
gunpoint by soldiers in full battle gear when we tried to stop in
front of the Defense Froces headquarters.
   We drove there following reports that a group of officers had
tried to take over the installation. Soldiers had cordoned off the
street in front of headquarters.
   As we tried to park near a checkpoint, soldiers noticed the
photographer's cameras and started banging on the doors of the car.
They stuck their guns through the windows and yelled, ``Get out!''
   They took cameras, tape recorders and car keys. I identified
myself as a newsman and was asked: ``Which country?'' We told him,
the United States. The government and the Panamanian news media it
controls daily accuse American news media of distorting information.
   I insisted we should be allowed to leave, but was forced to lean
on the car for a search and then a sergeant said, ``Take them
inside.''
   We were forced to walk one long block at gunpoint by two
soldiers who kept urging us not to look back and ``just keep on
walking,'' past a big patio where an infantry company was listening
to a speech by an officer, and into the large yard between
headquarters and the barracks of the elite Urraca infantry unit.
   ``Anything going on?'' I asked our escort.
   ``Just shut up and keep walking. There is nothing going on. Move
and don't look back,'' he replied.
   We saw armed civilians and military moving around. Then a
captain came in and told our escort, ``Just calm down.'' He turned
to us and explained, ``This is just a routine exercise.''
   ``You mean you simulate reaction in case of an attempted coup?''
I asked
   ``That's right,'' the captain said.
   It was then we saw about four civilians and military men lead an
officer, his shirt hanging out, head bowed and hands behind his
head into the barracks.
   ``Yes, we are also simulating arrests,'' the captain added.
   ``They were taping and taking pictures,'' our escort said to the
captain.
   ``Take the tape and the film,'' the captain said.
   ``The exercise is over. You can go. You can pick up your gear
tomorrow,'' the captain told us.
   After I insisted we need the equipment right away, he agreed to
let us have it back.
   Later on, a soldier brought our car. On the way out, I saw
several other civilians standing, while other armed civilians
removed pistols from their belts.
   For an exercise, it was very realistic.

<HEAD>Two Swarms of Africanized Bees Found In New Orleans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two swarms of so-called killer bees were
discovered on the waterfront earlier this month in a leaking
shipment of honey from Guatemala but were apparently trapped and
destroyed, authorities said Wednesday.
   ``We have begun a two-week trapping program at the wharf to
ensure none escaped, however,'' said state Agriculture Commissioner
Bob Odom.
   Africanized, or killer, bees are more aggressive than the
domestic honey bee. Since they take over other hives, they are
considered a threat to the U.S. honey industry.
   The bees were taken from Africa to South America where they
escaped in the 1950s. They have been advancing northward since
then, but their movement is believed to have been stopped near
Tehuantepec, south of Mexico City.
   Odom said Customs officials spotted them buzzing around two
containers.
   ``The swarms were destroyed. The queens were found,'' said Tom
Rinderer, director of the Lousiana State University laboratory that
is the federal government's main research center on Africanized
bees.
   ``That's an important discovery. This is a complete destruction.
No question about it,'' he said.
   Rinderer said most of the bees were workers, which are not
involved in reproduction. ``If one or two of them got loose, it
doesn't mean a thing,'' he said.
   The shipment on which the bees were found originated in El
Salvador, said state entomologist John Impson.
   Odom said that killer bees have been found in Florida and
California, but officials believe the swarms were contained.

   Residents of Lt. Col. Oliver North's
hometown are steadfast in their belief that he's a hero, even after
he was indicted on charges of conspiracy in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``We still believe in Ollie,'' Mayor Philip Mossman said
Wednesday night. ``If I took a poll right now I'd find that most
people here are in favor of Ollie. He's a folk hero around here.''
   ``I think he's taking the fall for higher-ups,'' added the
mayor's son Nick, the lone judge in this village of 1,600
residents. ``What I gather is that most people believe in him and I
think they'll support him to the end.''
   In rural Philmont, located about 30 miles south of Albany,
negative words about North are seldom heard. Hometown supporters
remember North, voted ``most handsome'' and ``most courteous'' by
his senior class in high school, as a go-getter.
   ``I remember him as a conscientious student, industrious and not
political,'' Thomas Givens, one of North's high school teachers and
a former neighbor, said of the fired National Security Council aide.
   Another teacher echoed the sentiment. ``North was a real swell
young kid, and now he's getting raked over the coals,'' said Robert
Bowes.
   ``The majority of the people down here are behind him,'' said
Russ Robertson, North's high school track coach. ``I think he was
just acting under orders. He was trying to do the best for his
country. It looks like Larry is the fall guy.''
   Residents know North as Larry, his middle name, to distinguish
him from his late father, Oliver Clay North, an Army colonel who
earned a Silver Star for valor in World War II.
   The younger North graduated in 1961 in a class of fewer than 50,
then left Philmont to attend the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis,
Md. His mother, Ann, lives in Guilderland, a suburb of Albany. His
two younger brothers and a sister also have moved away from
Philmont.

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua mobilized its troops and
appealed to citizens to help the army Wednesday after the United
States announced it was sending soldiers to Honduras for a training
exercise, the official radio said.
   The government did not confirm reports from Honduras and
Washington that Sandinista troops pursued U.S.-backed Contra rebels
into Honduran territory during an offensive in northern Nicaragua.
   However, President Daniel Ortega said fighting was raging along
the border and that there was ``cross fire from Honduran territory
against our forces.''
   ``This is the hour in which the Nicaraguan people must place
themselves at the orders of the Sandinista army,'' the government
radio network said late Wednesday.
   It said troops were being mobilized throughout the country, and
demonstrators took to the street in the southern town of Rivas,
near the Costa Rican border, to protest the dispatching of U.S.
troops to Honduras.
   The radio called Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo's request
for U.S. military help ``just a disguise, since these troops could
well come into Nicaragua. This is certainly the intention, and they
will do it at any moment.''
   ``But they will not catch the Nicaraguan people sleeping,'' the
radio network said.
   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States was sending 3,200 soldiers to southern Honduras to
carry out training exercises and to be ``a signal to the
governments and the people of Central America.'' He said they would
not enter any combat zones.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras of Honduras said
Wednesday night that Azcona contacted Ortega to demand the
withdrawal of the Sandinista troops. Honduran military intelligence
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated
Press that Honduran troops had surrounded about 2,000 Nicaraguan
soldiers near the border.
   In Costa Rica, President Oscar Arias said his government had
confirmed the incursion. He condemned it.
   The leftist Nicaraguan government took control of all privately
owned radio stations Wednesday and hooked them up into a national
network that broadcast government announcements and revolutionary
music.
   Ortega told a news conference Wednesday afternoon that the
offensive was launched March 6 and that Sandinista troops recently
disloged about 2,000 rebels from northern Jinotega province. He did
not say how many Sandinista troops took part in that action.
   Ortega said the Contras were receiving logistical support and
evacuation from Chinook helicopters owned by the United States.
   Referring to reports earlier Wednesday that the Reagan
administration was considering sending military support to
Honduras, Ortega said: ``This is the most serious threat in recent
years. We are calling on the Nicaraguan public to be alert, to be
in combat readiness, ready to repel, resist, defeat whatever
aggression from the United States.''
   State-run Voice of Nicaragua radio said earlier there were
reports from the Atlantic coastal city of Puerto Cabezas, 250 miles
east of Managua, that unidentified airplanes were seen and that
residents feared the city would be bombed.
   It called on Nicaraguans to ``maintain a state of alert ...
because we can't discount the possibility that President Reagan
will invade Nicaragua in defense of his mercenaries.''
   A Defense Ministry spokeswoman, Maj. Rosa Pasos, told reporters
earlier: ``We have never invaded Honduras and we have never invaded
any neighboring country.''
   Lopez Contreras said the Honduran president telephoned the
presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala to ask them to
urge Ortega to withdraw his troops from the border.
   Speaking of the offensive against the Contras, Ortega said:
``They have been totally expelled from Nicaraguan territory and are
located in Honduran territory, opening fire against our positions
in Nicaragua.''
   The leftist president said that 400 Contras had been killed or
wounded in the operation. Thirty-four Sandinista soldiers had died
and 68 were wounded, he said.
   Ortega charged that the United States was ``creating this
scandal'' to delay talks between the Sandinistas and Contras on a
cease-fire in the 6{-year-old war. The meeting _ which would be the
first on Nicaraguan territory _ is scheduled next Monday.
   The president said he called on the United Nations and the
Organization of American States to investigate the offensive and to
prove that the Contra bases were located in Honduras.
   Honduras and other Central Americans are prohibited from
offering financial or logistical help to rebels under a regional
peace plan signed August 7.
   In March 1986, 1,500 Sandinista troops reportedly penetrated
Honduran territory. U.S. helicopters ferried Honduran troops to the
border and provided Honduras $20 million in emergency aid.
   Ortega never directly admitted the incursion but said at the
time: ``We attack where they say they have their bases.''
   Until last year, the Contras maintained support bases in
Honduras. Fueled by $100 million in U.S. aid, most of the more than
6,000 rebels moved their camps into Nicaraguan territory.
   In December 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery pounded
Sandinista troops who had penetrated into Honduras to attack Contra
bases, and U.S. Army helicopters again were brought in to ferry
Honduran infantrymen to the front.

<HEAD>A Week After Southern Wins, Gore Still Searching For Northern
Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week and a half after his breakthrough in the
South, Democrat Albert Gore Jr. is in need of another one: in a
state where a win will sustain his claim to be a real contender.
But Gore's campaign still is trying to find that state.
   He never expected it would be Illinois, although Gore's
presidential campaign poured an estimated $200,000 to $300,000 into
late television ads there in hopes of a surprisingly strong showing.
   And it's not likely to be the next big state, either. Michigan's
Democratic caucuses March 26 will determine a big chunk of
delegates _ 138. But the process here requires organization _ a
commodity Gore's campaign is short on.
   ``I think he's got to win some states, but I'm not saying which
one right now,'' said Larry Harrington, Gore's deputy campaign
manager and political director.
   Gore rocketed to the top tier of Democratic presidential
contenders on Super Tuesday by doing what he said he would do:
carry a good chunk of the South.
   He claimed five Southern states. Gore took a split decision in
Wyoming three days days earlier, which he points to as a win that,
with his victory in Nevada's caucuses, proves drawing power outside
the South.
   But no one will ride to the nomination on the strength of those
two small Western states. While Gore contends he has already
established himself as the moderate with national appeal, the rest
of the Democratic Party is awaiting proof in the series of Northern
and Midwestern states that stretch from now until the California
primary June 7.
   Still serving as a principal strategist for his own campaign,
Gore is studying the primary calender.
   The Gore campaign plans to set up some organization in virtually
all the remaining primary states, supporting his claim to be more
than a regional candidate.
   They don't want to single out any state as holding the best
potential for Gore, to avoid being drawn into a make-or-break
contest.
   Yet Gore must establish a Northern beachhead somewhere if he is
to continue to argue that he is the most electable candidate and
only real alternative to Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis. And
more importantly, if he is to keep up in delegates.
   He must single out some state or states to focus his budget for
television commercials.
   ``That's the real decision,'' said Harrington.
   A state to punch through, Gore called it.
   ``We've got a whole series of contests between now and June 7,''
Gore said, talking aboard his campaign plane this week. ``We're
going to compete in all of them, and in some we're going to punch
through.
   ``We're pushing everywhere ... and looking for the best
opportunity to make an all-out push to break through, and I think
there are a lot of opportunities,'' Gore said.
   A look at the primary calender reveals no easy choice, however.
None of the upcoming states offers the comfort of a natural base.
   He named nearly all the big ones as posing opportunity:
Connecticut, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Wisconsin,
California and New Jersey.
   He called Connecticut ``an opportunity to demonstrate real
strength,'' but at the same time a Dukakis ``backyard.''
   The campaign also considers New York as having potential, and
Wisconsin is another candidate.
   As it wrestles with the decision, Gore's campaign is
experiencing the growing pains associated with the new demands of a
national effort.
   It is struggling to add depth. This week it hired departed
candidate Bruce Babbitt's issues director, Bart Gellman, to help
craft policy positions. It has also put Harrington and press aide
Mike Kopp with the candidate to beef up Gore's traveling staff.
   Gore also says fund-raising has been spurred by Super Tuesday,
and he took in as much as $150,000 a day immediately after that
showing.
   Even so, the campaign is hardly a match for the well-heeled
Dukakis organization. Gore's schedule is being made up practically
on the fly.
   Gore sought endorsements from Democratic figures in Southern
states, and he has turned to state legislators in states like
Michigan and Connecticut.
   But Harrington called Michigan a particularly tough state for
Gore because of the need for an organization that can deliver in
the caucuses. Gore had virtually no organization there before this
week, and even now it is based primarily on the state House speaker
and other legislative leaders.
   Fewer than half a dozen supporters turned out for Gore's arrival
in Detroit Monday night, and his campaign advance man had only been
in the state a few hours before the candidate arrived.
   ``We're not going to blow the doors off there,'' Harrington said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. veterans are cheating the government out
of tens of millions of dollars each year by lying about their
incomes and collecting excessive benefits as a result, a
congressional report says.
   The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
wing of Congress, compared Veterans Administration income forms
filled out by pensioners with Internal Revenue Service data.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, released the report Wednesday
and said Congress should move to halt the abuses by giving the VA
access to same tax information so it can verify what veterans tell
it about income from jobs and investments. Murkowski is the senior
Republican on the Veterans Affairs Committee.
   The IRS information is compiled from reports supplied by
employers and other income sources such as banks and stockbrokers.
   The GAO's findings were based on an examination of such
information from a single year. It said pensioners who understated
their incomes to the VA potentially collected $182.5 million more
in pension payments than they deserved in 1984.
   Under the law, the size of a VA pension _ which went to 1.4
million people in 1984 _ is determined principally by a recipient's
total income from all sources.
   The GAO report said congressional investigators found that
549,000 pensioners failed to tell the VA about $947 million in
income.
   The report said that more than 26,000 veterans told the VA they
had no earned income in 1984 but each actually made at least $1,000
through employment.
   ``Some cases had reported no earnings over several years,
although tax data showed significant earnings in those years,'' GAO
said.
   Some 60 percent of the pensioners who understated their incomes
to the VA failed to report that they received money through
interest and dividends, according to GAO.
   The report said it could not estimate the exact amount of
pension overpayments by the VA, but it estimated that potential
overpayments of $182.5 million went to 149,000 pensioners whose VA
and IRS records had a difference of $100 or more.
   Murkowski said the figures may be low because GAO made several
conservative decisions in compiling its data, including ignoring
all unreported income below $100.
   Murkowski and GAO urged the VA to overhaul its income
verification system and said Congress should give the agency the
legal ability to use IRS data to cross-check the income veterans
report to the VA.
   This is the type of system that has been used for several years
to verify the income of applicants for and recipients of need-based
entitlement programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.
   Murkowski said that ``if VA was allowed the same access to tax
records _ as the GAO had and as food stamps, Medicaid and other
means-tested programs do _ VA pension payments would be focused on
the intended beneficiaries and more money would be available for
other veterans' programs and services.''
   The senator said he would introduce legislation to give the VA
the ability to use IRS records to verify what it is told by its
pensioners.
   ``Clearly, VA should be allowed to go to where the most accurate
information can be found,'' he said.
   ``The intent of this legislation is not to `get' anyone,'' he
said. ``Rather, it is to protect the integrity of this vital
benefit and to ensure the money ... goes to its intended
beneficiaries.''
   GAO quoted the VA as saying it agreed with the report's findings
that it needs the tools to verify pensioners' income and that its
income questionnaires could be improved.
   But it quoted the IRS as saying it opposes giving the VA access
to tax data because ``such access would compromise the voluntary
tax system.''

   With no chance of winning the Republican
presidential nomination, his campaign curtailed, and his former
free spending shackled, Pat Robertson is trying to map out his role
at the party's national convention _ and beyond.
   The former television evangelist confidently says the party will
listen to his conservative message, but other political analysts
believe Robertson has squandered his strength with a string of poor
primary showings.
   All agree that his real effect on the party is likely to come in
1990 and 1992.
   Robertson believes his active presence at the New Orleans
convention will ensure that the likely nominee, Vice President
George Bush, will heed the conservative position on the issues.
   ``I want to ask George Bush questions... Is he going to be as
fervent for the Contras... as Ronald Reagan? Will he be truthfully
as fervent for tax cuts as Ronald Reagan?'' Robertson said Tuesday
after finishing third in the Illinois primary behind Bush and
Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
   Robertson is claiming his forces will make themselves felt in
the convention platform and rules committees. He said he would like
to see the 1984 platform resurrected _ ``It was a good,
conservative platform.''
   That platform endorsed constitutional amendments to ban abortion
and to allow prayer in school, and opposed the Equal Rights
Amendment and any tax increases.
   Robertson has spent nearly $25 million on a campaign that has
won 17 delegates. The federal spending cap for the primaries is $27
million. Some longtime Robertson watchers question the amount of
clout that gives him.
   ``He has no chance to win the nomination. He never did. His
candidacy is irrelevant in terms of the nomination,'' said Larry
Sabato, a professor of political science at the University of
Virginia and longtime observer of state and national politics.
   Though Robertson may have some effect on the party's platform
and procedural votes in the convention, ``he lost a great deal of
clout because of his pitiful performance in the South,'' Sabato
said.
   Robertson won none of the 14 Southern and border states holding
primaries or caucuses on the March 8 Super Tuesday. He placed third
in his home state of Virginia and was third in his hometown of
Virginia Beach.
   Richard Pinsky, the national field director for Americans For
Robertson, said even though the candidate will not be contesting
any of the primary states and will be taking his scaled-back
campaign only to states holding caucuses, he expects Robertson to
come to the convention with 150 to 200 delegates.
   ``He has a substantial bloc of votes behind him,'' said William
Whitehurst, a professor of history at Old Dominion University and
former Virginia 2nd District representative for 19 years. ``What it
boils down to is what does he want in the way of price to keep him
in the party fold?''
   Robertson met with Republican National Committee Chairman Frank
Fahrenkopf on Tuesday to discuss what the candidate called
``housekeeping details'' surrounding the convention. Robertson
would not say whether he asked the party for a chance to address
the convention during prime time.
   ``Hopefully we could be in that kind of time slot,'' said Connie
Snapp, Robertson's director of communications, ``but that was not
discussed.''
   It's difficult to predict what Robertson might get, said
Whitehurst. ``His showing has been sufficiently weak that he can't
make too many demands,'' he said. Whitehurst said he does not see
Robertson being offered a Cabinet post or a place on the ticket.
   ``He needs to wait for friendlier times,'' Whitehurst said.
``And acquire the political maturity he desperately needs.''
   Sabato and Merle Black, political scientist from the University
of North Carolina and another commentator on Southern politics, see
Robertson's long-term effect on the party coming at the state and
local level.
   In many caucus states, Robertson's people, the majority of them
political newcomers, have taken control of the party at the
precinct level.
   ``Although Robertson's viability as a candidate seems to be
dissipating, I think we'll see the impact of his candidacy through
these delegates, partly at the convention, partly in local and
state politics as well. This may be played out over years,'' said
Black.
   ``These new people are part of the party and are not fighting
the party. We are sending a signal at the convention that we are
sticking with the party,'' Snapp said. ``And that the party is
going to need us.''

   As Terry Anderson's fourth year in captivity
began, his friends and loved ones gathered to pray for the
longest-held American hostage's release from Lebanon.
   ``Pray ...that Terry Anderson will come back from hell,'' said
Charles Glass at a ceremony to honor the American newsman, who has
been kept blindfolded and chained to a wall during his captivity.
Glass, also a journalist, escaped from captivity last year.
   More than 300 people attended the ceremony for Anderson. Among
them: Jesse Jackson, the Democratic presidential candidate; Peggy
Say, Anderson's sister; and the Revs. Lawrence Martin Jenco and
Benjamin Weir, former hostages.
   Other ceremonies for Anderson were held in Batavia, N.Y., where
Mrs. Say lives, and Lorain, Ohio, Anderson's birthplace.
   By coincidence, the third anniversary of Anderson's captivity
came as former White House aides Oliver L. North and John
Poindexter were indicted for their role in selling weapons to Iran
and sending the profits to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Jenco and Weir are two of the three Americans hostages released
as a result of the weapons shipments to Iran. Both have said they
would have opposed selling arms to the radical government of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Anderson, 40, and at least some of the other eight American
hostages are thought to be held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say said that since the Iran-Contra affair was revealed _
in November 1986 _ the Reagan administration, embarrassed by the
episode, has ignored the hostages. ``For the past year, silence,''
she said.
   Jackson blasted the administration for taking a passive role and
pursuing what he called a flawed policy in the Middle East. ``We
must be willing to make it happen,'' he said.
   Jackson said he would go to Lebanon to talk with Anderson's
captors, if they would identify themselves.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., said in a statement that he has
proposed a special envoy to deal with the hostages.
   ``I will not accept the explanation that nothing can be done,''
he said. ``Something must be done.''
   The service at Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church included
Christian and Moslem prayers, songs, a candle-lighting ceremony and
personal reminiscences about Anderson. Children in the audience
distributed olive leaves as a symbol of peace.
   Many in the group were colleagues of Anderson's in Beirut where
he served as the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press.
   The ceremony was arranged by The Journalists Committee to Free
Terry Anderson, a group dedicated to seeing him released, and No
Greater Love, a humanitarian organization that helps families of
hostages and victims of terrorism.
   Don Mell, an AP photographer, recounted how Anderson ``had the
look of a man who knew he was doomed'' when he was kidnapped after
a game of tennis in West Beirut three years ago. ``The whole thing
took less than a minute,'' said Mell, who witnessed the abduction.
   The State Department, meantime, reaffirmed administration policy
toward the hostages.
   ``We have made constant efforts to open a valid channel of
communications to the terrorists,'' department spokeswoman Sondra
McCarty said. ``They have responded with unacceptable demands
conveyed through one-way channels such as videotapes given to news
agencies.''
   The United States is willing to talk, but it will not make
concessions, she said.

<TEXT>
   A 19th century Irish farmer longs for more of
the world than his family's farm but is reined in by his mother's
apron strings in ``The Great Hunger,'' presented by Dublin's Abbey
Theater, the national theater of Ireland.
   Based on a poem of the same title by Patrick Kavanagh, the play
by Tom MacIntyre develops as a series of episodes rather than
narrative. Some of Wednesday's second-night audience in the Triplex
at Manhattan Community College, apparently not enjoying theater of
indirection, left at intermission.
   One is reminded of a Beckett play. Actor Tom Hickey has the
more-than-scruffy clothes, aged, unshaven look and anguished
expressions of a Beckett protagonist. There's also a lot of noises,
nonsense syllables and silence. But there's more speech _ and a lot
more lively moving around _ than is usual in Beckett.
   The farmer, Paddy Maguire, lacks education and money and the
ability to escape from his small world. In one articulate passage
between Paddy and his sister toward the end of the play, they
exchange phrases: ``The young men and women. I might have joined
them. I remember a night we walked through the moon the four of us.
Seeking adventure.''
   The mother is represented on stage by a primitive wood carving,
seated, her lap a chair. There are seven in the cast, who sometimes
are children, Paddy's pigs, chickens or team of horses.
   Audience members who were interested seemed to be concentrating
so hard they didn't relax to laugh. One very funny few moments came
when a girl selling raffle tickets for the Catholic church joined
Paddy in a superior cluck-and-strut rooster-hen mating dance in his
barnyard.
   Much of the time Paddy sits on his gate or compensates for his
lack of female companionship. This may have sent some of the
audience home.
   Director Patrick Mason joined the company in 1977 and has
directed five Tom MacIntyre works. The current engagement, through
March 27, ends a tour of the Soviet Union and the United States.
   The last time the Abbey Theater was in New York was in 1976,
when it presented ``The Plough and the Stars'' at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music. Its last Manhattan appearance was on Broadway in
1937, with ``Juno and the Paycock'' and ``The Playboy of the
Western World.''

<HEAD>Lobbying and `Medigap' Fraud Against Elderly Denounced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shady organizations with official-sounding
names are using fear over the future of Social Security to get the
elderly to send them money, according to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
who denounced the practice as a ``sham.''
   The solicitations are little more than efforts to raise money
for the organizations, which prey on the fears of the aged, McCain
told a Federal Trade Commission hearing on Wednesday.
   He called on the agency to investigate several organizations
which, he said, Consumer Reports magazine has identified as using
fraudulent fund-raising techniques.
   ``What all these mailings have in common is official-sounding
names and letterhead implying a special connection with Social
Security which simply does not exist,'' McCain said. ``In addition,
their messages imply that Social Security is in trouble _ which ...
is simply not the case.''
   While there are worthwhile organizations for the elderly, McCain
said, many of those sending out such solicitations do nothing more
than raise funds for their own coffers and send postcards to
congressional offices.
   ``Pure and simple ... this is a sham,'' McCain said, ``and its
victims are those who can least afford to take money needed for
their basic day-to-day needs and send it to such organizations.''
   ``Fraud against the elderly is a problem of increasing magnitude
_ one that deserves our active attention,'' McCain said at a
special FTC hearing on the problems of the aged.
   ``The number of people in the United States over the age of 65
now exceeds the entire population of Canada, and Americans 65 and
older make the fastest growing population segment in this
country,'' observed FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver in opening the
session.
   The Census Bureau estimated that there were about 29 million
Americans aged 65 and over as of 1986, while Canada was estimated
to have a total population of about 26 million.
   The FTC, which investigates fraud and antitrust matters, called
in a series of witnesses to discuss the problems of the elderly,
and what can be done to help.
   Testimony also focused on the so-called Medigap insurance plans,
designed to supplement Medicare and Medicaid benefits for the
elderly.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., said sales fraud in that industry is
costing the elderly as much as $3 billion annually.
   Commissioner Terri Calvani noted that the FTC is looking into
sales practices in this industry, which consumer groups say induce
many elderly people to purchase duplicative and unneeded coverage.
   However, Calvani noted that the commission is specifically
prohibited from regulating the insurance industry, so that
regardless of what it finds in the investigation, any action would
have to come from Congress or from the states.
   Telephone marketing fraud and medical quackery also are major
problems for elderly Americans, the witnesses said.

<HEAD>FCC Drops Plan to Hike Charges For Phone Hook-Ups For Computer
Users</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission is
abandoning plans for a hefty increase in telephone hook-up charges
for computer users, according to FCC and congressional sources.
   Strong and nearly unanimous opposition to the proposal led FCC
Chairman Dennis R. Patrick to give up on it, said the sources, who
spoke on the condition they not be identified by name.
   Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said Wednesday that Patrick
had not spoken with her about scrapping the plan, but she said she
agrees.
   ``There's a lot on our plate right now and I don't think I'd
miss not seeing that on it,'' she said.
   Their votes would be enough to ditch the proposal, though the
third commissioner, James Quello, who could not be reached for
comment, was likely to concur.
   Patrick's office declined to comment.
   Dropping the plan would be good news for the hundreds of
thousands of computer users who dial into databases such as
CompuServe and QuantumLink. The services carry items such as news
stories and financial reports, and allow users to communicate
electronically with each other.
   Users of these services flooded the FCC and Capitol Hill with
thousands of letters opposing the plan, which would add about $4.50
an hour to the cost of hooking up to information services.
   They said the increased charges, which would double the hourly
hook-up price for some information services, would drive many of
them off the computer networks and crush a fledgling industry.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass. and chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce telecommunications subcommittee, said that in light of
the commission's apparent reversal on the proposal he would delay
indefinitely introduction of a bill preventing the FCC from
imposing the access charges.
   But, he said, the panel ``will closely monitor the commission's
actions to ensure that these onerous charges do not re-emerge in a
new form.''
   The FCC had proposed extending to computer users the same access
charges now paid by long-distance companies for access to the local
phone network. The long-distance companies pass these charges along
to callers in their rates.
   When it adopted the long-distance access charges in 1982, the
FCC exempted information service providers, fearing that the new
industry would not withstand the sudden increase in costs.
   In proposing to levy the charges last year, the FCC said the
issue was one of fairness.
   But the commission found virtually no support for the proposal.
Even the Reagan administration, which usually backs the FCC's
ideas, opposed the idea.
   The sources said Patrick concluded the proposal should be
dropped because of the lack of support and because the commission
is considering plans by the local Bell phone companies to give
information providers equal access to their networks, as they have
given long-distance companies. These plans could change the way
information services are provided over the local networks.
   The commission was expected to vote in two to three months to
drop the proposal.

   The ashes of Dorothy Parker, the writer, poet,
critic and Algonquin Round Table wit, are going to a final resting
place in Baltimore after languishing for years on a shelf in a
lawyer's office.
   As she suggested for her epitaph, ``Excuse my dust.''
   Mrs. Parker, whose fiction, poetry, criticism and ascerbic wit
epitomized the sophistication of New York City in the '20s and
'30s, was exiled to Baltimore at an irreverent meeting of fans
Wednesday at the Algonquin Hotel.
   Best known for her immortal squib, ``Men seldom make passes at
girls who wear glasses,'' she wrote in 1956 that ``Wit has truth in
it; wisecracking is simply calisthenics with words.''
   Success came early to Mrs. Parker, who was drama critic for
Vanity Fair magazine at age 24, and soon a regular at the
Algonquin, trading barbs with Robert Benchley, Alexander Woolcott,
George Kaufman, Ring Lardner and Heywood Broun.
   She died, bitter and alone in her hotel room in 1967 after a
life whose early successes could not overcome the later
disillusionment that included unhappy love affairs, three marriages
and four suicide attempts.
   She wrote:
   ``Razors pain you
   ``Rivers are damp
   ``Acids stain you
   ``And drugs cause cramp
   ``Guns aren't lawful
   ``Nooses give
   ``Gas smells awful
   ``You might as well live.''
   For 10 years, Mrs. Parker's ashes have been sitting in a
canister on a shelf in a Wall Street office. They wound up there
when playwright Lillian Hellman, executor of Mrs. Parker's estate,
refused to pay a mortuary bill and the mortuary threatened to throw
them out.
   They were rescued by Miss Hellman's attorney, Paul O'Dwyer, who
decided last summer that he'd like to get them out of his office.
   New York Daily News columnist Liz Smith said she wrote about the
situation and readers replied with ``perhaps the most literate, the
most charming and the most intelligent mail that's been written in
the past 50 years.''
   And that led to Wednesday's meeting at the Algonquin, which Mrs.
Parker helped make famous as the home of the Round Table, the
weekly gathering of New York's literati in the 1920s and '30s.
   Ms. Smith said that Mrs. Parker ``would have been quite
sarcastic about this whole thing and would have thought we were
terrible fools.''
   Some people, Ms. Smith among them, thought the ashes should be
interred at the Algonquin bar, where Mrs. Parker created many a
hangover. But the Algonquin's current management wasn't
enthusiastic about that idea.
   O'Dwyer dutifully offered the suggestion of one letter writer,
an artist who wanted to use Mrs. Parker's ashes to thicken his oil
paints, but that got little more than a few snickers.
   Book collector Bob Weinberg of Stamford, Conn., said he went to
the meeting hoping to take home the ashes to complete his
collection of Mrs. Parker's work. But he apparently thought better
of the idea and never proposed it.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, said Mrs. Parker had left
her entire estate to the NAACP, when that was ``quite a daring
thing'' for a white woman to do.
   He offered a place for the ashes at NAACP national headquarters
in Baltimore, conceding that some people might not want the NAACP
to have the ashes, ``not because we're not worthy, but because
we're not in New York.''
   Some people agreed, but others thought Mrs. Parker would
appreciate Hooks' gesture. When the Algonquin's manager sweetened
the deal by offering to hold a benefit dinner to create a Dorothy
Parker scholarship fund, that sealed it.
   Mrs. Parker might have appreciated the irony of a quintessential
New Yorker's banishment to Baltimore. As she wrote in the '20s:
   ``Why is it no one ever sent me yet
   ``One perfect limousine, do you suppose?
   ``Ah, no, it's always just my luck to get
   ``One perfect rose.''

<HEAD>House Asked To Spend $1.8 Billion For Clean-Coal Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Energy Department official has asked a
House appropriations subcommittee to authorize $1.8 billion in
advance for the final three years of a clean-coal technology
program.
   ``We have no desire to make any frivolous expenditures,''
Assistant Energy Secretary J. Allen Wampler told a House panel on
Wednesday. ``We monitor that real closely.''
   Wampler asked the subcommittee to authorize the expenditure in
the fiscal years 1990, 1991 and 1992. The money pays up to half the
cost of projects to show the ways clean-coal technology can be used
by power plants and industry.
   Seven projects were given $227 million in the first phase of the
program, and Wampler said four contracts still being negotiated
will bring the initial commitment to $400 million.
   In addition, he said, the Energy Department will award $575
million this year for second-phase projects, using money
appropriated for fiscal 1988 and 1989. ``The interest is out
there,'' Wampler said.
   President Reagan proposed a five-year, $5 billion clean-coal
program in an effort to curb acid rain, which occurs when sulfur
dioxide and other emissions from power plants and factory boilers
mix with moisture aloft and fall to the ground as rain.
   Acid rain is blamed for aquatic pollution and damage to crops
and forests in the Northeast and Canada.
   Although the White House requested $850 million for clean-coal
projects in fiscal 1988 and 1989, Congress approved only the $575
million. Wampler said the department is asking Congress to restore
money cut from the program in addition to authorizing the
appropriations for the three years.
   While Wampler was seeking more money for the future, a group
representing states and private participants in the program was
meeting in the nation's capital to learn how members could qualify
for the $575 million set-aside for second-phase projects.
   At its third annual conference, the Clean Coal Technology
Coalition also endorsed the Energy Department budget request.
   ``If the program is successful, the environment will benefit,
our national energy security will be strengthened, the use of U.S.
coal resources will be assured and consumers' electric or energy
bills will be kept to a minimum,'' said Ben Yamagata, its executive
director. ``The benefits are really enormous.''

   President Reagan's arms-for-hostages deals
became the springboard for an elaborate, illegal conspiracy to aid
the Nicaraguan Contras and enrich two private businessmen,
according to the indictment of four key Iran-Contra figures.
   It is this conspiracy that forms the backbone of the 23-count
indictment against former National Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter; his aide, Oliver L. North; and the two businessmen:
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and his business
partner, Albert Hakim.
   Arms sales to Iran were formally authorized by Reagan on Jan.
17, 1986 when he signed an official finding.
   But the indictment charged that the defendants ranged far beyond
the president's initiative into the zone of illegality.
   They did it by deceiving the Justice Department, Congress, and
even the Central Intelligence Agency, the indictment said. Official
documents were destroyed and transactions were concealed through
use of foreign corporations and untraceable Swiss bank accounts,
the grand jurors said.
   The aid to the Contras came while such assistance was banned by
Congress.
   The indictment accused the defendants of repeating the same
deceptive scheme to make a profit for what Secord and Hakim called
``The Enterprise'' _ and to arm and supply the Contras.
   For instance in early 1986, the indictment said, the defendants
told the CIA that Iran paid $3.7 million for 1,000 TOW anti-tank
missiles when the Iranians actually paid $10 million.
   The difference went for the Contras and to Swiss investment
accounts ``under the control of the defendants Secord and Hakim for
their personal benefit,'' the indictment said.
   In May 1986, the indictment went on, $16.4 million was deposited
for the Enterprise, including $15 million from Iran for Hawk
anti-aircraft missile parts, and TOWs for Israel. The TOWs for
Israel were to replenish that nation's supply for its prior
transfer of TOWs to Iran.
   The conspirators ``caused only $6.5 million to be transmitted to
the United States through the CIA ... thus leaving a remainder of
almost $10 million in the bank accounts of the Enterprise,'' the
indictment said. The arms sales profits again went for the Contras
and the Hakim-Secord profits.
   And in October and November 1986, the conspirators shipped 500
TOWs to Iran and were paid $3.6 million by the Iranians. Only
slightly more than $2 million went to the U.S. government through
the CIA, with the remaining $1.5 million going to the businessmen,
the indictment said.
   Part of the conspiracy involved North's fund-raising for the
Contras and the Secord-Hakim enterprise.
   ``In the spring and early summer of 1985, in order to fund the
Enterprise, the defendant Oliver L. North began raising money
through the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty by,
among other things, arranging meetings with officers of and
potential contributors to NEPL, and others participating in
soliciting contributions for ... the Contras,'' the indictment said.
   ``From the fall of 1985 to December 1986, the defendant Oliver
L. North controlled the disposition of funds raised for the Contras
through NEPL.''
   Last spring, two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz''
Channell and Richard Miller, pleaded guilty to felony charges that
they conspired with North to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation
for the purpose of raising money for the Contras, a non-exempt
purpose. Both are cooperating with Walsh's investigation.
   And in June 1986, the indictment said, North came up with a new
scheme. He attempted to divert to the Enterprise a $10 million
contribution from Brunei intended for humanitarian aid to the
Contras.
   He did so ``by undertaking to supply an official of the
Department of State (Elliott Abrams) with the bank account number
of Lake Resources (an enterprise account) instead of the number of
a Contra bank account, which the official had requested.''
   Another part of the conspiracy was to deceive Congress, the
indictment said. North and Poindexter made ``false, fictitious,
fraudulent and misleading statements and representations,
concerning, among other things, the involvement of officials of the
United States ... in support of the military and paramilitary
operations in Nicaragua.'' Such assistance was banned by the Boland
Amendment passed by Congress.
   And in November 1986, as a Justice Department inquiry of the
Contra effort closed in on North and Poindexter, they ``altered,
destroyed, removed official and other documents and records,
including classified documents and records of the NSC and the staff
of the NSC,'' the indictment said.
   It said North further tried to cover up his activities in late
November 1986 by making ``false and misleading statements to the
attorney general'' who was conducting an inquiry for the president.

   As a Protestant gunman opened fire and
hurled grenades at a Roman Catholic funeral, another Protestant was
receiving a medal from a different group of Catholics for his
fortitude in a different atrocity.
   While three people lay dying in the Milltown cemetery in Belfast
on Wednesday, Gordon Wilson of Northern Ireland was in Limerick in
the Irish Republic, being honored for his words of love and
forgiveness after losing his daughter in an IRA bombing that killed
11 Protestants.
   Thus, as often happens in the 19-year cycle of violence savaging
Northern Ireland, two dreadful deeds four months apart came
together in a mixture of horror and poignancy.
   After the Nov. 8 bombing in Enniskillen, some optimists hoped
56-year-old Wilson's courageous example would ignite a grass-roots
rebellion against violence of all political stripes.
   Cynics, however, talked of ``the politics of the last atrocity''
_ the notion that no single bloodbath can turn hearts and minds to
peace, because sooner or later the other side will try to square
the books with a similar atrocity.
   Wednesday's attack is a severe setback to Northern Ireland's
British rulers, who believed they were on the way to shoving the
Irish Republican Army out of the Catholic mainstream.
   That was the purpose of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which
gave the Irish government a say in the running of Northern Ireland
on the assumption that Catholics would come to see Dublin, rather
than the IRA, as their protector.
   The funeral bloodbath is bound to help the IRA, which is
fighting to drive the British from Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland and recoup the loss of face it suffered over the
Enniskillen bombing.
   Wednesday's atrocity also showed just how thin a tightrope
Northern Ireland can be.
   The three people being buried were IRA guerrillas shot and
killed in Gibraltar March 6 as they allegedly prepared to plant a
car bomb, and the fact that they died unarmed had already scored
propaganda points for the IRA against Britain.
   Had the Belfast police turned out in force as they usually do at
IRA funerals, the unmasked gunman might never have mounted such a
blatant attack.
   But the police, reluctant to get into a fight with the mourners
that might hand the IRA yet more sympathy, stayed well away, and
none was around to disarm the attacker.
   Meanwhile, Gibraltar put the Irish government in a vice as well.
   On the one hand, Dublin was condemning the British for slaying
unarmed Irish people. But, then, it too regards the IRA as a mortal
enemy.
   So, while wringing its hands over the deaths, Dublin made sure
the guerrillas' cortege was shunted out of Irish territory with
minimal fanfare, and a state radio journalist was suspended for
airing interviews with leaders of Sinn Fein, the legal political
wing of the outlawed IRA, as the hearses drove north to Belfast.
   Ireland feels it has enough problems of unemployment,
emigration, crime and high taxes without having to deal with a
crisis it regards as being of Britain's making.
   The funeral shootings came on the eve of St. Patrick's Day, when
Dublin was preparing an extra big parade to commemorate its
millennium. The deaths had no visible impact on the shoppers
cramming central Dublin.
   But trouble was clearly brewing from the moment the Gibraltar
coffins crossed the border into Northern Ireland.
   Ulster Protestants have grown increasingly frustrated at their
failure to topple the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which they see as an
intolerable intrusion in affairs by a hostile Catholic state.
   Dublin's protests about the Gibraltar killings were, to
Protestants, an outrageous abuse of its rights of intervention
under the Anglo-Irish accord, considering that a car bombing was
allgedly being planned.
   As soon as the cortege entered Northern Ireland on Monday night
it was jeered and stoned by Protestants. Thus the prospect of a
Protestant gunman opening fire on the funeral was not as
far-fetched as might be imagined.
   The incidents come at a troubled time for Anglo-Irish relations
after the honeymoon engendered by the 1985 pact.
   A series of rancorous incidents have occurred over British
behavior in Ulster-related matters, in which the Gibraltar
shootings were only the latest irritant.
   However, at least one man remained optimistic. Gordon Wilson
told his audience in Limerick:
   ``I believe in the fundamental decency of all Irish people and
the longing for peace in all Irish hearts. I have no doubt about
that.''

<HEAD>Democrats Question Honduras Move; Dole Backers Point To
Iran-Contra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contenders are expressing concern about
President Reagan's decision to send U.S. troops to Honduras today,
with Jesse Jackson calling it ``heavy-handed,'' while indictments
in the Iran-Contra affair are putting some political heat on George
Bush.
   Bob Dole's backers were quick to suggest that if Bush is the
Republican nominee, the Democrats will use the re-ignited
Iran-Contra affair as ammunition against him this fall.
   The Democrats didn't wait that long, however, with Richard
Gephardt calling the indictments evidence that the Reagan
administration has put the Constitution ``through the shredder.''
   Dole's beleaguered GOP campaign, meanwhile, came in for some
serious scrutiny on Wednesday, with Republican Party Chairman Frank
Fahrenkopf hinting that the Kansas senator should think about
throwing in the towel after his latest loss to Bush, in Illinois.
   But Dole, whose aides said he would stay in the race at least
until the Wisconsin primary on April 5, got some encouragement from
a dozen Senate supporters who met to talk about his prospects.
   ``I believe he should stay in,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley of
Iowa, one of the group. Grassley said the four indictments on
Wednesday in connection with the Iran-Contra affair were not
directly discussed but said: ``There's going to be some Reagan
baggage that George Bush has to contend with, and realistically
it's going to be problems for the Republicans this fall.''
   Former National Security Adviser John Poindexter, Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North, retired Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and Secord's
business partner Albert Hakim were indicted on conspiracy charges
stemming from the diversion of secret Iran arms sale profits to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   ``What is going on with those four gentlemen has nothing to do
with this campaign,'' said Bush spokesman Pete Teeley.
   But Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., said, ``George can't duck
the issue. He's going to have to explain his role.''
   Fahrenkopf's remarks, however, seemed aimed at suggesting that
the Senate minority leader should abandon his bid. While stressing
his neutrality in the GOP campaign, the party chief said he had a
responsibility to ask Bush's rivals ``for some reflection.''
   Dole and former television evangelist Pat Robertson, he said,
should ``start thinking past the convention and start thinking
about November'' and the general election. Robertson has indicated
he will drastically scale back his campaign but remain in the race.
   Meanwhile, the Democrats, who have been eyeing each other warily
amid prospects of a deadlocked race, turned their fire on the
Reagan administration over both the Iran-Contra indictments and the
sending of four military battalions to Honduras in response to a
reported Nicaraguan incursion there.
   ``Sending in our troops is a bit heavy-handed,'' said Jackson.
``It's just not necessary.''
   Sen. Paul Simon also expressed concern, saying ``there is
skepticism on the part of all of us about anything'' the
administration does in Central America.
   Simon also hit the administration over the Iran-Contra affair,
saying the indictments underscore ``something fundamental'' _ that
the administration cannot be trusted to obey the law.
   ``We need a government we can trust,'' he said.
   That view was echoed by Democratic rival Gephardt.
   ``Whatever the outcome of these prosecutions, I think the
special prosecutor has given us fresh evidence that the Reagan
administration generally has put the Constitution of the United
States through the shredder,'' Gephardt said.
   Gephardt and Simon both campaigned Wednesday in Michigan, which
holds its Democratic caucuses March 26. Gephardt, running dead last
in Democratic delegate totals, desperately needs a strong showing
in the state.
   ``They say I'm the underdog,'' he said at a stop in Lansing. ``I
like being the underdog because the underdog usually does well.''
   The Missouri congressman will soon have to decide whether to
continue his presidential campaign or file for re-election to his
House seat. The filing deadline is March 29, three days after the
Michigan contest.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., still seeking a strong showing
outside the South, was campaigning today in Kansas, which holds
local party caucuses on Saturday. Gore was addressing the Kansas
House.
   Simon, who revived his campaign with a home-state victory in
Illinois on Tuesday, continued to predict that no one will be able
to patch together enough delegates for a first-ballot victory at
the national convention. He said he doubted he'd win in Michigan,
but added: ``I'd like to pick up as many delegates as I can.''
   Dukakis again expressed hopes that the Democratic contest
wouldn't come down to a fight at the convention. ``I think there is
agreement on the part of most Democrats across the country that
somebody will come out of this primary process with, if not an
absolute majority, a substantial plurality ... and that people will
rally behind that person,'' he said in Boston.
   ``Obviously, I hope I will be that person.''
   Dukakis remained the Democratic delegate leader even after being
shut out of the delegate race in Illinois. The latest AP delegate
count gave him 464.5; Jackson 460.55; Gore 354.8; Simon 171.5 and
Gephardt 145, with 2,082 needed to nominate.
   Dukakis also continued to lead the Democratic field in federal
matching funds. The Federal Election Commission on Wednesday
certified Dukakis for another $600,000 in matching funds, bringing
his total to nearly $5.7 million.

   Ten-year-old Melissa Montgomery
transformed a class report on Mississippi into an adventure that
included a first-hand look at Civil War battlefields, a catfish
fry, grits, mud pie and lots of museums.
   The best part, Melissa said Wednesday after returning from her
five-day excursion into the Deep South, was the Impressionist
Gallery and its ``neat stuff.''
   The worst, she said, was the catfish, which she had to taste at
what Californians would have called a barbecue, but in the Deep
South is known as a fishfry.
   Not far behind the ugly creatures came a planetarium.
   ``You just look up. It's dumb,'' she said.
   It all started when the fifth-grader from John Swett Elementary
School showed her mother a rough draft of a report on Mississippi.
Melissa compiled it with the help of an encyclopedia a couple of
weeks ago.
   Her mother cringed at such stuffy phrases as ``institute of
higher learning,'' and decided there had to be a better way to
inspire her daughter.
   She called a visitors' bureau in Mississippi for a few
postcards, then asked the secretary of state's office for a book
outlining interesting and important facts about the state. But they
were all out.
   When someone suggested ``Y'all ought to come out and see
Mississippi for yourself,'' Melissa's mother, Kathryn, told them to
make some arrangement. Three days later, Melissa was bound for the
Magnolia State. She stayed with a Fred and Maridel Ingram, parents
of a fifth-grader at Casey Elementary in the capital of Jackson.
   On the trip financed in part by an anonymous donor, Melissa
visited such sites as the Mississippi River, the state Museum of
Natural Science, and also got to meet Gov. Ray Mabus.
   ``He just kind of shook my hand,'' she said. ``He was nice.''
   The excursion included a few too many museums for such an active
California girl, who would have preferred riding horses, swimming
or ice-skating. Instead, it was more of an educational and cultural
trip, she said.
   She was startled when Mississippi folks laughed at a West Coast
speech pattern she didn't know she had.
   ``I said, `you guys,' they said `y'all.' They think I have an
accent,'' said Melissa, sprawled on the couch back home amid
welcome home balloons and streamers.
   During her visit Melissa was dogged by reporters and camera
crews. ``I liked it at first, but after a while I got sick of it.''
Upon her return, she confided to her mother, ``Even Madonna hates
it.''
   She returned home laden with memories and trinkets such as a
bale of cotton, T-shirts, pens, and brochures reflecting aspects of
Mississippi life.
   ``When they talk about Southern hospitality, they're not
kidding,'' said her mother.
   ``The only thing's that's different,'' said Melissa, ``is their
attitude. They're really nice.''
   She had so much fun she has invited two of her new friends in
Mississippi to visit her in May.
   But first comes the hard part. Melissa's 50-page report complete
with pictures, maps and a replica of the state flag, is due
Wednesday.
   She's got 36 pages done but already is planning her next report.

   Susan Butcher left the competition behind on
the icy Bering Sea Coast and mushed through bone-chilling winds
Wednesday to claim her third straight victory in the 1,150-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher, 33, collected a $30,000 first prize by urging her
nine-dog team into the finish chute at 8:42 p.m., hours ahead of
her closest rival in the 16th annual Anchorage-to-Nome trek. She
had been on the trail for more than 11 days.
   ``I'm just amazed at what my dogs are doing, and what they've
done all year,'' said Butcher.
   Butcher said she would try next year for a fourth straight win.
``I very much want four, I guess I want five,'' she said.
   Hundreds of cheering fans braved the blustery 15-degree weather
to watch as Butcher became the first musher to win three
consecutive Iditarods. Butcher started the race with 17 dogs, but
dropped eight at checkpoints along the trail.
   ``I'm really happy,'' said Butcher's husband, Dave Monson, who
earlier this month won another long-distance Alaska sled dog race,
the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest. The couple run a kennel in the interior
Alaska village of Manley.
   ``We've had a tremendous year,'' Monson said. ``It shows that
hard work pays off sometimes.''
   Butcher's closest competitor, Martin Buser of Big Lake, was
trailing by at least 14 hours Wednesday. Butcher's longtime rival,
four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, was minutes
behind Buser for third place.
   Joe Garnie of Teller was running fourth, and 70-year-old Joe
Redington of Knik, who organized the first Iditarod in 1973 but has
never won the race, was fifth.
   Butcher had slept little since Monday, when she reached the
Bering Sea coast in Unalakleet, 229 miles from Nome. She said a
training run last month along the windy coast accustomed her team
to the punishing conditions.
   Tuesday night, Butcher guided her team through subzero
temperatures and winds that brought the wind chill factor down to
minus 70 degrees. Peeking out from a fur-ruffed parka, Butcher
suffered only a frost-nipped wrist.
   ``The wind was going right into my big mitt and up my arm. It's
still pretty sore,'' she said earlier Wednesday.
   One of Butcher's lead dogs this year was Granite, a husky that
led her to victory last year.
   Butcher, competing in her 11th Iditarod, long dreamed of being
the first woman musher to win, but that honor went to Libby Riddles
of Teller in 1985. Butcher won in 1986 and 1987, setting course
records each time.
   Last year, when the race followed its shorter southern route,
Butcher finished in 11 days, 2 hours.
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior Alaska, draws its inspiration from a 1925
relay of diphtheria serum to Nome, which was hit hard by an
outbreak of the disease.
   The race started March 5 on trucked-in snow. The temperature in
downtown Anchorage hovered around 32 degrees and climbed even
higher during the next few days, which strained the cold-loving
huskies.
   Fresh snow slowed the leaders as they climbed into the Alaska
Range. That gave an advantage to Redington, who had taken his
mandatory 24-hour layover early in the race and sailed past the
leaders on the trail they had packed down.
   Redington, known as the Father of the Iditarod, has entered all
but two of the race's 16 runnings and has placed as high as fifth.
For 400 miles, it seemed as if he might finally win, but he lost
the lead to Buser on the Yukon River.
   Butcher quickly caught up, passing Buser on Tuesday near Koyuk,
171 miles from the finish.
   Five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,200 American infantry and airborne
troops are flying to Honduras today in the most dramatic show of
U.S. force in the six-year Nicaraguan war, causing the Senate's top
Democrat to accuse President Reagan of ``overreaction.''
   The White House described the movement as ``an emergency
deployment readiness exercise'' triggered by what it called the
invasion of Honduras by 1,500 to 2,000 Nicaraguan forces pursuing
Contra rebels.
   The exercise involves two battalions of the 82nd Airborne
Division from Fort Bragg, N.C., and two battalions from the 7th
Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif.
   The troops will be posted out of harm's way for an indefinite
period near the Palmerola Air Force Base in Honduras, about 125
miles from the area of reported hostilities, said Marlin Fitzwater,
the president's spokesman.
   ``This exercise is a measured response designed to show our
staunch support to the democratic government of Honduras at a time
when its territorial integrity is being violated by the Cuban- and
Soviet-supported Sandinista army,'' Fitzwater said in a late-night
announcement.
   He said it also was ``a signal to the governments and peoples of
Central America of the seriousness with which the United States
government views the current situation in the region.''
   Some congressional Democrats weren't buying the administration's
rationale.
   ``It's an overreaction,'' said Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va. ``The Sandinistas have crossed over the border before
and gone back.''
   ``I just hope it's merited,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said,
recalling a similar incident two years ago when the United States
jumped to the aid of Honduras under circumstances many saw as
exaggerated by the White House. Then, as now, the development came
as the administration was pushing a reluctant Congress to approve
military aid to the Contras.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said, ``This is not the first
time the president has made use of his military authority after he
lost a vote on the Contras. President Reagan's decision to send the
82nd Airborne to Honduras has more to do with politics than with
American security. It is an irresponsible involvement of American
troops in the conflict in Central America and an unwise escalation
of tensions in that region.''
   However, a number of Republicans were supportive.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said the deployment
was intended ``psychologically to give an indication that we are
not just going to stand by and have Nicaragua ... make incursions
into neighboring countries.''
   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, said, ``I don't think the president
really had an alternative.''
   Congressional leaders were briefed by telephone late Wednesday.
   Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, said Congress would receive information today documenting
the Nicaraguan incursion.
   ``We will present evidence ... which proves conclusively that
there was a very large Sandinista incursion into Honduras, that
will show, I think, what to make of President Ortega's claim that
there isn't one single Nicaraguan soldier in Honduras. It's a
lie,'' Abrams said on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   Fitzwater said upwards of 2,000 Sandinistas are in Honduras.
``They are there and we have seen no evidence that they are
retreating to their own country.''
   The developments came as Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
White House officials conferred with congressional leaders about
the possibility of a new aid package for the Contra rebels trying
to topple Nicaragua's leftist regime.
   U.S. aid to the rebels ran out two weeks ago, and the
administration is hoping the new situation will earn the Contras
greater sympathy in Congress.
   Nicaraguan Defense Ministry officials denied Wednesday there was
any border crossing but later President Daniel Ortega appeared to
leave open that possibility.
   In a radio address, he said Sandinista forces had pushed back
the Contras into Honduras and that there was ``cross-fire from
Honduran territory against our forces.'' His remarks did not
confirm or deny the administration claims.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. deployment came in response to a request
from Honduran President Jose Azcona. He said Reagan was briefed on
the request about 8 p.m. EST in his residence and decided to send
in U.S. forces.
   ``As the president said when he was briefed on this issue, `When
friends ask for our support, we should provide it,''' Fitzwater
said.
   Some 12,500 American military personnel are stationed in Central
America, including roughly 10,000 who are located in Panama. Total
U.S. military manpower in Honduras varies from week to week,
depending upon the exercises being conducted.

   Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II and leading civil

``death squads'' where Northern Ireland is concerned.
   ``The British today, under the rule of Mrs. (Prime Minister
Margaret) Thatcher, are advocating just the kind of death squads
the Congress of the United States condemns every day,'' the
Massachusetts Democrat said outside the British Embassy on the eve
of St. Patrick's Day.
   Kennedy, the great-great-grandson of Irish immigrants, was
joined by Martin Luther King III, Cesar Chavez, the Rev. Joseph
Lowery, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Rep. Albert Bustamante,
D-Texas, for a 50-minute meeting with British Ambassador Antony
Acland.
   The long-scheduled embassy meeting came just hours after
attackers lobbed grenades and fired shots into a heavily attended
funeral in Belfast for three slain Irish Republican Army
guerrillas. The trio, unarmed, were shot March 6 by British troops
in Gilbraltar.
   British authorities say the three IRA members were on a bombing
mission. The outlawed IRA is fighting to push the British out of
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, which remains part of the
United Kingdom.
   Kennedy and the other activists condemned the violence of the
Catholic IRA and rival Protestant paramilitary units. But they
blamed the British government for providing ``enthusiastic
support'' to the British security forces and for not prosecuting
soldiers.
   ``Killers and perjurers should be brought to justice and the
world should know the truth,'' the group wrote in a letter to Mrs.
Thatcher delivered to the ambassador.
   After the closed meeting, Kennedy said Acland's comments
exemplified the ``callousness'' the British show toward the Irish.
   ``What we see today in Northern Ireland is complete abandonment
by the British government of real justice issues,'' Kennedy told
reporters outside the embassy compound. ``They're not fundamentally
committed to change in Northern Ireland.''
   The embassy said only that ``it was a frank discussion on both
sides.''
   But an embassy official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, derided the ``death squad'' analogy.
   ``We regard that frankly as over the top,'' the official said.
``Death squads imply shooting at will.'' British troops, the
official said, have strict orders to fire only if their lives or
others are in danger.
   Kennedy urged Britain to impose new laws to protect Catholics
against the type of discrimination that has resulted in up to 80
percent unemployment among Catholic men in some parts of Northern
Ireland.
   ``Unless you get people employed in that country, you're not
going to see the cycle of violence change,'' said Kennedy, a
freshman congressman and the eldest son of the late Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy.
   ``The fact is, folks, what we still face today in Northern
Ireland is discrimination, discrimination just as bad as we faced
in the 1960s and earlier in our country,'' he said.
   Kennedy lambasted new British proposals for fair employment
legislation as ``empty rhetoric'' that lack timetables demanding
tangible improvement.
   King, the son of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and
Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
said the arguments the ambassador gave against affirmative action
programs were the same ones voiced by opponents of the U.S. civil
rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.
   King, who said his father would have been at the embassy
Wednesday to protest Britain's actions if he were alive, said
discrimination ``in all its forms is wrong, whether it's in a
public place or a private boardroom in the United States, in South
Africa or in Ireland.''
   Quoting his slain father, King said: ``Injustice which is
allowed to flourish anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''

<HEAD>ATV Refunds Being Urged In House Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocates and industry are squaring
off over the question of whether unstable all-terrain vehicles
should be recalled, with even the federal Consumer Product Safety
Commission split on the issue.
   Legislation being considered in Congress would force makers of
the off-road machines to buy back three-wheeled versions. The
machines have been involved in more than 900 deaths and 300,000
injuries in the last five years.
   The recall measure would go beyond the settlement reached Monday
between industry, the Justice Department and CPSC.
   That consent agreement, yet to be approved by a federal judge,
calls for a ban on sales of the three-wheeled vehicles, provides
for advertising stressing the dangers of ATVs, and institutes
tougher safety programs and warnings for buyers of the new, more
stable, four-wheeled ATVs.
   But it lacks provisions for a recall of the estimated 1.5
million to 2 million three-wheeled ATVs already in use, an omission
that consumer advocates say could spell tragedy.
   ``The consent decree ... isn't good enough,'' Rep. James J.
Florio, D-N.J., said Wednesday at a hearing of the House Energy and
Commerce consumer protection subcommittee, which he chairs. ``It
fails to provide any real protection for those who bought the
admittedly dangerous three-wheelers in the past.
   ``The legislation before us, by requiring manufacturers to offer
refunds to past purchasers of three-wheel ATVs, provides this
necessary relief.''
   Susan A. Weiss of the Consumer Federation of America told the
subcommittee that the settlement announced Monday is ``simply
inadequate to stem this devastation.''
   Anne Graham, the lone CPSC member to oppose the settlement, said
she voted against it because it lacked a recall program.
   ``If three-wheeled ATVs are hazardous enough to stop their sale,
then certainly the millions of consumers who already own them
should be given the opportunity to return them,'' Graham said in
her testimony.
   Commission Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon argued that if Congress
were to countermand the negotiated agreement, other industries
might be discouraged from negotiating with the CPSC to obtain
remedies for consumers.
   Carol Dawson, the third member of the safety commission, told
the subcommittee, ``Those who bought ATVs because they believed ATV
marketing that these machines were safe and fun for the entire
family ought to have the right to a reasonable refund if they so
choose.''
   W.J. Michael Cody, Tennessee's attorney general, also presented
testimony supporting the refund legislation.
   ``Consumers who have already purchased an ATV had no notice or
inadequate notice of the risk of death and severe injury posed by
ATVs,'' Cody said. ``Manufacturers have affirmatively
misrepresented the characteristics of ATVs.''
   However, Lloyd Cutler, representing American Honda Motor Co.,
testified in favor of the settlement reached by the safety
commission.
   Legislation overriding that agreement and requiring refunds
would be ``unwise, unconstitutional and ... unprecedented,'' Cutler
told the subcommittee.
   Cutler questioned who would enter into settlements with
government agencies if Congress could reverse those agreements.

<HEAD>Committee Approves Minimum Wage Hike</HEAD>

   Moves by Congress to raise the federal minimum
wage this year will put presidential candidates on the spot and
force them to take a position on the issue, the chairman of the
House labor committee says.
   ``They like to say they are for a good education or a living
wage for everyone,'' said Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins. ``They will
have to discuss in detail the numbers that Congress sets. They
won't be able to just say they are for a living wage.''
   The House Labor and Education Committee on Wednesday ignored the
threat of a presidential veto and approved legislation to raise the
minimum wage from $3.35 per hour to $5.05 over the next four years.
   The measure, which passed after numerous Republican attempts to
weaken or gut it, now goes to the full House.
   ``This will be one of the great election issues,'' Hawkins,
D-Calif., said in an interview. ``Each candidate will be pinned
down.''
   The Democratic-controlled committee approved the measure by
voice vote after rejecting a Republican proposal to permit a
special ``new hire'' wage of $3.35 an hour.
   Hawkins said he expected the full House to take up the
legislation within 10 days after members return April 11 from their
Easter recess.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will take up a
similar bill during the week of April 11, according to its
chairman, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin says senior White House advisers
will urge President Reagan to veto any minimum wage increase that
would lead to a decrease in the number of job opportunities.
   The initial House bill would have raised the minimum to $4.65 an
hour over three years; that figure is still contained in the Senate
bill. The administration claims the proposal would result in
elimination of 880,000 jobs because employers won't be willing to
pay their workers that much.
   Under the House committee-passed bill, the minimum wage would go
to $3.85 an hour next year, $4.25 in 1990, $4.65 in 1991 and $5.05
in 1992.
   Last week, the committee added the fourth-year increase of 40
cents as a substitute for ``indexing'' _ or tying _ future raises
to inflation.
   Indexing was supported by Hawkins, Kennedy and organized labor,
but Democrats dropped the plan because they feared it would result
in little or no increase this year.
   The final version of the bill was sent to the House floor after
the committee defeated, 20-13, a proposal by Rep. Steve Bartlett,
R-Texas, to create a ``new hire'' or training wage by which
employers could pay new workers $3.35 an hour for 90 days.
   Bartlett said the White House told him the president would veto
any legislation not containing a lower starting wage.
   Rep. Matthew G. Martinez, D-Calif., called the training wage
proposal ``a sham, a joke and a fraud.'' He said it was ``nothing
more than a way to get around the minimum wage.''
   The committee also rejected another Bartlett amendment which
would have given private employers the right to grant compensatory
time off in lieu of wages for overtime.
   Also defeated by a voice vote was an amendment by Rep. Thomas E.
Petri, R-Wis., to permit employers to include the cost of fringe
benefits, such as health insurance, in the calculation of the
minimum wage and an amendment by Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa.,
to exempt motorcycle dealers from paying overtime.
   Robert McGlotten, legislative director of the AFL-CIO, said the
committee ``recognized the need to bring this nation's working poor
to at least the poverty level by gradually raising the minimum
wage.''

<HEAD>More Rice Than Before Is Being Used In Brewing Beer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn is the most plentiful farm crop grown in
the United States but is losing ground among brewers.
   The Agriculture Department says only 34.5 million bushels of
corn were used to make beer in 1987, the smallest amount in 25
years. Just a decade ago, American brewers used 53.6 million
bushels of corn.
   ``Rice production has increased, and lots of the lower grades go
into breweries,'' said Larry Van Meir of the department's Economic
Research Service.
   In 1961, he told The Associated Press, breweries used about 3.4
million hundredweight of rice. By last year more than 15 million
hundredweight were used to make beer.
   Corn is still ahead of rice in the brewer's art, however. The
34.5 million bushels, at 56 pounds per bushel, converts to about
19.3 million hundredweight, compared with the 15 million
hundredweight of rice.
   Moreover, corn used to make beer is only a small part of the
huge supply. The brewery figures were based on corn produced and
used in the 1986-87 crop marketing year, which included the bumper
1986 corn harvest of 8.25 billion bushels.
   Of that amount, more than 4.7 billion bushels were fed to
livestock; 1.5 billion bushels were exported; and less than 1.2
billion bushels went into food, seed and industrial uses, which
includes corn flakes, alcohol and beer.
   Van Meir's agency says in a new report that the use of corn for
food, seed and industrial purposes, called FSI by the economists,
is expected to continue growing at an annual rate of 3 percent to 4
percent, despite the decline in beer use.
   Since 1980, the largest single use of corn in the FSI category
has been the manufacture of high-fructose corn syrup, abbreviated
in the trade to HFCS. Of the 1.2 billion bushels that went into
food, seed and industrial uses in 1986-87, some 339 million bushels
were used to make HFCS.
   The rise of HFCS has been linked to a decline in the use of
sugar in soft drinks and many other food products, including baked
goods, dairy and cereal products.
   Corn also is a source of glucose and dextrose, two other
sweeteners, and starch for a long list of industrial purposes in
the paper and corrugating industries, and by pharmaceutical,
building, textile and food manufacturers.
   Department analysts estimate that about 300 million bushels of
corn were used to make ethanol in 1986-87, the fuel-grade alcohol
that is blended with gasoline.
   Use of corn for ethanol is expected to increase 3 percent to 5
percent this year, much slower than the double-digit annual
increases in 1979 through 1985.
   ``Monthly sales of ethanol-blended fuel again reached new
records during the first seven months of calendar 1987,'' the
report said. ``However, as in 1986, sales fell off during late
summer and the fall months.''
   The report explained: ``One of the reasons for lower ethanol
sales in the summer is the strong competition for wet-million
capacity. Heavy demand for HFCS in soft drinks in the summer, along
with the fact that HFCS cannot be stored for long periods of time,
means that any wet-milling capacity that has the ability to shift
moves into higher-profit HFCS production.''
   In the fall, the plants again shift into ethanol production as
the demand for HFCS declines. However, seasonal demand for
automotive fuel and, presumably, ethanol, also declines at that
time.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
200,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement between the two countries, the
Agriculture Department says.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 200,000 tons of
corn announced Wednesday would be about 7.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices recently have been averaging about $1.83 per bushel
at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of
around $14.5 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 3.47
million tons of corn, plus more than 6.9 million tons of wheat;
813,300 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

   An Agriculture Department report says Thailand
may import soybeans for the first time since 1981 due to drought
and a shortage of the oilseed.
   The department's Foreign Agricultural Service said also
Wednesday that a decision is expected about the country's import
quota for soybean meal. Feed mills and livestock producers,
meanwhile, have turned to other oilseed meals not restricted by
quotas, such as sunflowerseed meal and peanut meal.
   Meanwhile, the United States has been ``working to liberalize
Thailand's oilseed trade'' by encouraging the Thai government to
use import tariffs instead of the current system, which includes
bans on imported soybeans, a quota on soybean meal, and licensing
for vegetable oil, the report said.

^Tip O'Neill Says Brokered Convention Would Be Good Fun; Few Dems
Concur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talk of a brokered convention is making some
Democrats shudder, while former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill says he thinks it would be a lot of fun and other party
leaders say the scenario probably will be avoided one way or
another.
   ``A brokered convention is nothing,'' said O'Neill on Wednesday
evening. He recalled the brokered 1952 convention that nominated
Adlai Stevenson and said, ``It was enjoyable ... it makes it more
fun.''
   ``If I had my way _ they talk about the smoke-filled rooms _ we
ought to open them up to the TV and the press,'' he said in an
interview Wednesday night.
   Sen. Paul Simon's favorite-son primary victory in Illinois on
Tuesday brought the brokered convention speculation to the fore,
along with concerns that the Democrats could only be hurt by such a
lack of unity.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who some hope would emerge the
nominee if there were a deadlocked convention, condemned the
possibility as ``the best way to give this election away to the
Republicans.''
   He joined Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk in
calling for the Democratic leadership to unify behind the
front-runner when the primary season ends in June, rather than wait
until the July convention in Atlanta.
   Simon, reviving his faltering campaign, took most of the
delegates in Illinois, with the other home-state candidate, Jesse
Jackson, coming in second and taking the rest of the delegates.
   Simon said no one will have enough delegates to lock up the
nomination before the convention, and added, ``We're going to have
to work out some kind of a compromise.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who currently holds a slim
lead in delegates, said the party should unite behind the
front-runner at the end of the primary season, and that encouraging
a brokered convention ``would be a very dangerous thing.''
   ``I think there is agreement on the part of most Democrats
across the country that somebody will come out of this primary
process with, if not an absolute majority, a substantial plurality
... and that people will rally behind that person. Obviously, I
hope I will be that person,'' the governor said in Boston.
   But other prominent Democrats, interviewed Wednesday at a
congressional dinner, professed not to be worried about the
deadlocked convention prospect, mostly because they don't think it
will come to that.
   ``Nobody said the process had to end by March,'' said Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee.
   But he said he thinks his candidate, Dukakis, will have enough
delegates to take the nomination by June, and that ``the process is
going to work its way out.''
   Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, who opted not to seek the
presidential nomination this year, said he doubts anyone will have
a winning cache of delegates in June. But he predicted that the
party would unite behind a candidate before the convention.
   Nonetheless, he added, ``I don't fear a brokered convention ...
I don't think any harm comes from it.''
   After Illinois, Dukakis had 464.5 delegate votes, Jackson 460.55
and Simon 171.5. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee had 354.8 and
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri 145. Uncommitted delegates
totaled 272.65 of the 2,082 needed to win the nomination.
   Boosted by his Illinois win, Simon plans to campaign vigorously
for the upcoming Michigan caucuses March 26 and the Wisconsin
primary April 5.
   Gore, who fared poorly in Illinois, said he is ``almost
prepared'' to agree that the race will still be fluid at the
convention.
   ``I still think this process is likely to produce a winner
before the first ballot is over,'' Gore said. ``The results (from
Illinois) ... make it more likely we will go to a second ballot.''
   Gephardt, who skipped Illinois to try to resuscitate his
campaign in Michigan, said the Democratic battle could go all the
way.
   ``The race is wide open,'' he said in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``I think
if I can get a good result in Michigan, which I think I can, I'm
going to be back in the middle of this thing and have a great
chance to be the nominee.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said Wednesday night he
anticipated he would be involved in any discussions to unite behind
a candidate before the convention if no one had the winning number
of delegates in June.
   He said a brokered convention wouldn't be the worst thing, but
added, ``All things considered, it would be desirable if it didn't
happen.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey on Wednesday signaled the
likelihood that he, too, would help in early selection of a
nominee. First, he told party leaders in his home state that he
would endorse a candidate before the primary there June 7, with
Dukakis the favorite for his backing.
   And he said party leaders should halt an effort to put together
an uncommitted delegate slate for the state. Victory for such a
slate, he said, could cause problems for the front-running
candidate when the primary is held.

<HEAD>Former Chief U.S. Delegate To Vietnam Peace Talks Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Porter, the chief U.S.
delegate to the Paris peace talks that ended the Vietnam War, has
died of cancer. He was 73.
   Porter, who had served in many diplomatic posts, died Tuesday at
a nursing home.
   A native of Staleybridge, England, he became a U.S. citizen in
1936 when he was 22. He began his foreign service that year as
private secretary to the U.S. ambassador in Budapest.
   From 1962 to 1965, Porter served as the first U.S. ambassador to
Algeria. He later served as deputy ambassador to South Vietnam,
ambassador to South Korea, undersecretary of state for political
affairs and ambassador to Canada. He retired in 1977 as ambassador
to Saudi Arabia.
   In July 1971, President Nixon named Porter chief delegate to the
Paris talks to succeed David K.E. Bruce, who was retiring because
of illness.
   Porter and his mother immigrated to Fall River from England
after his father, a Royal Navy officer, was killed in World War I.
   Before becoming ambassador to Algeria, he had served as a
diplomatic aide in Iraq, Lebanon, Jerusalem, Cyprus and Morocco,
and as political adviser to the chief of Voice of America and
director of the State Department's office of North African affairs.
   In 1941, he was credited with rescuing three American missionary
couples who were trapped in their homes in Baghdad during two days
of rioting in which Iraqis killed more than 500 Jews.
   He married Eleanore Henry, an Army nurse from Philadelphia,
while in Syria in 1944.
   Survivors include his wife, a son and a daughter.
   A funeral Mass is to be said Friday at St. John the Baptist
Church in Westport.

   Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is
leaving the door open for further criminal charges in the
Iran-Contra affair following the indictment of Lt. Col. Oliver
North and three others on charges of ``deceitfully exploiting''
U.S. weapons sales to Iran.
   The 23-count indictment charging that North, former national
security adviser John Poindexter and two weapons dealers engaged in
a criminal conspiracy ``is simply an interim report'' of the grand
jury's 14-month investigation, Walsh told reporters.
   ``The grand jury is not finished,'' Walsh said Wednesday after
the panel returned the 101-page indictment against North,
Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   Grand jurors will continue to meet because ``they have
uncompleted investigations,'' Walsh said, refusing to say if more
criminal charges would be brought.
   The indictment charges that the defendants circumvented a
statutory ban on U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels
``by deceitfully and without legal authorization'' setting up a
clandestine private arms supply network.
   It also says the four conspired to defraud the government ``by
deceitfully exploiting for their own purposes and corrupting'' the
U.S. arms sales to Iran that were approved by President Reagan in
an attempt to win release of American hostages in Lebanon.
   The U.S. government was cheated out of its rightful proceeds
from the sale of $30 million dollars worth of weaponry to Iran, the
indictment said. The government received only $12.2 million.
   All four defendants were charged with conspiracy, theft of
government property and wire fraud, stemming from the diversion of
arms-sale profits to the Contras to Swiss bank accounts controlled
by Hakim and Secord.
   Together, these charges carry a maximum 25-year sentence and
each of the three counts has a potential fine of $250,000.
   The indictment raises the question of whether Reagan will issue
pardons to those charged or convicted as a result of the
Iran-Contra affair. Reagan, who has refused to rule out pardons for
his former aides, ``had no response'' to the latest development in
the scandal, said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   North, who was fired from his White House post in November 1986,
was named in 16 counts. He also was charged with obstructing
Attorney General Edwin Meese III's Nov. 21-23, 1986, investigation
by making false statements and destroying National Security Council
documents.
   Secord and Hakim were additionally charged with conspiring to
pay North illegal gratuities by agreeing to set up a $200,000 Swiss
bank account for the Marine officer's family and to pay for the
installation of a security system at North's home in Great Falls,
Va.
   North was accused of accepting the security system and pocketing
$4,500 of $90,000 in travelers checks he received from a Contra
leader to cover expenses of helping the rebels.
   The gratuities were offered to ``encourage North to continue in
his position'' at the White House so Secord and Hakim ``would
continue to receive opportunities for substantial revenues and
profits'' from the arms sales, the indictment said.
   Secord and North agreed the ``Enterprise'' would keep most of
the proceeds from the sale of TOW missiles to Iran in February
1986, the indictment said.
   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral, also was charged with
four counts of obstructing congressional inquiries and deleting
National Security Council computer records shortly after the
Iran-Contra affair unraveled in November 1986.
   Last week, another of Reagan's former national security
advisers, Robert C. McFarlane, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor
charges of withholding information from Congress about the covert
aid efforts.
   North also was charged with illegally using a tax-exempt
foundation, the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty,
to raise $3.2 million for the Contras.
   North, who was fired from the NSC staff in November 1986, told
reporters: ``I did not commit any crime. I intend to fight the
allegations of wrongdoing for as long as necessary.''
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell, 77,
an appointee of President Johnson who presided at one of the
Watergate trials and ruled in favor of The Washington Post's
publication of the Pentagon papers.
   Secord said on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' that the charges were
``crazy.''
   ``We're going to defend this case successfully,'' he said.
   N. Richard Janis, who represents Hakim, said ``we believe
strongly that Mr. Hakim has committed no crimes and that this
indictment is unfair and unwarranted.'' Poindexter's lawyer,
Richard Beckler, told The Washington Post that ``we're going to
vigorously contest this case.''

<HEAD>Delay Urged In Action Aimed At Opening Japanese Construction
Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's top economic advisers have
urged a two-week delay in proposed action seeking to open Japan's
multibillion construction market to U.S. companies, administration
officials say.
   The delay, backed on Tuesday by Reagan's Cabinet-level Economic
Policy Committee, will permit time for last-ditch negotiations,
requested by Japan, to resolve the dispute, said officials who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   However, if the negotiations _ to begin this weekend _ fail,
then the administration is likely to proceed with the trade case,
which could result in stiff retaliatory tariffs against Japan, the
sources said.
   The council, headed by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III,
put off a recommendation by senior staff members calling for
presidential action against Japan on the issue, pending the result
of the talks, the sources said.
   Japan will send a special negotiating team to Washington this
weekend to meet with U.S. officials in an effort to end the bitter
dispute, said the officials.
   ``They proposed sending a high-level representative to meet with
us. We've taken them up on it,'' said one administration official
present at the Cabinet session.
   The Cabinet unit agreed that there ``would be no
pre-conditions'' on the negotiations, and that the results would
have to be satisfactory to both nations for further action to be
abandoned, the official said.
   Failure of U.S. construction companies to win contracts on
Japanese public works projects, including the new $8 billion Kansai
International Airport, has been a major trade irritant between the
two nations.
   Last month, top administration staff members recommended that
President Reagan initiate a trade action against Japan on grounds
that Japan has resisted opening its construction market to U.S.
companies.
   According to the sources, Commerce Secretary C. William Verity
opened Tuesday's session with a call for initiation of the trade
action against Japan _ an action that could result in tariffs equal
to the amount of lost business to U.S. construction companies.
   However, the Cabinet was told of a new offer by Japan to resolve
the dispute, and the group agreed to await the result of the
two-week talks before recommending further action to President
Reagan, the sources said.
   U.S. construction companies claim they have been all but barred
from bidding on such projects in Japan. Some $60 billion of
Japanese construction projects are at stake, according to industry
officials.
   Japanese Prime Minister Naburo Takeshita, in his visit with
President Reagan earlier this year, brought with him a proposal he
said would open more Japanese construction projects to U.S.
companies.
   However, the administration said that the proposal _ which
focused on joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese companies _ did
not go nearly far enough.
   Japanse construction firms, by contrast, do an estimated $1.8
billion worth of business each year in the United States.
   However, Congress late last year voted to ban future Japanese
participation in U.S. public works projects _ which include planned
work on a segment of the Washington subway system _ until the issue
is resolved.
   U.S. construction industry officials have claimed that Japanese
red tape for bidding on such projects in Japan makes it virtually
impossible for Americans to win contracts.
   For instance, they claim, one requirement for participation in
such projects is extensive prior experience on similar Japanese
projects _ experience that U.S. industry officials claim it is
almost impossible for American outfits to acquire.

<HEAD>Survey Finds 3-1 in Favor Of Higher Taxes Rather Than Cutting
Programs</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release at 10 a.m. EST - time set by source</NOTE>

   Three times as many Americans would raise
taxes rather than cut Medicare and other social programs to reduce
the federal budget deficit, according to a survey released today.
   But a third option _ cutting defense spending _ was favored by
the majority of those questioned in a Gallup Poll.
   ``The American public clearly is not inclined to cut entitlement
programs in order to reduce the federal budget deficit,'' said
Gallup Vice President Harry Cotugno in an analysis of the poll.
   The telephone survey of 1,014 people from Jan. 10-23 found 10
percent approved of cutting entitlement programs, 33 percent
favored higher taxes and 59 percent cutting defense spending.
   That left 87 percent disapproving of cutting entitlement
programs _ in the questionnaire's words _ ``such as Social
Security, Medicare and the like.''
   The ``raise taxes'' option, disapproved by 52 percent, did not
specify which taxes and the ``cut spending on defense'' _
disapproved by 36 percent _ likewise did not specify where the cuts
would come.
   The totals of those approving and disapproving the three options
exceeds 100 percent because each person was asked to give an
opinion on each of the options, not pick one of the three.
   The survey was commissioned by the Federation of American Health
Systems, a trade organization representing about 1,300 private
hospitals, and released in conjunction with its annual convention.
   Health advisers to several presidential candidates _ including
Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis _
were scheduled to appear on a panel today.
   One of the questions in the survey asked whether respondents
would be more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate who
favored a large increase in defense spending, cuts in Medicare or
Medicaid and increasing taxes.
   Three-quarters said they would be less likely to vote for a
candidate who favored Medicare or Medicaid cuts and 65 percent said
they would be less likely to support a candidate advocating more
defense spending.
   Cotugno said those figures showed a significant shift from a
similar survey taken for Newsweek in 1982.
   ``The proportion likely to vote for a candidate in favor of
increased spending for defense has been cut in half, from 28
percent to 12 percent, while the proportion who are less likely to
vote (for such a candidate) has risen from 44 percent in 1982 to 65
percent this year,'' he said.
   Just under half _ 49 percent _ said they would be less likely to
support a candidate who favored increasing taxes and 26 percent
said such a stand would make them more likely to vote for a
candidate with a tax-raising position.
   Another question gave four ``if you had to choose'' options for
reducing the deficit.
   Given that choice, 43 percent said take money from defense, 21
percent said give up ``a portion of the next phase of the federal
tax cut,'' 18 percent said give up having a balanced budget and 3
percent said take money from health care programs. The rest had no
opinion.
   The margin of error for the poll was 4 percentage points.

   North, a Marine lieutenant colonel, is a former member of the
National Security Council staff. He played the central role in
supervising the arms shipments to Iran and in helping coordinate
assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels during the 1985-86 period when
Congress barred U.S. government aid for the rebels.
   He was fired from his NSC post in November 1986 when the
Iran-Contra affair first became public.
   Born in San Antonio, Texas, North, 44, was raised in Philmont,
N.Y. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, where he was a
boxing champion. He received numerous medals for heroism in the
Vietnam War. North and his wife, Betsy, have four children. He
lives in Great Falls, Va.

nuclear physics from California Institute of Technology in 1964.
   He joined the National Security Council staff in June 1981 as a
military assistant, succeeding Robert C. McFarlane as President
Reagan's national security adviser in December 1985. Earlier in his
career he was on the personal staff of three Navy secretaries and
was the top assistant to the chief of naval operations.
   His wife, Linda, is an ordained Episcopal priest. They have five
sons.

   Secord, 55, a retired major general in the Air Force, spent
virtually his entire career in the military. A native of LaRue,
Ohio, Secord graduated from West Point. He was one of the first
American combat pilots in Vietnam. Early in his career, he also ran
bombing missions for the CIA from Laos. He resigned from the Air
Force in 1983 after federal investigators looked into his
relationship with former CIA agent Edwin Wilson, who was convicted
of selling weapons to Libya.
   Secord and his business associate, Albert Hakim, were the two
most prominent figures among the clandestine operators who assisted
North in supplying the Nicaraguan Contras.

   Hakim, 51, a naturalized American born in Iran, is a businessman
based in Los Gatos, Calif. Hakim left Iran for good in 1978 when
the shah of Iran was forced from power. In the mid-1970s, Hakim met
Secord in Tehran; the two later became business partners.
   Hakim travels frequently, rarely staying in the same place for
long. His second wife was born in South Korea. Investigators say
Hakim was the money man who handled the accounts and financial
arrangements in the Iran-Contra affair.

   Here is a transcript of the statement
Wednesday night by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on
President Reagan's decision to send U.S. military battalions on an
``emergency deployment readiness exercise'' to Honduras:
   In light of the significant cross-border incursion by Sandinista
armed forces into Honduras from Nicaragua, and at the request of
the government of Honduras, the president has ordered the immediate
deployment of an infantry brigade task force consisting of two
battalions of the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg (N.C.),
two battalions from the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif.,
plus supporting units to Palmerola Air Force Base in Honduras for
an emergency deployment readiness exercise.
   In addition to its value as a test of the proficiency of our
military units, this exercise is a measured response designed to
show our staunch support to the democratic government of Honduras,
at a time when its territorial integrity is being violated by the
Cuban- and Soviet-supported Sandinista army.
   This exercise is also intended as a signal to the governments
and peoples of Central America of the seriousness with which the
U.S. government views the current situation in the region.
   The duration of this exercise has not been decided.
   The brigade task force will not be deployed to any area of
ongoing hostilities.

   Here is the text of the letter from Honduran
President Jose Azcona to President Reagan:
   His Excellency Tegucigalpa
   Ronald Reagan March 15, 1988
   President of the United States
   Washington, D.C.
   Dear Mr. President:
   I have the honor of addressing your excellency, first of all to
inform you that today Nicarauga army troops crossed the border
limits between Honduras and Nicaragua, attacking, with artillery
fire and combat aircraft support, locations situated in Honduran
territory in southeast Olancho department.
   With the purpose of preventing the worsening of the situation on
the frontier, I have demanded of President Ortega that he order his
troops to abstain from violating national territory, and
immediately redeploy to their territory the military units that
have invaded Honduras.
   I have also communicated with Presidents Jose Napoleon Duarte,
Vinicio Cerezo and Oscar Arias Sanchez to ask that they demand that
the government of Nicaragua stop its aggression against Honduras
and remove the troops from the border region.
   My government, exercising the right of legitimate defense,
consecrated in Article 51 of the charter of the United Nations, has
proceeded immediately to execute the necessary actions to repel the
invasion of which it is the object, ordering its armed forces to
repulse the troops of the Sandinista popular army.
   In view of the unjustifiable aggression and the evident
disadvantage in which, in terms of numbers of military forces and
armaments, my country finds itself in relation to the aggressor
forces, my government finds itself forced to appeal for continental
solidarity to repel the aggression of which it is subject and to
reestablish peace in the region.
   The actions taken by the invading army represent, before
international law, an act of aggression that as a result should be
considered as an attack against all the states of the American
continent.
   Therefore, in conformity with what is established in the cited
Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, in articles 3, 8,
and 9 of the Inter-American Treaty for Reciprocal Assistance; by
virtue of the special security relations existing between our two
states and the dispositions of the military assistance agreement
that was signed on the 20th of May 1954, I find myself required to
ask your illustrious government for effective and immediate
assistance to maintain the sovereign and territorial integrity of
my country.
   I have the conviction that you share with me, Mr. President,
that certainty that combined action by both nations is necessary to
defeat this new aggression of the Sandinista regime.
   The occasion is propitious to reiterate to your excellency the
assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration.
   Signed,
   Jose Azcona H.
   President

<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gangster who testified he killed a
Chinese-American journalist on orders of the Taiwanese government
was convicted of murder by a jury that deliberated just 45 minutes.
   Tung Kuie-sen, a member of the international United Bamboo Gang,
was convicted Wednesday of first-degree murder in the Oct. 15,
1984, slaying of dissident writer Henry Liu, who was gunned down in
his garage in Daly City.
   Tung, 36, admitted to the San Mateo County Superior Court jury
that he killed Liu, but he claimed he carried out the act for
patriotic rfused to
offer a plea bargain and Tung wanted to tell his side of the story
in public, said defense attorney Douglas Gray.
   Judge Margaret J. Kemp set Tung's sentencing for May 11. Tung
faces 25 years to life in prison for murder and two years for use
of a firearm.
   Earlier Wednesday, during cross-examination, Tung testified the
plot to murder Liu went as high as the then-head of Taiwan's secret
police, who also was the son of President Chiang Ching-kuo, who
died in January.
   Liu was known for his writings critical of Chiang. Some of the
writings included personal details of the lives of Taiwan's ruling
family.
   Tung is the only one of Liu's suspected killers to be brought to
trial in the United States.
   Wang Hsi-ling, the Taiwanese vice admiral who some believe
orchestrated the plot, and his two aides were convicted in Taiwan
of the murder and are serving life sentences.
   Wang reportedly wanted Liu killed because he feared he was about
to embarrass Chiang by publishing memoirs of a former high-ranking
Taiwanese official.
   Tung testified he believed he was duped by his own government
into killing a man who was not a traitor. Tung asked in a written
statement sent to the judge Wednesday that a written apology be
given to Liu's widow, Helen.
   Tung confessed to his role in Liu's killing two years ago during
a heroin smuggling trial in federal court in New York. Tung was
acquitted of racketeering in that case, but found guilty of
smuggling 660 pounds of heroin into the United States.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a statement read by Lt.
Col. Oliver North at the office of his lawyer, Brendan Sullivan,
after a grand jury indicted North in the Iran-Contra case on
Wednesday.
   It is a sad irony that the decision to indict me should occur
today, a day in which the communists in Nicaragua invaded their
democratic neighbor, a day which is the fourth anniversary of the
abduction of William Buckley and the third anniversary of the
kidnapping of Terry Anderson, two of the American hostages we tried
so hard to rescue.
   Hopefully, Mr. Anderson is still alive and will be freed soon.
   The indictment is also sad for our country, for all the men and
women who work to protect it and to make our government work.
   It is a particularly painful thing to my wife, Betsy, our four
children and me.
   Throughout my service as a Marine officer I have always done my
very best, often working night and day to get the job done and to
do so honorably.
   I am proud of my service to our country and those with whom I
have served, both in the Marine Corps and on the National Security
Council.
   Unfortunately, I have now been caught in a bitter dispute
between the Congress and the president over the control of foreign
policy, the power of the president to deter communism in Central
America and the president's duty to protect our citizens against
terrorist acts abroad.
   It is a shame that the new battleground for such a fight will be
a courtroom.
   I did not commit any crime.
   I intend to fight allegations of wrongdoing for as long as
necessary.
   I recognize that opposing a prosecutor with an unlimited budget,
a staff of 30 lawyers, 50 investigators, scores of support
personnel is a formidable task for me and my counsel, Brendan
Sullivan.
   There are enormous costs involved both personal and financial.
   The months ahead will be difficult and often very lonely.
   Nonetheless, I can assure you I will never give up, we will win,
I just cannot tell you how soon.
   And finally to the American people who have shown so much love
and concern these past 16 months by their millions of telegrams and
letters and prayers and support, I want to tell you again how
extremely grateful I am for that.
   You have helped my family and me find the strength to endure
this seemingly endless ordeal in Washington.
   You have shown your appreciation for what we did accomplish and
what we tried to achieve.
   For that I thank you again. God bless you.

<DATELINE>FORT ORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convoys of Army vehicles moved out of
Fort Ord late Wednesday, hours after word was received that two
base battalions would be sent to Honduras to counter the reported
incursion of Nicaraguan forces into that country.
   Three convoys of about 15 vehicles each, carrying both troops
and supplies, left the base shortly before midnight, apparently
bound for Travis Air Force Base, 125 miles north.
   The sprawling Army base on the Monterey Peninsula was in the
midst of an emergency exercise on Wednesday when it was informed
that the two units, consisting of at least 1,200 soliders, would be
sent to Honduras.
   The White House announced that President Reagan was sending
about 3,200 troops in an emergency deployment exercise to southern
Honduras as a ``measured response'' to an incursion of Nicaraguan
forces into that country.
   Nicaragua denied that its troops had entered Honduras.
   The American force includes about two battalions from the 7th
Infantry Division Light at Ford Ord and two from the 82nd Airborne
Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., plus support units, the White House
said.
   Fort Bragg officials said 1,400 to 1,500 soldiers would leave
the base at 6:30 a.m. Thursday.
   ``It was really exciting,'' Pfc. Eugene Rice, 21, told The
Charlotte (N.C.) Observer. ``It was like, something's really going
to happen. We're finally going to get a chance to use our
training.''
   Paul Boyce, a spokesman at Fort Ord, said the emergency
deployment exercise was routine and had started early Wednesday.
   All 11,400 members of Fort Ord's Rapid Deployment Force
participated in the daylong exercise, which involved recalling
troops to the base for the checking of weapons, vehicles,
identifications and other equipment, he said.
   The Rapid Deployment Force is trained to respond at a moment's
notice to assignments throughout the world.
   There are 21,000 soldiers at Fort Ord, about 80 miles south of
San Francisco. Details of the transfer of troops were not
immediately available. Telephones at the base went unanswered or
were busy Wednesday night.
   Several wives were told by their husbands that the battalions
would leave from Travis, where they would be flown to Florida and
then onto Honduras. Travis officials said they could not confirm
that arrangement.
   ``I'm real terrfied, and so are all the wives,'' said Sheila
Baesler.
   Karen Brylewski, a civilian base worker, said her husband told
her that his unit and the battalions would be flown to Florida from
Travis on Thursday morning.
   ``He said some of the guys (on guard duty) are crying but (he
said) everybody has to be strong,'' she told the Monterey Herald.
Brylkewski said she spent most of the evening talking by telephone
with relatives of soldiers.
   ``We're just hoping and praying nothing serious comes from
this,'' she said. ``I just don't want anybody to get hurt.''
   Elsewhere at Fort Ord, the mood was somber. Mildred McIntyre,
cashier at an officers club, said there were only about 30 people
there, two-thirds of them women. A normal night sees up to 250
people, she said.
   ``This is ladies' night, and we normally have an excellent
crowd,'' she said. `` Many of the females are saying their fiances,
husbands, boyfriends are on alert, and they're depressed about
that.''
   Fort Bragg is home to paratrooper units of the 82nd Airborne and
the Green Berets and has been called upon to send combat-ready
soldiers to trouble spots around the world.
   The 82nd Airborne was sent to Grenada for the U.S. invasion of
the Caribbean Island in October 1983, and President Reagan also
chose the unit to help keep peace in the Sinai.
   The Fayetteville (N.C.) Times reported Wednesday night, before
the White House announcement, that roads to the 82nd Airborne
headquarters had been closed, and officers at checkpoints were
allowing only authorized military personnel through.
   During the day Wednesday, the post outside Fayetteville was
abuzz with heavy-truck convoys carrying explosives, supplies were
being loaded at klieg-lighted parking lots and cars were being
stopped at Military Police checkpoints.
   Maj. Mike Nason, spokesman for the 82nd Airborne, said: ``I'm
really not at liberty to talk to you, but we're leaning forward in
the foxholes. We're watching CNN (Cable News Network) just like you
are.''
   Wives were seen dropping off their husbands in in combat gear.
Asked what what was happening, one began to cry and to the News and
Observer of Raleigh: ``I just can't answer any questions.''
   ``They told us to get our stuff together,'' one unidentified
soldier told the newspaper. ``They're rigging trucks that they've
never rigged before. People don't know what to think. They don't
know whether we're going to war or just doing a little
peace-keeping. They're on ends right now.''
   Capt. Donald M. Sensing, an Army spokesman at Fort Bragg, said
that if paratroopers from Fort Bragg were ordered into battle, they
and their equipment would be transported in much the same way as
they were during Market Square One, a special four-day mock war
game held in October 1986.
   Then, the entire division _ including helicopters, rank-and-file
infantry, artillery units and support units _ was mobilized as if
they had been called into battle. They were airlifted out of South
Carolina and from Pope Air Force Base.

<HEAD>Text Of Walsh Comments On Indictment In Iran-Contra Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iran-Contra Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of remarks to reporters
Wednesday by Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh on
the indictment of John M. Poindexter, Oliver L. North, Richard V.
Secord and Albert Hakim in the Iran-Contra case.
   The grand jury indicted four defendants: John M. Poindexter,
Oliver L. North, Richard V. Secord, and Albert Hakim.
   There are altogether _ well, there are three counts which
include all four defendants.
   The first is conspiracy to defraud the United States, which
consists of a charge of three illegal objectives; the first of
those objectives is to impair and obstruct the compliance with
legal requirements for government covert activities by organizing,
directing and concealing a program of support for the paramilitary
activities in Nicaragua by the Contras at a time when the Boland
Act was in effect, and when other restrictions on covert activities
were in effect.
   I note parenthetically that it does not charge a violation of
the Boland Act, it charges the objective of conducting unauthorized
covert activities.
   The second objective of the conspiracy as charged is the use _
or is the _ the use of private individuals by the government
employee defendants to generate a fund which could be used without
government accountability for the conduct of covert activities,
including the support of the paramilitary activities in Nicaragua
of the Contras.
   And the third charged illegal objective of the conspiracy is to
deprive the _ to defraud the United States by depriving it of the
full control of the Iranian initiative by using the _ by corrupting
that initiative for the diversion of funds to private individuals
where they would be subject _ where they could be used for covert
activities designated by the government employee defendants.
   Q. Mr. Walsh _
   A. Do you want me to give you the other charges?
   Q. I'm sorry, I thought you'd done your three.
   A. No, no. That's just the conspiracy.
   Those are the three objectives of the conspiracy.
   Then the next count on which all four defendants are named is
the theft of government property.
   And that charges the embezzlement of funds generated _ of funds
and other things of value of the government generated in the Iran
initiative for _ to private persons, again, to be used for
unauthorized purposes.
   And the third count in which all four defendants are named is a
_ is fraud by wire, which alleges again this same diversion, but
also alleges false pretenses.
   Then the additional charges, there are about 13 charges of
obstruction of investigation and false statements.
   These are against _ nine are against North individually, four
are against Poindexter individually.
   They also include the destruction of records as part of the
obstruction.
   There is also a count against North on the destruction of
records alone.
   Then there are five counts that deal with gratuities.
   Two charge efforts by Secord and Hakim to supply gratuities to
North, and one charges a gift by Secord of the security system,
another charges the acceptance by North of the security system, and
another charges North (with) obstruction of our investigation by
developing false documents to conceal his acceptance of that gift.
   The next count charges North's conversion of traveler's checks
which he received from Calero, a Contra leader, for government
purposes. ...
   Q. Judge, could you _
   A. And the fifth _ one more. That's the last one.
   The last count charges a conspiracy to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service by using a tax-exempt foundation, the National
Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty, to _ to generate funds
for the Contras.
   But would you just _ I can't figure it out what you want me to
do.
   Q. Put that recorder down in front.
   A. Who _ who? OK.
   Q. Can you tell us whether that's it now for the grand jury? Is
this _
   A. Oh, no. The grand jury is not finished.
   The grand jury is continuing.
   This is simply an interim report.
   They will be back again Monday.
   Q. So there may be other indictments?
   A. That will be for the grand jury to decide, what they want to
do.
   Q. Do you expect there will be other indictments?
   A. I can't comment on their investigation, and indeed, I can
comment even less after this indictment than I could before, which
was not very much.
   Q. Is there any reason why they would continue to sit, if not to
return indictments?
   A. Well, they have uncompleted investigations.
   I'm just talking in the abstract now, not saying what reasons
they might have.
   But I cannot discuss the grand jury's activities.
   Q. Judge, are you happy with the indictments that you got
against these four?
   A. I didn't hear you.
   Q. I'm sorry. Are you satisfied with the indictments _
   A. That's not for me to say.
   That's for the grand jury to say.
   Q. Is it as much as you proposed, or did you _
   Q. Thank you.
   Q. Thank you very much.
   A. Under the present circumstances, I can't do more than discuss
the indictments itself.
   I can no longer talk about background material.
   Q. Thank you very much.

<DATELINE>BASRA, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Badia Ghati'a al-Jabiri stood disconsolately
outside what was left of his downtown hotel after it was hit by a
Soviet-made Katyusha rocket fired by Iranian Revolutionary Guards a
few miles to the east.
   ``I'll need a fortune to get it repaired,'' he lamented as he
viewed the facade Tuesday. The front wall had collapsed into the
street. ``But thank God nobody was hurt.''
   Al-Jabiri's Ibn Kholdoun Hotel was empty because most people
have fled to safer areas out of reach of the relentless Iranian
bombardment.
   Basra, once Iraq's second-largest city, once again is taking a
hammering in the renewed ``war of the city'' between Iran and Iraq.
It has borne the brunt of the Iranian bombardment of border cities.
   Al-Jabiri is like many Basrans who are defying the Iranian
barrages and staying in their city after 7{ years of war.
   Shells and missiles hit the city day and night. The Iranians are
dug in a scant six miles east of the city that straddles the Shatt
Al-Arab waterway.
   It is formed by the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris
Rivers that forms the southern border between Iraq and Iran.
   Official statistics released this month in Baghdad showed that
Basra was hit by Iranian artillery and missiles 179 times last
year. Most of the 776 civilians listed as killed in Iraqi cities
last year died in Basra, the report said.
   Al-Jabiri lives with his wife, 10 children and his mother in the
Andalus district. He said they have no intention of leaving.
   ``Where would we go?'' he said. ``I was born in this city, my
kids have grown up here and know no other place. If we're going to
die, then let us die here.''
   In the latest round of missile, air and artillery attacks that
began Sunday after a short-lived cease-fire, officials said eight
civilians have been killed in Basra and 20 others wounded. The low
casualty rate was because most of the Basrans who are toughing it
out live in shelters or basements.
   But the city's governor, Anwar Omar Al-Hadithi told reporters
Basra that nearly 50 civilians have been killed and 250 wounded
since Feb. 29.
   In that period, he said, 164 houses, 49 shops and 150 vehicles
have been destroyed and 200 residences badly damaged.
   The Iranians have fired nearly 3,000 shells and 183 short-range
rockets into Basra in that time, he said.
   Despite the destruction, life goes on normally in several part
of the city, with shops, government offices and the university open.
   The barrage has hit mosques, schools and hospitals in the
ancient city, founded by Caliph Omer bin Al-Khatab in 637 A.D. and
reputedly the starting point for the legendary voyages of Sinbad
the Sailor.
   Some Basrans, especially those in the hardest-hit central
section of town, have sought shelter in nearby towns or in the
city's western outskirts.
   The authorities make no attempt to stop those who want to leave
but supply temporary pre-fabricated homes for anyone who wants one
on Basra's western edge.
   ``If they want to leave they can go anywhere they like,''
Al-Hadithi said at his heavily sandbagged headquarters. ``If they
want to stay they can stay.''
   Al-Hadithi estimated that 40 percent of the pre-war population
of more than 1.5 million has left the city in recent years, leaving
about 870,000 people.
   Many Basrans were caught by the latest round of shelling. They
had just returned to their homes believing that the cease-fire
would hold, but it lasted only two days.
   The renewed bombardment put many Basrans on the run again.
   ``We thought that the shelling had stopped so we went back
home,'' said Jassim Jabar Najim, 67. ``I even reopened my shop and
arranged to start business again when a shell hit near the shop and
I was hit in the hip by sharpnel.''
   Najim, interviewed from his bed in Basra's General Hospital,
said he has repaired his house four times, ``but this time I'm
going to leave it until the war is over.''
   As he spoke, shells exploded in the eastern part of the city.

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel is arresting Arab
activists like pharmacist Assad Saftawi, some of whom may have done
nothing illegal, in its effort to end three months of violence in
the occupied territories.
   Saftawi, 53, also is headmaster of a an elementary school run by
the United Nations in the Bureij refugee camp. He joined the
fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood as a youth in Egypt and later
spent four years in an Israeli jail for working with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Alaa, his 25-year-old son, said five Israeli soldiers took
Saftawi from the stone house on a dirt street of Gaza City's Sabra
district Sunday, adding him to a growing list of Palestinians being
held without trial for up to six months.
   Authorities use administrative detention as part of its effort
to break the rebellion, which Palestinians call ``the uprising,''
that began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The army reported 212 detentions up to Feb. 26. The Arab-run
human rights group Law In the Service of Man put the number at 232
through March 13, compared with 193 for all of 1987.
   ``It is used as an attempt to take out any potential leadership
the community might have,'' said Fatah Azzem, a member of the group
based in the West Bank town of Ramallah. ``It is a method of
punishment for people who are active and not necessarily illegally
active.''
   The army confirmed Saftawi was in administrative detention, but
a spokesman would not say what he had done or what threat he was
thought to pose.
   Saftawi, a squarely built man who favors the long Arab robe
called the djellaba, is an ardent nationalist who was severely
critical of occupation in an interview a few days before his arrest.
   As another son served glasses of tea and tiny blue cups of
strong, sweet coffee, Saftawi spoke with pride of his second son
Imad, a member of a fundamentalist organization. He has six sons
and three daughters.
   Imad, 24, became a local hero in Gaza after escaping from jail
and making his way abroad last year. Saftawi credits his his son
and Imad's friends with setting the stage for the rebellion.
   ``By their actions and their success they gave confidence to the
Palestinian people to depend on themselves, to be
self-sufficient,'' Saftawi said during the interview in his diwan,
or Arab-style reception room.
   He contrasted the confidence of youth to the passivity of those
who were adults when Israel captured the territories from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``We were deceived, believing that the Arabs or Islam or the
United Nations would do something for us,'' he said, ``but this
group made people believe we could depend on ourselves. They
planted the seed of something new.''
   The pharmacist and teacher was candid in criticizing the PLO,
which he said encouraged Palestinians to await deliverance from the
outside.
   ``There is no doubt that the PLO's original leadership belongs
to the older generation and was captive to old ideas, especially
the idea that we as Palestinian people were unable to do
anything,'' he said.
   His comments had an element of self-criticism because Saftawi,
by his own account, has been associated with the PLO for more than
three decades.
   In the early 1950s in Cairo, he was in the Moslem Brotherhood, a
fundamentalist group founded by Hassan al Banna in 1929. ``I
belonged to the only group at the time that was willng to make
sacrifices,'' Saftawi said.
   Egyptian authorities cracked down on the Brotherhood in 1955 so
Saftawi and fellow students like Yasser Arafat and Salah Khalaf,
now the top two PLO leaders, formed a new faction.
   Their group, the nucleus Arafat's future Fatah guerrillas, made
raids into Israel but Saftawi said he did not participate in them.
   Saftawi was arrested in 1973, six years after Israel took Gaza
from Egypt, and convicted of handling PLO funds. He spent four
years in jail.
   Imad was 9 at the time and took on responsibility for feeding
the family by working at odd jobs, Saftawi said.
   ``He became the breadwinner for the whole family and took care
of my parents,'' the father said. ``If I count the hours I saw my
son while I was in jail it was not more than 10.''
   Saftawi said Imad went to the Islamic University in Gaza City
and joined the Moslem Brotherhood, then formed his own group.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci was
monitoring events in Central America while in the Swiss capital for
meetings with his Soviet counterpart, aides say.
   Carlucci discussed Nicaragua in general terms with Soviet
Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov on Wednesday, said a Pentagon
spokesman, but it was not clear how deeply they delved into that
issue.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that
``regional issues were discussed .... Angola, Afghanistan,
Nicaragua, Korea.'' But he declined to disclose the substance of
the talks.
   Carlucci and Yazov met for 10 minutes with only their
translators present at the beginning of an afternoon session at the
Soviet Embassy, but the topic of that conversation remained secret.
   Aides to Carlucci worked through the night Wednesday and early
today, remaining in close contact with the Pentagon and White
House. They declined, however, to divulge the secretary's exact
role in the decision to send 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras for what
the White House called ``an emergency deployment readiness
exercise''

   Investigators are looking for a prime-time prowler
who slips into homes to take cash and jewelry while the residents
are watching television.
   At least 55 such burglaries have occurred since December in the
Denver area, police say.
   ``It's a little bizarre,'' Sgt. Pat Whitman of nearby Cherry
Hills Village said Wednesday. ``Most burglars would rather find an
empty house than a resident inside.''
   Denver Sgt. Bill Wiederspan says he's no psychiatrist, but he
has theories.
   ``Either it's psychological and he does it for the thrills. Or,
he's imitating burglars on TV shows and he's been watching too much
TV,'' he said.
   In as many as six houses a night, a prowler has entered, usually
through unlocked doors or windows, and fled with a few selected
items such as rifles, jewelry boxes, wallets or purses.
   The first possible confrontation with the prime-time prowler
occurred Monday night when a Cherry Hills resident came out of the
shower to find a stranger in his home.
   ``What are you doing here?'' the resident asked.
   ``Don't worry. I'm just leaving,'' said the tall, slender young
stranger, backing away and fleeing out a back door. A watch later
was discovered missing, authorities said.
   The intruder, whose visits last only a few minutes, is so neat
that many victims don't realize for some time that anyone has been
in the house. In a few instances, the homeowner has heard something
and the prowler has fled empty-handed.
   But authorities fear violence is not far away.
   ``I think it's just a matter of time,'' Wiederspan said.

   Reported incursions by Nicaraguan troops into
Honduras in pursuit of Contra rebels have marked the recent history
of the six-year Nicaraguan civil war, but the present U.S. reaction
is the strongest yet.
   The White House said Wednesday it was sending 3,200 American
infantry and airborne troops to Honduras today as ``an emergency
deployment readiness exercise.'' The White House says the action
was prompted by what it called the invasion of neighboring Honduras
by 1,500 to 2,000 Nicaraguan forces.
   The U.S. troops were to be kept 125 miles from the area of
reported hostilities, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The last such incident was late in November 1986. Honduras said
a Sandinista force of 2,500 soldiers crossed the border in a bid to
stall the Contras from mounting a dry-season offensive.
   Honduras, which claimed the Sandinistas had moved at least nine
miles deep into the country, responded by having U.S. helicopters
airlift about 3,000 Honduran troops to the area.
   There was some small-scale combat between the Sandinistas and
Hondurans. And the Hondurans bombed and strafed suspected
Sandinista positions with French-built Super Mystere and old,
U.S.-made A-37 jet fighters.
   Nicaragua denied that its troops crossed over, and no casualty
figures were released.
   In late March 1986, U.S. officials said about 1,500 Nicaraguan
troops were operating nine miles to 15 miles inside Honduras.
   The Sandinista government initially denied the charge, but
President Daniel Ortega acknowledged border crossings which he
claimed were ``totally defensive operations.''
   The week before that incursion, the House had voted 222-210
against President Reagan's request for $100 million in aid to the
Contras. The Senate approved the money four days after the
administration announced the incursion, and an aid package was
passed in August.
   At the time of the incursion, Reagan approved $20 million in
emergency assistance to the Hondurans, and U.S. helicopters ferried
about 600 Honduran soldiers to the area from the Palmerola air base
where the troops were being flown today.
   Honduran military sources said 200 Sandinistas were killed, 16
captured and others injured during the incursion, which lasted less
than a week. Forty Contras were reportedly killed.
   Other U.S. officials later scaled back their estimate of the
number of Sandinista troops involved in the border crossing to
about 800.

Suggests</HEAD>

   AIDS may force the growing populations of some
developing countries into decline decades after the first AIDS
virus infection, according to computer projections published today.
   But another study says that at the worst, AIDS could cut the
growth rate of a typical central African country in half.
   ``It's a disaster from any point of view,'' said John Bongaarts
of the Population Council in New York, who did the second study.
   Today's projections appear in the British journal Nature.
   They say that with low to moderate infection rates like those of
Kenya, Uganda or Zaire, population declines would not begin until
20 to 70 years after the AIDS virus invades a developing country,
even one with low growth rates.
   The researchers stressed that their projections are crude and
said too little is known about AIDS to make more realistic ones.
   ``It is clear that AIDS will have an impact on swelling
population growth rates, but by how much is too sensitive to things
we don't know about with sufficient certititude,'' said Robert May
of Princeton University, who did the study with Roy Anderson and
A.R. McLean of Imperial College in London.
   ``Any (firm) long-term projection about whether AIDS will or
will not bring about zero or even negative rates of growth in
Africa cannot be made.''
   In a telephone interview, May said the projections do not
pertain to the United States or any other developed country.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Africa is thought to
spread mainly through heterosexual contact, while most cases in the
United States stem from homosexual contact or needle sharing by
intravenous drug abusers.
   The researchers said they found potential for eventual
population decline under a range of plausible assumptions for such
factors as the fraction of infected people who will die from AIDS,
the fraction of infected women's babies who are born infected and
the length of time the virus lies dormant before causing AIDS.
   Projections are severely limited by lack of precise knowledge on
such points, May said.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control estimates that an
infected woman runs a 30 percent to 60 percent chance of giving
birth to an infected baby, and that 20 percent to 30 percent of
people infected with the virus develop AIDS within five years. The
CDC has no figure on the percentage of infected people who
eventually die from AIDS, a spokesman said.
   One series of projections in Nature assumed an initial 4 percent
growth rate like that of Kenya, where the population doubles about
every 16 years and residents have a normal life expectancy of 52
years.
   Assuming an eight-year dormant period for the virus, one
projection forecast eventual population decline if half or 30
percent of babies born to infected mothers are infected at birth.
   A second projection took the same basic assumptions, set the
infected-newborn rate at 50 percent, and found eventual population
decline if every infected person dies of AIDS.
   Bongaarts said his projections come out differently because he
divided the hypothetical population into groups of high, medium and
low risk for AIDS.
   He also said that ``very implausible estimates'' of the
prevalence of AIDS virus infection would be needed to project zero
population growth or population decline.
   His projections, in the worst case, find AIDS cutting the 3
percent growth rate typical of central African nations in half.
More likely is a reduction to 2 percent, he said.
   But even that implies a doubling of the death rate, leading to
an overwhelmed health care system and disrupted social structure,
he said.

<HEAD>Gene Discovery May Shed Light on Kidney Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists reported today they have found the
approximate location of a defective gene causing an inherited
tendency toward kidney cancer, and that the gene also may help
cause kidney cancer in general.
   Genes lie along threadlike structures called chromosomes. The
gene in the study is in a general area already associated with
genetic abnormality in kidney cancer, the researchers said.
   If the gene plays a role in kidney cancer, which strikes some
18,000 Americans a year, studying it may lead to better diagnosis
and treatment, another expert said.
   The gene is now linked to Von Hippel-Lindau disease, for which
only a few hundred cases are known in the United States, according
to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.
   Usually striking in young adulthood, the disease can cause
tumors in the eye, brain and spinal cord that can damage eyesight
and nerve function. About 40 percent of people with the disease
develop kidney cancer, usually in both kidneys, and their prognosis
is poor, researchers say.
   Genes are chemical sequences that lie along chromosomes in every
cell of the body.
   The U.S., Canadian, British and Dutch scientists, whose study is
reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature, used a
``marker,'' which is a chemical sequence at a known location on a
chromosome and can be inherited along with a gene if it is close
enough.
   In a study of 203 members of nine families, including 71 who had
Von Hippel-Lindau disease, the marker was inherited along with the
defective gene 90 percent of the time, said James Gusella of
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.
   Other studies have found that stretches of the chromosome
numbered 3 are missing in some kidney cancers. The new work shows
that the defective gene causing Von Hippel-Lindau disease resides
in the same general portion of the chromosome as the deletions,
researchers said.
   So the defective gene or a nearby one may play a role in at
least some sporadic kidney cancers, Gusella said.
   He explained that in its normal form, the gene may protect
against kidney cancer. Every cell gets two copies of a gene, so if
one copy is defective _ as in Von Hippel-Lindau disease _ the cell
has only one normal copy left. If that copy is damaged or deleted
during a person's lifetime, the cell could turn cancerous, Gusella
said.
   Under that theory, people without Von Hippel-Lindau disease
could get kidney cancer if both normal copies are damaged or
deleted during their lifetimes.
   The next step for researchers will be to find the gene and
isolate it for study.
   W. Marston Linehan of the National Cancer Institute, who has
studied chromosome deletions in kidney cancer, called the finding
very significant work that may help in learning about development
of kidney cancer.
   Such new understanding might lead to better diagnosis and
treatment, he said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Leonidas Macias, the alleged
leader of a failed coup, in recent months had been a staunch
defender of the nation's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   When President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried unsuccessfully to
remove Noriega as chief of the 15,000-member Defense Forces on Feb.
25, it was Macias who heatedly told reporters that Delvalle himself
would go before Noriega.
   Within hours, Delvalle was deposed by the Legislative Assembly
in a Noriega-orchestrated move.
   During the past year Macias, about 50, has been chief of police,
a job that put him in charge of about 5,000 officers and
administrative employees.
   They include the riot police, who have forcibly put down street
demonstrations against the government since last June.
   But after light arms fire broke out in the Defense Forces
headquarters on Wednesday, the military said that Macias, three
majors, a captain and some civilians were arrested after ``an
attempt by several officers to take over the headquarters of our
institution was foiled.''
   Panama's civil unrest began after accusations last summer that
Noriega was involved in crimes ranging from political assassination
to drug trafficking.
   Noriega was indicted on federal drug charges in Florida last
month.
   Some of those arrested in the anti-Noriega demonstrations have
accused Macias of allowing others to beat them while in custody.
One of those detained told the opposition-aligned Human Rights
Association that Macias took part in at least one beating. Macias
denied the accusations.
   Macias had conducted a public relations campaign with reporters
to counter the anti-Noriega drive, holding several news conferences
to report on events in the Defense Forces. He was the only
high-ranking officer to do so.
   In recent months, Macias called three news conferences, one
Christmas lunch and invited journalists to his home, always saying
in a jovial manner that nothing was happening.
   During a protest strike that began Feb. 29, Macias took
journalists around the city on a bus saying: ``Look, there's
nothing happening here. Everything is fine. Look at me, I'm
unarmed. What policeman like myself can move around the streets of
his city without being armed?''
   But he could be harsh with the opposition.
   On Feb. 29, he took Chamber of Commerce President Aurelio
Barria, who had been arrested a few hours earlier, before
reporters. ``Clown!'' he yelled at Barria. ``Look at him, he's
fine. You can go home!''
   Barria was detained for trying to enter the Chamber of Commerce
building, which had been closed by the government four days earlier.
   Although Macias was considered one of the colonels most loyal to
Noriega, there had been rumors before Wednesday that while they
kept up the appearance of good relations, there were problems
between the two men.

<HEAD>$3.5 Million In Matching Funds Certified By FEC For 11 Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission has certified
almost $3.5 million in new federal matching funds for 11
presidential candidates, including nearly $900,000 for Pat
Robertson whose Republican campaign is winding down.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis continued to lead the
Democratic money race, qualifying for more than $600,000 in new
matching funds and raising his matching total to more than twice
that of his competitors for his party's nomination.
   Dukakis' closest Democratic rivals Jesse Jackson and Tennesee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. qualify for a little more than $300,000 and
$336,000 respectively.
   Vice President George Bush, who has a big lead in the Republican
contest, got in line for a new quarter of a million dollars in
federal funds, keeping his edge in the category.
   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole is eligible for almost $390,000.
   In all, the new funds certified on Wednesday raise the total
certified thus far for 14 candidates to $45.44 million.
   Presidential candidates qualify for matching funds by raising at
least $5,000 in individual contributions of $250 or less in at
least 20 states. After qualifying, every individual contribution of
$250 or less is matched dollar-for-dollar by federal funds. The
money comes from the voluntary $1 checkoff on federal tax returns.

   Carl and Karen Hawkinson will be taking a
trip to New Orleans together this summer as delegates to the
Republican National Convention _ but that's where the togetherness
ends.
   The couple were elected Tuesday as GOP delegates, but he
supports Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and she backs Vice President George
Bush.
   ``We didn't really expect to both be elected but that's the way
it turned out,'' Hawkinson said.
   Even though Bush is the front-runner, Mrs. Hawkinson said
winning her delegate slot was a surprise because Dole was
considered the favorite in their congressional district.
   Her husband's win was not as as unpredictable, she said.
   ``Carl has held office since 1976 _ people are used to voting
for him,'' she said. ``But I had never been on a ballot before.''
   The two said campaigning for rival candidates made their home

   Gov. Mario Cuomo has signed legislation to
switch the date of the New York state primary to keep it from
falling on the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana.
   The primary, not to be confused with New York's April 19
presidential primary, will be held Thursday, Sept. 15. It was
originally scheduled two days earlier.
   Three other states had switched their primaries already to
prevent the conflict. Connecticut and Rhode Island will hold their
primaries Sept. 14, while Massachusetts will join New York with a
primary Sept. 15.
   Six states _ Arizona, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Utah, Vermont
and Wisconsin _ will hold primaries on Rosh Hashana, Sept. 13.
   In New York, Jews usually represent 20 percent or more of the
vote in Democratic primary contests.
   The state primaries which were swithced on Wednesday determine
nominations for governor, state legislative seats, Congress and
local offices.

<HEAD>Tearful North Vows To Fight Allegations: `I Will Never Give Up'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iran-Contra Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Col. Oliver North says he will fight the
criminal allegations against him ``for as long as necessary''
despite heavy personal and financial costs.
   ``I did not commit any crime,'' North said Wednesday a few hours
after a federal grand jury indicted him and three others on
conspiracy charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair. ``I intend
to fight allegations of wrongdoing for as long as necessary.''
   Appearing ashen-faced and grim, North said he was aware of the
high personal and financial costs of fighting the charges, but ``I
can assure you, I will never give up, we will win.''
   North thanked the American people ``who have shown so much love
and concern these past 16 months by their millions of telegrams and
letters and prayers and support.''
   The Marine officer said that he was caught in the cross-fire of
a bitter dispute between Congress and the president over Central
America, and that ``it is a shame the new battleground for such a
fight will be in a courtroom.''
   Beside North was his lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, who also
represented North at last summer's hearings before joint committees
of the Senate and House.
   Sullivan, whose spirited defense of his client was one of the
highlights of the hearings, said that seeking Wednesday's
indictment ``was one of the worst prosecutorial decisions in the
history of our country.''
   ``It is a decision of an unaccountable prosecutor who came to
Washington determined to allege that some crime, any crime had been
committed,'' Sullivan said.
   Sullivan added that Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel
``presents an indictment after 15 months (of investigation) based
on mistaken facts, novel and sometimes ridiculous legal theories.''
   ``Everyone must seriously wonder about a decision to indict a
man like Oliver North, a highly decorated Marine Corps officer,
based on his tireless effort in the interests of his country,''
Sullivan said.
   For his part, North said it was a sad irony that the decision to
indict should occur on the fourth anniversary of the abduction in
Lebanon of William Buckley and the third anniversary of the
kidnapping of Terry Anderson, The Associated Press' chief Middle
East correspondent.

   A firm of ex-commandos credited with
snatching a 7-year-old girl off a school bus in Jordan for her
American mother is known among law enforcement agencies for its
anti-terrorist training, officers say.
   Fayetteville Police Chief Ron Hansen said Corporate Training
Unlimited approached him last year and offered to train some of his
officers in such areas as building searches, response techniques
and hostage negotiations.
   ``It was excellent training,'' Hansen said Wednesday. ``I
checked them out and found out they were very reputable and
knowledgeable in their areas (of expertise).''
   ``They are extremely competent and detailed in what they do,''
said Hansen, whose 12-man emergency response team was trained by
CTU specialists at no cost.
   CTU's brochure touts the company as an ``International Security
Consulting and Training Firm specializing in both anti- and
counter-terrorist tactics and techniques.''
   ``Our staff is comprised entirely of Delta Force and Special
Operations qualified personnel, each with many years experience in
this field,'' it reads. ``These personnel have passed a rigorous
screening and selective process, participating in years of
specialized training and have proven themselves under fire.''
   Oscar Adkins, a CTU employee, is teaching a 40-hour course on
specialized weapons and tactics at Wilson County Technical College
in Wilson, N.C., according to school spokeswoman Mary Lou Smith,
   ``Representatives from the agency have also taught other courses
in the past,'' she said. ``They came highly recommended from other
law enforcement agencies.''
   Although CTU officials have denied involvement in the Jordan
mission, the company reportedly was paid up to $200,000 by Cathy
Phelps Mahone to recover her daughter, Lauren Bayan, from Jerash,
north of Amman, in late January.
   Ms. Mahone, who is said to be in hiding outside Dallas, claims
her ex-husband, Jordanian-born Mohammed Ali Bayan, failed to return
her daughter after a visit last October. A Dallas judge had given
Ms. Mahone custody after the couple's 1980 divorce, but Bayan
reportedly claims custody under Jordanian law.
   The rescue operation was planned and executed Jan. 28 by CTU,
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported last weekend, quoting anonymous
sources.
   CTU President Donald Feeney has denied involvement. A secretary
at the company's office told The Associated Press on Wednesday that
company officials would have no comment on the story.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said earlier this week
an American embassy officer in Amman has been recalled to
Washington to answer questions about his knowledge of the matter.
   Redman said the United States has apologized to Jordan for any
role the embassy officer may have played in the mission. The
officer, who was unidentified, had some prior knowledge of the plan
but apparently was misled by CTU, Redman said.
   In an interview last October, Guy Chapman, a former member of
the Army's secretive counter-terrorist unit Delta Force, said he
and three other former Delta members created the company in January
1986.
   ``A lot of companies profess to be knowledgeable, but when you
come right down to it, no company has the experience we have,'' he
said.
   In its brochure, CTU claims it offers courses to police agencies
or corporate security organizations in hostage rescue, shooting
enhancement, protective security, anti-terrorism and defensive
driving. The company also provides audio-visual training material
and professional guard services.
   Chapman, who says he participated in the abortive Iran hostage
rescue mission in 1979, said CTU has worked with federal and local
agencies protecting the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserves in
Louisiana and Texas.
   Chapman also said CTU has trained special police forces in Peru
and Ecuador, and worked with the South American offices of several
major U.S. companies, including Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson and
Johnson.
   Carla Mikell, a spokeswoman at Colgate-Palmolive, said Wednesday
that company officials would have no comment on the story. Johnson
and Johnson spokesman Jeff Leebaw said his company does not discuss
its security measures.

   Actress Brooke Shields and other
celebrities bussed tables and hawked their wares to raise money for
Dreammakers Inc., an organization that grants the wishes of
terminally ill children.
   Country musicians Lynn Anderson, Lee Greenwood and Charlie
Daniels joined local television news anchors and Shields to raise
an estimated $52,000 for the charity Wednesday.
   Gov. Ned McWherter and Mayor Bill Boner also joined in the Fifth
Annual Celebrity Waiters Luncheon.
   ``My dad would never let me wait tables when I was a teen-ager,
because he said it wasn't a good job for a lady,'' said Demetria
Kalidimos, an anchor at WSMV-TV. ``But, I think the money's pretty
good.''
   About 80 celebrities offered caps, posters and T-shirts
decorated with the Dreammakers logo to their fellows. Members of
the country music band Sawyer Brown bought Shields' apron for $500,
outbidding Davidson County Sheriff Fate Thomas and musician Chet
Atkins.
   The organization was created by Nancy West, who was presented
with the annual Dreammakers Award. She said the group's success
cannot be attributed to any one person.
   ``Let us not forget that this is the children who this is for
and I accept it on their behalf,'' she said.

   Here is a look at the latest major developments involving the
United States, Nicaragua and Honduras:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S. TROOPS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The White House said President Reagan ordered 3,200 U.S. troops
to begin an ``emergency deployment'' exercise in Honduras today in
response to the reported incursion of Nicaraguan forces into
Honduras. A spokesman described the troop movement as a training
exercise and ``a signal to the governments and the people of
Central America.''
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 1,500 to 2,000 Nicaraguan troops
were in Honduras after mounting an attack Contra rebel forces. He
said the U.S. troops were requested by Honduras' president. He did
not say how long they would stay in Central America.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONGRESS:
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd called the troop movement an
``overreaction.'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said ``I just hope it's
merited.'' A supporter of aid to the Contras, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., said he would ``reserve judgment'' on the wisdom of
Reagan's decision but added he believed the troops ``must not be
put into combat.''
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., appeared to support
the decision. And Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, said: ``I don't think
the president really had an alternative.''
   </HEAD>
<HEAD>NICARAGUA:
   President Daniel Ortega said Nicaraguan troops chased Contra
rebels into Honduran territory, and fighting raged along the
border, but would neither confirm nor deny whether Nicaraguan
soldiers crossed the border. Earlier, the Defense Ministry denied
its troops had entered Honduras.
   Ortega said Nicaragua's army began a major offensive against the
U.S.-supplied Contras March 6 and that 400 Contras had been killed
or wounded, 34 Sandinista soldiers had died and 68 were wounded.
   </HEAD>
<HEAD>HONDURAS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Military intelligence sources said late Wednesday that Honduran
troops surrounded about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers inside the
Honduran border province of Olancho. Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez
Contreras said President Jose Azcona Hoyo contacted Nicaraguan
President Ortega to demand the withdrawal of the Sandinista troops.
   Azcona met for six hours behind closed doors to discuss the
situation with top officials and the nation's armed forces chiefs.
Lopez Contreras said the military command was reviewing battle
plans in case the Sandinista forces remained in Honduran territory.

<TEXT>
   At least 90 members of a Moslem wedding
party died when their bus overturned and caught fire after the
driver lost control while changing a cassette in the tape player,
the United News of India said today.
   Most of the victims in Wednesday night's crash in central India
were women and children.
   The news agency said the bus was carrying about 105 people when
the accident happened near Simga village in Madhya Pradesh state,
560 miles southeast of the Indian capital.
   About 15 people, including the driver and the bridegroom,
escaped by breaking the windshield, UNI said. Blacksmiths from
Simga were trying to cut through the wreck today to recover bodies,
it added.
   The agency quoted ``reports received in New Delhi'' as saying
the driver lost control of the bus while changing a cassette in a
tape recorder. The bus swerved and smashed against a culvert with a
loud bang, UNI said.
   Some survivors said the bus caught fire because of an explosion
in the diesel tank, but others said passengers' firecrackers set
off the blaze.
   Ten injured people were taken to a hospital in Simga and were
reported out of danger.
   Authorities were investigating.

<TEXT>
   The developer of a proposed 358-mile Northeast
natural gas pipeline is vowing to find a more suitable place for
the project to cross the Appalachian Trail.
   Officials at Iroquois Gas Transmission System said Wednesday
they are confident of finding a new cross-over site that would
satisfy Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel, who rejected the
current plan.
   Hodel, in a letter to Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. R-Conn.
released Wednesday, said the current Iroquois pipeline plan would
cross the 2,000-mile Appalachian Trail at a point in New York near
the Connecticut border where it would have ``significant
environmental and scenic impacts.''
   ``The plan now is to find a place along the New York-Connecticut
border where we can cross,'' said company spokesman Gary B. Davis.
``We will have to sit down with the Park Service again and discuss
our concern. ... Something will have to be worked out.''
   The pipeline would have to cross the Appalachian Trail at some
point. The project would bring Canadian natural gas from Ontario
through New York and Connecticut to Long Island, serving New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut. The hiking trail runs from Maine to
Georgia.
   The $384 million project is the first and most prominent
Northeast gas line proposal under consideration by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.

   ``He is to singing what Frank Sinatra is to legislating,''
quipped White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, one of the

   The Arab American Institute has launched a
national campaign to put the issue of a Palestinian state directly

   ``Every state that has a convention or caucus process we will be

``And we will build a Middle East Peace Caucus in each convention

   Zogby explained that the campaign began as a trial program in
Iowa, Texas and California. In California the group intends to
introduce the resolution with petitions at the state's Democratic
convention this weekend.
   ``We chose the political system because we felt that's where
issues get debated and that's where one begins to influence the
shape and direction of policy in the '88 elections,'' he said.
   The three-year old institute, a planning and organizing center
for electoral strategies for the Arab-American community, already
has published a report on the presidential candidates' positions on
the Middle East.

   Officials hope to shore up the
reputation of Galveston beaches by shipping in tons of Florida
white sand to replace the native gritty brown variety.
   The developers of Moody Gardens on Offatts Bayou plan to use the
sand to create their own Palm Beach, including a 1,000-foot
boardwalk, two freshwater lagoons complete with a 12-foot waterfall
and white sand bottom, more than 100 palm trees, a tramway, jogging
trail and a covered eating and concession area.
   Moody Gardens Administrator Ralph McPheeters said the choice of
white sand over the hometown variety was easy. For years, people
have complained about Galveston's murky beach water and brown,
narrow beaches, he said.
   ``We can't do anything about the water but we sure can do
something about the sand,'' he said.
   Within the next two weeks, two ocean barges full of white sand
will arrive in Galveston from Orlando, where it was purchased from
sand mines, he said Tuesday.
   Developers looked for sand of a certain consistency since the
beach will have a 200-square-foot area specifically for sand castle
construction, McPheeters said.

   An ambulance attendant left his job
early to aid his pregnant wife and ended up delivering their baby.
   Mark Loken, 32, was working the night shift when he got a call
from his wife, Debbie, early Wednesday.
   She told him to come home because their baby, who was 11 days
overdue, was going to be born _ soon. When he arrived, the baby's
head was already starting to show.
   An ambulance arrived soon after, but it was obvious that this
baby was not going to wait for a trip to the hospital, so the
attendants left it up to Loken.
   They gave him the sterile gloves, and minutes later he delivered
his son, Scott Christian Loken.
   ``He did a good job,'' said Debbie Loken, 29, who was reported
doing well along with the baby at Luther Hospital.

   Writer Steve Roberts says he doesn't
feel tied down by the $75,000 piece of computerized equipment he
uses in his work. It's a bicycle, and he has pedaled 10,000 miles
across America.
   ``To me, the technology is liberating, not confining,'' the
35-year-old Roberts said Tuesday during a stop in Tallahassee.
   As he pedals his 8-foot-long recumbent bicycle, he captures
those catchy phrases that once vanished in the wind with the help
of four keys on each handlebar, a computer screen in front of him,
a program to translate his coded tappings into words and a radio
communications system.
   Someone asked if he had any idea of what he looked like on his
bicycle and a puzzled expression appeared on his face. His
traveling companion, Maggie Victor, chuckled.
   ``We look so absurd going down the highway that we really get
better treatment than most bicyclists. Our absurd look is really
our security system,'' she said.
   Roberts, from Columbus, Ohio, began his adventure when he had
his first custom bike built in 1983. ``Computing Across America,''
his book about his first 10,000 miles, was published recently.

<HEAD>Rare Dinosaur Embryo Discovery Supports Parenting Theory,
Scientist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists said today they have found embryo
skeletons from two kinds of dinosaurs in Montana, and that the
bones give further evidence that some dinosaurs may have tended
their young like birds.
   The discovery, some 60 miles southeast of Glacier National Park,
is reported in the British journal Nature.
   The animals lived some 75 million to 80 million years ago, John
R. Horner, curator of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies in
Bozeman, Mont., said in a telephone interview.
   Nineteen embryonic skeltons were found in a clutch of eggs laid
by a previously unnamed type of dinosaur, which Horner and David
Weishampel of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in
Baltimore propose calling Orodromeus makelai.
   That animal walked on its hind legs and grew perhaps eight feet
long. The embryos would be about eight or nine inches long when
stretched out, Horner said.
   Researchers also found parts of seven embryonic skeletons of the
duck-billed Maiasaura peeblesorum, which also walked walked on hind
legs and grew to be 30 feet long, he said. The embryos were about
one foot long, he said.
   Juvenile and adult specimens of each dinosaur were found with
the embryos.
   Horner said embryonic bones of the newly named dinosaur were
very well developed, while those of the duck-billed dinosaur had
not developed on the ends.
   That is consistent with the notion that hatchlings of the newly
named dinosaur could leave the nest soon after hatching, while
those of the other would have been bound to the nest, counting on
parents for care, Horner said.
   ``An animal that is nest-bound doesn't have to walk around''
right after birth, so its bones need not have developed as much by
that time, he said.
   Kevin Padian, associate professor of paleontology and biology at
the University of California, Berkeley, said the discovery was
``very important'' because few dinosaur embryos have been found.
   Last month, other researchers announced they had found a
dinosaur egg that may contain an embryo some 150 million years old.
Studies are continuing, but it does appear to contain an embryo,
said paleontologist Wade Miller of Brigham Young University in
Provo, Utah.

<TEXT>
   Former Nazi Deputy Fuehrer Rudolf
Hess was buried today in the family plot in this Bavarian town.
Concern about neo-Nazi demonstrations had blocked his interment
when he died last summer.
   Rainer Meier, a police spokesman in the nearby city of Hof, said
Hess was buried early this morning with only immediate family
members present. He did not name them and said he did not know from
where Hess' body had been brought.
   The Wunsiedel cemetery was temporarily sealed off and police
officers stood guard to prevent any disturances, Meier said in a
telephone interview. The Hof police headquarters also is in charge
of Wunsiedel, 30 miles to the south.
   Meier said that police had been informed of the burial well in
advance.
   Hess committed suicide in West Berlin's Spandau prison Aug. 17
at age 93 by hanging himself. He was the last imprisoned leader of
Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. After his death, dozens of neo-Nazis
converged on Wunsiedel in far northeastern Bavaria to show their
support for the dead Nazi.
   That prompted the Hess family to move the body to an undisclosed
location until the public interest declined.

   The defeats of extremist Lyndon LaRouche and his
followers in the Illinois primary show the state Democratic party
learned a lesson two years ago and passed it on to voters, party
officials say.
   ``The nation became aware of what happened in Illinois in 1986,
and I think we have pretty well put that to rest,'' said George
Sangmeister, who won his Democratic congressional primary Tuesday
over a LaRouche-backed opponent, George M. Laurence of Romeoville.
   No one answered the telephone at Laurence's home or at LaRouche
headquarters late Wednesday to comment on the primary results.
   Sangmeister, of Mokena, was one of two party-endorsed candidates
who went down in a surprising defeat to LaRouche supporters in
1986, sending shock waves throughout the state Democratic party.
   Mark Fairchild defeated Sangmeister for the Democratic
nomination for lieutenant governor that year. Another LaRouche
disciple, Janice Hart, beat party candidate Aurelia Pucinski for
the nomination for secretary of state.
   The party's state central committee declared the nominations
void, and neither LaRouche candidate won office.
   This year, despite Democratic court challenges, LaRouche and
more than 20 of his supporters were on Tuesday's primary ballot for
offices from president to county recorder of deeds. Democrats
countered with a mail campaign.
   Ms. Pucinski defeated Mrs. Hart in the Democratic primary race
for Cook County Circuit Court clerk, and Sangmeister easily
defeated Laurence for the congressional nomination.
   Unofficial vote totals gave Sangmeister 26,979 votes to
Laurence's 7,518. In the clerk's race, Ms. Pucinski had 283,504,
former Mayor Jane Byrne had 199,306 and Ms. Hart had 12,530 for 2
percent of the vote.
   LaRouche got 6,036 votes in the presidential primary, according
to unofficial totals _ not even 1 percent.
   Two years ago, the Fairchild victory caused Adlai E. Stevenson
to give up his Democratic nomination for governor, saying he would
not run with a LaRouche extremist. Stevenson, calling LaRouche's
views ``neo-Nazi,'' then formed the Illinois Solidarity Party but
subsequently lost to the incumbent, Republican Gov. James R.
Thompson.
   LaRouche, whose headquarters are in Leesburg, Va., is seeking
the Democratic nomination on a platform that includes quarantining
AIDS patients and populating Mars.
   LaRouche is on trial in Boston on federal fraud and conspiracy
charges.
   ``The party and I decided we were not going to afford these and
other fringe candidates the opportunity to have a refuge here,''
declared Vince Demuzio, who became state party chairman after the
LaRouche victories.
   The LaRouche forces did win an upset this month in Houston, when
Claude Jones was elected Harris County Democratic Party chairman in
the Texas primary on March 8.

<HEAD>De Mita Says He'll Form Same Five-Party Coalition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier-designate Ciriaco De Mita said he will form
Italy's 48th postwar government with a coalition of the same five
parties that have governed the country for most of the past eight
years.
   De Mita, leader of the dominant Christian Democrats, was
appointed to the temporary post Wednesday by President Francesco
Cossiga.
   Premier Giovanni Goria, also a Christian Democrat, resigned last
Friday after heading a shaky five-party coalition for 7{ months.
   The 60-year-old De Mita said he would begin negotiations Friday
with political leaders to form a stronger coalition of the
Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and
Liberals. The five parties have governed together off and on since
1981.
   ``I know that the task that I am about to take up is difficult,
laborious and complex,'' De Mita said. ``There are many questions
we have to face, and to confront them we need political stability
and clear accords.''
   Once De Mita obtains the party leaders' pledges of support, the
next step is informing Cosiga and Parliament, where he must win
approval to become premier. De Mita cannot succeed without support
of the Socialists, the No. 2 party in the coalition.
   Socialist leader and former premier Bettino Craxi said Wednesday
he was not opposed to the appointment of De Mita, with whom he has
often feuded, but that his final support would depend on government
policy.
   Among the divisive issues facing De Mita is Italy's nuclear
policy. The government's decision last week to resume construction
of a nuclear power plant near Rome angered the Socialists and
helped force Goria to resign.
   Also in dispute are the fate of the secret vote in Parliament
and proposals for including the tiny Radical and Green parties in
the coalition.
   De Mita was elected in 1982 as secretary of the Christian
Democrats, a post many consider the most powerful political
position in Italy. If he is confirmed as premier, he will keep the
position until the party's congress later this year.
   De Mita, son of a tailor, was born in Nusco, a small hill town
near Naples. He entered politics in the 1950s after earning a law
degree. He was elected to Parliament in 1963 and has held his seat
since then, serving as a minister in several governments in the
1970s.

   Under pressure from several Dakota Indians
and Indian organizations, the Minnesota Historical Society has
apologized for displaying the remains of Dakota Chief Little Crow.
   The apology Wednesday did not mention Little Crow by name, but
expressed ``deep regret for the pain and anguish that the society's
past actions have caused the Indian people.'
   Little Crow was killed in the summer of 1863, a year after he
led the Dakota, or Sioux, tribes in the great Dakota Confict of
1862. The conflict came close to depopulating the Minnesota
frontier and ended with the hanging of 38 Dakota braves the day
after Christmas in the largest mass execution in U.S. history.
   Little Crow was shot and killed by a farmer near Hutchinson,
Minn., while picking raspberries.
   The historical society put Little Crow's remains on display from
1879 to 1915 and kept the remains until 1971, when they were turned
over to family members in Flandreau, S.D., for burial.
   A preamble to the resolution approved Wednesday said, ``Judged
by society's standards today the exhibition of human remains and
the treatment of them as museum artifacts is unthinkable.''
   The resolution did not satisfy two of Little Crow's relatives,
who angrily confronted executive director Nina Archabal after the
resolution was passed, and threatened to go to ``higher ups'' to
get a more specific apology.
   Lee Ann Tall Bear, a direct descendant of Little Crow, said she
was ``really sorry that our family business had to be put on public
display.''
   ``The disposition of an ancestor was something that was done
privately ... I do want to ask one thing; that you let this go,
that we stop being put on display and treated like performing
monkeys.''

<HEAD>Soviets Launch First Satellite For A Paying Customer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said it launched its first
satellite for a paying customer today, lifting the Indian-owned
payload into orbit from the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.
   The satellite was launched at 9:40 a.m. form the Baikonur
spaceport, said Nikolai Semyonov, an official in the international
liaison office of the Glavkosmos space agency.
   He said the launch was the first on commercial terms with a
foreign country or company, adding that negotiations were under way
for similar deals although no contracts have been signed yet.
   In New Delhi, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced the
successful launch to a cheering Parliament. He called it ``a major
milestone'' in India's space program and said India was the fifth
nation to have a remote sensing satellite. The others are The
United States, Soviet Union, France and Japan.
   The satellite, called IRS, will operate for three years studying
India's forests, water resources and mineral deposits using remote
sensing devices, Radio Moscow said.
   The Soviets created Glavkosmos in January 1986 to seek foreign
customers for its launching services.
   Commercial satellite launching is also offered by the United
States, China and the European consortium Ariane. But the U.S.
space shuttle, meant to be the workhorse for satellite launches, is
still grounded because of the January 1986 explosion of Space
Shuttle Challenger. The Ariane program also has suffered setbacks.
   The Soviets sent the first satellite into space, in 1957, and
have the advantage of the most experience in satellite launching,
sending aloft more spacecraft than any other country. The Soviets'
powerful booster rockets can also put into orbit heavier payloads
than their Western competitors.
   Yuri N. Salekov, deputy director of Licensintorg, which works
with Glavkosmos and other Soviet foreign trade organizations,
declined to say how much the launching cost on the grounds it is a
``commercial secret.''
   Semyonov, in a telephone interview, said IRS was launched aboard
a Vostok rocket booster and that the satellite reached orbit
without problem.
   The flight was controlled by a Soviet monitoring station near
Moscow and the Indian space control center in Bangolore, Tass said.
   Glavkosmos officials repeatedly complain that their efforts to
seek Western buyers for Soviet satellite-launching services are
severely hampered by Western governments' restrictions on the flow
of technology. The United States and other countries fear the
Soviets will steal Western technology used in satellites.

   An Afghan court sentenced an Italian journalist to
seven years in prison after convicting him of spying while
accompanying anti-government guerrillas, the official Soviet news
agency Tass reported.
   Fausto Balezlavo of Trieste entered Afghanistan illegally in
July and followed Ahmad Shahom, one of the guerrilla leaders
fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government, Tass said.
   Balezlavo was a social sciences student at a university in
Trieste, Tass said in a report Wednesday. It did not say when he
was convicted, but indicated Balezlavo was sentenced Wednesday in
Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   It also did not say whether Balezlavo challenged the charges or
for whom he was accused of spying. Tass also did not say for whom
Balezlavo was working.
   The Afghan rebels are supported by Pakistan and the United
States.
   Balezlavo is the second European journalist to be convicted of
spying in Afghanistan.
   Alain Guillo, a French freelance filmmaker, was convicted Jan. 4
of spying while accompanying guerrillas. He was sentenced to 10
years in prison.
   Two Americans were killed last year while making a documentary
film in Afghanistan.
   Western correspondents are not allowed into Afghanistan except
on government-arranged trips.
   The seven main Afghan guerrilla groups, based in Pakistan,
routinely take Western journalists into Afghanistan illegally to
report on the fighting against government troops supported by an
estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers.

   Even as George Bush savors his apparently
insurmountable lead in the race for the Republican presidential
nomination, the Iran-Contra affair is re-emerging as a grim
political liability.
   Bush had no immediate reaction to Wednesday's indictment of two
former White House officials _ Oliver L. North and John M.
Poindexter _ on charges stemming from the arms-to-Iran initiative.
   But Pete Teeley, his chief spokesman, said, ``They weren't
unexpected.'' And he said that ``what is going on with those four
gentlemen has nothing to do with this campaign.''
   Teeley insisted that the specter of indictments of former Reagan
administration figures had nothing to do with Bush's statement last
week that ``I am tired of being embarrassed'' by accounts of
unethical behavior by high government officials.
   That may be so, but a federal grand jury and a special
prosecutor have managed what presidential rival Bob Dole had been
unable to do _ keep the Iran-Contra furor in the public view.
   The Kansas senator had hoped to raise sufficient questions about
Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair to sow doubts in the minds of
Republicans about Bush's electability against a Democrat in
November.
   In the wake of the indictments of North and Poindexter, along
with arms merchants Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, Bush may be
thinking of Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s tart warning of Jan. 8.
   ``If you can't answer your friends, what in heaven's name is
going to happen next November if you are our standardbearer and
these Democrats get after you on this subject?'' Haig asked Bush.
   In fact, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a Democratic
presidential candidate, said Wednesday, ``This will be an important
issue in the campaign, regardless of whether new evidence is
revealed to further implicate the vice president.''
   ``George Bush has already pleaded guilty to exercising bad
judgment in what turned out to be the biggest American foreign
policy debacle in decades,'' he said.
   To a certain degree, Bush has answered questions about his role
in the affair, although he has declined to spell out what
reservations he had. But he must cope with some lingering questions:
   _Does he still consider Lt. Col. North ``a national hero''
despite the ``mistakes'' that North made?
   _Was it appropriate for him to invite both North and Vice Adm.
Poindexter to a Christmas party at his house on the grounds of the
Naval Observatory, even after both had been ousted by Reagan?
   _Does he still retain confidence in his national security aide,
Donald Gregg, a former CIA agent whose name has cropped up in
various reports linking him to North's behind-the-scenes efforts to
manage the Contra war against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua?
   Gregg has been associated with Felix Rodriguez, another onetime
CIA operative, who had been involved in helping to run the secret
resupply operation for the Contras.
   _How does he resolve the seeming contradiction between his
statements that he only became fully aware of the arms-for-hostages
nature of the dealings with Iran late in 1986, and statements by
chief of staff Craig Fuller indicating that Amiram Nir, an Israeli
counter-terrorism expert, had briefed Bush on this aspect of the
initiative in May 1986?
   ``I was told what they were doing, not what we were doing,''
Bush subsequently said.
   _Can he explain failing to recall the strenuous objections that
Secretary of State George Shultz and then-Defense Secretary Caspar
W. Weinberger raised about the arms sales? Shultz told
congressional investigators he became ``apoplectic'' when he
learned about it.
   Bush told reporters in Adel, Iowa, on Jan. 9 that he would be
willing to make public his notes and documents on the Iran-Contra
affair, saying ``it doesn't bother me'' to declassify some papers.
   Bush's reservations reportedly involved his concern, as a
onetime CIA director, over the possibility the United States was
allowing Israel to play too great a role a super-sensitive covert
operation.
   Reagan has corroborated Bush's statement that the vice president
voiced reservations about the deal, but neither has said what those
reservations were.
   Bush has acknowledged repeatedly that ``mistakes were made'' in
the arms-to-Iran initiative and the subsequent diversion to the
Nicaraguan rebels of the proceeds from the sales of anti-aircraft
and anti-tank missiles. But he also has said that ``I was aware of
the Iran initiative and I support the president's decision.''
   Bush has said he never knew about the diversion of profits, and
the congressional investigative committees produced no evidence to
contradict him on that.
   ``I wish it hadn't happened,'' he said on Dec. 19, 1986.

   At least 90 members of a Moslem wedding
party died when their bus overturned and caught fire after the
driver lost control while changing a cassette in the tape player,
the United News of India said today.
   Most of the victims in Wednesday night's crash in central India
were women and children.
   The news agency said the bus was carrying about 105 people when
the accident happened near Simga village in Madhya Pradesh state,
560 miles southeast of the Indian capital.
   About 15 people, including the driver and the bridegroom,
escaped by breaking the windshield, UNI said. Blacksmiths from
Simga were trying to cut through the wreck today to recover bodies,
it added.
   The agency quoted ``reports received in New Delhi'' as saying
the driver lost control of the bus while changing a cassette in a
tape recorder. The bus swerved and smashed against a culvert with a
loud bang, UNI said.
   Some survivors said the bus caught fire because of an explosion
in the diesel tank, but others said passengers' firecrackers set
off the blaze.
   Ten injured people were taken to a hospital in Simga and were
reported out of danger.
   Authorities were investigating.

   President Oscar Arias called the
reported Sandinista incursion into Honduras deplorable, saying it
jeopardizes truce talks set for Monday between the Nicaraguan
government and Contra rebels.
   A Contra spokesman said the talks would be suspended unless
Sandinistas halt the offensive against Contra forces in northern
Nicaragua.
   ``Being certain that the Nicaraguan army invaded Honduras, my
government condemns it categorically and with firmness,'' Arias
said Wednesday night.
   ``I deplore that this happens shortly before the meeting begins,
and it appears to me lamentable because Costa Rica feels that the
manner of resolving problems is through direct dialogue and not
through war,'' he told a news conference in San Jose.
   The cease-fire talks were scheduled to take place in the town of
Sapoa, near Nicaragua's border with Costa Rica. Arias won last
year's Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the regional peace plan
under which they are taking place.
   Carlos Hurtado, an adviser to the Nicaraguan Resistance, the
Contra umbrella organization, told The Associated Press the talks
would be suspended if the offensive continued.
   ``If the Sandinistas pursue this offensive with the intention of
destroying our forces, it is possible that the Sapoa reunion will
be suspended,'' Hurtado said.
   Arias said he had spoken by telephone Wednesday with Presidents
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and Jose
Azcona Hoyo of Honduras about the situation.
   Ortega has said Sandinista troops pushed 2,000 Contras into
Honduras, but has not confirmed that troops entered the neighboring
country.
   ``After it cost us so much to have convened a reunion in Sapoa .
.. (Nicaragua) resorts to military action a few days before
realizing (the talks) with the proposition of coming to the
negotiating table with a better position,'' Arias said.
   ``We are putting in danger the much or the little that we have
achieved in the Central American peace process and the eyes of the
world are placed on the isthmus to find out what we are capable
of,'' he added.
   The peace plan calls for cease-fires in El Salvador, Guatemala
and Nicaragua, an end to outside support for the area's
insurgencies, and negotiations aimed at installing democratic
governments, among other points.
   The plan was signed by Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Costa Rica.

   Amnesty International today accused Panama's
security forces of torturing and killing people who staged peaceful
protests against the rule of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In a 15-page report, the international human rights group said
more than 1,000 people have been injured in protests since last
June, when widespread opposition to Noriega began.
   Demonstrations in the Central American country started after a
former aide of Noriega accused the general of corruption, election
fraud and the 1985 assassination of a political foe.
   Panamanians turned into the streets last summer to demand
Noriega's resignation as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces.
Noriega is considered the real power behind Panama's civilian
government.
   Amnesty said hundreds of people, including scores of children,
had been detained for sounding car horns, raising their right arm
or waving white handkerchiefs _ all symbols of protest in Panama.
   The report deals with rights violations in the country from June
through January. Since then, demonstrations against Noriega have
intensified, including rioting in the two largest cities Wednesday
after a coup was aborted.
   The report said the Defense Forces ``have used excessive force
when responding to apparently non-violent opposition to current
government policies.''
   It said witnesses reported that police shot and killed Eduardo
Enrique Carrera, 24, after he shouted ``Down with Noriega'' at a
rally last July 26.
   The report said said 54 former detainees and other sources had
described ``a pattern of brutality by the security forces before,
during and after demonstrations.''
   Noriega was indicted in Florida last month on federal drug
trafficking charges. The United States has imposed economic
sanctions to force Noriega's resignation that have left the
government unable to pay public employees.
   Amnesty said troops have harassed, beaten and arbitrarily
detained opposition leaders and that scores of demonstrators have
been stripped, starved and tortured in crowded and filthy prisons.
   Armed paramilitary squads were reported to have shot and killed
several protesters and attempted to provoke violence during
demonstrations while government soldiers stood by, but the
incidents could not be independently verified, the London-based
group said.
   Witnesses have identified members of these squads as prominent
members of the ruling party or security force personnel in civilian
clothes, it said.
   Amnesty said its findings were sent to Noriega in December but
it has received no response.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung stepped
down today in a last ditch attempt to reunite South Korea's
bitterly divided opposition parties before legislative elections
next month.
   In a separate development, President Roh Tae-woo ordered the
military to stay out of politics and concentrate on defending the
nation. The former army general, who was elected president last
December, said the military's role should be in keeping with
democratic reforms under way in South Korea.
   Kim resigned as leader of the Party for Peace and Democracy and
appealed to the rival Democratic Reunification Party to agree to an
immediate merger.
   ``I have made up my mind to resign in the belief that everything
must be done to ensure we do not miss the last chance for the
merger which is our supreme task,'' the veteran leader said in a
statement.
   Kim Dae-jung and his supporters seceded from the Democratic
Reunification Party after the two Kims both insisted on running in
the Dec. 16 presidential election.
   They split the opposition vote and lost to government candidate
Roh, who took power Feb. 25.
   Kim's resignation was announced at a news conference by party
officials and he was reported to be in seclusion. The Party for
Peace and Democracy said Kim was not feeling well.
   It was not clear if his resignation would clear the way for
reunification. The rival Democratic Reunification Party discussed
the resignation at a meeting and announced plans for a second
meeting Friday to consider merging with the Party for Peace and
Democracy.
   But some Democratic Reunification Party officials privately
expressed distrust and said they feared the resignation was a
trick. Some political observers were reluctant to accept Kim was
bowing out of politics.
   ``We are skeptical in view of Kim Dae-jung's duplicity in the
past,'' said a Democratic Reunification Party official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Park Young-sook, a Party for Peace and Democracy vice president
who read Kim's statement, became acting party president. She
declined to answer questions about what would happen if the
opposition merger fails. She expressed hope the opposition would
unite by Sunday.
   Kim has been a major figure in politics for 30 years. He helped
spearhead opposition to the country's successive authoritarian
governments and gained international standing as a dissident and
human rights activist.
   The departure of Kim Dae-jung follows the resignation last month
of rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam.
   Officials of the Party for Peace and Democracy said they could
not comment on Kim Dae-jung's future political plans. In his
statement, Kim said he would work for an opposition victory in
National Assembly elections expected to be held April 26.
   Merger talks between the two parties collapsed last week after
the Democratic Reunification Party demanded Kim Dae-jung's
resignation.
   Roh was briefed today on the Defense Ministry's policies for the
year.
   ``No one should try to use the military for political purposes,
and the military itself should remain guarded against being used
politically,'' Roh said.
   South Korea has been plagued by military involvement in politics
since 1960 when the late President Park Chung-hee, then an army
general, staged a coup. Roh was one of the generals who helped
ex-President Chun Doo-hwan seize power with military backing in
1980.

   A brother of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat died
today in a Cairo hospital after a long bout with liver cancer, a
third Arafat brother said.
   Mustafa Arafat, 62, died at the Palestinian Red Crescent
Hospital, said Fat'hy Arafat, who is the hospital's director.
   Mustafa Arafat, who was manager of the Palestine Automobile Club
in Cairo, is survived by his wife. His funeral will be held in
Cairo on Friday.
   Both Fat'hy Arafat and spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman at Palestine
Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis said they did not
know whether the 57-year-old PLO leader will attend the funeral.
   Mustafa Arafat was born in Jerusalem and went to school there
and in Cairo. He was in private business until the early 1960s,
when he joined Fatah, the largest of eight factions that make up
the PLO.
   Yasser Arafat founded Fatah and officially launched it in 1965.
   The Arafat brothers also have a sister living in Cairo. She is
known by her code-name Um al-Mumeneen, or ``Mother of the
Faithful.''

   Sirens wailed and hundreds of boisterous
fans jammed the street to cheer Susan Butcher as she coasted to an
unprecedented third straight victory in the 1,150-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Bitterly cold winds raked Nome as the flushed and perspiring
33-year-old Alaskan cruised beneath the log-arch finish at 8:42
p.m. Wednesday.
   ``It means a lot to me to win three years in a row,'' said a
smiling Butcher, the only musher to win three consecutive
Iditarods, as she hugged her frosty-faced lead dogs, Granite and
Tolstoy.
   ``I very much want four,'' said Butcher, who has competed in 11
of the grueling races and earned $30,000 for Wednesday's victory.
``I guess I want five.''
   Although the weather ``was pretty nasty,'' Butcher said this
morning, it was to her advantage ``because my dogs are good in that
type of conditions.''
   Butcher, who appeared with Granite on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' said the dog ``came through with flying colors. He's got
to get a good bone for this one.''
   Butcher finished after 11 days, 11 hours, and 41 minutes, a
record for the race's longer northern route from Anchorage to Nome.
Last year, her time of 11 days, 2 hours set a record for the
shorter southern route.
   Her closest rival, Martin Buser of Big Lake, trailed by 14 hours
Wednesday night.
   ``What gave me the jump on Martin was that storm we had last
night,'' Butcher said. ``I knew, when I heard we were going to have
winds, that was the best thing that could happen, because I knew
mine would pull through it.''
   Buser's team, she said, had balked in light winds earlier along
the coast. ``So I knew he couldn't make it through a storm,'' she
said. Wind and cold dropped the wind chill to minus 70 degrees.
   She said Buser, battling for second place with four-time
Iditarod champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, will be a strong
contender if he races next year.
   Joe Garnie of Teller was running fourth Wednesday. Joe
Redington, a 70-year-old Knik resident known as ``the father of the
Iditarod'' for helping in 1973 to found the race he has never won,
was fifth.
   After the winner's take, the next 19 finishers will split
$120,000 in prize money.
   People emptied out of bars and at least one church as Butcher
headed into this old gold-mining town, a regional hub for western
Alaska whose population roughly doubled in recent days because of
the race.
   Butcher has won the Iditarod three times, finished second twice,
and finished among the top 10 four other times. She is the second
woman to win the Iditarod. Libby Riddles of Teller won the contest
in 1985, the year Butcher was forced to drop out after an angry
moose stomped through her team.
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior Alaska, draws its inspiration from a 1925
relay of diphtheria serum to Nome, which was hit hard by an
outbreak of the disease.
   The race started March 5 on trucked-in snow in downtown
Anchorage, and the temperature fluctuated around freezing the next
few days, which strained the cold-loving huskies. Then, fresh snow
slowed the leaders in the Alaska Range.
   Redington, who has entered all but two of the race's 16
runnings, has placed as high as fifth. For 400 miles, it seemed as
if he might finally win, but he lost the lead to Buser on the
frozen Yukon River.
   As the race reached the windblown Bering Sea coast, Butcher
quickly caught up. She passed Buser on Tuesday near Koyuk, 171
miles from the finish.
   Five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out. The
remaining teams were strung 500 miles back along the trail and will
be straggling into Nome for a week or more.

   Art students will have to stretch their
imaginations in life-drawing class now that a county official has
banned nude models.
   Bob Ash, head of the Cobb County Community Services Department,
who a few weeks ago asked that models wear bathing suits, leotards
or ``just basically anything,'' because of fear about how nude
modeling might be perceived.
   ``The community might react in a negative way,'' Ash said.
   ``My students don't understand,'' said Stephen Smith, an Atlanta
artist who has taught life drawing and life sculpting courses at
the county-run Steeple House Arts Center since shortly after its
January 1987 opening. Nude models had been used only in Smith's
advanced, adults-only art classes.
   The issue of nudity in art will be addressed tonight by the
county's five-member Arts Commission. Ash has said he will abide by
the commission's decision, though he may disagree with it.
   ``I am surprised that it would become an issue in this day and
time,'' said Carolyn Duncan, director of the Marietta-Cobb Fine
Arts Center, which is funded in part by Cobb County but not bound
by Ash's decision. The Steeple House is fully funded by the county.
   Cobb Arts Commissioner Pat Wayman said prohibiting the study of
nudes in art ``would take us back 300 years.'' She said the fact
that a piece features a nude figure does not mean it is
pornographic.

   Six Israeli fighter-bombers blasted
Palestinian guerrilla bases in Druse-held territory above Beirut
today in the deepest air raid into Lebanon this year, police said.
   They said one guerrilla was killed and two other people, a
fighter and his 2-year-old son, were wounded in the attack, the
third against Palestinian targets in Lebanon since January.
   The jets dropped four shells on one base in the Aynab village,
demolishing a building used as a base for the Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine.
   The Marxist front is one of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's eight main factions.
   Palls of black smoke billowed from the stricken target and other
bases hit in Chemlan, Bayssour and Kabr Shmoun, streching 10 to 15
miles southeast of Beirut and overlooking Beirut International
Airport.
   Police said incoming and outgoing traffic at the airport was
suspended for 15 minutes as a precaution.
   It was the first time this year that Israeli jets hit targets
that close to Beirut. The sound of explosions could be heard across
the city as the jets criss-crossed the skies, drawing anti-aircraft
fire from guerrilla positions.
   Police said the planes released air balloons to deflect
heat-seeking, shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles unleashed by
guerrillas. No planes were hit.
   In a brief statement, the Israeli army command acknowledged the
raid and said the targets had ``served as bases for planning and
launching attacks against Israel.''
   ``All our planes returned safely and the pilots reported the
destruction of the targets,'' the Israeli statement said.
   The raid was launched one day after guerrillas in south Lebanon
fired Soviet-made Katyusha rockets into northern Israel. The attack
shattered windows and damaged citrus trees, but caused no
casualties, according to Israeli reports.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command and the Fatah-Uprising, both at odds with PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat, also have bases in the stricken villages.
   Despite their own differences, the Syrian-backed factions and
Arafat's loyalists are allied with Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt in
Lebanon's nearly 13-year-old civil war.
   Israeli warplanes raided targets near Sidon, 25 miles south of
Beirut on Jan. 2 and on March 12.
   Twenty-one people were killed and 30 wounded in the first
attack, and four were killed and 10 wounded in the second, by
Lebanese police count.

<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court judge today
granted a four-week stay of execution for the ``Sharpeville Six,''
blacks whose scheduled hangings Friday prompted a massive
international clemency campaign.
   Shortly before the court hearing began, a car bomb exploded
outside a courthouse and police station 25 miles away in
Krugersdorp. The blast killed three black men, one of them a
policeman, and injured 16 people.
   Black leaders had warned the hangings might provoke violence,
although there was no immediate evidence linking the blast to the
Sharpeville case.
   Justice W.J. Human, who sentenced the five men and one woman to
death three years ago, said there was evidence that a key
prosecution witness had perjured himself during the trial.
   Scores of people in the courtroom, almost all black, burst into
applause when Human announced his decision. Several hundred more
people on the steps outside cheered, raised clenched fists and sang
freedom songs when they heard the news.
   The six were convicted of complicity in the 1984 mob murder of a
black town councilor during anti-apartheid riots, even though there
was no direct evidence they directly contributed to the victim's
death. Government leaders, churches and human rights groups around
the world appealed for clemency.
   The judge based his decision on a defense application
questioning the reliability of testimony by prosecution witness
Joseph Manete. Human cited a May 11, 1985 statement in which Manete
said he had been forced by police to identify two of the accused as
having been at the scene.
   Human said he was never made aware of that statement and,
therefore, did not allow the defense to cross-examine Manete on
that point.
   ``If Manete's statement had been available I would have allowed
cross-examination,'' Human said.
   He granted the defense until April 18 to prepare an application
for a retrial for all six defendants.
   President P.W. Botha told black Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu
in a meeting Wednesday night he would not intervene in the case. He
said the only way the six could be reprieved was if Human ruled
there was significant new evidence.
   Tutu was outside Pretoria Supreme Court today with relatives of
the convicted.
   Both the trial court and the appeal court found no evidence that
the Sharpeville Six committed the murder.
   They were convicted in a non-jury trial by white judges under
the doctrine of ``common cause,'' which holds they were responsible
for the Sept. 3, 1984 death of Sharpeville deputy Mayor Jacob
Dlamini because they were found to be part of a mob of 100 people
who stoned and burned him to death.
   In Durban and Cape Town, protesters demonstrated at U.S. and
British diplomatic missions, urging stronger pressure by those
countries to avert the hangings.
   Cape Town police arrested 21 white women from the Black Sash
civil rights group who were demonstrating on behalf of the
condemned prisoners in violation of a law barring protests near
Parliament.
   At Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, two cameramen
for the Visnews television agency were detained while filming a
protest against the hangings by about 1,000 students.
   The government's Information Ministry held simultaneous news
conferences in Pretoria and Cape Town, showing reporters videotapes
of similar mob killings and issuing a nine-page background report
on the case.
   Referring to worldwide appeals for clemency, Dave Steward,
director of the Bureau for Information, told reporters in Pretoria,
``Some of the requests came from leaders of countries for which
South Africa has the highest regard.
   ``There was a great temptation to intervene for humanitarian and
political reasons. However, the responsibility of the state
transcends'' those reasons, he added.
   In Cape Town, Deputy Minister of Information Stoffel van der
Merwe said, ``The government is ignoring political pressure in
order to treat each case absolutely on its inherent merits.''
   Steward told reporters that since anti-apartheid violence and
protests began in 1984, with the Sharpeville riots in which Dlamini
was killed, 706 black South Africans had been burned to death.
   ``No emergency meetings of the United Nations Security Council
have been held regarding the hundreds who have been killed by mob
violence,'' said Steward, adding there had been no international
expressions of sympathy for Dlamini.
   President Reagan and the leaders of Great Britain, France,
Italy, West Germany, the European Community, the United Nations and
many international and domestic religious, labor and political
groups have called on Botha to grant clemency. The governments of
Japan and Greece today announced they, too, asked South Africa to
reconsider its decision.

   A legal dispute over a $135 pair of
glasses damaged on the seat of a fire truck will cost the city and
firefighters union $1,157.
   ``If nothing else, it was a good learning experience,'' Lt.
Cecil Cornish, president of International Association of
Firefighters Local 2445, said Wednesday of the union's $578.50
share.
   The union filed a grievance after Frank Neeld, vice president of
the local, left his glasses on the seat Sept. 19. The next day,
firefighter Timothy Gutman sat on them as he climbed behind the
wheel.
   Neeld demanded reimbursement under a contract clause calling for
repair or replacement of glasses damaged or destroyed ``in the line
of duty.''
   ``Leaving glasses on the seat of a firetruck where anyone could
have reason to drive it was negligent,'' contended City Manager
Randall Reid. ``And being on duty or at work was not what the
contract intended by `in the line of duty.'
   Arbitrator J.A. Raffaele of Philadelphia sided with the city in
a March 13 ruling on the grievance. ``The dignity of a
collective-bargaining agreement,'' he wrote, ``should not be
compromised by an interpretation that reduces its meaning to
absurdity.''

   An explosion rocked a testing
laboratory today, sparking a fire that forced the evacuation of
industrial plants a half-mile away. Authorities said three people
were killed and one injured.
   Among the hazardous materials used at Gollob Analytical Services
are radioactive hydrogen and krypton, and the solvents xylene and
benzine, said Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Jim
Staples. Light industrial buildings within a half-mile downwind
were evacuated as a precaution, and employees heading to work at
neighboring buildings were sent home.
   Volunteer firefighters, working upwind of the one-story lab,
thought they had extinguished the blaze by 6:30 a.m., nearly 4{
hours after it began, but it flared up again a half-hour later,
officials said.
   The identities of the victims were not known, said police Chief
Ralph M. Del Duca. A 30-year-old man was in critical condition in
surgery today at University Hospital in Newark, said nursing
supervisor Mary Kwasek.
   Police at first reported two dead in the fire, but officials
said later at a news conference that three bodies had been
recovered.
   ``I have no information as to why they were in there. The
company does not have a night time operation. But it is not unusual
for employees to work on special projects overnight,'' said Philip
Solomon, Union County emergency managment coordinator.
   State inspectors will check a nearby brook that runs into the
Passaic River for contamination, and a township crew built a
sandbag dam around the plant to contain runoff water from the
firefighting, Staples said. The air around the plant also will be
checked for chemicals and radiation, he said.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
said he and his Soviet counterpart briefly debated the reported
Nicaraguan incursion into Honduras today before concluding three
days of talks on an upbeat note.
   Carlucci said he protested the incursion to Soviet Defense
Minister Dmitri Yazov, who ``made some attempt to defend the
Sandinista action.''
   ``I would not characterize it as a vigorous defense,'' Carlucci
told a news conference before leaving Bern for Washington.
   Carlucci said he consulted with the White House overnight and
endorsed the decision to send an emergency U.S. force to Honduras
on exercises.
   The Sandinistas said they had chased Contra rebels to the
Honduran border, but the Nicaraguan defense ministry denied
Sandinista troops entered Honduras.
   The Soviet Union provides Nicaragua with military and economic
aid. At a news conference, Yazov did not address the issue of
Nicaragua specifically.
   ``We spoke out in favor of greater predictability and stability
in the Soviet-U.S. military balance,'' he said. ``We tried to
better understand the logic of and rationale for U.S. actions in
the military field.''
   Carlucci described his talks with Yazov, which were closed to
reporters, as ``cordial and businesslike'' and said he had been
invited to Moscow to continue the discussions at an unspecified
date.
   He said he had not obtained the apology he requested for the
fatal shooting by a Soviet soldier of U.S. Army Maj. Arthur
Nicholson in East Germany three years ago. Yazov said the incident
occurred before he became defense minister last May, said Carlucci.
   ``He said he would undertake to investigate it'' through the
Soviet Foreign Ministry, which has been handling the issue Carlucci
said.
   To avoid such ``dangerous activities,'' Carlucci said, ``Gen.
Yazov and I agreed that more would be done in this area.''
   Both agreed that ``there is no need for shooting,'' said
Carlucci. ``Gen. Yazov was firm on that.''
   Carlucci said the chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff,
Adm. William Crowe, and the Soviet Chief of Staff, Marshal Sergei
Akhomeyev, would meet soon, probably in Washington, to work out
guidelines to prevent friction between U.S. and Soviet ground, air
and sea, forces.
   Yazov repeated Kremlin assurances that Soviet troops would be
withdrawn from Afghanistan, but was unable to set a timetable,
pending the outcome of stalled peace talks in Geneva, said Carlucci.
   The two sides also discussed space-based missile defense,
negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals, and regional
conflicts, including Angola, Cambodia and Korea, he said.
   The Soviets proposed an experiment of a new method of
determining the presence of nuclear-tipped, sea-launched cruise
missiles aboard vessels, a technique mentioned last December by
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev but never explained to the West.
   Carlucci expressed doubt about the technique, but said the
United States was willing to review the propsed experiment, details
of which were not available.
   The Soviets want to impose a limit on such weapons as part of
the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty now under negotiation.

   Four Israeli soldiers went on trial today on
charges of brutality against Palestinians in the first such cases
to reach court since violence erupted in the occupied territories
more than three months ago.
   Two soldiers pleaded guilty to reduced charges in the burying
alive of four Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, and two
others pleaded innocent in the televised beating of two
Palestinians.
   Also today, Israeli warplanes raided PLO bases in the Chouf
Mountains south of Beirut, and the army said all targets were
destroyed. One guerrilla was reported killed and two people were
injured.
   Israeli newspapers said Secretary of State George P. Shultz
might return to the Middle East in late March or early April to
continue his mission to reach an accord between Israel and the
Arabs for starting peace talks.
   Senior military officials said Israel imposed new restrictions
against Palestinians, ruling for the first time that any Arab
wishing to bring $1,000 or more into Israeli-held territories from
Jordan must receive permission.
   The measure was intended to curb Palestine Liberation
Organization-provided funding for the current unrest. The money has
helped shopkeepers on strike and aided Arab families whose homes
were destroyed by the Israeli army.
   In addition, dairy and produce deliveries were not permitted to
enter the cities of Nablus, Tulkarm and Jericho, Arab reports said.
The army said it was checking the report.
   In a military court in Jaffa, Pvts. Yair Nissimi and Dror
Segen-Cohen were accused of assault and abuse for helping bury
alive four Palestinians with a bulldozer after a Feb. 5
demonstration in the West Bank village of Kfar Salem.
   A third soldier, Sgt. Mjr. Charlie Danino, was being tried
separately on the same charges, as well as unbecoming conduct.
   Nissimi and Segen-Cohen accepted a reduced charge of shameful
conduct under a plea bargain placed before a panel of three
military judges. They were to be sentenced to two months and 2{
months in jail, respectively.
   ``I'm sorry about everything that happened,'' Nissimi told the
court. ``I know I made a mistake.''
   Attorneys for the two soldiers charged in the beating incident
filmed by CBS Television _ Pvts. Sagi Harpaz and Yehuda Angel _
said the soldiers entered pleas of not guilty and the trial was
recessed.
   Attorney Uri Slonim, representing Harpaz, said his client would
argue he had carried out his mission of dispersing a demonstration
``in a way that seemed correct under the circumstances'' and had
only used the ``amount of force needed to carry out his mission.''
   About 250 reserve soldiers, meanwhile, submitted a petition to
government leaders today supporting the Israeli army in its attempt
to quell the unrest in the territories.
   The dailies Yediot Ahronot, Maariv, Haaretz and Jerusalem Post
all reported that Shultz, having received an equivocal answer about
the U.S. peace plan from visiting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, is expected to return to the region either late this month
or early next month.
   Haaretz also reported that despite Shamir's opposition to an
international conference, Shultz, who meets next week with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Washington, would propose
the two leaders jointly appeal to the United Nations to convene
such a session.
   The attack on Lebanon came a day after a volley of Katyusha
rockets was fired from south Lebanon into a community in north
Israel. An Israeli army spokesman said the rockets shattered
windows and damaged citrus trees, but caused no injuries.
   In clashes Wednesday, four Arabs were shot and killed by troops,
bringing the Palestinian death toll to 100 since the uprising began
Dec. 8, according to the United Nations.
   Also Wednesday, the occupied lands were paralyzed by a general
strike, ordered by the PLO-affiliated underground leadership of the
uprising in a clandestine leaflet. Most stores were shuttered,
public transportation halted and most of the 110,000 Arabs who work
in Israel stayed home.

   Congressional Republicans who investigated the
Iran-Contra affair today criticized the indictments of two former
White House officials and two other men, but Democrats said the
charges buttress last year's findings.
   ``I personally think that the indictment counts are pathetic,''
said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``You have in this particular case 30 full-time lawyers, 50
investigators, millions of dollars being spent by the government,
an overwhelming onslaught of legalities here, '' said Hatch, one of
the Reagan administration's strongest supporters during last
summer's hearings.
   Rep. Richard Cheney, R-Wyo., said on the NBC-TV ``Today''
program, ``I don't think that men like Poindexter ... and North
deserve to end up being prosecuted on criminal grounds that deal
with their service in government. ... I'm not sure the indictments
are warranted but I'm sure at this point probably the only way to
resolve it is to go forward with the trials.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contra
committee, who also appeared on ABC, said the charges are similar
to the conclusions reached by the legislative panels, although the
committees didn't apportion criminal blame.
   ``When we set out, there were a number of laws that we thought
had been broken. ... The indictments track these findings in our
report very carefully,'' said Hamilton.
   ``These are very serious offenses, said another Democrat from
the Senate panel, Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, on NBC.
   ``I think it should be noted that the prosecutor (Lawrence
Walsh) is a lifelong Republican, a former deputy attorney general
in a Republican administration, appointed to the court by a
Republican president so there are no political implications in the
prosecution,'' said Mitchell.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., an administration supporter on the
Iran-Contra panel, said earlier, ``this is only the beginning of
what will be a very long legal process that will question the
sufficiency of the indictments and the constitutionality of the
laws.''
   He said ``the indictments are premised on some assumptions that
may or may not be true, like title to the money. The prosecutors
believe the money from the sale of weapons to Iran belonged to the
U.S. Treasury and therefore it was misappropriated for the Contras,
but I think a very good argument can be made that the proceeds of
the sale don't belong to the Treasury.''
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate committee,
said, ``I personally remain convinced that they (the four men)
exhibited insufficient sensitivity to the rule of law, and to the
fact that under our system of government the Congress must make the
laws.''
   But he added that ``we must await the verdict of a jury of their
peers as to whether this insensitivity was criminal in nature.''
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, another administration defender
during the hearings, noted that the White House was charging that
Nicaraguan troops had entered neighboring Honduras to battle the
Contras.
   ``It's ironic that on a day when indictments were handed down in
Washington against the very people who tried desperately to keep
the freedom fighters alive, Sandinista troops were in Honduras
trying to wipe out the freedom fighters once and for all,'' McClure
said.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., a candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination, said, ``whatever the outcome of these
prosecutions, I think the special prosecutor has given as fresh
evidence that the Reagan administration generally has put the
Constitution of the United States through the shredder.''
   ``This will be an important issue in the campaign,'' Gephardt
said, particularly the role of Vice President George Bush, who is
the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
was introduced today to the Communist East's ``doorway to Europe,''
an industrial region in northern Yugoslavia that has realized his
dream of joining the world trading community.
   Gorbachev received a less enthusiastic welcome here than he did
in Belgrade, where he spent the first three days of his five-day
tour of Yugoslavia.
   More than 1,000 people gathered in Ljubljana's Revolution
Square, but the Soviet leader and his wife, Raisa, were greeted
with only polite applause. Cheering, shouting crowds welcomed the
Gorbachevs to Belgrade.
   Belgrade is the center of Yugoslavia's Serbian republic, which
traditionally has had closes ties to Moscow.
   At an electronics plant in Slovenia, Yugoslavia's northernmost
republic and one of the most prosperous regions in the Communist
world, Premier Dusan Sinigoj told Gorbachev his semi-autonomous
republic is bound to the West both culturally and economically and
now concentrates on developing new technologies for export.
   ``Slovenia represents a doorway to (Western) Europe,'' selling
more than half the goods it produces abroad, he told the Soviet
leader. Slovenia has only 8 percent of Yugoslavia's population but
produces 25 percent of the nation's exports.
   The Soviet Union is Slovenia's second-largest trading partner,
behind West Germany.
   Unders Gorbachev's program of ``perestroika'' or restructuring,
the Soviet Union is trying to encourage joint ventures with Western
firms, hoping to produce more goods for export and improve trade
with hard-currency countries.
   Gorbachev responded in good nature to criticism about his
restructuring plan.
   Franc Sifkovic, general director of the Iskra Avtomatika plant
that Gorbachev was visiting, complained that decentralization undur
perestroika had complicated the firm's dealings with the Soviet
Union. Now, he said, Iskra must deal with individual managers
instead of with a single government ministry, as in the past.
   ``Then restructure yourself,'' the Soviet leader said with a
smile.
   During a tour of one branch of Iskra, the largest electronics
and appliance enterprise in Yugoslavia, Gorbachev was shown
equipment made for export to the Soviet Union and was introducud to
the research and development division of the plant.
   Keeping up with Western technology and developing improved,
state-of-the-art equipment is central to Iskra's business strategy
and is what Gorbachev hopes for Soviet enterprises.
   If Gorbachev was impressed with the advanced products and
methods, he gave little indication publicly. His remarks were
confined to expressions of friendship and a desire for improved
Soviet-Yugoslav relations.
   Yugoslavia has a $1.4 billion trade surplus with the Soviet
Union but has beun unwilling to accept Soviet manufactured goods in
compensation for the debt. Officials here say Soviet products,
notorious for poor quality, won't sell in Yugoslavia.
   Although the average wage in Slovenia is about 500,000 dinars,
or $365 a month _ nearly twice that of Yugoslavia as a whole _
Gorbachev's motorcade passed a shantytown near the Iskra plan that
illustrated the nation's economic crisis.
   Yugoslavia's runaway inflation is pegged at 170 percent a year,
and 15 percent of the country's workforce is jobless.
   Western influence is apparent in Slovenia shops, which sell a
variety of West European products from flashlight batteries to
automobiles. Slovenia borders both Austria and Italy, and Yugoslavs
_ unlike Soviets and most other East Europeans _ may travel freely
abroad.
   Slovenians living along the border often do their shopping in
Austrian and Italian stores, and many work in Austria.
   The republic industrialized rapidly after World War II and
benefitted by being able to obtamn raw materials cheaply in
Yugoslavia and export manufactured goods to world markets.

<TEXT>
   More than 300,000 people turned out under
cloudy skies today for Dublin's St. Patrick's Day parade in a
celebration intensified this year by the 1,000th birthday of the
Irish capital.
   Street vendors did a brisk trade selling sprigs of shamrock, and
a hamburger chain sold ``shamrock-flavored'' shakes in the
traditional Irish color _ green.
   Across the border in the British province of Northern Ireland,
the festivities were overshadowed by Wednesday's deadly attack on
an Irish Republican Army funeral in Belfast. Three people were
killed and 68 wounded.
   But in Ireland, theaters, pubs and hotels have been throbbing
with traditional Irish music, drama and folk dancing this week,
which has been designated St. Patrick's Week.
   Patrick, who tradition says brought Christianity to the pagan
Irish in the 5th century, is the patron saint of Ireland.
   About 6,000 people took part in the Dublin parade, which winds
along a three-mile route from St. Stephen's Green to O'Connell
Street, the main thoroughfare.
   Police estimated that more than 300,000 people, including about
10,000 tourists, mainly Americans, turned out to watch the
procession of dancers, marching bands and historical-theme floats
pass by.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey took his place on a reviewing
stand outside the General Post Office in O'Connell Street and
called the colorful carnival ``one of the best ever.''
   Government offices, schools, banks and most businesses were
closed in the south for the national holiday, but many industries,
offices and department stores remained open in Northern Ireland.
Churches were thronged for morning Mass and pubs were packed with
imbibers.
   Organizers said the Dublin parade was being televised by more
than 80 TV stations in the United States and Canada.
   Patrick, the son of a deacon and apparently born in Wales, was
consecrated a Catholic priest in A.D. 432 and sent to Ireland,
where he was largely credited with organizing the Christian
communities.
   In Belfast, mourners wearing shamrocks and green armbands
attended the funeral of a slain IRA guerrilla a day after a man
opened fire and hurled grenades in Milltown Cemetery during the
burial of three IRA guerrillas shot by British commandos in
Gibraltar March 6.
   On Wednesday, Haughey appealed to Ulster's Roman Catholic
minority to ``to respond with calm'' to the attack at the IRA
funeral.
   The IRA, outlawed in Britain and Ireland, is fighting to drive
the British out of Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the Catholic Irish Republic.

<TEXT>
   Iraq fired another long-range missile
into Tehran today, and Iran said Iraqi troops used outlawed
chemical weapons to halt an Iranian advance into eastern Iraq.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said 28 civilians
were killed in the attack on the capital and in Iraqi raids on four
other cities.
   The agency said Iraqi troops lobbed chemical bombs into Halabja
and Dojaila in the Kurdistan region, ``killing many defenseless
residents.'' It gave no other details.
   Iran had reported overruning Dojaila and that Halabja, a town of
70,000 inhabitants near the border, was under siege.
   Iraq denied there has been any fighting in the region, saying
there were no Iraqi armed forces there. It claimed the Iranians
moved into some Kurdistan villages unchallenged.
   Iran also reported air raids on the cities of Bakhtaran, Tabriz,
Miyaneh and Abadan. It gave no breakdown of the civilian deaths.
   The missile strike was reported by the official Iraqi News
Agency, which said Iraq is bombarding ``the nest of evil, the
hideout of the charlatans, because instead of accepting peace they
have chosen the course of aggression.''
   Iraq says it has launched 23 missiles into the Iranian capital
since Sunday, when the ``war of the cities'' reignited after a
two-day truce.
   Iran has reported firing seven missiles into Baghdad and dozens
into Basra, Iraq's second largest city.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian forces
today fired seven short-range missiles into Zoubair, an industrial
town south of Basra. It said the attacks were in response to
``Iraq's latest atrocities,'' but did not elaborate. The news
agency said long-range artillery also pounded a string of towns
close to the 730-mile front.
   Neither side has been precise on casualties, but Iran said 70
people were killed in Iraqi attacks Wednesday on Tehran and cities
in western Iran.
   Iran claimed its ground offensive into northeastern Iraq's
Sulaymaniyah province gained momentum with the capture shortly
after midnight of Dojaila, which IRNA said has a population of
20,000.
   The Iraqi agency quoted an unidentified spokesman as denying
there has been any combat in the region and that there are no Iraqi
troops in the area.
   He said Iranian troops marched on Halabja and leveled it.
   IRNA said Iranian Revolutionary Guards also seized key road
intersections, cutting off all supply routes to the region from
Baghdad, which is 160 miles to the south. Iraq has not reported any
major fighting in the snow-capped mountainous province.
   IRNA said 2,500 Iraqi soldiers were killed or wounded and 1,000
captured in the fighting, raising the number of Iraqi casualties in
two days to 3,600 with 1,800 prisoners taken. It gave no breakdown
for the dead and wounded and the figures could not be independently
confirmed.
   The news agency said Iranian combatants had seized 115 square
miles of Iraqi territory in the region, including about 40 villages
and towns. It said the prisoners included Maj. Gen. Ali Hussein
Obaid Al-Algawi, who it described as the commander of Iraq's 43rd
infantry division.
   IRNA also said Iranian warplanes struck economic targets in the
region in pre-dawn raids and that two Iraqi warplanes were downed.
   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council in New York demanded an
end to the missile attacks on Baghdad and Tehran and endorsed
another round of negotiations by Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar on implementing its July 20 cease-fire resolution aimed at
ending the 7{-year-old war.
   Iran has criticized the Security Council for failing to take
action on the war of the cities and one diplomat said Tehran has
broken all ties to the body.
   Both Iran and Iraq are known to possess internationally banned
weapons, and Iraq has been condemned by the Security Council for
using chemical bombs.

   Cathy Evelyn Smith, who admitted
injecting comedian John Belushi with the heroin-cocaine
``speedballs'' that killed him in 1982, has been released from
prison after 15 months.
   Ms. Smith, 40, a native of Canada who pleaded guilty to
involuntary manslaughter and three drug counts, faces immediate
deportation, said Joe Flanders, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   She was paroled Wednesday from the California Institution for
Women in Frontera, said Hal Tanner, chief deputy superintendent.
Tanner called her an ``excellent inmate'' who ``abided by the

   Belushi, 33, was found dead March 5, 1982, in a bungalow at the
Chateau Marmont hotel on Hollywood's Sunset Strip.
   The portly comic, who gained fame on ``Saturday Night Live'' and
moved on to star in such movies as ``Animal House'' and ``The Blues
Brothers,'' had embarked on a drug binge with Ms. Smith that ended
in the bungalow.
   Ms. Smith later admitted she and the comic injected
``speedballs,'' a mix of cocaine and heroin, but she denied
responsibility for his death.
   She fled to Canada, but returned in June 1986 and pleaded guilty.

   On the day their deliberations would become
part of their nation's history, 21 Iran-Contra grand jurors became
the stars in an unusual media show.
   Since grand jurors deliberate in secret, they rarely have to
contend with dozens of reporters outside their meeting room. But
Wednesday was different.
   Before the jurors arrived at the federal courthouse, rumors had
spread through Washington's press corps that indictments were
imminent against the major players in the Iran-Contra affair.
   When independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh entered the building
in the morning, he told reporters to stick around. That was all
they needed to hear. The vigil was on.
   Dozens of reporters gathered behind rope barriers outside the
normally quiet hallway used by the jurors.
   Reporters didn't know the jurors' names, but studied their faces
each time they emerged for a break, straining for signs that 14
months of grueling work had ended.
   ``This is it,'' someone would yell from the sometimes noisy
press area, setting off a false alarm.
   During six hours of on-and-off deliberations, Walsh and his
prosecutors repeatedly entered and left the jury room, setting off
new speculation that it was over.
   By late morning, Walsh told reporters, ``These things can take a
long time.'' He didn't say what the ``things'' were. He didn't have
to.
   Then, Walsh was called down to the grand jury at 3:54 p.m. EST.
The jurors filed out, and their deadly serious faces sent reporters
dashing to a fourth floor courtroom.
   Twelve minutes later, the grand jurors and Walsh were seated in
the courtoom, and in came federal Magistrate Jean Dwyer.
   ``Your honor, this is grand jury 87-4, empaneled Jan. 28,
1987,'' courtroom clerk Maureen Lawrie said.
   After the grand jury was polled, Ms. Lawrie said, ``Mr. Foreman,
have you anything to report to the court?''
   ``I do,'' said the foreman, who then handed the 101-page
indictment to the clerk.
   The indictment was not read aloud.
   Dwyer thanked the jurors for their service and reporters ran
from the room like a thundering herd.
   The jurors left quietly _ thankful, presumably, that their long
ordeal was over.

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. today
advanced $1 billion to banks owned by First RepublicBank Corp., a
Dallas holding company, in a rescue package that could ultimately
rival the government's largest bank bailout.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman called the assistance ``an
interim step'' to provide needed stability to First Republic's
subsidiaries and depositors.
   Seidman said his agency, which insures deposits at commercial
banks, would guarantee all of the subsidiary banks' deposits as
well as money owed to general creditors of the banks. Creditors of
the holding company are not protected by this arrangement, he said.
   The action goes beyond the minimum the agency would normally be
expected to back up, which is deposits of $100,000 and less.
   First RepublicBank is the 13th largest in the nation, with $33.2
billion in assets and 73 subsidiary banks. The holding company
reported a loss of $656 million last year.
   First RepublicBank acknowledged Tuesday it had been forced to
seek federal aid because of a deteriorating loan portfolio and
difficulty in raising deposits.
   A First RepublicBank spokesman said Wednesday the bank had
experienced a runoff of deposits the day before, but that the
situation apparently had stabilized. An earlier drain of deposits
and customer defections had forced it to begin preliminary
discussions with the FDIC, the spokesman said.
   Seidman said the FDIC was seeking a long-term solution to the
holding company's problems and was talking to private investors who
may want to participate in a restructuring of the company.
   He declined to be more specific, but in past transactions the
agency has provided insurance money in conjunction with an infusion
of funds from private investment groups.
   The largest-ever bank rescue was the $4.5 billion rescue in 1984
of Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust of Chicago. The FDIC
expects to recoup much of its initial outlay in that bailout, and
expects its ultimate cost to be about $1.7 billion.
   Seidman said he could not say what the eventual cost of the
First Republic rescue would be. However, he noted that First
Republic and Continental are about the same size.
   He said that unlike the case with First Continental _ a failure
attributed to mismanagement _ ``it's very clear the primary reason
for this problem is the economy of Texas.''
   Seidman said the FDIC will assume some control of the subsidiary
bank's operations, although not day to day. He said the current
bank's management will remain in place for now, but said changes
could be discussed later.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who appeared at a news conference with
Seidman, said that despite a record number of bank failures, the
Texas economy is on the mend. ``We feel we're in the backwash of a
tidal wave that hit the Texas economy about two years ago (with the
collapse of oil prices). ... The basic economic future looks bright
when compared to the recent past.''
   The $1 billion advance is in the form of a six-month note from
the FDIC.
   The subsidiary banks are pledging their stock as collateral for
the infusion, and the parent company is guaranteeing it.
   The collateral is being pledged by 29 of the subsidiary banks,
representing about 80 percent of the holding company's assets.
   The largest subsidiary is First RepublicBank-Dallas, with $19.5
billion in assets.
   Federal Reserve Board member Manuel Johnson, who also appeared
at the news conference, said First Republic has been borrowing at
the Federal Reserve's discount window for the past several days. He
refused to say how much the bank had borrowed, but did say the bank
had pledged its loans and other assets to back up its borrowings.
   The FDIC reported a post-Depression record of 184 bank failures
last year, more than half in the oil-rich states of Texas,
Louisiana and Oklahoma.
   So far this year, 38 commercial banks have failed nationally.
   The First Republic aid would not have a significant impact on
the fund, Seidman said. The FDIC's insurance fund finished 1987
with $18.3 billion, up slightly from the end of 1986 despite the
failures.

   Three blacks, including a
policeman, were killed and 20 people injured today when a powerful
car bomb exploded outside the courthouse and police station in
Krugersdorp, police reported.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said police believed the
bomb was planted by Heinrich Grosskopf, a white who allegedly
belongs to the mostly black African National Congress.
   Vlok described Grosskopf as a ``trained terrorist'' and blamed
him for another car bombing last July outside army headquarters in
Johannesburg that injured 68 people. A $25,000 reward for
Grosskopf's arrest was announced.
   Authorities said those killed in Krugersdorp were a police
warrant officer, a mortuary worker, and an unidentified man. The
injured included 17 whites, among them a 15-month-old baby, and
three blacks.
   The blast occurred a day before the scheduled hangings of six
blacks, known as the ``Sharpeville Six,'' who were convicted of
complicity in a 1984 mob killing during anti-apartheid riots. Less
than seven hours after the explosion, a judge in Pretoria granted a
four-week stay of execution.
   The six were detained in Krugersdrop for a brief period between
their arrest in 1984 and the start of the their trial in 1985.
   Capt. Reg Crewe, a police spokesman, said the explosion at 8:30
a.m. destroyed three cars parked outside the court building. He
said the blast was caused by a 55-pound explosive device placed in
the trunk of one of the cars.
   Later, police said they found two limpet mines in a toilet of
the courthouse and removed them safely.
   The blast caused extensive damage to the courthouse and police
station in Krugersdorp, a farm and commercial center 20 miles
northwest of Johannesburg. Adjoining buildings also were damaged
and windows broken up to four blocks away.
   A bomb outside the magistrate's court in Johannesburg in May
1987 killed four people.
   There have been more than 70 bombings in South Africa since a
nationwide state of emergency was imposed June 12, 1986.
   The government has blamed most of the incidents on the outlawed
African National Congress, the guerrilla group fighting to end
domination of the government and economy by the white minority.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The beleaguered government announced
today it was taking over all public services a day after a failed
coup attempt by rebel officers sparked anti-government rioting by
thousands of people.
   Soldiers loyal to military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
patrolled the streets after Wednesday's rampage by people fed up
with military rule and Panama's financial crisis.
   The disturbances were the largest since civilian opponents began
staging demonstrations calling for Noriega's ouster last summer.
   Dressed in battle gear and armed with shotguns, sidearms, tear
gas cannisters and rubber truncheons, the soldiers were spread
throughout the city and were on every corner in many areas.
   The coup attempt Wednesday was led by Panama's police chief,
Col. Leonidas Macias, but was quickly crushed.
   The United States has been using economic and political pressure
to try to force Noriega to step down as military leader and leave
the country. As head of the 15,000-member Panama Defense Forces,
Noriega is the power behind the civilian government.
   The government decree covered electric service, communications,
ports, water services, airports, hospitals and the farm and dairy
products marketing institute.
   The decree said Defense Forces were instructed to ``cooperate''
with the government agencies and insure that public order is
maintained.
   Electric power shut off by striking workers Wednesday was
restored early today, but then went off again.
   Wednesday's protests erupted spontaneously throughout the
capital and in the country's second largest city, Colon, 50 miles
to the north.
   Security guards fired into crowds that ransacked stores and lit
barricades of trash on fire in Panama City, but no deaths were
reported.
   By midafternoon, the demonstrators were dispersed, buses and
taxis stopped running and the city was virtually deserted, except
for patrolling soldiers.
   The attempted coup was the first indication of opposition to
Noriega within the Panama Defense Forces.
   The coup attempt began an hour after dawn with the crackle of
light arms fire inside the walled Defense Forces headquarters in
the capital.
   After eight hours of official silence, the Defense Forces
finally acknowledged at midafternoon that a coup attempt had taken
place, blaming a handful of officers led by Macias.
   A statement from the Defense Forces' press office said Macias,
three majors and a captain were arrested and that the revolt was
put down ``without bloodshed.''
   But Maj. Edgardo Lopez, head of the military press office, told
reporters that ``eight or 10 officers'' were involved in the
aborted coup. He did not explain the discrepancy.
   An hour after the shooting began, Noriega appeared at the top of
a stairway outside the headquarters building, dressed in civilian
clothes and accompanied by members of his high command.
   To shouted questions from reporters about what had happened, the
general replied: ``What has happened is that you are visiting us
here today.'
   Asked about the shots, he replied: ``They were kisses.''
   Despite official evasions, word of the coup attempt spread and
people poured into streets of the capital that were strangely
devoid of riot police and soldiers.
   Demonstrators erected flaming barricades of trash and debris
across hundreds of streets, roughed up suspected government
informers and broke into stores believed to be owned by Noriega and
his supporters.
   In the central business district, a mob of hundreds pushed a
parked car through the plate-glass windows of a store they believed
is owned by Noriega, then set the vehicle ablaze.
   Security guards fired on the crowd from the building's upper
windows, but no one was injured. Flames destroyed the store.
   By midday, unpaid workers at the state-owned utility joined
strikes called earlier by teachers, health department and other
government employees. The entire nation was left without
electricity.
   Noriega was indicted last month by two federal grand juries in
Florida on drug trafficking charges that link him to Colombia's
infamous Medellin drug cartel. Spain formally offered him asylum.
   Banks remained closed by government order for the 12th straight
day on Wednesday. Most had closed days earlier because of a run on
deposits and the government's inability to provide them with cash
to cover withdrawals.
   The bank run began Feb. 26, when the Noriega-dominated
Legislative Assembly dismissed the nation's civilian, figurehead
president, Eric Arturo Delvalle. The day before, Devalle had
ordered Noriega to resign.
   The United States has halted all military and economic aid to
Panama and withheld $6.5 million in Panama Canal fees due this week.

   Terminally ill nursing home patients
will be able to reject forced tube-feedings under a new state rule
that takes effect July 1.
   Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services filed
an admininstrative rule change Wednesday that will allow nursing
homes to continue care for dying patients who reject tube-feedings.
Homes now have to discharge patients if they don't accept forced
feedings.
   ``It's important because it gives more options and more freedoms
to somebody dying in a nursing home,'' said Connie Cheren, director
of the HRS licensing office. She said seven people who testified on
the forced-feeding issue at a January public hearing all favored
the change.
   There are at least 50,000 nursing home residents in Florida.
   ``It's better because sometimes forced feeding is more harmful
to the person than helpful,'' Ms. Cheren said. ``Sometimes taking
the food during the dying stages is more painful for the person
because the body is shutting down at this time.''
   HRS spokesman Ray Wise said the department filed the rule change
early to give the Legislature time to look at it. The change does
not require the Legislature's approval but it could block the new
rule.
   ``If there will be a challenge to it, we want to give the
Legislature the benefit of time to address this in the regular
session,'' Wise said.

   Here is a summary of Wednesday's indictment in
the Iran-Contra affair naming former National Security Adviser John
M. Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord and businessman Albert Hakim.
   
   CONSPIRACY _ All four men were charged with conspiring to
defraud the United States by illegally funneling money and other
support to the Nicaraguan Contras at a time when such covert aid to
the rebel group was banned by a law known as the Boland Amendment.
   The four also were accused of conspiring to commit fraud by
``deceitfully exploiting'' the sale of arms to Iran ``for their own
purposes'' rather than the purpose of the sales, which the
indictment said included the release of American hostages in
Lebanon.
   
   THEFT _ The defendants were charged with theft of government
property by converting ``to their own use'' proceeds from the
weapons sales. The indictment said the arms sales generated
proceeds of some $30 million but that the U.S. government was paid
only about $12.2 million.
   
   WIRE FRAUD _ The four were accused of carrying out the diversion
scheme by using wire communications in interstate and foreign
commerce.
   
   OTHER CHARGES _ Poindexter was charged with two additional
counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements. North was named in nine additional counts involving
obstructing Congress, making false statements, obstructing justice
and a presidential inquiry, destroying official documents and
conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, an
additional charge of obstruction of justice was lodged against
North in connection with the FBI's investigation of the
installation of a security system outside his home. Secord was
charged with three additional counts of conspiring to pay illegal
gratuities to North, including financial aid to educate North's
children and money to pay for the security system for the North
home. Hakim was named in two additional counts of conspiring to pay
illegal gratuities to North.
   
   PENALTIES _ The harshest penalty is 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine for theft of government property. Most of the other
conspiracy and fraud charges carry a maximum term of five years and
a $250,000 fine. The illegal gratuity charges are punishable by two
years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

   A Republican senator predicted today that the
Senate would override President Reagan's veto of a sweeping
anti-discrimination bill and said the administration has only
itself to blame.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the White House should have
proposed a compromise while the Civil Rights Restoration Act was in
the hearing process or on the floor _ not after both chambers had
passed it by overwhelming margins.
   Reagan offered a less sweeping alternative to the bill Wednesday
along with his veto.
   But McCain said its chances of success were ``very poor... It's
very tough around here to switch your vote. It's very, very
difficult to ask people to take new positions when this whole issue
has been percolating for four years.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was hoping
for a vote on overriding the veto today. But he said he had been
hearing reports that the opposition strategy involved ``a long
debate.''
   Civil rights leaders called the veto one more entry in a dismal
civil rights record and said Congress will prevail as it has before
in the last seven years.
   ``This administration is compiling the worst civil rights record
of any administration in half a century,'' officials of the
200-group Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said in a statement
Wednesday.
   ``This will hurt Mr. Bush more than anybody else,'' said Rep.
Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and
Labor Committee, referring to Vice President George Bush's
presidential candidacy.
   Both the Senate and the House passed the Civil Rights
Restoration Act by huge margins that were expected to hold up
during override votes in the Senate and the House, which is
scheduled to take up the matter Tuesday. A two-thirds majority is
needed to override.
   ``President Reagan may want to turn the clock back on civil
rights, but the American people do not,'' said House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said Congress has repeatedly thwarted
administration officials' attempts to change the nation's civil
rights course.
   He accused Justice Department officials, including Attorney
General Edwin Meese III, of ``distorting the meaning of the bill,
pandering to the Republican right and engaging in an unseemly
effort to escalate their long-standing anti-civil rights vendetta.''
   The restoration act is also known as the Grove City bill for the
Pennsylvania college involved in the Supreme Court case that
started the controversy.
   The 1984 decision said only specific programs or activities
receiving federal aid must comply with the anti-discrimination
statutes. That meant discrimination could continue in a school's
athletic department, for example, if only the English department
received federal money.
   The new bill would require institution-wide compliance with
civil rights laws by educational institutions, state and local
government agencies and many corporations if any part received
federal aid. It applies to discrimination against women,
minorities, the aged and the disabled.
   The House passed the Grove City bill 315-98 on March 2. The
Senate passed it 75-14 on Jan. 28.
   Supporters of the bill said Congress had always intended wide
protections in order to make sure taxpayers don't end up
subsidizing discrimination.
   But Reagan said the bill would ``vastly and unjustifiably extend
the power of the federal government over the decisions and affairs
of private organizations, such as churches and synagogues, farms,
businesses, and state and local governments.''
   The Moral Majority mounted a last-minute effort to win enough
support to block a veto override. The group said Wednesday it had
sent a letter and a 40-page legal memo to the district offices of
all House members this week echoing Reagan's views on the bill.
   In a message last week to tens of thousands of pastors, the
Moral Majority said failure to obey ``this perverted law could
result in lawsuits costing millions of dollars being brought
against our churches by militant gays, feminists and others who
have no respect for God's laws.''

<TEXT>
   The Writers Guild of America has refused to
approve temporary contracts with independent movie and television
producers, a move that will keep in reruns such programs as ``The
Tonight Show.''
   ``Both coasts have voted against granting interim agreements,''
guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said Wednesday after the union's
East Coast board of directors voted in agreement with the West
Coast board's Monday night decision.
   About 80 independent production companies, including Carson
Productions, had sought interim agreements to continue work despite
the writers' strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers.
   ``He'd like to work. He's certainly unhappy,'' said Johnny
Carson spokesman Jim Mahoney after learning of the decision. ``He
doesn't like to stand around. But he certainly understands.''
   Another official strike casualty is ``Late Night With David
Letterman,'' which had its first unscheduled rerun Tuesday night
after a week-long scheduled hiatus. Production already has been
postponed on two new mid-season shows for CBS, ``The Smothers
Brothers Show'' and ``The Dictator.''
   The guild previously rejected a request to exempt from the
strike the April 11 Academy Awards show.
   The 9,000-member guild went on strike against producers and
studios March 7 over residuals from foreign distribution, creative
control and a management proposal to restructure residuals for
one-hour television shows sold into syndication. No new talks are
scheduled.
   The continuation of the strike also is likely to shorten the
season of some top television series, including NBC's ``L.A. Law,''
``The Cosby Show''' and ``Cheers,'' and ABC's ``Moonlighting.''
   The Hollywood Reporter said delays could affect some planned
cliffhanger endings designed to draw viewers back for new-season
debuts.
   ``Moonlighting'' star Cybill Shepherd told the paper the show
had no material beyond Wednesday, and ``L.A. Law'' star Richard
Dysart reportedly said the last two shows of the season may have to
be canceled.

   Armenians stayed away from work and school for a
second day today in a disputed region of Azerbaijan, an Armenian
official said.
   An official radio report said the mayor was fired in in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, where government officials said 32
people were killed in ethnic rioting last month.
   The actions stem from a dispute over whether the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan should be annexed to
neighboring Armenia. The region, north of Iran and east of Turkey,
has a large Armenian population.
   Armenians touched off a wave of unrest to press that demand on
Feb. 13 in Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, Stepanakert. Protests
spread to Armenia's capital, Yerevan, and led to violence in at
least two cities in Azerbaijan.
   Gamlet Kocharyan, an industrial worker and member of the
governing council of the Armenian city of Kafar, said workers
struck for a second day in Stepanakert to demand annexation to
Armenia. Factories and schools were closed because of the strike,
and 40,000 people demonstrated outside Communist Party offices, he
said.
   Kocharyan said he received the information from Armenian
activists in Stepanakert. He spoke in a telephone interview.
   The report could not be confirmed because the government has
barred Western journalists from traveling to the region, and
telephone calls to officials of the area were cut off.
   The official media in Moscow did not report the strike, and
representatives of the Azerbaijani government in Moscow said they
had no information about the matter.
   Baku Radio, the mouthpiece of the government in the Azerbaijani
capital, reported that the mayor of Sumgait had been fired by the
ruling council.
   The station, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London, said Tavakkula Yagub Ogly Mamedov was relieved of his
duties for ``serious shortcomings in the work of maintaining
appropriate law and order and discipline in the city, and for the
lack of political foresight he has shown which has resulted in
tragic consequences.''
   Government spokesmen have said 32 people were killed in rioting
in Sumgait on Feb. 28 by ``young hooligans'' provoked by ethnic
unrest elsewhere. Armenian activists say the victims were Armenians
killed by ethnic Azeris, the dominant group in Azerbaijan that is
mostly Shiite Moslem. Armenians are predominantly Christian.
   The regional party committee of Nagorno-Karabakh scheduled a
meeting Thursday at which the annexation demand was expected to be
discussed, Kocharyan said.

   The premiere of a film featuring John Hurt,
Sarah Miles and Geraldine Chaplin is among highlights of North
America's oldest film festival, which opens here today.
   ``White Mischief'' from Columbia Pictures is a murder mystery
set against a backdrop of the British aristocracy in Kenya's Happy
Valley during the 1940s. The movie, based on the book by James Fox
and directed by Michael Radford, also stars Charles Dance, Greta
Scacchi and the late Trevor Howard.
   The 31st San Francisco International Film Festival will continue
through March 27th, offering 86 feature films, from Argentina,
India, Greece, Egypt, the Soviet Union, China, Denmark, Australia
and 24 other countries.
   French filmmaker Robert Bresson has been named winner of the
1988 Akira Kurosawa Lifetime Achievement Award and a series of his
films will be shown, including the American premiere of the comic
short, ``Les Affaires Publiques'' (1936). The film, Bresson's
first, was believed lost for nearly half a century.

<HEAD>China Agrees Not to Block Rescue Ships</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China agreed today not to block rescue
ships from three Vietnamese freighters it allegedly set ablaze, and
Vietnam proposed talks to resolve the clash near disputed islands
in the South China Sea, official media said.
   The Vietnam News Agency said Beijing's ambassador to Vietnam, Li
Shuching, gave the assurance in a meeting in Hanoi with Vietnam's
First Deputy Foreign Minister, Dinh Nho Liem.
   ``The Chinese side has agreed not to let its warships prevent
Vietnamese rescue vessels from rescuing Vietnamese sailors on board
the freighters, which were set ablaze at the Sinh Ton group of
islands of Vietnam,'' said the report monitored in Bangkok.
   Vietnam had charged that the warships had intercepted two
unarmed Vietnamese vessels flying Red Cross banners.
   The freighters were allegedly attacked Monday in the Spratly
islands, which Vietnam calls the Truong Sa archipelago and China
calls the Nansha islands. Both nations claim the islands.
   A Vietnamese agency report Wednesday said some Vietnamese
sailors were wounded in Monday's clash and that 76 crewmen remained
aboard the freighters, which continued burning after the attack.
Vietnam's ambassador to Thailand, Le Mai, told a press conference
in Bangkok today that some Vietnamese were killed.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said some Chinese were
wounded.
   The Voice of Vietnam radio, monitored in Bangkok, said the
proposal for talks came in a letter from Vietnam's Foreign Ministry
to its Chinese counterpart. Liem delivered the letter to Li, it
said.
   ``The Vietnamese side ... advocates talks to solve disputes
between the two countries concerning the Truong Sa archipelago as
well as their common border, and the Hoang Sa archipelago,'' the
letter said.
   The Hoang Sa, called the Xisha by China and also known as the
Paracels, is the second major island group in the South China Sea
over which both countries claim sovereignty. Vietnam and China also
share a long, tense land border where they fought a war in early
1979.
   China was a major supporter of the Vietnamese communists during
the wars against the French and Americans, but relations have been
poor since the late 1970s, particularly after Vietnam ousted a
pro-Chinese government in Cambodia.

   Mourners wearing shamrocks and
green armbands today streamed through the streets of Belfast in a
funeral procession for a slain IRA guerrilla.
   The Irish Republican Army appealed for calm during the funeral
for 33-year Kevin McCracken, who was buried a day after gunmen
killed three people and wounded 68 at another IRA funeral.
   McCracken was shot to death Monday by a British army patrol that
he fired upon.
   Mourners followed the coffin through West Belfast to the Roman
Catholic Milltown cemetery, the scene of Wednesday's attack by
Protestant gunmen.
   IRA gunmen, in their traditional salute to their movement's
dead, fired three volleys of gunfire in a side street near
McCracken's home. They lined up on a sidewalk next to a photograph
of McCracken, which was surrounded by wreaths.
   ``Britain attacked us yesterday. ... Let Britain take a lesson
from our presence here today: you can never defeat us,'' Jim
McAllister, a leading member of the IRA's political wing, Sinn
Fein, said at the graveside.
   The funeral passed quietly. The outlawed IRA had advised police
earlier to stay away, and they did.
   During the night, rioters enraged by Wednesday's cemetery attack
firebombed five houses in Protestant North Belfast and burned
buses. One woman was treated for smoke inhalation, but there were
no other injuries reported.
   The attack occurred during a funeral for three IRA guerrillas
who were shot by British commandos in Gibraltar on March 6. They
were unarmed and allegedly planning a bombing attack.
   Police said they were holding a Protestant, Michael Stone, who
allegedly mounted the cemetery attack, and an accomplice. Police
gave no other details on the two, who can be held without charge
for seven days.
   Police kept out of sight as more than 1,000 mourners followed
McCracken's coffin, draped with the Irish flag, from his family's
two-story rowhouse to the nearby Holy Trinity Church for a Mass.
   Stewards from Sinn Fein removed McCracken's black beret and
gloves from the coffin before it entered the church.
   Black flags adorned the windows of homes along the route of the
slow procession, headed by a piper playing a lament.
   Relative calm returned to this British-ruled province in time
for McCracken's funeral.
   Overnight, police said Catholic gangs stole 24 vehicles in
Belfast and two in Londonderry, setting many of them ablaze. They
said rioters bombarded security forces with gasoline bombs, rocks
and bottles filled with acid.
   In Belfast, police fired plastic bullets to disperse the rioters.
   There were no injuries reported.
   Mainstream Protestant organizations disavowed the cemetery
attack. The Rev. Ian Paisley, hard-line leader of the Protestant
Democratic Unionist Party, said Wednesday that all ``right-thinking
Protestants'' would condemn it.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said an anonymous caller
telephoned its Belfast office and claimed responsibility for the
attack on behalf of a little-known extremist faction, the
Protestant Action Force. The BBC said the caller gave no code word
establishing authenticity.
   The group has claimed responsibility for previous sectarian
assassinations.
   Belfast city councilman Brian Feeney of the moderate Catholic
Social Democratic and Labor Party predicted in a BBC radio
interview today that the funeral attack could trigger fierce new
sectarian strife in the province.
   ``It was a dreadful provocation for the (Irish) nationalist
community. ... People who support the IRA will be asking that there
should be some retaliation,'' he said.
   Authorities said 16 of the 68 people injured in the funeral
attack remained hospitalized today. One was in critical condition
with severe head injuries and four others were seriously wounded.
   The British government called the attack ``insane and depraved''
and appealed for calm. So did Sinn Fein.
   The gunman could have been emboldened by the deliberate absence
of police at the funerals of Mairead Farrell, 31, Daniel McCann,
30, and Sean Savage, 24.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said
it had agreed to appeals by the families to keep away after the
Catholic Church assured it there would be no graveside military
displays by the IRA.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive the British from
Northern Ireland and unite the province with the maily Catholic
Irish Republic.

<TEXT>
   Armed with $1 million for a statewide
media campaign and a beefed-up staff manning banks of toll-free
telephone lines, the state will begin reuniting people with money
left in dormant bank accounts.
   The final legal hurdle in a $47 million Bank of America
settlement was cleared Wednesday when Superior Court Judge A.
Richard Backus approved an agreement worked out with the state
controller's office.
   Backus effectively ended the 13-year fight over Bank of America
accounts improperly charged, and in some cases totally wiped out,
by service fees levied on dormant savings accounts. He ordered that
nearly $1 million be used for controller office staffing increases
to handle the added work load.
   Controller Gray Davis must now try and find what may be millions
of people whose inactive accounts were turned over to him under the
state's unclaimed property law and return the money to them or
their heirs.
   ``This is the biggest reunification project that we have ever
undertaken and probably the biggest one in the United States,''
said D. Robert Shuman, chief counsel to Davis.
   In 1975, then-state Controller Ken Cory sued Bank of America and
other banks, contending they had no legal right to levy service
charges on dormant accounts or to fail to credit the accounts with
interest.
   Levying service charges on inactive accounts has been outlawed
since 1976 unless financial institutions give customers advance
warning.
   Under the 1959 unclaimed property law, financial institutions
must search for customers whose accounts have been dormant for
seven years. If they cannot locate them, the contents are turned
over to the controller, who also must make a search.
   Backus ordered the controller's office to mount an aggressive
``outreach'' effort, including the hiring of the Los Angeles public
relations firm of Rogers and Associates to publicize the pay-back
operation.
   To get the word out to bank customers, the controller's office
will buy television advertising and announce the program in radio
and television public service spots, Shuman said.

   Passengers of the fire-crippled cruise ship
Scandinavian Star, under tow to port in Cancun today, will receive
refunds and tickets for another Mexican cruise, a company
spokeswoman said.
   The 465-foot ship, built in France in 1971 as a ferry and
converted to a cruise liner in 1984, was disabled by an engine fire
early Wednesday about 35 miles off Isla Mujeres in the Yucatan
peninsula. It was under tow today by a Mexican Naval destroyer,
escorted by a U.S. Coast Guard cutter.
   Capt. Garcia Silva, commander of the Mexican naval base at Isla
Mujeres, said the fire apparently was sparked by a broken fuel line.
   None of the ship's 449 passengers or 266 crew members was
injured by the fire, although two passengers were flown to a
hospital in St. Petersburg.
   A 71-year-old Florida resident was admitted in stable condition
overnight for observation. A Florida man was treated for a back
injury and released.
   Jill DeChello of Miami-based SeaEscape Ltd., which runs the
Star, said the passengers would be reimbursed their $179 to $499
fares, and get a free cruise. When the ship reaches Cancun,
passengers will be flown on chartered planes to St. Petersburg, the
Star's port, she said.
   It was unclear when the Star might resume operations because
damage couldn't immediatley be assessed, Ms. DeChello said.

   The co-pilot of a commuter aircraft that crashed
near Durango in January, killing nine people, had a history of
alcohol abuse dating back to 1972, according to court records.
   Ralph Darrell Harvey, who was killed in the crash, had been
convicted twice of drunken-driving offenses, according to Arapahoe
County criminal files.
   Harvey, 42, was considered a problem drinker and had been
ordered to attend two alcohol education and therapy programs, said
John Toplenicky, chief deputy Arapahoe district attorney.
   The Continental Express plane crashed Jan. 19 near Durango, 350
miles southwest of Denver, killing both pilots and seven
passengers. Eight passengers survived.
   The backgrounds of the pilots have been under scrutiny since the
National Transportation Safety Board disclosed finding traces of
cocaine in the body of the pilot, Stephen S. Silver, 36, last week.
   Authorities said Silver had used cocaine within 24 hours of the
crash. But the NTSB does not know which pilot was flying the plane
or why it crashed.
   FAA documents obtained Wednesday also showed Silver did not
report convictions of eight traffic infractions he had in the four
years before the crash. Federal law requires such disclosure. The
traffic violations would not necessarily result in FAA sanctions,
but failure to disclose them could result in revocation of a
pilot's license, officials said.
   Harvey had reported at least one drunk driving conviction to the
FAA.
   Tom Byrne, an attorney representing Trans-Colorado Airlines,
declined comment on Harvey's record.
   Trans-Colorado, based in Colorado Springs, employed the crew and
leased the plane to Rocky Mountain Airways, a Continental
subsidiary that flies under the name of Continental Express.
   Byrne said he did not know if the airlines knew of the pilot's
background when Harvey was hired a few months before the crash.

   Lt. Col. Oliver North's former secretary,
Fawn Hall, said charges against the Marine and others in the
Iran-Contra scandal are no surprise, as she defended him in a
speech to a university audience.
   Ms. Hall conceded mistakes were made in the sale of arms to Iran
and distribution of some of the proceeds to the Contras in
Nicaragua, but she added Wednesday, ``You have to look at the
intention. I think Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North's intentions
were good.''
   The federal grand jury indictment ``was something that we have
expected for some time,'' she told about 300 people at the
University of Puget Sound. The mostly supportive crowd listened
over the chants of 30 to 40 protesters outside carrying signs with
messages such as ``Fawn Go Home.''
   Ms. Hall was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for
her testimony before the grand jury investigating the case.
   The issue ``is still quite emotional for me, especially today,''
she said. ``There are a lot of questions that I won't be able to
answer tonight because there is a pending investigation going on.''
   When a woman in the audience asked whether Ms. Hall believed two
wrongs made a right, Ms. Hall raised her voice and replied,
``That's not what I said.''
   She blamed the news media and Congress for what she said were
distortions, including ``sexual innuendoes repeated by our members
of Congress'' on her role in removing documents from her office.
   ``The Iran-Contra hearings were a circus,'' she said. The
hearings could be considered a ``cleansing process to see where the
policy went wrong, but there were many members (of Congress) who
wanted this to be another Watergate and get their names in
history.''

   A group of 10 journalists was hurriedly
assembled late Wednesday night to accompany American soldiers
ordered to Honduras by President Reagan, the Pentagon said today.
   The group of reporters, activated under what is known as the
Department of Defense National Media Pool, departed Andrews Air
Force Base, Md., outside Washington at 3:45 a.m. EST, the Pentagon
said.
   The reporters were then flown to Fort Bragg, N.C., the home of
the 82nd Airborne, and joined the first battalion from that
division to depart for Honduras at 7 a.m., the Pentagon added in a
statement.
   ``The pool deployment began at 11 p.m. last night with the
notification of the bureau chiefs, and initial pool reports are
expected to arrive at the Pentagon later today,'' the statement
said.
   President Reagan ordered four Army battalions to Honduras on a
``no-notice'' emergency readiness exercise Wednesday night in what
the White House called a ``measured response'' to the presence of
Nicaraguan troops inside Honduras.
   Pentagon sources have said the Nicaraguans crossed the Honduras
border in an attempt to destroy some large Contra guerrilla supply
camps. Fighting was said to be continuing this morning.
   According to the White House, the U.S. troops will not be
committed to combat, but rather will conduct some routine exercises
while underscoring the American commitment to the region and
deterring further Nicaraguan attacks.
   The National Media Pool was created in the wake of the 1983
invasion of Grenada, from which all American reporters were
excluded by the Defense Department. The Pentagon and press
ultimately agreed to set up procedures whereby a small group of
reporters could be scrambled, in secret, to accompany U.S. military
units as they deployed in the future.
   Before today, the media pool had been called out for six test
exercises and one operational deployment. The deployment involved
coverage of the first U.S. Navy convoy operation in the Persian
Gulf last July.
   While the sending of troops to Honduras was not conducted under
military secrecy, the Pentagon said the national media pool was
activated because it offered ``an excellent mechanism to provide
coverage of this type of (short-notice) exercise.''
   ``The pool concept has been employed seven times and has proven
to be effective,'' the Pentagon added in its statement.
   The Pentagon identified the 10 individuals assembled for the
pool as Steven Komarow of The Associated Press; Douglas Allmond,
ABC; Karl Inderfurth, ABC; Philip Mishoe, ABC; Durrell Kreisher,
Copley News Service; Jay Sapir, UPI; Joseph Marquette, UPI;
Frederick Kempe, Wall Street Journal; Robert Cohn, Newsweek, and
Colleen Combes, Reuters.

   Pope John Paul II will visit
five countries in southern Africa as a messenger of peace and
brotherhood, a Vatican representative said today.
   The pope will not visit South Africa, but will make brief stops
in Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique from Sept.
10 to 19.
   Southern Africa is ``an area of war, of violence and a place
where, very often, the dignity of man and his rights are trod
upon,'' said the announcement by the apostolic delegation in
Pretoria.
   The pope is scheduled to beatify a French priest during a Mass
at the race course in the Lesotho capital, Maseru, on Sept. 15.
   The priest, the Rev. Joseph Gerard, spent more than 50 years
traveling by horseback to visit the shepherds and farmers in 19th
century Basutoland (now Lesotho) and in the South African province
of Natal. In 1928, 14 years after his death, local people
attributed a miracle to Gerard _ the restoration of a blind girl's
eyesight.
   The pope begins his trip in Zimbabwe on Sept. 10, where he will
attend a regional meeting of Roman Catholic bishops.
   On Sept. 13, he makes a one-day trip to Botswana. He will meet
with priests in the Gaborone Cathedral and celeberate Mass in the
National Stadium.
   John Paul will go to Swaziland on Sept. 16 and arrive in
Mozambique that evening. He will return to Rome on Sept. 19.

   House Speaker Jim Wright today called a Reagan
administration decision to send troops to Honduras unjustified, as
lawmakers expressed skepticism about whether a reported Nicaraguan
military incursion is as large or as threatening as the White House
claims.
   ``I know nothing that justifies sending troops,'' Wright said,
adding that the move was ``potentially dangerous.'' He said he
hoped the troops would be kept well away from any fighting.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., emerging from a classified briefing on
the situation, said lawmakers were assured that ``we're not going
to be involved down there. That's the pledge given me.'' He said
``there had clearly been a penetration into Honduras'' by
Sandinista troops who were not in hot pursuit of Contras, but he
said he opposed the sending of more U.S. troops to the area.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd called President Reagan's
decision to send 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras an ``overreaction,''
and a number of other legislators said they were still waiting for
hard evidence from the White House to back up its claims.
   ``We've heard the administration cry, `wolf, wolf,' before,''
Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters. ``I don't know when they're crying
wolf.'' Byrd said that even by mid-morning today, he had neither
been briefed nor contacted by the administration about the troop
movement.
   ``I hope it does not prove to be counterproductive (and) does
not derail the peace process,'' Byrd said.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said: ``The White House has been
playing politics with American aid, they have been playing politics
with the Contras, and now they are playing politics with American
boys.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., generally a supporter of the
administration's Central America policies, said he was skeptical
about the need for sending troops.
   He said the Sandinista incursion into Honduras represented ``a
cynical abandonment of the peace process,'' but added that it does
not pose any serious threat to the United States, and therefore did
not clearly call for the sending of military forces.
   ``I think it's a move the president may come to regret because
the spectacle of American troops moving into Central America in
convoy, flying down there, I think is going to remind the American
people of why they don't want this,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., interviewed on NBC television.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said the incident highlighted the need for new
aid for the rebels, which has been twice rejected by Congress this
year. He said only renewed aid will keep a regional peace process
going.
   ``The ... plan only works if the Contras have some assistance
and therefore there is some reason for the Sandinistas to deal with
them,'' Lugar said in an interview on ABC. ``I think it's very
important that things get back to the table and I hope our policies
will lead to that.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif, said: ``I think you
have to ask the question of whether 1,200 Nicaraguans going across
the Honduran border is a threat to U.S. national security,'' as
Secretary of State George P. Shultz had argued in a briefing
Wednesday for congressional leaders.
   In announcing Reagan's decision late Wednesday night, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said thousands of Sandinista
troops had entered Honduras and the Honduran government had
appealed for help. He said that for the time being, the U.S. troops
would remain about 125 miles from the area of hostilities.
   Some lawmakers noted that Reagan is making a renewed push for
Contra aid and recalled a similar situation two years ago, when
Nicaraguan troops went into border areas of Honduras two days after
a House vote against aid to the Contras and just before a Senate
vote.
   ``They have cried wolf so many times ... even supporters of
Contra aid are somewhat skeptical,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
``It is apparently a major raid on a Contra camp in the jungles.
Now, that does not pose a threat to Honduras or its capital.''
   In the 1986 episode, President Reagan claimed that 1,500 troops
had gone across the border and used his emergency power to give
Honduras $20 million in military aid. Other U.S. officials later
put the number of troops at closer to 800, and it appeared that
Honduras had to be pressed to accept the ``emergency'' aid.
   ``This is not the first time the president has made use of his
military authority after he lost a vote on the Contras,'' Rep.
Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said Wednesday night. ``President
Reagan's decision to send the 82nd Airborne to Honduras has more to
do with politics than with American security.''
   But Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, appearing on
ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program, held to the administration position
that the Sandinistas were trying to deliver a ``death blow'' to the
Contras, who use Honduras as a haven. He said the administration
would document the seriousness of the Sandinista threat in material
submitted to Congress today.
   Some Republicans needed no convincing. Rep. Jack Fields,
R-Texas, said, ``I don't think the president really had an
alternative'' to sending in U.S. forces.
   ``The purpose is for them to demonstrate our commitment to
regional peace and stability,'' Fields said.
   But Byrd said the administration was going too far.
   ``It's an overreaction,'' he said. ``The Sandinistas have
crossed over the border before and gone back.''
   And Jason Isaacson, a spokesman for Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., said the senator saw the administration action as an
effort ``to divert attention from the Iran-Contra indictments and
to turn up the heat on Congress for more aid to the Contras.''
   Congressional leaders briefed Wednesday by top administration
officials on the cross-border fighting had said the White House
offered no proof that U.S. interests were threatened or that the
Contras were on the verge of being wiped out.
   The officials _ Shultz, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker
and National Security Adviser Colin Powell _ told of a 1,500-man
incursion targeted at Contra supply sources and the kidnapping of
rebel leaders, participants in the meeting said.
   But the troops had destroyed no major supply sites and captured
no top Contra commanders, the administration conceded.
   ``I suspect this is a little more orchestrated hype on the part
of the administration,'' Dodd said after the meeting.
   House Speaker Jim Wright said he was told by Nicaraguan Foreign
Minister Miguel D'Escoto that President Daniel Ortega had asked the
United Nations to send an observer group to the border area to
insure that neither side breaches the border.

   Japan's economy grew by 4.2 percent and its per
capita gross national product overtook the United States' last
year, the Economic Planning Agency reported today.
   The agency said Japan's per capita GNP _ the output of goods and
services for each member of the population _ reached $19,642,
compared with $18,403 in the United States. This was attributed
mainly to the yen's rise against the U.S. dollar.
   In 1986, when calculations were based on a dollar trading at
168.51 yen, the U.S. figure was $17,464 and Japan's was $16,330. In
1987, the calculations were based on a dollar for 144.62 yen. The
dollar currently is trading at about 127 yen.
   Japan had about 122 million people as of the middle of last
year, half of the United States' 244 million. But its economic
output is more than half that of the United States.
   The GNP growth of 4.2 percent in the calendar year 1987 compared
with 2.4 percent the previous year, helped by gains in housing and
industrial equipment investment.
   The Economic Planning Agency said Japan's GNP grew by an
inflation-adjusted 1.7 percent in the October-December quarter from
the July-September quarter, and the government's target of 3.7
percent growth for fiscal 1987, which ends March 31, was in reach.
   The original target was 3.5 percent, but it was revised upward
in December based on signs of an encouraging recovery in the
manufacturing sector. Manufacturing earlier had been slumping
because of the yen's rise, which makes Japanese products more
expensive and less competitive abroad.

   Troops in combat gear kissed their wives and girlfriends goodbye
today as the United States sent 3,200 soldiers to Honduras in what
the White House said was a ``measured response'' to Nicaragua's
incursion into that Central American nation.
   About 1,500 soldiers, or two battalions of the 7th Light
Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif., will join two battalions
from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., and support
units, the White House said Wednesday.
   The first of 26 C-141 transport planes left Pope Air Force Base
in Fayetteville, N.C., at 7:30 a.m. EST, carrying troops to
Palmerola air base in Honduras. The planes would leave 30 minutes
apart, said Lt. Gen. John W. Foss.
   The first planeload of troops arrived at Palmerola at 11:15 a.m.
EST, according to local radio stations transmitting from there.
   ``The soldiers are well-trained and prepared for this mission,''
said Foss, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg.
``They're excited but I would not say they are nervous. ''
   Dozens of trucks carried troops and supplies from Ford Ord to
Travis Air Force Base. The first C-141 from Travis lifted off at
11:29 a.m., loaded with two busloads of troops and pallets of
supplies. ``I expect it to go on all day,'' said Air Force Maj.
Wayne Crist.
   Several wives were told by their husbands that the battalions
would be flown to Florida, then to Honduras. Travis officials said
they could not confirm that arrangement.
   The White House on Wednesday ordered troops to Honduras in ``an
emergency deployment readiness exercise'' triggered by what it
called the invasion of Honduras by 1,500 to 2,000 Nicaraguan forces
pursuing Contra rebels.
   Military intelligence sources in Honduras said late Wednesday
that about 2,000 Sandinista troops were surrounded three miles
inside Honduras. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said troops had
chased Contra rebels into Honduran territory, but would not say
whether the soldiers had crossed the border.
   All 11,400 members of Fort Ord's Rapid Deployment Force were
engaged in a deployment readiness exercise when word came that two
battalions, between 1,100 and 1,200 soldiers, would go to Honduras,
officials said.
   At Fort Bragg, soldiers kissed their wives goodbye at marshaling
points on the sprawling base.
   ``It was really exciting,'' Pfc. Eugene Rice, 21, told The
Charlotte (N.C.) Observer. ``It was like, something's really going
to happen. We're finally going to get a chance to use our
training.''
   Another soldier told the News and Observer of Raleigh, ``They
told us to get our stuff together. They're rigging trucks that
they've never rigged before. People don't know what to think. They
don't know whether we're going to war or just doing a little
peace-keeping. They're on ends right now.''
   ``If we're going to do it, let's do it,'' Sgt. John Jones of
Atlanta said as he waited to board a plane.
   Lt. Jim Cooper was in a class when he got his orders, so he
didn't get a chance to say good-bye to his wife. ``We are not
allowed to do that,'' he said. ``But she understands.''
   As he spoke, Cooper put camouflage paint on the face of Lt.
Steve Swinley.
   ``It's like a job,'' Swinley explained. ``We train to do our
job.''
   The men said morale was soaring.
   ``It's the best I've ever seen,'' said Cooper. ``We're 100
percent ready.''
   The Rapid Deployment Force is trained to respond quickly to
assignments around the world. The daylong exercise involved
recalling troops to the base to check of weapons, vehicles and
other equipment, spokesman Paul Boyce said.
   There are 21,000 soldiers at Fort Ord, 80 miles south of San
Francisco.
   ``We're just hoping and praying nothing serious comes from
this,'' said Karen Brylewski, a civilian base worker, who said her
husband told her that his unit was scheduled to fly to Florida from
Travis this morning.
   Fort Bragg is home to the paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne and
the Green Berets and has sent troops to trouble spots around the
world, including Grenada during the the October 1983 U.S. invasion
and to Sinai for peacekeeping.
   Eight hundred paratroopers will be dropped about five miles from
the Honduran base, said Maj. Gen. Carl Stiner, commander of the
82nd Airborne. They will land in ``an area that's been cleared for
drops. Once they land, they will move to Palmerola air force base.
They then will establish liaison with the Honduran military and
begin conducting combined training exercises.''
   Lt. Col David Kiernan, a base spokesman, said the troops were
joining Joint Task Force Bravo, which includes about 1,200 soldiers
from Fort Bragg and other units already in Honduras.
   Kiernan called the action an ``off-post training exercise'' and
said that troops would not take part in hostilities.
   The Army also loaded a C-5 transport plane with equipment,
including three light observation helicopters, four Cobra gunship
helicopters, one Blackhawk UH-60 helicopter, a command vehicle and
ammunition, Stiner said.
   He said a battalion rigged for combat would remain at Pope on
alert status.
   In Durham, N.C., about 50 people attended a candlelight vigil
Wednesday night to protest the deployment of troops, said Mandy
Carter, director of the War Resisters League, which sponsored the
vigil with Witness for Peace.

   The Pentagon said Thursday it had assigned the
code name ``Golden Pheasant'' to the deployment of troops to
Honduras and that the roughly 3,200 soldiers were carrying their
normal weapons along with nine helicopters and two light tanks.
   The Defense Department, in a brief statement, said 55 Air Force
cargo planes would be used to fly two battalions from the 82nd
Airborne Division and two from the 7th Light Infantry Division to
Honduras.
   The 82nd Airborne units are staging out of Pope Air Force Base,
N.C., while the 7th Light Infantry units are staging out of Travis
Air Force Base, Calif., the Pentagon said.
   The Pentagon said the four battalions would be assembled into an
infantry brigade task force under the command of Army Brig. Gen.
Daniel R. Schroeder, the chief of staff of the XVIII Airborne Corps
at Fort Bragg.
   The battalions will conduct field exercises with Honduran units
after arriving today and Friday, the Pentagon said. The battalions
are carrying three OH-58 observation helicopters; four AH-1 Cobra
attack helicopters; 1 UH-60 utility transport copter, and 2 M-551
Sheridan light tanks, the Pentagon added.
   The Pentagon identified the individual units involved in the
deployment as:

   A bus traveling a winding mountain road
through heavy rain and fog plunged into a river on Thursday,
killing 27 people and injuring four, the Sao Paulo State Highway
Department said.
   The bus was carrying at least 31 people when it fell into the
shallow, muddy Casqueiro River in southeastern Brazil near the port
city of Santos, about 45 miles from Sao Paulo, said Nilton de
Carvalho, the department's operations director.
   He said 27 bodies were recovered, and 19 were identified. Of the
four survivors, two were hospitalized in critical condition,
Carvalho said.
   Buses that cover the Sao Paulo-Santos route normally pick up
other passengers along the way, so there may be more dead.
   Carvalho said the bus was on the river bed ``with its wheels
sticking out of the water.''
   The cause of the accident was unknwon.

<TEXT>
   Kathleen Noonan, who preserved the manuscript of
her Irish father's working-class novel, ``The Ragged Trousered
Philanthropists,'' has died at the age of 95.
   Robert Noonan's novel, written under the pseudonym Robert
Tressell, describes life among his fellow house painters and
decorators in the English south coast town of Hastings, which he
called Mugsborough.
   It was first issued in 1914 after his daughter, a nurse,
produced the manuscript from a tin box to show her employer and was
introduced to publisher Grant Richards.
   Ms. Noonan, who died Saturday in a nursing home in Bristol, kept
her maiden name after separating from her husband in Canada in
1918, said her father's biographer, Frederick C. Ball.
   Tressell died of tuberculosis in 1911 in Liverpool while waiting
to emigrate to the United States. He was buried in a pauper's grave.
   The first edition of his book contained about 60 percent of the
original manuscript and a full version only appeared in 1955, after
Ball bought the manuscript.
   ``The book is revered among building workers for its portrayal
of their life in Edwardian England and is slowly becoming
recognized as a masterpiece by literary historians,'' Ball said.

   A two-toned 10-franc coin, a first in France, will
go into circulation in the coming days and eventually replace the
heavy coin now in use, the government announced Thursday.
   Finance Minister Edouard Balladur also introduced a new symbol
for the French franc, a capital ``F'' slashed with two bars, to be
adopted in September.
   The new coin with a nickel center encircled by a copper alloy
bears an engraving of the winged spirit of the Bastille that tops
an obelisk in the Place de la Bastille, commemorating next year's
bicentennial of the French Revolution. The reverse side is
inscribed with the coin's value.
   The coin is the second 10-franc piece to be issued in two years.
A small 10-franc coin distributed in 1986 was recalled because it
too closely resembled the 50-centime piece, leading to confusion.
   Ten francs currently is worth about $1.78.
   The new French franc symbol replaces the ``f'' currently used as
shorthand for the franc. The two slashes across the capital ``F''
mean the symbol stands for franc and French, Balladur said.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ended
his talks here today after offering to go to Moscow this spring to
launch negotiations with the Arabs as a way of breaking a deadlock
over an international Mideast
   peace conference.
   But Secretary of State George P. Shultz, testifying in Congress
after a final session with Shamir, said ``the Arab parties require
a conference to launch negotiations.''
   Therefore, Shultz told the Senate Budget Committee, ``there will
be no negotiations without a properly structured conference.''
   Shamir, who had a one-hour breakfast session with Shultz to wind
up a four-day visit, flatly rejected a U.S. proposal for a
full-scale Mideast conference.
   It ``is not conducive to peace,'' he said Wednesday after
meeting for two hours with President Reagan at the White House.
   Shamir suggested direct Arab-Israeli negotiations be hold under
U.S. and Soviet auspices, but without a substantive role for Moscow.
   Shultz told the committee the United States has always been
willing to consider any approach that could lead to direct
negotiations.
   In fact, he said, ``the United States opposes, and will not
participate in, an international conference designed to replace
bilaterial negotiations.''
   Shultz said the U.S. proposal is designed to prevent
interference by the hosts in the Arab-Israel talks.
   ``This is a time for decision,'' he said. ``The situation on the
ground does not serve anyone's interests. Rapid, positive change
can occur.''
   Reagan on Wednesday cautioned that ``those who will say no to
the U.S. plan _ and the prime minister has not used this word _
need not answer to us. They'll need to answer to themselves and
their people as to why they turned down a realistic and sensible
plan to achieve negotiations.''
   Apparently ruling out any compromise, Reagan said ``the United
States will not slice this initiative apart and will not abandon
it.''
   Shamir, however, reaffirmed his willingness to hold direct
negotiations with Jordan and Palestinians under U.S. and Soviet
auspices.
   He said later at a news conference that Reagan and Soviet
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who will meet in Moscow in
the spring, could invite Israel and the Arabs to an ``international
ceremony'' and then step aside, allowing them to hold direct
negotiations.
   ``If there would be such a proposal, I am ready,'' Shamir said.
``It would be useful.''
   The prime minister said he would attend even if the Soviets did
not repair a 21-year break in diplomatic relations with Israel.
``It has nothing to do with it,'' he said.
   ``Such an international ceremony will give King Hussein and
other parties a clear international legitimacy for direct
negotiations,'' Shamir said.
   The idea of having the United States and the Soviets convene the
negotiations, but not participate in them, was broached to Shamir
in Jerusalem last October by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Shamir accepted, but King Hussein of Jordan rejected the
proposal. He called for an international conference held by the
five permament members of the U.N. Security Council _ the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
   Despite his own reservations, Shultz included an international
conference in the plan for negotiations he presented two weeks ago
to Israel, Jordan and Syria. It would be convened next month and
set the stage for negotiations starting May 1.
   According to a senior U.S. official, Reagan's meeting with
Shamir focused almost exclusively on the issue.
   The official, who briefed under rules of anonymity, said the two
did not review Israel's concerns about the U.S. proposal that it
cede at least part of the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for Arab
recognition.
   Shamir will report to the Israeli Cabinet on Sunday on his talks
here. Until then, the prime minister refused to either accept or
reject the U.S. proposal.
   Whatever the outcome, Shamir said, Israel intends to work with
the United States in behalf of peace in the Middle East.
   ``Sometimes there are differences between best friends,'' Shamir
said. ``And we regard the Americans as our best friends. Now we
have such a situation we have some differences with them. We will
try to overcome these differences.''
   Vice President George Bush, hosting a dinner for Shamir on
Wednesday night at the State Department, assured him ``no wedge
will be driven between the United States and Israel.''
   Toasting Shamir, the vice president said: ``We are like
brothers; our two countries, friends and allies forever.''
   Shamir, in reply, said Israel was proud of its record as the
most consistent supporter of the United States in the United
Nations and of sharing military technology with Washington. He said
the U.S.-Israeli relationship ``is stronger than ever.''

   President Reagan has not discussed pardoning
his former aides indicted in the Iran-Contra affair, his spokesman
said today.
   ``There's been no discussion of pardons,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said. ``We don't discuss pardons. Period.''
   Fitzwater was asked about such an action in light of Wednesday's
indictments of Reagan's former national security adviser John
Poindexter Lt. Col. Oliver North, and two arms dealers on charges
in the diversion of Iranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   The president has never criticized his aides for lying to
Congress, shredding documents or participating in a cover-up. And
while he has steadfastly refused to discuss the possibility of
pardons, he has been equally careful not to rule them out.
   But several presidential and Constitutional scholars said that
if he decides to pardon any of the Iran-Contra defendants, Reagan
probably will wait until after the November election to prevent the
issue from hurting Republican candidates.
   Reagan is well aware of the example of his Republican
predecessor, Gerald Ford, whose Watergate pardon of Richard Nixon
on Sept. 8, 1974, sent Ford's popularity ratings tumbling and
helped put a Democrat into the White House in the next election.
   In the case at hand, Reagan has made it clear _ particularly in
his description of North as an ``American hero'' _ that he is
giving the former national security council aide the benefit of the
doubt.
   After Congress completed its Iran-Contra investigation, Reagan
went on national television to say he thought North and Poindexter
``believed they were doing what I would've wanted done.''
   And when he was questioned at one point about the law barring
direct or indirect military aid to the Contras, Reagan responded:
``I don't think that the law was broken.''
   If Reagan chooses to grant pardons to anyone connected with the
affair, he would not even have to list a specific crime that is
being pardoned.
   Such sweeping power amounts to a legal grant of absolution,
enshrined in the Constitution. The Founding Fathers borrowed the
concept from English common law.
   The Constitution allows a president virtually unlimited
authority to pardon involving ``offenses against the United tates,
except in cases of impeachment.''
   ``He's really very free,'' said C. Thomas Dienes, a professor of
constitutional law at George Washington University.
   A president is able to grant a pardon involving a federal crime
solely on his own initiative _ he need not consult anyone nor even
wait for an indictment or conviction before taking action, Dienes
said.
   Dienes said the principal cost of a Reagan pardon ``would be
political.'' He said the president would have to make a case for
the pardon by arguing that he believed his subordinates had acted
in the cause of the national security, or that he wanted to spare
the country a national trauma.
   ``I'm sure he'd catch a lot of political flak, and he wants to
go down as a popular president _ but since North was perceived by
some as a popular hero, I'm not certain there'd be such negative
reaction,'' Dienes said.
   During his nearly eight years in office, Reagan has granted 333
pardons out of 1,894 requests, according to the Justice Department
office in charge of handling them. But none of the cases has had
anywhere near the high profile of the Iran-Contra indictments.
   Although Reagan is barred from running again, his decision could
affect Vice President George Bush's chances and those of other GOP
candidates, according to Stephen Hess, a senior fellow and
specialist in presidential affairs at the Brookings Institution in
Washington.
   Hess predicts that if Reagan decides to pardon any Iran-Contra
figures, he will wait until after the November elections.
   ``Since Ford's action cost him the election, I doubt we'll see
Reagan move before November,'' Hess said.
   Reagan would not leave such a decision to a Democrat, nor would
he burden Bush with it if he were elected, Hess reasoned.
   ``I would be stunned if there isn't a pardon between election
day and January 1989,'' he said.

   Sikh militants shot and killed five Hindu
employees of a bank Thursday after stealing the equivalent of about
$3,700 from the cashier, police said.
   Eight militants armed with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles raided a
branch of the Punjab National Bank at Bholka village, 17 miles
north of here, said district police chief Izhar Alam.
   The militants snatched the bank's cash box from cashier Kulwant
Rai at gunpoint, he said. Rai, bank manager Juni Lal and three
other Hindu employees were shot and killed after the militants
separated them from Sikh workers, Alam said. The other victims were
identified as Amrit Lal, 42, Ramesh Kumar, 36, and Yog Raj, 32.
   At least 466 people have been killed this year in attacks blamed
on Sikh militants. More than 1,000 people were killed last year in
the Sikh guerrilla war for a separate state.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are in a
majority in Punjab. The militants claim that Sikhs are
discriminated against by nation's Hindu majority, which makes up
more than 80 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Government Orders Steps To Save Dolphins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service on
Thursday ordered foreign nations that export tuna to the United
States to reduce the number of dolphins killed during fishing.
   Countries that do not reduce dolphin deaths will no longer be
allowed to export tuna to the United States, the Commerce
Department agency said.
   The order covers foreign fleets that catch yellowfin tuna in
purse seine nets, and requires them to establish dolphin protection
rules similar to those that already cover U.S. fishermen.
   The regulation will take effect in mid-April, and requires that
the rate of dolphins killed by the foreign fleets be reduced to the
U.S. fishing fleet level by 1991, the Fisheries Service said.
   The problem occurs primarily in the eastern tropical Pacific
Ocean, where fishing vessels search for schools of dolphins.
Yellowfin tuna tend to congregate beneath the dolphins, and thus
fishermen can more easily find the tuna.
   Fishermen then encircle both groups of fish with their nets. The
majority of dolphins are able to escape or are released by the
fishermen, officials said, but some become tangled in the nets and
drown.

   Mary Bea Porter couldn't save her golf
game, but she made a much more important save _ the life of a
3-year-old boy.
   Porter was trying to qualify for next week's LPGA tournament
when she jumped a 6-foot fence and revived the boy, who almost
drowned Wednesday in a backyard pool bordering the Moon Valley
Country Club course.
   Porter, 38, said she was lining up her second shot on the 13th
fairway when she saw Jonathon Smucker face down in the water. The
child's father, Christian, jumped into the pool fully clothed and
pulled out his son.
   ``But when I saw the father begin to shake the child and yell at
his wife (Anna) if she knew CPR, I knew that we were in trouble,''
said Porter, who added that she had no previous experience in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Porter said her caddy, who also didn't know CPR, helped her jump
the fence and she approached the father, who handed her the child.
   ``I thought he was dead. He was turning grey,'' she said. ``I
knew I had to do something. ... So I threw him on the ground,
reached in and cleaned out his mouth, moved his tongue to the side
and blew.''
   Finally, she said, she saw ``his little lungs inflate.''
   The child was crying in Porter's arms by the time paradmedics
arrived. He was in good condition Thursday at St. Joseph's Hospital
and Medical Center. The boy was visiting Phoenix from Ronks, Pa.,
with his parents.
   ``There is no doubt in our minds that Porter saved his life,''
said Fire Department spokesman Steve Jensen.
   And the golf game?
   Porter, who has won $50,000 in 15 years on the ladies pro golf
tour, bogeyed two of the next three holes, finished the round at 76
and missed qualifying for the Standard Register Turquoise Classic
by three shots.
   Still, she said, ``I feel like I just won a million
tournaments.''

   Bus workers began an indefinite strike
for more pay on Thursday, forcing the capital's 5 million commuters
to find alternate transportation.
   More than 550 employees of the Delhi Transport Corp. were
arrested under the Essential Services Maintenance Act, which
prohibits employees of essential services such as police, hospitals
and the fire brigade from going on strike, said police spokesman
Ravi Pawar.
   The strike, which idled the city's 5,000 passenger buses, forced
many people to walk or cycle to work.
   A lucky few managed to engage three-wheeled scooter rickshaws
and taxis, which increased fares because of the strike. Some
private buses transported commuters for a flat rate of about 16
cents, double the normal city service fare.
   School examinations scheduled for Thursday were postponed
because of the strike.
   In Parliament, Transport Minister Rajesh Pilot said the strike
was illegal and said the government would take action against the
workers.
   Buses are the main form of transport in New Delhi, a city of 8
million people. A rail system is used by few people because of its
limited area of operation.

<TEXT>
   A top NASA official warned the space
community Thursday that ``an absolute disaster to NASA'' looms if
Congress votes only a small increase in the space agency's budget
for next year.
   President Reagan has proposed a budget of $11.5 billion for the
year that begins in October, an increase of 20 percent over the
current year.
   Dale Myers, deputy administrator of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, told a symposium that where the 20 percent
increase is concerned ``we are probably not going to make it.''
   He said it probably will be closer to 2 percent.
   Myers told the American Astronautical Society there probably
wouldn't be any problem if NASA was dealing with only the
congressional committees that have oversight responsibility for the
agency.
   ``The problem is we're caught in this terrible budget crunch;
decisions are being made by a budget committee which is not that
familiar with the space program,'' he said at the Goddard Space
Flight Center.
   ``Last year we got hurt very badly,'' Myers said. ``We got a
budget cut and because of that now we are showing a 20 percent
increase in outlays this year compared to last year, and the
average increase is going to be something like 2 percent.''
   ``If we get the 2 percent increase, which is an easy out for
Congress, it is an absolute disaster to NASA,'' he said. ``We have
not even imagined what we would have to cut back if we are given a
2 percent situation. I just can't imagine that would happen _ but
it could happen,'' he said.
   Myers said it was unfortunate that space activities are in a
part of the budget ``where NASA, the National Science Foundation
and all the high technologies activity of the government are all
tangled up with some social programs where tradeoffs are being made
in a very isolated area.''
   Last week Rep. Edward Boland, D-Mass., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on housing and independent agencies,
threatened to cancel money for NASA's proposed space station if
housing programs were cut.
   Myers said NASA has never been caught in such a difficult budget
situation.

   The National Geographic Society released
pictures today of an Egyptian boat photographed with special
equipment in a stone chamber where the royal vessel was entombed
beside the Great Pyramid of Khufu 4,600 years ago.
   National Geographic officials said the photographs were taken
with remote cameras lowered through a drill hole and that the
chamber then was sealed, leaving the ancient craft undisturbed in
its resting place.
   A similar boat was found in a chamber nearby in 1954. That
142-foot-long craft was excavated, reassembled and put in a museum
specially constructed for its display. Officials said that boat now
is decaying rapidly.
   But new techniques permitted experts from the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization and from the United States to survey the
new boat using remote cameras, the National Geographic announced
today. The boat was documented last October and its chamber then
was sealed with the craft untouched.
   The National Geographic said in a release that a joint
U.S.-Egyptian team of scientists had hoped that the chamber
containing the new boat had remained airtight during the 46
centuries since it was sealed.
   In an effort to capture samples of that air, the scientists used
a drill enclosed in an air lock. An arrangement of vacuum tubes was
used to suck the chamber's air into storage tanks for analysis.
   ``The air in the chamber proved to be moderately polluted urban
air,'' said Pieter Tans, a scientist from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration who analyzed the samples.
   He said this proves that the chamber was not sealed and
possibily never was. Samples of the cap of the chamber, said Tans,
showed that the rock was a light limestone.
   ``The rock was so permiable that this pit probably has never
been sealed,'' he said.
   Remote television pictures taken inside the chamber detected a
beetle, which immediately proved, officials said, that the chamber
had been unsealed for some time.
   Tans said the insect was identified as a common desert beetle
that feeds on fungi that is commonly found in decaying wood.
   Television and still cameras lowered into the drill hole were
able to document the entire interior of the boat chamber. The TV
camera used fiber optics to light the chamber. In this way, the
lights added no heat to tomb environment.
   Photos released by the National Geographic show a mound of cedar
timbers collapsed to the floor of a long chamber that had been cut
with precision out of solid limestone bedrock.
   Scientists studying the pictures have identified various boat
parts, including oar blades, deckhouse and hull planking. There was
no sign of a mast, sail or rigging.
   The video camera detected hieroglyphic markings on the ceiling
of the chamber. The National Geographic interpreted these symbols
as measurements and as the name of the team of workers who carved
the stone used in the chamber.
   The National Geographic announcement said the purposes of the
boat, and of its sister craft excavated in 1954, remain a mystery.
   ``Why did the ancient Egyptians disassemble and bury two
full-size royal ships at the base of the Great Pyramid?'' the
announcement asks.
   The boats are thought to have been entombed to honor the Pharoah
Khufu by his son and successor Djedefre, according to the National
Geographic.
   But it is not known if the boats were used to bring Khufu's body
on the Nile from his palace at Memphis to the pyramid at Giza, or
if the craft were entombed in the belief that Khufu would use them
in an afterlife.
   A report on the exploration of the boat chamber is carried in
the April issue of National Geographic, the monthly magazine of the
National Geographic Society.

   The state civil rights agency has ordered
California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo to pay
$20,000 to a woman for four years of ``vicious treatment'' in a
campus industrial paint shop.
   The harassment of Carol Bowlby, the first woman hired by the
shop, included name-calling, placing a pictures of a naked woman in
her lunch box, and refusing to work with her, said the Fair
Employment and Housing Commission.
   Ms. Bowlby's work environment was ``offensive, hostile,
oppressive and intimidating,'' and contributed to her medical
problems and need for psychiatric care, the commission said in a
4-1 decision released Wednesday. It also said the university failed
to investigate her complaints properly or discipline her co-workers.
   Commissioner Michael Johnson dissented. He described Ms. Bowlby
as a ``substandard employee'' and said the shop was ``a
rough-and-tumble workplace where strong language and name-calling
were common.''
   The commission's majority said the university's ``sincere and
laudable effort ... to bring a woman into a male-dominated field,''
did not excuse ``the vicious treatment she did receive because of
her sex.''
   The commission awarded her $20,000 for emotional distress, but
concluded her departure from the job in 1982 was voluntary and
refused additional damages for lost wages.
   Attorney Gloria Barrios, who prosecuted the case for the state
Fair Employment and Housing Department, said Ms. Bowlby, whose
disability and rehabilitation costs have already been paid by the
university, now works at a grocery in San Luis Obispo.
   University lawyer Thomas Trager said no decision has been made
on an appeal to Superior Court. But he said the school denies that
Ms. Bowlby was harassed because of her sex.
   The commission said Ms. Bowlby's difficulties began almost
immediately after she was hired as the first woman in the
university's new trainee program for women and minorities in its
Plant Operations paint shop.
   Her job evaluations were satisfactory at first, but got worse as
time went on, and she was never rated as qualified to become a
full-fledged painter. She reacted badly to criticism and was
considered difficult to work with, the commission said.
   But those difficulties were caused at least in part by ``the
hostility she suffered because of her sex,'' the commission said.

<TEXT>
   Ireland cast aside its economic woes and
the latest violence in Ulster to stage its biggest ever St.
Patrick's Day parade Thursday, celebrating the Irish patron saint
as well as the capital's 1,000th birthday.
   A record crowd of 300,000 people, including thousands of
American tourists, thronged the three-mile parade route from St.
Stephen's Green to O'Connell Street, the main thoroughfare.
   Many adorned their lapels with sprigs of shamrock, the wild
clover that is Ireland's national emblem.
   About 6,000 people took part in the parade of dancers, marching
bands and historic-theme floats. Skies were overcast but the rain
held off.
   March 14-20 was designated St. Patrick's Week in honor of
Ireland's patron saint and Dublin's millennium celebrations, with
daily displays of Irish folk music, dance and street theater.
   In Northern Ireland, St. Patrick's Day celebrations were heavily
overshadowed by Wednesday's outbreak of sectarian violence, when a
Protestant gunman shot and threw grenades at Catholic mourners
burying three Irish Republican Army guerrillas in Belfast. Three
people died and 68 were wounded.
   Mourners wearing shamrocks and green armbands attended the
funeral Thursday of a slain IRA guerrilla a day after the bloodbath
at Milltown Cemetery. The service was peaceful.
   The violence had little visible impact on the Dublin parade. It
was a day to set aside thoughts of an unemployment rate near 18
percent, high taxation and an emigration outflow estimated at
30,000 a year.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey reviewed the parade from a stand
outside the General Post Office where rebels launched the Easter
Rising of 1916 against British rule.
   Organizers said crews from more than 80 TV stations in the
United States and Canada photographed the parade.
   Government offices, schools, banks and most businesses were
closed in the south, but many industries, offices and department
stores stayed open in Northern Ireland, where the majority is
Protestant and doesn't regard St. Patrick's Day as a national
holiday.
   The Irish also took a somewhat bemused look at how the United
States celebrates March 17.
   ``There's a bar in West 39th Street that is advertising live
leprechauns and bagpipe music tonight. ... There's even a Jewish
delicatessen on 47th Street offering Irish bagels,'' marveled the
Irish Times correspondent in New York, Eugene McEldowney.
   In Dublin, botanist Charles Nelson remarked: ``We tend to think
of the Americans as being a bit eccentric in this regard.''
   Some U.S. customs seemed to be catching on here. An American
hamburger chain was selling ``shamrock-flavored'' shakes.
   Roman Catholic churches were full for morning Mass, and later
the pubs filled up for celebrations.
   Some Irish newspapers marked the day by editorializing about it
in Irish, or Gaelic, which is the country's first official
language, although only a minority are fluent in it.
   The Irish Independent, editorializing in English, wondered what
St. Patrick, the 5th century missionary who Christianized Ireland,
would think of the country were he to return.
   ``As a missionary he would have to come to the conclusion that
the faith he worked so hard to spread here has come on bad times.
There are plenty of churches but they are not always packed. There
are many people who call themselves Christian but may not be
entitled to do so,'' it said.
   And if he went to Northern Ireland where he lived as a young
man, ``what would he make of the violence, hate and bigotry?'' the
paper asked.
   But it also noted that he would find a worldwide Irish diaspora
who ``carried with them into exile an attitude to life which was
fashioned basically by what Patrick taught our ancestors 1,500
years ago. That is a plus.''

   Gov. Evan Mecham testified today that he
never ordered anyone to hamper an investigation into an aide's
alleged death threat, but said he told Arizona's top police officer
not to cooperate with the probe.
   In his second day of testimony in his impeachment trial, Mecham
confirmed that in a Nov. 15 conversation with Department of Public
Safety Director Ralph Milstead, ``I said, `If you want my
permission you don't have it.'''
   Mecham acknowledged he told Milstead, ``The attorney general is
trying to hang me and I'm not going to help him.'' However, he said
he had never ordered anyone to hamper the investigation and denied
any intent to break the law.
   He said he told Milstead to tell Attorney General Bob Corbin's
office ``we have looked into this matter and there's nothing to
it.''
   The 63-year-old first-term governor said he had been told by
Department of Administration Director Max Hawkins that the alleged
threat was ``a bunch of hot air'' that would go away.
   Mecham said that when he was first told of the alleged threat,
the head of his security details, DPS Lt. Beau Johnson, did not
specify that it was reported to be an actual death threat.
   ``Did you ever hear the words from Lt. Johnson `death threat'?''
asked defense attorney Fred Craft.
   ``I absolutely did not,'' said Mecham. He insisted that Johnson
also did not say it involved a possible felony of tampering with a
grand jury witness.
   Johnson has testified that he told the governor the alleged
threat involved a possible felony of tampering a grand jury witness.
   Milstead testified last week that Mecham ordered him not to
cooperate with a Corbin investigation. The attorney general was
looking into an alleged death threat against former Mecham aide
Donna Carlson, who was about to testify before a grand jury on
Mecham's failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The governor, whose lawyers have been trying to undermine the
credibility of the state's top police official, testified Wednesday
he would have had ample grounds to fire Milstead. He said he also
would have fired Ms. Carlson had he known she told Milstead last
year the governor was considering replacing him.
   ``I had to trust the people I was dealing with,'' Mecham said.
Asked by Craft if the governor still trusted those people, Mecham
answered, ``Not some of them. ... It was a trust misplaced.''
   The governor contended an internal investigation showed that
Milstead misused state vehicles for personal purposes and used a
state secretary to type his masters' thesis.
   In response, DPS spokesman Sgt. Allan Schmidt said the
investigators ``found no reason not to retain him (Milstead) and no
problems, save his management style.''
   Mecham appeared calm and soft-spoken during his testimony
Wednesday. All 29 senators, who are serving as Mecham's judge and
jury, stood when he entered the Senate chamber and was sworn in.
Later, some said the action was suggested in a note passed around
by President Carl Kunasek, a Republican.
   Before Wednesday's session, Mecham had been away from the
capital for more than a month, operating out of a suburban office
he calls his ``government in exile.''
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial in
six decades, retains his salary and title, but Secretary of State
Rose Mofford, a Democrat, has gubernatorial power pending the
outcome of the trial.
   Testimony so far has focused on the charge that Mecham confidant
Lee Watkins, a former state prison construction chief, made a death
threat on Nov. 12 against Ms. Carlson. Watkins has denied any
threat, and has pleaded the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination in refusing to testify.
   Mecham said he did not consider Watkins, who arranged the
$350,000 campaign loan, to be a major fund-raiser for his 1986
campaign and that he did not seek to protect him, as Ms. Carlson
said he did.
   ``Protect him from what?'' the governor asserted. ``I'd like for
somebody to tell me what I protected him from.''
   The governor denied jobs were doled out in his administration
based on how much money a person contributed or raised for his
campaign.
   Ms. Carlson testified last week that when she once complained
about Watkins' position in the governor's inner circle she was told
by the governor's then-chief of staff: ``We have to take care of
Lee. He raised a lot of money for the campaign.''
   On Wednesday, Sam Udall, Mecham's former appointments secretary,
testified that campaign contributions were a criterion, although
not a major one, in making appointments to boards and commissions.
   Mecham said he felt he could not trust Corbin after the governor
sought his advice on a legal issue early last year and the matter
wound up under investigation.
   ``That's when I knew we were in big trouble,'' Mecham said,
adding that after that ``we had as little relationship with the
attorney general's office as possible.''
   Corbin's office led the investigation that resulted in Mecham's
indictment on six felony counts of allegedly concealing the
$350,000 loan. The governor faces an April 21 criminal trial on
those charges, and a May 17 recall election.
   In the impeachment, a two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is
required to convict Mecham.

<HEAD>Kim's Resignation Raises Hopes for United Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kim Dae-jung stepped down as leader of
his party Thursday, reviving hopes for reuniting the fractured
opposition before crucial legislative elections next month.
   Kim Dae-jung said he was resigning as president of the Party for
Peace and Democracy to help unite the two leading opposition
parties.
   The departure of Kim Dea-jung follows the resignation last month
of rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam, who headed the
Reunification Democratic Party. Both Kims ran for president in
December's presidential election, thus ensuring victory for the
government candidate, Roh Tae-woo.
   Since their presidential defeat, the two Kims have been under
pressure to step aside to clear the way for a merger of the two
parties.
   ``Standing at the crossroads of unification or division, I have
decided to step down to help facilitate the opposition merger,
which is our supreme task,'' Kim said in a statement.
   Park Young-sook, who read the statement, said the 62-year-old
Kim could not make the announcement personally because he was not
feeling well. Kim was reported to be in seclusion.
   Mrs. Park was named acting party president. She declined to
answer questions about what would happen if the opposition merger
failed. She said time was running out and expressed hope the
opposition would unite by Sunday.
   It was unclear, however, whether Kim Dae-jung's resignation
would lead to an opposition merger. Unification talks are expected
to start Friday, but such thorny issues as power distribution
remain to be solved.
   Kim Young-sam's party reserved official comment, but some party
officials privately expressed distrust and said they feared the
resignation would be a trick.
   ``We are skeptical in view of Kim Dae-jung's duplicity in the
past,'' said one party official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   The two Kims have been bitter rivals. Kim Dae-jung and his
supporters split from the Reunification Democratic Party to mount a
separate presidential campaign.
   Months of efforts to unite the opposition collapsed last week
when Kim Dae-jung rejected a last-minute demand from the
Reunification Democratic Party that he step down and take a back
seat if a unified opposition party is formed.
   Kim Dae-jung has been a major figure in South Korean politics
for three decades. He gained international fame with his
unflinching opposition to the country's past authoritarian
governments and devotion to human rights activity.
   Kim Dae-jung's party officials could not comment on their
leader's political future but assumed he would continue to work for
the opposition.
   Kim Dae-jung said in his resignation statement, ``I make it
clear that I will make all the efforts I can in the vanguard of the
people in order to win the general elections.''

<HEAD>Secord Vows to `Crush' Iran-Contra Charges Against Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard V. Secord, one of four men indicted in
the Iran-Contra affair, vowed Thursday to ``crush this whole case''
with a barrage of legal maneuvers against the independent counsel.
   Shortly after a federal grand jury returned the indictments
Wednesday, Secord, a feisty retired Air Force major general,
embarked on a series of interviews with reporters to denounce the
case.
   He called the charges initiated by independent counsel Lawrence
E. Walsh a ``creation of fantasy ... ludicrous.''
   Secord, 55, an arms dealer who helped former White House aide
Oliver L. North sell weapons to Iran and divert the proceeds to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels, has been charged with conspiracy, theft,
wire fraud and conspiring to pay North illegal gratuities.
   After his arraignment next week, Secord said his attorneys will
file motions to dismiss the case on a number of grounds. For one
thing, Secord claims Walsh did not follow all the Justice
Department's guidelines for independent counsels.
   ``I am going to crush this whole case in hopes that nobody else
has to go through what I have,'' Secord said in a telephone
interview. ``I view this in military terms: they have committed an
assault on me and I am going to launch a counterattack.''
   Last month Walsh hired Herbert Stern, a former federal judge, to
handle legal challenges stemming from the Iran-Contra case.
   Secord said he had not talked with North or the other defendants
_ his ex-business partner, Albert Hakim, and former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter _ about a coordinated defense
strategy.
   His big problem, Secord said, is raising money for his defense.
``The only guys who win in this are lawyers,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A widow who learned that her husband of
27 years had been a bigamist has been asked to return $610 in
Social Security benefits.
   Mazella Bouknight Lever, 80, said she learned after her
estranged husband Noisey died July 29 that the woman who was living
with him was his first wife, Carrie. She filed suit in February
seeking to evict the first Mrs. Lever.
   The government has written Mrs. Lever demanding repayment of
$610 in Social Security widow's benefits. ``Obviously, this is not
something that she did intentionally. She thought that, in fact,
she was the only Mrs. Lever,'' said her attorney, Stephen G. Smith.
   ``The point is, she received benefits as a basis of being
married to this man,'' said Berion Mouton, Social Security
assistant district manager. She must show she is unable to repay
the money if she wants to avoid it, he said.
   Mrs. Lever said she hadn't seen her husband since she moved out
in November 1982. They were married in 1960.
   Since his death, Mrs. Lever said, she has thought much about
Noisey's motive for not divorcing Carrie. ``I guess he was just
using me,'' she said. ``I could always keep a good job.''

<HEAD>Sign of the Times: Jackson's Advisers Include Bert Lance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In another era, it might seem an odd alliance
_ the white Southern political insider and the flamboyant black
civil rights activist. But in what Jesse Jackson calls ``the new
South,'' his relationship with Bert Lance is a sign of the times.
   Lance, long a fixture on the Georgia political scene and the
budget director under former President Jimmy Carter, is one of
Jackson's closest advisers in his 1988 presidential bid.
   ``I have a relationship that's fairly well known with Rev.
Jackson,'' Lance said in a telephone interview. ``He is a very good
candidate who has run a superb campaign.''
   Lance supported Jackson in Georgia's primary last week and,
according to Jackson aides, the two consult by telephone as often
as once a day.
   ``Jesse Jackson has got a message that the country is concerned
about _ especially about drugs, especially about economic common
ground. These things are important to the country,'' said Lance,
who left the Carter administration under a cloud of allegations
about his previous activities as a banker.
   He declined to specify what advice he gives Jackson, but said
their relationship began during Jackson's 1984 White House bid.
   The relationship demonstrates how the candidate who ran under an
anti-establishment banner four years ago now is reaching out for
establishment advice as he tries to craft a more mainstream
campaign and expand his base beyond his core black constituency.
   So far, the gambit seems on course. Jackson has made no
significant gaffes in his campaign _ avoiding the kind of slips
that alienated Jewish voters in 1984 when he used the words
``Hymie'' and ``Hymietown.''
   And he has been winning white votes in far greater numbers than
he did in 1984.
   He also consults at times with such party leaders as Jimmy
Carter, Clark Clifford, and Shirley Chisholm, according to his
press secretary.
   Among Jackson's close advisers is political consultant Ann
Lewis, former Democratic National Committee political director. One
of his biggest boosters among political strategy types, she has
given him pointers on Jewish and women's questions, and campaign
strategy, especially in the many months before he hired a campaign
manager.
   Lewis introduced Jackson to Carol O'Cleireacain, an official of
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
Union who has become a key economic adviser. She was primarily
responsible for conceiving one of Jackson's central economic
themes, a proposal to reinvest corporate pension funds in domestic
jobs programs.
   Democrat William Gray, chairman of the House Budget Committee,
is another Jackson economic adviser.
   On foreign policy matters, Jackson leans on Bob Borosage, who
took a leave from his job as director of the liberal think tank,
Institute for Policy Studies, to advise the campaign and travel
with Jackson; Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., a member of the House
Armed Services Committee; and Jim Zogby, head of the Arab American
Institute.
   Jackson signed up one of California's most powerful
officeholders and savvy black politicians, Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, as his campaign chairman. Another confidant is Walter
Fauntroy, the non-voting House member from the District of Columbia.
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower has endorsed
Jackson and advises him on farm policy. Former New Mexico Gov.
Toney Anaya and Mississippi educator Armando Guitierrez specialize
in Hispanic issues.
   Jackson's most senior aide is Frank Watkins, who met him in
1969. Watkins is devoting himself to analysing and targeting states
and congressional districts.
   One change from 1984 is a semblance of organization in the
Jackson campaign, thanks in large part to campaign manager Gerald
Austin. The 11th-hour addition of Austin last fall gave the
campaign a sense that ``somebody is running the railroad,'' said
Lewis.
   ``He really has provided the structural underpinning to support
Jackson that I don't think Jackson ever had before,'' she said.
   A no-nonsense political operative who managed Gov. Richard
Celeste's campaign in Ohio, Austin is Jewish and said he had been
offended by Jackson's reference to Jews as ``Hymie.'' He confronted
Jackson on the topic before taking the job, and said he accepted
the apology the candidate offered.
   Austin has turned around the campaign's tendency toward
indecisiveness, say some who deal with the campaign. He also
developed Jackson's TV commercials himself.
   A direct mail operation is in place, run by California mail
consultant Mal Warwick. He is getting good results by targeting a
spectrum of Democratic voters, and the mail has become a major
party of fund-raising for the cash poor campaign.

   Yusra al Shiah wrapped her
3-month-old daughter in a ragged blanket and took her nine other
children into the rainy night. An Israeli army bulldozer leveled
their cinderblock house moments later.
   Then the machine clanked along the dirt street in this West Bank
village, eight miles west of Jerusalem, to the home of Ibrahim
Hamed Bedwan.
   Bedwan said he and his wife, parents and nine children were
ordered out. Soldiers piled the furniture in the street and the
bulldozer knocked down the two-story stone building.
   Palestinians have begun to turn on alleged collaborators during
the rebellion that has swept the occupied territories for more than
three months, and the army is demolishing houses in response.
   Leaflets distributed by the Palestine Liberation Organization
have ordered revenge attacks on collaborators. Fellow villagers in
Qabatiyeh lynched a man Feb. 24 who was suspected of aiding the
Israelis and another was stabbed to death last week in the Aqbat
Jaber refugee camp.
   Law in the Service of Man, a human rights group founded by
Palestinian lawyers says the army has knocked down 10 houses since
the first killing.
   Destroying or sealing the houses of those accused of terror
attacks has been a common tactic since Israel captured the West
Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war. The Palestinian rights group said the total has reached more
than 1,300 in the generation of occupation.
   An army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
``Demolishing houses is very effective. It serves as a warning to
everyone in a village not to take action against people they
suspect of working with Israel.''
   People whose homes are razed are not allowed to rebuild them, so
most have resorted to living in tents.
   Among those opposing the policy are the United States,
International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations.
   They denounce it as collective punishment usually imposed
without court review or due process. In most cases, the penalty
does not affect the suspect, who may be dead, jailed or a fugitive
abroad.
   In the case of Bidu, the suspects were a son of Mrs. al Shiah
and two sons of Bedwan. The parents said they did not even know
Ibrahim al Shiah, 17; Nissam Bedwan, 23, and Mohammed Bedwan, 20,
were accused of anything until their houses were bulldozed the
night of March 7.
   Mrs. al Shiah stood weeping beside the rubble that had been a
five-room home and said: ``I begged the soldiers `Tell me, for
God's sake, what have we done?''' With her were three small
daughters dressed in plastic sandles and thin, mud-caked dresses on
the chilly morning.
   ``The soldiers wouldn't tell us anything,'' she said. ``They
just took the children from their beds and carried them out of the
house.'' Her husband Khalid is an unemployed handyman.
   Pools of muddy rainwater covered the plastic floors of two white
tents the Red Cross provided. Tattered blankets were piled at the
back of one, which reeked of mildew.
   Discarded in a muddy olive grove were family furniture and
possessions: two smashed beds, a refrigerator on its side, a
mud-caked gas stove, two rain-soaked quilts, pieces of a cabinet, a
child's red boot.
   Metal chairs, pots, pans and a red pillow could be seen buried
in the debris of the house.
   Mrs. al Shiah said the soldiers arrived at about midnight, put
the village's 4,000 residents under curfew and cut off the
electricity before bring in the bulldozer.
   Bedwan said: ``Now everybody in this village feels he is not
safe.'' He stood quietly at the site of the 10-room home he had
built over a period of 20 years. All that remained was part of one
wall, painted bright pink.
   Felicia Langer, an Israeli lawyer who represents Palestinians,
said leveling houses ``punishes people who are not accused of any
offense, much less guilty.''
   She says it violates the 1949 Geneva Convention on treatment of
civilians in occupied zones, which forbids destruction of property
as a punishment or deterrent.
   Israel's Supreme Court has ruled the practice legal under
emergency regulations issued in 1945 by the British administration
governing Palestine at the time. Those regulations have been the
basis for several extraordinary measures, including censorship.

   The nation's trade deficit widened slightly in
January to $12.4 billion after two months of sharp improvements,
the Commerce Department said today.
   The excess of imports over exports was up from the $12.2 billion
deficit in December.
   Exports, which had propelled improvement in November and
December, fell by 10 percent in January to $22.3 billion.
   The Reagan administration said the figures are better than they
appear at first glance.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called it ``an
excellent report.'' He said that ``in the last three months, we
have seen a dramatic drop in the trade deficit.''
   ``There was a seasonal decline in exports, which have dropped in
January every year of this decade,'' said Commerce Secretary C.
William Verity in a statement. Overall, he said, the figures
``confirm the improving trend'' of the past few months.
   ``There is obviously a long way to go to eliminate the trade
deficit. But we are on the right track,'' Verity said.
   Private analysts generally agreed that the January figures
should not be read as an indication of a worsening trade balance _
and noted that January's figure, although higher than December, was
an improvement from both the $13.2 billion November deficit and the
record $17.6 billion October shortfall.
   ``We tend to be very impatient and all expect dramatic
improvements every month. But the trade numbers are very time
consuming to change,'' said Jay Goldinger, chief economist for
Capital Insight, a Los Angeles brokerage house. ``It's a large
vessel and it can't move that quickly. But I believe the ship
continues to travel in the right direction.''
   Analysts had expected a deterioration of the trade balance in
January, noting that exports are traditionally down in that month.
   However, imports also fell in January, by 6 percent to $34.8
billion.
   Thus, the deficit for the month _ eagerly followed by financial
markets _ was somewhat better than most analysts had expected.
   ``It's hard for me to see how we can repeat the same magnitude
of growth in exports that we had in the two previous months,'' said
Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company Economic
Advisers Ind.
   Exports had incrased 9.4 percent in November and 4.2 percent in
December to record levels.
   Analysts claim that the overall trade deficit is shrinking, but
that improvements will be agonizingly slow with many setbacks along
the way _ like January's.
   Still, the fact that imports were down was viewed as a bright
spot in the report.
   The deficit with Japan _ the country with which this nation runs
its largest deficit _ fell by 17.6 percent in January to $3.9
billion, the lowest one-month level since December 1986.
   One major category of imports from Japan _ new automobiles _
registered a 19.5 percent drop in January, to $1.6 billion.
   And the nation even showed its first surplus in nearly three
years with Britain in January, exporting $75 million more than it
imported.
   Despite the drop in January exports, manufacturing industry
leaders have said that recent gains in exports point to a genuine
boom, due in large part to a weaker dollar _ now worth just half
its value of three years against other key currencies.
   A weaker dollar makes U.S. goods cheaper abroad and foreign
products more expensive at home.
   The trade deficit with Canada increased to $1.12 billion from
$632.8 million in December.
   The deficit with Western Europe declined to $1.33 billion from
$2.73 billion.
   The deficit with the newly industrialized countries of Asia _
Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong _ was up to $2.92
billion, from $2.48 billion in December.
   The deficit with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries rose to $1.03 billion from $887.2 million.
   The trade figures, unlike many other government economic
statistics, are not adjusted to remove recurring seasonal effects,
like the post-Christmas dip in exports.
   Because of this, many analysts claim the monthly trade reports
can often be misleading _ even though they are closely watched in
financial markets.
   Beginning with April, the Commerce Department will seasonally
adjust its trade figures.
   Despite anticipated month-to-month fluctuations, most observers
suggest that the overall trade balance definitely is beginning to
improve. And, as import prices rise further because of the
lower-valued dollar, the gap is likely to shrink even more.
   ``The trend has changed, but it's not going to happen
overnight,'' said Goldinger.
   Last year the trade deficit reached record dimensions, no matter
how measured. In terms of merchandise trade alone, the shortfall
reached $171.2 billion.
   A broader measure of trade, the ``current account'' deficit,
which also includes investment flows and trade in services, reached
$160.7 billion last year, also a record.
   The Commerce Department released details on the current account
deficit earlier this week.
   However, both sets of figures _ merchandise trade and current
account _ showed improvements in the final three months of 1987.

   The Tokyo District Court sentenced 11 members of a
radical leftist group Thursday to prison terms ranging from three
to eight years for an attack on a downtown railway station three
years ago.
   Minoru Kajii was sentenced to eight years, while the other 10
received sentences ranging from three to five years, said a court
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The 11 have been identified as members of the Chukaku-ha, or
Middle Core Faction, Japan's most active extremist group.
   They were arrested after attackers set fire to the Asakusabashi
station in downtown Tokyo on Nov. 29, 1985, when saboteurs also cut
telecommunications lines and cables controlling railway signals at
various places across Japan.
   The coordinated attacks paralyzed operations of the then
government-run Japan National Railways, affecting about 6 million
commuters.
   The radicals were believed to have acted in sympathy with former
rail employees who were protesting government plans to turn the
debt-ridden railway network into a private company. The railroad
turned private in April 1987.

   Authorities credit the first joint
U.S.-Chinese investigation for breaking up a drug ring that
smuggled seven pounds of heroin into the United States in dead
goldfish hidden in shipments of live fish.
   Three men were arrested in San Francisco, five in the People's
Republic of China and one in Hong Kong, the Drug Enforcement
Administration said.
   Chinese authorities on March 9 discovered the heroin-laden fish
in a shipment destined for the Golfish Aquarium in San Francisco,
the DEA said. The Chinese alerted U.S. officials and seized the
heroin.
   Authorities then sewed about 11 ounces of heroin back into some
of the fish, placed them into each of 20 boxes containing 50 to 60
live fish and sent them on their way to San Francisco with radio
beacons attached to the boxes.
   Two men picked up the boxes and delivered them to the business
where agents arrested three men Friday after getting a signal the
boxes had been opened. The heroin had been inside condoms in the
fish, the DEA said.
   The agency said it was the first cooperative investigation of
its kind.
   The heroin, believed to be pure, is worth up to $700,000
wholesale, said Tom Sheehan, assistant special agent in charge of
the DEA's office here.

   The University of California today began
tearing down an abandoned house following a day of confrontations
between rock-throwing squatters and baton-wielding police.
   A crane crumpled the roof and walls of the house a day after
more than 350 protesters rampaged through the neighborhood south of
the university setting trash fires and battling helmeted police in
the worst clashes since 1986 anti-apartheid confrontations, the
university said.
   ``The house was a continuing hazard and a target for street
attacks,'' said university spokesman Ray Colvig. ``Rather than have
repeated attacks we decided to take it out.''
   University police said the demonstrators are no longer occupying
property and have dispersed.
   The protests Wednesday started after University of California
police evicted about 35 activists for the homeless from a house
owned by UC-Berkeley. Protesters rampaged up side streets, knocking
over garbage cans, setting trash fires and breaking the window on a
police car.
   Later in the day, protesters tried to lunge through city police
barricades in an unsuccessful attempt to take back the off-campus
house.
   The protesters contended that the three-story house, taken over
by squatters March 9, should not stand vacant when the city has 800
to 1,600 homeless people. The school ordered the eviction after the
city fire marshal Tuesday declared the house a fire hazard, said
spokesman Tom Debley.
   The school plans to demolish the house to make way for student
housing in the next few days, Debley said.

<HEAD>After Five-Year Break, U.S. Has Ambassador in Poland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Career diplomat John R. Davis presented
his credentials Thursday as U.S. ambassador to Poland, ending a
five-year period in which Washington had no top-ranked envoy here
following the imposition of martial law.
   Davis, who had been serving as charge d'affaires in Warsaw,
formally became ambassador at a ceremony at the government's
Belvedere Palace, where he was received by Kazimierz Barcikowski,
vice-president of the Council of State.
   Reviewing relations with Poland prior to the ceremony, Davis
applauded Polish steps toward economic and political reform and
expressed hope for further progress in the area of human rights.
   The situation between the two countries has been ``unnaturally
strained,'' in recent years, he said.
   The United States placed economic sanctions on Poland after the
Dec. 13, 1981, imposition of martial law and the suppression of the
Solidarity independent trade union.
   Soon after martial law, the Polish ambassador to Washington
defected and was not replaced. The former U.S. ambassador, Francis
Meehan, completed his tour in 1983 and Poland rejected the U.S.
nominee to succeed him.
   But following the release of political prisoners in 1986 and the
lifting of the last of the U.S. sanctions last year, relations
gradually warmed, culminating in the September visit of Vice
President George Bush, who was allowed to address the Polish people
on national television.
   During his visit, Bush announced that the two countries had
agreed to exchange ambassadors.
   ``Fortunately Poland proclaimed a policy of national
reconciliation and reform and that has changed the picture here as
it's been implemented slowly,'' Davis said in a meeting March 11
with journalists.
   ``We certainly find ourselves today in a position to support
Polish efforts for economic reform and political reform, and to
applaud the steps they have taken,'' he said. ``We retain our
interest in human rights and hope that progress in this field
continues.''
   Davis said the U.S. economic sanctions were designed to persuade
the government to lift martial law, release political prisoners and
resume the dialogue with Solidarity.
   ``By and large I think those objectives were achieved. I don't
attribute that to the sanctions however, (but to) the decisions
made by the Polish government itself,'' he said.
   Solidarity remains outlawed and Davis said the government still
has not invited the opposition as a group to participate in
national decision-making, although overtures have been made to some
individuals.
   Nevertheless, Davis said, ``The ideals of Solidarity are very
much alive and many of the objectives of Solidarity have been
obtained.''
   The group is ``far from dead. It's remarkably lively considering
the length of time that has gone by and the difficulties of
communicating,'' he said.
   On the day Davis presented his credentials, police around the
country issued warnings to members of Solidarity's National
Executive Commission that they may be imprisoned if they persist in
opposition activities.
   The ambassador said a meeting between Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa and Wojciech Jaruzelski, president and first secretary of
the Polish United Workers (Communist) Party would be of
``tremendous symbolic value, not only here but abroad.''
   He said he hoped the government would consider the possibility,
because it would aid its efforts to enlist broader public support
for its reform program.
   But he praised the progress Poland has made in other areas. He
cited recent publication of an interview by Solidarity adviser
Bronislaw Geremek, the end to jamming of Western radio
Polish-language broadcasts Jan. 1, and relaxation of censorship to
an extent that in domestic affairs it is ``almost non-existent.''

   Thousands of people marched along Fifth Avenue for New York's
parade, green grits awaited celebrants in Georgia, and the Chicago
River flowed green as Americans celebrated a St. Patrick's Day
clouded by violence in Northern Ireland.
   New York's parade drew an estimated 125,000 marchers and more
than a million spectators were expected. It's the biggest of 185
held throughout the United States on the day when everyone is Irish.
   In Savannah, Ga., parade organizers braced for up to 250,000
people to pack the coastal city's downtown Historic District, where
grits and public fountains flow green for the four-hour, three-mile
parade that kicked off this morning.
   The Chicago River also flows green today, thanks to 100 pounds
of biodegradable dye, with 40,000 marchers and 50 floats stepping
out in the Windy City's annual St. Patrick's Day parade.
   In Iowa, environmental officials nixed a plan to dye the
Mississippi River green to coincide with an interstate parade
through the Quad Cities.
   ``It's hard for the department and state Legislature to work as
hard as we did last year to pass a water protection act and to
allow something like that to occur,'' said Larry Wilson, director
of the natural resources department.
   Seattle's parade down Fourth Avenue follows a wide green stripe
laid down in a tradition established by the late John Doyle Bishop,
who used to paint the parade route only to be arrested annually for
defacing the street. In recent years, that problem has been solved
by using green tape.
   Also scheduled was a Mass for Peace in Ireland at Plymouth
Congregational Church.
   In Butte, Mont., the M&M Cigar Store cooked up 1,500 pounds of
corned beef and 15 cases of cabbage, doubled the length of its
30-foot-long bar, and scheduled 14 bartenders to work through the
day and night.
   But the celebrations were clouded by violence at a gravesite in
Belfast, Northern Ireland, where three people were killed and 68
wounded by a Protestant shooting a pistol and throwing grenades at
services for three slain Irish Republican Army guerrillas.
   ``We are very sad to hear the news ... that those people could
not be buried in a peaceful way,'' said Francis Beirne, chairman of
New York City's 227th parade honoring the patrol saint of Ireland.
   ``I would like to feel exuberant. I would like to feel joyful,''
Cardinal John J. O'Connor said in a homily today at St. Patrick's
Cathedral. ``I don't feel that way today. I don't feel like
reviewing a parade. I suspect many of you don't feel like marching
in a parade.''
   But the parade was not canceled in mourning because ``that's not
the Irish way,'' O'Connor said. Citing St. Patrick, Ireland's
patron saint, he said: ``In his name, we will not give up. ... The
parade will go on.''
   New York police said 3,247 officers were called to duty, with
instructions to control public drunkenness around the parade, which
disperses on Third Avenue, home of many festive Irish taverns.
   Some parade-goers only made it as far as halfway to Fifth
Avenue; in the TGIF bar on 51st Street, near-spectators sucked down
green beer and stuck out green toungues at passerbys.
   ``This is the parade!'' shouted one of the revelers.
   Some 185 bands, including the St. Patrick's Independent
Accordion Band from Portadown, Northern Ireland, took part in the
Fifth Avenue march.
   The parade's grand marshal, William Burke, vice president of the
Bank of Ireland, was joined on the reviewing stand by Gov. Mario
Cuomo, Mayor Edward I. Koch and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward.
   This year's parade was dedicated to the U.S. Constitution and
the liberty of one Irish immigrant who has been held here without
bail or trial for over four years.
   James McNamara, parade spokesman, said the march would be
dedicated to ``liberty and justice'' for Joseph Patrick Thomas
Doherty, who fled to the United States after the 1980 IRA killing
of a British army captain in Belfast.
   Doherty has been held pending extradition proceedings.
   The parade was relatively sedate, with only a few pockets of
green-faced and green-headed rowdies visible. Sign-waving
protestors demanded freedom for Joe Doherty and called for the end
of British rule in Northern Ireland.
   ``I don't think the British are doing their job. Their activity
in Northern Ireland is heinous,'' said Russ Anen, of West Caldwell,
N.J. ``I hadn't planned on doing anything until yesterday, and now
somebody has to protest.''
   Said Kevin DeLacey, holding a sign with Doherty's face on it:
``Joe Doherty has never committed a crime in this country. He
shouldn't be held, he should be free.''
   The largely Catholic IRA is waging a guerrilla war to drive the
British from Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, and Protestant
paramilitary groups have grown up to fight against it.

   President Daniel Ortega said today
Nicaragua will not withdraw troops from the area bordering Honduras
and demanded the immediate withdrawal of American troops arriving
in Honduras.
   He called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to deal
with what he called ``one more escalation of the war against
Nicaragua.''
   American troops began arriving in Honduras today at 10:15 a.m.,
a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. The United States and Honduras had
accused Nicaragua of invading its neighbor in pursuit of Contra
rebels.
   The 26 C-141 planes carrying about 3,200 U.S. troops were
arriving every 30 minutes at Palmerola air force base, the main
center of U.S. military operations in Honduras.
   Military officials in Honduras said Honduras troops continued to
surround about 2,000 Nicaraguan troops who they said entered the
country. Nicaraguan defense officials denied their troops crossed
into Honduras.
   Ortega, speaking at a news conference before a meeting with 14
opposition parties, called the U.S. troop movement ``a dangerous
act'' and said the United States was trying ``to use the Honduran
army to save the Contra forces.''
   Ortega earlier warned the nation that U.S. forces may invade
Nicaragua to save Contra rebels, whom he said were driven into
Honduras by Sandinista troops.
   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Nicaraguan soldiers
were withdrawing from the Honduran border region and that the
arrival of U.S. troops may damage government-Contra cease-fire
talks.
   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of the Foreign Ministry,
told NBC's ``Today'' that Nicaraguan troops engaged in cross-fire
along the border but did not enter Honduras.
   ``We've been engaged in a routine military operation designed to
push the Contras back across the border where they came from, in
Honduran territory. That operation reached the border; there was
firing at the border; there's been a cross-fire and there's been
fighting alongside the border,'' Bendana said.
   ``The operations have succesfully been concluded, and we don't
plan to stay along the border region. In fact, this deescalation
has already begun,'' he said.
   But Honduras military officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said today that about 4,000 Honduran soldiers were
surrounding about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers and had been since late
Wednesday.
   The sources said the entire Honduran military was on alert. They
said
   the Sandinista soldiers had been in the border province of
Olancho, east of Tegucigalpa, for 24 hours when Honduran troops
encircled them Wednesday.
   Bendana said the government had called for the United Nations
and Organization of American States to visit the area of fighting
to ``establish what the facts are end these accusations.''
   He said the deployment of American soldiers ``bodes ill'' for
cease-fire talks scheduled Monday in Nicaragua but ``makes the
negotiations more urgent. We are bent on having the cease-fire
talks begin on Monday once again.''
   The government took control of all radio stations and broadcast
that Nicaraguan troops were being mobilized throughout the country
Wednesday. The stations also broadcast revolutionary music.
   Ortega told reporters: ``We are calling on the Nicaraguan public
to be alert, to be in combat readiness, ready to repel, resist,
defeat whatever aggression from the United States.''
   Ortega has neither confirmed nor denied that Nicaraguan soldiers
crossed into Honduran territory, but Defense Ministry spokeswoman
Maj. Rosa Pasos denied that Sandinista troops did so.
   In a letter to Reagan released by the White House, Honduras
President Jose Azcona Hoyo said his government had ordered its
armed forces ``to repulse'' the Sandinista troops and asked for U.S
military assistance.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater in Washington said the
U.S. soldiers were to carry out training exercises and be ``a
signal to the governments and the people of Central America.''
   Palmerola air force base is about 125 miles west of the border
and 40 miles northwest of the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. The
base is just south of the town of Comayagua.
   The Contras have maintained secret bases along the
Honduras-Nicaragua border from which they have staged attacks on
Nicaragua in their 6-year-old war to overthrow the Sandinistas.
   Ortega said on Wednesday that Sandinista troops had pushed about
2,000 Contra soldiers across the Rio Coco into Honduras in a major
offensive the began March 6, the largest this year.
   The Contras have said they have 6,000 of their rebels inside
Nicaragua, out of a total force of 10,000. Most of the 2,000
Contras reportedly pushed into Honduras had been fighting in
Nicaragua's central Chontales province.
   Nicaragua's Defense Ministry previously said the offensive
involved about 6,000 Sandinista troops in central and northwestern
Nicaragua. The Sandinista total military strength of 75,000,
including reserves and militias, is by far the largest in Central
America.
   Ortega said the rebels have suffered 400 casualties, including
92 dead. He said 34 soldiers of the Sandinista army, which is
supplied and trained by Cuba and the Soviet Union, were killed and
68 wounded.

<HEAD>Late Nazi Leader Buried Seven Months After Suicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WUNSIEDEL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nazi leader Rudolf Hess was
buried in his family's plot Thursday, seven months after his
suicide in a West Berlin prison. Police stood guard at the cemetery
to prevent any disturbances.
   Hess' burial was postponed last August after Nazi sympathizers
began gathering at the graveyard in Wunsiedel in northern Bavaria.
   ``Germany was his life,'' read the inscription on a large
bouquet of flowers left at the gravesite.
   The former deputy of Adolf Hitler hanged himself at age 93 on
Aug. 17 in Spandau prison. He was the last imprisoned leader of
Nazi Germany.
   Hess' final wish was to be buried at the family plot in
Wunsiedel, in northern Bavaria. But after the sympathizers began
massing, his family decided to bury Hess temporarily at a secret
location.
   The family had kept secret the time and date of Thursday's
burial at Wundsiedel until it was over.
   The Wunsiedel cemetery was temporarily sealed off and police
officers stood guard to prevent any disturbances, said police
spokesman Rainer Meier.
   Witnesses who later spoke to The Associated Press on the
condition of anonymity said Thursday's service was videotaped.
Hess' widow, Ilse, has been in failing health for years and the
witnesses said she was not present.
   Among those attending were the former Nazi leader's son,
Wolf-Ruediger Hess, and his wife, Andrea, according to funeral home
director Charlotte Koerzdoerffer.
   Ms. Koerzdoerffer told the AP that about a dozen people attended
the burial. ``He was buried quietly and quickly,'' she said.
   Meier said police had been informed of the burial well in
advance and that authorities were able to ``take appropriate
measures.''
   He said he did not know where Hess' body had been before
Thursday's burial.
   About half a dozen elderly people strolled near Hess' grave
later Thursday.
   ``He should be left in peace,'' said a woman in her 70s. She
declined to give her name.
   As another elderly couple walked up to view the grave, the woman
muttered: ``After all these years he's home.''
   Hess' grave was covered with green ivy and several bouquets of
flowers, including a large yellow one with a white ribbon.
   Inscribed on the ribbon in bold gold lettering was the name
``Rudolf Hess,'' and the words ``Deutschland war sein Leben''
(Germany was his life).
   Two policemen standing by their vans declined to discuss why
they had been posted there. A typewritten sign encased in plastic
and tied to the cemetery gate said that taking photographs in the
cemetery was not allowed without the permission of the management.
   ``Demonstrations in the cemetery are banned,'' the sign also
said.
   At the Nuremberg War Crimes trial, Hess was found guilty of
``preparing and waging an aggressive war.'' The court sentenced him
to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
   Hess had been the only inmate in Spandau prison since 1966. He
was nearly blind at the end of his life and spent most of the day
in his cell.
   He had been imprisoned since 1941, when he parachuted into
Scotland in a bizarre, self-proclaimed bid to end World War II.
   After his death, dozens of neo-Nazis converged on Wunsiedel, to
show their support for the dead Nazi.
   Wunsiedel, a town of 10,200 people nestled in rolling hills 11
miles from the Czech border, is known for fine porcelain.

   Israeli warplanes divebombed a Palestine
Liberation Organization base in Druse-held territory above Beirut
on Thursday in the deepest air raid into Lebanon this year.
   Police said one guerrilla was killed and another was wounded
along with his 2-year-old son. It was Israel's third air strike
against Palestinian targets in Lebanon since January.
   The air strike came a day after guerrillas in south Lebanon
fired Soviet-made Katyusha rockets into northern Israel, shattering
windows and damaging citrus trees. No casualties were reported.
   The new assault was mounted by six Israeli fighter-bombers,
demolishing a two-story building used as a base by the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine with four direct shell hits,
police said.
   The Moscow-oriented front, headed by Nayef Hawatmeh, is one of
the eight factions making up Yasser Arafat's PLO.
   A red Mercedes-Benz was seen buried in the rubble of the
stricken base in Aynab in the Chouf Mountains overlooking Beirut's
international airport. The base is just eight miles from Beirut.
   Palls of black smoke billowed from the target and police said
all traffic at the airport was suspended for 15 minutes.
   The sound of explosions could be heard across the city as the
howling jets criss-crossed the skies, drawing anti-aircraft fire
from guerrilla positions.
   Pilots released balloons to deflect heat-seeking, shoulder-fired
SAM-7 missiles unleashed by guerrillas. White puffs of smoke dotted
the sky around the planes, but none was hit.
   Police said the jets staged repeated mock attacks on Palestinian
bases in nearby Chemlan, Bayssour and Kabr Shmoun in the 10-minute
raid, sending hundreds of villagers as well as guerrillas diving
for cover.
   But there were no bombing sorties against bases in those
villages of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command and the Fatah-Uprising, both at odds with
Arafat.
   The Israeli army command said the targets had ``served as bases
for planning and launching attacks against Israel.''
   ``All our planes returned safely and the pilots reported the
destruction of the targets,'' a short Israeli statement said.
   The guerrilla who was killed was standing sentry outside the
base when the jets struck at Aynab, said the front's Chouf
commander, who goes by the nom de guerre of Abu Raad.
   He said the wounded child, who was identified only as Mohammed,
suffered wounds in the head from flying glass shards. His father,
who is a front fighter, was injured in the face and waist.
Mohammed's mother was not hurt.
   One guerrilla crawled out of the debris unharmed. He stood over
the rubble, flashing the ``V'' for victory sign with one hand and
brandishing a Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifle with the other.
   Abu Raad said the casualties were low because the PLO had
ordered all guerrillas in Lebanon to brace for air attacks in
retaliation for Palestinian riots against Israel's occupation in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The violence began Dec. 8.
   Israeli warplanes raided targets near Sidon, 25 miles south of
Beirut on Jan. 2 and March 12. Police said 25 people were killed
and 40 wounded in the two attacks.

<HEAD>Raising of funds snowballs to get replacement for polar bear shot
a zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A campaign to replace a polar bear killed
by police at Vilas Park Zoo has drawn $50,000 in contributions, not
counting a company's offer to cover the full cost of one bear,
officials say.
   ``It's really unbelievable,'' zoo director David Hall said
Wednesday.
   The zoo's only polar bear, Chief, was shot and later destroyed
by police Sunday after a man with a history of mental problems
climbed into the cage and was injured by the animal. The man, who
authorities won't identify, sustained a head wound and is in a
mental health facility pending a committment hearing.
   Radio station WMGN reported raising $27,700 on Wednesday, when
it broadcast live from the zoo all day. In addition, the zoo has
gotten direct donations of about $17,000, including two quarters
ttaped to an index card and several dollar bills tucked inside a
child's drawing of a bear, Hall said.
   The Wisconsin State Journal said it had received checks and cash
amounting to $2,400 through donations to a ``Bring a Polar Bear
Back to Our Zoo'' fund.
   The Rayovac Corp., a Madison-based battery manufacturer, pledged
to cover the entire cost for one bear. ``We just decided that this
thing has great support from the community,'' spokesman John
Daggett said.
   Hall said he is hoping to obtain a pair of bears but, even if
they are found, the money raised will more than cover the expense.
He estimated the cost of a polar bear at $10,000 to $15,000. A
young, mating pair would cost an additional $20,000 to $30,000.
   But Hall said finding polar bears for the zoo may prove to be a
much harder task than raising the money. ``We're working on it, but
they're a difficult animal to acquire.''
   Polar bears in the wild are endangered, and records from zoos in
the United States and Europe indicate only eight were born in
captivity in 1986.
   ``Finding a mate the same age is not an easy task,'' Hall added.
``If we can't get a cub, we'll try for an older animal.''
   Money left over will go to the construction of the new Vilas Zoo
Education Building, which will cost about $450,000.

   Three-time Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race
winner Susan Butcher is shooting for a fourth victory next year,
saying she can whittle a day off her record time to cover the 1,150
mile-course in just 10 days.
   ``I think it can be done, and I want to be the one to do it,''
she said.
   Butcher left her nearest competitor miles behind on the
windblown Bering Sea coast Wednesday night to breeze into the
record books with her third straight victory.
   The 33-year-old musher charged down Front Street in this old
gold mining town at 8:42 p.m. (AST) Wednesday. She covered the
storm-wracked course from Anchorage to Nome in 11 days, 11 hours,
and 41 minutes.
   Her elapsed time _ the actual time on the course minus the time
spent on mandatory breaks _ set a record for the race's longer,
more arduous northern route. She broke her own record set in 1986.
And last year she set the record for the southern route.
   ``It means a lot to me to win three years in a row,'' said the
flushed and perspiring musher. ``But the win doesn't mean as much
to me as knowing the dogs were able to do it.''
   Race officials presented her dog team's leaders, Granite and
Tolstoy, with wreaths of plastic yellow roses. They said real roses
would have wilted quickly in the 10-degree temperature fanned by
30-mph winds.
   The dogs, ice hanging from their muzzles, appeared perplexed by
the glaring television lights and the press of the crowd chanting
``Susan, Susan.''
   She was met by her husband, Dave Monson, who won the 1,000-mile
Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race earlier this month.
   Butcher received $30,000 for winning, down from last year's top
prize of $50,000. The financial problems of the race committee
during the past year caused her winning check last year to bounce,
although she eventually collected all her money.
   Butcher held an unthreatened lead since Tuesday, when she blew
by Martin Buser 171 miles from Nome.
   She said she would be back for the 17th annual Iditarod next
year, but added she might give up the 200- and 300-mile
intermediate races she ran this year.
   ``It's been a long year,'' she said.
   Only one other musher, Rick Swenson, has ever won the race four
times. Butcher and Swenson are the only ones in 16 years ever to
win more than once.

<HEAD>Jury Sees 126 Kilograms Of Cocaine</HEAD>

   The jury in the cocaine-smuggling
trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas got its first look at a large amount
of cocaine Thursday _ 126 kilograms, worth $6.3 million.
   Lehder, 38, a reputed Colombian drug lord, is on trial on
charges he and others conspired to bring 3.3 tons of cocaine into
the United States from Colombia via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   The 277 pounds of cocaine, brought into court on a cart covered
with a sheet, was seized on March 5, 1980, from a large safe at a
Miami-area stash house, according to court testimony.
   Extra drug agents were in the courtroom when the cocaine was
displayed. The halls outside the courtroom were cleared as the cart
was wheeled to and from the chamber.
   Richard Crawford, a federal drug agent with the New York drug
enforcement task force, displayed a two-kilo package that carried
the initials ``C-I-A.''
   Crawford said he came to Miami in February 1980 to trace the
source of cocaine coming into the New York area.
   In arguments earlier this week over the admissability of the
cocaine as evidence, U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle said the
cocaine would be linked to Lehder through testimony and documents.
   In 1980, Tulio E. Ayerbe was arrested in connection with the
seizure, one of the largest in U.S. history.
   Defense attorneys had argued that the cocaine was not tied to
Lehder and that its admission was ``irrelevant and prejudicial.''
   The government has said it can tie the Miami cocaine to Lehder
through car rental records and because the warehouse it was
delivered to was used by one of Lehder's business fronts.
   Merkle has claimed the cocaine shown the jury was part of a
500-kilogram shipment from Colombia that was flown to Reidsville,
Ga., by Lehder pilots Ed Ward and Gregory Von Eberstein in February
1980 and then driven to Fort Lauderdale by Paul Alexander.
   Alexander testified earlier this week that he delivered the
cocaine to a Lehder employee named Jackie Mowerman. Mowerman took
Alexander's station wagon and returned three hours later in a blue
Ford Mustang, saying there had been problems getting the stash
house opened, Alexander testified.
   Crawford testified Thursday that the Mustang rented by Mowerman
was seen in late February at the Opa-locka warehouse that was used
as the stash house.
   He estimated the cocaine was worth $50,000 a kilogram in 1980.
   This is only the second time in the cocaine-smuggling trial, now
in its 15th week of testimony, that the drug has been displayed in
the courtroom. In December, two kilos seized from a suitcase in
West Palm Beach were shown to jurors.
   Lehder, said to be one of the leaders of the violent Colombian
Medellin cartel, is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged only with being a part of the smuggling conspiracy.

   American infantry and airborne forces began
arriving in Honduras today as the Reagan administration said
outnumbered Contra rebels were holding out against up to 2,000
Nicaraguan soldiers inside Honduras.
   The Sandinista forces ``are not withdrawing at all,'' Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams told reporters after a closed
Capitol Hill briefing.
   Members of Congress in attendance said administration officials
had also painted a picture of more than 1,000 rebels hemmed in at a
base just inside Nicaragua.
   A Pentagon source said the Sandinistas continued to pound the
Contras inside Honduras as well. The source, requesting anonymity,
said that ``the Contra camps are under intense pressure.''
   From Managua, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman said again
today that his nation's troops had not crossed the border and
called on the United Nations and the Organization of American
States to ``establish what the facts are.''
   And Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, while not confirming
that his troops had invaded Honduras, told a news conference that
he would not withdraw his forces stationed near the border until
the U.S. forces left Honduras.
   However, both the Democratic chairman and the Republican vice
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said after a briefing
that Reagan had little choice but to agree to Honduran President
Jose Azcona's request for help.
   The senators, Democrat David Boren of Oklahoma and Republican
William Cohen of Maine, also agreed that the Nicaraguan move was an
staged incursion, not a hot pursuit of fleeing Contras.
   Another lawmaker who was briefed, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said
that ``there has clearly been a penetration'' by Sandinista troops
``in fair numbers'' into Honduras.
   Other Democrats said President Reagan was ``unjustified'' in his
action, had been guilty of ``overreaction'' and called the reports
of an invasion of Honduras ``ridiculous.''
   The American deployment, of 3,200 troops more than 100 miles
from the fighting, was the most dramatic show of U.S. force in the
six-year Nicaraguan war.
   In Managua, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman said again
today that his nation's troops had not crossed the border and
called on the United Nations and the Organization of American
States to ``establish what the facts are.''
   The American forces _ about 2,000 troops in two battalions from
the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C. _ began arriving
shortly after 11 a.m. EST at Palmerola Air Base, about 125 miles
from the reported hostilities, after a three-hour flight. They were
being joined later in the day by two battalions from the 7th
Infantry Divisions at Fort Ord, Calif.
   The 2,000 men from the 82nd Airborne were ``excited,'' said Lt.
Gen. John W. Foss, adding, ``but I would not say they were
nervous.''
   Most of the men, being ferried on a total of 55 transport planes
leaving at 30-minute intervals, were flying directly to Palmerola,
but about 800 would parachute into Honduran territory about 5 miles
away and then move toward Palmerola, said the commander of the 82nd
Airborne, Maj. Gen. Carl Stiner.
   Accompanying the 82nd Airborne troops was a giant C-5 transport
loaded with three light observation helicopters, four Cobra
helicopter gunships, one Blackhawk helicopter, a command vehicle
and ammunition.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Bendana,
interviewed from Managua on the NBC-TV ``Today'' show, said
Nicaraguan forces battling the U.S.-backed Contras had reached the
border with Honduras.
   ``There's been a cross fire and there's been fighting alongside
the border,'' he said, adding that ``the operations have
successfully been concluded and we don't plan to stay in the border
region.''
   Bendana said Nicaragua would fly reporters to the area later in
the day. In addition, he said, ``We've called for an OAS-UN mission
to go to the site and let them establish what the facts are.''
   ``They can go and see for themselves,'' he said. ``Don't take
our word for it.''
   But Secretary of State George P. Shultz, appearing before the
Senate Budget Committee, laid out this scenario:
   _Intelligence efforts detected preparations for a Nicaraguan
drive March 9. First contact between the Sandinistas and Contras
inside Honduras came the next day.
   _On Tuesday, the Contras reported heavy fighting and attacks
from Nicaraguan bombers inside Honduras.
   _On Wednesday, ``we saw a presence of 1,600 to 2,000 Sandinista
troops'' in Honduras. Aiding the Nicaraguan ground forces were
bombers and heavily armed helicopters, he said.
   Shultz laid part of the responsibility for the Contras' dire
straits on the House, which last month voted not to renew aid to
the rebels.
   ``The decision ... to deny aid to the resistance has dealt them
and, in my opinion, the cause of freedom, a very serious blow,'' he
said.
   But the drumbeat of Democratic opposition continued.
   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said, ``I know of nothing that
justifies sending troops'' to Honduras.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., called the U.S. move ``an
overreacton,'' adding, ``I think the notion that there's a real
invasion is just ridiculous.
   ``I think it's a move the president may come to regret because
the spectacle of American troops moving into Central America in
convoy, flying down there, I think is going to remind the American
people of why they don't want this.''
   ``It's an overreaction,'' said Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va. ``We've heard the administration cry, `wolf, wolf,'
before. I don't know when they're crying wolf.''
   Some members of Congress noted that the deployment came as the
administration was making a renewed push for aid for the Contras.
   But Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., interviewed on ``CBS This
Morning,'' said he doubted the events would not change lawmakers'
positions.
   `We're very evenly divided in the House and in the Congress on
aid, and I don't see that fundamentally changing,'' he said.
   Shultz said the United States had dispatched its troops in part
``to get people's attention to what is happening in Central
America'' and to say to the Honduran government, ```We are your
friends. We stand with you.'''
   He also told the committee, ``It's important that people know
the United States will fight.'' But he added that the troops ``are
not there in a shooting capacity. We haven't been asked for that.''
   Some congressional leaders had been briefed by telephone late
Wednesday, but Byrd said today he was still waiting for hard
administration evidence to back up its statements on the Nicaraguan
troop movements.
   U.S. aid to the Contras ran out two weeks ago, and the
administration is hoping the new situation will earn the Contras
greater sympathy in Congress.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. deployment came in response to a request
from Azcona. He said Reagan was briefed on the request about 8 p.m.
EST in his residence and decided to send in U.S. forces.

<HEAD>Deficit Widens To $12.44 Billion In January</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened to
$12.44 billion in January, the government reported Thursday, but
economists said the 1.9 percent increase was too small to cause
alarm.
   Both exports and imports fell _ exports by 10 percent to $22.33
billion and imports by 6 percent to $34.77 billion. The trade
deficit is the difference between the two.
   Analysts said the export drop was expected and happens every
January. But the decline in imports was greeted as good news and a
further indication that the trade balance is slowly improving.
   The Commerce Department said that January's deficit was up from
$12.20 billion in December, but down from those of $13.21 billion
in November and $17.63 billion in October.
   If the January level continued for 12 consecutive months, it
would yield an annual trade deficit of about $149 billion. In 1987,
the merchandise trade deficit was $171.22 billion.
   ``There was a seasonal decline in exports, which have dropped in
January every year of this decade,'' said Commerce Secretary C.
William Verity. ``There is obviously a long way to go to eliminate
the trade deficit. But we are on the right track.''
   Private economists appeared to agree.
   ``We tend to be very impatient and all expect dramatic
improvements every month. But the trade numbers are very time
consuming to change,'' said Jay Goldinger, chief economist for
Capital Insight, a Los Angeles brokerage house. ``It's a large
vessel and it can't move that quickly. But I believe the ship
continues to travel in the right direction.''
   The January report represented a slight setback after two
consecutive monthly improvements and reclaimed some of the gains
won from surging exports at the end of 1987. But there were some
bright spots.
   For instance, the deficit with Japan _ still the largest
single-country imbalance _ fell by 17.6 percent in January to $3.95
billion, its lowest level since December 1986.
   Imports of Japanese cars registered a 19.5 percent drop in
January alone, to $1.62 billion.
   And the nation showed its first surplus in nearly three years
with Britain, with exports overtaking imports by $75 million.
   For all Western Europe, the deficit declined 51 percent, to
$1.33 billion.
   ``This is the first clear evidence that we are rooting out
imported products from Japan and Western Europe,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   While disappointed by January's export figures, Jasinowski said
``the trade numbers are fabulous on the import side.''
   A weaker dollar _ worth roughly 50 percent less now than it was
three years ago against Japanese and European currencies _ is
credited with making U.S. goods more competitive abroad and imports
more costly at home.
   However, the deficit worsened in January with trading partners
who have not seen the same degree of dollar devaluation against
their currencies.
   It was up 77 percent with Canada to $1.12 billion, up 20 percent
with Taiwan to $1.32 billion, up 19 percent with South Korea to
$910.9 million and up 16 percent with the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to $1.03 billion.
   Unlike many other government economic statistics, the monthly
trade figures are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, although
they will be starting with April.
   Because exports always fall after the Christmas season, analysts
suggested that the January figures were misleading and overstated
the actual trade deficit.
   Robert Ortner, under secretary of Commerce for economic affairs,
said that if a seasonal adjustment calculation had been applied to
the January figures, instead of showing a $235 million
deterioration from December, the figures would have shown roughly a
$1 billion improvement.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called it ``an
excellent report.'' He said that ``in the last three months, we
have seen a dramatic drop in the trade deficit. Today's report
continues that trend.''
   However the AFL-CIO argued in a statement: ``The figures are the
reality, and no amount of theorizing can deny them. The U.S. trade
deficit, up over last month, is more than enough to show that
there's a need for a strong trade bill.''
   The report comes several days after the Commerce Department
reported that the current account deficit _ an even broader measure
of the trade balance than the merchandise figures _ increased in
1987 to a record $160.7 billion.
   The current account deficit also includes investment flows and
trade in services.
   In another economic report on Thursday, the Federal Reserve said
that America's factories, mines and utilities operated at 82.4
percent of capacity in February _ the same rate as in January and
December. The level for the three months is the highest operating
rate in more than eight years.

   Following is an excerpt from the majority opinion written by
Justice Hugo Black in Gideon vs. Wainwright, handed down March 18,
1963. (Three justices filed separate concurring opinions):
   ``Governments, both state and federal, quite properly spend vast
sums of money to establish machinery to try defendants accused of
crime. Lawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to
protect the public's interest in an orderly society. Similarly,
there are few defendants charged with crime, few indeed, who fail
to hire the best lawyers they can get to prepare and present their
defenses.
   ``That government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who
have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications
of the widespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are
necessities, not luxuries. The right of one charged with crime to
counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials
in some countries, but it is in ours.
   ``From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions
and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive
safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial
tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law.
This noble idea cannot be realized if the poor man charged with
crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him.''

   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ President Reagan paid a surprise visit to an
Irish pub in a Washington suburb today, joining a noisy,
hand-clapping crowd in singing Irish songs to honor St. Patrick's
Day.
   Reagan sipped beer and munched on corned beef and cabbage at
Ireland's Own, a restaurant and bar, with columnist James J.
Kilpatrick.
   The president, a moderate drinker, left most of the beer in his
glass.
   He joined in singing ``When Irish Eyes are Smiling'' and other
favorites and in clapping to guitar and fiddle music.
   At the end of his stay, Reagan, who like most presidents is
seldom seen handling money, reached into his pocket for some
currency and paid the check.
   After leaving the bar, the president was going the Capitol to
drop in on another St. Patrick's Day gathering hosted by House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.

<HEAD>Taxpayers Voluntarily Paid $84 Billion Less Than They Owed in 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Individuals and businesses voluntarily paid
only 83.2 percent of the federal income taxes they owed last year,
leaving the government with a tax gap of $84.9 billion, the
Internal Revenue Service said Thursday.
   More than half the shortage was attributed to individuals who
file tax returns but fail to report income from moonlighting, a
small business or other legal non-wage sources.
   IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said closing the gap may
require a basic change of attitude among taxpayers in much the same
way, he said, that they came to consider drunken driving
unacceptable.
   ``I think in this country we still have an attitude ... (that)
it's socially acceptable to cut a corner here and there'' on taxes,
Gibbs told the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee.
   ``We are going to destroy the system'' unless a way is found to
ensure that everyone pays a fair share, said Rep. J.J. Pickle,
D-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee.
   Pickle said the IRS estimate is understated, even for legal
income. He noted the IRS made no effort to estimate the tax loss
from narcotics, prostitution and other illegal sources of income.
   As serious a problem as the $84.9 billion gap represents, Gibbs
said, there was good news:
   _The 1987 gap is $30 billion less than the IRS forecast in 1983
that it would be. Gibbs attributed the decline to new tax laws,
improved data collection, lower estimates of cheating on tips and
capital gains, and a decision not to count $7 billion in taxes that
were acknowledged but not paid.
   _The rate of voluntary compliance, which had dropped to 81.1
percent in 1986, rose last year to 83.2 percent, virtually the same
level as 1973. Gibbs said compliance by individuals and
corporations is expected to continue rising through 1992, but still
remain below 85 percent.
   Because of a growing economy and inflation, the dollar amount of
the tax gap will keep going up, Gibbs said. The gap, which totaled
$28 billion in 1973, is expected to climb to $87 billion this year
and almost $114 billion in 1992.
   The tax gap includes money that eventually may be collected by
IRS enforcement procedures. The IRS collected about $475 billion in
corporate and individual income taxes last year.
   Inflated wages and economic growth will offset part of the
tax-gap decline that could be expected because of tougher
enforcement provisions enacted over the last several years, as well
as the lower tax rates and smaller number of deductions that
resulted from the big tax overhaul enacted in 1986.
   ``To the extent that, under new law, a subtraction from income
is no longer allowed, a taxpayer cannot overstate it on the tax
return,'' the report reasons. ``This reduces non-compliance.
Moreover, because rates at which individual incomes are taxed were
reduced, the tax gap associated with any given amount of unreported
income fell.''
   The biggest single cause of the tax gap is the underreporting of
income by individuals who file returns. That cost more than $48
billion last year, or almost 57 percent of the gap. Almost $17
billion of that income was from non-farm businesses conducted as
sole proprietorships. Another $7.7 billion was attributed to such
``informal suppliers'' as moonlighting carpenters and roadside
vendors.
   Overstatement of individual deductions accounted for 4.1 percent
of the 1987 tax gap, or $3.5 billion; claiming too many personal
exemptions cost $2 billion.
   Another $7 billion of the gap was blamed on people with taxable
earnings who failed to file a return. Another $1 billion was lost
to taxpayers who make mathematical errors on their returns.
   Individuals accounted for more than $63 billion of the gap;
corporations, more than $21 billion. Companies with assets of $10
million or more were responsible for three-fourths of the corporate
gap.
   Because of withholding and similar accounting, the IRS said,
individuals who file returns voluntarily report 99.5 percent of
their wages and salaries, 98.4 percent of pension income and almost
95 percent of interest and dividends. For capital gains the figure
is 88 percent.
   On the other hand, roadside merchants and moonlighting craftsmen
report only 13.1 percent of their earnings.
   Because the 1986 tax overhaul shifted $125 billion in taxes from
individuals to corporations over five years, the IRS projects the
corporate tax gap to rise from nearly $15.6 billion in 1986 to $31
billion in 1992.

   With spring just three days away, the
Sunshine State is shivering, and forecasters say this week's
unseasonable cold _ including some freezing temperatures and
crop-damaging frost _ will be back again next week.
   Overnight lows in North Florida dropped below freezing today for
the second day. But temperatures in Central Florida down to the
Everglades apparently did not dip low enough for a second night of
scattered frost, as predicted.
   The mercury dipped to 25 in Tallahassee, the lowest for March 17
since 28 degrees in 1981. A 53-degree reading in Key West _ the
southernmost city in the contiguous United States _ tied a 1901
mark.
   Agricultural damage from the frost was slight and confined
primarily to fragile, nearly harvest-ready winter sweet corn and
other vegetables in western Palm Beach.
   R.C. Hatton Inc., near Belle Glade, lost 420 of 2,800 acres of
sweet corn, worth about $189,000, a company spokesman said. Hatton
flew three helicopters over the crop Tuesday night, circulating
warmer air.
   About 3,000 acres of sweet corn, a fourth of Belle Glade's crop,
suffered some damage, said Sam Scruggs of Hugh Branch Inc.
   Palm Beach County's corn production was almost $33 million last
season.
   Patchy frost in Immokalee, west of Palm Beach, caused some
scattered damage to peppers, tomatoes and other winter crops, said
Chuck Eggleton, meteorologist at the weather service's agriculture
forecasting office.
   But temperatures weren't cold enough for long enough to harm
Florida's citrus industry.

   Big Ike, a pecan tree believed to be one
of the world's largest, will escape a chainsaw after all, its owner
says.
   ``It seemed I would lose Big Ike and I said, `God, if there's a
door, let me find it,''' Dewayne Davis, on whose family farm near
Corinth the 150-year-old tree stands, said this week.
   Davis has organized a prayer and letter-writing campaign to save
the tree, which way in the way of a proposed widening of U.S. 45.
Finally, a professor at Mississippi State University notified him
that a team of forestry and horticulture experts could move the
tree to safety, 50 yards away.
   John D. Hodges, a professor of forestry at Mississippi State and
a member of the team that will move the tree, said chances were
``probably no better than 50-50'' that the tree will survive the
move. No date for it has been set.
   Highway Departent officials determined earlier this year that it
would cost too much for them to move the tree, which is 210 inches
around at its base.
   Davis, who now lives in Richmond, Va., said he read a newspaper
account earlier his week about a 200-year-old magnolia in Virginia
that was being moved, so he called Mississippi State and told his
story to Rodney Foil, vice president of forestry and agriculture at
the university in Starkville.
   Foil agreed to recruit a team to supervise the move.
   Davis said fourth-graders in Kossuth adopted the tree and others
wrote letters to Gov. Ray Mabus urging him to save Big Ike.
   ``Youths at my church in Richmond prayed and more than 150
children have formed what we call the Big Ike Bunch,'' Davis said.
``We have a newsletter and a Big Ike T-shirt.''

   The Irish Republican Army
buried a guerrilla Thursday alongside the trampled graves and
tumbled tombstones where a Protestant gunman killed three people
and wounded 68 at an IRA funeral a day earlier.
   Wearing shamrocks and green or black armbands on a somber St.
Patrick's Day, 3,000 mourners gathered in the Roman Catholic
Milltown cemetery to bury Kevin McCracken yards from where the
gunman opened fire and hurled grenades on Wednesday.
   At St. Patrick's Day services, Catholic leaders appealed for
calm amid fears the cemetery killings will herald new and prolonged
sectarian clashes. For the second day, police reported sporadic
rioting and car burning in Belfast's Catholic districts Thursday.
   Police kept a discreet distance while funeral speakers, standing
amid tombstones knocked over in Wednesday's pandemonium, renewed
charges that British authorities and Northern Ireland's mainly
Protestant police force colluded in the attack.
   ``Britain attacked us yesterday ... Let Britain take a lesson
from our presence here today: You can never defeat us,'' declared
Jim McAllister, a leading member of the outlawed IRA's political
wing, Sinn Fein.
   A British army patrol shot McCracken, 33, on Monday night in
Belfast after he fired on them, the army said.
   Before his funeral, three hooded IRA gunmen fired three volleys
_ the movement's traditional salute to its dead _ in a side street
near his home. They fired over a makeshift shrine of his photograph
surrounded by wreaths.
   Firing the volleys in a side street avoided attracting police
action at the funeral. Britain has banned paramilitary displays by
both Catholic and Protestant groups in the province.
   Black flags fluttered from the windows of row houses in West
Belfast's cramped streets as McCracken's coffin, topped with the
Irish tricolor flag and his guerrilla insignia of a black beret and
gloves, was driven to Milltown.
   Gerry Adams, president of the outlawed IRA's legal political
wing, Sinn Fein, said the Royal Ulster Constabulary's denial of
complicity in Wednesday's attack ``rings hollow.'' He claimed some
police officers were also members of Protestant paramilitary groups.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, Britain's top official in
the province, described the charges of police complicity as a
``disgraceful allegation.''
   Police said a Protestant, Michael Stone, who allegedly mounted
Wednesday's gun and grenade attack with an accomplice, remained
under armed guard in the hospital. The accomplice, who was not
identified, also was in police custody.
   Stone was grabbed by youths near the cemetery and badly beaten
before police arrived.
   Police can hold the two for a week without charge under
anti-terrorist laws.
   The gunman opened fire Wednesday from behind a gravestone as the
coffins of three guerrillas shot March 6 by British commandos in
Gibraltar were being lowered into a single grave.
   The IRA said one of the three men shot and killed during the
Milltown, 30-year-old Kevin Brady, was an IRA member.
   Eight of the people injured in the attack remained hospitalized,
including four who were in serious condition.
   The Ulster Defense Association, an umbrella organization of
Protestant vigilante groups, was quoted as saying Stone was turned
down for membership a year ago.
   ``He was just too extreme,'' said a UDA spokesman, who spoke on
condition he was not identified. ``There was no way a man like that
could have been disciplined.''
   Catholics who packed a St. Patrick's Day rally in Casement Park
soccer stadium Thursday hung a poster with Stone's picture and the
word ``Wanted,'' along with his name, address and telephone number.
   ``This St. Patrick's Day we are in mourning,'' Adams told the
crowd.
   More than 5,000 people marched behind pipe and drum bands to the
rally to protest the jailing in Britain of six Irishmen convicted
of bombing a Birmingham pub in 1974, killing 21 people. They have
long maintained they are innocent.
   Black streamers fluttered from the drums as the parade wound
through streets dotted with shells of cars burned in overnight
rioting.
   Sinn Fein said Brady, too, will likely be buried at Milltown,
the graveyard of dozens of guerrillas killed in the IRA's nearly
20-year bomb and bullet campaign to end British rule.
   The IRA aims to unite Northern Ireland, nearly two-thirds
Protestant, with the Catholic Republic of Ireland under a socialist
adminsitration.

   Israel began its first major trials on
Thursday of soldiers charged with brutality in the Arab rebellion,
and Palestinians wounded an Israeli with gunfire for the first time
since the violence began Dec. 8.
   Israeli warplanes raided Palestinian guerrilla bases in the
mountains south of Beirut, and newspapers said Secretary of State
George P. Shultz may return to the Middle East early next month to
promote the U.S. peace plan. The raid came a day after rockets
landed in northern Israel, causing light damage.
   Authorities increased restrictions in the occupied territories,
which already include travel bans and a cut-off of telephone
service to the outside. A military official said must get approval
to bring $1,000 or more from neighboring Jordan, where most hold
citizenship and have family.
   The rules are intended to hamper the Palestine Liberation
Organization in organizing and financing the protests.
   Trials beginning Thursday involved the burial alive of four
Arabs by an army bulldozer Feb. 5 in Kfar Salem, a West Bank
village, and the beating Feb. 24 of two Palestinians near Nablus,
which was photographed by a CBS News crew.
   Neighbors soon rescued the buried Palestinians. The beating was
televised around the world and aroused international protest.
   Several weeks after trouble began in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the army introduced a policy of beating rioters as an
alternative to firing live ammunition. At least 100 Palestinians
have been killed in more than three months of violence, and
hundreds wounded.
   Yair Nissimi and Dror Segen-Cohen, both army privates, pleaded
guilty in the burial case to reduced charges of shameful behavior.
The plea bargain would give Nissimi 2{ months in jail and
Segen-Cohel two months, and both would be placed on probation.
   A three-judge panel is to rule March 29 on whether to accept the
arrangement.
   Sgt. Maj. Charlie Danino pleaded innocent to assault and
unbecoming conduct, and is expected to argue that he was not at the
scene.
   Mustafa Hamdan, one of those buried, said of the plea bargain:
``They buried four people alive. If an Arab did that they would
have given him 200 years.''
   Defense lawyer Josef Danai said in court the burial was ``an
instance of letting off steam, revenge and deterrence'' by soldiers
in difficult circumstances.
   ``We have to view this in its proper proportion,'' he said.
``After all, what did they do? They spilled a little earth on them.
The tractor driver said an ant could have gotten out of it.''
   Danai said the army was sending to the occupied territories
``young boys inexperienced in life who ... are unable to handle
this difficult mission.'' Sgt. Amichai Vaturi, who was at the scene
but is not charged, testified that the Arabs were covered with
about two feet of wet earth but their heads and shoulders were
exposed.
   Hamdan said the heads of three men were covered.
   In the beating case, Sagi Harpaz and Yehuda Angel, army
privates, pleaded innocent to assault and the case was recessed.
   Angel's lawyer, David Ofek, called the defendants scapegoats.
``The orders to soldiers were to break arms and legs of Arab
inciters they capture,'' he said.
   Two other soldiers were sentenced Tuesday to 10 and 21 days in
jail for minor roles in the beating.
   In the Gaza Strip, Arabs armed with a pistol and an assault
rifle shot 44-year-old Israeli contractor Adi Tzabaria several
times in the legs near the Jabaliya refugee camp, said Ilana Ziv,
spokesman for Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon.
   The army confirmed the shooting. It was the first time an
Israeli, civilian or soldier, has been reported hit by Arab gunfire
since the beginning of what Palestinians now call ``the uprising.''
   An Arab truck driver in the same area tried to run down an
Israeli soldier earlier Thursday but he escaped without injury, the
army said.
   Arab reports from Jabaliya said the army fired tear gas and
rubber bullets at 800 schoolgirls who stoned soldiers, raised
Palestinian flags and burned tires.
   Officials of a U.N. clinic said 25 girls were treated for minor
injuries. The camp was placed under curfew.
   Palestine Press Service, an Arab-run news agency, said soldiers
in the West Bank arrested 150 Palestinians overnight in Nablus,
Jenin, Qabitiyeh, Ramallah and Hebron. The army said it was
investigating the report.
   Arab reporters said the army blocked dairy and produce
deliveries to Nablus, Tulkarm and Jericho. An army spokesmen said
the reports were being checked.

<HEAD>Study: Direct Cholesterol Link to Heart Attack Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 25-year study of 1,969 men has shown a
direct link between increased cholesterol in the diet and an
increased risk of a fatal heart attack, researchers said Thursday.
   Many previous studies have shown that too much cholesterol in
the blood raises the risk of dying from a heart attack, but this is
the first study to show convincingly that cholesterol in the diet
can raise blood cholesterol and in turn increase the likelihood of
death from heart attacks, researchers said.
   Furthermore, the study may explain why the incidence of heart
disease is falling in the United States, said the study's author,
Richard Shekelle of the University of Texas School of Public Health
in Houston.
   The men Shekelle studied, workers at a Western Electric Co.
plant in Chicago, had a median intake of 737 milligrams of
cholesterol per day _ roughly the amount in three eggs _ when the
study began.
   Average cholesterol consumption in Americans is now about 400 or
450 milligrams per day, Shekelle said.
   ``Our data are consistent with the idea that this decline in the
intake of cholesterol over the past 25 years may have contributed
to the observed decline in coronary heart disease,'' Shekelle said
at an American Heart Association meeting.
   Heart association figures show a 20 percent drop in coronary
heart disease during the last decade.
   Shekelle's study was praised by other scientists at the meeting.
``There haven't been many studies showing the link between dietary
cholesterol and mortality,'' said Suzanne Haynes of the National
Cancer Institute. ``This is one of the first and it's very
important.''
   Dwayne Reed of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
said, ``We all know that serum (blood) cholesterol is important.
It's going back that one step from serum cholesterol to dietary
cholesterol that's been so important. We've all looked at it, but
we've never found it.''
   Shekelle said his findings, made in collaboration with Jeremiah
Stamler of Northwestern University in Chicago, provide the most
convincing demonstration so far that dietary cholesterol increases
that risk of death from heart disease. He said that several other
studies had suggested such a link.
   In Shekelle's study, men who consumed more than 500 milligrams
of cholesterol per day had a 22 percent higher risk of dying from a
heart attack than did men whose cholesterol intake was low enough
to rank them in the bottom fifth of the group.
   Shekelle and Stamler began following the Western Electric
workers in 1957 and 1958. In 1981, the researchers reported a link
between dietary cholesterol and fatal heart attacks.
   Since then, he said, they have been combing the data to be sure
that those men who consumed higher cholesterol did not have other
dietary abnormalities that were contributing to the increased risk
of fatal heart attacks.
   ``We tried to make that association (between cholesterol and
mortality) go away, and we couldn't do it,'' Shekelle said.
   The researchers found that the link persisted when they
discounted the effects of known risk factors such as high blood
pressure, smoking, alcohol consumption and family history of heart
disease.

   Two gunmen with Irish brogues and wearing

of a Hollywood jewelry store Thursday, then fled with $1 million in
precious gems, police said.
   No one was injured in the robbery at Dolly Don Quixote Jewelers,
Officer Don Lawrence said.
   He added it wasn't immediately known how many people were tied

<HEAD>Iraqi Missile Strikes Tehran, Iran Says It Seized Two Border Towns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq fired a missile into Tehran and
bombed other cities Thursday, and Iran said it seized two Iraqi
border towns despite chemical-bomb attacks. Iran says the Iraqi
attacks killed 28 civilians.
   The renewed missile raid followed an appeal by United Nations
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for a halt in the ``war
of the cities,'' which has raged for more than two weeks apart from
a fragile two-day truce.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi said in Tehran that the
U.N. Security Council was no more than a tool in the hands of the
major powers.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   In Istanbul, two newspapers reported that Premier Turgut Ozal
said Turkey closed its airspace to all military flights from Iran
or Iraq, both neighbors of Turkey.
   The U.S. Defense Department said the 17th Persian Gulf convoy
operation of the year ended Thursday morning. It said the
U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Gas Prince arrived safely off Kuwait,
escorted by the guided-missile frigate USS Simpson.
   The missile strike was reported by the official Iraqi News
Agency, which said Iraq was bombarding ``the nest of evil, the
hideout of the charlatans, because instead of accepting peace they
have chosen the course of aggression.''
   Iraq says it has launched 23 missiles into the Iranian capital
since Sunday, when the ``war of the cities'' reignited after a
two-day truce. Iran has reported firing seven missiles into Baghdad.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said 28 civilians were
killed in the latest missile strike and in Iraqi warplane raids on
four cities. Both sides have reported scores of civilian casualties
since Feb. 29, but neither has given an overall figure.
   The agency also said Iranian forces Thursday fired seven
short-range missiles into Zoubair, an industrial town south of
Basra, and pounded border towns along the front.
   Iran said its forces captured the town of Dojaila, which IRNA
said has a population of 20,000, and Halabja, a town of 70,000
people. The towns are in Sulaymaniyah province 160 miles north of
Baghdad.
   The Iranian agency said 2,500 Iraqi soldiers were killed or
wounded in the fighting Thursday. It gave no breakdown of the dead
and wounded, and the figures could not be independently confirmed.
   The Iraqi agency quoted an unidentified spokesman as denying
there has been any combat in the region and calling the Iranian
claims ``cheap lies.''
   Tehran radio said Iranian combatants had seized 300 square miles
of Iraqi territory in the region, including 102 villages. It said
the prisoners included Maj. Gen. Ali Hussein Obaid al-Algawi,
described as the commander of Iraq's 43rd infantry division.
   The Iranian agency said Iraqi forces used chemical bombs against
Dojaila and Halabja, ``killing many defenseless residents.'' It
said the two towns were ``liberated under heavy bombing raids from
the air by chemical bombs.''
   The state-run agency also reported, without attribution, that
4,000 civilian residents of Halabja were killed when the town was
hit by Iraqi chemical bombs Wednesday. Iraq did not comment on the
claim and it could not be independently confirmed.
   Ozal said the ban on flying through Turkey's airspace applied to
all Iranian or Iraqi planes with military cargo. Turkey maintains
relations with both nations and represents them in each other's
capitals.
   Ozal was quoted by the dailies Sabah and Cumhuriyet.
   Two Iranian cargo planes and two Iraqi cargo planes reportedly
loaded with arms were denied permission to use Turkish airspace a
week ago.

<HEAD>Man Says Fall From Golden Gate Bridge `Lasted Forever'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 29-year-old man who fell 220 feet from
the Golden Gate Bridge while trying to suspend himself in a trash
can is believed to be the first person to survive an accidental
fall from the span.
   ``It seemed like the fall lasted forever,'' Paul Alarab said
from a hospital bed in this town about 30 miles northeast of San
Francisco. ``I was praying for God to give me another chance.''
   There have been 851 known suicides from the 50-year-old bridge,
and only 19 people have survived suicide attempts. Alarab is
believed to be the first to survive an accidental fall.
   ``I have been counting my blessings ever since I fell Sunday
night,'' he said, despite his two broken ribs and collapsed lungs.
   The unemployed salesman said he planned to occupy a 33-gallon
barrel dangling from the bridge by a 60-foot rope to protest the
treatment of the elderly and handicapped. But he slipped while
lowering himself down the rope and hit the bottom girder of the
bridge.
   ``I tried to cling to the girder but I did a flip and continued
sliding down the rope. I hoped to land in the barrel but I missed
and fell head-over-heels, tumbling all the way to the water,'' he
said.
   ``I hit with my head and chest first. I remember hitting the
water, but it knocked me out immediately. I was about 20 feet
underwater when I regained consciousness and started to swim back
to the surface.''
   Alarab said he felt no pain or fear, theorizing, ``the
adrenaline and shock prevented the pain, and I just thought I
didn't want to die like this. I didn't want to hurt my family.''
   No one spotted his plunge, which he said happened about 10 p.m.
Sunday night. Authorities found only the rope and barrel dangling
from the bridge and found a taxi driver who reported dropping a man
off on the bridge with the equipment.
   Alarab said it took two hours to swim to shore through the
strong current. Seven hours later, shivering from the 58-degree
water, he was spotted by a fishing boat and picked up by the Coast
Guard.
   Alarab said he plans to continue his activism for senior
citizens and handicapped, ``but I'll never put my life on the line
again because I feel so lucky to be alive today.''

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright and some fellow
Democratic leaders on Thursday criticized President Reagan's
decision to send some 3,200 troops to Honduras as unjustified and
potentially dangerous, but others in Congress said the president
had little choice.
   ``I know nothing that justifies sending troops,'' said Wright,
D-Texas, who has made himself Reagan's most visible congressional
critic on Central America policy. ``Some in the White House have
been trying to do everything, desperately, in their power to keep
the war going.''
   But a leading backer of Nicaragua's Contra rebels, Senate
Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., said the
president had no choice but to send U.S. troops after the troops of
the Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government reportedly attacked
rebel camps inside Honduras.
   He called the incursion a reaction to defeat of Contra aid
legislation in the House on March 3.
   ``The Sandinista government has given its answer to Congress,''
Boren said. ``This is their way of saying, `Thank you very much.
You have taken the pressure off of us. We think we have this won in
Washington. Now we're going to do what we've always intended and
crush the resistance forces.'''
   Members of Congress on both sides of the divisive Contra aid
issue said the incursion and the U.S. response would have little
effect on prospects for a new aid package.
   Administration officials, including Secretary of State George
Shultz, Assistant Secretary Elliott Abrams, Undersecretary for
Political Affairs Michael Armacost and CIA representatives, went to
Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers on the situation along the border.
   But some members were withholding judgment on the
administration's troop deployment, saying there was too much
conflicting information coming out of the region to know what is
really happening and whether it was warranted.
   ``It is a little hard to tell where the truth is,'' said Rep.
Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   ``The problem with all of this is that our policy in Central
America has been mired in deceptions and partisan confrontation,''
he said. ``I think most members are suspicious ... This has the
smell of a ploy to provide military aid to the Contras.''
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., the senior Republican on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, said after a briefing that the
situation is ``extremely serious. The longer the Sandinstas stay
(in Honduras), the more it jeopardizes the peace process.''
   He said lawmakers were being told that more than 1,000 Contra
troops were hemmed in by Sandinista forces in the Bocay region
along the border, and were in jeopardy.
   ``The administration's actions have been very measured. It's
just a psychological effect at this point,'' Broomfield said.
   Added Rep. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio: ``Unless Congress changes its
position quickly, it's over. It's the beginning of the end. This
was inevitable, and it's a real tragedy.''
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., also
called the incursion serious and said he supported the troop
deployment. ``I believe it might do some good. The name of the game
is to get the Sandinistas to back off.''
   House Democratic leaders questioned the administration's
handling of the entire affair, saying they had continually been
briefed or notified of developments only after the White House had
released information to the news media, and as late as a few hours
before the decision to send troops to Honduras were told no such
action was contemplated.
   ``We were told that the administration was reviewing its
options, but the sending of troops was not among them,'' said House
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.
   ``What we have seen over the past week is not an attempt to
communicate with Congress or build consensus,'' he said. ``It is a
public relations campaign aimed at the media to resurrect the
failed policy of military aid for the Contras.''
   Similar comments came from Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``I am startled by the administration's decision to dispatch
Army units to Honduras, particularly as there was no prior
consultation with the Congress on such a momentous act of
escalation of the conflict in Central America,'' Pell said in a
statement.
   ``... To call hot pursuit an incursion or invasion is an
exaggeration,'' he said. ``This creates a crisis atmosphere which
some may have thought would squeeze more money out of Congress for
the Contras.''

   Planeloads of U.S. soldiers
and supplies began arriving here Thursday in a show of strength
ordered by President Reagan to counter what he called an invasion
by Nicaraguan forces.
   Two battalions from the 82nd Airborne Division of Fort Bragg,
N.C., and two battalions from the 7th Light Infantry Division of
Fort Ord, Calif., were combined into a task force of 3,000 troops.
The group planned joint exercises with Honduran forces.
   The deployment was about 125 miles west of the area where Reagan
administration officials say the Nicaraguan Sandinista army has
chased rebel Contra forces over the border into Honduras.
   Maj. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commander of the 82nd Airborne, said
he knew of no plan to have U.S. troops enter into the
Sandinista-Contra battle.
   ``We have not been told to do so,'' he said before leaving Fort
Bragg. He said the force was capable of that, if needed.
   He also said there was no plan to use the troops if more trouble
broke out in nearby Panama.
   Stiner said the Sandinista movements did not appear to be a
full-fledged invasion, but he saw the U.S. operation as a deterrent.
   Lt. Gen. John W. Foss, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps,
said it was ``playing with words'' to argue what constitutes an
invasion. It was, he said, useful to send a signal.
   ``At what point does intimidation become a threat?'' he asked,
referring to the Sandinista actions.
   The bulk of the troops were flown in Thursday by C-141 transport
plane without any parachute operations because of high winds,
Stiner said. The final 800 troops would arrive Friday by parachute,
weather permitting.
   Stiner said the 82nd Airborne was put on alert for an exercise
in Honduras at 12:55 p.m. Wednesday. The exercise was made public
by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater at 10 p.m., but it wasn't
until four hours later that the division received the final
go-ahead.
   The duration of the exercise has not been determined.
   While in Honduras, the soldiers will train with the local army
on mountaineering, parachute and helicopter operations,
communications and other skills. Foss said the Hondurans recently
taught U.S. servicemen to use mules to help with mountain
expeditions.
   In addition to the C-141 aircraft, a giant C-5A transport was
loaded with helicopter gunships for the exercise.
   A group of reporters from Washington was on the first C-141 to
arrive. The reporters were part of a Department of Defense media
pool that was set up following a ban on coverage of the 1983 U.S.
mission in Grenada.
   About 1,150 of the troops in the Honduras operation were coming
from Fort Ord and the rest from Fort Bragg, Stiner said.
   The news media included Douglas Allmond of ABC-TV, Rick
Inderfurth of ABC-TV, Philip Mishoe of ABC-TV, Otto Kreisher of
Copley News Service, Jay Sapir of UPI Radio, Joseph Marquette of
UPI Photos, Frederick Kempe of the Wall Street Journal, Robert Cohn
of Newsweek, Colleen Combes of Reuters Photos, and Steven Komarow

   U.S. troops began arriving in
Honduras today in a dramatic show of force against Nicaragua.
President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua vowed to liquidate the force.
   The United States sent the 3,200 troops from the 82nd Airborne
Division and the 7th Light Infantry Division after accusing
Nicaragua of invading Honduras in pursuit of Contra rebels.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, spokesman for the Honduran armed
forces, said the government and the army had given Nicaragua ``a
peremptory deadline'' of 24 hours to withdraw 2,000 troops from
Honduras.
   In Managua, capital of Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega
declared, ``We are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces
of the 82nd Airborne Division.''
   But he refused to confirm or deny if Sandinista troops had
crossed the border.
   ``Here the question is not if (Nicaraguan) army troops
penetrated Honduran territory or not, but that we have dozens of
camps of mercenary forces in Honduran territory, in view of and
tolerated by the Honduran government,'' Ortega said at a news
conference.
   He called the U.S. deployment ``another escalation of the war
against Nicaragua'' and asked for a meeting of the U.N. Security
Council.
   The first planeload of U.S. soldiers arrived at Palmerola air
base, the main center of U.S. military operations in Honduras, at
10:15 a.m., a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
   Palmerola is about 40 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa, the
capital, and about 125 miles west of where heavy fighting was
reported Wednesday.
   Honduran military intelligence sources said about 4,000 Honduran
soldiers were still surrounding about 2,000 Nicaraguan troops. The
armed forces spokesman said the troops were six miles inside
Honduras.
   ``We will not allow the Sandinistas to move further into the
interior of our territory,'' said one Honduras military source who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We want to avoid a large conflict, but if it isn't possible,
we will have to face the invading troops.''
   The sources told The Associated Press that the Sandinista
soldiers had been in the border province of Olancho, east of
Tegucigalpa, for 24 hours when Honduran troops encircled them
Wednesday.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the entire
Honduran military was on alert.
   The U.S. Embassy spokesman said 26 C-141 planes carrying the
3,200 troops were arriving at Palmerola every 30 minutes in an
operation code-named ``Golden Pheasant'' by the Pentagon. Other
cargo planes were carrying equipment.
   In Washington, president spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
complete deployment would take about 27 hours. The two battalions
will conduct field exercises with Honduran units.
   The Defense Department said the soldiers were carting their
normal weapons along with nine helicopters and two light tanks.
   It was the the most dramatic show of U.S. force in the six-year
Nicaraguan war and came in response to a request for help from
Honduras' president, Jose Azcona Hoyo.
   Since 1981, Honduras has been a key ally for the United States
in Central America and for Reagan administration policy aimed at
containing Nicaragua's government.
   Until early 1987, Honduras was the major staging ground for
attacks into Nicaragua by the U.S.-backed Contras. The rebels now
say most of their forces are inside Nicaragua.
   The United States maintains about 1,100 soldiers at any one time
distributed among several military installations in Honduras. In
addition, other national guard and army troops rotate through for
joint exercises and road-building and other projects.
   Ortega did confirm that heavy fighting was under way near the
border.
   Nicaragua's Defense Ministry denied Sandinista troops entered
Honduras, and Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of the Foreign
Ministry, repeated that denial on NBC-TV's ``Today.''
   Bendana said Sandinista troops were on a ``routine military
operation'' to push Contras back into Honduras and said it had been
successfully completed. Bendana said Sandinista troops had begun
withdrawing from the border region, and he invited the United
Nations and Organization of American States to visit the area to
see for themselves.
   The intelligence sources in Honduras said the Sandinista troops
apparently entered Honduras late Tuesday to destroy a base camp of
the U.S.-supplied Contras, for whom President Reagan has been
trying to secure continued military funding.
   It was not the Soviet-supplied Sandinistas' first reported
incursion into Honduras. In March 1986, 1,500 Nicaraguan troops
reportedly penetrated Honduran territory and U.S. helicopters
ferried Honduran troops to the border and provided Honduras $20
million in emergency aid.
   The Contras have in the past maintained support bases in
Honduras, but most moved their camps into Nicaraguan territory last
year.
   In December 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery pounded
Sandinista troops who had entered Honduras to attack Contra bases,
and U.S. Army helicopters again were brought in to ferry Honduran
infantrymen to the front.

   Intelligence reports that Nicaragua had sent
forces into Honduras set in motion a flurry of activity over a
30-hour period that culminated in President Reagan's decision to
send ground forces to Honduras.
   For the previous two weeks, the administration had noted with
alarm Sandinista preparations for an offensive in the heavily
jungled Bocay Valley in northern Nicaragua. They had begun within
days after the Feb. 29 cutoff of U.S. aid to the Contras.
   The administration kept quiet about the Sandinista activities
until Tuesday, when State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
the preparations foreshadowed ``the largest offensive we have seen
the Sandinistas undertake.''
   Later in the day, two Pentagon officials who briefed reporters
at the State Department seemed to undercut Redman somewhat by being
less categorical than the spokesman about Sandinista intentions.
   But those discrepencies were quickly forgetten when, soon after
the briefing ended, initial reports that the offensive had started
began to reach Washington. As outlined by Secretary of State George
P. Shultz and other senior administration officials who asked not
to be named, the ensuing period was one of intense activity as the
government decided on an appropriate response.
   The magnitude of the attack surprised officials. Several
thousand Sandinista troops attacked Contra positions on the
Nicaraguan side of the border and upwards of 1,500 troops
penetrated Honduran territory. They also pounded Contra positions
with heavy artillery and aeriel bombardment.
   One apparent aim was the destruction of a Contra military supply
depot which the rebels consider vital to their survival. Another
was to enhance the Sandinista bargaining position for cease-fire
talks with the Contras that are scheduled to begin Monday in a
southern Nicaraguan town.
   On Capitol Hill, there were expressions of skepticism by
Democrats about the early reports. Some felt that the
administration claims were too self-serving to be taken at face
value.
   After all, the administration had been trying for weeks to
fashion a strategy for winning congressional approval for more aid
to the Contras.
   Hours after the initial reports of the offensive had been
received in Washington, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
confirmed them. But he made no reference to a Sandinista border
crossing into Honduras.
   By Wednesday morning, about 18 hours after the first reports of
the Sandinista penetration, the U.S. ambassador to Honduras,
Everett Briggs, met with President Jose Azcona and discussed the
possibility of U.S. assistance to Honduras.
   Azcona consulted by telephone with the presidents of Guatemala,
El Salvador and Costa Rica to tell them of his concerns. He also
called Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to demand the withdrawal
of the Sandinista forces.
   By early afternoon, a Nicaraguan military spokeswoman denied
than an ``invasion'' of Honduras had taken place. At mid-afternoon,
Ortega went on national radio to say that there had been ``cross
fire from Honduran territory against our forces.''
   He neither confirmed nor denied the presence of Nicaraguan
soldiers in Honduras. But House speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex., said
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto had confirmed by
telephone the border crossing but that the Sandinista forces were
retreating back into Nicaragua.
   In late afternoon, Honduran Air Force pilots flew over the area
and reported the Sandinista troop concentrations back to Azcona. At
5 p.m., Azcona met again with Briggs and handed him a letter asking
for U.S. ground troops.
   Briggs later relayed the request to Assistant Secretary of State
Elliott Abrams, who passed it on to National Security adviser Colin
Powell.
   Powell and White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker briefed
Reagan at his residence at 8 p.m., and the president then decided
to comply with the request.
   The White House made the formal announcement at 10 p.m.
Wednesday, emphasizing that the 3,200 troops to be sent to Honduras
would be deployed far from the scene of hostilities and would not
engage in combat.
   Nine hours later, about 2,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne
Division departed Fort Bragg, N.C., on the three-hour flight to
Palmerola Air base in Honduras, about 125 miles from the border
area.
   By 11 a.m., two battalions from the 7th Infantry Division at
Fort Ord, Calif., began heading for the same destination.
   The deployment was aimed, Shultz said, at telling the Hondurans:
``We are your friends. We stand with you.''

   Cobb County officials have banned the buff
_ at least for models in drawing and sculpting classes.
   Officials said they feared negative community reaction to nude
models in the art classes so they ordered them to wear bathing
suits, leotards or ``just basically anything.''
   ``My students don't understand,'' said Stephen Smith, who
teaches life drawing and life sculpting at the county's Steeple
House Arts Center.
   Models in his advanced, adults-only art classes are wearing
bathing suits because of a rule by the county's Community Services
Department a few weeks ago. If the practice continues, Smith said
Wednesday, he'll leave Steeple House, the county's only fully
funded arts center.
   Bob Ash, who heads the Community Services Department, requested
the cover-up because of how ``that kind of activity'' might be
perceived. Ash said he stopped the use of nude models when he
became aware of them.
   ``The community might react in a negative way,'' by no longer
using the arts center, he said.
   Kathy Hoppe, director of the Cobb Arts and Cultural Affairs
Department, has asked the county's Arts Commission to consider
whether nudes should be permitted as subjects in art classes and
displays sponsored and shown by the county.
   Ash has said he will abide by the arts commission's decision.

<HEAD>March 24 Arraignment Set for North, Poindexter, Two Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and two arms dealers were
ordered Thursday to appear March 24 for arraignment on criminal
charges arising from their roles in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The arraignment was scheduled by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell, who will try the case brought by independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh against Poindexter, North and retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his former business partner, Albert
Hakim.
   A lone picketer circled the U.S. Courthouse carrying signs that
read ``Free Oliver North'' and ``Hog Walsh'' to protest the return
Wednesday of a massive indictment against the former National
Security Council aide and his three co-defendants.
   The picketer's views reflected the sentiments of two
congressional Republicans who last year investigated the sale of
U.S. weapons to Iran and the diversion of proceeds to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   ``I personally think that the indictment counts are pathetic,''
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, one of the Reagan administration's
staunchest defenders during last year's congressional hearings,
said during an appearance on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``I don't think that men like Poindexter ... and North deserve
to end up being prosecuted on criminal grounds that deal with their
service in government,'' Rep. Richard Cheney, R-Wyo., said on the
NBC-TV ``Today'' program.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who chaired the House Iran-Contra
committee, defended the indictment, saying it reflected many of the
committee's findings even though the panel did not say criminal
acts were involved.
   ``When we set out, there were a number of laws that we thought
had been broken. ... The indictments track these findings in our
report very carefully,'' Hamilton said.
   In New Orleans, meanwhile, David Jacobsen, one of three American
hostages released as a result of the weapons shipments to Iran,
opened an address to a convention of hospital administrators by
saying he was ``angry that my friend Terry Anderson is entering his
fourth year as a hostage.''
   ``I am also angry that Oliver North, who I also consider a
friend, is being held hostage by a foreign policy dispute between
the president and Congress.''
   Anderson, who is the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is one of nine American hostages being held in
the Middle East. Anderson was kidnapped on a West Beirut street on
March 16, 1985, and is believed being held by pro-Iranian groups in
Lebanon.
   Secord called the charges a ``creation of fantasy ...
ludicrous.'' Speaking in a telephone interview, he said he would
``crush'' the case with legal maneuvering ``in hopes that nobody
else has to go through what I have.''
   The massive 101-page indictment returned Wednesday by a special
grand jury that has investigated the case for 14 months charges
North, Hakim and Secord engaged in a conspiracy to circumvent a
statutory ban on U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels by setting up a
private weapons supply network for the Contras.
   The alleged conspiracy, which the indictment says was later
joined by Poindexter, also corrupted the arms-for-hostage deals
with Iran by diverting more than half the $30 million generated by
the weapons sales to foreign bank accounts controlled by Hakim and
Secord, the indictment said.
   This money was used for other activities of the alleged
``Enterprise'' _ including diversion to the Contras _ as well as
the personal gain of Hakim, Secord and North, the indictment
charged.
   Hakim and Secord were further accused of conspiring to give
North illegal gratuities in the form of $13,800 security system at
his Great Falls, Va., home and setting up a $200,000 education fund
for North's children.
   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral and North, now assigned
to Marine headquarters, are charged with obstructing congressional
inquiries by falsely denying that North coordinated the private
arms network.
   Both also are charged with obstructing the November 1986
congressional inquiry into the arms sales to Iran as the
Iran-Contra affair was unraveling by making false statements to the
House and Senate intelligence committees.
   North is also charged obstructing the Nov. 21-23 presidential
inquiry by Attorney General Edwin Meese III by destroying and
falsifying classified documents and making false statements to
Meese's investigators.
   The indictment also alleges that Poindexter deleted a file of
all messages he sent and received in the National Security
Council's computer system after a memo discussing a ``diversion''
was uncovered by Meese's investigation.
   A federal prosecutor said charges of destruction of evidence, if
proven, could make it easier for Walsh to get convictions.
   Without this element, Walsh might have difficulty persuading a
jury that the defendants were guilty of an essentially political
crime of thwarting the will of Congress by raising private money
for the Contras, said the prosecutor, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

   Doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital said Thursday
they were encouraged by the rapid recovery of Patrick Binder, one
of the Siamese twins separated during a long operation in September.
   Patrick, now 13 months old, stopped breathing Sunday after
choking while feeding through a nasal tube, according to hospital
officials.
   The West German boy was listed in good condition, after spending
several days in the intensive care unit, and was returned to the
room he shares with his brother, Benjamin.
   According to hospital spokeswoman Lisa Hillman, doctors were
hopeful Patrick will return to his previous level of functioning,
which was that of an infant 3 or 4 months old.
   No decision has been made on when the twins might go home, she
said.
   The twins, joined at the back of head at birth, were separated
in a 23-hour operation.

   Smiling and waving, hundreds of young
paratroopers boarded transport planes Thursday and flew to Honduras
for training exercises prompted by reports of an incursion by
Nicaraguan forces.
   ``We're 100 percent ready,'' said Lt. Jim Cooper, smearing
camouflage paint on the face of Lt. Steve Swinley as they prepared
to leave from neighboring Pope Air Force Base.
   ``Give 'em hell,'' added Sgt. Dwight Royal of Fayetteville.
   President Reagan on Wednesday night ordered the deployment of an
infantry brigade task force of 3,200 men consisting of two
battalions of the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg and two from the 7th
Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif.
   Reagan called the move ``a measured response'' to the Nicaraguan
troops movement and to a request for assistance from the Honduran
president.
   The 2,000 combat-ready soldiers from Fort Bragg and 1,200 from
Fort Ord were flying to Palmerola, the main center of U.S. military
operations in Honduras and about 125 miles west of an area where
heavy fighting was reported Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the Rhode Island National Guard said that 100
military police and engineers who had previously been scheduled to
fly to Honduras on Friday will go ahead with plans for
road-building exercises despie increased military activity in the
country. Adjutant Gen. John W. Kiely said the guardsmen will be
deployed far from any potential conflicts between Nicaraguan troops
and the 3,200 U.S. infantry and airborne soldiers.
   Troops began leaving Pope shortly after 7 a.m. on the first of
26 C-141 planes that were taking off every 30 minutes, said Lt.
Gen. John W. Foss, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps. Many of
the soldiers kissed their wives and girlfriends goodbye at
marshaling points on the sprawling base.
   No such farewells were possible for some of the troops at Fort
Ord who were engaged in an exercise when word came that two
battalions would go to Honduras. Many of the men taking part in the
training exercise were unable to get in touch with relatives before
departing.
   ``We've all got swollen eyes, and we're sticking together,''
said Karen Brylewski, a civilian base worker who runs a support
group for families of servicemen at Fort Ord.
   She said she talked to her husband by telephone before he left
and ``he said some of the guys are crying, but everybody has to be
strong. We're just hoping and praying nothing serious comes of
this.''
   From Fort Ord, the troops and supplies were carried on dozens of
trucks to Travis Air Force Base, where the first C-141 lifted off
at 11:29 a.m. EST. ``I expect it to go on all day,'' said Air Force
Maj. Wayne Crist.
   The first planeload of troops from Fort Bragg arrived at
Palmerola at 11:15 a.m. EST in the operation code-named ``Golden
Pheasant'' by the Pentagon, according to local radio stations
transmitting from there.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
complete deployment would take about 27 hours.
   About 800 of the paratroopers were to parachute into a landing
area about five miles from Palmerola on Thursday night or Friday
morning, Foss said.
   ``This is not a hostile environment,'' he said. ``The area has
been cleared for drops.''
   The U.S. troops will conduct training exercises with Honduran
soldiers, including patrols, small unit training, mock air assaults
and airborne operations, said Maj. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commander
of the 82nd Airborne Division.
   Stiner said the troops were also bringing three light
observation helicopters, four Cobra gunship helicopters, one
Blackhawk UH-60 helicopter, a command vehicle and ammunition.
   He said another combat-ready battalion from Fort Bragg had been
placed on alert.
   As the young soldiers _ the average age is 23 _ began boarding
the C-141s early Thursday, many smiled and waved at television
cameras and others raised their weapons in the air.
   ``If you're going to do it, do it,'' said Sgt. John Jones, who
is married with two young children.
   His buddy, Mark Kelley, was more philosophical.
   ``Let's get the job done and get back home,'' he said. ``Another
day, another dollar.''
   Thursday's operation was the latest opportunity for the 82nd
Airborne Division to be called to one of the world's trouble spots.
   ``We are the finger in the dike,'' said Fort Bragg spokesman Lt.
Col. Rick Kiernan. ``In the event of a crisis, we will fight the
first 15 days. If there's sustained action, other conventional
forces would be brought in.''
   The division's most recent combat mission was in Grenada in
October 1983, when two brigades were sent to rescue American
medical students.
   Paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne also saw extensive combat
duty in Vietnam, and some 15,000 paratroopers from Fort Bragg were
sent to the Dominican Republic during a period of political
instability in the early 1960s, Kiernan said.

   The federal government on Thursday moved to
calm depositors' fears and protect the nation's banking system by
advancing $1 billion to banks owned by an ailing Texas holding
company.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it was lending the
money for six months to subsidiaries of First RepublicBank Corp. as
an interim step toward restoring the Dallas-based company's health.
   Ultimately the aid could rival the largest-ever government
rescue of a bank, the $4.5 billion bailout in 1984 of Continental
Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago.
   And in a move intended to stem any ripple effect on the banking
system as a whole, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman pledged his
agency to fully protect all depositors of the banks as well as
general creditors.
   That goes beyond the minimum the agency would normally be
expected to insure, which is deposits of $100,000 and less.
   The promise covers money borrowed overnight from other banks by
First RepublicBank to meet the cash rules of the Federal Reserve
Board. However, it does not apply to the holding company and its
bond and note holders.
   Seidman said the FDIC was working on a long-term solution to the
holding company's problems and was talking to private investors
about participating in a restructuring.
   But he declined to offer specifics and said he could not
estimate the size of any eventual rescue package. Private analysts,
however, say a rescue of First RepublicBank could ultimately cost
the government as much as $2 billion to $4 billion.
   The FDIC expects to recoup much of its initial outlay in the
Continental bailout, ultimately spending about $1.7 billion.
   Seidman, however, stressed the differences between Continental
and First RepublicBank. The Chicago bank's problems were attributed
to management misjudgment and wrongdoing.
   ``It's very clear the primary reason for (the First Republic)
problem is the economy of Texas,'' Seidman told a news conference.
   He said the FDIC will assume some control of the subsidiary
bank's operations, although not day to day. The current bank's
management will remain in place for now, but changes could be
discussed later, he said. The Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency hopes to finish an examination of the company's books
within the next several weeks.
   First RepublicBank, the largest bank company in Texas and the
13th largest in the nation, acknowledged Tuesday it had been forced
to seek federal aid because of a deteriorating loan portfolio,
particularly loans tied to commercial real estate, and difficulty
in stemming a runoff of deposits.
   The holding company, with $33.2 billion in assets and 73
subsidiary banks, reported a loss of $656 million last year.
   The company has no connection with the San Francisco-based First
Republic Bancorp Inc.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Fernand G. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the
House Banking Committee, said he planned to hold hearings on the
First RepublicBank package and on $970 million offered last
September to First City Bancorp. of Houston. That transaction is
still pending because First City bondholders have been balking at
plans to pay them 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar.
   St Germain said in a statement that the committee would seek
``to determine whether better regulation and greater vigilance
could have kept any of these institutions off the assistance
rolls.''
   Twenty-nine of RepublicBank's 73 subsidiaries, representing
about 80 percent of the holding company's assets, are pledging
their stock as collateral for the FDIC loan, and the parent company
is guaranteeing it.
   Federal Reserve Board member Manuel Johnson, who joined Seidman
at the news conference, said First Republic has been borrowing at
the Federal Reserve's discount window for the past several days. He
refused to say how much the bank had borrowed, but did say the bank
had pledged its loans and other assets to back up the borrowings.
   The FDIC reported a post-Depression record of 184 bank failures
last year, 50 in Texas, which has been hard hit by the depressed
energy market and the consequent bust in real estate prices.
   So far this year, 38 commercial banks have failed nationally, 15
of them in Texas.
   Seidman said the First RepublicBank aid would not have a
significant impact on the FDIC's insurance fund, which finished
1987 with $18.3 billion, up slightly from the end of 1986 despite
the failures.
   Analysts, however, say that cutting FDIC losses by attracting
private investors to First RepublicaBank will be difficult.
   ``I think it's going to be tough. This is a monster of a
turnaround,'' said Paul Getman, senior financial analyst of The
Wefa Group, a Philadelphia-area consulting firm.

   FBI Director William H. Webster may have been
``misinformed'' in 1985 when he defended continuing a terrorism
investigation into a group opposing Reagan administration policy in
Central America, a congressman said Thursday.
   The FBI's investigation of the Committee in Support of the
People of El Salvador was closed just two months later for lack of
evidence.
   At a congressional hearing Thursday, Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner
referred to Webster's testimony of April 17, 1985, in which the
then-FBI director, now head of the CIA, justified continuing the
CISPES investigation.
   But the inquiry ended in June 1985 following a review by the
Justice Department which concluded that CISPES was involved in
political activities involving First Amendment rights and not
international terrorism.
   Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said the shutdown such a short time after
Webster supported the investigation raised the question of
``whether there was this review going on when Webster made the
statement.''
   The congressman said he was certain that a decision ``was not
made quickly or rashly'' to close the terrorism investigation,
which had been going on since 1983, preceded by an earlier domestic
criminal investigation begun in 1981.
   ``I don't know if Webster was misinformed or what,''
Sensenbrenner said after raising the issue with current FBI
Director William Sessions at a hearing before the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights.
   Sessions confirmed his own statements of last month about the
investigation being closed in June 1985, but said any elaboration
would have to wait until an internal FBI review of the bureau's
handling of the CISPES inquiry is completed.
   In his April 1985 testimony before the same subcommittee,
Webster said ``we are not keeping track of the membership of CISPES
as such. There are, as in many organizations, a wide range of
individuals engaged in that organization, including some in whom we
have a legitimate independent foreign counterintelligence
interest.''
   Webster's comments came in response to complaints from Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., that a member of CISPES who had traveled to
Nicaragua had been interviewed by the FBI for ``intelligence
gathering'' purposes.
   Telephone calls to the office of CIA spokesman William Baker,
who also served with Webster at the FBI, were not returned
immediately.
   In January, the Center for Constitutional Rights released FBI
documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act showing
that the FBI had investigated CISPES extensively.
   The investigation included photographing protesters at peace
rallies and recording their license-plate numbers, investigating
nuns, union members and college students and checking up on church
forums, according to the documents.
   Last month, Sessions denied that the bureau had mounted a
massive surveillance campaign, but did acknowledge that the
investigation ``was not properly directed'' in all instances.

   A forthcoming hour-long NBC television movie
about hunger overlooks the contribution that government school
lunch programs offer to needy families, the Agriculture Department
said Thursday.
   The network movie, ``A Place at the Table,'' is scheduled for
broadcast the night of March 20 and focuses on children in school
who may be hungry, officials said.
   Dianne Durant, a spokeswoman for the department's Food and
Nutrition Service, said the agency's complaint had been sent to NBC
but that there had been no response.
   Curt Block, NBC vice president for media relations, said in a
telephone interview from New York that the purpose of the film's
producers ``was to take a broader focus of the problem of hunger''
among children and to ``get across to the public how pervasive the
problem is.''
   Block said the intent also was to show that ``there are a number
of ways we can get food to children.''
   Assistant Secretary John W. Bode, who oversees school lunch and
food stamp programs, said in a statement that ``despite the
laudable public service aspects of the movie, it contains serious
inaccuracies'' about hunger.
   ``In the movie, children are encouraged to donate their brown
bag lunches to classmates who are so hungry they attend a soup
kitchen after school,'' Bode said. ``The film does not acknowledge
the existence of the National School Lunch Program, which provides
free school lunches to children of low-income families.''
   Further, he said, preschool breakfasts are also provided in
schools which participate in the USDA program.
   ``School lunch is only one of a number of federal food
assistance programs, including food stamps, which provide more than
$20 billion worth of help a year to needy Americans,'' Bode said.
``That figure translates into $56 million a day in food help.''
   Further, he said:
   _The school lunch program is one of the largest food service
providers in the country, serving 24 million children daily, nearly
half of whom receive lunches free of charge.
   _Children from families with low incomes are eligible for the
free school meals. The program's current upper income limit for a
family of four is $14,560 a year.
   _Since 1980, the federal budget for school lunches has increased
21 percent to the current annual level of $3.4 billion.

<HEAD>Shultz Said US Troops Sent to Signal Opposition to Aggression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Thursday the 3,200 U.S. combat troops airlifted during the day to
Central America are not there in a ``shooting capacity'' but to
signal opposition to Nicaraguan aggression.
   Senior Democrats in Congress quickly questioned President
Reagan's decision to send the troops, with Senate Majority Leader
Robert C. Byrd Jr., of West Virginia calling it an ``overreaction.''
   Officials on both sides of the issue predicted the military
situation would reignite the controversy over Contra aid that has
divided Congress for several years. And there was dispute among
lawmakers as to whether Nicaragua had indeed invaded Honduras, the
justification cited for the decision to send U.S. forces.
   Shultz told a Senate committee that the troops airlifted to
Honduras were dispatched to ``get people's attention to what is
happening in Central America'' and to say to the Honduran
government, ``We are your friends. We stand with you.''
   But senior Democrats challenged Reagan's justification for the
action.
   ``It's an overreaction,'' said Byrd. ``We've heard the
administration cry, `Wolf, wolf,' before. I don't know when they're
crying `wolf, wolf.'''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who has supported the peace
plan drafted by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, said sending
U.S. combat troops to the area was unjustified. He voiced concern
that the White House may have overblown the incident for its own
purposes.
   Not all Democrats agreed, and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
of Kansas sprang to Reagan's defense, declaring that Contra rebels
are being overrun and ``slaughtered by the hundreds.''
   He called on the president to immediately resubmit a package of
military and logistical aid for the Contra rebels and said: ``Does
it make sense, even as thousands of communist troops cross the
border of a free country in this hemisphere, for members of
Congress to make excuses for (Nicaragua's) aggression, while
accusing the president of the United States of fueling the fires of
war in Central America?''
   Officials of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government said
their troops were not in Honduras, but the administration said it
dispatched U.S. forces at the request of Honduran President Jose
Azcona. Officials said they received the request because Sandinista
forces were in Honduras threatening to overrun Contra bases.
   The Contras have been battling the Managua government for
several years with the support of the Reagan administration, but
U.S. aid to them expired at the end of February and the House
refused to renew it.
   Shultz took note of that as he appeared before the Senate Budget
Committee. ``Obviously the decision in the House of Representatives
to deny aid to the resistance has dealt them _ and in my opinion
tha cause of freedom _ a very serious blow,'' he said.
   Shultz said the U.S. troops from the Army's 82nd Airborne and
7th Light Infantry divisions aren't in Honduras in a ``shooting
capacity.''
   ``It is important for people to know the United States will
fight, but we don't plan to get involved in any military way,'' he
said.
   Shultz said that as of Wednesday there were 1,600 to 2,000
Nicaraguan soldiers across the Honduran border. He said there had
been heavy fighting, that two airfields had been seized and that
the Sandinistas had spearheaded their attacks on Contra forces with
airplane and helicopter strikes.
   Shultz, noting that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega had
issued a denial of troop presence in Honduras on Wednesday, said
Wright had told him he had been called by the Nicaraguan foreign
minister and told that the Sandinista troops would be withdrawn.
   Underscoring the apparent contradiction, Shultz said: ``I don't
know which one is lying; maybe both.''
   Not all Democrats objected to Reagan's decision to dispatch
troops.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said after a classified briefing that
``there has clearly been a penetration'' by Sandinista troops ``in
fair numbers'' into Honduras.
   Shultz laid out this scenario:
   _Intelligence efforts detected preparations for a Nicaraguan
offensive drive beginning on March 1.
   _First contact between the Sandinistas and Contras inside
Honduras came on March 10.
   _On Tuesday, the Contras reported heavy fighting and attacks
from Nicaraguan bombers inside Honduras.
   _On Wednesday, ``we saw a presence of 1,600 to 2,000 Sandinista
troops'' in Honduras aided by bombers and helicopters.
   The Democratic chairman and Republican vice chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee said after an administration briefing
that Reagan had no choice but to dispatch the troops.
   After listening to representatives of the intelligence agencies
and Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, Sen. David Boren,
D-Okla., and William Cohen, R-Maine, agreed that a planned
incursion had taken place, not a hot pursuit of Contra forces.
   Boren, saying the Contras are ``outnumbered three or four to
one,'' told reporters the Sandinistas are ``reading the tea leaves
in Congress'' and ``taking a riverboat gamble that they can deliver
a crushing blow. This was a reaction of the Sandinista government
to the defeat of Contra aid.
   ``The Sandinista government has given its answer to Congress.
This is their way of saying, ``Thank you very much. You have taken
the pressure off of us. We think we have this won in Washington.
Now we're going to do what we always intended to do and crush the
resistance forces.''
   Cohen said, ``The administration is responding to a request for
political support (from Honduras) at this point.''
   But Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said, ``I think the notion that
there's a real invasion is just ridiculous.
   Some members of Congress noted that the deployment came as the
administration was making a renewed push for aid for the Contras.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said he doubted whether the outcome
will be changed.
   `We're very evenly divided in the House and in the Congress on
aid, and I don't see that fundamentally changing,'' he said.

   America's Irish paraded on St. Patrick's Day, but enthusiasm was
muted by the awareness of fresh bloodshed in Northern Ireland.
   ``The violence, it's got to stop,'' declared William Burke,
grand marshal of the parade up New York's Fifth Avenue. ``You shoot
me. I shoot you. ... This can't go on any more.''
   Across from St. Patrick's Cathedral, sign-waving protesters
demanded ``Great Britain Keep Out of Irish Affairs,'' a day after
three people were killed and 68 wounded by a Protestant gunman who
attacked a graveside service for three Irish Republican Army
members in Belfast.
   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston said the root of the violence
was ``the utter despair that British rule has perpetrated
throughout the occupied six counties.''
   ``What can we expect but senseless and renewed violence from
both communities, when the British government itself has abandoned
a code of law enforcement for a shoot-to-kill policy aimed at
unarmed citizens,'' said Flynn.
   In an emotional homily before his city's parade, New York's
Cardinal John J. O'Connor proposed a pilgrimage to Ireland to pray
for ``peace with justice.''
   ``I would like to feel exuberant. I would like to feel joyful,''
O'Connor told a congregation of about 2,000. ``I don't feel that
way today. I don't feel like reviewing a parade. I suspect many of
you don't feel like marching in a parade.''
   The parade went on, however, with O'Connor adding heavy black
gloves to his vestments to protect against a blustery wind.
Organizers estimated that 1.25 million people crowded Fifth Avenue
to watch the parade, but police reported little of the drunken
rowdiness which has marked past holidays.
   Christine Bittinger, 78, was walking up Fifth Avenue for two
reasons: ``I'm walking for justice in Northern Ireland. And because
old age has played a dirty trick on me. I've gotten smaller, and I
can't see from behind the crowd anymore.''
   The nation's highest elected son of Ireland, President Reagan,
paid a visit to an Irish pub in Alexandria, Va., sipping beer and
singing along as revelers joined in ``When Irish Eyes are Smiling.''
   In New Haven, Conn., protests by the National Organization for
Women, the NAACP and other groups were planned outside the all-male
Knights of St. Patric dinner, traditionally a must gathering for
politicians.
   More than 200,000 people crowded the sidewalk in downtown
Chicago to watch the 40,000 marchers, 50 floats and 45 bands that
made up the annual parade. Portions of the Chicago River were dyed
green for the annual day of revelry. ``They make much more of it
here than in Ireland,'' said Bridgid Donnelly, 19, an Irish citizen
living in Chicago.
   There were few mentions of Belfast in Chicago, where parade
organizers strived for a holiday mood.
   Even the grits were green as 300,000 people braved unseasonable
30-degree temperatures to see the 164th St. Patrick's Day parade in
Savannah, Ga. It's the second-largest St. Pat's parade, behind New
York's.
   In New Orleans, hundreds of people spent the day drinking,
dancing and celebrating in the streets around Parasol's Bar and
Restaurant in New Orleans' Irish Channel. Even some of the
neighborhood dogs sported green T-shirts and strings of green beads
as they circled the crowd.
   ``I marched in my first St. Patrick's Day parade in 1922,'' said
Red Jack Burns, who wore a green derby, ``and I haven't missed one
since. I'm 77 years old but I can still find the bars in the
Channel.''
   In New York City, the Friendy Sons of St. Patrick were dining
for the first time with oratory by an Irish-American. Antonin
Scalia, a Supreme Court Justice, and Lou Holtz, coach of Notre
Dame's ``Fighting Irish'' football team, were the featured speakers.
   In his sermon, O'Connor accused Irish-Americans, and priests and
nuns in particular, of not expressing sufficient concern with the
troubles in Northern Ireland.
   ``Where are the 40 million Irish-Americans in this land?'' he
asked. ``Why have they not raised their voices on behalf of the
suffering?''
   ``And where are the voices of our priests and nuns?'' he added,
especially those ``social activists'' concerned about Latin America
and other parts of the world.
   O'Connor suggested a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Our Lady of
Knock in the Irish Republic ``to show our concern, our continuing
sense of shock. We must do something ... to contribute to the
advance of peace with justice in Northern Ireland.''
   Cardinal Bernard Law asked worshippers at Holy Cross Cathedral
in South Boston ``to call to mind the sad wages of sin in the
violence and the terrorism which is only within hours hit once
again in Ireland.''
   ``Let us look into our hearts and see how it might be that like
Patrick we can be messengers of love of reconciliation of justice
and of peace,'' Law said.

   Drummer Archie Francis on Thursday won his
11th Academy of Country Music Award, and fiddler Johnny Gimble and
steel guitarist J.D. Maness each won their 10th trophies to lead
winners in instrumental categories.
   The winners were announced Thursday by academy Executive
Director Bill Boyd; trophies will be presented during the 23rd
annual Academy of Country Music Awards on Monday in Buena Park.
   Bass player Emory Gordy Jr., guitarist Chet Atkins and
keyboardist John Hobbs won their second consecutive academy
trophies, Boyd said. Winners were picked by ballots cast by the
2,500-member academy.
   David Hungate tied Gordy in the bass category, Ronnie Milsap
tied Hobbs in the keyboard category, and Ricky Skaggs, who plays
mandolin, tied with Jerry Douglas, who plays the dobro, in the
specialty instrument category.
   The Strangers won their eighth touring band trophy and Nashville
Now won the non-touring band award.
   The academy announced earlier that the nation's top country
music radio station was in Arizona, the favorite disc jockey was in
Tennessee and the wildest nightclub was in Southern California.
   Jim Tabor of radio WMC in Memphis, Tenn., was selected disc
jockey of the year, his first academy win, and KNIX radio in
Phoenix, Ariz., was picked the top radio station. KNIX also won the
award last year.
   The Crazyhorse Steakhouse & Saloon in Santa Ana won the
nightclub of the year honor for a second consecutive year.
   The winners are voted by record company promotion executives,
independent promoters, music industry trade publications and
executives of the academy, said Boyd.
   The Academy of Country Music votes by secret ballot on the
organization's major awards. Leading the list of nominees are Hank
Williams Jr., Randy Travis and George Strait.
   Others with multiple nominations include Alabama, newcomers K.T.
Oslin and Ricky Van Shelton, the Bellamy Brothers, Crystal Gayle,
The Judds, Reba McEntire and Restless Heart.
   Winners will be announced during a two-hour NBC-TV special with
Williams and Miss McEntire as hosts.

<TEXT>
   The government has banned a church
magazine that criticized last month's preliminary election as a
``mockery of democracy.''
   Attorney General Matthew Muli on Tuesday banned ``all past and
future issues'' of Beyond magazine, which is sponsored by the
National Christian Council of Kenya.
   Staff members tried Wednesday to deliver a truckload of back
issues to police, but officers refused to accept them, the deputy
editor, Rev. Ibrahim Dmondi, said.
   ``We were told we can keep them until the government makes a
public announcement on what should be done with the old copies,''
Omondi told The Associated Press.
   Under Kenya's penal code, it is illegal to print, make, import,
publish, sell, offer for sale or supply, distribute, reproduce, or
have in one's possession a prohibited publication. Violation of the
law carries a prison term of up to three years.
   The ban came one week after Beyond, in a special edition,
criticized the Feb. 22 primary elections for Parliament as ``a
mockery of democracy.'' During the primary, voters were required to
line up behind candidates or their agents, and Beyond charged that
some voters were intimidated by administration officials into
voting for certain candidates.
   Officials of Kenya Africa National Union, the country's only
political party, have acknowledged there were problems with the
system, but they accused Beyond of exaggerating the problems and of
``sloppy journalism.''
   The general election is set for Monday and voting will be by
secret ballot.
   Beyond editor Bedan Mbugua, who attended Biola College in La
Mirada, Calif., said in an interview that he stood by Beyond's
claims.
   ``When we saw something going wrong in our society, we commented
without fear or favor,'' he said.
   ``I feel we have lived up to the journalism we were committed
to,'' said Mbugua.
   Police Special Branch officers, who are responsible for internal
security, questioned Mbugua for two hours March 10, the day after
Beyond went on sale.
   Beyond has been published since June 1985 and is sponsored by
the National Council of Churches of Kenya, a grouping of Protestant
churches.
   The only other local publication to be banned was the newspaper
Voice of Kenya, which was published by Nairobi North Co. and
sponsored by the Libyan Embassy. The government claimed the
newspaper was being used for political means.

<HEAD>Young Families Facing Bigger Hurdles To Homeownership, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young families trying to purchase their first
home and low-income families struggling to meet escalating rental
payments are two groups which have suffered the most from flawed
housing policies in the 1980s, according to a new study released
Thursday.
   ``America is increasingly becoming a nation of housing haves and
have-nots,'' said H. James Brown, one of the authors of the report
and the director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard
University. ``While a majority of Americans are well-housed, too
many Americans have not been able to share in this prosperity.''
   The report, titled ``The State of the Nation's Housing,''
contended that the number of Americans unable to secure decent and
affordable housing was growing at an alarming rate. Among its
findings:
   _Since 1981, rental costs including utilities, have risen 14
percent faster than prices generally. After adjusting for
inflation, rental costs are now at their highest level in two
decades.
   _The steep increase in rental costs means that single-parent
households must devote 58.4 percent of their incomes to rent,
compared to 34.9 percent in 1974.
   _Homeownership rates have fallen steadily during this decade,
particularly among young people. In 1980, 43.3 percent of
households in the 24-29 age group owned their own home, a figure
that has now declined to 35.9 percent.
   _The after-tax cost of buying a typical first home in 1987 was
$7,449, or 32.4 percent of the average annual income of potential
first-time buyers, about 50 percent higher than the share of income
required in the early 1970s.
   The study, which was financed by a grant from the Ford
Foundation and several housing trade groups, did not make any
recommendations for needed changes in government policy.
   The Reagan administration has been criticized in the past for
its efforts to scale back federal housing assistance programs, but
Brown said it was important to realize that the country's housing
problems were a result of a number of forces which have been at
work well before the current administration took office.
   In reacting to the report, Carl D. Covitz, undersecretary of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, said that the
administration was proud of its efforts in the past seven years to
boost housing subsidies to low-income families but realized ``much
more needs to be done.''
   ``It's never been easy for the typical family to buy their first
home or for very low-income people to afford decent housing and the
Harvard study performs a valuable service by pointing up some of
the very real problems still faced by many American families,''
Covitz said in a statement.
   William Apgar, another author of the report, said that one
particular problem was that even minimal federal housing assistance
was reaching only one in four families in need.
   ``Only one in four rentor households with incomes at or below
the poverty level live in public housing or receive some other form
of federal housing assistance,'' Apgar said.

<HEAD>Thurmond Won't Help Citizens Restore Original Name To Thurmond
Lake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A citizens group upset over congressional
action to rename a lake after Sen. Strom Thurmond presented the
South Carolina Republican with petitions signed by 42,000 people
Thursday urging that the original name be restored.
   But Thurmond refused to become involved in the controversy after
meeting privately for 35 minutes with representatives of the group
and with South Carolina legislators supporting the name change to
honor Thurmond.
   Thurmond declined to answer questions as he left the meeting at
his Capitol office, referring them to his press secretary,
Christopher Simpson.
   ``He told them he feels the matter is settled and since he did
not instigate it or push for it, he feels it would be inappropriate
for him to get involved now,'' Simpson said.
   The dispute over the name of the Army Corps of Engineers-built
Clarks Hill Lake, which straddles the South Carolina-Georgia
border, began in December which Congress, acting quickly and with
no public hearings, enacted legislation changing the name of the
lake, dam and road to Strom Thurmond.
   Roy Giles, a Lincolnton, Ga., restaurant owner and one of the
leaders of the citizens group, said the petitions propose a
compromise that would restore the name of the lake to Clarks Hill
but would retain the new Strom Thurmond name for the dam and road.
   Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., has introduced legislation paterned
after the compromise, which Giles said would permit Thurmond to
``have his monument and the people will have their lake back.''
   South Carolina state Sen. John Drummond of Greenwood said the
legislators told the citizens group that it would be an
embarrassment for Thurmond to ``ask the whole Congress and the
president to reverse what they've done.''
   Drummond said he told the group the two states need to work
together ``to save that lake, not the name'' because the low water
level in the lake is threatening its recreational potential.
   Giles said the name change will result in financial losses for
businesses that have built their reputations using the Clarks Hill
name. And he vowed that the group will continue its fight, even
without Thurmond's help.

<HEAD>Chamber President Wrote Lowery About Report of `Negative' News
Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chamber of Commerce has apologized to the
Rev. Joseph Lowery for including stories profiling civil rights
activists on a list of potentially negative stories journalists
might write during the Democratic National Convention.
   Chamber President Jerry Bartels had received complaints on
Lowery's behalf after reports that chamber officials regarded the
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as a
public relations liability.
   A chamber official said Wednesday the group made a mistake in
putting the subject of profiles of civil rights activists on a list
of potentially negative news stories about Atlanta.
   Barry King, the chamber's vice president for communication, said
lists of ``positive'' and ``negative'' potential media topics were
drafted to help the chamber prepare to respond to reporters'
questions during the convention this July.
   The lists appeared in the chamber's newsletter last month. The
Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution subsequently reported
that chamber officials considered Lowery among the ``negative''
news figures.
   Negative subjects on the chamber's list include Ku Klux Klan
activity, nude dance clubs and textbook banning. On the positive
list were Southern hospitality, the book and movie ``Gone With the
Wind,'' and Atlanta's Fortune 500 companies.
   Following the news reports, Bartels wrote Lowery, saying the
chamber considers him a positive force in Atlanta. No other letters
were sent, King said, because there were no other questions about
the chamber's views on a specific civil rights figure.
   However, Lowery said Tuesday that he didn't consider the letter
an apology. ``What he never did explain was how profiles of civil
rights leaders get in a negative category,'' he said.
   ``We never mentioned the names of anybody on any of these
lists,'' King said. He said he regretted that ``positive'' and
``negative'' labels were used.
   Many of the stories, he said, could turn out to be flattering or
derogatory depending on how they were written. A story about civil
rights might be negative, he said, because the ``overall record of
achievement could be questioned.''
   If reporters ask about civil rights leaders, he said, ``We would
simply put them in touch with the civil rights leaders.''

   Israel began its first major trials on
Thursday of soldiers charged with brutality in the Arab rebellion,
and Palestinians wounded an Israeli with gunfire for the first time
since the violence began Dec. 8.
   Israeli warplanes raided Palestinian guerrilla bases in the
mountains south of Beirut, and newspapers said Secretary of State
George P. Shultz may return to the Middle East early next month to
promote the U.S. peace plan. The raid came a day after rockets
landed in northern Israel, causing light damage.
   Authorities increased restrictions in the occupied territories,
which already include travel bans and a cut-off of telephone
service to the outside. A military official said Palestinians must
get approval to bring $1,000 or more from neighboring Jordan, where
most hold citizenship and have family.
   The rules are intended to hamper the Palestine Liberation
Organization in organizing and financing the protests.
   Trials beginning Thursday involved the burial alive of four
Arabs by an army bulldozer Feb. 5 in Kfar Salem, a West Bank
village, and the beating Feb. 24 of two Palestinians near Nablus,
which was photographed by a CBS News crew.
   Neighbors soon rescued the buried Palestinians. The beating was
televised around the world and aroused international protest.
   Several weeks after trouble began in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the army introduced a policy of beating rioters as an
alternative to firing live ammunition. At least 100 Palestinians
have been killed in more than three months of violence, and
hundreds wounded.
   Yair Nissimi and Dror Segen-Cohen, both army privates, pleaded
guilty in the burial case to reduced charges of shameful behavior.
The plea bargain would give Nissimi 2{ months in jail and
Segen-Cohel two months, and both would be placed on probation.
   A three-judge panel is to rule March 29 on whether to accept the
arrangement.
   Sgt. Maj. Charlie Danino pleaded innocent to assault and
unbecoming conduct, and is expected to argue that he was not at the
scene.
   Mustafa Hamdan, one of those buried, said of the plea bargain:
``They buried four people alive. If an Arab did that they would
have given him 200 years.''
   Defense lawyer Josef Danai said in court the burial was ``an
instance of letting off steam, revenge and deterrence'' by soldiers
in difficult circumstances.
   ``They spilled a little earth on them,'' he said. ``The tractor
driver said an ant could have gotten out of it.''
   Sgt. Amichai Vaturi, who was at the scene but is not charged,
testified that the Arabs were covered with about two feet of wet
earth but their heads and shoulders were exposed.
   Hamdan said the heads of three men were covered.
   In the beating case, Sagi Harpaz and Yehuda Angel, army
privates, pleaded innocent to assault and the case was recessed.
   Two other soldiers were sentenced Tuesday to 10 and 21 days in
jail for minor roles in the beating.
   In the Gaza Strip, a 25-year-old Khan Yunis resident, Subhi Abu
Sharar, was shot in the chest and seriously wounded, said Ilana
Ziv, spokeswoman for Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon.
   Arab reports said Israeli soldiers shot him during a
demonstration.
   Also in Gaza, two Arabs shot 44-year-old Israeli contractor Adi
Tzabari four times in the legs near Jabalia refugee camp, Ms. Ziv
said.
   Tzabari told Israel army radio ``I threw a hammer'' at one Arab
with a pistol, ``then another one appeared with a Kalashnikov
(assault rifle) and opened fire.''
   The army confirmed the shooting. It was the first time an
Israeli, civilian or soldier, has been reported hit by Arab gunfire
since the beginning of what Palestinians now call ``the uprising.''
   An Arab truck driver in the same area tried to run down an
Israeli soldier earlier Thursday but the soldier escaped without
injury, the army said.
   Arab reports from Jabaliya said the army fired tear gas and
rubber bullets at 800 schoolgirls who stoned soldiers, raised
Palestinian flags and burned tires.
   Officials of a U.N. clinic said 25 girls were treated for minor
injuries. Palestine Press Service, an Arab-run news agency, said
soldiers in the West Bank arrested 150 Palestinians overnight in
Nablus, Jenin, Qabitiyeh, Ramallah and Hebron.
   Arab reporters said the army blocked dairy and produce
deliveries to Nablus, Tulkarm and Jericho.
   The army said these reports were being checked.

   Paul Simon, his Democratic presidential
candidacy rejuvenated by his homestate primary win, campaigned
Wednesday on the prospect of a brokered convention and said he was
``as acceptable as a second choice as anyone.''
   Simon toured Wisconsin and Michigan, both with important
contests in the coming weeks, and expressed hope he'll be the
mutual ``second choice'' who might emerge with the presidential
nomination once the front-runners have fallen short of victory.
   ``We're not going to have a first-ballot winner in Atlanta,'' he
said.
   ``I will have a significant block of delegates. ... I think Paul
Simon is as acceptable as a second choice as anyone,'' he said. ``I
think I stand in a very good position.''
   Simon did not predict victory for himself in Michigan's March 26
caucuses or Wisconsin's April 5 primary, but he said he would pick
up enough convention delegates to stay in the race.
   ``I've come to Michigan not expecting to carry Michigan, but I'd
like to pick up as many delegates as I can,'' Simon told a news
conference near the state Capitol.
   In Milwaukee earlier in the day, he said, ``I can't tell you
precisely where I think we'll come in, but I think we have a good
shot of winning here and I am going to make every effort to win.''
   Simon won a lopsided Illinois primary victory Tuesday, followed
by another favorite son, Jesse Jackson, in second, and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis relegated to a lackluster third.
   Dukakis and Jackson top the race for delegates with more than
400 apiece, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. is in second, while Simon and Rep.
Richard Gephardt stand far back in the count.

   A domestic jetliner with up to 136
people aboard crashed during a storm in the northern Colombia
mountains Thursday and burst into flames, with no immediate sign of
survivors, officials said.
   The Boeing 727 had just left Cucuta, about 250 miles northeast
of Bogota, and crashed at nearby Zulia, police at the town said,
quoting witnesses.
   There was no immediate confirmation from the Civil Aeronautics
Agency, which reported the Avianca flight missing soon after
takeoff.
   Zulia police said three witnesses reported that the plane
clipped some trees, then slammed into the earth and burned, and
they saw no survivors.
   According to the government air transport agency, it left Cucuta
near the Venezuelan border at 1:16 p.m. for Barranquilla, a
Caribbean port 250 miles northwest.
   How many people were on the flight was not clear. The agency
said 136, including five crew members, but Avianca said there were
78 passengers and six crew.
   The control tower at Cucuta lost contact with the plane 15
minutes after takeoff as the aircraft traveled through the
mountainous region in stormy weather, the aeronatics agency said,
adding that it did not report mechanical problems.
   Colombia's last major air crash occurred July 27, 1985, when an
air force transport plane went down in the Amazon jungle, killing
74 people. It was transporting passengers because of an airline
strike.

<HEAD>De Mita Is Asked To Form New Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francesco Cossiga on Wednesday asked
Ciriaco De Mita, leader of the dominant Christian Democrats, to try
to form Italy's 48th government since World War II.
   De Mita, 60, indicated he would seek to put together a coalition
of the same five parties that have governed off and on since 1981:
Christian Democrats, Socialists, Republicans, Social Democrats and
Liberals.
   Cossiga named De Mita premier-designate after three days of
consultations with political leaders following Premier Giovanni
Goria's resignation. Goria, a Christian Democrat, stepped down
Friday after 7{ turbulent months in office.
   De Mita told reporters at Quirinal Palace after meeting Cossiga
that he would open negotiations Friday with the other parties.
   He said the Christian Democrats want solidarity ``among the same
five parties of the coalition.''
   The key to De Mita's chances will be support of the Socialists,
the No. 2 party in the coalition. Socialist leader Bettino Craxi
said Wednesday he did not object to De Mita's candidacy but that
his support would depend on the program outlined.
   Among divisive issues facing De Mita is Italy's nuclear policy.
A government decision last week to resume construction of a nuclear
power plant near Rome angered the Socialists and helped force Goria
to resign.
   Also in dispute is the fate of the secret vote in Parliament.
The Socialists want the secret vote abolished.
   The bald-pated De Mita was elected in 1982 as secretary of the
Christian Democrats, a post many consider the most powerful
political position in Italy.
   De Mita, son of a tailor, was born in Nusco, a small hill town
near Naples. He entered politics in the 1950s after earning a law
degree. He was elected to Parliament in 1963 and has held his seat
since then, serving as a minister in several governments in the
1970s.
   Political commentators and cartoonists often poke fun at De
Mita's thick southern accent. He and his wife Anna Maria have four
children.

   The presidential candidates who made it
through the costly Super Tuesday and Illinois contests are now
lining up fund-raising events to see them through the rest of the
primary season.
   Some of the most cash-draining states are yet to come _ New
York, Pennsylvania, California and Ohio.
   Vice President George Bush has no money worries, and GOP rival
Pat Robertson has already shelled out nearly all he can legally
spend. But the Democrats continue hunting for cash for their
generally lighter treasuries, and Republican Sen. Bob Dole is also
seeking contributions.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri both are scrimping along, looking to draw enough
contributions to keep their campaigns afloat beyond caucuses on
March 26 in Michigan and primaries March 29 in Connecticut and
April 5 in Wisconsin.
   The Democratic money leader, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
has ``an active April fund-raising schedule,'' and remains in good
financial shape, a spokesman said.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson, whose fund-raising has trailed that of
opponents, has been picking up money through an aggressive mail
program, and will appeal for money in California this weekend.
   Aides to Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee did not return calls
Thursday to discuss his financial picture.
   Bush's schedule includes a handful of dinners and receptions
through April, and then he can close up his fund-raising shop. That
is because he will have brought in as much as he can spend on his
primary campaign under election law rules, said campaign treasurer
Fred Bush, who is no relation to the candidate.
   The limit is $27 million, and the campaign figures on another $2
million or so for legal and accounting costs, which are exempt from
the limit.
   Money has been pouring into the Bush coffers as he heads to
all-but-certain nomination this summer.
   The vice president's push down the fund-raising home stretch
included a $1,000-a-person dinner Thursday night in Washington, for
which 170 people were signed up and another two dozen had to be
turned away, said the campaign treasurer.
   In addition to the events, Bush will mail one more appeal to his
70,000 or so donors who have not yet ``maxed out'' with the $1,000
maximum contribution they are allowed to give.
   Bush currently has more than $4 million in cash on hand,
spokeswoman Ede Holiday said Thursday. Although he has nearly
raised the limit, he can continue campaigning because he has not
spent it all.
   In a different situation is GOP rival Robertson, the former TV
evangelist, who must drastically scale back his campaign operation
to avoid exceeding the spending limit.
   Robertson has said he will rely heavily on volunteer efforts to
see him through the rest of the campaign.
   Dale Tate, a spokeswoman for Sen. Dole of Kansas said that after
Dole's poor showing on Super Tuesday and in Illinois, receipts had
not ``fallen off precipitously.''
   In fact, she said, people have been calling unsolicited to
pledge money and urge him not to drop out.
   ``These are Republicans saying we think there should be a
race,'' she said.
   On Friday, callers pledged $140,000, on Monday $95,000 and on
Tuesday $60,000, she said. Still, she added, ``we're not bathing in
dollars,'' and no decisions on TV advertising have been made for
the campaign's next targeted state, Wisconsin.
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said the campaign raised $100,000
Wednesday night in New York and is focusing on raising money for
the New York and Pennsylvania primaries. Dukakis' strong showing in
the 20-state Super Tuesday contests on March 8 has kept money
flowing to him, he said.
   Dukakis has about $1.5 million in the bank, not counting the
more than $600,000 he got this week in federal matching funds, said
spokesman Leslie Dach.
   For Simon and Gephardt, both of whom did poorly in the Super
Tuesday races, the situation was not so bright, although both said
they were not in debt.
   Both also said they had record fund-raising months in February _
Gephardt collecting $1.2 million and Simon more than $900,000. A
Simon spokesman conceded, ``March will not be a record for us as
February was.''
   ``It's a day-to-day thing,'' said Gephardt's spokesman Mark
Johnson. ``We're using aggressive fund-raising'' techniques, mostly
involving phone calls to contributors. ``You're at a point now
where cash flow is very important, and you need a quick
turnaround,'' he said.
   Gephardt is is targeting Michigan for a heavy advertising
campaign, but Johnson said he has no idea whether any loans will be
taken out.
   Simon spokesman David Carle said that after paying off remaining
bank debt Thursday the campaign had around $300,000 in cash on
hand. Simon has scaled back his operation, laying off about 15
people at the campaign headquarters, on the heels of more than 250
layoffs after the Iowa, New Hampshire and Super Tuesday contests,
Carle said.
   Simon collected about $60,000 at a Chicago event Monday night,
and expected to bring in another $25,000 Thursday night in New York.
   A mailing to Simon's 50,000 contributors will go out next week,
and unsolicited donations came in following Simon's victory in his
home state of Illinois, Carle said. He declined to give specific
figures.
   Simon will strongly contest Wisconsin, with a large TV campaign,
but will not buy ads in Michigan, he said.

   FBI Director William H. Webster may have been
``misinformed'' in 1985 when he defended continuing a terrorism
investigation into a group opposing Reagan administration policy in
Central America, a congressman said Thursday.
   The FBI's investigation of the Committee in Support of the
People of El Salvador was closed just two months later for lack of
evidence.
   At a congressional hearing Thursday, Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner
referred to Webster's testimony of April 17, 1985, in which the
then-FBI director, now head of the CIA, justified continuing the
CISPES investigation.
   But the inquiry ended in June 1985 following a review by the
Justice Department which concluded that CISPES was involved in
political activities involving First Amendment rights and not
international terrorism.
   Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said the shutdown such a short time after
Webster supported the investigation raised the question of
``whether there was this review going on when Webster made the
statement.''
   The congressman said he was certain that a decision ``was not
made quickly or rashly'' to close the terrorism investigation,
which had been going on since 1983, preceded by an earlier domestic
criminal investigation begun in 1981.
   ``I don't know if Webster was misinformed or what,''
Sensenbrenner said after raising the issue with current FBI
Director William Sessions at a hearing before the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights.
   Sessions confirmed his own statements of last month about the
investigation being closed in June 1985, but said any elaboration
would have to wait until an internal FBI review of the bureau's
handling of the CISPES inquiry is completed.
   In his April 1985 testimony before the same subcommittee,
Webster said ``we are not keeping track of the membership of CISPES
as such. There are, as in many organizations, a wide range of
individuals engaged in that organization, including some in whom we
have a legitimate independent foreign counterintelligence
interest.''
   Webster's comments came in response to complaints from Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., that a member of CISPES who had traveled to
Nicaragua had been interviewed by the FBI for ``intelligence
gathering'' purposes.
   After Thursday's hearing, CIA spokesman William Baker, who also
served with Webster at the FBI, noted that Justice Department
reviews of such probes take place annually and that go-aheads for
the CISPES investigation had been given twice previously based on
``a valid predication'' that there was a conspiracy to commit
terrorist acts.
   The investigation was based on circumstantial evidence, which
the FBI was unable to document, that CISPES members were sending
money to the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front, the main insurgent
group trying to overthrow the government of El Salvador.
   In January, the Center for Constitutional Rights released FBI
documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act showing
that the FBI had investigated CISPES extensively.
   The investigation included photographing protesters at peace
rallies and recording their license-plate numbers, investigating
nuns, union members and college students and checking up on church
forums, according to the documents.
   Last month, Sessions denied that the bureau had mounted a
massive surveillance campaign, but did acknowledge that the
investigation ``was not properly directed'' in all instances.

   Warplanes believed to be from Honduras
attacked a Sandinista military headquarters in northern Nicaragua
near the Honduran border, the presidential spokesman said Thursday.
   Manuel Espinoza Enriquez said the attack on Bocay caused no
injuries or damage. Sandinista troops fired on the planes, forcing
them to turn back to Honduras, he said.
   He said the planes fired at least five rockets at the
headquarters but did not say if any struck their target.
   The attack came a day after Honduras charged that Nicaraguan
troops had entered its territory while pursuing U.S.-backed Contra
rebels.
   President Daniel Ortega said Thursday that Nicaragua was ready
to ``combat and liquidate'' American troops sent to Honduras after
the reported incursion. He said his soldiers won't withdraw from
the border region.
   Ortega also called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to
deal with what he called ``one more escalation of the war against
Nicaragua.''
   ``We logically are going to maintain our offensive ... we are
not going to withdraw our troops now that we have recovered our
territory,'' he said.
   ``We are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the
82nd Airborne Division,'' he said.
   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Nicaragua already had
begun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about
2,000 Contra rebels back into Honduras.
   ``The operations have succesfully been concluded, and we don't
plan to stay along the border region. In fact, this deescalation
has already begun,'' the spokesman, Alejandro Bendana, said on
NBC's ``Today'' show.
   Ortega spoke to reporters before meeting with 14 opposition
parties ``to explain to them the national and international
situation.''
   The 3,200 U.S. troops that began arriving in Honduras on
Thursday include two battalions from the 82nd Airborne at Fort
Bragg, N.C.
   Ortega called the U.S. troop movement ``a dangerous act'' and
accused the United States of pressuring Honduras into asking for
the American presence.
   The C-141 planes carrying the U.S. troops were arriving every 30
minutes at Palmerola air force base, the main center of U.S.
military operations in Honduras. The base is about 125 miles west
of the border, where heavy fighting was reported Wednesday.
   Bendana denied U.S. and Honduran allegations that Sandinista
troops entered Honduras, and he invited the United Nations and
Organization of American States to visit the area to ``establish
what the facts are and end these accusations.''
   Ortega himself wouldn't say if Sandinista troops crossed the
border.
   ``Here the question is not if (Nicaraguan) army troops
penetrated Honduran tserritory or not, but that we have dozens of
camps of mercenary forces in Honduran territory, in view of and
tolerated by the Honduran government,'' he said.
   But Honduran military officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said about 4,000 Honduran soldiers were surrounding
about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers Thursday. The sources said the
entire Honduran military was on alert.
   Ortega told reporters the Nicaraguan ``invasion only exists in
the warped imagination of the North American leaders'' and said the
sending of American troops ``violates international law and the
regional peace efforts,'' he added.
   ``We demand that the United States withdraw its troops from
Honduras immediately and, with this, contribute to the meeting that
is going to be held in Sapoa March 21 having positive results,'' he
said.
   Government and Contra representatives are scheduled to begin
three days of peace talks Monday in Sapoa, a town in southern
Nicaragua near the border with Costa Rica.
   Ortega said the United States would use the current situation to
give the Contras logistical and military aid not approved by
Congress.
   At the United Nations, the Nicaraguan Mission confirmed that the
government plans to ask for a meeting of the 15-member Security
Council, the highest U.N. body.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuella called for
restraint in the conflicts but had not decided whether to send in
an observer team.

   Five current or former school bus drivers
were among seven people arrested in an investigation into drug
dealing and marijuana use, officials said Wednesday.
   More arrests are expected.
   ``The problem was so great, we decided not to end this
operation,'' said Officer Wayne Hoskins of the department's Drug
Enforcement Unit. ``To me, this is one of the biggest things we've
done. These guys were driving busloads of kids around. That bothers
me as a citizen, not just a cop. My kids have rode those buses.''
   Hoskins said Officer Harold Robinson posed as a bus driver to
gather evidence. Robinson made a drug buy within a week of being
hired Jan. 8, police said.
   ``He let it be known he was looking and it went down that
quick,'' Hoskins said. ``It's really unbelieveable how bad it was.
We're talking about a lot of people involved in drugs down there.''
   Linda Ethridge, president of the Waco Independent School
District board, said the police investigation was prompted by a
school district request.
   She said the WISD conducts background checks on those hired as
bus drivers, but that sometimes those reviews fall short. There are
about 150 drivers in the district.
   Board members have in the past discussed whether to start
drug-testing of drivers and will likely take up the matter in the
future, she said.
   Jafus Cavil, vice president of the school board, said he doubted
if the board could establish a drug-testing policy because ``I
think there are some legal problems to it.''
   Federal agents arrested the current and former drivers Monday
and Tuesday. The three current drivers were fired.
   Hoskins said police monitored the drivers suspected of using
drugs to ensure they were capable of driving.
   The undercover officer found both marijuana and cocaine sold and
used at the bus barn before morning routes, Hoskins said.

   A group of anti-apartheid activists called on
the South African government Wednesday to commute the death
sentences of six blacks who were involved in a 1984 demonstration
during which a black deputy mayor was killed.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women and
a member of the Free South Africa Committee, said the government of
Prime Minister P.W. Botha was using the death penalty in an effort
to intimidate the country's black protest movement.
   She likened such tactics to those of Nazi Germany, contending
that the Pretoria government is ``on the road to totally
obliterating all blacks except those who accept slavery.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz telephoned South African
Foreign Minister Roelof (Pik) Botha to protest the plans to execute
the six, department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   A protest also was delivered to the South African government by
U.S. diplomats in Pretoria.
   ``As the president said yesterday, we do hope that the South
African government will heed this call for clemency,'' Redman said.
   Speaking at a news conference, Yard urged Congress to approve
stronger sanctions and require total withdrawal of American
business interests from South Africa.
   NOW was joined at the session by representatives from
TransAfrica, the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and
the National Conference of Black Lawyers, as well as aides to
presidental candidate Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Rep. Mervyn
Dymally, D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.
   The groups praised the Reagan administration for joining the
British and West German governments in asking for clemency in a
telegram to Botha.
   At the same time, they urged President Reagan to end diplomatic
relations with South Africa and ask the Western allies to join in a
trade embargo.
   ``We've seen what this government can do against Poland and
Panama,'' Yard said ``Why not South Africa?''
   The South African prisoners, known as the Sharpeville Six, were
convicted in the Sept. 3, 1984 killing of black township councilor
Jacob Dlamini in Sharpeville, about 40 miles south of Johannesburg.
   Evidence at their trial indicated that the six were not among
those who hacked and burned Dlamini to death. They were convicted
under the doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which holds that they
were responsible for the killing by being part of the mob that
gathered outside of Dlamini's home with intent to kill him.
   Michael Prosper, of the lawyers committee, told the news
conference that Dlamini, who refused to leave his home when South
African police tried to take him to safety, had incited violence by
firing several shots into the crowd.
   The plea for clemency also is supported by Amnesty
International, the United Auto Workers, the National Coalition
Against the Death Penalty, the National Council of Churches and
other national religious groups.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
200,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement between the two countries, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 200,000 tons of
corn would be about 7.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices recently have been averaging about $1.83 per bushel
at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of
around $14.5 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 3.47
million tons of corn, plus more than 6.9 million tons of wheat;
813,300 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<HEAD>Big Moment For Lacroix in Ready-to-Wear Openings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix scored a solid success in his
first ready-to-wear show Wednesday, keeping hemlines short and
flirty.
   His show capped the first day of a big week for buyers and press
who come to view what Paris has to say about next winter's clothes.
The consensus is that many influential designers plan to keep their
skirts short. Others will set hemlines zooming down.
   Paris wonder-boy Lacroix was most successful in his daytime
clothes. His late-day dresses were inspired by Moroccan folklore
and the dance hall, a departure from the ``Arlesienne'' look of
previous collections.
   He had hinted he would show very simple clothes, but couldn't
resist some occasional fantasy, and his offerings were anything but
dull.
   The show started with a bang: hot-colored coats in all shapes
from swirly trapeze to fitted, often with big fichu collars. The
little suits in houndstooth checks or plaids with fitted jackets or
tiny boleros were geared more to daily life then some of the
costumey lines in his couture collections.
   Simplicity, however, took away none of the pizazz of these
outfits, which are priced ultra-moderately compared to his ``luxe''
or couture lines. Made for him by Genny of Italy, the ready-to-wear
ensembles are expected to sell for about $420 to $1,060.
   Top sellers in this collection may be the fabulous silk jacquard
full-skirted coat-dresses in coral, yellow and blue.
   Lacroix was ebullient, with a fun-and-games approach in hats
such as an animal-spotted stovepipe or tipped pyramids, to go with
little satin beribboned ballerina shoes.
   He went in for some of his favorite full taffeta babydoll
dresses with bows or pyramid shapes. His fluid black jersey
waistless or fitted dresses with asymmetrical hemlines, topped by
dresses with big white organza collars might appeal as well _ to
those with conservative tastes.
   The fancier numbers included some ribbed sweaters with
embroidered net tops over flying bright skirts. There were merry
widow dresses too, complete with music-hall tights that had lace
and garter effects under the full, bouncy skirts.
   In a circus vein, he branched out into some loud and crazy
patchwork dresses with woolen balls and ribbons.
   The dressier silk or velvet outfits with Moroccan jewelry and
lace embroidery did not come off as well in this collection as the
beautifully finished simpler clothes. But the audience loved it all
anyway, and gave him a big hand for his peppy approach.
   In contrast to Lacroix's exuberance, Lolita Lempicka's
collection featuring mannish suits was down-to-earth to the point
of boredom.
   In greys and black pinstripes with ties, the outfits had long
pleated or short lean skirts, some of the jackets fitted, other
spencer-style for office chic. More mannish looks featured
trousers, making a comeback.
   Streamlined long and loose princess coat dresses were winning in
sober silvery grey, black or brown light wools.
   The satin and lace evening looks made an attempt at gaiety with
their bubbling scalloped skirts, but they didn't quite hit the
mark. And lace sleeves on man-tailored jackets over knit knickers
were not quite successful in their androgynous aim for a
masculine-feminine line.
   Doby Broda went in for sweaters on more sweaters _ a pullover
V-neck topped by a cardigan with a shoulder shrug, sometimes over
cuffed long or pedal-pusher pants. Her skirt lengths in low-key
outfits of mauve, beige or violet were either well above the knee
or nearly to the ankle.
   Kimijima's ``Venetian Carnival'' show was all in good fun,
especially the evening wear with huge peplumed bright taffeta
skirts, some harlequin-motif underskirts, and embroidered fitted
tops.
   Chantal Thomass _ known as ``queen of lingerie'' _ toned down
some of her risque touches in a bright, appealing show featuring
lots of pink angora and black stockings with vine-like motifs up
the front.
   Her wrapped tops over very short lean or bubbled skirts were
offset by some ankle-length numbers, often in soft pastel knits.
Equally appealing here might be the long and full cuffed pants and
the coats _ either full trapeze style or in sober charcoal and
white stripes fitted like short redingotes.

<TEXT>
   In the first such cooperative effort with the
People's Republic of China, federal agents arrested three men in
San Francisco in connection with a 7-pound heroin shipment from
China to the United States tucked away inside dead goldfish, the
Drug Enforcement Administration said Wednesday.
   The goldfish were laden with Southeast Asian heroin which was
sewn inside condoms, said DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty. Boxes
of fish containing the heroin and bound for a business called the
Goldfish Aquarium in San Francisco were spotted by authorities in
China on March 9.
   DEA and U.S. Customs Service agents were alerted and authorities
seized the heroin in China.
   Most of the heroin was later resewn inside some of the fish,
which were placed in the bottom of each of 20 boxes containing 50
to 60 live goldfish and shipped to the United States aboard an
aircraft. A Shanghai police official and a DEA agent from Hong Kong
accompanied the shipment to San Francisco.
   The boxes were deposited in a cargo area and attached with
transponders emitting a signal so that DEA and Customs agents could
keep the boxes under electronic surveillance.
   Two men picked up the boxes in San Francisco and delivered them
to the aquarium, where they were opened by three people then
arrested by agents who had trailed them to the location. The three
were arrested last Friday. In addition, four people were arrested
in China in connection with the shipment.
   The DEA said it was the first time the United States and
mainland China had worked together on a controlled delivery of
heroin from China to the United States.
   Tally bookmaking sheets also were recovered at the aquarium
building, suggesting it was an illegal sports betting
establishment, Dougherty said.

<HEAD>House Budget Committee Approves $1.1 Trillion Federal Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Budget Committee approved a $1.1
trillion federal budget for the 1989 fiscal year Thursday that
obeys Congress' budget summit accord with President Reagan, but
scrambles some of his domestic spending priorities.
   The spending plan would leave a deficit of $134.1 billion,
according to the budget panel, enough to avoid automatic spending
cuts under the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.
   The budget resolution, expected to be sent to the full House
next week, was pieced together over the last several days during
closed-door meetings among committee Republicans and Democrats. The
panel approved the document, on a voice vote with no objections,
during a five-minute public session.
   ``We've had a bipartisan process, with full participation by
Republican members,'' said committee Chairman William H. Gray III.
   The bipartisan camaraderie was in stark contrast to last year,
when Republicans walked away from the budget resolution process and
bickering lasted for months.
   But the budget pact reached last November between Reagan and
lawmakers locked in new taxes and spending levels for fiscal 1988
and 1989 for defense, foreign affairs and overall domestic spending.
   Lawmakers are proving eager to avoid reopening those questions
and sparking potentially bitter fights in an election year. Thus,
the main fight remaining has been over how to distribute the $169.2
billion the summit allows for the domestic programs that Congress
directly oversees and are not financed under automatic formulas.
   ``The key was the budget summit, which gave us the key ceilings
for the spending categories which are usually most controversial,''
said Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr. of Ohio, senior committee
Republican at the meeting.
   In the 1989 budget he presented Congress Feb. 18, Reagan
proposed a 20 percent increase in spending on space and science
programs to $13.1 billion. The budget panel, looking to restore
proposed cuts to several other domestic programs, pared that
increase to $12.2 billion.
   ``The committee felt that was a realistic figure for NASA to
carry out its mission,'' Gray said.
   Where Reagan proposed deep cuts in programs such as mass transit
assistance and eliminating other programs such as federal aid to
Amtrak, the passenger railroad, the budget committee would retain
current levels of spending or reduce it by 1 percent or 2 percent.
   For programs for low-income people such as job training and
child health care, the budget panel's proposal would allow enough
of a spending increase to keep up with inflation, expected to reach
4 percent this year.
   The committee's budget also rejects $1.2 billion in savings in
Medicare that Reagan had proposed, spends $1.5 billion for AIDS
research _ slightly more than the president proposed _ and retains
previously planned levels of spending for education, fighting drugs
and providing aid to the homeless.
   The panel also proposed a 3 percent pay raise for federal
workers and civilian employees of the military. Gray said lawmakers
will have to decide later this year whether members of Congress
would qualify for the salary increases.
   The committee's budget leaves intact the summit agreement
spending levels of $294 billion for military programs for the 1989
fiscal year, and $14 billion in new taxes. Most of the levies are
on corporations.
   The Senate plans to write its budget resolution next month. The
resolution does not need the president's signature, and it serves
as a blueprint for actual spending legislation to be enacted later.
   The lawmakers chose the path of least political resistance in
selecting the crucial economic assumptions that determine how
healthy the government's balance sheet will appear.
   Thus, to weigh the budget deficit, the lawmakers adopted the
economic assumptions used by the president's Office of Management
and Budget. The committee chose not to use economic figures
calculated by the Congressional Budget Office, which has said red
ink is actually $35 billion greater than OMB estimates.
   Under Gramm-Rudman, the deficit target for next year is $136
billion. The law states that spending would be automatically cut to
that level if the deficit exceeds the target by $10 billion.
   The 1989 fiscal year begins Oct. 1.

   The presidential candidates who made it
through the costly Super Tuesday and Illinois contests are now
lining up fund-raising events to see them through the rest of the
primary season.
   Some of the most cash-draining states are yet to come _ New
York, Pennsylvania, California and Ohio.
   Vice President George Bush has no money worries, and GOP rival
Pat Robertson has already shelled out nearly all he can legally
spend. But the Democrats continue hunting for cash for their
generally lighter treasuries, and Republican Sen. Bob Dole is also
seeking contributions.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri both are scrimping along, looking to draw enough
contributions to keep their campaigns afloat beyond caucuses on
March 26 in Michigan and primaries March 29 in Connecticut and
April 5 in Wisconsin.
   The Democratic money leader, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
has ``an active April fund-raising schedule,'' and remains in good
financial shape, a spokesman said.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson, whose fund-raising has trailed that of
opponents, has been picking up money through an aggressive mail
program, and will appeal for money in California this weekend.
   Arlie Schardt, a spokesman for Sen. Albert Gore Jr., said the
campaign was ``in the black'' and had ``a sufficient amount of
money to do what we need to do.''
   ``We're in good solid shape,'' he said, but refused to provide
any details.
   Bush's schedule includes a handful of dinners and receptions
through April, and then he can close up his fund-raising shop. That
is because he will have brought in as much as he can spend on his
primary campaign under election law rules, said campaign treasurer
Fred Bush, who is no relation to the candidate.
   The limit is $27 million, and the campaign figures on another $2
million or so for legal and accounting costs, which are exempt from
the limit.
   Money has been pouring into the Bush coffers as he heads to
all-but-certain nomination this summer.
   The vice president's push down the fund-raising home stretch
included a $1,000-a-person dinner Thursday night in Washington, for
which 170 people were signed up and another two dozen had to be
turned away, said the campaign treasurer.
   In addition to the events, Bush will mail one more appeal to his
70,000 or so donors who have not yet ``maxed out'' with the $1,000
maximum contribution they are allowed to give.
   Bush currently has more than $4 million in cash on hand,
spokeswoman Ede Holiday said Thursday. Although he has nearly
raised the limit, he can continue campaigning because he has not
spent it all.
   In a different situation is GOP rival Robertson, the former TV
evangelist, who must drastically scale back his campaign operation
to avoid exceeding the spending limit.
   Robertson has said he will rely heavily on volunteer efforts to
see him through the rest of the campaign.
   Dale Tate, a spokeswoman for Sen. Dole of Kansas said that after
Dole's poor showing on Super Tuesday and in Illinois, receipts had
not ``fallen off precipitously.''
   In fact, she said, people have been calling unsolicited to
pledge money and urge him not to drop out.
   ``These are Republicans saying we think there should be a
race,'' she said.
   On Friday, callers pledged $140,000, on Monday $95,000 and on
Tuesday $60,000, she said. Still, she added, ``we're not bathing in
dollars,'' and no decisions on TV advertising have been made for
the campaign's next targeted state, Wisconsin.
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said the campaign raised $100,000
Wednesday night in New York and is focusing on raising money for
the New York and Pennsylvania primaries. Dukakis' strong showing in
the 20-state Super Tuesday contests on March 8 has kept money
flowing to him, he said.
   Dukakis has about $1.5 million in the bank, not counting the
more than $600,000 he got this week in federal matching funds, said
spokesman Leslie Dach.
   For Simon and Gephardt, both of whom did poorly in the Super
Tuesday races, the situation was not so bright, although both said
they were not in debt.
   Both also said they had record fund-raising months in February _
Gephardt collecting $1.2 million and Simon more than $900,000. A
Simon spokesman conceded, ``March will not be a record for us as
February was.''
   ``It's a day-to-day thing,'' said Gephardt's spokesman Mark
Johnson. ``We're using aggressive fund-raising'' techniques, mostly
involving phone calls to contributors. ``You're at a point now
where cash flow is very important, and you need a quick
turnaround,'' he said.
   Gephardt is is targeting Michigan for a heavy advertising
campaign, but Johnson said he has no idea whether any loans will be
taken out.
   Simon spokesman David Carle said that after paying off remaining
bank debt Thursday the campaign had around $300,000 in cash on
hand. Simon has scaled back his operation, laying off about 15
people at the campaign headquarters, on the heels of more than 250
layoffs after the Iowa, New Hampshire and Super Tuesday contests,
Carle said.
   Simon collected about $60,000 at a Chicago event Monday night,
and expected to bring in another $25,000 Thursday night in New York.
   A mailing to Simon's 50,000 contributors will go out next week,
and unsolicited donations came in following Simon's victory in his
home state of Illinois, Carle said. He declined to give specific
figures.
   Simon will strongly contest Wisconsin, with a large TV campaign,
but will not buy ads in Michigan, he said.

   Susan Butcher, winner for the third year in
row of the 1,150-mile Iditarod Sled Dog Race, is a transplanted
Easterner who pursues the arctic sport with a passion.
   Her victory was less than four minutes old Wednesday night, but
the intense, 34-year-old from Manley Hot Springs already was
thinking about next year's race _ and about breaking the magic
10-day mark.
   ``I think it can be done, and I'd like to be the one to do it,''
said Butcher, who crossed the finish line in 11 days, 11 hours and
41 minutes, a record for the race's longer northern route from
Anchorage to Nome.
   The record she broke was her own, set in 1986. Last year, her
winning time of 11 days, 2 hours set a record for the shorter
southern route.
   Butcher has run the race 11 times, finishing second twice and in
the money _ or among the top 20 _ all but once, in 1985, when she
scratched after a cow moose charged her 17-dog team, killing one
animal and injuring five others.
   Butcher is an outgoing, strongly built woman who works out daily
along with teams from her 150-dog kennel. She once took four dogs
to the summit of Mount McKinley, at 20,320 feet, the highest peak
in North America.
   Dave Monson, her lawyer husband, shares her passion for dog
racing and several weeks ago won the equally challenging Yukon
Quest International Sled Dog Race from Fairbanks to Whitehorse in
the Yukon Territory.
   Butcher grew up in Cambridge, Mass., moving to Colorado when she
was 16 along with two Siberian huskies she had bought as pets.
There she worked as a veterinary technician.
   She moved to Alaska in 1975 because she was looking for a
wilderness lifestyle.
   Butcher married Monson two years ago and they live 140 miles
from Fairbanks in a 16-by-19-foot cabin with no running water and a
gas-driven generator for electricity. She draws water for her 150
dogs from a nearby creek.
   Of her $50,000 Iditarod first-place prize in 1986, ``every cent
went back into the kennels,'' she said.
   ``I train them 12 months of the year,'' Butcher said in a recent
interview. ``In summer I run dogs in harness pulling a four-wheel
cart. Once the snow starts falling, I run eight to 10 to a team
from 10 to 50 miles a day.''
   ``They're worth $1,000 to $6,000 apiece, so they're precious,
besides the emotional involvement,'' she said.
   ``They love competition. They're professional athletes, and I'm
more like a coach. Coaching to victory is the job of a musher. The
formula for winning is one-third musher, one-third dogs and
one-third luck.''

   Israel began its first major trials on
Thursday of soldiers charged with brutality in the Arab rebellion,
and Palestinians wounded an Israeli with gunfire for the first time
since the violence began Dec. 8.
   Israeli warplanes raided Palestinian guerrilla bases in the
mountains south of Beirut, and newspapers said Secretary of State
George P. Shultz may return to the Middle East early next month to
promote the U.S. peace plan. The raid came a day after rockets
landed in northern Israel, causing light damage.
   Authorities increased restrictions in the occupied territories,
which already include travel bans and a cut-off of telephone
service to the outside. A military official said Palestinians must
get approval to bring $1,000 or more from neighboring Jordan, where
most hold citizenship and have family.
   The rules are intended to hamper the Palestine Liberation
Organization in organizing and financing the protests.
   Trials beginning Thursday involved the burial alive of four
Arabs by an army bulldozer Feb. 5 in Kfar Salem, a West Bank
village, and the beating Feb. 24 of two Palestinians near Nablus,
which was photographed by a CBS News crew.
   Neighbors soon rescued the buried Palestinians. The beating was
televised around the world and aroused international protest.
   Several weeks after trouble began in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the army introduced a policy of beating rioters as an
alternative to firing live ammunition. At least 100 Palestinians
have been killed in more than three months of violence, and
hundreds wounded.
   Yair Nissimi and Dror Segen-Cohen, both army privates, pleaded
guilty in the burial case to reduced charges of shameful behavior.
The plea bargain would give Nissimi 2{ months in jail and
Segen-Cohen two months, and both would be placed on probation.
   A three-judge panel is to rule March 29 on whether to accept the
arrangement.
   Sgt. Maj. Charlie Danino pleaded innocent to assault and
unbecoming conduct, and is expected to argue that he was not at the
scene.
   Mustafa Hamdan, one of those buried, said of the plea bargain:
``They buried four people alive. If an Arab did that they would
have given him 200 years.''
   Defense lawyer Josef Danai said in court the burial was ``an
instance of letting off steam, revenge and deterrence'' by soldiers
in difficult circumstances.
   ``They spilled a little earth on them,'' he said. ``The tractor
driver said an ant could have gotten out of it.''
   Sgt. Amichai Vaturi, who was at the scene but is not charged,
testified that the Arabs were covered with about two feet of wet
earth but their heads and shoulders were exposed.
   Hamdan said the heads of three men were covered.
   In the beating case, Sagi Harpaz and Yehuda Angel, army
privates, pleaded innocent to assault and the case was recessed.
   Two other soldiers were sentenced Tuesday to 10 and 21 days in
jail for minor roles in the beating.
   In the Gaza Strip, a 25-year-old Khan Yunis resident, Subhi Abu
Sharar, was shot in the chest and seriously wounded, said Ilana
Ziv, spokeswoman for Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon.
   Arab reports said Israeli soldiers shot him during a
demonstration.
   Also in Gaza, two Arabs shot 44-year-old Israeli contractor Adi
Tzabari four times in the legs near Jabalia refugee camp, Ms. Ziv
said.
   Tzabari told Israel army radio ``I threw a hammer'' at one Arab
with a pistol, ``then another one appeared with a Kalashnikov
(assault rifle) and opened fire.''
   The army confirmed the shooting. It was the first time an
Israeli, civilian or soldier, has been reported hit by Arab gunfire
since the beginning of what Palestinians now call ``the uprising.''
   An Arab truck driver in the same area tried to run down an
Israeli soldier earlier Thursday but the soldier escaped without
injury, the army said.
   Arab reports from Jabaliya said the army fired tear gas and
rubber bullets at 800 schoolgirls who stoned soldiers, raised
Palestinian flags and burned tires.
   Officials of a U.N. clinic said 25 girls were treated for minor
injuries. Palestine Press Service, an Arab-run news agency, said
soldiers in the West Bank arrested 150 Palestinians overnight in
Nablus, Jenin, Qabitiyeh, Ramallah and Hebron.
   Arab reporters said the army blocked dairy and produce
deliveries to Nablus, Tulkarm and Jericho.
   The army said these reports were being checked.

<TEXT>
   Planeloads of U.S. soldiers
streamed into this air base Thursday in a show of strength ordered
by President Reagan to counter what he called an invasion by
Nicaraguan forces.
   In northern Nicaragua, warplanes raided a Sandinista military
headquarters Thursday, but no casualties or damage resulted,
Nicaragua said. A Reagan administration source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed in Washington that Honduras
launched the raid, but called it ``totally a Honduran operation.''
   Two battalions from the renowned 82nd Airborne Division of Fort
Bragg, N.C., and two battalions from the 7th Light Infantry
Division of Fort Ord, Calif., were combined into a task force of
3,000 troops.
   A Honduran official said his government had given the
Sandinistas 24 hours to get out of the country, which they entered
in pursuit of Contra rebels.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua responded that his army was
``ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the 82nd
Airborne Division.''
   Maj. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commander of the 82nd Airborne, said
he knew of no plan to have U.S. troops enter into the battle
between the Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed -Contras.
   ``We have not been told to do so,'' he said before leaving Fort
Bragg. He said the force was capable of that, if needed.
   The American troops were to engage in joint exercises with the
Hondurans.
   Stiner also said there was no plan to use the troops if more
trouble broke out in nearby Panama.
   The American forces began arriving at Palmerola at 10:15 a.m. as
part of what the Pentagon called operation ``Golden Pheasant.''
   The 26 C-141 transport planes landed in the intense heat at
30-minute intervals at this air base, headquarters of U.S. military
operations in Honduras, 40 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa.
   The deployment was about 125 miles west of the area where Reagan
administration officials say the Nicaraguan Sandinista army has
chased rebel Contra forces over the border into Honduras.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, Honduran armed forces spokesman,
said the deadline for the Sandinistas to leave was final.
   He said 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers had crossed the border and
penetrated about six miles in pursuit of Contra rebels. A military
intelligence source said earlier the Nicaraguans were surrounded by
about 4,000 Honduran troopers.
   Suarez Benavides would not comment on Pentagon reports of new
Nicaraguan attacks inside Honduras.
   The Sandinista movements did not appear to be a full-fledged
invasion, Stiner said, adding that he saw the U.S. operation as a
deterrent.
   Ortega would not say whether his soldiers had crossed the border
in pursuit of the U.S.-supported rebels.
   ``Here the question is not if army troops penetrated Honduran
territory or not, but that we have dozens of camps of mercenary
forces in Honduran territory, in view of and tolerated by the
Honduran government,'' he said at a news conference in Managua.
   He said Nicaraguan soldiers would not withdraw from the border
area. Ortega called the U.S. troop deployment ``a dangerous act''
and ``another escalation of the war against Nicaragua.'' He
demanded a meeting of the U.N. Security Council.
   A spokesman for the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry said before the
news conference that Nicaragua had begun pulling its troops back
from the frontier region after driving about 2,000 Contra rebels
back into Honduras. The Defense and Foreign ministries denied that
Nicaraguan troops entered Honduras.
   Nicaraguan presidential spokesman Manuel Espinoza Enriquez later
said that air attackers fired at least five rockets Thursday at the
Nicaraguan military headquarters at Bocay, near the Honduras
border. Sandinista gunfire forced the planes to turn back, he said.
   The U.S. official in Washington said two Honduran air force F-5s
and four Super-Mystere attack jets carried out the assault,
destroying a Soviet-built helicopter on the ground.
   Heavy fighting was reported Wednesday in the Olancho border
province about 125 miles east of Palmerola.
   Included in the American forces are two battalions from the 82nd
Airborne and two from a new division organized for quick movement
around the world. The 82nd Airborne and 7th Light Infantry are
based at opposite ends of the country.
   The final 800 U.S. troops are to arrive Friday by parachute,
weather permitting.
   In addition to the C-141 aircraft, a giant C-5A transport was
loaded with helicopter gunships for the exercise.
   The Honduran intelligence source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said: ``We will not allow the Sandinistas to move
farther into the interior of our territory. We want to avoid a
large conflict, but if it isn't possible, we will have to face the
invading troops.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in Washington the
soldiers were not being sent in ``a shooting capacity'' but to
``get people's attention to what is happening in Central America''
and say to the Honduran government: ``We are your friends.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the complete
deployment would take about 27 hours. The Defense Department said
the soldiers had their normal weapons along with nine helicopters
and two light tanks.
   It was the the most dramatic show of U.S. force since the
Contras began fighting in Nicaragua six years ago, and came in
response to a request for help from President Jose Azcona Hoyo of
Honduras.
   Since 1981, Honduras has been a key U.S. ally in Central America
and a major element in Reagan administration policy of fighting
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   About 1,100 American soldiers normally are stationed at several
military installations in Honduras. In addition, other national
guard and army troops rotate through for joint exercises,
road-building and other projects.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A House committee chairman called Wednesday
for the resignation of a high-ranking Education Department official
who was quoted in a published report as saying students at black
colleges include ``a high level of thieves.''
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, said the remarks by Deputy Undersecretary
Bruce Carnes make him ``incapable of objectively carrying out his
duties. He is not qualified for this or any position in federal
government.''
   In a story Tuesday about a crackdown on student loan defaults,
the Wall Street Journal quoted Carnes as saying: ``The sector that
will be hit hardest by this will be black colleges. It's possible
that their student bodies contain a high level of thieves.''
   But Carnes said in a statement that ``I have no recollection of
saying that or anything remotely like that. It's completely at
variance with everything I have said before on this topic, and with
what I believe.''
   Gary Putka, the reporter who wrote the story, said he has
Carnes' comment in his written notes and stands by the quote. ``He
hasn't denied it to us nor has he asked us for a correction or
retraction,'' Putka said.
   In a letter to the Journal, dated Tuesday, Carnes said the
newspaper article ``has grievously misrepresented my views
concerning black colleges and their students. In fact it ascribes
to me a view that is precisely the opposite of the one I hold and
have repeatedly stated.''
   Education Department spokesman Loye Miller said the letter did
not demand a retraction because the newspaper would have refused to
publish it that way.
   Hawkins called on Education Secretary William Bennett to remove
Carnes from his position if Carnes did not resign. Hawkins also
said he had written to President Reagan about the incident.
   Miller said Carnes has repeatedly said he does not believe
stiffer penalties and enforcement in the area of student loan
defaults will be a special problem for historically black colleges.
   Miller also said he has heard Carnes rebuff people who say such
colleges need an exemption from the default crackdown because their
students are less reliable about paying back loans.
   In his letter to the Journal, Carnes said students at
historically black colleges ``are as capable as others of meeting
their commitments.'' He said the department is holding workshops
and seminars to help historically black colleges with high default
rates manage their student loans.

<HEAD>Democratic Candidates Attack GOP on Iran-Contra, Troop Deployment</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 9th graf pvs, bgng: Bush spokesman, with
Dukakis endorsements</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT FURLOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contenders debated long-distance with
Republican Bob Dole Thursday over the dispatch of U.S. troops to
Central America, with Richard Gephardt charging the administration
had ``abandoned the rule of law.''
   Dole called for U.S. military help for the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels, who he said were being ``slaughtered by the hundreds.''
   But Jesse Jackson, campaigning in Michigan, said, ``We are being
told we have to be saved from the Sandinistas. There are no
Sandinistas in Detroit.''
   Jackson also included Vice President George Bush, the GOP
presidential front-runner, in his verbal attack. Commenting one day
after former White House aide Oliver North and three other men were
indicted for their roles in the Iran-Contra money diversion,
Jackson said, ``In a real sense, the mailmen have taken the rap for
the postmaster.''
   ``North and the others are fall guys in the process. ... This
investigation must conclude the fact that this is President
Reagan's policy and the fact that Mr. Bush knew about the scheme,''
he said.
   Sen. Paul Simon said of the troop deployment, ``I'm skeptical
like a lot of my colleagues. I don't know what I can trust from the
administration.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis not only criticized the
administration's Central American moves but also laid into Bush for
refusing to break with Reagan over a civil rights bill the
president vetoed on Wednesday.
   Reagan has complained the bill would expand federal power, and
he has offered a substitute. But Dukakis said, ``There's a very
basic principle involved here. That is that institutions which
receive money from the government should not discriminate.''
   Bush spokesman Pete Teeley said the vice president has not
publicly discussed his views of the issue, and he said, ``We're not
going to respond to Dukakis.''
   Dukakis, meanwhile, made the rounds on Capitol Hill on Thursday,
picking up the endorsements of several lawmakers _ Sen. Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Sen. Donald
Riegle and Rep. Howard Wolpe, both of Michigan.
   Pat Robertson, still in the GOP race but apparently making only
a token effort the rest of the way, was hoping to bring in needed
cash at a California fund-raiser.
   Bush and Dukakis had fund-raising events on their schedules,
too, and so did Illinois Democratic primary winner Simon, as the
candidates took advantage of a primary season lull to catch their
breath and pick up campaign money for the series of big-state
primaries next month.
   Dukakis praised Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk and New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo for their recent comments against deciding
the party's nominee at a brokered convention _ as Simon has said is
inevitable _ and in favor of settling the matter beforehand.
Dukakis paraded new endorsements from two senators whose states
have already voted _ Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Patrick Leahy
of Maine _ and sought support from two others _ Bill Bradley of New
Jersey and Donald Riegle of Michigan.
   The Massachusetts governor also compared himself to former Vice
President Walter Mondale, who lost the general election in a
landslide to Reagan after a tough fight to win the nomination in
1984.
   ``This is a long process,'' Dukakis said of his wins and losses
in primaries so far. ``Mondale in '84 lost a whole string of
primaries and pulled it out, numerically, with New Jersey. If
there's one campaign that's doing it primary by primary, caucus by
caucus, it's this campaign.''
   Gephardt was campaigning hard in Michigan ahead of March 26
caucuses there. The Missouri congressman, who fell far behind
Dukakis, Sen. Albert Gore and Simon on Super Tuesday, is traveling
the state in a bus while his 80-year-old mother, Loreen, has been
making the rounds of radio talk shows in Detroit.
   Gore was on the campaign trail, too, but was having weather
problems in Kansas, where Democratic caucuses will be held Saturday.
   The Tennessee senator, who bypassed the year's lead-off contests
in Iowa and New Hampshire, got a taste Thursday of the cold, snowy
campaigning he missed in those states. He greeted workers arriving
at a Boeing plant in Wichita, which had been hit by late-winter
snow. And his next stop in Pittsburg, Kan., was canceled because
the airport there had no de-icing equipment.
   Gore, in a news conference later in Topeka, was less critical
than several of his Democratic rivals of the Reagan
administration's sending of troops to Honduras. But he did say, ``I
think it was wrong to mislead the Congress and fail to provide the
information about what led up to the decision.''
   He also said, ``I think the president erred in not virgorously
pursuing'' a peace plan offered by the president of Costa Rica.
   Dole, in a speech on the Senate floor, declared that the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels were being overrun and ``slaughtered by
the hundreds,'' and he said Reagan should immediately resubmit a
request for military aid.
   ``Does it make sense, even as thousands of communist troops
cross the border of a free country in this hemisphere, for members
of Congress to make excuses for (Nicaragua's) aggression, while
accusing the president of the United States of fueling the fires of
war in Central America?'' Dole asked.
   Gephardt, however, in a statement released by his office in
Washington, strongly criticized Reagan for sending troops to
Honduras.
   ``Now we have this overreaction that puts American troops in
harm's way,'' he said. ``This `exercise' serves no purpose but to
draw us into a war that the American people oppose.''
   Gephardt said, ``In pursuit of its failed policy of support for
the Contras, the administration has lost its sense of direction,
abandoned the rule of law and failed to protect American national
interests in a troubled region.''
   Dukakis said to reporters in Boston that the decision to send
troops was ``very regrettable.''

<HEAD>Army Says It Will Purchase West German Reconnaissance Vehicle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army announced Wednesday it had decided to
begin purchasing a specialized West German military reconnaissance
vehicle rather than continue development of its own.
   The decision ultimately could be worth $790 million to West
Germany and demonstrates the U.S. commitment ``to NATO
standardization and cooperation,'' the Army said.
   The decision involves a unique type of wheeled reconnaissance
vehicle outfitted for use in a battle zone contaminated by either
nuclear radioactivity or biological and chemical agents.
   The West German version of the vehicle is known as the
``ABC-Spuerpanzer FUCHS'' and is made by Thyssen Henschel of
Kassel, West Germany. The U.S. Army calls the German vehicle the
``Fox NBC Reconnaissance Vehicle.''
   ``The Fox wheeled vehicle has been in service with German forces
since 1979,'' the Army said. ``A version of it has been recently
fielded as a reconnaissance vehicle with imbedded nuclear and
chemical detection, warning and navigation equipment.
   ``The Army will adopt (this) vehicle ..., terminating funding
for the XM87 NBC Reconnaissance Vehicle program.''
   Maj. Randy Morger, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Army intended
to purchase six of the Fox vehicles in the near future for about $1
million each in order to perform final acceptance tests.
   Ultimately, the service may spend about $790 million to acquire
576 of the vehicles. That pricetag would include adding some
additional sensor, data processing and radio equipment to the
vehicle, Morger said.

   Planes from Honduras attacked a
Sandinista military headquarters in northern Nicaragua at noon
Thursday, but President Daniel Ortega's office said they caused no
casualties or damage.
   Reporters on the scene confirmed the raid, which came the day
after Honduras accused the Nicaraguans of sending thousands of
soldiers across the border in pursuit of U.S.-supported Contra
rebels.
   A Reagan administration source in Washington said the Honduran
air force had carried out the attack. However, a Honduran armed
forces spokesman in Tegucigalpa, the capital, denied the armed
forces had crossed into Nicaragua and said rockets were fired at
Sandinista forces in Honduran territory.
   More than 3,000 American soldiers began arriving in Honduras in
a show of support Thursday. Ortega declared his army ready to
``combat and liquidate'' the Americans and said his soldiers will
not withdraw from the border region.
   Nicaragua has committed an estimated 6,000 soldiers to an
anti-rebel operation in an area running from the central region to
the border, with most of them at the frontier.
   Manuel Espinoza Enriquez, spokesman for Ortega, said the attack
on Bocay, near the border, caused no injuries or damage. He said
Nicaraguan soldiers fired on the planes, forcing them to turn back.
   At least five rockets were fired at the headquarters, he said,
but did not say whether any hit the target.
   The U.S. official in Washington said two U.S.-built F-5s and
four Super-Mystere attack jets of the Honduran air force carried
out the assault, destroying one of Nicaragua's Soviet-made
helicopters on the ground.
   ``This was totally a Honduran operation,'' the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Honduras has one of Central America's smallest armies and relies
on air superiority for defense. It and Mexico are the only nations
in the region with jet fighters.
   Manuel Suarez, the Honduran armed forces spokesman, said in a
telephone interview that the air force dropped at least five bombs
inside Honduras along the border region near Bocay. He said he had
no further information.
   Ortega called the dispatch of U.S. troops to Honduras ``one more
escalation of the war against Nicaragua'' and demanded a meeting of
the U.N. Security Council.
   A council meeting Thursday about British military maneuvers in
the Falkland Islands became an impromptu debate of the U.S. action,
with barbs exchanged by Nicaragua and Panama on one side and the
United States on the other.
   In Managua, Ortega said: ``We logically are going to maintain
our offensive. ... We are not going to withdraw our troops now that
we have recovered our territory.
   ``We are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the
82nd Airborne Division.''
   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Nicaragua already had
begun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about
2,000 Contra rebels back into Honduras.
   ``The operations have succesfully been concluded, and we don't
plan to stay along the border region. In fact, this deescalation
has already begun,'' the spokesman, Alejandro Bendana, said on
NBC's ``Today'' show.
   Ortega spoke to reporters before meeting with 14 opposition
parties ``to explain to them the national and international
situation.''
   The 3,200 U.S. soldiers who began arriving in Honduras on
Thursday include two battalions from the 82nd Airborne at Fort
Bragg, N.C.
   Ortega accused the United States of pressuring Honduras into
asking for the American presence.
   The C-141 planes carrying the U.S. troops were arriving every 30
minutes at Palmerola air force base, the main center of U.S.
military operations in Honduras. The base is about 125 miles west
of the border, where heavy fighting was reported Wednesday.
   Bendana denied U.S. and Honduran allegations that Sandinista
troops entered Honduras, and he invited the United Nations and
Organization of American States to visit the area to ``establish
what the facts are and end these accusations.''
   Ortega himself wouldn't say if Sandinista troops crossed the
border.
   ``Here the question is not if (Nicaraguan) army troops
penetrated Honduran tserritory or not, but that we have dozens of
camps of mercenary forces in Honduran territory, in view of and
tolerated by the Honduran government,'' he said.
   But Honduran military officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said about 4,000 Honduran soldiers were surrounding
about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers Thursday. The sources said the
entire Honduran military was on alert.
   Ortega told reporters the Nicaraguan ``invasion only exists in
the warped imagination of the North American leaders.''
   ``We demand that the United States withdraw its troops from
Honduras immediately and, with this, contribute to the meeting that
is going to be held in Sapoa March 21 having positive results,'' he
said.
   Government and Contra representatives are scheduled to begin
three days of peace talks Monday in Sapoa, a town in southern
Nicaragua near the border with Costa Rica.
   Ortega said the United States would use the current situation to
give the Contras logistical and military aid not approved by
Congress.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuella called for
restraint in the conflict but had not decided whether to send in an
observer team.

   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel met with a
group of Estonian-Americans protesting the visit of a Soviet
government minister, Hodel's spokesman said Wednesday.
   Hodel ``listened to their concerns about threats to the
environment from phosphate mining, and human rights,'' and
reiterated American support for Estonian aspirations, said
spokesman David Prosperi.
   Estonia is one of the three Baltic countries who declared
independence on the breakup of the czar's empire in 1917 and were
taken over by the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Nazi-Soviet pact
of 1939. The United States still accords diplomatic recognition to
the governments-in-exile of the three countries, Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania.
   Geology Minister Y.E. Kozlovsky paid a courtesy call on Hodel
after visiting the U.S. Geological Survey, part of Hodel's
department.

<HEAD>Interior Department Rejects Iroquois Gas Pipeline Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Interior Department said Wednesday a
proposed 358-mile Northeast natural gas pipeline is unacceptable
because its route across the Appalachian Trail would create scenic
and environmental problems.
   But the project developer vowed to work with federal park
officials to find a new route across the hiking trail that would be
acceptable.
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel, in a letter to Sen. Lowell
P. Weicker Jr. R-Conn., said he rejected the Iroquois proposal
because the pipeline would cross the 2,000-mile Appalachian Trail
at a point in New York near the Connecticut border where it would
have ``significant environmental and scenic impacts.''
   Gary B. Davis, spokesman for the Iroquois Gas Transmission
System, said he was confident the company could find a route across
the trail that would satisfy Hodel.
   ``The plan now is to find a place along the New York-Connecticut
border where we can cross,'' Davis said. ``We will have to sit down
with the Park Service again and discuss our concern. ... Something
will have to be worked out.''
   The pipeline, which would begin in Ontario, would have to cross
the Appalachian Trail at some point on any route to Long Island
because the trail runs from Maine to Georgia. The pipeline would
serve Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.
   The $384 million project is the first and most prominent
Northeast gas line proposal under consideration by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.
   But Deputy Assistant Interior Secretary Susan Recce said the
U.S. Park Service, which is under the Interior Department, has
jurisdiction over anything affecting the Appalachian Trail, which
is part of the national park system.
   Hodel's ruling was based on the recommendation of a Park Service
survey in January.
   The pipeline would have crossed the Appalachian Trail at Dover,
N.Y., in eastern Dutchess County, N.Y., near Sherman, Conn. Davis
said that site was chosen becaue AT&T telephone lines already cut
across the trail there.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday
took its first procedural step in reviewing the applications of 31
Northeast projects. Iroquois was the first application submitted,
nearly two years ago.
   ``It's important because a procedure is now moving forward,''
Davis said. ``After 22 months, finally FERC is starting to take
some action on our application.''
   The licensing consideration is going ahead under traditional
FERC guidelines.
   Iroquois had pushed to have the project considered under a
``fast-track'' procedure that would have avoided a series of
lengthy hearings. But that attempt, opposed by Weicker and other
officials in Connecticut, has been in effect been abandoned by the
company, Davis said.
   Opponents argued that the fast-track procedure was designed for
smaller projects.

   A domestic jetliner with 137 people
aboard crashed during a storm in the northern Colombia mountains
Thursday and burst into flames, with no immediate sign of
survivors, officials said.
   The Boeing 727 had just left Cucuta, about 250 miles northeast
of Bogota, and crashed on a mountain near Zulia, police at the town
said, quoting witnesses. Zulia is about 50 miles north of Cucuta.
   The Civil Aeronautics Agency, which reported the Avianca flight
missing soon after takeoff, said it could not confirm the crash. It
said two search planes and three helicopters searched for the
aircraft in the remote mountainous region where it was reported to
have crashed.
   Zulia police said three witnesses reported that the plane
clipped some trees, then slammed into a mountain and burned, and
they saw no survivors.
   Passengers included a Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop and
members of two Colombian soccer teams.
   ``We heard a tremendous noise ... and ran toward the mountain
where we saw the ruins of the plane,'' said Victor Pineda
Villamizar, a schoolteacher, in an interview with the radio network
RCN.
   The teacher said local rescuers could not reach the crash site,
which he said was at about 8,000 feet.
   In Bogota, Col. Edgar Lozano, a spokesman for the government air
transport agency, said the search would continue at dawn Friday.
Civil Defense, police and Red Cross search teams suspended their
efforts late Thursday.
   According to the government agency, the plane left Cucuta near
the Venezuelan border at 1:16 p.m. for Barranquilla, a Caribbean
port 250 miles northwest, and then was to continue to the port city
of Cartagena.
   Avianca and the government air transport agency reported the
plane left with 131 passengers and six crew members. The agency and
airline earlier had given different numbers.
   The agency said the control tower at Cucuta lost radio contact
with the plane four minutes after takeoff as the aircraft traveled
in stormy weather. The agency said the plane did not report
mechanical problems.
   ``It was on the route, but it was flying at a very low
altitude,'' said a spokesman at the control tower, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The agency said the passenger list included a Roman Catholic
auxiliary bishop, Monsignor Horacio Olave Velandia of Tibu, and at
least 31 soccer players from two teams who were flying to a
tournament in Cartagena.
   Olave Velandia, 44, was named an auxiliary bishop last month.
The soccer teams were affiliated with the state petroleum company
Ecopetrol.
   Colombia's last major air crash occurred July 27, 1985, when an
air force transport plane went down in the Amazon jungle, killing
74 people. It was carrying passengers because of an airline strike.
   The Boeing 727 began flights in 1963 and is currently being
flown by more than 170 carriers. The 727 was the best-selling
jetliner in history until it was recently surpassed by the 737.

   An explosion and fire touched off
by a mislabeled or contaminated gas cylinder struck a chemical
plant Thursday, killing three men and seriously injuring one,
officials said.
   The fire at the Gollob Analytical Services plant burned out of
control for more than 4{ hours. Officer David Bogert said he felt
the early morning blast from the police station 1{ miles away.
   The blast occurred after an employee of a distributor arrived to
remove the cylinder at Gollob's request because tests showed it did
not contain the nitrous oxide ordered, said state Environmental
Commissioner Richard T. Dewling.
   The tank ``either was mislabeled or contaminated somehow,'' and
Gollob had asked it be removed immediately, Dewling said.
   ``From there on we don't know what happened,'' he said. ``We
don't know whether they were loading it onto a truck, moving it or
what.'' He said it is not known whether the cylinder itself blew up
or leaked gas that caused an explosion.
   The fire gutted the one-story, 10,000 square-foot cinderblock
building and forced the evacuation of about 30 night-shift workers
in nearby buildings, officials said.
   Fire Chief Michael Amodeo said the three men who died were found
outside the plant and appeared to have been trying to escape.
   Dewling would not identify the distributor of the gas, saying
the matter was under investigation. Gollob, which has been in
business for 22 years, tests chemicals.
   A department manager and a technical director were killed in the
blast and fire, officials said. The third person killed had not
been identified.
   James Diemer, 30, of Leonia, was injured, and one leg was
amputated below the knee at University Hospital in Newark, said a
nursing supervisor.
   Authorities said it was not immediately known whether he worked
for Gollob or the distributor.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government of President Leslie
Manigat vowed Wednesday to crack down on narcotics trafficking, but
made no specific mention of the U.S. indictment of Col. Jean-Claude
Paul on drug charges.
   A communique signed by Martial Celestin, the prime minister and
minister of justice, and by Foreign Affairs Minister Gerard
Latortue, declared:
   ``The government ... reiterates its determination to struggle
against drug (trafficking) ... and confirms its desire to cooperate
with foreign governments in the struggle against drug trafficking
in which Haiti could be used as a point of transit.
   ``In any precise case implicating an individual or institution .
.. the government would appreciate receiving ... a complete file,
solidly documented with evidence, which would be transferred to
(judicial) authorities.''
   A federal grand jury in Miami on March 9 indicted Paul, his
brother and Paul's former wife in connection with a 220-pound
shipment of cocaine allegedly flown to the Bahamas in a plane that
left Paul's ranch outside the capital Port-au-Prince. The cocaine
was said to be Florida-bound.
   Paul, a battalion commander in Port-au-Prince, denied the
charges, and Haitian officials said they never were officially
notified of the indictment.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite, however, said Ambassador
Brunson McKinley personally notified Manigat last Thursday. Lite
said a complete judicial file will be delivered to the Haitian
government within two weeks.
   The indictment was seen as putting Manigat in a touchy position.
He came to power in a Jan. 17 election that rival candidates said
was rigged by the army.
   Radio stations meanwhile reported Wednesday that the Chamber of
Deputies almost unanimously approved the Cabinet proposed by
Manigat and Celestin, with minor changes.
   Manigat has been without an official Cabinet since taking office
Feb. 7.
   Parliament rejected a proposed Cabinet last Thursday, arguing
that the state could not afford to maintain 14 ministries.
   Agreement on a Cabinet was reached Tuesday evening.

<HEAD>British Troops Take Off In Practice Airlift For Falklands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIZE NORTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of British troops took off
Wednesday night on an 8,000-mile practice airlift to reinforce the
remote Falklands Islands garrison in the South Atlantic.
   The first of up to 10 transport planes carrying 900 troops
departed at about 10 p.m. from Brize Norton Royal Air Force base,
60 miles northwest of London, said a Defense Ministry spokesman,
who was not identified in keeping with British custom.
   It was part of Britain's controversial Fire Focus military
exercise, which marks Britain's first major drill in the Falklands
since it won a 1982 war with Argentina over the islands. The 25-day
exercise began March 7.
   Phantom fighter jets and other planes will fly in from other
British bases, Royal Air Force spokesman Michael Hill said.
   Argentina, backed by other Latin American nations, has called
the $690 million troop movement ``aggravating.'' Britain insisted
it is defensive.
   In the Falklands, Gen. Neil Carlier told reporters at Mount
Pleasant airport ``it is much cheaper to mount an exercise like
this than to hold a vast number of people down here at taxpayers'
expense which might also, perhaps, send out the wrong signals.''
   Carlier called the nature of the exercise misunderstood and said
the airlift was needed because ``we've just set up in a new base
and not yet had the opportunity to prove the system for having
reinforcements.''
   The 2,000 troops stationed on the South Atlantic archipelago
were placed in a state of high readiness to prepare for the arrival
of the reinforcements Thursday and Friday, he said.
   The reinforcements will include troops taking the role of the
enemy. Advance personnel, equipment and reporters arrived Tuesday.
   Britain built the airport after the 1982 war to accommodate
wide-bodied jets which could be used to rush troops there in the
event of a build-up of tension in the region.
   In 1982, Argentine forces invaded the islands. Lack of a
suitable runway forced Britain to form a naval task force that took
weeks to reach the islands.
   Britain recaptured the colony after a 74-day conflict which
killed 712 Argentines, 255 Britons and three Falkland Islands
civilians.
   Argentina, 200 miles west of the islands, claims it inherited
the Falklands from Spanish colonial days and that they were stolen
by Britain, which has ruled them as a colony since 1833.
   The 1,900 islanders, most of British descent, say they prefer
British rule.
   This month, the Organization of American States voted 25-0 to
urge Britain to reconsider the exercise. The United States and St.
Lucia, a former British colony, abstained.

   A federal energy official said Wednesday the
planned superconducting super collider is generating widespread
interest abroad, but several lawmakers said the project is
threatened by a lack of financing and firm commitments from
interested foreign countries.
   James F. Decker, the Energy Department's acting director for
energy research, told a House subcommittee that the government
hopes to get up to 40 percent of the estimated $4.3 billion cost
from foreign and non-federal sources.
   Decker said recent Energy Department missions to Rome, Paris,
London, Bonn, Geneva, Tokyo and Ottawa found high interest in the
project at every stop, with indications that financial support will
be forthcoming.
   ``The discussions with Japan and other countries were fairly
significant and give us reason to believe there will be
contributions,'' Decker said at a hearing of the House subcommittee
on international scientific cooperation.
   Asked repeatedly about specific commitments, Decker said it was
premature to obtain them.
   ``All countries were interested in the scientific phase and some
would contribute to the construction phase as well,'' Decker said,
predicting that contributions would be in goods and services rather
than cash.
   Potential contributor nations ``will be watching support in
Congress this year and your decision will guide theirs,'' Decker
said.
   That prompted Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., to describe financing
as a ``chicken and egg situation'' since Congress is waiting to see
how much outside money will be contributed.
   It's a ``Catch-22 predicament in which the department says it
can't get foreign money until domestic spending for SSC is
approved, and we respond that we can't permit domestic spending
until enough foreign money has been committed,'' said Rep. Sherwood
Boehlert, R-N.Y.
   ``We've got to have some help from other countries,'' said Roe,
chairman of the full Science, Space and Technology Committee.
   The government is spending $25 million on super collider
preparations this year and has requested $363 million for 1989.
   Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., said he has found in talks abroad
that theoretical physicists were highly enthusiastic about the U.S.
project and ready to lobby for financial support of it with the
less-enthusiatic officials of their governments and research
institutions.

<HEAD>Vietnam Accuses China of Blocking Rescue of Freighters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam charged Wednesday that Chinese
warships attacked three Vietnamese freighters near disputed islands
in the South China Sea, then blocked rescue efforts.
   China blamed Vietnam for the raid and said some Chinese were
wounded in the exchange of gunfire. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li
Jihua refused to say how many people were hurt.
   Vietnam has not reported any casualties.
   The official Voice of Vietnam radio said the freighters had been
on fire since the attack Monday near Sinh Ton Island in the Truong
Sa archipelago, which Vietnam claims.
   The islands, also known as the Spratly Islands, are claimed by
China, Taiwan and the Philippines.
   ``The Vietnamese side sent lifeboats flying Red Cross flags to
rescue those freighters, but they were obstructed by Chinese
warships,'' said the Vietnamese broadcast, monitored in Bangkok.
   ``The Vietnamese side urged the Chinese side to order its
warships to move away from this area and not to prevent the
Vietnamese ships from coming to the rescue of the crews on these
freighters. The Vietnamese side wishes a favorable and early reply
from the Chinese side,'' it added.
   The radio said Vietnam's Foreign Ministry made the charges in a
meeting Wednesday with Li Shuching, Beijing's ambassador to Hanoi.
   Vietnam said the clash began when three Chinese warships opened
fire without provocation on two Vietnamese freighters. The warships
then fired on other Vietnamese freighters that came to the rescue,
the radio said.
   But Ms. Li of China's Foreign Ministry said Vietnamese naval
ships fired on Chinese vessels and on teams doing a scientific
survey on a reef.
   Ms. Li refused to disclose how many Chinese were wounded,
whether they were civilians or military personnel or other details.
   Vietnam had charged that Chinese naval vessels interferred with
Vietnamese cargo ships near the archipelago on Jan. 31.
   There are believed to be oil deposits near the archipelago,
about 300 miles south of China's Hainan Island.
   China was a major arms supplier to the Vietnamese Communists
during the war against the French and the Americans, but relations
later deteriorated and the two countries fought a 17-day border war
in 1979.

   China's most famous journalist, ousted from the
Communist Party last year for his reports critical of the
government, will spend a year in the United States on a fellowship,
his wife said Wednesday.
   Liu Binyan, a reporter and writer whose stories uncovered
official corruption and inefficiency, was a winner of Harvard
University's prestigious Nieman Fellowship, his wife Zhu Hong said.
She said he will leave Friday.
   The former senior reporter for the official People's Daily will
teach at the University of California in Los Angeles for two months
before going to Harvard in the fall, she said.
   Liu, 63, was expelled from the party in 1957 and again in
January 1987, when he was accused of vilifying the party and
attacking Marxism. He was dismissed from his post at People's
Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, in May 1987.
   However, he has remained vice chairman of the Chinese Writers'
Association.
   In a statement on Liu's expulsion, the party charged that he
``confounded right and wrong and spread slanderous rumors.''
   Liu was one of three prominent intellectuals ousted from the
party in the campaign against ``bourgeois liberalization,'' or the
favoring of Western ideas, that began after student demonstrations
in support of democracy flared across China.
   Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, accused of inciting the student
protests, and writer Wang Ruowang were also purged.
   Liu, who taught himself English, had a standing offer from
Harvard since 1983 to take the Nieman Fellowship, which is given
each year to a handful of American and foreign journalists, Zhu
said.
   Publication of three of Liu's books was suspended and a ban was
put on the sale of a collection of his articles, called ``Tell You
a Secret,'' after his ouster from the party.
   He has not been able to publish anything since.
   Liu's writing, whether investigative reporting or fiction, has
long irritated officials.
   During the ``hundred flowers'' movement in 1956, when
intellectuals were encouraged to express themselves, Liu wrote
``Bridge Worksite,'' in which he criticized a group of bureaucrats,
and a novel, ``News Behind the News,'' about the ideological
struggles and politics at a newspaper.
   Both works were branded ``poisonous weeds'' in the crackdown the
next year, and Liu was expelled from the party and sent to work as
a janitor.
   He was barred from writing for more than 20 years.
   During the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Liu was accused
of being a Soviet spy and a traitor, sent to a labor camp and

   He was quoted as saying it was the worst period in his life and
only the thought that ``no one would know the truth'' prevented him
from committing suicide.
   Liu was rehabilitated in 1979 and joined the staff of the

   A truck carrying a crane knocked out supports
below a freeway overpass under construction Wednesday, dislodging a
22,000-pound steel beam that killed the driver and pierced a car's
roof, officials said.
   The driver of the car escaped injury, fire Capt. Ron Cervantes.
   The truck driver, who was not immediately identified, was
driving about 35 mph when the crane struck the beam's metal
supports. The beam crushed the driver's compartment, Cervantes said.
   Wood and other construction debris from the overpass smashed on
to the busy Interstate 5 in the 1:30 p.m. accident 15 miles north
of downtown San Diego, closing the northbound route between San
Diego and Los Angeles.
   ``It was like Lincoln Logs, falling and collapsing all around
the crane truck,'' said motorist Ellen Williams, who saw the
accident from a freeway ramp.
   The truck driver had a state permit to use the freeway but
apparently violated a prohibition against driving in areas with low
clearance, Cervantes said. The construction material had reduced
clearance under the overpass, he said.
   Construction crews working on the overpass were uninjured.

   Cathy Evelyn Smith, the rock 'n' roll
groupie who admitted giving comedian John Belushi the
heroin-cocaine ``speedballs'' that killed him in 1982, was freed
from prison Wednesday after serving 15 months.
   Ms. Smith, 40, a native of Canada, faces immediate deportation,
said Joe Flanders, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   She was paroled from the California Institution for Women in
Frontera after serving the full term imposed, said Hal Tanner,
chief deputy superintendent. She was a model prisoner, he said.
   Ms. Smith accompanied Belushi, the manic comic who parlayed his
popularity on the ``NBC Saturday Night'' TV show into starring
roles in such movies as ``Animal House'' and ``The Blues
Brothers,'' on a drug binge that ended in a bungalow at the Chateau
Marmont hotel on Hollywood's Sunset Strip.
   Belushi, 33, was found dead March 5, 1982, in the bungalow.
   Ms. Smith later admitted she and the comic injected
``speedballs,'' a potent combination of cocaine and heroin, but
denied any responsibility for his death.
   She fled to Canada but returned in 1986 to plead guilty to
involuntary manslaughter and furnishing and administering a
controlled substance. She originally was charged with second-degree
murder and drug counts, but accepted a plea bargain.
   She will appear within a few days at a deportation hearing,
Flanders said.
   Ms. Smith has been a companion and backup singer for such
entertainers as Hoyt Axton and Gordon Lightfoot and has been
acquainted over the years with members of the Rolling Stones and
The Band.

   Guatemala called Wednesday for a
meeting of Central American foreign ministers to discuss crises in
Nicaragua and Panama, but the planned session fell through,
officials in Costa Rica said.
   A Costa Rican Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition
he not be identified, did not say why the talks could not be
arranged.
   He said Guatemala's Foreign Ministry had called for the meeting
of the five countries that signed a peace accord last August.
   The ministers were to discuss ways to mediate a solution to the
Panama crisis, in which opposition forces and the United States are
pressing for the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of the
Defense Forces.
   The meeting also would have addressed Nicaragua's military
offensive against Contra rebels on the country's border with
Honduras, the official said. Honduran officials and the Reagan
administration said the Sandinistas crossed into the neighboring
country during the offensive.
   Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto, Costa Rica's foreign minister, told The
Associated Press earlier Wednesday his government was particularly
preoccupied with the increased fighting in Nicaragua, which
occurred just before the Sandinista government and the Contras were
to hold three days of cease-fire talks.
   The talks are scheduled to take place in the southern Nicaragua
town of Sapoa on Monday.
   President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica won the Nobel Peace Prize
for sponsoring the peace plan, which called for talks between
insurgents and governments in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Madrigal Nieto also expressed concern about Panama, where a
group of officers tried unsuccessfully to overthrow Noriega on
Wednesday. Thousands of Panamanians angry about his rule and the
government's inability to pay their salaries poured into the
streets.
   ``What happened today in Panama shows there is a very delicate
situation in Central America that does not cooperate with the
pacification efforts that have come about,'' the foreign minister
said.
   The Central American peace plan calls for cease-fires in El
Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua, an end to outside support for
the area's insurgencies, and negotiations aimed at installing
democratic governments, among other points.

   Loma Linda Medical Center said
Wednesday it has agreed to care for a second baby born with only a
brain stem in hopes that her organs can be used for transplant.
   The newly arrived infant, a girl identified only as Baby
Cassandra, was born Tuesday at a small hospital in Texas with a
fatal condition known as anencephaly, in which most of the brain
and skull are missing.
   ``At her parents' request, the infant was incubated and placed
on a respirator,'' Ms. McClintock said in a statement.
   Dr. Joyce Peabody, chief of neonatology at the medical center,
said Baby Cassandra already is very close to meeting the clinical
criteria for brain death. Once that occurs, her organs will become
available for transplant.
   An anencephalic infant already at the hospital, Baby D, has not
shown the required signs of brain death after six days on a
respirator, lessening the chance that major organs can be taken
from him, spokeswoman Joyce McClintock said.
   Loma Linda has developed the nation's first medical guidelines
for preserving anencephalics' hearts and other vital organs for
transplant to critically ill infants.
   Under the guidelines, infants are placed on life-support systems
for seven days. If doctors declare an infant brain-dead within that
time, organ procurement agencies are alerted and a search for a
suitable recipient begins.
   If the infant is not declared brain dead within seven days, it
is taken off the respirator and allowed to die naturally. Such a
death causes the organs to deteriorate, rendering the heart and
liver unsuitable for transplant.
   However, heart valves and corneas are usable and have been taken
from other babies who died after being removed from respirators.
   The hospital's format was devised to address ethical questions
surrounding the use of doomed anencephalics used as organ donors.

<HEAD>Reagan Stands Firm on Peace Plan Despite Shamir Complaints</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs to UPDATE with Shamir comments at dinner.
^By TERENCE HUNT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Wednesday he will not
revise or abandon an American plan for Mideast peace talks even
though Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir complained that it was
``not conducive to peace.''
   Ending two hours of talks with Shamir in apparent deadlock,
Reagan warned that opponents of the U.S. proposal face certain
consequences.
   ``They'll need to answer to themselves and their people as to
why they've turned down a realistic and sensible plan to achieve
negotiations,'' the president said, standing alongside an unsmiling
Shamir during a White House departure ceremony.
   Reagan said Shamir did not specifically say ``no'' to an
international peace conference demanded by Jordan's King Hussein
with U.S. support.
   However, Shamir made clear that he rejected the idea. ``I have
strong reservations concerning the proposed international
conference, which in my view is not conducive to peace,'' he told
reporters.
   Shamir last October accepted a proposal by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz to hold direct talks with Jordan under U.S. and
Soviet auspices. ``I shall be ready to consider a similar
proposal,'' he told Reagan.
   However, Hussein has rejected the idea, holding out for a
full-scale international conference, and a senior U.S. official
said: ``Standing by itself, there would not be much point in
presenting that again.''
   The official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said
Reagan and Shamir dealt almost exclusively with differences over
the international conference.
   He said they did not review Israel's concerns about the U.S.
proposal that it cede at least part of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
it has held since the 1967 Six-Day War in exchange for recognition
by Arab nations.
   Shamir met for 20 minutes with a group of black congressmen who
raised their concerns about Israel's handling of the violence in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Israel's ties with South Africa.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., who heads the Congressional Black
Caucus, said he was ``dissatisfied'' with the short time alloted to
the meeting, saying it precluded serious discussion.
   Shamir will wrap up four days of talks Thursday with another
meeting with Shultz. ``We are where we expected to be,'' the U.S.
official said, since Shamir did not come to Washington with a
decision by the Israeli Cabinet on the U.S. plan.
   Shultz had hoped to convene the peace conference next month and
to open negotiations May 1. He asked for a prompt reply from Israel
and the Arabs. ``We are not setting our watches on any of them,''
the senior official said.
   But he stressed the need to make arrangements rapidly.
   At the departure ceremony in the East Room, Reagan promised to
work to strengthen U.S.-Israeli ties during his final months in
office.
   Without specifically mentioning the three months of Palestinian
rioting and the Israeli crackdown in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, he said the talks focused on the search for peace in
the Middle East.
   ``We've seen a new sense of urgency on the part of many in the
region, and a wide recognition of the reality that the status quo
is unacceptable,'' the president said.
   He said ``the present situation is a challenge and an
opportunity to move decisively to break the deadlock that has
lasted far too long. I hope we will not lose this opportunity.''
   Reagan said the U.S. plan ``offers a realistic and achievable
way to change the relationship between Israel and the Arabs. ... So
let's be clear about several things: the United States will not
slice this initiative apart and will not abandon it.''
   Explaining Reagan's stand later, the senior U.S. official said,
``You start pulling it apart, it's not going to be workable.''
   While rejecting the ntion of an international conference, Shamir
said, ``Israel firmly believes that those who are prepared to live
with each other in peace must learn to negotiate directly with each
other.''
   The U.S. official tried to put a positive face on the talks. He
said ``there was essentially no slamming of the door'' by Israel
and that the tone of the talks was excellent.
   Despite the apparent impasse, the president sought to reassure
the hesitant Israeli leader that the United States would not allow
terms to be dictated at a peace conference and shared Shamir's
distrust of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The official paraphrased Reagan as saying that peace cannot be
made under violence and terrorism.
   ``He said the PLO is revealing its real intent: no to peace and
yes to violence. We must find ways to give moderate Palestinians
and other Arabs a stake in the process.''
   Vice President George Bush, hosting a dinner for Shamir
Wednesday night at the State Department, assured him ``no wedge
will be driven between the United States and Israel.''
   Toasting Shamir, the vice president said: ``We are like
brothers; our two countries, friends and allies forever.''
   Shamir, in reply, said Israel was proud of its record as the
most consistent supporter of the United States in the United
Nations and of sharing military technology with Washington. He said
the U.S.-Israeli relationship ``is stronger than ever.''

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 students and
workers marched five miles through this capital Wednesday to
denounce approaching legislative elections and demand more money
for the National University of El Salvador.
   The march ended at the Treasury Ministry, where young men
wielding nail-encrusted clubs, their faces covered by bandannas or
ski masks, began jeering at troopers.
   The troopers fired tear gas, but the demonstrators set fire to a
half-dozen vehicles before they dispersed.
   Student groups at the university called the march to demand an
increase in the school's budget. It was joined by labor unions and
other organizations that sympathize with leftist guerrillas
battling the U.S.-backed government.
   The demonstration became more of a condemnation of Sunday's
legislative and municipal elections than a demand for increased
spending on education.
   Marchers carried posters ridiculing candidates of the governing
Christian Democrats and of the main opposition party, Arena, a
rightist group.
   Voters will choose mayors and councils in 262 municipalities and
fill 60 seats in the Legislative Assembly.
   Leftist parties are boycotting the vote. The guerrillas and
leftist union members say the elections are ``a farce,'' that no
free and fair balloting can be held in the middle of a civil war.
   Guerrillas from five leftist groups have been fighting since
1980 to overthrow the government. The war has killed about 65,000
people, displaced 500,000 and ravaged the economy.

<HEAD>Florida Says Nursing Homes Can Withhold Force-Feeding Of Dying
Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dying patients in Florida nursing homes
will not be forced to accept tube-feedings after July 1 under a
rule change instituted by the state Wednesday.
   ``It gives those choices back to those persons who are dying,
and not the state saying we're going to force you to accept a
tube-feeding,'' said Connie Cheren, director of the Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services' licensing office.
   Currently the department permits life-support sytems to be
turned off but does not allow feeding tubes to be withdrawn.
   That rule ``has basically been intrepreted that if the facililty
does not do the forced feeding, it must discharge the resident,''
said Ms. Cheren.
   The new rule ``does not relieve a facility's responsibility to
do all the palliative things like giving ice chips, holding hands
and rubbing the back, easing somebody through the dying stages,''
said Ms. Cheren.
   ``It's better because sometimes forced feeding is more harmful
to the person than helpful,'' she said. ``Sometimes taking the food
during the dying stages is more painful for the person because the
body is shutting down at this time.''

   Church leaders in this country and abroad
Wednesday urged clemency for the Sharpville Six, scheduled for
execution Friday in South Africa.
   Church officials also expressed appreciation to President Reagan
for asking South Africa to halt the execution on ``compassionate
and humanitarian grounds.''
   The six blacks, a woman and five men, all in their 20s or 30s,
were convicted in the 1984 death of Jacob Dlamani, black council
member of Sharpville township, in a demonstration of about 2,000
people.
   The human rights office of the U.S. National Council of
Churches, which includes most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox
bodies, urged that the six be spared.
   ``Their trial did not fulfill the norms of jurisprudence and
their executions will not serve the cause of justice in South
Africa,'' the council said. ``In God's name, grant clemency to the
Sharpville Six.''
   In a telegram to the South African government, the executive
council of the 1.7-million member United Church of Christ said:
   ``Since the judge in the case has admitted that none of the
defendants in the case has contributed causally to the alleged
crime, there is no basis for the proposed brutal punishment.
   ``We can only conclude that the planned executions are meant to
serve a political purpose in continuing efforts of your government
to deprive black South Africans of their political and human
rights.''
   From Geneva, Switzerland, the Rev. Emilio Castro, general
secretary of the World Council of Churches, sent messages to
ecumenical councils in a score of countries, urging them to ask
their governments to intervene with South Africa.
   Castro said the impending execution for an ``alleged role in
murder, which has not been proved in the case of any of the six
accused, according to the appeals court judge, is disturbing to
human conscience the world over.''
   Castro also urged continuing ``prayers of intercession for
victims and families of the apartheid system. ... May God restore
justice and peace to South Africans.''

   About 3,200 American infantry and airborne
troops are flying to Honduras today in the most dramatic show of
U.S. force in the six-year Nicaraguan war, causing the Senate's top
Democrat to accuse President Reagan of ``overreaction.''
   The White House described the movement as ``an emergency
deployment readiness exercise'' triggered by what it called the
invasion of Honduras by 1,500 to 2,000 Nicaraguan forces pursuing
Contra rebels.
   The exercise involves two battalions of the 82nd Airborne

   Members of Congress are skeptical about
whether the reported Nicaraguan military incursion into neighboring
Honduras is as large or as threatening as the Reagan administration
claims.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd called President Reagan's
decision to send 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras an ``overreaction,''
and a number of other legislators said they were still waiting for
hard evidence from the White House to back up its claims.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif, said: ``I think you
have to ask the question of whether 1,200 Nicaraguans going across
the Honduran border is a threat to U.S. national security,'' as
Secretary of State George P. Shultz had argued in an earlier
briefing for congressional leaders.

   ``The United States, disrespectful of international law and
disrespectful of the principles of the American constitution, is

U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   Ortega was reacting to an initial report by the White House that
the United States was considering ``everything ... short of
invasion'' after President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras accused
Nicaragua of sending troops across the border into his country and

   U.S. veterans are cheating the government out
of tens of millions of dollars each year by lying about their
incomes and collecting excessive benefits as a result, a

   The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
wing of Congress, compared Veterans Administration income forms
filled out by pensioners with Internal Revenue Service data.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, released the report Wednesday

appearances on ``Late Night with David Letterman,'' gets to act out
and expand on elements of her standup act in her first Cinemax
Comedy Experiment, ``Carol Doesn't Leifer Anymore,'' an ode to the
trauma of divorce, co-written by Leifer and ``Late Night'' writer
Fred Graver.
   The half-hour show, airing tonight as well as on March 20, 23,
28 and April 5, follows Leifer as she packs up to begin anew.
   ``I would say the motivation was definitely from real life,''
said Leifer, who is divorced in real life, ``because the gist of
the show is, oh, you get divorced and single life is going to be
great. You think you're going to be `That Girl!' You quickly find
out you're really going to be more like Miss Hathaway from `The
Beverly Hillbillies.'''
   As the piece opens, Leifer hits the road with enthusiasm, but
soon every song on the radio is about lost love and loneliness.
(That's Will Lee, the guitarist in the ``Late Night'' band, singing
``I'm Mr. Lonely.'') Then she stops at a gas station only to find
her moving men standing behind the van reading her diary.
   Once ensconced in her new place, she goes grocery shopping,
cleaning out the frozen dinner section and stocking up on cans of
instant whipped cream, which she squirts directly into her mouth in
times of stress _ like after strangling her aerobics teacher or
selecting just the right kind of condoms.
   When she does date, she decides she can't be too careful and
leads a prospective beau on a detailed recounting of his entire sex
life, complete with charts and pointer.
   Friends throw her a surprise party, and she meets a possible Mr.
Right. But he turns out to have a herd of kiddies and thinks
gourmet dining is to be found at the International House of
Pancakes. He orders the veal, prompting her to think, ``If he goes
for the syrup, I'm gone.''
   In real life, Leifer assures, ``I didn't really have that
nightmare of a date. I never really had a date who took me to get
his car inspected. I mean, it's never gotten that bad _ almost.''
   Leifer aspires to have a comedy series of her own, perhaps
something along the lines of ``It's Garry Shandling's Show.'' For
now, she still works the standup circuit, recently going as far
afield as the University of Alaska _ ``The woman who picked me up
at the airport said, `I don't know why we can't get entertainers
here.' I thought, `Oh, I don't know, maybe it's the 10-hour plane
ride?'''
   The former ``Saturday Night Live'' writer grew up on Long
Island, and it is middle-class suburbia more than feminism that
informs her comedy.
   ``I don't really think of myself as `a woman doing comedy,'''
Leifer said. ``That's not foremost on my mind. There a lot of jokes
in my act that a man could do. But there are also a lot of jokes
about my experience, which happens to be as a woman.
   ``I know when I go to watch comedy, I've never liked the kind of
women comedians who go out, and they kind of foster that separation
in the audience. They go out and it's a lot of, `Am I right,
ladies, am I right?' _ it's like, please, someone shoot me if I
ever say that. I just cringe.
   ``There are also a lot more women doing comedy,'' she said.
``But I think it's just a reflection of the times. I mean, there
are also a lot more women in prison, too.''

<HEAD>High School Sing Reaches Screen With Patti LaBelle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Above a pawn shop in downtown Toronto, Patti
LaBelle rips into a group of lackadaisical Brooklyn high school
students.
   In her first major dramatic role, the pop star is playing an
inspirational teacher in a movie musical based on Sing, the annual
song-and-dance competition in Brooklyn's schools.
   The legendary program at such schools as Erasmus Hall gave rise
to such talents as Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond. But with the
urban decay of the past decade, only a dozen schools now take part.
   The struggle to preserve that old Brooklyn spirit has inspired
the film, ``SING,'' with a plot centered on education board plans
to close a beloved high school where generations of immigrants got
their start.
   With songs from the writer of ``Footloose'' and ``Fame'' and a
tempestuous love story between a street-smart Italian kid and a
Jewish princess, the Tri-Star Pictures production now shooting in
Toronto is scheduled for release in February 1989.
   ``I'm hooked on it. I'm one of those people who think about
community and pulling together and family,'' said LaBelle, the
rhythm and blues artist who first hit the pop charts in the 1960s
with the Blue Bells and later in the '70s with the trio LaBelle.
She has appeared in two previous films, ``A Soldier's Story'' and
the TV movie ``Unnatural Causes.''
   In ``SING,'' she plays Mrs. Devere, an adviser who shakes her
junior class students out of apathy.
   ``She's very uplifting to the kids,'' Labelle said between takes
of her chart-targeted big number, ``Total Concentration,'' in which
she demonstrates how to put over a song.
   Producer Craig Zadan and screenwriter-lyricist Dean Pitchford,
who won an Academy Award for ``Fame,'' said they created the part
with LaBelle in mind and waited until she found time to do it.
   ``There's a real honesty there, nothing phony about her. In her
own way she's lived through what this teacher has gone through,''
said Pitchford.
   LaBelle has charmed the crew by introducing them to her own home
cooking _ fried chicken and potato salad. But she's not sure about
life as an actress.
   ``I'm not a Cher. I don't know if I'd have enough patience to do
another movie,'' she said, complaining about the number of retakes.
``It hurts enough some times that you want to cry. I like to
perform live.''
   However, director Richard Baskin, who co-produced Streisand's
landmark ``Broadway Album'' and is making his first feature film,
said LaBelle looked great in the first rushes.
   Co-stars include Lorraine Bracco who played Tom Berenger's wife
in ``Someone to Watch Over Me,'' Louise Lasser of ``Mary Hartman,
Mary Hartman'' fame and George Dicenzo who was Rob Lowe's boss in
``About Last Night.'' The young lovers are Peter Dobson and Jessica
Steen.
   For co-producer Neil Meron, a Brooklyn and Sing alumnus, the
project is a labor of love.
   ``In the high school I went to, Sing no longer exists,'' Meron
lamented. ``Brooklyn is one of the oldest communities in America,
and the way those communities found to express themselves was
through music and dance.''
   To research the film, the production team talked with veteran
teachers in Brooklyn and attended a Sing performance at Midwood
High School where faculty member Bella Tillis launched the program
in 1947.
   Sing competitions involved reviews or skits created and staged
by a committee from each class. The musical skits were judged on
sing night when freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors got to
strut their stuff. In the 1950s and '60s, when Sing was at its
peak, the competitions were fierce.
   Lyricist Pitchford also found inspiration in England, where he's
been working with the Royal Shakespeare Co. on the Broadway-bound
musical, ``Carrie.''
   ``After `Fame' the last thing I wanted to do was another high
school film set in New York about kids who sing and dance,'' he
said.
   ``But England has tradition and history we can only approximate
in America. The closest thing to that kind of longevity is in East
Coast settlements like Brooklyn. Sing became a metaphor for that
tradition.
   ``I developed an enormous affection for Sing and the
neighborhoods of Brooklyn and a real despair for the passing of
this tradition.''

<HEAD>Paul Dooley Plays Retiree While Own Career and Life Turn Busy</HEAD>

   Paul Dooley wanted to act in silent movies.
   He missed that by a few years, but he's done OK in the talkies
and is a member of director Robert Altman's repertory company. He's
also done fine right in television, most recently starring as super
private eye William J. Burns in the NBC miniseries ``The Murder of
Mary Phagan.''
   Now he is starring in a new series on CBS, ``Coming of Age.'' He
plays an airline pilot who is forced, kicking and screaming into
retirement in Arizona.
   The half-hour comedy also stars Phyllis Newman as his wife and
Alan Young and Glynis Johns as an incredibly happy couple in the
retirement village.
   ``It's funny. Here I am playing a guy who's winding down. In
real life I've got a rejuvenation, a new family and a new job,''
said Dooley.
   ``The whole reason I wanted to do movies was to do silent
pictures,'' he said. ``Of course, the silents were long gone. But
when I did `The Ed Sullivan Show,' my dressing room was across from
Buster Keaton's. A few months later we did a commercial together.
We played Keystone Kops. He was so sweet. He never seemed to gain
any sophistication.
   ``The thing I loved about Laurel and Hardy was that they were so
sweet to each other. One reason I didn't want to do a series was
that in so many I saw people insulted each other. In this my
character is retired, which is why he's unhappy. He complains about
the heat of Arizona and the boredom of retirement. I find the
character enjoyable. He has his frustrations, but he doesn't insult
people. Most of my conflict is with Alan Young. Why is he so
happy?''
   Dooley, 60, has three college-age children from his first
marriage. He remarried and has a 2{-year-old daughter, Savannah.
   Dooley says he often plays younger because his hair hasn't
thinned or turned gray. ``It gives me a longer career,'' he said.
   He grew up in West Virginia with the hope of becoming a
cartoonist. ``I drew a lot,'' he said, ``and I kept that ambition
until about halfway through college. I was at the University of
West Virginia at Morgantown. I was doing plays and finally switched
my major to drama. I had $50 when I graduated and drove an old
Dodge to New York. I had to keep it in a friend's driveway in
Brooklyn because I couldn't afford to run it.
   ``Don Knotts and I had been in college together and he got me my
first job in New York. He mentioned my name and I got a job on a
children's TV show, `Bobby Benson and the Bar-B Ranch.' I played
Don's nephew for about six months.''
   Dooley, who had been a teen-age juggler and magician, next
landed the role of Coocoo the clown on a Saturday morning show.
``I'd pull a string and a bird came out of my hat,'' he said. ``I
brought my whole bag of tricks with me and I'd perform at birthday
parties. It paid the rent.''
   He became a member of Second City's New York improvisational
group and at about the same time began to do television guest star
work and small parts in movies. He was in an Off-Broadway play
written by Jules Feiffer when director Robert Altman saw him.
   ``He was looking for the father of the bride in `A Wedding,'''
he said. Dennis Christopher played his son in that movie and later
in a non-Altman film, ``Breaking Away.''
   Dooley didn't do the TV series ``Breaking Away'' because by that
time he was off to Malta to play Wimpy in Altman's ``Popeye.'' He
wore a fat suit, a fake moustache and had to cut off most of his
hair.
   For the last 10 years he's done mostly movies, such as ``Sixteen
Candles,'' ``Health,'' ``Kiss Me Goodbye,'' ``A Perfect Couple,''
``Endangered Species'' and ``Big Trouble.'' He was also a regular
on ``The Dom DeLuise Show.''

   Comedian Paul Rodriguez says he has never
been happy with television, either as a performer or a viewer, but
is willing to give it another shot.
   Rodriguez and Eddie Velez co-star in the new CBS comedy ``Trial
and Error'' as two young Hispanic men who share an apartment but
little else in life. They are as mismatched as Oscar and Felix in
``The Odd Couple'' or Balki and Larry in ``Perfect Strangers.''
   ``The only unique thing about this is that I'm in it,'' said
Rodriguez, a standup comic. ``It's contrived, but it's an attempt
to get more Latinos into television. Who cares? It's a job. Maybe
it will open some doors to other Latino actors. I'm happy with
everybody for going out ot the way to make the show more accessible
to Latinos. I'm dubbing it in Spanish for simulcast over radio
stations in 10 cities.''
   Rodriguez plays Tony Rivera, a funky entrepreneur who makes his
living selling T-shirts to tourists. Velez is John Hernandez, a
clean-cut, ambitious young attorney.
   ``John is typical of a lot of Latinos whose ambition is to cross
over and assimilate,'' Rodriguez said. ``He thinks if you get a
college education, work 9-to-5, people are going to forget your
background and ask you to join the California Club.
   ``My character's philosophy is that if you have enough money you
can do anything you want. His whole thing is to get enough money to
tell the world where to get off. Of course, neither of us are
right.''
   He describes John as the kind of young man all Latinos want
their sons to grow up to be. ``And my character is the kind most of
them actually grow up to be,'' he said.
   His first series was the short-lived ``A.K.A. Pablo'' on ABC in
1984.
   ``I was not anxious to get back into television,'' he said. ``My
experience with `A.K.A. Pablo' was not happy. I was at the Comedy
Store when Norman Lear came into my life. The show was over-hyped.
When it failed I was blamed by Latinos for its image.
   ``This time I said I wanted to be more involved. I wanted to do
some writing. I suggested we call the show `East L.A. Law.'''
   ``Trial and Error'' originated as an idea by Tommy Chong (of the
comedy team Cheech and Chong) and Howard Brown about an
up-and-coming young Latino attorney who still lived at home. It was
called ``The Family Martinez.''
   CBS liked the idea of the lawyer, but wanted the show recast and
changed to a buddy show. It then became ``Amigos.''
   ``When they called me I said I wouldn't be in a show called
`Amigos,''' said Rodriguez. ``I felt I had already over-stereotyped
myself.''
   Rodriguez was born in Mexico and was raised in various parts of
this country as the son of migrant farm workers.
   ``As a kid I had a love-hate relationship with television,'' he
said. ``Television showed me the things I would never have, cars I
would never drive, places I would never see. My favorite show was
`Route 66.' Two single men driving a Corvette down the highway,
wind blowing in their hair and always a blonde around the bend.
Then I'd look around my neighborhood. I didn't see any Corvettes or
blondes.
   ``That worries me because now that I'm in TV I'll be a part of
the problem as some Latino boy sees me with nice clothes and the
right people.''
   Besides TV and his concert appearances, Rodriguez has been in
five movies, ``D.C. Cab,'' ``Quicksilver,'' ``Born in East L.A.,''
``Miracles'' and ``Whoopee Boys.''
   ``My favorite is `Quicksilver,' because it gave me a chance to
do some dramatic acting,'' he said.
   Rodriguez said he is constantly asked if the show will advance
the cause of Latinos.
   ``Come on,'' he said, ``this is just another sitcom. And I'm not
that altruistic. We're happy to be working. If a byproduct is that
we help other Latinos, I'm all for it. But that's not my goal. My
goal is to become financially secure so that my kids don't have to
harvest someone else's vegetables. Not that that's not an honorable
job, but let somebody else do it. I'm not the Latino Moses. I'm
just a standup comic. My job is to make people laugh.''

<HEAD>One Year After Leaving PTL, Bakker Dreams of New Evangelical
Empire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exiled television evangelist Jim Bakker is
dreaming of attracting a new flock to a Christian retreat in the
California desert, even as PTL, the ministry he left behind one
year ago Saturday, struggles to survive.
   PTL, under the control of a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Columbia,
continues to spend thousands of dollars a day more than it takes in.
   The ministry's television network is in the middle of a ``March
to Victory'' telethon with a goal of raising $4.2 million by April
1 to meet expenses, and PTL is considering the sale of hundreds of
undeveloped acres at the Heritage USA theme park to pay creditors.
   The woman Bakker admitted having sex with and paying money to
keep silent, Jessica Hahn, is living in the Playboy Mansion in Los
Angeles. She is writing more of her story for Playboy magazine,
spokesman Bill Farley said.
   The man Bakker originally accused of using blackmail to cause
his March 19 downfall at PTL, the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart, is dealing
with his own admitted sexual transgression that knocked him from
the pulpit.
   And the evangelist Bakker accused of stealing PTL, the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, is back preaching at his Old Time Gospel Hour in
Virginia.
   Falwell, who led PTL for six months, said it's been a dismal
year. ``It was obviously the toughest year evangelicals have ever
faced,'' he said. ``Credibility was gravely injured by the PTL
scandal.''
   The National Religious Broadcasters Association met in
Washington last month to set stricter standards of moral and
financial accountability.
   ``It is going to take me years to say all that I have learned
through this,'' Bakker told The Charlotte Observer recently. ``And
I'm going to be a different minister. I'm going to be less
judgmental.''
   Bakker calls his proposed new promised land Heritage Springs and
says it would be a 1,600-acre complex that would be similar to
Heritage USA outside Fort Mill, S.C. He says it would be located in
the California desert, but no specific plans have been made.
   The boyish-looking minister, newly ordained by a little-known
Oklahoma church, was used to preaching in a high-tech studio, his
sermons carried via satellite.
   The scene was very different last week when Bakker delivered his
first homily since heading west.
   For 30 minutes, he preached to elderly retirees at a trailer
park beside the Salton Sea in a desolate stretch of desert south of
Palm Springs, where he and his wife, Tammy, live.
   Tammy, who wept after introducing her husband to the
congregation in a tiny wooden chapel that doubles as a bingo hall,
said it has been a hard year for them.
   ``Some people will ask, `What have you learned in this last year
that you could share? The thing that I have learned the most is
that when everything is gone and what you worked 25 years to build
has crumbled to your feet, God doesn't change,'' Mrs. Bakker said.
   And what of the evangelical empire Bakker began building in 1978?
   The devout still travel to Fort Mill to vacation at the 500-acre
Heritage USA, with its hotel, water park and stables. The cable
television network still uses Bakker's upbeat formula of
entertainment mixed with preaching, prayer lines and pledges.
   But there are new faces and a new message: integrity and modesty.
   David Clark, a former Christian Broadcasting Network executive
who was appointed PTL trustee by bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds,
continually assures viewers the new guard isn't out for greed and
glory.
   ``The people here are living modestly and conservatively,'' he
said on the show recently. ``There are no seven-figure salaries
here and there are no celebrities. We're willing to be accountable
to you.''
   An Internal Revenue Service report filed in bankruptcy court
said the Bakkers and their top aides received $14.6 million in
excessive compensation from 1984 to 1987.
   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., is investigating Bakker
for possible tax, wire and mail fraud.
   Last week, Bakker fired his own salvo. He had a lawsuit filed in
York County against Roy Grutman, a New York attorney who used to
represent the ministry. Bakker is charging that Grutman tricked him
into resigning and turning the ministry over to Falwell.
   The Bakkers, who are seeking more than $10,000 in damages, claim
they did not know Grutman also represented Falwell at the time he
advised the Bakkers to step down.
   The suit says Grutman told the Bakkers that Swaggart was heading
a conspiracy to take over PTL.
   Grutman said the allegations were ``utterly meritless.''
   ``I think this is a publicity stunt by Bakker and his lawyers. I
was never retained by Mr. Bakker. I was not his lawyer,'' Grutman
said.

   In the year since Jim Bakker disclosed
his sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn, many former friends have
turned against her. She's angry and hurt, and she's planning to
retaliate _ in print.
   ``I'm not exactly the most loved person. There are a lot of
angry people. My mother never gave me a middle name and I finally
figured out why, because it's `controversy,''' said the 28-year-old
former church secretary.
   Much has happened to her in the year since her tryst with Bakker
became public, forcing him to resign the PTL ministry.
   She was paid $1 million by Playboy to tell her story. She
claimed Bakker had forcibly taken away her virginity, though he
said she appeared to be sexually experienced and was a willing
participant.
   Her appearance in the pages of America's leading men's magazine
was just the start of her relationship with the Playboy empire. She
moved into founder Hugh Hefner's Los Angeles mansion; she denied
she had become his lover.
   She recuperated at the mansion after having her breasts lifted
and her teeth and nose fixed. She bought a red Mercedes 560 SL
convertible.
   And she was forced to contend with a series of allegations that
she was not the innocent Bible belle that she claimed.
   One married man said he had slept with her before 1980 while two
others said they had had affairs with her. She said all three lied.
   Then, a Long Island woman claimed in a Penthouse story that Miss
Hahn had worked as a call girl for her. Finally, the son of Barbara
Bencivenga Pietropaolo, a neighbor, claimed he had been seduced by
Miss Hahn when he was 14.
   ``People have made a career out of my name. It's unbelievable,''
Miss Hahn said. ``It's mean what people are doing. It's really bad.
The madam story, c'mon. I never left my house. I'm the one girl who
didn't even go out nightclubbing.''
   But Ms. Pietropaolo, who a year ago helped shield Miss Hahn from
reporters, brought her messages and drove her on errands, is angry.
   ``She makes herself like a madonna. But I still say she's like
the anti-Christ,'' she said.
   Miss Hahn has ``forgotten all her friends,'' Ms. Pietropaolo
said. ``There were times she seemed so sweet and so nice.''
   Ms. Pietropaolo said her 12-year-old daughter, Tiffany, still
misses Miss Hahn. ``Tiffany was so close to her that she said, `If
I ever make it big you'll be dripping in furs and diamonds.' She
didn't even say goodbye.''
   Jessica Hahn is working on her own kind of farewell _ another
magazine story she says will explain why so many people who used to
be her friends have attacked her. She spends her days writing at
the Los Angeles mansion, where she has her own room and can stay
indefinitely.
   She occasionally goes shopping, jogs and takes trips to New
York, where photographers have caught her at publicity parties.
Recently, she said, she bumped into entertainer Liza Minnelli at a
Los Angeles restaurant. She was pleased to learn that Miss Minnelli
did not believe the attacks on Jessica Hahn.
   Still, Miss Hahn said she thinks ``this other story needs to be
told.''
   ``I have to defend myself,'' she said. ``I'm going to have the
last word, believe me.''

   U.S. industrial production edged up 0.2
percent in February as reductions in output at auto factories and
coal mines offset gains in other areas, the government reported.
   The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the February advance,
which followed a 0.3 percent January gain, was the poorest showing
since output declined by 0.2 percent in September.
   But private economists said the gains, even at a much slower
pace, represented good news for the economy.

   The housing industry, after staggering for two
months following the October stock market crash, enjoyed a sharp
8.9 percent increase in construction activity in February, the
biggest gain in more than a year, the government said.
   The Commerce Department said the increase boosted construction
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million units last
month following declines of 15.8 percent in December and 1.9
percent in January.
   Those setbacks raised concerns because housing is often the
first industry to weaken at the onset of a new recession.

according to a private survey.
   Twenty-one percent of the 398 corporations polled in the survey
published Wednesday said they anticipate expanding their production

   But only 19 percent of the companies surveyed by the Bureau of
National Affairs said they plan to increase their technical and

   Reports of unrest in Panama and Nicaragua set
off sharp fluctuations in crude oil prices, but near-term futures
contracts managed a moderate gain by the close of trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose
32 cents to settle at $16.00 per barrel on Wednesday.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
gasoline for April delivery rose 0.86 cent to 45.24 cents per
gallon and the April contract for wholesale heating oil gained 0.61
cent to close at 44.08 cents per gallon.
   The April price of crude jumped as high as $16.18 a barrel and
sank as low as $15.75 during the session amid reports of an
attempted coup in Panama and of a Nicaraguan attack on Contra
rebels in Honduras.
   Traders were concerned about a disruption in oil supplies
because of the vulnerability of an oil pipeline that runs through
Panama from the Atlantic to the Pacific, said Madison Galbraith,
senior energy specialist with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   As the reports crossed news wires, prices spurted upward,
Galbraith said. Prices later fell back as calm and sellers returned
to the trading floor.
   Galbraith attributed some of Wednesday's price fluctuations to
technical factors, including covering of short sales.
   In a short sale, a trader borrows a contract and sells it,
hoping to replace it later with another contract bought at a lower
price. A price rise can cause a flurry of buying as traders attempt
to cover their positions.

<HEAD>Koppers Studies Recapitalization Defense; Investors Await Numbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders are waiting for Koppers Co. to
say how much they could get under the company recapitalization plan
being considered as a defense against an unsolicited $45 per share
takeover bid from a British investor and the investment firm
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``That's what I'm waiting for,'' Robert Kanters of Legg Mason
Wood Walker Inc. of Pittsburgh said Wednesday. ``We really don't
know how much better the deal is until we get the particulars.''
   Koppers on Wednesday rejected as inadequate the $1.3 billion
tender offer from BNS Inc., a group led by Shearson and British
investor Brian Beazer, and said it was studying a recapitalization
as an alternative.
   The disclosures came as Shearson faced increasing state and
local government pressure over its unusual role in the takeover bid.
   Koppers stock dipped 87{ cents to $53.62{ a share Wednesday in
heavy New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Koppers said its recapitalization _ which analysts have
speculated could pay cash and securities worth $55 to $60 a share _
would include a substantial cash dividend to holders of Koppers'
nearly 28 million common shares, plus stock in the recapitalized
company.
   Recapitalization _ essentially making a major adjustment in a
company's relative levels of debt and equity _ has been used often
in recent years as a takeover defense. A recapitalizing company
generally must make huge borrowings to finance the special dividend
to shareholders, making a takeover much more expensive.
   Charles R. Pullin, Koppers' chairman, said the company also
would explore the public sale of all or a part of its construction
materials business _ one of its two business lines _ to help boost
the special dividend. It also would consider the sale of its common
stock to a new employee stock ownership plan.
   A Koppers spokesman said the board of directors set no timetable
for settling details of any recapitalization plan.
   Beazer quickly criticized Koppers' announcement, and claimed
that if Koppers explored a recapitalization the company was
obligated to give confidential corporate information to BNS.
   Beazer said that based on recent court decisions in similar
recapitalizations, Kopper essentially would be bidding for itself.
Koppers therefore was obligated to give BNS access to the same
confidential corporate data Koppers _ or any other bidder _ would
get for formulating the plan.
   Shearson, which holds a 46 percent share in BNS, came under
further fire from city and state lawmakers.
   Shearson's equity participation is an aggressive variation of
investment bankers' traditional role as adviser and financier in
hostile takeovers.
   The city of Pittsburgh filed a federal suit claiming that
Shearson _ an underwriter of city bonds _ by joining with Beazer
had violated its duty not to hurt the Pittsburgh economy.
   Under Beazer's plan to sell Koppers' chemical business, about
1,100 jobs could disappear in Pittsburgh, city officials contend.
   Separately, Mayor Richard Caliguiri ordered department heads to
exclude Shearson from consideration as an underwriter of future
financing, said spokesman David Welty.
   In addition, Pennsylvania Treasurer G. Davis Greene Jr.
suspended his department's dealings with Shearson. The state
purchased $565 million in commercial notes and bonds from the firm
in the past six months, according to Greene.
   Separately, Pennsylvania's State Employees Retirement System
approved a resolution expressing concern over the takeover attempt.
The system holds 544,650 shares of American Express, Shearson's
parent, and 17,900 shares of Koppers.
   Some analysts speculated Koppers soon would join the negative
publicity campaign against Shearson.
   ``I would expect the first thing you'll see...will be some
newspaper advertising that'll peel the hide off Shearson,'' said
Donald A. Pattison of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. of New York.
   Koppers alleged in a federal lawsuit filed March 11 that
Shearson violated disclosure requirements of securities laws and
that it offered to sell Koppers its services defending the company
against hostile takeovers after laying plans with Beazer to raid
the company.

the merger of the two drug makers, which includes creation of a
$2.475 billion Dalkon Shield trust fund to compensate victims.
   Before approving the deal Merhige had to be satisfied that some
claims would be paid before final approval of Robins' bankruptcy
reorganization plan. Robins has been under Chapter 11 protection
from creditors since August 1985.
   The judge approved the Jan. 19 merger agreement only after
Robins offered to provide $100 million to cover administrative
start-up costs for the trust fund and to begin sending payments to
some of the victims.
   Merhige said he was concerned about a provision in the merger
agreement that allowed American Home to pull out of the deal if
appeals of the final reorganization plan remained pending a year
after the plan was confirmed by the court.
   The judge suggested American Home put up $100 million to cover
the start-up costs, and said he would not approve the merger
agreement without it.
   Later in the day, Robins offered to provide the $100 million and
the judge agreed to the merger deal. Roscoe E. Puckett Jr., a
Robins spokesman, said the first payments will involve smaller
amounts for women who claimed lesser use and injuries from the
Dalkon Shield.
   Any payments still are at least several months away. Court
approval of the merger is only one step in the reorganization of
Robins, a Richmond-based pharmaceutical manufacturer.
   The company's final reorganization plan also requires approval
by Robins' stockholders and creditors, including the Dalkon Shield
claimants.
   The merger with American Home involves an exchange of $700
million of American Home common stock and full payment to Robins'
trade creditors, in addition to the provision of the Dalkon Shield
trust fund.
   Merhige said he would conduct a hearing later to review a filing
by the Rorer Group Inc., which had sought to acquire Robins, for a
$25 million breakup fee stemming from a previous merger agreement
between Robins and Fort Washington, Pa.-based Rorer.
   After Merhige set the $2.475 billion figure for Dalkon Shield
claims late last year, Robins had three corporate suitors. Robins
rejected the Rorer deal and a similar proposal from France's Sanofi
SA in favor of American Home, which offered a substantially quicker
settlement of Dalkon Shield claims.

   Texaco Inc. says it will turn over
information sought by several small shareholders who have objected
to the company's bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   The company's largest shareholder, financier Carl Icahn, also
has objected to provisions of the plan that would release officers
of Texaco, Getty Oil Co. and various Getty trusts from any
liability in Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil.
   A Texas jury decided in 1985 that Texaco had wrongly interfered
with Pennzoil Co.'s agreement to merge with Getty and awarded
Pennzoil $10.53 billion in damages.
   Texaco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy code a year ago to avoid having to post a
potentially ruinous bond to appeal the decision.
   As part of its plan for emerging from Chapter 11, Texaco would
pay Pennzoil $3 billion cash to settle their case.
   The documents sought by the small shareholders covered
discussions on why the reorganization plan would release the
Texaco, Getty and trust officials from liability.
   The 16 shareholders had filed suit against those parties to seek
reimbursement of the settlement costs from them, and the
reorganization plan would cause those suits to be dismissed.
   Daniel Krasner, a lawyer for one of the shareholders, said the
attorneys for the shareholders would study the documents and decide
by Monday whether to continue opposing the plan.
   Texaco shareholders are voting on the reorganization proposal
and a bankruptcy court hearing is scheduled for next week to hear
the results of the vote as well as arguments on whether the judge
should confirm the plan.
   In papers filed with Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg,
Icahn, who controls about 14.8 percent of Texaco's shares, said he
would vote for the reorganization proposal but urged the judge to
drop the liability release.
   ``The releases are a purely gratuitous act and an unconscionable
act of self-dealing by Texaco's directors,'' he said.

<HEAD>Business Outlook Remains Strong for Second Quarter, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continued uncertainty in the financial markets
has not greatly undermined U.S. business executives' expectations
for second quarter sales and profits, according to a survey
published today by Dun & Bradstreet Corp.
   The business research company polled 1,500 executives nationwide
between Feb. 9 and Feb. 23 for its latest quarterly business
expectations survey.
   Based on the survey, Dun & Bradstreet's sales optimism index for
the second quarter remained strong at 69, down only slightly from
70 in the first three months of the year.
   The executives' outlook for higher profits in the coming quarter
improved modestly, with the profit expectations index rising to 64
from 63 in the first quarter.
   ``Expectations for higher sales and profits are still at the
highest levels since 1984, when the current business expansion was
at its peak,'' said Joseph W. Duncan, corporate economist and chief
statistician for Dun & Bradstreet. ``Business people remain
confident in the future, despite lingering uncertainty in the
financial markets.''
   Expectations for higher prices remained stable at an index of
41, unchanged from the first quarter.
   Results by industry sector differed widely. Among executives
from manufacturing companies, the price expectation index fell to
38 from 40 in the first quarter, while the index for retailing
companies moved up to 42 from 36.
   Expectations for increased business inventories were higher,
with the index rising to 28 from 23, with most of the gain
anticipated in the manufacturing sector. The employment
expectations index fell to 23 from 26, mainly because of
anticipated declines in retailing and wholesaling, while the index
for new orders rose to 69 from 67.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankruptcies, bank failures and a criminal
investigation of Texas' savings and loan industry continue to bash
the state's financial image as the nation's biggest and the best,
and analysts say the worst isn't over.
   Banking analyst Herb Jones of the investment firm Eppler, Guerin
& Turner says Texans used to brag that everything in the state was
bigger, better, the best.
   ``We can't say that now. We look at the Northeast and see their
growth is far superior to ours. That was never supposed to
happen,'' Jones said Wednesday.
   As the state's largest bank-holding company seeks federal
rescue, the nation's perception of Texas has become more negative,
analysts say.
   Dallas-based First RepublicBank Corp., with $33.2 billion in
deposits and 134 banking facilities statewide, acknowledged Tuesday
it was seeking federal help because of a deteriorating loan
portfolio and difficulty in raising deposits.
   Gerald W. Fronterhouse, chairman and chief executive officer,
said a loss of $1 billion in deposits since the beginning of
February contributed to the bank's decision.
   There are signs the state's battered economy is rebounding and
that the energy industry is revitalizing, but analysts say the
banking industry still lags, coping with mistakes made one to three
years ago and the continuing troubles in real estate.
   ``Real estate is still a real thorn here,'' Jones said. ``I
expect some further weakness in the real estate sector.''
   Also hurting the state's image are the bankruptcy court
petitions of such Texas notables as former Gov. John Connally, who
was U.S. Treasury Secretary under President Nixon; Connally's
lieutenant governor, Ben Barnes; oil heir Cullen Davis of Fort
Worth; famed heart surgeon Denton Cooley; some businesses of the
billionaire Hunt brothers; former Dallas Cowboys owner Clint
Murchison; and the Western Co. of North America, owned by Texas
Rangers owner Eddie Chiles.
   The number of Texas bank failures, meanwhile, continues soaring,
nearly doubling from 26 in 1986 to 50 in 1987, and stands at 15 so
far this year.
   ``We do have some other banks that are in trouble. I have no
reason to think we've hit the bottom of the problem. There could
still be some more (banks) to be heard from,'' Jones said.
   Staggering losses continue at other banks _ with the state's
seven largest bank-holding companies losing a combined $2.6 billion
last year. By contrast, all Texas banks lost $883.2 million in 1986.
   Regulators also say more than one-third of the state's 281
savings and loan institutions are insolvent. The FBI and the U.S.
Justice Department are in the midst of a criminal investigation of
some of the state's thrifts, called the largest white-collar probe
in the Southwest's history.
   Tuesday, Houston-based First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc.
extended its deadline for debt holders to redeem their securities
at a discount under a rescue plan representing the second-largest
bank bailout in U.S. history.
   Jones said he believes a major financial institution will come
into Texas and take over First RepublicBank, if the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. makes it an attractive deal.
   ``It's a very desirable institution, at a price,'' Jones said.
``A lot of worms are in there still. Will the FDIC pick them up?
That's the question. I think they will. They're going to have to.''
   First RepublicBank's plea for federal aid is a ``bittersweet
story,'' said Alan Coleman, director of the Southwestern Graduate
School of Banking at Southern Methodist University.
   The good news is that new capital will be brought into the
state, along with new faces and new investors. But the bad news, he
said, is that ``it's very tough on the people struggling with the
problems here.''

<HEAD>Judge Denies Motion Pirelli Sought In Firestone Takeover Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOROTHY GAST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. has gained a court
victory in its attempt to thwart a takeover by Italian tiremaker
Pirelli, with a federal judge's refusal to block Ohio's
anti-takeover law as unconstitutional.
   U.S. District Judge Alice M. Batchelder ruled Wednesday that the
Ohio Control Share Acquisition Act does not violate federal law by
discriminating against interstate commerce, or causing inconsistent
state regulation.
   Pirelli Societe Generale SA had sought a preliminary injunction
against the law in attempting to press an unsolicited $58 a share,
or $1.9 billion, takeover bid for Firestone, which has its North
American tire headquarters in Akron.
   Firestone stock closed at $63.12{ a share Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange, unchanged from Tuesday's close.
   The Ohio statute requires a hostile bidder to wait up to 50 days
for shareholders to vote before it may purchase tendered shares.
Federal law requires that any tender offer remain open for no less
than 20 business days.
   Judge Batchelder said it was possible for companies to comply
with both Ohio and federal law.
   ``The Ohio act... by allowing the shareholders collectively to
evaluate the fairness of the tender offer and to vote as a group,
...furthers the policy of investor protection,'' Ms. Batchelder
wrote in a 14-page opinion.
   The Ohio statute does not discriminate against interstate
commerce or cause inconsistent state regulation because it has the
same effects on bidders from inside and outside of Ohio, she stated.
   Pirelli's $1.9 billion offer is contingent on Firestone dropping
its plans to sell 75 percent of its tire business to Bridgestone
Corp. of Japan.
   Firestone officials said Pirelli's offer effectively killed
earlier plans to sell most of the Firestone tire-making business to
Bridgestone, but it again was talking with Bridgestone about other
options.
   The U.S. tire maker said it would advise shareholders by Friday
on the Pirelli offer.

<HEAD>Henley to Restructure, Buy Back 22 Pct of Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henley Group Inc., a two-year-old
holding company, says it plans to split into two public companies
and buy back 22 percent of its stock.
   The stock buy-back announced Wednesday would cost about $512
million at current prices.
   Henley jumped $1.75 a share to close at $25.625 a share in
over-the-counter trading.
   Henley is an amalgam of 35 construction, environmental, energy,
chemcial, manufacturing and finance businesses spun off in April
1986 by Allied-Signal Inc., which itself was formed by a $5 billion
merger in 1985.
   Henley has gained a reputation for tightening operations to
boost profits in individual units and then taking those units
public. The current market value of Henley's investments in its
subsidiaries that have publicly traded shares and its other
long-term investment securities is $2 billion.
   In recent months Henley has been involved in a so-far
unsuccessful bid for Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the
Chicago-based railroad, land and natural resources giant.
   Under the restructuring, which was approved in principle by the
company's board on Wednesday, Henley's assets would be divided
between two public companies:
   _Wheelabrator Group Inc., which already is publicly traded,
would take over Henley's stake in its successful Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc. subsidiary and other assets related to the
refuse-to-energy business.
   Wheelabrator Group would have the flexibility and resources to
speed up the expansion of its businesses through mergers,
acquisitions and joint ventures.
   _A newly created entity, to be called Henley Group Inc., would
own Signal Capital Corp., Signal Landmark Holdings Inc., Henley
Manufacturing Corp. and Henley's stake in Fisher Scientific Group
Inc., plus other assets.
   ``This program will enable our shareholders to participate
directly in Henley's $650 million investment in Wheelabrator
Technologies, the nation's leading refuse-to-energy business,''
said Michael Dingman, Henley's chairman and chief executive.
   Shares of the new entity that will be created for Henley's other
holdings will be distributed to stockholders as a partially taxable
special dividend, the company said.
   Henley's board also authorized the repurchase of 20 million of
the company's 90 million outstanding shares. The number of
outstanding shares peaked at 129 million in November 1986 before
the company initiated a series of stock buy-backs.
   After the buy-back is completed, Henley will have repurchased
nearly 43 percent of its stock.
   Separately, Henley said it decided to waive protection under a
recently enacted Delaware statute providing that a holder of 15
percent of a company's stock is prohibited from merging with the
company or undertaking certain other actions for three years.
   ``We do not believe it is in the best interests of shareholders
to impose these restrictions,'' Dingman said. ``We prefer to give
investors a free hand to make those decisions.''
   Henley's top management owns about 6.5 million of the company's
shares. That stake would rise to 9.3 percent with the completion of
the stock repurchase.
   Henley spokesman Norman Ritter said management wasn't
considering a bid to take the company private.
   Henley also said it intends to raise $1 billion by issuing
notes, then using the proceeds to pay off its current $980 million
in bank debt. That will allow the company to arrange $2.5 billion
in new bank credit, Henley said.

<HEAD>Sears Acquisition Of Western Auto Signals Move To Specialty Stores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. has agreed to buy Western
Auto Supply Co. in a $402 million deal that some industry watchers
call the biggest step Sears has taken to increase its specialty
retailing operations.
   Sears, the nation's largest general retailer, announced
Wednesday it would pay $19 a share to acquire 52.3 percent of
Western Auto's 13 million outstanding shares that are held by
company management and the investment firm Wesray Capital Corp.
   If Western Auto's board of directors approves the merger, Sears
would acquire the remaining shares at the same price. Sears said it
reserved the right to cancel the deal if the Western Auto board of
directors fails to give its approval to the tender offer by Friday.
   The stock buyout totals $250 million, and Sears also would
assume $152 million in debt held by the auto supply company.
   ``This is the first really significant step Sears has made into
specialty retailing,'' said John Landschultz, an analyst with
Mesirow & Co. in Chicago.
   Sears previously had acquired other specialty operations,
including its Eye Care Centers of America, Pinstripe Petites, its
paint and hardware store and Sears Business Systems stores.
   Sears Chairman Edward A. Brennan called the acquisition ``an
important part of Sears' previously announced plan to expand its
presence in specialty retailing.''
   Brennan said Western Auto is ``an ideal complement to Sears
Merchandise Group, which for decades has been one of the nation's
leading retailers of automotive parts and services.''
   Western Auto share jumped $6 to $18.50 a share in national
over-the-counter stock trading. Sears rose 12{ cents to $37.87{ on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Western Auto will continue to operate under its name and
management, Sears said.
   The Kansas City-based company sells auto supplies, tires,
appliances and lawn and garden equipment through 278 retail stores
it owns and through 1,570 independently owned Western Auto outlets,
which buy the products wholesale.
   Sears said John T. Lundegard, Western Auto's chairman and chief
executive officer, would remain as head of the auto supply unit and
would report to Alfred G. Goldstein, president of Sears' specialty
merchandising.
   Last year, Western Auto had a profit of $10.5 million on sales
of $930.8 million.
   Sears earned $1.65 billion and had revenue of $48.4 billion last
year, including sales of about $2 billion in automotive parts and
services.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's main stock market barometer climbed today
to a level higher than just before the October crash, while the
dollar fell slightly in lackluster trading, traders said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
25,872.29, up 167.86 points, or 0.65 percent. On Oct. 19, the index
closed at 25,746.56, before plunging by 3,836.48 points the
following day.
   ``Individual investors played a big role in the strong market
activity,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It is the first time the
index has gone beyond the level recorded just prior to the Oct. 20
crash.''
   He said last minute transactions by many local businesses in
preparation for the fiscal year beginning April 1 also contributed
to the market's bullish performance.
   Today was the third consecutive trading day that the index
climbed. The Nikkei posted a 228.76-point, or 0.90 percent, gain
Wednesday.
   ``Investors are bullish for high prices lying ahead, and the
market will have to find some negative factors about the Japanese
economy before investors are going to back off,'' said Masahiro
Umemori, a stock analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage firm.
   Meanwhile, on the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar
closed at 127.43 yen, down 0.06 yen from Wednesday's close of
127.49 yen.
   The currency traded in a narrow range between 127.40 yen and
127.71 yen as market participants waited for the release later
today of U.S. trade figures for January.
   The dollar has been pressured lower in the past by U.S. trade
reports showing a growing imbalance of imports over exports. But as
recent reports have shown improvements in the trade gap, the U.S.
currency has stabilized.
   ``Basically, the foreign exchange market is real quiet,'' said a
trader from a major investment firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   There was no ``real action,'' he added.
   The United States posted a $12.1 billion deficit in December.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were lower at midday Thursday, but
well above their worst levels, helped by a cut in bank base lending
rates.
   Trading was subdued, however, amid nervousness ahead of the
release of U.S. trade data for January.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 6.2
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,819.5 at midday.
   Volume was a light 277.4 million shares at midday, compared with
314.1 million shares at the same time Wednesday.
   Britain's major commercial banks cut their base lending rate by
half a percentage point to 8.5 percent after the Bank of England
signaled that it wanted such a cut by cutting its own money market
intervention rates.
   The cuts took the market by surprise and triggered a wave of
buying, lifting share prices from their lowest levels, dealers said.
   The rate cut came as the pound moved above 3.10 West German
marks and seemed to confirm a new unofficial government cap for the
pound at that level, which was seen as a positive development,
dealers said.
   But some dealers said the rate cut also raised worries about
overheating in the economy.
   ``The market is very vulnerable to bad news at the moment,'' a
dealer said.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is planning to
pump about $1 billion of capital into First RepublicBank Corp. to
offset a two-day drain of deposits, according to a report published
today.
   The Dallas Morning News quoted unidentified banking sources as
saying the run on funds would force the FDIC to transfer about $1
billion in interim assistance, perhaps as early as today.
   Sources also said such interim assistance is likely to include a
blanket guarantee of all deposits by the FDIC.
   ``Without a blanket guarantee from the FDIC, the deposits are
going to leave,'' a banking analyst who asked to remain
unidentified told the newspaper. ``You have to stabilize the
patient before you can do the surgery.''
   Officials of the bank and the FDIC declined comment late
Wednesday on the report.
   Meanwhile, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen estimated it could cost up
to $5 billion to prop up First RepublicBank, but he says federal
regulators were prepared to help the bank holding company avoid a
financial collapse.
   Bentsen said Wednesday he spoke with Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, Robert L. Clarke, the comptroller of the currency,
and L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC.
   ``I've been assured that all of those financial institutions are
standing by to help,'' Bentsen said. ``They're going to do all they
can to see that this situation is stabilized.''
   Bentsen said the Senate Banking Committee gave him the $5
billion figure, but he also said he did not believe there were any
definitive figures yet on the cost of a rescue plan.
   First RepublicBank, the state's biggest banking company,
acknowledged Tuesday it had been forced to seek federal aid because
of a deteriorating loan portfolio and difficulty in raising
deposits.
   A First RepublicBank spokesman said Wednesday the bank
experienced a runoff of deposits on Tuesday, but that the situation
apparently had stabilized. An earlier drain of deposits and
customer defections had forced it to begin preliminary discussions
with the FDIC, the spokesman said.
   ``Tuesday there was a significant amount of activity, and there
were some deposit outflows,'' the spokesman said. ``But there were
no lines or confusion in our branches or banks.''
   The spokesman did not quantify the size of the deposit outflows.
   The FDIC is prepared to assist with capital and the Federal
Reserve with liquidity, Bentsen said.
   ``Each of these regulatory powers have assured me they will do
everything they can that is necessary to keep that situation from
unraveling,'' he said.
   Bentsen said the agencies would ensure First RepublicBank
branches statewide remained open, but would not comment on the
status of the holding company.

   The nation's trade deficit widened slightly in January to $12.4
billion after two months of sharp improvements, the Commerce
Department said today in a report that left financial markets
uncertain.
   The dollar and the bond market rallied after the report, but
gave back most of their gains after a few minutes.
   The excess of imports over exports was up from the $12.2 billion
deficit in December.
   Exports, which had propelled improvement in November and
December, fell by 10 percent in January to $22.3 billion.
   Analysts had expected a deterioration of the trade balance in
January, noting that exports are traditionally down in that month.
   However, imports also fell in January, by 6 percent to $34.8
billion.
   Thus, the deficit for the month _ eagerly followed by financial
markets _ was somewhat better than most analysts had expected.
   Within half an hour of the report's 8:30 a.m. EST release, the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was yielding 8.58 percent, little
changed from 8.60 percent late Wednesday. And the dollar was barely
higher against the Japanese yen, British pound and West German mark.
   On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said industrial production
edged up 0.2 percent in February despite output reductions at auto
factories and coal mines.
   Economists said the gain, although slower than the January rise,
represented good news for the economy and further dampened concerns
about a severe slowdown in the aftermath of the October stock
market crash.
   A more positive signal came from the Commerce Department, which
said the housing industry after staggering for two months enjoyed
an 8.9 percent gain in construction activity in February, the
biggest rise in more than a year.
   ``With interest rates at low levels and the economy growing and
no recession in sight, we think we have all the ingredients in
place to generate a strong spring building season,'' said Warren
Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Nevertheless, the news hurt the bond market, a barometer of
interest rates and the economy. Stronger growth implies future
inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments.
   The Treasury's key 30-year issue fell $10 per $1,000 in face
amount. Its yield jumped from 8.51 percent to 8.60 percent, its
highest level since late January.
   But the stock market closed largely higher. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks, which most of the day showed a
modest loss, ended with a 16.91 point gain at 2,064.32 in slow
trading.

   The dollar was mixed against major foreign
currencies in European trading following today's release of U.S.
trade figures for January.
   Gold prices fell.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported that the merchandise trade
deficit widened slightly to $12.4 billion in January from $12.2
billion in December.
   The increase followed two consecutive months of sharp
improvements.
   The market had expected the deficit to widen to $12.8 billion.
   In trading before the report, the dollar was bolstered by
Wednesday's announcement that the Reagan administration is sending
3,200 soldiers to Honduras in response to an alleged Nicaraguan
incursion in pursuit of U.S.-backed Contra rebels based in Honduras.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8520 after the
trade report, compared to $1.8505 late Wednesday.
   The dollar rose to 127.85 Japanese yen in London after the
report. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar dipped to a closing 127.43 yen
from 127.49 yen at Wednesday's close.
   Other dollar rates in Europe in afternoon trading, compared with
late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6765 West German marks, up
from 1.6690; 1.3870 Swiss francs, up from 1.3810; 5.7025 French
francs, up from 5.6782; 1.8845 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8750;
1,243.50 Italian lire, up from 1,238.45; and 1.2493 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2518.
   The dollar was also higher in New York trading following the
Commerce Department's announcement.
   London's major bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $445.35 a troy ounce, down from $446.20 late
Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $445.25, down from $447.00 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, the metal had closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $448.75,
up from $447.79.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid of $6.31 a troy ounce,
down from $6.36 late Wednesday.

   Stock prices rose in active trading early today,
reflecting an initially favorable investor response to the
government's report of a lower-than-expected January trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.98 points to
2,068.30 by 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 618 up, 390 down and 464
unchanged. Volume on the Big Board came to 27.18 million shares
after the first half hour.
   Although the trade deficit widened slightly in January to $12.4
billion from $12.2 billion in December, market economists had
expected an even greater gap. The news therefore provided an
optimistic tone to stock trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.17 to 151.45. The American Stock Exchange's market value index
rose 0.29 to 297.80.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.91 to
2,064.32.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 945 up, 540 down and 481 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 153.59 million shares, against 133.17 million in the

   Stock prices rose this morning, buoyed by
corporate takeover maneuvering and favorable investor response to
the government's report of a lower-than-expected January trade
deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials advanced 14.76 points to
2,079.08 by 11 a.m. EST. Broader market barometers also rose.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by nearly 2-to-1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 843 up, 442 down and 502 unchanged.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 81.56 million shares after 90
minutes.
   Although the trade deficit reported by the Commerce Department
widened slightly in January to $12.4 billion from $12.2 billion in
December, market economists had expected an even greater gap of
about $13 billion.
   The news therefore provided an optimistic tone to stock trading
and substantiated other evidence that the economy is growing
despite fears of a slowdown raised by the October crash.
   ``I think the trade number was just what everybody liked,'' said
Philip C. Puccio, manager of institutional trading at Dillon, Read
& Co. in New York. ``It brought a sigh of relief.''
   Nevertheless, Puccio and other trading strategists said
investors still were reluctant to commit large amounts of cash to
the stock market until the conclusion of so-called ``triple
witching hour'' on Friday.
   That quarterly event is so-named because of the
near-simultaneous expiration of contracts to buy or sell
stock-index futures, stock options and futures. It has played a
role in wild price swings in the past.
   Chemical, forest-product and drug companies all did well,
reflecting optimism that their export businesses will continue to
improve. Dow rose 1 to 87], International Paper rose | to 44| and
Lilly rose 2 to 84.
   Takeover related buying also played a role in lifting stocks
today. Rumors of impending acquisition attempts on Pillsbury,
Philips Petroleum and U.S. Shoe sent those stocks sharply higher in
active trading. Pillsbury rose 2\ to 44\; Phillips rose } to 17 and
U.S. Shoe rose 2 to 24{.
   American Standard rose 1[ to 76| after investment firm Kelso &
Co. agreed to buy the company for $78 a share, topping a hostile
$73 a share offer from Black & Decker Corp.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.77 to 152.05. The American Stock Exchange's market value index
rose 0.67 to 298.18.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.91 to

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, then began trending a
little higher.
   Traders said the support for soybeans came from aggressive
commodity fund buying.
   And those improving prices gave a lift to corn futures, which
had been under light pressure from commercial and speculative
selling, according to Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Trading was very light in the wheat pit, but that grain received
some help from the belief that it had been oversold.
   In early dealings, wheat was 1{ cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.03 a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to 1 cent higher with March at $1.98 a bushel; oats were \
cent lower to 2{ cents higher with March at $1.90} a bushel; and
soybeans were 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with March at $6.13{ a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .22 cent lower to .08 cent higher with April at
73.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .38 cent lower
with March at 82.02 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent lower to
.20 cent higher with April at 44.75 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to .23 cent higher with March at 52.50 cents
a pound.
   On Wednesday, live cattle futures were mostly higher but other
livestock and meat futures declined.

<TEXT>
   The factory operating rate remained unchanged
in February for the third consecutive month as cutbacks in auto
production and coal mining held back gains in other areas, the
government reported today.
   The Federal Reserve said that America's factories, mines and
utilities operated at 82.4 percent of capacity, the highest
operating rate in more than eight years.
   While the February rate was unchanged, the government revised
upward the operating rates for December and January. A month ago,
the government had put the operating rate in those months at 82.2
percent.
   Analysts said the fact that the overall rate has been frozen for
three months was consistent with their view that production slowed
in the early part of 1988. Businesses were cutting back on orders
in an effort to reduce a backlog of unsold goods which piled up
during the final three months of 1988.
   The backlog was particularly high in the auto area where auto
makers have had to resume incentive programs to spur sales.
   In February, the operating rate at manufaturing plants remained
unchanged at 82.5 percent of capacity. This reflected an operating
rate of 80.1 percent at plants making durable goods, unchanged from
January, and a rate of 85.9 percent at factories making nondurable
goods, down 0.2 percentage point from the January rate.
   Auto plants operated at 77 percent of capacity in February, down
from 77.4 percent in January and a full 5 percentage points below
the operating rate in October.
   The mining industry operated at 80.6 percent of capacity in
February, down from 81.1 percent in January. The decline was
attributed to a drop in production at coal mines.
   U.S. utilities operated at 82.2 percent of capacity last month,
up from 81.7 percent in January.
   The overall operating rate of 82.4 percent was more than two
percentage points higher than the 79.7 percent operating rate in
February 1987. It was the highest level since March 1980, when
production hit 83.7 percent of capacity.

<TEXT>
   JB's Restaurants Inc. says it will
withdraw from the Big Boy franchise system and operate its 110
restaurants in 10 western states independently.
   JB's Chairman Clark Jones said the decision came after careful
evaluation of the company's relationship with Big Boy franchisor,
Elias Brothers Restaurants Inc.
   ``During our 27 years in business, we have internally developed
the systems and organization necessary to operate as an independent
regional restaurant chain,'' he said. ``We believe that we can best
maximize our shareholders' interests by eliminating the territorial
restrictions and franchise fees required under our current
franchise agreement.''
   The Salt Lake City based JB's operates restaurants in Utah,
Idaho, Montana, Washington, Wyoming, Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico,
South Dakota and Hawaii, the company said Thursday.
   Jones said the company does not expect to have significant costs
in connection with the withdrawal.
   ``Under the agreement, we have an option to withdraw from the
system without cost, and we had already planned to repaint all of
our buildings and change all of our signs in connection with the
re-imaging of our concept,'' Jones said.
   ``However, we will take a one time non-cash charge during the
third quarter of approximately $1.5 million for the write-off of
related intangible territorial franchise rights,'' he added.
   Jones said elimination of franchise fees will allow the company
to recover the write-off over a two-year period.
   Under the terms of its agreement, JB's has six months to change
its signs and eliminate the references to Big Boy from its menus.
   Clark said most of the changes will occur during the second half
of the six-month period because the company has the option to
re-enter the system before June 15, 1988.

   The Canadian dollar traded above 80 U.S. cents
today for the first time in four years.
   Buoyed by Wednesday's report of an increase in Canada's foreign
trade surplus, the Canadian currency was quoted as high as 80.08
U.S. cents in mid-morning trading on foreign exchange markets.
   The Canadian dollar last traded above 80 U.S. cents on Feb. 24,
1984. It is now more than 10 cents above its all-time low of 69.13
U.S. cents recorded in February 1986.
   The currency, which ended 1987 at 76.93 U.S. cents, has risen
steadily this year.
   The trend is good news for Canadians who buy goods imported from
the United States and who travel south of the border. But it is bad
news for Canadian manufacturers, who send 80 percent of their
exports to the United States.

   Allowing private companies to go into the mail
delivery business could improve service, but such a drastic change
must be phased in gradually, the President's Commission on
Privatization says.
   Over time, the government monopoly on delivering letters should
be ended, with immediate steps to allow private firms to deliver
advertising and to operate in rural areas, the commission
recommends.
   The mail recommendations are part of a detailed report on
privatizing various government operations, scheduled to be released
Friday at the White House.
   Other aspects of the study include developing a system of
private air traffic control towers; issuing vouchers for low-income
housing instead of building public housing units; selling the
government's $250 billion loan portfolio; and issuing vouchers for
public school education.
   In general, the study reports, the benefits of switching to a
competitive mail delivery system would outweigh the problems,
although the changeover could be confusing and costly.
   The overall costs of postal service should be reduced through
competition, the commission concluded, and efficiency could be
improved. The report noted that the growth of competition in parcel
delivery has provided consumer with more alternatives and price
competition.
   Officials of the U.S. Postal Service said Thursday they could
not comment on the report until they have had a chance to study it.
   However, major unions representing postal workers already have
fired a volley at the study based on preliminary reports of what it
would contain.
   If mail delivery is opened to competition, private companies
will skim off the money-making city delivery routes and leave the
more expensive rural deliveries to the Postal Service, the National
Association of Letter Carriers contended. The American Postal
Workers Union also has opposed privatization plans.
   Such a change would destroy the nation's system of universal
service, the letter carrier's union charged, ``rural and inner-city
residents would not be served by private firms and-or would receive
reduced service at exorbitant postage rates.''
   Former Postmaster General Preston R. Tisch last fall termed the
idea of privatization a ``dubious'' solution, contending that the
changeover would be ``chaotic and impractical.''
   The conservative Heritage Foundation, however, has lent its
support to at least limited privatization, calling for rule changes
to allow private firms to deliver third-class advertising mail and
for increased contracting out of postal services.
   The recommendations of the privatization commission are more
sweeping, however, if tempered with the caution that the changeover
could be confusing, as was the switch from a telephone monopoly to
a system of competing systems.
   Changing to a private system could cause problems for many of
the Postal Services' 800,000 workers, and tax money could be
required to assist in finding new jobs and in retraining, the study
indicates.
   In addition, the change could result in varying postage rates
according to which company a mailer used, perhaps including
differing rates depending on distance traveled.
   Questions also arise about liability for lost mail and the
process of notifying a variety of companies about changes of
address, the study noted.
   Even so, it contends, the long-run benefits should outweigh the
problems associated with a change.
   The recommendation comes at a trying time for the Postal
Service, caught in a public relations bind between congressional
budget cutting which has forced it to reduce window hours and
collections at the same time rates are being raised.
   Here is a rundown of the basic postal service recommendations of
the commission:
   _Open mail delivery to competition, but on a gradual basis with
compensation for postal workers and managers for loss of benefits
and earnings.
   _Consider turning the Postal Service itself into a private
business, perhaps by selling stock in the agency to its employees.
   _Immediately end restrictions on private firms delivering
third-class advertising, widely known as ``junk'' mail.
   _Immediately open up rural delivery to competition.
   _End restrictions on private firms placing mail in letter boxes
at people's homes.
   _Ease restrictions on delivery of express mail.
   _Actively pursue all possibilities for contracting out services.

   The U.S. dollar rose against all major foreign
currencies except the Canadian dollar in European trading Thursday
following the release of better-than-expected U.S. trade figures.
Gold prices fell.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported that the merchandise trade
deficit widened slightly to $12.4 billion in January from $12.2
billion in December. Many traders had expected a trade deficit in
the range of $12.8 billion.
   ``The market was very nervous immediately after the release (of
the trade figures) because the dollar didn't immediately shoot
up,'' said a foreign currency dealer in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   ``But gradually the dollar started moving up and that built up
some momentum.''
   In Tokyo, before the trade figures were announced, the dollar
dipped to a closing 127.43 yen from 127.49 yen at Wednesday's
close. In later London trading, it was quoted at 128.15 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained more than one cent against the
British pound. One pound cost $1.8385 in London late Thursday, down
from $1.8505 late Wednesday.
   The pound began falling Thursday morning after major banks cut
their base lending rates to 8.5 percent from 9 percent.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6775 West German marks, up from
1.6690; 1.3940 Swiss francs, up from 1.3810; 5.7175 French francs,
up from 5.6782; 1.8885 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8750; 1,244.37
Italian lire, up from 1,238.45; and 1.2493 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2518.
   Gold prices eased in sluggish European trading as the dollar's
rise made gold less attractive for investors.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $443 a troy ounce, compared
with late Wednesday's $446.20. In Zurich, it closed at a bid $445,
slightly lower than $445.25 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $448.75, up from
$447.79.
   Silver bullion prices dipped on the London market, where silver
was trading at a late bid of $6.34 a troy ounce, compared with
Wednesday's $6.36 an ounce.

<HEAD>Canadian Dollar Tops 80 U.S. Cents For First Time In Four Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Canadian dollar, buoyed by higher interest
rates north of the border, rose to 80 U.S. cents Thursday for the
first time in four years.
   Analysts said the possibility that Central American instability
might drive prices higher for oil and other commodities was one
reason the Canadian currency's overnight rise from 79.9 U.S. cents
to 80.08 cents.
   Because of Canada's dependence on oil, grain, mineral and lumber
exports, the Canadian dollar is viewed on international exchanges
as a semi-commodity based currency.
   It had been testing the psychologically important 80-cent mark
for the past two weeks.
   ``The fundamentals support the Canadian dollar right now,'' said
money market specialist June Riley of the Royal Bank of Canada.
   ``The fact that we have not had strong intervention by the Bank
of Canada suggests that as long as the Canadian dollar is moving in
an orderly fashion, it could go higher.''
   She also attributed some of the overnight strengthening to
speculators, riding the Canadian currency's recent upswing.
   The higher Canadian dollar is bad news for American tourists,
who got $1.40 for their U.S. dollars two years ago and now get
$1.20 at hotels and stores. But for thousands of Canadians making
their annual late-winter pilgrimage to Florida or Arizona, the new
exchange rate is a windfall.
   The two dollars were last at par in 1976, and the Canadian
currency dipped to an all-time low of 69.13 U.S. cents in February
1986. It was last worth 80 cents on Feb. 24, 1984.
   It has risen 15 percent since then, with a 4-cent surge this
year after Governor John Crow of the Bank of Canada made it clear
that high interest rates will prevail until inflation is virtually
eradicated. Canada's annual inflation rate is now 4.1 percent.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government has been
more equivocal on the issue, under pressure from exporters whose
goods cost more as the dollar appreciates. Nearly 80 percent of
Canadian exports go to the United States.
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson said last week that interest
rates may dip as soon as inflation falls below 4 percent.
   But exporters' concerns were undermined this week when the
government reported better-than-expected merchandise trade figures
for January. Canada's surplus of 633 million dollars, or $506
million U.S., was up from December's surplus of 207 million
dollars, or $165 million.
   Key Canadian interest rates, such as for Eurodollar deposits,
are 1.5 percent higher than U.S. dollar rates.
   Other factors behind the Canadian currency's rise include the
anticipated strengthening of oil and commodity prices in the wake
of U.S. troop deployment in Honduras and the closing of the
trans-Panama oil pipeline, Riley said.

<HEAD>Strike Cuts Off Power to Alaskan Oil Pipeline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE CROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike by electrical workers cut off
power to the trans-Panama oil pipeline Wednesday, halting the flow
of Alaska North Slope crude oil to markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast,
state officials said.
   Electrical service was restored early Thursday, but then was
interrupted again, prompting the Panamanian government to announce
it was taking over all public utilities.
   The pipeline carries 650,000 barrels a day of Alaska oil,
roughly 10 percent of U.S. domestic production. A barrel is
equivalent to 42 gallons.
   BP America Inc. and its subsidiary Sohio Oil own two-thirds to
three-quarters of the oil flowing through the pipeline. The rest is
owned by Exxon Co. USA.
   The flow was halted at 2 p.m. EST Wednesday when electrical
workers joined a widespread strike against Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, said Tim Reynolds, a BP America spokesman in Washington,
D.C. The strike cut off power to a pump station at the foot of a
mountain, he said.
   BP America has a one-day supply of oil already on the Gulf of
Mexico side of Panama, and does not expect to initiate contingency
plans yet, Reynolds said.
   ``Nonetheless we are taking steps to set up a ship-to-ship
transfer operation so if necessary we can put at least some oil
through the Panama canal,'' he said.
   BP America is not sure how much oil it could move through the
canal. The amount would depend on the availability of small tankers
and canal congestion, Reynolds said.
   State officials, the Alaska congressional delegation and oil
companies also are studying alternatives including taking the oil
around Africa's Cape Horn or getting a waiver to the federal ban on
exports of Alaska oil.
   State officials have been worried about a Panama pipeline
shutdown because it could slow sales of Alaska crude, which account
for the bulk of state revenues.
   West Coast oil markets are glutted with Alaska oil, and the
federal export ban prevents its sale overseas.
   Chuck Logsdon, chief oil revenue analyst for the state, said the
Gulf Coast markets have been handling more than 600,000 barrels of
the total daily Alaska production of 1.8 million to 1.9 million
barrels.

   An increase in mortgage foreclosure and
delinquency rates in Texas is further evidence of regional economic
problems, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.
   The nationwide foreclosure and delinquency rates are improving,
but MBA spokesman Tom Marder said the figures, released Wednesday,
show that economic problems remain, particularly in the oil and
farm states.
   ``The trend nationally for two years has been toward lower
delinquency and foreclosure rates,'' Marder said. ``Obviously, some
of the regional problems still exist.''
   The association's figures show that at the end of the last
quarter, 1.56 percent of the mortgages surveyed in Texas were in
foreclosure, up from 1.53 percent for the same period last year.
   This gives Texas the ninth-highest foreclosure rate in the
nation.
   Another 8.72 percent were at least 30 days delinquent as of
December, a substantial increase from the 7.92 percent delinquent
as of the year before.
   Foreclosures nationwide represented 1.06 percent of the total
home loans, and 5.37 percent of the loans were delinquent.
   The association speculated three months ago that problems in the
oil patch appeared to be drying up after an improvement in the
third quarter. In that quarter, the survey showed 1.19 percent of
the loans in Texas were in foreclosure and another 7.64 percent
were delinquent.
   The MBA reported that although some regions have had
disappointing foreclosure and delinquency levels, ``the solutions
to these regional problems are of a long-term nature ... there is
reason to expect delinquencies to resume their previous downward
trend in due course.''
   Alaska and Wyoming ranked first and second on the list of
foreclosure and delinquency rates, while Rhode Island was last.
   Alaska, which also has been severely affected by the plunge in
oil prices, had 5.92 percent mortgages in foreclosure, up from 3.55
percent for the same period of last year. Alaska's delinquencies
also increased, to 11.85 percent in the past quarter, up from 10.18
percent.
   Next on the list was Wyoming, with 5.39 percent in foreclosure
last quarter, a decline from 5.84 percent in the same period of
last year. Wyoming also saw a slight improvement in its delinquent
loans, to 6.26 percent, a decline from the 7.90 registered last
year in the same quarter.
   Rhode Island had the lowest foreclosure rate of all states at
0.09 percent.

   Stocks rose in active trading today, buoyed by
corporate takeover maneuvering and favorable investor response to
the government's report of a lower-than-expected January trade
deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials advanced 11.28 points to
2,075.60 by 2 p.m. EST.
   Among broader market barometers, the NYSE's composite index of
all listed common stocks rose 0.80 to 152.08. The American Stock
Exchange's market value index rose 0.83 to 298.34.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by slightly more than a
3-to-2 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 902 up, 556 down
and 466 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board totaled 150.48 million
shares with two hours of trading left.
   Although the trade deficit reported by the Commerce Department
widened slightly in January to $12.4 billion from $12.2 billion in
December, market economists had expected an even greater gap of
about $13 billion.
   The news therefore provided an optimistic tone to stock trading

<HEAD>West Germany Supports Calls for European Central Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany officially gave its
support to the proposed establishment of a Western European central
bank that would be independent of Common Market governments.
   Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said Thursday that the
12-nation Common Market should free all movements of capital within
its borders and strengthen the European Monetary System in its
efforts to achieve closer economic cooperation and integration.
   ``Free capital movement without controls and limitations is the
most important monetary policy reform for the near future,''
Stoltenberg said.
   In a memorandum prepared for his fellow cabinet ministers and
other Western European governments, Stoltenberg reaffirmed West
Germany's commitment to closer economic integration among the
member nations of the European Economic Community.
   He also said that, at the end of the process, there should be a
European central bank.
   Stoltenberg's statement came less than three weeks after West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher proposed setting up
a European committee of experts to outline a course of action for
further European economic integration.
   The document adds further momentum to a discussion that started
late last year when French Economics Minister Edouard Balladur
proposed establishing a European central bank.
   Stoltenberg said in his memorandum that a European central bank
should be committed to price stability and should be independent of
both Common Market authorities and member governments.
   The central bank issue is expected to be discussed at the EEC
summit in Hanover, West Germany, on June 27 and 28.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, warned cable
television operators Thursday that Congress will consider
reregulating the industry if rates continue to rise and programming
is withheld from competitors.
   ``Some of us feel we were had'' by the congressional decision
that freed most cable operators of municipal rate control in
January 1987 and let them set their own prices, Metzenbaum said.
   ``This Congress is ready to re-examine that whole issue,'' said
Metzenbaum at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary's subcommittee on
antitrust, monopolies and business rights, which he chairs.
   Metzenbaum, the only senator present during much of the hearing,
said Congress is concerned that cable TV operators, an $11 billion
a year industry that serves 51 percent of American households,
enjoy a monopoly that can freeze out competing TV distribution
systems and raise prices.
   James P. Mooney, president of the National Cable Television
Association, disputed Metzenbaum's charge that cable prices have
``zoomed upwards'' by up to 400 percent in some areas since
deregulation.
   Mooney said an NCTA study shows that the average cable
subscriber's monthly bill rose 6.7 percent in the first six months
after deregulation. While basic service prices rose about 10.6
percent, rates for premium or pay channels, like Home Box Office,
dropped 2.5 percent, according to the study.
   Mooney said that while some people saw large increases in their
rates as cable companies realigned their services, most people paid
only a small increase and also received more channels than they did
before deregulation.
   Metzenbaum also said he was concerned about complaints by cable
competitors that distribute TV programming via microwave and
satellite that they are being strangled by the cable industry's
control over programming.
   Cable operators have a stake in many of the major satellite
programmers, like HBO, Showtime, Turner Broadcasting and MTV, he
said.
   George Kocian, spokesman for the Home Satellite Television
Association, which represents owners and dealers of home satellite
dishes, told the committee the cable industry has tried to prevent
the growth of the home dish market by controlling access to and the
price of programming.
   About 2 million households receive TV directly from backyard
dishes. Most programming is now scrambled, so a dish owner must
purchase a decoder costing about $400 to unscramble the signals.
   Kocian said the association does not oppose scrambling, but he
said dish owners should not have to pay the same prices as cable
subscribers since they have to incur more of the cost of service,
like buying a decoder and maintaining their dish antenna.
   ``Consumers are willing to pay a fair price,'' he said. ``But we
are not being treated fairly or equally.''
   Joseph Collins, president of HBO, the nation's largest pay TV
company, said backyard dish owners can subscribe to HBO's scrambled
signal directly from HBO or from a cable operator. Dish subscribers
pay about two-thirds the price that cable subscribers do, he said.
   ``There is no denial of access,'' he said.
   However, he said the company has had problems with
microwave-based TV delivery systems that distribute HBO programming
unscrambled. In such cases, nonsubscribers with an appropriate
antenna can intercept these transmissions and watch HBO for free,
he said.

   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said
Thursday he will announce new measures to bring stability to
dropping oil prices on March 22.
   Lukman's two-paragraph statement did not say what the measures
would involve. The statement said the measures would be announced
at a 10:00 a.m. (4 a.m. EST) press conference and should bring
stability to the volatile oil market.
   On Tuesday, Lukman accused the Western press of trying to
destabilize the oil market to bring down prices. He said OPEC would
not be stampeded into taking emergency measures to stop the fall of
oil prices.
   He said the cartel would stand firm on its decision to produce
15.6 million barrels of oil a day. A barrel is the equivalent of 42
gallons.
   Ministry sources, who declined to be identified, said Lukman
would call an emergency OPEC meeting soon after the March 22 press
conference if consultations between members promised meaningful
discussion at the meeting.
   The sources said price stability would be the main topic of
discussion if the meeting were held. A report by a private audit
team on the level of oil production among cartel members would also
be an issue.

   Grain and soybean futures prices posted strong
gains Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans were up more than 14 cents a bushel and wheat gained as
much as a nickel.
   A large speculator bought sizeable amounts of beans and soybean
products to offset earlier sales, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst
with Drexel, Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``That ignited it,'' he said. ``It prompted a lot of short
covering by commission houses.''
   Corn and wheat futures were helped by the rally in beans, said
Gustafson.
   ``Wheat also did well because there are indications the Chinese
are chartering some vessels, so maybe there's some new buying
coming in,'' he said.
   On the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $2.97{ a bushel; corn was 1\

<HEAD>SEC Tells Judge Campeau Bid Is an Amended Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission dealt
R.H. Macy & Co. Inc.'s bid for Federated Department Stores Inc. a
setback today by recommending to a federal judge that Campeau
Corp's. revised tender offer for Federated be regarded as an
amendment to a previous offer rather than a new bid.
   If the judge agrees, the Campeau bid could expire as scheduled,
more than two weeks before Macy's competing offer. Macy fears that
Federated shareholders will feel pressured to tender their shares
to Campeau because of the earlier deadline.
   In a ``friend of the court'' brief, the SEC told U.S. District
Judge Leonard Sand the revised bid announced by Campeau March 2 was
not a new offer, and as such did not have to remain open for 20
business days past its publication.
   The revised offer changed the number of shares Campeau was
seeking and the price to be paid for those shares.
   Macy has asked Sand to declare the latest Campeau bid a new
offer, which would keep it open past its scheduled expiration.
   Campeau announced today it was extending its offer beyond Friday
to midnight March 22. However, Sand ruled earlier this week that
both companies' offers must remain open for three business days
after his decision on the Macy challenge and on a Campeau suit that
seeks to invalidate Federated's shareholders rights plan.
   Sand had sought the SEC opinion on the Macy argument. It was not
known when he would make his ruling.
   Macy had no comment on the SEC's opinion, said Maureen Milano, a
spokeswoman for the retailer.
   A Campeau spokeswoman, Joele Frank, said ``We're pleased'' about
the SEC's opinion, but ``It's really up to the judge.''
   Macy, whose bid expires on April 4, wants a later expiration for
the Campeau offer because it would put the competing bids on a more
equal footing.
   Campeau claimed its offer cannot go forward while the rights
plan, known as a ``poison pill,'' remains in effect. The plan
allows current Federated shareholders to buy more of the company's
stock at a steep discount, making a takeover prohibitively
expensive.
   Macy is offering $77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million
Federated shares, for a total of $6.3 billion. Macy will exchange
shares in the merged company and issue convertible debt securities
for the remainder of Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares.
   Campeau is offering $75 in cash per share for 70.5 million
Federated shares, or a total of $6.18 billion. The remaining of
Federated stock would be acquired later for $44 cash per share in a
subsequent merger, giving the deal an aggregate value of $68 per
share.

<TEXT>
   Managers at Fairfax Publications (U.S.) Ltd.
said Thursday they are negotiating to buy Ms. and Sassy magazines
from the company's Australian parent.
   John Fairfax Ltd. of Sydney, which acquired Ms. in September and
launched Sassy five months later, officially put the magazines on
the block Wednesday. It was not known who else might be bidding for
the properties.
   Sandra Yates, president of Fairfax U.S., said she and vice
president Anne Summers began discussing a management-led buyout
with executives in Australia last December. Yates said a bid is now
on the table, although she declined to reveal any figures.
   Yates labeled as ``optimistic'' rumors that the Australian
company paid as much as $15 million for Ms., which was founded by
Gloria Steinem and Pat Carbine 16 years ago.
   In an interview last month, Yates acknowledged that start-up
costs for Sassy, a monthly magazine aimed at teen-age American
girls, totaled $10 million.
   The decision to sell the magazines is part of a wider sale of
assets to help finance the privatization of John Fairfax Ltd.
   Twenty-six-year-old Warwick Fairfax, who took his father's
company private last December, ``had to borrow significant funds to
buy out shareholders and has a large debt and needs to liquidate
assets,'' Yates explained.
   Mr. Fairfax has announced other belt-tightening measures at
company holdings in both Australia and London.
   Ms. circulation is holding steady at about 484,000 copies a
month, Yates said. Sassy was expected to have an initial
circulation of 250,000 and a goal of 1 million within five years.
Because only two issues of Sassy have been published, it is too
early to assess its circulation.
   Yates said both the acquisition of the badly undercapitalized
Ms. and the launching of Sassy by Fairfax were her idea. ``So
obviously I've always been very firmly convinced they could work.''
   Still, both magazines will require ``a substantial amount of
investment over the next couple of years _ many millions of dollars
before they come into profit because one is a turnaround and the
other is a start-up,'' Yates said.
   She said she did not think finding investors would be a problem.

   Manufacturing and retailing
conglomerate Wickes Cos. Inc. on Thursday posted a turnaround in
fourth-quarter earnings and a 116 percent jump in profits for its
fiscal year.
   However, earnings for the year ended Jan. 30 were boosted
primarily by $126.7 million in gains on assets sales and
extraordinary items.
   For the fourth quarter, the company netted $8.3 million, or 15
cents per share, compared to the year-earlier period when it had a
loss of $2.5 million.
   Revenues for the period were up 9.6 percent to $832.5 million
from $759.8 million, reflecting Wickes' acquisition of Collins &
Aikman Corp., the New York-based textile concern, in December 1986
for $1.16 billion.
   For the full year, the Wickes earned $180.5 million, or $3.68
per share, compared to the previous year when it earned $83.7
million, or $1.65 per share. The per-share figures for fiscal 1987
were restated to reflect a one-for-five reverse stock split that
took effect last August.
   Revenues for the past year were up 61.9 percent to $3.48 billion
from $2.15 billion.
   The company's income from continuing operations, which does not
include taxes or gains from assets sales and extraordinary items,
rose to $14.6 million from $3.1 million for the quarter, and
slipped to $69.1 million from $69.6 million for the year.

   The stock market closed higher today, helped by
takeover-related buying and a better-than-expected report on the
nation's trade deficit.
   But Wall Street strategists said the volume of trading did not
reflect a surge of investor confidence and probably was caused by
fears about the market's unpredictable behavior on ``triple
witching hour'' Friday.
   That quarterly event, so-named because of the near-simultaneous
expirations of contracts to buy or sell stock-index futures,
options and futures on individual stocks, has injected wildness
into the market in the past.
   ``I suspect traders are waiting for the triple witching hour to
get out of the way,'' said Philip C. Puccio, manager of
institutional trading at Dillon, Read & Co. in New York.

<HEAD>In Another Milestone, Japan Surpasses U.S. in Output Per Capita</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan overtook the United States last year in
economic output per person, according to a report Thursday that
highlighted that nation's relentless rise as an economic superpower.
   The report by Japan's Economic Planning Agency was the latest in
a string of reports on the island nation's growing wealth. For
example, the Tokyo Stock Exchange has become the world's largest,
and most of the world's largest banks are Japanese.
   The agency said Japan's per-capita gross national product _ the
output of goods and services for each member of the population _
reached the equivalent of $19,642 in 1987, compared with $18,403 in
the United States.
   Japan's ascendance was made possible partly by a strong 4.2
percent increase in its total gross national product. More
important, though, was a 17 percent rise in the value of the
Japanese yen vs. the dollar from one year to the next.
   When the yen is strong, it makes Japan's economic output more
valuable in terms of dollars. It also increases Japan's financial
muscle in the United States and other markets.
   ``As an economic power, the United States has already been
surpassed,'' Ezra Vogel, a Harvard University expert in East Asian
affairs, said in reaction to the report.
   ``The critical question is who has the leverage, who has the
strategy, who has the critical assets that influence the course of
world economic development,'' Vogel said.
   ``The key people who are able to make new loans are the
Japanese. People begin to look to the rules of the game as the
lender defines it,'' he said.
   ``Unfortunately, it's continuing to happen,'' he added. ``Japan
is continuing to collect more chips and the United States is
continuing to lose chips.''
   The report drew a different reaction from Japanese observers,
who contended it gives an unrealistic picture because it is based
on what they regard as an overvaluation of the Japanese yen vs. the
dollar.
   ``It's kind of magic _ numerical magic. It has no sense in real
life,'' said Yoshihisa Kitai, the economist in the New York office
of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
   Japan has indeed grown wealthier, but the Japanese people still
feel poor when they compare their buying power with that of
Americans, Kitai said. Land costs are high because of
overprotection of farmland, and an inefficient distribution system
keeps retail prices high, he said.
   In 1986, when calculations were based on $1 trading at 168.51
yen, the U.S. gross national product per capita was $17,464 and
Japan's was $16,330. In 1987, the calculations were based on $1 for
144.62 yen. The dollar currently is trading at about 127 yen.
   It is difficult to tell what nation has the highest gross
national product per capita because of drastic fluctuations from
year to year caused by exchange-rate shifts and the rise and fall
of oil prices.
   The United Arab Emirates was the world's leader in 1985 at
$19,120 per capita, followed by the Sultanate of Brunei at $17,580,
the United States at $16,400 and Switzerland at $16,380, according
to World Bank Atlas 1987. Japan ranked well back at $11,330, the
atlas said.
   Although more recent numbers are not available, it is known that
the oil-producing nations have fallen in rank because of lower oil
prices, while Western Europe and Japan have risen because of
stronger currencies.
   Japan had about 122 million people as of the middle of last
year, half of the United States' 244 million. But its economic
output is more than half that of the United States.
   Japan's inflation-adjusted GNP growth of 4.2 percent in the
calendar year 1987 was up from 2.4 percent the previous year,
helped by gains in housing and industrial equipment investment.
   The Economic Planning Agency said Japan's GNP grew by an
inflation-adjusted 1.7 percent in the October-December quarter from
the July-September quarter.
   The agency said the government's target of 3.7 percent growth
for fiscal 1987, which ends March 31, was in reach.
   The original target was 3.5 percent, but it was revised upward
in December based on signs of an encouraging recovery in the
manufacturing sector. Manufacturing earlier had been slumping
because of the yen's rise, which makes Japanese products more
expensive and less competitive abroad.

<HEAD>Irradiation Company Pleads Guilty To Safety Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A food and medical supply irradiation
company pleaded guilty Wednesday to covering up safety violations,
and authorities revealed that its founder _ a leading spokesman for
the preservation process _ was negotiating a plea arrangement with
prosecutors.
   Radiation Technology Inc. admitted that a false memorandum
saying it had stopped bypassing safety measures at its Rockaway
plant was prepared and given to Nuclear Regulatory Commission
investigators.
   Both the company and federal authorities have said no employees
or members of the public were injured because of the violations.
   The Morris Plains company, represented by its president, Allan
Booth, also admitted telling the NRC that a radiation safety
monitor was removed for only one night when it was actually removed
for several days while the plant was irradiating products.
   Radiation Technology, which also has plants in West Memphis,
Ark., Haw River, N.C., and Salem, uses radioactive Cobalt-60 to
sterilize medical supplies and foodstuffs, mainly spices.
   On Tuesday, prosecutors said Thomas Powell, who worked as
operations manager at the Rockaway plant from 1980 to 1985, pleaded
guilty to related charges.
   Powell admitted conspiring with others to have employees bypass
devices called conveyor door safety interlocks required under its
license. The safety locks automatically lower the highly
radioactive Cobalt-60 materials into a safety pool if they sense
the presence of people. Powell faces five years in prison, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacqueline Wolff.
   The company, which faces a $1 million penalty, admitted that
company officials prepared and backdated a memo dated Sept. 21,
1984, falsely saying that its employees had been ordered to stop
bypassing the interlock system.
   During a hearing, U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry asked
if there was a problem with plea negotiations with the company's
founder and former chairman, Martin Welt.
   Ms. Wolff responded that Welt had signed a plea agreement
admitting to related charges but had decided not to enter the plea.
   Later, Ms. Wolff said Welt's attorneys and her office had been
negotiating over a plea and that she did not know the reason why
Welt did not enter it.
   Welt has spoken frequently in the national media about the value
of food irradiation, and even traveled to China last year to
promote the process.
   Welt was forced to sever his links to Radiation Technology in
mid-1986 along with Powell after the NRC briefly suspended the
company's license for the interlock safety violations.
   Ms. Wolff said the safety systems were bypassed ``to keep the
business going.
   ``The interlocks were not operating properly. The thing to do is
shut it down,'' she said.
   In a prepared statement, the company said:
   ``By this guilty plea, RTI has acknowledged its legal
responsibility for the actions of an officer who submitted false
information to the NRC relating to known deficiences in equipment
designed to insure operator safety at RTI's Rockaway facility.''
   The company referred all further comment, including who the
official was, to its public relations firm, Solakian Associates.
   Mary Solakian said she was not familiar enough with Wednesday's
hearing to comment, and said her husband was out of the office and
could not be reached.
   In exchange for the company's guilty plea, the government agreed
not to further prosecute the firm on the matter and take no
position on sentencing unless the judge asks, said Ms. Wolff.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended March 7, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $2,954.5 billion in the latest week from $2,947.4 billion
te previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,725.4 billion from $3,721.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $755.6 billion from a revised $755 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $1.24 billion in
the week ended March 9, compared with a gain of $1.3 billion a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $153 million a day
in the week ended Wednesday, compared with $378 million in the
previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $272.1 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $272.4 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise on Trade Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices advanced Thursday in active trading,
lifted by a report on the nation's trade deficit for January that
was better than expected.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose about } point,
or $7.50 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price, dropped to 8.53 percent from 8.60 percent
late Wednesday.
   In a long-awaited report, the Commerce Department said the
merchandise trade deficit widened slightly in January to $12.4
billion after two months of sharp improvements. The news cheered
the credit markets despite the wider deficit, since most analysts
had expected a trade shortfall of around $13 billion.
   ``The numbers were pretty juicy,'' said Maria Ramirez, a
managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Bond prices have been pushed and pulled in recent months by data
on the nation's trade performance, mimicking the impact of the
figures on the value of the dollar. A positive trade showing tends
to bolster the U.S. currency and increase the value of
dollar-denominated investments such as bonds.
   Analysts said the market was unaffected by another government
report Thursday that U.S. factories, mines and utilities operated
at 82.4 percent of capacity in February, the third consecutive
month the operating rate has been at that level.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose 5-32 point to \ point, intermediate
maturities advanced 7-16 point to 17-32 point, and 20-year issues
gained 11-16 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc.,
a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.38 to 112.93. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, jumped 5.20
to 1,182.20.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, edged up 0.76 to 284.27.
   In the municipal bond market, the Bond Buyer index of 40
actively traded general obligation and revenue bonds rose 5-32
point to 88 27-32 as of 3 p.m. EST. The average yield declined to
8.07 percent from 8.09 percent late Wednesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, declined 4
basis points to 5.56 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point. Six-month bills fell 7 basis points to 5.72
percent and one-year bills dropped 8 basis points to 6.18 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 6 7-16 percent, up from 6]
percent late Wednesday.

   Back interest payments on Brazilian loans could
add $250 million to Citicorp's 1988 earnings, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John S. Reed said Wednesday.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company with assets
of $203.6 billion, is the leader of negotiations between banks and
the Brazilian government aimed at restructuring that country's debt.
   ``I believe Brazil is likely to reach an agreement with the
banks, but it is difficult to be assured of it,'' Reed told a news
conference before a luncheon address to the Economic Club of
Detroit.
   Whatever the success of the debt-restructuring talks, Brazil's
resumption of interest payments will be a boost, Reed said.
   And he said, ``We are quite positive about our own situation.''
   ``They have paid the interest for the fourth quarter of last
year. They are paying now the interest due for the first quarter of
this year but no one has booked it yet,'' he said. ``We are short
$200 million after tax, $333 million before tax, from Brazil. So we
have the potential of booking in this year one-quarter billion
dollars.''
   Brazil, which owes more than $112 billion abroad and has not
repaid any principal since 1983, stopped paying interest on bank
debts in February 1987.
   Citicorp was the first bank to respond, in May 1987, by boosting
loan-loss reserves, increasing them during the year by about $3
billion.
   That and other steps ``confused'' Citicorp's earnings picture
for 1987, Reed said. Citicorp reported a loss of $1.13 billion for
1987, compared with net income of $1.05 billion in 1986.
   In 1988, he said, ``We expect to return to a normal year.''
   Reed said predictions of slower consumer-spending growth this
year may have been excessively conservative, as indicated by
healthy auto sales and home mortgage activity thus far.
   Mortgage applications to Citicorp, which accounts for 6 percent
of the nation's single-family home loans, have been higher than
expected in the past 30 days, he said.

<HEAD>UAW, Chrysler Looking at April 18th Start of Early Contract Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. would like to begin early contract
negotiations with the United Auto Workers on April 18 _ that is, if
Chrysler's top bargainer isn't serving on a jury.
   Anthony St. John, the company's lead negotiator, said Wednesday
that Chrysler has settled on the tentative date for the start of
talks on a contract covering 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off
workers and wants a settlement deadline for sometime in June.
   UAW spokesman Bob Barbee said the date won't be confirmed until
UAW Vice President Marc Stepp is sure it will fit into a schedule
crammed with negotiations with other companies including General
Dynamics.
   In general, Barbee said, ``it sounds reasonable.''
   But St. John, Chrysler's vice president for human resources,
also has a conflict: He's been called to jury duty in Oakland
County Circuit Court for April 18-19.
   ``I'm trying to get out of jury duty,'' he said. ``This is my
third summons. I asked to postpone one to attend a board meeting.''
   As a lawyer _ he began his labor relations career arguing cases
for the National Labor Relations Board _ St. John said he is
automatically excluded from jury duty in most states, but not in
Michigan.
   Next week, the UAW's elected 10-member bargaining committee
meets in Tampa, Fla., with Stepp and other union officials to
prepare demands. Its 140-member national Chrysler council meets
April 5-7 in Missouri to approve them.
   Chrysler's three-year contract expires Sept. 14. Talks normally
begin in mid-July, but Chrysler asked for the early start after the
UAW forced it to reverse a plan to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar
Inc. parts subsidiary.
   In cooperative union-management programs that reach from the
executive suite to the plant floor, the two sides have begun
working together to find ways to improve Chrysler's production
quality and efficiency.
   They are considered crucial to the survival of any auto company
battling for its share of an intensely competitive market. But
``negotiations tend to put everything into a kind of holding
pattern,'' St. John said.
   Chrysler will work within the job-protecting pattern contracts
established for the industry last fall at Ford Motor Co. and
General Motors Corp., but will try to mold the pattern to
Chrysler's needs, he said.

   The nation's factories, mines and utilities
operated at 82.4 percent of capacity in February, the third
consecutive month the operating rate has been at that level, the
Federal Reserve said Thursday.
   Even though the February rate was the same as December and
January, those two months were revised up slightly in the newest
report, a fact that private economists said was encouraging.
   ``Slowly, but surely, capacity utilization is marching higher,
showing that the industrial sector remains strong,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Before the revision, the operating rate in December and January
had been put at 82.2 percent.
   The report said that the February operating rate was held back
by further cutbacks in production at auto plants and a big drop in
coal production.
   Before the year began, analysts expressed fears that the economy
could weaken significantly due to widespread cutbacks in production
as businesses tried to work off a huge supply of unsold goods which
had been built up in the last part of 1987.
   While high inventories have led to cuts in auto production, many
other industries, such as textiles, chemicals, and paper, have
continued to have high operating rates.
   Analysts have recently been boosting their forecasts for growth
in the first quarter of 1988 based on a belief that the weakness
from production cutbacks was overstated.
   Manufacturing, which was in a virtual recession in 1985 and 1986
because of the country's large trade deficit, began to rebound last
year as the weaker dollar made American products competitive once
again on overseas markets.
   Continued strength in manufacturing this year is expected to be
the principal force keeping the country out of a recession.
   The 82.4 percent industrial operating rate is the highest
overall operating rate since March 1980. The operating rate plunged
to 69.5 percent during the depths of the 1981-82 recession.
   In February, the operating rate at manufacturing plants remained
unchanged at 82.4 percent of capacity, reflecting an operating rate
of 80.1 percent at factories making durable goods and a production
rate of 85.9 percent of capacity at plants making nondurable goods.
   Paper, a non-durable good, had the highest operating rate of any
industry at 95.8 percent of capacity, with textile plants close
behind at 91.9 percent and chemical plants at 86.5 percent.
   Auto plants operated at 77 percent of capacity in February, down
from 77.4 percent in January and a full 5 percentage points below
the operating rate in October. Sales have rebounded in recent weeks
and analysts believe that auto operating rates should start to move
higher.
   The mining industry operated at 80.6 percent of capacity in
February, down from 81.1 percent in January. The decline was
attributed to a drop in production at coal mines.
   U.S. utilities operated at 82.2 percent of capacity last month,
up from 81.7 percent in January.
   The overall operating rate of 82.4 percent was more than two
percentage points higher than the 79.7 percent operating rate in
February 1987.

   South Korea is considering making an
infusion of money to the International Monetary Fund's lending
operations, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
   Ministry officials said the proposed funds would be for the
IMF's Structural Adjustment Facility, which extends loans to help
finance economic development in the Third World.
   Officials said the government had not decided how much Korea
should provide, but that the sum might be close to the $90 million
cited in local news reports.
   Ministry officials also said the government was studying
additional capital subscriptions to the IMF, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank in response to requests from the three
organizations. But they said the size of the capital contributions
remained to be negotiated.
