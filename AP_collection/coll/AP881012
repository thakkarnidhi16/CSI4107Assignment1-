   A state-by-state poll of nearly 10,000 likely
voters Wednesday rated George Bush as solidly ahead in the race for
the presidency, saying he held a huge lead in the contest for
electoral votes.
   Although polls of the nation as a whole indicate a close race
between Bush and Michael Dukakis, the ABC News-Washington Post
survey of the standings in each state _ where the election actually
is decided _ put Bush firmly ahead.
   ABC reported that Bush led solidly in 21 states with a total of
220 electoral votes _ just 50 short of the total needed to win.
Dukakis was firmly ahead in three states and Washington, D.C., for
30 electoral votes.
   With the election nearly a month off, voter sentiments can
change. But the ABC-Post poll, the only public survey of its size
this year, was the first recent poll to indicate a significant
advantage for either candidate.
   ``It's interesting and encouraging,'' Bush told ABC. ``I don't
know what the other fellow has. But look, we've just got a game
plan. Stay with it. And if polls are encouraging it makes me feel
good, but I also remember when they weren't.''
   The poll was conducted from Sept. 21 through Monday among 9,778
likely voters in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Its
margins of error varied by state from five points to 10 points.
   ABC and the Post also conducted a standard national survey that
put the race at 51 percent for Bush to 45 percent to Dukakis. A CBS
News-New York Times poll Wednesday had nearly the same result:
50-45.
   Such national polls measure popular sentiment across the nation
as a whole. But in the election each state gives its electoral
votes to the winner in that state, so the state-by-state standings
are more relevant to the outcome. Such polls are rarely done
because conducting polls in each state requires a far larger sample
than surveying the nation as a whole.
   According to the Post, from 100 to 500 voters were interviewed
in each state. The Post noted that there are many potential sources
of error in the poll, including the length of time it took to
conduct the survey.
   The states that ABC put firmly in Bush's column included Texas,
where recent state polls have given him a 10-point lead; New
Jersey, where he led by eight points in a state poll last week; and
Ohio, where he led in a state poll a month ago by just four points.
   Also, the states that it said leaned toward Bush included New
York, where most other recent polls have shown a slight Dukakis
lead; and California, where most recent polls have found a tie.
   These are the states that ABC said firmly favored Bush: Alaska,
Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine,
Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia
and Wyoming.
   It said these were leaning for Bush: Alabama, California,
Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri,
Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee.
   ABC rated these states a tossup: Arkansas, Colorado, Montana,
Rhode Island, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin.
   Firmly favoring Dukakis it said, were Hawaii, Massachusetts and
Minnesota, and the District of Columbia. Leaning for Dukakis were
Illinois, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Vermont.
   The CBS-Times poll, meanwhile, found increasing doubt about the
qualifications of the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen.
Dan Quayle, to serve as president, and it indicated the concern was
keeping the race a close one in terms of the popular contest
nationally.
   By a 2-1 margin, probable voters in the CBS-Times poll doubted
Quayle's qualifications for the presidency, his worst rating in
that survey. He was seen as qualified by only 30 percent, while
twice as many _ 63 percent _ said they would worry about him
serving as president.
   Quayle's presence appeared to help Dukakis: Asked if they could
vote only for president, without considering the running mate,
support for Dukakis dipped from 45 percent to 41 percent. Bush's
support remained at 50 percent.
   Another poll Wednesday, by Louis Harris and Associates, put the
popular contest at 50-48. It also said Dukakis may be helped a bit
by concern over Quayle; asked to chose between Bush and Dukakis
only, without their running mates mentioned, Dukakis dipped from 48
to 46 percent support. Bush remained at 50 percent.
   Harris polled 1,355 likely voters Oct. 6 through Monday. Its
poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   The smaller, national ABC-Post poll was done Oct. 5 through
Tuesday among 1,187 likely voters nationwide; The CBS-Times poll
was done Oct. 8 through Monday among 1,009 probable voters. Both
had four-point margins of error.

   A hotel owner criticized for throwing Adolf
Hitler birthday parties for his employees said Wednesday he plans
to donate his collection of Nazi material to a planned Holocaust
museum in Washington.
   Ralph Engelstad, 58, who owns the Imperial Palace hotel and
casino, said he began discussions Wednesday with officials of the
U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council toward donating the Nazi items.
   ``We have offered it. They have expressed interest in having
it,'' Engelstad said.
   Engelstad, who earlier painted over a Nazi wall mural and
scrapped plans to display the Nazi items at his car museum, said he
hoped the planned donation to the Holocaust museum would end the
flap over his activities.
   ``As I said earlier, I now feel I have done what can be done,''
Engelstad said, reading from a statement. ``I have apologized for
what cannot be undone.''
   Engelstad said he hoped to donate the various Nazi artifacts to
a Holocaust museum that is being planned by the council in
Washington. But he said he would keep the various cars he has
bought that are related to the Nazi regime.
   In a letter to the Jewish Federation of Las Vegas on Tuesday,
Engelstad said he would sell the collection of Nazi-era cars,
motorcycles, posters and other items and turn the room into a
warehouse.
   ``I have not been successful to date in convincing you that my
apology for my insensitivity to Jewish concerns was heartfelt and
sincere,'' Engelstad wrote.
   ``In retrospect, I realize that what was missing in my apology
was an acknowledgement of the specific hurt and pain felt by the
Jewish community over this issue,'' he said.
   Engelstad, a former goaltender on the University of North
Dakota's hockey team, announced plans earlier this year to set up a
$5 million endowment to benefit the university's hockey program.
   The school's Winter Sports Center was subsequently renamed Ralph
Engelstad Arena.
   Officials said the university doesn't plan to reject Engelstad's
money and won't change the name of the hockey venue. But school
President Thomas Clifford said school officials would watch the
controversy for any new developments, and ``we're keeping our
options open.''
   Engelstad, a native of Thief River Falls, Minn., has apologized
for the two Hitler parties, which he held in 1986 and earlier this
year.
   ``In retrospect, they were not only stupid but insensitive, but
at the time they were merely excuses for parties,'' Engelstad said,
adding that he threw parties often for his employees.
   Engelstad's collection included a portrait of Hitler, signed
``To Ralphie from Adolf 1938,'' and a bumper sticker inscribed
``Hitler Was Right.''
   Engelstad has said the portrait was sent to him by a Phoenix
broker as a joke after he purchased a number of German vehicles.
Engelstad did not authorize the bumper stickers and found them
offensive, he said.

<TEXT>
   Actor Ken Murray, whose 30-year career
spanned the vaudeville stage and films including the 1962 motion
picture ``The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,'' died Wednesday. He
was 85.
   The Beverly Hills resident died of natural causes at St. Joseph
Medical Center in Burbank, said his publicist Jeffrey Godsick.
Murray was born Don Court in New York City in 1903.
   His film career began from the 1930s and continued until the
late 1960s. He is best remembered for his long-running Hollywood
stage appearances in ``Ken Murray's Blackout,'' which ran from 1942
to 1949.
   He produced ``Bill & Coo,'' a feature-length fantasy film about
birds that received a special Academy Award in 1947 for ``novel and
entertaining use'' of the film medium.
   He also starred, produced and directed television's ``The Ken
Murray Show.'' Other television credits include ``Hollywood Without
Makeup,'' ``Hollywood, My Home Town,'' and ``El Coyote.''
   His motion picture debut was in ``Half-Marriage'' in 1929. Other
films included ``Leathernecking,'' ``You're A Sweetheart,'' 1937;
``A Night at Earl Carroll's,'' 1940; ``Juke Box Jenny,'' 1942;
``Son of Flubber,'' 1963; ``The Power,'' 1968 and ``Ken Murray's
Shooting Stars'' a homemade 16mm film Murray shot recording the
day-to-day lives of his contemporaries. The candid scenes have been
internationally distributed as classic vignettes of the golden age
of Hollywood.
   Murray also wrote books including ``The Body Merchant,'' ``Life
on a Pogo Stick,'' and ``The Golden Days of San Simeon.''

   Neither George Bush nor Michael Dukakis came in contact with the
voters on Wednesday, huddling instead with their handlers to go
over lines for Thursday's second and final presidential debate of
the campaign.
   Bush, buoyed by an ABC News-Washington Post poll giving him a
huge lead in electoral votes nationwide, staged a brief
made-for-television event before disappearing into his debate
preparation meetings. He invited Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl
Gates in for breakfast in a subtle continuation of his effort to
make crime control a central theme of his candidacy.
   The vice president told reporters he intended to show the
country ``what my heartbeat is'' during his face-to-face clash with
Dukakis and said he would continue depicting his rival as a
liberal. Bush also attended the National League playoff game
between the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets after wrapping up
his debate preparation for the day.
   He shared a box with his wife, Barbara, Dodger owner Peter
O'Malley, and campaign chairman James A. Baker III.
   Democrat Dukakis had baseball on his mind as well as he
interrupted his debate homework to play catch with an aide while
photographers recorded the scene. Referring to the first
presidential debate and the one last week between running mates, he
said, ``We're ahead 2-0; we're going to make it a clean sweep.''
   Dukakis will need a clean sweep to overcome the kind of lead
that Bush has in the newest poll, which surveyed 10,000 likely
voters from Sept. 21 through Monday.
   ABC reported that Bush led solidly in 21 states with a total of
220 electoral votes _ just 50 short of the total needed to win.
Dukakis was firmly ahead in only three states and the District of
Columbia with 30 electoral votes.
   With the election nearly a month off, voter sentiments can
change. But the ABC-Post poll, the only public survey of its size
this year, was the first recent poll to indicate a significant
advantage for either candidate.
   The poll's margins of error varied by state from five points to
10 points. The Post said from 100 to 500 voters were interviewed in
each state.
   Dukakis described his debate repertoire in baseball lingo, as
well, saying he would use a ``fastball, curve, slider _ maybe a
knuckler'' during his 90 minutes on stage.
   Workers in Los Angeles erected a debate-night set _ wooden
lecterns, red carpet and telegenic blue background _ that was
trucked in from Omaha, where it was used in last week's vice
presidential debate. The debate begins at 9 p.m. EDT on the UCLA
campus in Los Angeles.
   Bush goes into the 90-minute encounter with a modest lead in the
public opinion polls, although Dukakis appears to have cut into the
Republican advantage since last week's vice presidential debate.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, the subject
of anonymous criticism from senior Bush advisers since that debate,
said as he set out on his daily campaign rounds that if he finds
out who was talking, ``I think there will be staff changes.''
   Quayle uttered a seeming declaration of independence after
saying his campaign appearances had been so tightly scripted by
Bush advisers that he was told when he could wave as he got off his
campaign plane.
   ``That's all been thrown away,'' he said. ``I am my own handler,
and if you have any questions, ask me.'' He said he would take
advice from Bush's aides ``under consideration.''
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen had a ready retort for that idea. ``That
may be his pitch, but I'll bet it's thrown George Bush a real curve
ball,'' he said of his vice presidential rival. The Texas senator
campaigned through Missouri and Arkansas, where he said the
Republicans ``refuse to stand up for the American economy.''
   With election day still more than three weeks away, there was
fresh evidence that presidential politics is eternal.
   One Democratic official already was speculating that the Iowa
caucuses, the lead-off contest in the last several campaigns, might
be moved back in the election calendar if the Democrats lose the
White House this year. ``I think that the cry would be very loud
for a different look at the nominating system,'' said Democratic
Vice Chair Lynn Cutler, a former Iowan now living in Washingon.
   Bush's breakfast with Republican supporter Gates came as the
vice president worked hard to make crime a key issue. In speeches
throughout the country, he has sharply criticized Dukakis' record
on crime, citing a Massachusetts prison program under which a
murderer escaped while on furlough and attacked a Maryland couple.
Some Democratic strategists say the issue is particularly effective
against Dukakis in California, the nation's largest state.
   Bush said he believes he is in a stronger position politically
than before the first residential debate on Sept. 25 and added that
his goal for Thursday night is to have the voters understand ``what
my heartbeat is, what I really care about.''
   As for Dukakis, Walter F. Mondale, the losing 1984 Democratic
presidential candidate, said the 1988 nominee should loosen up in
front of the television cameras. Mondale said in St. Paul, Minn.,
that he knows Dukakis as a ``very warm nice person'' but that that
side of his personality hasn't come across on television.
   Bush had his No. 1 surrogate campaigner at work, with President
Reagan traveling in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   In a speech to high school students in Upper Darby, Pa., Reagan
touted the economic expansion since the recession early in his term
of office and said, ``In the last eight years we've worked to
return America's values to all areas of American government.''

   The Dodgers won the National League pennant
Wednesday night by beating the favored New York Mets 6-0 in the
seventh game of a playoff.
   Los Angeles will be host of Game 1 of the 85th major league
baseball World Series on Saturday against Oakland. It is a rematch
of the 1974 Series won by the Athletics in five games.
   Orel Hershiser, who pitched a five-hitter for the Dodgers,
finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings.
We was credited for the win, after starting playoff Games 1 and 3
without getting a decision but getting a save for Game 4.
   The pennant is the Dodgers' ninth championship since moving to
Los Angeles in 1958 from Brooklyn, and their first since 1981, when
they went on to beat the New York Yankees in the World Series.
   The Dodgers scored first in six of the seven games against the
Mets and made things easy for Hershiser by scoring a run in the
first inning Wednesday off losing pitcher Ron Darling. Los Angeles
then chased him with five runs in the second as New York made three
sloppy fielding plays.
   Hershiser had five strikeouts, two walks and two hit batsmen in
pitching the third shutout in a series-deciding game in playoff
history. Catfish Hunter of Oakland beat Baltimore 3-0 in the final
game of the 1973 AL playoff and Danny Cox of St. Louis shut out San
Francisco 6-0 last year in the NL playoff.

   Brown University and its food service,
plant operations and library workers reached a contract agreement
on Wednesday just hours before a midnight strike dedline.
   After two days of negotiations, the Ivy League school agreed to
pay full health insurance premiums for members of Local 134 of the
Service Employees International union.
   ``We feel that we have a great victory here,'' said Karen
McAninch, the union's business agent.``The important thing is we
got 100 percent Blue Cross coverage for the life of the agreement.''
   A three-year contract for the 250 plant and food workers
provided a 5.5 percent pay increase in the first year and a 5
percent increase in the remaining two years. The 90 library workers
received a two-year contract that gave them a 5.5 percent increase
in the first year and a 5 percent raise in the second.
   The contract was ratified by a show of hands by the plant and
food workers and by a 50-21 vote from the library workers, McAninch
said.
   The workers earlier this month authorized a strike for midnight
Wednesday, when the contract covering plant and food workers
expires. The contract for the library workers expired on Aug. 19.
   ``Both sides gave substantially in the interest of harmony to
get the matter resolved,'' said Robert Reichley, a university
spokesman. ``In the long run it may not be the best solution for
both sides, but at least it averted a strike.''
   On Tuesday, Brown officials offered a higher wage increase, but
said they would pay only half the insurance premiums for the first
year and 60 percent of following increases.
   McAninch said the principle of cost shifting was as important as
the numbers.
   ``They knew that we were serious about striking and that we felt
very strongly about the issues,'' she said. ``We had a lot of
support from Brown University students.''

   This Central African nation kept a long
official silence on AIDS, but now is attacking the epidemic openly
and plans to test 10,000 people in its first survey of the deadly
disease.
   ``We know that it is a difficult problem, but we are trying to
do what we can do,'' said Dr. N'Galy Bosenge, leader of Zaire's
national AIDS committee.
   Reporters visiting Kinshasa in the past had to seek information
from Western health officials or private organizations involved in
fighting AIDS.
   N'Galy, whose business card shows a skull in the middle of a
heart beneath the French abbreviation for AIDS, now admits them to
his office without demanding government authorization and even
takes telephone queries from journalists in Europe.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, for which no cure has been
found, is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Although homosexuals have been the main victims in developed
countries, the disease has spread among heterosexuals in Africa.
   This may be because of the unchecked spread of other sexually
transmitted diseases, which speed the transmission of AIDS; because
of contaminated syringes and blood supplies, and because there are
comparatively few homosexuals on the continent.
   World Health Organization spokesman Thomas Netter said by
telephone from the U.N. agency's Geneva headquarters that African
countries have quickened their AIDS programs in the past 18 months.
   ``It's an acknowledgment that this is a problem and ... it's no
longer seen as some sort of a stigma,'' he said. ``I think people
have gotten over that.''
   African nations were reporting five to 10 cases 18 months ago
but now the total is about 19,000, he said.
   Tanzania recently held an international AIDS conference, and
Gabon did the same in June.
   Zaire and several other countries have begun aggressive
education campaigns that use comic books, popular music, television
and theater.
   South Africa's daily newspaper for blacks, The Sowetan, began a
column on AIDS this week, which warns that promiscuity facilitates
transmission of the disease.
   A WHO statement Friday said reported AIDS cases worldwide rose 7
percent to 119,818 in September, with updated figures from Malawi,
Tanzania and Kenya accounting for most of the increase.
   Malawi listed 2,586 cases, more than four times the number in
its last report Oct. 31, 1987; Tanzania reported 3,055 cases,
nearly twice the total of Oct. 17, 1988, and Kenya reported 2,732
cases, up one-third from a March 31, 1988, report that also showed
a big increase.
   Zaire has reported only 335 cases. N'Galy said his government
knows the figure is many times that, but ``we just didn't do a very
good job. ... We can't verify it yet.''
   N'Galy said he was preparing a new total figure.
   The government has been sensitive because of press reports
describing Zaire as the birthplace of AIDS and because of the
reaction to reports of a survey that found 6 percent to 8 percent
of the staff of a Kinshasa hospital to be sero-positive.
   ``It was regarded as a national catastrophe,'' Ngaly said.
   Officials in Uganda say their openess about AIDS has resulted
wrongly in that East African country being labeled an AIDS
epicenter. Dr. Sam Okware, head of Uganda's AIDS control program,
said the number of cases doubles every six months.
   N'Galy said Zaire is preparing its first general AIDS survey in
cooperation with WHO, and about 10,000 people will be tested.
   He said it probably will find a sero-positive rate somewhere
between the 6 percent to 8 percent at the hospital and the 3
percent to 4 percent found in tests at a Kinshasa factory.
   The survey's purpose is ``to evaluate the success of our AIDS
education program,'' N'Galy said. ``The most important thing is to
check the rate of AIDS infection. We are confident that people
understand the need for change, but it is a long-term effort.
Perhaps we will be able to save some lives.''
   Netter said the survey ``probably will come up with a lot of
cases,'' but added: ``The most significant thing is that there is a
program in place to find out what the extent of the problem is and
how to go about doing something about it.''
   Dennis Chandler, director of the U.S. Agency for International
Development in Zaire, said condom sales have gone from virtually
zero to 100,000 monthly in Kinshasa and surveys indicate most
residents know as much about AIDS as people in the United States.
   Reports indicate the disease may not be spreading to rural
areas, and ``in many villages the sero-positive rate remains
zero,'' according to N'Galy.
   Tests in Kinshasa of pregnant women and blood donors also
suggest the general incidence of AIDS infection is not rising, but
the infection rate among prostitutes has grown from 27 percent to
40 percent.

<TEXT>
   The University of Mississippi suspended the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity Tuesday after an ``extended period
of disruptive behavior'' that included a member being charged with
raping a sorority pledge.
   And in Orono, Maine, the University of Maine withdrew
recognition of a sorority after a hazing inciden in which pledges
allegedly were branded with a heated metal stamp.
   The earliest the Mississippi fraternity will be eligible to
return to campus is Jan. 1, said Gordon Beasley, university vice
chancellor for student affairs.
   Last month, the university banned all on-campus
fraternity-sorority parties when a freshman Chi Omega Sorority
pledge said she was raped after attending a mixer held by the
fraternity and the sorority.
   That party was held off-campus because the fraternity was
already on social probation because of a rush infraction and was
prohibited from having on-campus parties.
   Stover Smith, 18, of Metairie, La., was freed late last month on
$50,000 bond after being arrested on rape charges, said Oxford
Police Chief Billy White. The woman told officers that she left the
party and was driven to a field, then beaten and raped, White said.
   University officials said the rape charge was not the only
reason for the suspension of the fraternity, but it was a
contributing factor. The unversity began an investigation into the
fraternity's activities after the incident.
   The suspension means removal of all fraternity members from the
campus chapter and the placing of the chapter in the hands of an
alumni committee, Beasley said.
   The identities of the victims in the Sept. 25 incident in Maine,
said to have occurred in a Bangor cemetery, were not disclosed.
Officials said a preliminary investigation found that two pledges
had suffered burns.
   An associate dean, William Lucy, said the burns had been
characterized as minor.
   Hazing is prohibited by both state law and school policy,
university officials said.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Says France Will Remain Its Own Master</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand has reaffirmed that
France will remain its own master on defense issues, saying
France's ``mission was not to assure the protection of any other
West European country.''
   That task, he said Tuesday, belonged to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   Mitterrand said, however, that a French president could realize
France's vital interests were affected by events beyond its borders
and, for example, come to the aid of its neighbor West Germany in
an emergency.
   Other points Mitterrand made in a major policy speech to the
Institute of Higher Defense Studies:
   _France's new mobile short-range Hades nuclear missiles should
not become theatre or battlefield weapons, but serve as a final
warning to an enemy that a nuclear confrontation was starting.
   _France would continue to modernize its mainly submarine-based
nuclear deterrent, but would also update a missile complex in
southern France.
   _France retains the capability of building a neutron bomb at any
moment.
   _France will not join any negotiations on reducing strategic
nuclear weapons until deep cuts were made in the arsenals of both
superpowers.
   _France opposes deployment of weapons in space as envisaged in
the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   _France will keep its chemical weapons capability until an
international ban on their manufacture and use is negotiated.
   Mitterrand said the main objective of French defense policy was
to ``maintain our identity, our independence,'' which is why ``we
have our own strategy of nuclear deterrence.''
   He said France was committed to achieving nuclear disarmament
and hailed the U.S.-Soviet accord to ban intermediate-range nuclear
weapons as one of the major events since the end of World War II.
   He said France will remain a reliable member of the Western
alliance without ``abandoning its autonomy of decision'' with
regard to NATO's integrated military command structure.
   Gen. Charles de Gaullle took France out of this structure in
1966.
   Mitterrand said in the event of war, France ``will be present
from the first minute with all its forces, including nuclear ones,
provided that this was within the framework of the alliance.''
   He remarked that Europe's common defensive capabilities could be
strengthened in 1993 after the European Economic Community
established a single market.
   Mitterrand warned any attack against France's land-based
missiles would mean ``we were at war and the unleashing of our
strategic weapons would be instantaneous.''
   The president said with regard to France's short-range nuclear
weapons, such as the Pluton or Hades missiles, that these weapons
would be used only against military targets.
   The Hades, to be deployed in eastern France by 1992, has a range
of about 280 miles, barely enough to reach targets in East Germany
or other Warsaw Pact countries.
   Newspaper reports last month, denied by Mitterrand aides, said
France was considering delaying or canceling the Hades program.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to UPDATE with 10:30 p.m. location of storm</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A depression in the mid-Atlantic became Tropical
Storm Joan Tuesday, packing top sustained winds of 40 mph on a
course that forecasters said could threaten the Lesser Antilles in
two or three days.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Joan was centered near 12.0 north latitude
and 49.5 west longitude, or about 700 miles east of Barbados,
moving west-northwest at 15 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.
   Little change in strength was expected Tuesday night, and Joan
was expected to maintain the same speed and direction for the next
24 hours, the center said.
   Joan is the 10th tropical storm of the Atlantic season, which
runs from June through November. Depressions are upgraded to
tropical storms when sustained winds reach 39 mph and become
hurricanes when winds hit 74 mph.
   Four hurricanes have formed this season, including Hurricane
Gilbert, which killed more than 300 people and caused billions of
dollars in damages as it ravaged Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and
Mexico.

<HEAD>Labor Fights For Crucial Sephardi Vote In Likud Strongholds</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RAMLE, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cheering children greeted Moroccan-born
David Levy, the No. 2 man in the right-wing Likud bloc, during a
campaign stop in this town where two-thirds of the residents are
Jews of North African origin.
   When Shimon Peres, head of the left-of-center Labor Party,
campaigned in Ramle's open-air market last week, he was jostled and
booed. Likud supporters shouted ``traitor'' and ``Peres go home.''
   The contrasting receptions underscore Labor's continuing
difficulties in winning the support of the Sephardim, Jews of
Middle Eastern and North African origin. They make up 55 percent of
the 2.1 million Israeli voters and will be crucial in determining
the outcome of the Nov. 1 elections.
   In 1984, 70 percent of the Sephardim voted for the Likud, and
this time, ``there is still a strong element of identification with
the Likud,'' said a pollster for the Labor-affiliated Decima
polling company, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   However, Labor pollsters said they expected a dip of about 5
percent in Sephardic support for Likud, providing an opening for
Labor to campaign aggressively among Sephardic voters.
   A key target group are young, financially successful Sephardim
born in Israel who make up about half of the 5 percent of the
voters wavering between Labor and Likud, said the Decima pollster.
   They might determine the election because polls show Labor and
Likud running neck-to-neck.
   Sephardic voting power first became evident in 1977 when Labor
was ousted from the government after 29 years because Sephardim
voted for the Likud in massive numbers.
   The Sephardic identification with Likud has its roots in the
1950s and 1960s when Labor, at the time dominated by Western-born
Ashkenazim, often was arrogant toward the North African newcomers.
   Today, most Sephardim still feel greater affinity toward Likud
than Labor, but after 11 years of the Likud government, some
supporters are becoming more critical.
   ``I will vote for the Likud again, but it's not what it used to
be in the times of (former Likud Prime Minister Menahem) Begin,''
said Yehuda Cohen, 36, a taxi driver in Ramle where 70 percent of
the votes traditionally go to Likud.
   ``Labor was in the government for 30 years, and became corrupt.
Now the same thing is happening to the Likud,'' he added.
   ``Likud can no longer say `the Sephardim belong to us,''' said
his colleague, Eli Zarfati, a former Likud voter who is now leaning
toward Labor.
   Political analyst Daniel Elazar warned that the Likud might be
overestimating its hold on Sephardic voters.
   ``The Likud is convinced they have the Sephardim in their back
pocket. I don't think they do,'' said Elazar, head of the Jerusalem
Center for Public Policy, a think tank.
   ``If the Likud had been better at governing and had not been
associated with inflation and the war in Lebanon, their position
with the Sephardim would have been unassailable,'' he added.
   Labor officials say they are making inroads, mainly because
Labor candidates for the 120-member Parliament includes 16
Sephardim.
   In addition, Peres, currently the foreign minister, is making
many campaign appearances in predominantly Sephardic areas.
   But Levy, who as deputy prime minister is the highest-ranking
Sephardi in the Cabinet, played down the importance of the ethnic
vote.
   ``Forty years have passed. Time has come to do away with the
labels of Sephardim and Ashkenazim and to relate to people as
Israeli citizens,'' Levy told The Associated Press.
   During a tour of Ramle on Tuesday, Levy was greeted by more than
100 school children, many of them chanting the party's slogan:
``Only Likud Can.''
   Likud spokeswoman Odelia Karmon denied Labor claims that
Sephardic support for the Likud was weakening, but said Likud
leaders are not targeting thos voters in particular. ``Labor has to
do that because of the past, but we have nothing to apologize
for,'' she said.

   Wayland Flowers, a ventriloquist who brought
life to a cackling, off-color puppet named Madame, died Tuesday of
cancer. He was 48.
   Flowers created a cast of characters, but it was the craggy old
hussy Madame, manipulated with rods rather than strings, that
launched the popularity of the television and showroom act.
   Wayland & Madame's first big break came on ``The Andy Williams
Show'' and led to guest appearances on the reincarnated
``Laugh-In,'' ``Hollywood Squares'' and a four-year stint on
``Solid Gold.'' Their own syndicated situation comedy ``Madame's
Place'' was shown in 1982.
   Flowers also brought life to such characters as Crazy Marv, who
had terribly accurate observations on humanity, Jiffy from Harlem
with humor and song stylings, vaudevillian Mr. Mackelhoney and Baby
Smedley's high chair view of the world.

<HEAD>Duel of Liberace Movies Ends in a Draw</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS' saga about Liberace finished among last
week's top 15 prime-time TV shows and nearly matched the rating of
ABC's version broadcast the previous week.
   ABC's ``Liberace'' had a rating of 16.8 and ranked seventh. It
was the ``official'' version, sanctioned by the flamboyant
entertainer's estate.
   Perhaps viewers tuned in for CBS' ``Liberace: Behind the
Music,'' hoping for a more sensationalized account of his life. The
CBS movie had a rating of 16.6 and ranked 14th, according to the
A.C. Nielsen Co.
   NBC won a week it had expected to lose because of major league
baseball championship playoffs on ABC. A rainout of Friday's
National League game 3 lowered ABC's score in the Nielsens and gave
NBC the unexpected victory.
   For the week that ended Sunday, NBC had a 15.0 rating, ABC 13.4
and CBS 12.4.
   NBC added two new shows to the top 10, its premiere of ``Empty
Nest,'' nestled behind the hit ``Golden Girls'' on Saturday, and a
preview of ``Dear John'' in the NBC Thursday hit lineup. The season
premiere of ``The Cosby Show'' was No. 1, though it had a
considerably lower rating and share than its premiere last season _
24.2 and a 40 share, compared with 31.5 and 51 last year.
   Gerald Jaffe, NBC's vice president for research projects,
attributed the ``Cosby'' number to competition from baseball, but
said NBC had expected the show's ratings to slide in this, its
fifth season.
   The rest of last week's top 10 were: ``A Different World,''
``Golden Girls,'' ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear John,'' all NBC;
``Jesse,'' a CBS Tuesday movie; and tied at eighth: ``ALF,''
``Tonight Show 26th Anniversary'' and ``The Hogan Family'' on NBC,
plus CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ABC's ``Monday Night Football.''
   In news, the ``CBS Evening News'' won the week with a 10.2
rating and 20 share, though ABC's ``World News Tonight'' managed a
close second, 9.9 and 21, despite baseball pre-emptions. ``NBC
Nightly News'' had a 9.6 and 20 share.
   A rating point equals 904,000 homes with televisions. The share
is a percentage of sets in use.
   NBC's Olympics coverage sputtered to a close with the ``Summer
Olympics Review'' ranked 47th with an 8.7 rating and 14 share, just
above the 10 lowest-rated shows of the week: ``Incredible Sunday,''
``American League Championship Pre-game 3,'' ``National League
Championship Pre-game 3,'' ``Full House,'' ``Bugs Bunny Specials,''
``Cavanaughs,'' ``Perfect Strangers,'' ``Simon & Simon'' and
``Live! Dick Clark Presents.''

   The program would provide cash allowances equal to the amount

   A man who told police he had 8.5 kilograms
of cocaine in his car when they stopped him for a traffic violation
testified Tuesday he made $139,000 dealing drugs while posing as a
U.S. soldier in Panama.
   Jackie Lee Bigelow, dismissed from the Army in 1986, said he
made six trips to Panama in his old uniform between April 1987 and
last May. He testified he was paid $25,000 for each of five times
he flew back with duffle bags containing cocaine, which he then
took to apartments in New York City.
   He said he also was paid $13,000 for a cardboard box of cocaine
he mailed to a girlfriend and also got another $1,000 from a
contact in Panama.
   Bigelow's testimony came in the first day of the U.S. District
Court trial of four people accused in a smuggling ring that
included the alleged drug mailings.
   Bigelow, of Doerun, also was charged in the case but has pleaded
guilty.
   The case broke when Bigelow, 27, was stopped by police on May 28
for failing to have a driver's license. He told police he had 8.5
kilograms of cocaine in his car.
   On trial are Oscar Smith, Regina Smith and Julia Thom of New
York, and Gary King of Doerun. They are accused of smuggling up to
600 pounds of cocaine into the United States through various means.
   Defense lawyers have said that Bigelow has concocted his story
to win a lighter sentence for himself. But Bigelow testified that
King made two of the Panama trips with him, and that Smith was on
the receiving end of most of his visits to New York.

   A prosecution witness at the divorce-fixing
trial of former Miss America Bess Myerson conceded Tuesday that
both sides in her boyfriend's divorce case did favors for the
presiding judge's daughter.
   Miss Myerson, 64, the former city cultural affairs commissioner,
is accused of giving a city job to the daughter of former state
Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 75, in exchange for the
judge's favorable rulings in the divorce of Miss Myerson's lover,
Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43.
   The defense succeeded in getting Mrs. Gabel's former law clerk,
Howard Leventhal, to admit during cross examination that a lawyer
for Capasso's wife once helped secure an apartment for Mrs. Gabel's
daughter, although he did not remember exactly when.
   In earlier testimony, Leventhal said that Miss Myerson made
numerous phone calls to the judge's chambers while Mrs. Gabel was
deciding whether to cut Capasso's alimony payments to his estranged
wife.
   According to Leventhal, Mrs. Gabel apparently did not tell
lawyers in the Capasso divorce trial about the Myerson phone calls
when she offered to excuse herself from the case after a newspaper
article revealed that Miss Myerson had hired the judge's daughter,
Sukhreet.
   Miss Myerson is accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job to
Sukhreet Gabel, who was then 34, shortly after Miss Myerson became
cultural affairs commissioner in 1983 in order to get the judge to
reduce Capasso's temporary support payments.
   Mrs. Gabel also did not tell the lawyers that Mrs. Capasso's
lawyer, Raoul Felder, helped Sukhreet Gabel obtain an apartment,
Leventhal testified under questioning by the judge's defense
attorney, Michael Feldberg.
   Felder is not accused of any wrongdoing.
   In cross examining Leventhal, the defense sought to explain or
defuse his apparently damaging testimony that Mrs. Gabel deviated
from her usual routine in handling the Capasso case.
   On Sept. 14, 1983, Mrs. Gabel cut Capasso's weekly temporary
alimony and child support payments from $1,850 to $680 a week. Her
ruling came just a few weeks after Sukhreet Gabel got a job as Miss
Myerson's assistant.

   In a gesture cheered by environmentalists, the
operator of a Connecticut power plant has agreed to chip in on a
tree-growing project it says will indirectly offset its boilers'
addition to the ``greenhouse'' warming of the Earth.
   The company, Applied Energy Services, said Tuesday it will give
$2 million to an international effort to plant 52 million trees on
385 square miles in Guatemala.
   The trees should absorb enough carbon dioxide to offset the 1.4
million tons that the company's 180-megawatt coal-fired plant in
Uncasville, Conn., will generate each year during its 40-year life,
according to the company's calculations.
   The Arlington, Va.-based company said that as an environmental
rule of thumb, two square miles of forest are needed for every
megawatt of coal-fired plant capacity.
   Environmentalists hailed the company's move, saying it helped
illustrate the international nature of the greenhouse effect, a
warming of the Earth that scientists say appears to have begun due
to increasing carbon dioxide and other chemicals released into the
air. Carbon dioxide is formed by fossil fuel combust ion.
   The warming could mean an average temperature increase of 3 to 8
degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, an increase
in sea levels of a foot or more and widespread weather changes that
could mean more frequent droughts in the center of North America,
scientists say.
   Worldwide, some 20 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year are
released into the atmosphere.
   Gus Speth, president of the World Resources Institute that
helped organize the Guatemala project, called the Applied Energy
action ``one of the most far-sighted and socially responsible
decisions that any company has ever made.''
   Requiring plant operators to offset their emissions in some
similar manner ``might be proposed someday'' in legislation, he
said.
   Michael Oppenheimer, atmospheric physicist with the
Environmental Defense Fund in New York, said a colleague, Dan
Dudek, had recently proposed payments from utilities to plant trees
on land taken out of agricultural production in the United States.
   Other environmentalists were quick to praise the Applied Energy
decision.
   ``I like it,'' said Neil Simpson, executive vice president of
the American Forestry Association, which is planning a
tree-planting campaign of its own. ``It recognizes we're in one
world, when you've got a Connecticut company going to Guatemala to
plant trees.''
   Roger Sant, chief executive officer of Applied Energy, said he
hoped the project would prove ``a useful mitigation strategy'' for
all new coal-fired electric generation capacity.
   ``We don't yet know that this is going to work perfectly,'' but
if it does ``we're looking to follow the same strategy at our other
plants,'' Sant said.
   Applied Energy is one of the new independent producers selling
power under contract to utilities, escaping tight state regulation
for generally looser federal supervision. The company operates
three plants totaling 360 megawatts and has contracts to build
1,600 megawatts of generating capacity.
   When the Uncasville plant is completed, it will sell power to
Connecticut Light & Power Co.
   Applied Energy's cash for the Guatemala project will be matched
by cash or services totaling $2 million from CARE, $1.2 million
from the government of Guatemala, $3.6 million from the Agency for
International Development and $7.5 million from the Peace Corps.
CARE, an international development organization based in New York,
will handle the company's contribution.

   The Reagan administration is expressing strong
support for the efforts of former Cambodian leader Norodom Sihanouk
to achieve national reconciliation in his homeland and says
``effective safeguards'' must be imposed to prevent a return to
power by the Khmer Rouge.
   Sihanouk, who was meeting today with Secretary of State George
P. Shultz, said Tuesday after a visit with President Reagan he
agrees that leaders of the Khmer Rouge ``must go into exile, if
possible,'' as part of a post-settlement coalition government.
   The Khmer Rouge are believed to have killed between 1 million
and 2 million Cambodians during their 3{ years in power during the
late 1970s. They are one of three rebel groups fighting the
Vietnamese-backed government now in power in Phnom Penh.
   The Reagan administration is providing $5 million in non-lethal
assistance to the two anti-communist rebel groups and is consulting
with members of Congress about the possibility of an increase.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan told
Sihanouk that he ``supported (Sihanouk's) efforts to establish a
reconciliation government in Cambodia.''
   ``He said our policy rests on two elements, a complete
Vietnamese withdrawal and no return to power of the Khmer Rouge,''
Fitzwater said.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said China,
which has been a major backer of the Khmer Rouge, recognizes that
``discredited'' leaders of that group, such as Pol Pot, cannot be
permitted to play a role in a future Cambodian government.
   But she said the administration could not confirm a New York
Times report that China has offered political asylum to individual
Khmer Rouge leaders.
   There have been intensified diplomatic efforts to shape events
in Cambodia as Vietnam has begun a drawdown of its troops in that
country, setting a 1990 deadline for a complete withdrawal.
   Sihanouk, who was ousted as head of state in 1970 and heads a
rebel faction active in Cambodia, met with Undersecretary of State
Michael Armacost after his visit to the White House.
   Aligning himself with the Reagan administration, Sihanouk told
reporters it is ``necessary to give the world some guarantee about
the Khmer Rouge in the future.''
   Mrs. Oakley said the discussion with Sihanouk focused on ways to
achieve a negotiated settlement that includes the complete
withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and effective safeguards against a
Khmer Rouge return to power.
   The Khmer Rouge is said to be the strongest of the three
factions and a major international effort is under way to ensure
that group does not play a dominant role in Cambodia's future
political evolution.
   Particularly active in this effort have been the six members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) _ Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Brunei.
   One of the measures being discussed to limit the Khmer Rouge
role is the establishment of an international peacekeeping force.
Other measures under discussion include the disarming of all
Cambodian factions and removing leading Khmer Rouge figures from
Cambodia.
   Mrs. Oakley gave a strong endorsement of Sihanouk, calling him a
``leading symbol of Cambodian nationalism for the past 40 years.''
   ``We believe that his role is central to a satisfactory
settlement in Cambodia and we welcome the opportunity of his visit
to express our strong support for him,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Ancient alchemists, who strived to convert
base metals into gold, have been outdone. A modern-day chemist is
changing sewer gas into diamonds.
   Dr. James E. Butler and his colleagues at the Naval Research
Laboratory won't likely be going into the fancy jewelry business,
he admits.
   But they have found a way to produce some tiny industrial-type
diamond crystals using one of the most widely available raw
materials, the methane from sewer gas.
   In this case, gas from Washington's Blue Plains Waste Water
Treatment Plant, which is adjacent to the research laboratory.
   In addition, other chemists working at the Naval Research
Laboratory have grown diamond crystals using an oxygen-acetylene
torch, Butler said.
   ``I don't think we'll be able to grow gemstone size and quality
diamonds in the near future,'' Butler cautioned.
   But the tiny diamonds made in his process _ using chemical
vapors to deposit crystals on a surface _ could have a variety of
industrial applications from abrasives to protective coatings,
computer insulators and a host of other uses, he said.
   What Butler and the other Navy scientists are doing is
developing methods of getting carbon to form diamond crystals.
Their process requires heating chemical vapors at normal air
pressure or less and then getting carbon from the vapor to
crystalize on a surface at temperatures of about 900 degrees
Celsius (1,440 degrees Fahrenheit). Current industrial processes
for making diamonds require much higher heat and pressure.
   Graphite _ the soft black material used in pencil leads _ is the
normally stable form of carbon at room temperature, Butler
explained.
   But by heating carbon-containing gases like sewer gas or
acetylene the harder form of carbon can be made to grow on a
surface. And if enough crystals form they combine into a thin
diamond film, Butler added.
   Why use sewer gas?
   ``Sewer gas was just a case of having a convenient, inexpensive
source of methane,'' Butler said. Methane, a combination of carbon
and hydrogen, is a primary constituent of sewer gas. It is
generally burned as waste.
   Researchers in other countries have performed some similar
experiments, Butler said, adding that such sources of carbon as
vodka also have been used.
   It will be years before the diamond-making system could be
developed on an industrial scale, he said, but when that happens
plenty of raw material will be available.
   And if burning of the waste gas is halted that also would reduce
pollution and release of carbon dioxide, a product of the burning
which scientsts fear will add to the so-called greenhouse warming
of the Earth.

<HEAD>Meetings This Week on US-Soviet Grain Pact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another meeting is scheduled for this week in
London to see if a new long-term U.S.-Soviet grain agreement can be
worked out.
   The meeting was announced Tuesday by the White House as
``tentatively scheduled'' for Thursday and Friday, but no other
details were provided in the brief statement by Alan F. Holmer,
deputy trade representative, who leads U.S. negotiators.
   The previous 5-year agreement expired on Sept. 30, despite
months of negotiations and informal talks by U.S. and Soviet
officials. One possibility has been a simple extension of the old
pact for a year while negotiators work out details of a new
arrangement.
   Negotiators have been pressured by some U.S. farm interests to
insist on larger minimum levels of annual grain purchases by the
Soviet Union.
   Meanwhile, the Soviets have been buying U.S. grain in large
quantities without a new agreement, including an additional 250,000
metric tons announced Tuesday by the Agriculture Department.
   The sale brought total corn sold to the Soviets and delivered in
the 1988-89 corn marketing year that began on Sept. 1 to more than
4.3 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 250,000 tons of
corn would be about 9.85 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.73 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $27 million.
   According to the old agreement, the annual purchases were
supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets had the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   Prior to the round of sales announced since Sept. 1, the Soviet
Union had purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million
tons of corn for delivery in the fifth year and final year of the
agreement, plus 830,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of
soybean meal.

   Last weekend's meat loaf might still taste
good tonight with the addition of a substance from the shells of
crabs and lobsters, according to Agriculture Department scientists.
   John R. Vercelloti, a chemist at the department's Southern
Regional Research Center in New Orleans, said the substance, called
chitin, inhibits a warmed-over flavor in uncured meat, poultry or
fish that is cooked, stored and reheated.
   The additives have shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the
off-taste for up to five days when mixed with hamburger, he said.
   Vercellotti, in a report issued Tuesday by the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said TV dinners, microwave foods and
leftovers are prime candidates for off-tastes. Meats cured with
nitrite, such as bacon, ham and lunch meats don't have such
problems, he said.
   The warmed-over flavor also is described by the food industry as
``cardboardy'' or ``painty.'' The off-taste is caused when fat in
the uncured meat breaks down as it is reheated.
   Vercellotti and a fellow chemist, Allen J. St. Angelo, are
seeking a patent on additives made from chitin, which he described
as ``a surplus material from the shellfish industry.'' Chitin is
most commonly found in the shells of lobsters, crabs and other
shellfish.
   The warmed-over flavor occurs when oxygen in the atmosphere
breaks down fats in the meat, the report said. Large amounts of
iron present in meat speed up the oxidation.
   But the chitin additives bind the iron so it cannot speed up the
oxidation, thus slowing down the development of the warmed-over
flavor.
   Chitin additives would have to be approved by the Food and Drug
Administration before being available to consumers.
   ``Basically they are a type of soluble dietary fiber that we
think will be safe to use in foods,'' Vercellotti said. ``We've
only tested chitin additives on beef, but we think they will work
on other meats, poultry and fish as well.''
   The laboratory studies show that the additives ``have no other
effect on meat flavor,'' he said. ``We're only talking about adding
a few parts per million to the meat.''
   Vercellotti said the compounds can be mixed into the meat,
rolled on to the meat surface or sprayed on as a liquid.

<HEAD>Labor Costs In Europe Now Higher Than In US</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The labor-cost advantage that West European
factory owners held over their American counterparts as recently as
two years ago is shrinking, according to a government report.
   A Bureau of Labor Statistics report Tuesday said labor costs
measured in dollar terms were higher in eight West European
countries in 1987 than in the United States.
   The average hourly cost in this country was $13.44 last year. In
Norway it was $17.39, in Switzerland $17.14; in West Germany
$16.87; in the Netherlands $15.46; in Sweden $15.12; in Belgium
$15.02; in Denmark $14.56 and in Finland $13.52.
   For the first time since 1980, the West European average was
higher than that of America.
   In 1986, the only European countries that paid more for their
labor than the United States were Switzerland, Norway and West
Germany.
   The lower cost of U.S. labor was due in large part to the drop
in the value of the dollar compared with most other currencies.
   The labor costs as measured by the bureau included employer-paid
taxes such as social security payments, as well as spending on
private benefit plans and the actual money that employees find in
their pay envelopes.
   Since labor costs often determine where a manufacturer will
produce goods and what the price will be, lower U.S. labor costs
help make American goods cheaper and more attractive on world
markets.
   The bureau survey measured labor costs in 26 countries around
the globe. The average for those countries was 76 percent of the
U.S. pay rate. That was 10 percentage points higher than in 1986
and 6 points above the previous peak in 1980 when the dollar was at
a low point.
   Japan accounted for a good deal of the overall rise in labor
costs. In 1975 its labor cost was $3.05 an hour, less than half the
U.S. rate. In 1986 it was $9.47. In 1987 it was $11.14, well above
Britain's $8.96, close to Canada's $11.97 and 83 percent of the
cost in the United States.
   Japan has been losing some of its own manufacturing to the
``tigers,'' the rapidly industrializing countries of East Asia,
where costs are still low though they have been rising even faster
than in Japan. South Korean factories still had to spend only $1.79
an hour last year, but that was a big jump from 35 cents in 1975.
   Labor costs in Latin America are lower. In Brazil they were only
$1.49 an hour, a drop from the $1.60 of 1986. In Mexico they were
$1.57, less than half the $3.71 rate of 1981, when the Mexican peso
was worth a lot more than it is today.

<HEAD>Lawyers: North Didn't Know Lying to Congress Was a Crime</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers say Oliver L. North cannot be
prosecuted for lying to Congress because the former presidential
aide was never warned that making misleading statements about
covert operations was a crime.
   Citing false statements by government officials about other
covert operations, North's defense lawyers contended Tuesday that
Iran-Contra prosecutors were bringing novel charges against their
client.
   The defense said that until North's indictment March 16 with
three other Iran-Contra defendants, ``no executive branch official
had ever been prosecuted based on unsworn statements to Congress.''
   North did not receive a ``fair warning that an executive branch
official or a member of his staff would be guilty of a crime if the
truth were misstated in an unsworn communication to Congress,'' the
defense said.
   The defense filed a series of motions to dismiss various charges
that North, a former National Security Council aide, misled House
committees in 1985 and 1986 by denying involvement in efforts to
arm the Contras or raise money for the rebels fighting Nicaragua's
Sandinista government.
   The defense noted that none of the statements made by North were
under oath, including remarks he made during an ``informal
off-the-record discussion'' with members of the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence in 1986 in the White House
Situation Room.
   The other statements were written responses to queries made by
various House committees about reports of covert assistance to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   An indictment returned last March charges North, former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim
and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord with conspiring
to defraud the government by diverting U.S.-Iran arms sale profits
to the Contras.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has ordered separate
trials for each defendant. North is set to be tried first, but no
date has been set for the trial.
   North's lawyers noted there was no prosecution of Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles for falsely assuring lawmakers in 1958
that the government was not intervening in Indonesia even though
the CIA was supporting rebels fighting President Sukarno.
   Likewise, the defense said, there were no prosecutions arising
from false statements by the State Department after a U-2 spy plane
was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960, the defense noted.
   There may be disagreement ``as to whether or to what extent it
is proper for government officials to misstate or conceal the truth
where a truthful statement would jeopardize intelligence gathering
or covert operations or otherwise compromise national security,''
North's lawyers said.
   ``Until this case, however, there was no notion that such a
false or misleading statement could be criminal simply because the
statement was made directly or indirectly to a member of
Congress,'' the defense said.
   ``The executive branch communicates with Congress on a continual
basis about countless matters relating to the business of
government,'' the defense said.
   North's lawyers said the provision under which he was charged
only applied to statements made in connection with Congress'
administrative functions and ``could not have been intended to
reach such communications.''
   If it were applicable, ``it would allow prosecution of executive
branch officials for misrepresenting their intentions or concealing
material facts,'' defense lawyers said.

   A demonstration that temporarily closed Food
and Drug Administration headquarters underscores the desperation of
AIDS sufferers hoping for a chemical cure that so far has escaped
researchers around the world.
   The action Tuesday at FDA's headquarters building in nearby
Rockville, Md., also highlighted a fundamental problem facing the
agency charged by law with overseeing the safety and effectiveness
of its drugs.
   In essence, the hundreds of demonstrators _ including more than
100 arrested for blocking entrances to the building _ are asking
the agency to recommend experimental AIDS treatments as soon as it
determines they are no more dangerous than AIDS itself.
   The agency says that to do that would eliminate a major reason
for its existence: to apply a scientific sorting process that tries
to cull quackery from treatments proven safe and effective.
   The key word is proven. AIDS patients feel they don't have time
to wait for proof.
   ``I would rather take my chances with the side effects of an
experimental drug,'' said Vito Russo, a New York City writer who
says he was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985. ``The side effect of AIDS
is death.''
   At the same time, Russo complained that officials in the Reagan
administration are using the highly vocal call for easier approval
of AIDS drugs to bolster its general theme of less government
regulation _ in this case of pharmaceutical companies.
   Russo said he and his fellow demonstrators do not want the FDA
to stop testing drugs. They want the agency to test them faster.
   Ironically, that argument was heard loudest from pharmaceutical
companies until the issue of AIDS drugs attained such a high
profile.
   But such an argument coming from an individual suffering from an
incurable illness casts the issue onto a moral and ethical plane _
and, on Tuesday, into the streets.
   There is an inherent ethical judgment in almost all FDA
decisions on new drugs: whether the beneficial effect warrants
potentially harmful side effects. But the issue is seldom drawn
sharply enough to provoke protests by the people most directly
affected _ the patients.
   With no easy answers in sight, the private American Foundation
for AIDS Research Foundation publishes an AIDS experimental
treatment directory that is updated quarterly.
   The latest edition, issued just over three weeks ago, lists 97
drugs and agents being investigated as possible treatments for AIDS
and AIDS-related illnesses with the names and addresses of the
researchers conducting trials on each.
   The 128-page book _ free to AIDS patients _ starts with the
``strong recommendation'' that any person considering experimental
treatment ``obtain the guidance of a personal physician in making
any and all decisions in this area.''
   In a note to those infected with HIV _ the AIDS-causing virus _
the booklet recommends reading established medical journals that
report on AIDS research.
   ``But do not be fooled into thinking you can be your own doctor
after reading a selection of articles,'' it cautions.
   The booklet's last advice says that while ``there is no such
thing as the Official Guide to Coping with Serious Illness ...
there is something very real that is known as `the will to live.'
It cannot be found in a test-tube or under a microscope. Every
person must discover it for himself. If you have it or can find it,
it can make a difference.''
   Vito Russo has been living with AIDS for more than three years,
longer than most who contract the disease. He is determined to
live. And when all else is said and done, whether their position is
right or wrong, that is why Russo and hundreds of fellow
demonstrators shut the doors of the FDA for a few hours on a chilly
October day.

<HEAD>House, Senate Try to Meld Differing Tax Bills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Negotiators are trying to reach a compromise
on sharply differing tax bills passed by the House and Senate, one
containing a ``taxpayers' bill of rights'' and the other offering
relief for 20 million owners of mutual funds.
   The Senate bill, which was approved Tuesday night on an 87-1
vote, would cut selected taxes by an estimated $3 billion over
three years and, to avoid worsening the deficit, boost other taxes
by the same amount. The House bill, passed 380-25 on Aug. 4, has a
$7.5 billion price tag.
   Far more provisions are identical in both bills. Both would
correct hundreds of technical errors in the 1986 tax overhaul;
extend several expiring tax benefits; relieve farmers from paying
the federal diesel tax on fuel for off-road use, and raise some
taxes to pay for the benefits.
   The tax bill and a comprehensive plan for fighting drug abuse
are the only major pieces of legislation standing in the way of
adjournment of the 100th Congress, as early as this weekend.
   ``All of us realize the more revenue we have in this bill, the
less likely the president is to sign it,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., manager of the Senate tax measure. Thus, the Senate will
try to hold down the cost and House negotiators will be pushing for
senators to accept some new provisions.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., cast the only vote against the Senate
bill. A principal architect of the 1986 tax changes, Bradley has
argued against undue tampering with the new system, saying it
should not be riddled with special-interest provisions.
   Not voting on the 87-1 Senate vote that passed the tax bill
were: Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; David Boren, D-Okla.; Lawton
Chiles, D-Fla.; Thad Cochran, R-Miss.; Daniel Evans, R-Wash.; Phil
Gramm, R-Texas; David Karnes, R-Neb.; Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.;
Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; Dan Quayle, R-Ind.; Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.,
and Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   Both the House and Senate bills would extend several expiring
tax benefits, with the Senate opting for a shorter extension in
order to reduce the cost. These include a credit for business
research, an exclusion for workers' employer-financed educational
assistance, and a tax break for low-income first-time home buyers.
   The Senate bill, but not the House, would set up a ``bill of
rights'' for taxpayers who are the subject of collection or other
enforcement efforts by the IRS.
   The agency would have to inform taxpayers fully of their rights
at the time an action is launched and would be barred from
promoting employees on the basis of how much they collect. The
10-day notice required before the IRS could seize property for
overdue taxes would be extended to 30 days.
   The House bill includes a permanent change for owners of
mutual-fund shares, allowing them to deduct as a miscellaneous
expense certain costs of operating the funds. These expenses could
be written off fully despite a 1986 change that permits
miscellaneous deductions only to the extent they exceed 2 percent
of adjusted gross income.
   Other Senate provisions would:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Allow families to avoid tax on interest earnehe diesel tax on fuel
used for off-road purposes. They now must
pay and later file for a refund. This also is in the House bill.
   _Permit freelance writers, photographers and artists to deduct
expenses of a project even before it begins producing income; also
in the House bill.
   _Allow livestock farmers to deduct expenses of producing an
animal even before it became productive; this would wipe out what
has become known as the ``heifer tax.'' This is in the House bill.
   _Allow a medical-expense deduction for costs of making a home
safe from radon gas.
   _Extend authority to issue tax-exempt bonds to benefit
lower-income first-time home buyers through June 1989. The House
approved a longer extension.
   _Renew through 1988 a tax exclusion for employer-paid
educational assistance; most graduate study would not qualify. An
exclusion for legal services also would be extended. The House
agreed.
   _Extend through next March 31 a credit for increased spending
for research; the House voted a longer extension.
   _Renew a tax break for healthy savings and loan associations
that take over failing associations, and extend the benefit to
banks.
   _Permit use of tax-exempt bonds to finance certain high-speed
rail facilities.
   _Allow farmers who are forced by drought to sell draft,
sporting, dairy or breeding livestock to delay tax on such income
for a year. The bill would ensure that drought disaster payments
for crops are not taxable in 1988.
   _Make it more difficult to avoid taxes on investment in
single-premium life insurance policies whose cash value builds at a
faster rate than one whose premiums are paid in seven equal
installments. This also is in the House bill.
   _Require certain corporations that have underpaid estimated
taxes to pay all the shortages in the next quarter; also in the
House bill.
   _Allow an 80 percent deduction for contributions to college
athletic scholarship funds even when such gifts guarantee a fan the
privilege of buying a game ticket.
   _Permit rural letter carriers to deduct 33.75 cents for each
mile they use a personal car on their route; that is 150 percent
the usual rate; also in the House bill.
   _Gradually repeal a 1986 provision, which lawmakers say has been
badly abused, that allowed corporations controlled by Alaska
natives to sell their tax losses. The House approved a quicker
repeal.
   _Require federal purchase of 540 acres of land 30 miles west of
Washington at the site of the Second Battle of Manassas to block
construction of a shopping mall.

<HEAD>Plutonium Shipment Plans Questioned; Japan May Provide Armed
Escort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan is opting to ship deadly plutonium for
its nuclear reactors by sea rather than by air, prompting
complaints from some members of Congress that the United States
should have been consulted.
   U.S. and Japanese officials disclosed the shipping plans on
Tuesday, touching off the dispute.
   Two Democratic lawmakers said Congress was tricked out of its
right to a reasonable period to review changes in the new 30-year
U.S.-Japan nuclear cooperation agreement.
   The State Department denied the assertion, saying the new pact,
which went into effect last July, allowed certain changes with 15
days' notice to Congress.
   The change provides for a temporary alternative of sea shipment
until crash-proof air shipment casks are developed. State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told reporters that Congress
was notified formally on Sept. 20.
   Japan has been purchasing spent uranium atomic fuel from the
United States and sending it to Europe for refining into plutonium
before it reaches Japan. The United States seeks to retain control
over usage because plutonium is highly radioactive and usable not
only for fueling power reactors but also for nuclear weapons.
   In authorizing ocean shipments to Japan, the latest arrangement
requires that armed escorts be provided against potential terrorist
seizure.
   It defines the escort ``as a coast guard or maritime safety
vessel or any other ship on government service that is authorized
and fully capable of protecting the transport ship and cargo and
deterring acts of sabotage,'' said Richard J. Stratford, deputy
assistant secretary of state for nuclear energy and technology.
   He said the Japanese were told they could request U.S. escorts
but that they would be supplied only if consistent with overall
U.S. security priorities. The Japanese then ``indicated they were
considering providing the escort themselves,'' he said.
   Recalling testimony a year ago that air was preferable to sea
shipment, Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., said the Reagan
administration ``is trying to sneak by a hurried Congress a very
dangerous change in policy. The administration is playing
hide-and-seek with disaster by not guaranteeing the adequate safety
of sea shipments to Japan.''
   He said the administration ``has signed off on a 30-year
approval for shipment of the most dangerous substance known to man
and left Congress only 15 days to respond.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, also complained, saying that in
addition to opening a threat of nuclear blackmail by terrorists,
sea shipment increases chances of contaminating drinking water with
radioactivity.
   Another State Department spokeswoman, Nancy Beck, quoted the
Defense Department as saying air shipment was preferable but that
sea shipment was acceptable under proper safeguards, that hijacking
a plutonium-carrying ship was a task for ``a major naval power,''
and that the Pentagon was satisfied with the safeguards provided in
the latest arrangement with Japan.

   Bernard Shaw of Cable News Network will
moderate Thursday night's prime time debate between George Bush and
Michael Dukakis, with representatives of ABC, NBC and Newsweek
magazine serving as panelists.
   The sponsoring Commission on Presidential Debates said Tuesday
that Andrea Mitchell of NBC, Ann Compton of ABC and Margaret Warner
of Newsweek would pose the questions to the candidates during the
90-minute exchange in Los Angeles.
   The second and final debate between Bush and Dukakis will begin
at 9 p.m. EDT Thursday in Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus,
barring a rainout that delays the conclusion of the National League
baseball playoffs.
   The announcement came after CBS anchorman Dan Rather said he had
declined an invitation to be a panelist. Rather said the format
agreed to by the two campaigns was ``not the best'' and added he
would rather report on the event than participate in it.
   In a reverse of the first debate, the first question will go to
Dukakis, and Bush will have the final closing statement, according
to Bob Neuman, spokesman for the commission.

<HEAD>Gallup Poll: Bush 49, Dukakis 43</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush held a 49-43 lead over Michael
Dukakis in a national survey of registered voters conducted by the
Gallup Organization, which also found equal numbers of respondents
calling themselves Republicans and Democrats.
   The organization polled 1,007 registered voters Friday through
Sunday. Because of a four-point margin of error, the two
presidential candidates were statistically tied.
   Other national polls also have found Bush retaining a small
numerical lead, indicating that he is slightly ahead.
   Most other recent polls have been conducted among registered
voters who are judged as likely to turn out. Gallup, applying a
relatively loose gauge of likely voters, found Bush leading by
52-41 in that group of 748.
   Gallup stressed the closer result in its analysis of the survey,
released Tuesday, saying it believed it was too soon to gauge
likelihood of voting.
   That bigger Bush lead could stem from his greater support among
better educated voters, who generally are more likely to vote. He
was backed by 58 percent of college-educated respondents, compared
with 37 percent of those who have not finished high school.
   Also, the Gallup poll found about as many respondents calling
themselves Republicans as Democrats, a result matched in some but
not all other polls. In past years, the Democrats have held a clear
edge.
   As in other polls, the Democratic vice presidential nominee,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, was seen as having decisively beaten his
Republican counterpart, Sen. Dan Quayle, in their debate last week.
   Just less than half rated Quayle as qualified to serve as
president if necessary, but that was up from about a third before
the debate. Seventy-six percent called Bentsen qualified, up from
68 percent.
   Gallup sought to ascertain the effect of doubts about Quayle by
isolating the respondents who saw no difference between Bush and
Dukakis but did see a difference between Quayle and Bentsen. They
made up 9 percent of the total, were mostly Democratic and went for
Dukakis by a 2-1 margin.

   When Lloyd Bentsen picked up an AR-15 assault
rifle at a police practice range in eastern Pennsylvania and
brought the weapon to his shoulder, he was aiming all the same for
Texas votes.
   The Democratic vice presidential candidate's three shots Tuesday
hit just below the silhouette target's heart. Democrats in Texas
are hoping that on Nov. 8 he can hit an electoral bull's eye.
   After weeks of taking a drubbing, Bentsen's strong showing
against Dan Quayle in their debate has sparked new optimism and a
new offensive by the Texas Democrats.
   ``It was viewed as a slam dunk in Texas, and there's obviously a
lot of regional pride,'' said Joe O'Neill, Bentsen's chief of
staff. ``The mentality of the political guys down in the state has
changed dramatically over the past week.''
   O'Neill, Bentsen's top campaign aide, seems to spend as much
time in touch with the senator's Texas organization as he does with
the Democratic campaign's Boston headquarters.
   After all, winning Texas' 29 electoral votes _ third largest
prize in the nation _ was the main reason Bentsen was picked for
the ballot by Michael Dukakis. And he's turned what was expected to
be a GOP blowout into a horserace.
   But so far the polls show he's not winning it.
   Published surveys put the Democrats behind by five to 12 points.
Tom Cosgrove, director of the Dukakis-Bentsen Texas campaign, says
the Democrats' post-debate polling showed the gap near the small
end of that range, while Republicans privately say their data still
show a double-digit lead for George Bush and strong anti-Dukakis
sentiment.
   ``We feel good,'' says Reggie Basher, spokesman for Bush's Texas
campaign. Not only are the polls in Bush's favor, he says, but the
Republicans have a strong organization in the state that Bush also
calls home.
   The task for Bentsen clearly is to convince Texans that Dukakis
would be good for their economy and trustworthy on gut issues such
as crime and gun control _ issues the Bush campaign has used to
clobber the Democrats.
   After he picked up that rifle at the police academy in
Allentown, Pa., Bentsen spoke on how the Democrats were tough on
crime, despite Republican claims to the contrary.
   The image of the vice presidential candidate so armed delivered
the other message: If Dukakis is some kind of anti-gun nut, as the
the Republicans make him out to be, would he have a man on the
ticket like Bentsen who owns many firearms and uses them with
expert flair?
   The campaign is complementing its symbolism with an aggressive
new advertising campaign in the state.
   ``We've just begun to launch our attack, when Texas voters are
paying attention,'' said Cosgrove, a non-Texan who refuses to
accept criticism from state Democrats, including Bentsen, that the
campaign didn't respond quickly enough to the GOP onslaught.
   ``We're a patient campaign,'' Cosgrove said this week. ``This is
Monday, Oct. 10, not Monday, Nov. 7,'' he said this week.
   On the heels of Bentsen's debate, Democrats in the past week
have launched a new television and radio blitz. While Bush has
attacked Dukakis for a prison furlough program and favoring gun
control, the ads say Bush has supported the same things.
   A direct mail campaign lampoons Bush's visits to flag factories.
It features flags of other nations that are doing well under a
Republican administration _ such as drug-exporting countries, the
Iranians who traded hostages for arms, and Japan, with its trade
dominance of the U.S.
   Bentsen has maintained his home state popularity despite being
tied to Dukakis, who is more liberal than most Texas politicians.
Trying to rub some of that approval off on Dukakis, Bentsen flew to
Lone Star, Texas, the day after his Omaha debate for a joint rally
with Dukakis, and he'll be there this week to watch on television
as Dukakis debates Bush.
   And he'll be back.

   Andy is a 2-year-old with a new pair of
shoes. Nothing unusual about that, except that Andy is a goose.
   Andy, owned by Gene Fleming of Hastings, was born without feet
and has legs that end in stumps just below the ankle.
   ``He had to balance himself like a child on stilts,'' Fleming
said.
   Until recently, Andy's legs weren't big enough to support shoes.
Fleming bought leather shoes _ size 0 _ for Andy.
   Now, the goose can walk, run and swim.
   ``Those shoes gave him a whole new lease on life,'' Fleming
said. ``Now he can outswim the other geese.''
   Fleming said the idea for shoes came easily, but that keeping
the shoes on a goose was another matter.
   He modified the shoes, putting foam rubber in the end for
comfort and to keep them from turning around. He also had to glue
the bows to the shoe because Andy kept untying the laces. Small
holes in the bottom of each shoe allows water to drain so the
leather won't freeze in winter.
   ``He just loves 'em,'' Fleming said. ``He doesn't try to kick
them off any more. He used to think he had mud on his feet and kept
kicking backward. Now he's got a big smile on his face.''

<TEXT>
   Congress is seeking a last-minute compromise
as it tries a final time to agree on a package of sanctions against
Iraq for its alleged use of poison gas against Kurds.
   House and Senate negotiators are considering a Senate-passed tax
bill which includes the anti-Iraq provision. The bill is one of the
final items on the congressional agenda before the legislators
adjourn for the year.
   The sanctions package was approved by the Senate, 87-0, as an
amendment Tuesday evening, shortly before the entire bill was
passed, 87-1.
   It was third time in two months the Senate has voted on the
issue, following reports that the Iraqi army used chemical arms in
late August to put down Kurdish rebels.
   ``The world cannot stand by in the face of repeated use of
poison gas by Iraq,'' said Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.
   The measure, less sweeping than the sanctions package adopted by
the Senate a month ago, is similar to a plan already approved by
the House.
   The bill would ban the export to Iraq of U.S. munitions and some
high technology items, and require America to oppose loans to Iraq
by international financial institutions such as the World Bank.
   In addition, President Reagan would have to levy more sanctions
by Dec. 31 unless Iraq provides verifiable assurances that it won't
against use chemical weapons. Those potential sanctions include
denial of export-import credits and downgrading diplomatic
relations.
   But the bill wouldn't restrict grain exports or halt Iraqi
attempts to get monetary credits to buy U.S. agricultural products.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., reflecting the worries of farm state
legislators, said, ``The concern is that this not lead to an
embargo on agricultural exports to Iraq.''
   But Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., complained that the measure unfairly
penalized U.S. manufacturers.
   ``They're probably laughing at us in Iraq right now,'' Heinz
said, declaring that the bill would not cut off the export to Iraq
of the equipment and chemicals needed to produce such chemical
weapons as mustard gas and nerve gas.

   A 12-year-old boy is the 11th Israeli to
contact polio since an outbreak began last month, and health
officials said an inadequate sewer system was contributing to the
spread of the disease.
   The Health Ministry last week ordered a nationwide vaccination
campaign after the polio virus was found in sewage in at least a
dozen Israeli cities.
   On Tuesday, the third day of the campaign, the government began
vaccinating about 1 million school children against the paralyzing
disease.
   Since September, there have been 11 confirmed cases of the
disease and six suspected cases. But Health Ministry officials
insisted the outbreak has not become an epidemic.
   ``We wouldn't be vaccinating the whole population if we didn't
think the whole population could be at risk. But this absolutely is
not an epidemic,'' said Paul Slater, chief epidemologist for the
Health Ministry.
   He said the latest case, the first confirmed since Sept. 12, was
reported in the town of Hadera, about 30 miles north of Tel Aviv.
The outbreak began in Hadera and most of the cases have been
reported there.
   Doctors believe the boy contracted the disease from an infected
person, not from contaminated sewage, Slater said.
   But Avraham Morag, chairman of the ministry's committee on
infectious diseases, said sewage has contributed to the spread of
the virus in some parts of the country.
   The former head of Israel's sewage system, Avraham Meir, told
Israeli radio that the nation's sewer system must be improved as
soon as possible.
   ``We have to tell the truth, purification centers are not
creating sterile surroundings,'' Meir said on the radio. ``But I'm
against scaring the public and saying, like I heard a child say:
`When I drink water I drink polio.'''
   In Tel Aviv, authorities closed two beaches amid fears that
overflowing sewage could contaminate the water with the virus.
   A spokesman said no trace of the polio virus had been found in
the water but city officials decided to close the beaches as a
precaution.
   At vaccination centers across the country, school children
received drops of the Sabin vaccine on their tongue. In some areas,
nurses went to schools and administered the vaccines in classrooms.
   Ministry officials expect to finish vaccinating school children
today and are now preparing doses of the vaccine for adults.
   More than 3 million people under the age of 40 will be
vaccinated in the next three weeks at a cost of about $2.5 million.

<HEAD>Colombian Government Cancels Use of Glyphosphate Against Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's Ministry of Justice has
canceled plans to use chemical spraying against marijuana and coca
plants because of a peasant protest, Justice Minister Guillermo
Plazas Acid said.
   Colombia's National Dangerous Drugs Board had planned to spray
1,760 acres of marijuana and coca plants with the herbicide
glyphosphate in southwest Colombia.
   About 2,000 peasants marched on the town of Corinto, took over
the town and kidnapped a newspaper reporter and two television
reporters last Saturday.
   The reporters, all Colombians, were released after a government
commission arrived in Corinto, 190 miles southwest of the capital
of Bogota, to talk with the peasants.
   ``The plants will be destroyed by hand, without using chemical
products,'' the justice minister said at a news conference Tuesday.
   The minister said in a response to a reporter's question that
Colombian drug traffickers apparently had organized the peasant
protest.
   A spokesman for the peasants said that the peasants grow
marijuana and coca because drug traffickers loan them money for
planting and buy the crops for cash.
   Government agencies will not loan money to peasants, the
spokesman, Javier Franklin, said in an interview published Tuesday
by Colombia's leading newspaper, El Tiempo, of Bogota.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has used glyphosphate
against marijuana plants in the United States.
   Earlier this month, DEA Director John Lawn said that marijuana
had been sprayed by the herbicide from the air for the first time
in the United States.

   Government officials, diplomats and economists
are among the first women admitted as members of the previously
all-male Cosmos Club, a 110-year-old private retreat for the
powerful and famous in the nation's capital.
   The group of 18 admitted Tuesday includes Secretary of Labor Ann
McLaughlin, U.S. Commissioner of Labor Statistics Janet L. Norwood,
former ambassador Carol Laise, microbiologist Rita R. Colwell of
the Maryland Biotechnology Institute, and economist Mary Dublin,
associate director of the Conference on Economic Policy.
   The club, housed in an ornate stone mansion, has long been a
retreat for government officials, judges, journalists, university
presidents, businessmen and scientists. Its ranks have included 28
winners of the Nobel Prize and 47 Pulitzer Prize winners.
   A 757-14 vote to admit women came last spring after almost two
decades of controversy that led to the resignation of some
prominent members, including Supreme Court Justice Harry A.
Blackmun. The District of Columbia Office of Human Rights found
last fall that there was ``probable cause to believe'' the men-only
rule violated the city's anti-discrimination law.
   Two women whose nominations to the club were previously reported
_ journalist Nina Totenberg and former League of Women Voters
president Lucy Benson _ were not in the first group approved. Club
officials said work on their nominations has not been completed.

   As many as 2,000 laid off workers in three
states will receive their unemployment compensation benefits in
lump sums for use in starting their own businesses, the Labor
Department said.
   The jobless workers in Oregon, Massachusetts and Minnesota will
be part of a demonstration project authorized by Congress last
year. The project will divert about $8 million in the unemployment
insurance fund to helping between 1,000 and 2,000 beneficiaries
``become successful entrepreneurs.''
   The program, starting in mid-1989, would provide cash allowances
equal to the amount laid off workers would normally receive in
weekly unemployment insurance benefits, the department said.
   ``Small businesses have been the primary source of new jobs in
the United States over the last decade,'' said Labor Secretary Ann
McLaughlin. ``This pilot project will help unemployed persons with
entrepreneurial spirit to create jobs for themselves by starting
new business ventures.''

   Lisa Marie Presley, the only heir of Elvis
Presley, was married last week and is expected to deliver the late
king of rock 'n' roll's grandchild next spring, her publicist says.
   Miss Presley, 20, and aspiring musician Danny Keough, 23, were
married Oct. 3 in a private service at the Church of Scientology
headquarters in Hollywood. They are now on a Caribbean honeymoon.
   ``Lisa and Danny have been talking for the past year about

   Hollywood moviedom beckoned, but Brandon
Tartikoff decided to extend his record as the longest-running
network programming chief and stay with NBC-TV, which he took from
third place to first.
   ``Several different jobs were offered to me, major studio
executive situations, independent production deals, but a few weeks
ago both Jack (Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric Co., which
owns NBC) and Bob (NBC President and CEO Robert C. Wright) met with
me and made a very generous offer for me to continue on at NBC,''
Tartikoff said in a statement Tuesday.
   Tartikoff signed a deal that will keep him at NBC ``into the
1990s,'' Wright said. He will keep his title as NBC entertainment
president and get a new one, chairman of the new NBC Program
Development Group.
   Tartikoff, 39, has been entertainment division chief since 1980.
NBC had never won a season before taking the top spot four seasons
ago. It has remained No. 1 since.

   Bruce Springsteen says he would like to
see more U.S. support for national liberation movements.
   Springsteen, in South America's largest city for the Human
Rights Now Concert, made his remarks at a news conference Tuesday
with other international rock stars, including Sting, Peter Gabriel
and Tracy Chapman.
   Springsteen said U.S. foreign policy ``does not reflect the
basic decency of the American people nor does it participate enough
in the struggle for democracy in the world.''
   ``I would like to see the next American president visit Africa
and South and Central America and learn to respect and value the
different cultures of the world. I would like to see the next
president offer more support to national liberation movements,'' he
said.
   The 15-nation music tour was organized to support Amnesty
International's campaign to promote the 40th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The last two concerts will

   Entertainer-business mogul Merv
Griffin has received the go-ahead to buy casino operator Resorts
International Inc., despite questions about whether he will
complete the deal.
   The state Casino Control Commission's decision Tuesday came a
day after Griffin's company announced it had allowed a deadline for
its $36-per-share tender offer to Resorts' stockholders expire.
   Griffin called speculation that he was trying to back out of the
deal ``ridiculous.'' But, he added, ``I want to be able to stay
very fluid and to be able to make a businessman's decision, and to
walk if everything is not done.'' Under the deal, Griffin would
purchase Resorts' stock, including that owned by billionaire
developer Donald Trump. Griffin would take control of the Resorts
International Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, Resorts' other
Atlantic City land holdings, and a Resorts casino in the Bahamas.
   Trump would purchase from Resorts its unfinished, 1,250-room Taj
Majal casino in Atlantic City next to Resorts.
   Before announcing the deal, Griffin and Trump engaged in bitter
negotiations for control of Resorts.

I say, `I have trouble just making it through a day.'''
   Miss Lansing, 44, a former model and actress, was named head of

seeking justice.
   ``To me, I'm just a nice Jewish girl from Chicago who wanted to

   Pope John Paul II concluded his final foreign trip
of the year with an appeal to Europe to reject a secular future and
look to its common religious heritage to guide it into the 21st
century.
   John Paul, who completes a decade as pope this week, devoted the
four-day trip in northeastern France to spreading his vision of a
unified Europe and shoring up the wilting Roman Catholic Church on
the continent where it first flowered.
   The pope got a sharp reminder of the divisions still plaguing
European countries as he gave a speech Tuesday to the European
Parliament, his main address of the trip.
   Shortly after he began speaking to the packed chamber, a
militant Northern Ireland Protestant leader, the Rev. Ian Paisley,
leapt to his feet and shouted, ``I renounce you! I renounce you as
the anti-Christ!''
   The pope paused and Paisley, an elected parliamentarian, was
dragged from the hall. Paisley has led opposition to the 1985
Anglo-Irish agreement which gave the government of
Catholic-dominated Ireland a say in the running of mostly
Protestant Northern Ireland.
   In addition to addressing the European Parliament, which plays a
consultative role to the European Economic Community, John Paul
addressed the 21-member Council of Europe and its Commission and
Court on Human Rights, all located in Strasbourg near the West
German border.
   The pontiff focused on Europe's future at a time of heated
debate on the subject. The planned integration of the 12 Common
Market countries' economies in 1992 has given rise to discussion of
a closer political union.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher drew criticism last
month when she declared that a U.S.-style European unit would
weaken individual cultures.
   The pope's statements sharply contrasted with Thatcher's
position.
   ``A common political structure ... far from endangering the
identity of the people of the Community, will be better suited to
guarantee more fairly the rights ... of all regions,'' he told the
European Parliament.
   John Paul built on a theme of a Europe extending ``from the
Atlantic to the Urals,'' in which political institutions are
subordinate to a common culture based on such ``Christian'' values
as freedom of speech and conscience.
   He paid particular attention to what he viewed as a secular
assault on the continent's ``Christian'' identity.
   ``It is my duty to stress vigorously that if the religious and
Christian substratum of this continent should someday be
marginalized in its role of inspiring ethics and in its social
efficacy, it is not only all of the heritage of the European past
that would be denied but a future worthy of European man,'' he told
Parliament.
   In visits to the cities of Metz, Nancy and Mulhouse, the pope
urged special attention to unemployment, the breakdown of the
family and other problems that have followed Europe's development
into a wealthy, high-tech region.
   He expressed distress at the dwindling practice of Catholicism
in Europe, especially France, where most people are Roman Catholics
but less than 20 percent regularly attend Mass.
   The pope drew large crowds in services at stadiums and
cathedrals, but few people seemed to line his routes through
Strasbourg and the misty countryside nearby. More than 10,000
police guarded the pope's routes in Strasbourg, many wearing dapper
gray Pierre Cardin suits.
   With this trip, his last of the year, the 68-year-old pontiff
has logged 40,000 miles this year and delivered 136 speeches in
France, Austria, Africa and Latin America.

   For the second time in two weeks, a Las
Cruces policeman has shot himself accidentally in the right foot.
   Officer Bill Schatzman, 23, was off duty when he entered his
home Sunday evening and dropped his .45-caliber pistol, which
fired, said Police Chief Ron J. Axtell.
   On Sept. 28, Schatzman was off duty when he was removing an
automatic from his holster and the gun accidentally discharged,
also wounding him in the right foot, police said.
   The department requires that police weapons be secure, but
Axtell said he was not sure those rules could be enforced if an
officer carries his weapon while he is off duty.
   ``I'm not saying he did anything wrong,'' Axtell said. ``It's
something we'll have to look into.''
   Schatzman was listed in good condition Tuesday at Memorial
General Hospital in Las Cruces, said hospital spokeswoman Lori
Allen.

   A gunman shot and killed two people, then hid
in an apartment building for nearly four hours before surrendering
to police Tuesday, authorities said.
   The gunman, whose identity was not immediately known,
surrendered about 9:20 p.m., said Cmdr. William Booth, a police
spokesman.
   ``There was no gunfire exchanged,'' Booth said. ``SWAT officers
gave him the option of coming out and surrendering and he did.''
   The woman was shot about 5:30 p.m. at the apartment complex on
the west side of the city, said Sgt. John Gambill.
   ``The suspect fled to the rear after the female was shot and
killed at the scene,'' he said. ``After that, he ran into another
man and for an unknown reason that man was shot.''
   The second victim died later at the University of California at
Los Angeles Medical Center.
   Later, the gunman barricaded himself into an apartment, Gambill
said. A SWAT team went to the apartment complex and surrounded the
area after the gunman ran inside.
   Investigators could not immediately determine a motive for the
slayings. The identities of the victims were not immediately known.

<HEAD>New Premier-Designate Expected To Stand For Cautious Economic
Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Czechoslovakia, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ladislav Adamec, Czechoslovakia's
new premier, is a moderate with a managerial background and is
expected to stand for cautious economic reform.
   Adamec will succeed Lubomir Strougal, who was widely regarded as
Czechoslovakia's chief advocate of far-reaching changes in the
sluggish economy but whose plans were watered down by party
conservatives.
   At 62, Adamec, a graduate of the Communist Party College and of
Prague's University of Economics, is considered too old to honor
recent official promises to rejuvenate the Communist Party and
government hierarchy.
   His main drawback is that for 18 years as deputy premier he
worked in the political shadow of Premier Josef Korcak and
Strougal, who stepped down Monday.
   In his younger years, Adamec had no chance to develop charisma
and establish himself as an obvious choice for more senior
positions in the government. He replaced Korcak in a reshuffle in
March 1987 when he was also promoted to the party's ruling
Politburo.
   Adamec has long been known as a good orator who would pinpoint
shortcomings in public, but some critics say that he has lost some
of the impetus as a reform advocate.
   His main advantage appears to be that in the eyes of many Czechs
he is not associated with the oppression that occurred during the
so-called ``crisis years'' of 1968-69 when then-party chief
Alexander Dubcek and his associates were purged in the wake of the
Soviet-led invasion.
   At that time he was still at the University of Economics in
Prague, while heading the industrial department of the Communist
Party's Central Committee.
   According to Western analysts, Adamec, who earlier had a
reputation of a reformer, appears to have adopted a more cautious
line but continues to criticize poor economic performance.
   Adamec wants modernization of industry by raising the technical
standard of plants and equipment.
   In a speech to a Central Committee session last December, Adamec
said, ``If we do not modernize the traditional engineering and
non-engineering industries, the inherited technical creativity will
gradually evaporate and that would cost us very dearly.''
   He also complained about requesting from the Czech industry
higher export performance without providing adequate funding for
technical innovation and higher qualification of personnel.
   Adamec was born Sept. 10, 1926 to a miner's family in Frenstat
pod Radhostem in north Moravia.
   In the 1945-55 period he worked in a rubber processing company,
ending as a deputy director. He subsequently was employed by his
hometown's electric company, where he became director in 1960.
   In 1960-62 he held local government jobs and in the 1963-69
period he headed Central Committee departments in Prague. He became
a member of the Central Committee in June 1966.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Among Those Who Bought Unlisted Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Finance Minister was among leading
political figures who bought unlisted stocks in a series of
questionable equitities purchases, the Japan Communist Party has
alleged.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was among those who purchased
shares of a real estate firm before they were offered publicly, and
later sold them for a huge profit, Communist Party Vice Chariman
Koichi Ueda said at a news conference Tuesday.
   The Communist Party said it obtained documents allegedly showing
the purchases by Miyazawa and senior private secretaries of other
leading politicians including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and
former Premier Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   Political secretaries in Japan are similar to Western
politicians' chiefs of staff and are politicians' closest aides.
   Takeshita, Nakasone and other political leaders have
acknowledged their aides were involved in the purchases but have
said they did not know about them at the time. The Communist
Party's allegations were the first against Miyazawa.
   Miyazawa bought 10,000 shares of the real estate firm
Recruit-Cosmos Co. for the equivalent of $195,000 in September
1986, a month before the shares were listed publicly.
   Ueda said Miyazawa made a profit of at least $130,000 since he
bought the shares at $19.50 each and they rose to more than $32.50
each when listed.
   In Western equities markets such transactions constitute insider
trading, or trading on privileged information, and are illegal.
Japan only has vague regulations concerning use of confidential
information in transactions, and companies are free to offer shares
to whomever they wish at any price.
   The government has moved to tighten Japanese laws against
insider trading but the action is not retroactive.
   Miyazawa's secretary, Nobuyoshi Nakatsu, said by telephone that
no comment from Miyazawa would be available.
   But Kyodo News Service said Miyazawa told Japanese reporters at
a hastily called news conference that he allowed former secretary
Tsuneo Hattori to use his name, ``but as I repeated again and
again, I myself am not involved in any dealings. I am, rather, a
victim.''
   Asked if the shares were bought under his or Hattori's name,
Miyazawa said he did not know. Hattori resigned last week, saying
he wanted to make way for younger people.
   One of the documents obtained by the Communist Party, widely
reproduced in newspapers and on television, shows the names of nine
reputed share purchasers, including Miyazawa and the aides to
Takeshita and Nakasone.
   Do Best Inc., a stock trading firm, acquired 80,000 shares of
Recruit-Cosmos and turned them over to the nine for $19.50 a share
a month before the shares went on sale, according to the document.
   Another Communist Party official who would not be identified
said the party received the documents anonymously but determined
they were genuine.
   The charges against Miyazawa apparently had little effect on the
Tokyo Stock Market, which a dealer said was slowed more by the
sharp fall of the dollar against the yen.
   The so-called Recruit scandal unfolded in July as a bribery case
in Kawasaki, a city south of Tokyo, but spread to encompass some of
the country's most powerful politicians or their aides as well as
senior journalists and at least one professor.
   Experts say the practice of selling stocks at low prices to
politicians has been common, with companies making political
contributions in this way.

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil has rejected a possible January
visit by Cuba's President Fidel Castro to inaugurate a Latin
American cultural center.
   It would have been the first since the two countries
reestablished diplomatic relations in 1986 after a 22 year break.
   According to Rio de Janeiro's respected daily Jornal do Brasil
newspaper, Sao Paulo governor, Orestes Quercia invited Castro to
attend the inauguration of the new Latin American center being
built in South America's largest city when he visited Cuba in
December.
   The newspaper said the foreign ministry told Quercia a visit
from Castro would not be appropriate.
   ``No official invitation was issued to Castro by the Brazilian
government, the invitation was a personal one,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Ruy Nogueira told journalists at a late news conference.
``And it is improbable, implausable and unrealistic that the head
of a foreign country would visit another without an official
inviation from that country.''
   Jornal do Brasil quoted high-level government sources as saying
that despite Brazil's now solid diplomatic relations with Cuba,
``sectors of the military might interpret an excess of hommage paid
to Castro as a provocation.''
   Brazil severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1964, shortly
after a right-wing military coup toppled former President Joao
Goulart. President Jose Sarney, who led Brazil back to civilian
rule in 1985 after being chosen in a military-controlled electoral
college vote, reestablished relations with Cuba one year later.
   The military still wields substantial behind-the-scenes power in
Brazil.

   Once again, there's talk of high stakes as
Michael Dukakis and George Bush get ready for their second and last
debate of the 1988 presidential campaign.
   Maybe this will be the breakthrough debate, the occasion when
one or the other will so impress voters with his eloquence or
ineptitude that the election will be decided then and there.
   More likely it will be an October rerun of their September
debate.
   A few new lines have appeared in the campaign weeks following
that debate.
   Look for Dukakis to hold up a $20 bill and deride Bush's
proposal for a $1,000-a-year tax deferred savings account Thursday
night.
   ``Twenty bucks,'' he tells roaring partisan audiences. ``Twenty
bucks.'' That, he says, is the annual tax savings Americans would
realize from the Bush plan.
   Crime has been a major stump theme for Bush in recent days, with
renewed attacks on the Massachusetts prison furlough program.
   What might voters remember of their first confrontation, the
debate that Dukakis likes to refer to as ``some of the best 90
minutes of this whole campaign''?
   They might recall Bush's stirring defense of his running mate,
Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle.
   ``He took a tremendous pounding,'' said the vice president ``and
everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.''
   Bush said Quayle would do ``very, very well. And he has my full
confidence and he'll have the confidence of people in their 30s and
40s.''
   The Republican nominee predicted his running mate would do
``very well when we get into the debates.''
   Quayle has since had his debate with Democratic vice
presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen. The Indiana senator came across
as overly programmed and the polls showed that he fell short of
Bush's expectations.
   Will Bush rise to the defense of Quayle again? That should be
one moment to watch for on Thursday night.
   That first presidential debate also was the night that Dukakis
gave a passionless response to a question about his lack of
passion, about the characterization that he is ``the smartest clerk
in the world.''
   ``I care deeply about people,'' said Dukakis. He said it again
and again.
   ``I am somebody who believes deeply ... I care very deeply ...
These are things I believe in very, very deeply.''
   He conceded that ``I may be a little calmer than some about it.''
   Dukakis did show a passion for certain words. He used ``lead,''
``leader,'' and ``leadership'' 18 times during the debate. He also
was partial toward ``values'' and ``strength.''
   When the Massachusetts governor was asked about his lack of
foreign policy experience, he gave this reply:
   ``The question is values, the question is strength, the question
is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be
provided. I'm ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the
commander-in-chief of this country. I think it takes fresh
leadership now and an understanding of those forces of change to
provide the kind of strength that we need. ... I don't think it's
just experience that makes a difference. It's strength. It's
values.''
   Twelve times, Dukakis referred to ``values.'' Bush wasn't far
behind, using the word 11 times _ six times in his first response.
   ``Liberal'' and ``liberals'' were Bush favorites; he used one or
the other eight times.
   He also used several other terms which mean the same thing, like
``ACLU,'' ``freeze people,'' a reference to supporters of a nuclear
freeze and such geographic symbols of liberalism as
``Massachusetts'' and with something of a sneer, ``Boston'' and
``Bostonians.''

   A leftist leader returned to
this Central American country from exile after the government said
he could resume his political activities if he renounced any ties
with Salvadoran guerrillas.
   Mario Aguinada Carranza, secretary-general of the Democratic
Nationalist Union, returned from Mexico Tuesday after spending
eight years in exile. The U.S.-supported government considers
Aguinada's party a front for the underground Communist Party.
   Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount told journalists
Monday night that Aguinada could participate in politics if he
renounces any post he may have held in the guerrilla organization.
   Aguinada had been scheduled to accompany two other Nationalist
Union leaders who returned from exile in July. He postponed that
trip in response to reports he would be arrested upon arrival.
   Communications Minister Roberto Viera said in July that Aguinada
had held a high, but unspecified post in the guerrilla hierarchy.
   Nationalist Union officials denied it, saying Aguinada's work
was on behalf of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, the political
organization allied with the rebel combatants.
   Aguinada told about 200 supporters at the airport: ``I greet you
again in this country of ours, for which thousands have offered
their blood and their lives in the struggle for liberation.''
   About 65,000 people have been killed in the war, most of them
civilians.
   A military communique said Tuesday that troops raided a
guerrilla camp in northeastern Cabanas province, killing two rebels
and wounding five.
   The army also said a soldier was wounded in one of numerous
harassment attacks Monday on army positions in different parts of
the country.
   Rebels also destroyed six utility poles in their continuing
campaign to sabotage electrical installations, the statement said.
   The guerrillas on Tuesday celebrated the eighth anniversary of
the founding of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
organization of five guerrilla armies fighting to overthrow the
government.
   ``We have carried the war to the cities and the rearguard of the
enemy,'' the rebels said on their clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   ``Our objective is to construct a new and sovereign country,
where the campesino can be the owner of the land he works, where
men have equality,'' Cmdr. Ferman Cienfuegos said in the broadcast.

<HEAD>Killing Of Australian Yachtsman Sparks Diplomatic Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shooting death of an Australian
yachtsman by Indonesian police has caused a major diplomatic row
between the two countries, with Prime Minister Bob Hawke rejecting
Indonesian explanations.
   The Indonesian government called the Aug. 14 killing of David
Blenkinsop an accident, but Hawke on Tuesday demanded a full
inquiry into the ``dastardly event.
   ``We are not going to have a situation where Australian
nationals can be pushed around, in this case killed, and just sit
quietly back,'' Hawke said. ``We will pursue this matter to see
that it is properly investigated.''
   The Indonesian Embassy in Canberra said police boarded the
couple's yacht and Blenkinsop and his pregnant British-born
fiancee, Joanne Mist, were shot accidentally during a struggle. The
embassy said the yachtsman drowned after falling overboard.
   Ms. Mist says Blenkinsop was shot twice and thrown overboard.
Her baby was not injured.
   ``Certainly the late Mr. Blenkinsop's fiancee has a quite
different story and I must say that I'm not prepared to accept at
face value some story on the part of Indonesian authorities about
an accident,'' Hawke said.
   Blenkinsop's parents said they spent $6,400 to search for their
son's body. Frustrated at the lack of information, they finally
wrote to Hawke.
   Thaufick Salim, spokesman for the Indonesian Embassy, said
Blenkinsop and his fiancee entered Indonesian waters during a
voyage from Thailand to Australia two months ago, to seek shelter
from rough weather and refuel.
   They landed on the island of Serui where their yacht was boarded
by police, who asked them to sail to the island of Biak for
immigration clearance and to collect supplies.
   ``Someone unfortunately told Mr. Blenkinsop they were going to
be arrested on Biak and he tried to sail in another direction,''
Salim said. ``After ignoring a warning from one of the police, Mr.
Blenkinsop rushed at the police officer.
   ``His gun exploded and hit Mr. Blenkinsop in the arm. It
exploded again and hit Ms. Mist,'' Salim said.
   Indonesian authorities said they could not complete their
investigation because they did not have testimony from Ms. Mist.
   Hawke said later that Indonesian authorities arrested a
policeman and a civilian officer involved in the incident.
   He said the shootings were appalling and despicable. ``It was a
dastardly event,'' Hawke said.
   He told Parliament he will continue to press for an impartial
and proper inquiry and put further pressure on Jakarta by promising
to take up cases of Australians jailed in that country. The Foreign
Ministry said 11 Australians are in Indonesian jails, mainly in
Bali, on drug offenses.

<TEXT>
   Mathematicians working with hundreds of
computers on three continents have successfully split a record-long
100-digit number into two prime factors, according to a report
published today.
   The final numerical sequence required for the solution flashed
into a laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif., at 2:03 a.m. PDT Tuesday,
marking a development that will probably force cryptographers to
rethink how some codes used by governments and banks are applied in
the future, said The New York Times.
   The 100-digit number was chosen by an elaborate mathematical
screening process to afford the maximum possible difficulty, the
Times said. The two factors found are 41 digits and 60 digits,
respectively.
   A number's factors are smaller numbers that when multiplied by
each other produce the larger number. A prime number is one that is
evenly divisible only by one or by itself.
   The project was organized by Mark S. Manasse, of the Digital
Equipment Corp.'s Systems Research Center in Palo Alto, and Arjen
K. Lenstra of the University of Chicago. They were helped by 12
users of about 400 computers in the United States, the Netherlands
and Australia who donated computer time when not needed for their
regular work.
   Factoring the 100-digit number took less than a month. In
theory, one expert said, a supercomputer like the Cray, operating
continuously, could have solved the problem in about a week. But
supercomputers cost thousands of dollars an hour to run, and
operating the range of simpler computers for short periods when
they were idle kept the cost down to virtually nothing, the Times
said.
   There has been rapid progress in the factoring field this year,
with the same group establishing a record with a 96-digit number
just three weeks ago. According to Lenstra, the record has been
broken about once a year this decade. Manasse predicted a 106-digit
number will have been factored by the end of the winter.
   Here is the problem they solved:

   The chairman of a House panel that oversees
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says a new report shows
the agency was ``more concerned with reducing paperwork than with
protecting claimants' civil rights.''
   The General Accounting Office released a report Tuesday that
said the EEOC did not fully investigate up to 82 percent of job
discrimination claims over a three-month period last year.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., who ordered the study as
chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, said ``The
EEOC's failure to fully investigate job discrimination claims is
further evidence of the agency's attack on civil rights
protections.''
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said 41 to 82 percent
of the charges closed by six EEOC district offices during the
period and 40 to 87 percent of charges closed by five state
agencies were not fully investigated.

<HEAD>US to Pay Former Patients Drugged in CIA Experiment $750,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said a settlement of a
law suit will provide $750,000 to nine people who were subjected to
mind-control experiments by their psychiatrist, whose research was
aided by a CIA front organization.
   The CIA in the late 1950s granted $60,000 to Dr. Ewen Cameron, a
Canadian, who used the money to conduct a series of experiments
with his patients.
   He subjected the patients to drug-induced sleep therapy for
weeks at a time, gave them LSD and administered electroshock
therapy at up to 75 times the usual intensity.
   Nine former patients of Cameron brought a suit in 1980 in U.S.
District Court in Washington, D.C., and a tentative settlement with
the CIA, now given final approval, was disclosed last week in
court. The Justice Department announced the final settlement

<HEAD>Dukakis Finally Responding to Bush's Negative Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS publishable editor's note at end on writer</NOTE>

   After enduring weeks of attack on hot-button
issues such as crime and the flag, the slow-to-anger Democratic
presidential nominee responded with the emotion his backers longed
for this campaign. But not before Michael Dukakis' own mother did
first.
   ``Can anyone get as low as this?'' 85-year-old Euterpe Dukakis
asked after recounting what she regarded as personal attacks by
George Bush and the Republicans.
   ``I am telling these truths because my son refuses to,'' she
said.
   Appearing together in Maine last weekend, both Dukakises
demonstrated dismay at a Republican campaign focusing on a handful
of issues.
   Bush has been blamed for trivializing the 1988 presidential
campaign. He has devoted weeks to attacking the governor of
Massachusetts over his veto of a bill requiring the Pledge of
Allegiance in schools; over a program allowing weekend furloughs
for inmates, including convicted murders; for membership in the
American Civil Liberties Union; and for moving slowly on pollution
in his own back yard.
   And he has had help, too.
   President Reagan's reference to Dukakis as an ``invalid,'' was
quickly retracted _ but the fact that he uttered it thrust onto
front pages the Washington rumors that Dukakis had hidden past
mental trouble. The rumors were false, by all evidence. But the
episode coincided with the beginning of Dukakis's slide in the
polls.
   Republican Sen. Steve Symms of Idaho asserted that an old photo
existed of Dukakis's wife burning an American flag in protest over
the Vietnam war. Kitty Dukakis denies it. No photo ever emerged.
But subtle damage may have been done.
   Dukakis has begun responding with his own negative assaults. On
television commercials and in speeches, he belittles Bush's running
mate Dan Quayle; he accuses Bush of plotting a ``raid'' on Social
Security; and he depicts Bush as lacking judgment.
   All of this is part of what frequently is lamented as the
negative nature of the 1988 presidential race.
   Minor issues, or outright distortions, are screamed while hardly
a whisper is heard about the national debt piling up by the
billions, relations with the Soviets, the AIDS plague, or the
hostages still in Lebanon.
   ``It is true _ it's a very negative campaign, and I say most of
the blame lies with Bush,'' said William Schneider, political
observer at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think
tank.
   ``I say his campaign is probably the most disgraceful in modern
American history,'' Schneider adds. ``It is also working. It is
both disgraceful and effective.''
   The only real surprise, though, is that this type of campaign
comes as much of a surprise to anyone.
   For one thing, look what happened to the two candidates who did
talk about the deficit. Democrat Bruce Babbitt and Republican Bob
Dole, like Walter Mondale four years earlier, found voters didn't
want to hear it.
   And the negative campaign is hardly a 1988 phenomenon.
   ``It is more negative at an earlier stage than any presidential
campaign I've seen,'' said Frank Greer, a Democratic consultant who
has been advising Dukakis on his debates. ``But it follows the
pattern of Senate and gubernatorial races ... The 1980s have seen a
real escalation in the use of negative advertising.''
   In fact, Democrats have become accustomed over the past eight
years to facing intensely negative campaigns centered on one or two
or three emotional issues in statewide races.
   NCPAC, the National Conservative Political Action Committee, ran
a series of campaigns in which they targeted Democratic incumbents
with intensive negative television commercials on a few emotional
issues. In 1984, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina ran negative TV
ads about his opponent for more than a year.
   Democrats have learned to deal with such campaigns by responding
forcefully.
   Dukakis's running mate, vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen,
faced a NCPAC campaign in Texas in 1982, when he was seeking
re-election. He fired back and won easily.
   On his campaign plane last weekend, Bentsen expressed relief
that Dukakis at last had begun to respond with their own tough ads.
   ``Where have they been?'' he said, holding out his arms in an
expression of frustration at the delay.
   Bentsen said the Dukakis campaign should have responded
immediately when, after the Democratic convention in July, the
Republicans began attacks on Dukakis's record and even his
patriotism.
   Some say Dukakis and his advisers are to blame for failing to
forsee the attacks, failing to recognize the visceral impact some
were having, and failing to respond before the damage was done.
   Dukakis, after all, has never before run against a serious,
conservative Republican campaign.
   ``One reason why he frittered away 17 points was because he
didn't respond and didn't go hard negative himself,'' said Larry
Sabato, political scientist at the University of Virginia.
   ``You have to fight fire with fire. You can't sit there and take
it. And you can't just occasionally respond and be defensive. You
have to give your response immediately, in tough terms, and then go
on the attack yourself. That's modern politics in a nutshell.''
   Sabato says the negative campaign shouldn't be a surprise when
viewed in a historical context, too. In 1964, for instance, Barry
Goldwater was depicted as representing the threat of nuclear war _
a pretty negative notion.
   The reason campaigns have grown increasingly negative is that
such attacks work.
   The issues the Bush campaign selected seemed to resonate with
voters as symbols of something larger and unsettling.
   Bush's aim was to raise doubts about Dukakis and depict him as a
Massachusetts liberal. He apparently has succeeded.
   In early August, Dukakis said Bush ``has some of the highest
negatives ever recorded in the history of American politics.'' He
was referring to unfavorable ratings in polls.
   Two months later, it is Dukakis who has the high negatives.
Polls show his unfavorable rating now tops 40 percent, exceeding
that of both Bush and Quayle.

   He sang ``Happy Birthday,'' doffed his
suitcoat in favor of a football jacket and, to the astonishment of
aides, kissed the two cheerleaders who presented the gift.
   Michael Dukakis was delivering what advisers hope he can deliver
again Thursday night in his final debate with George Bush _ a
genuine show of emotion, something Dukakis rarely allows himself on
the campaign trail.
   The Democratic presidential nominee arrived here late Tuesday
night and was staying in the Los Angeles area until the showdown
with Bush.
   ``One of the nice things about debates is that they get people
out from behind the balloons and out of the flag factory and it
gets them to address the issues,'' Dukakis told a crowd of about
350 people at the airport here.
   The Massachusetts governor had no public events scheduled today
but was holding meetings with about 20 aides and advisers on the
debate. The confrontation could prove crucial to Dukakis' attempts
to overcome Bush, who holds a slight lead in most polls but is
believed to have a larger edge in Electoral College votes.
   Dukakis aides, speaking to reporters on the flight from Boston,
said they believed voters were still not familiar with Dukakis and
that one of his major debate challenges would be to convince voters
he cares more about their concerns than Bush.
   Those aides were thrilled by what they saw in Fargo, N.D., where
Dukakis held an airport rally while his plane was refueled Tuesday
night.
   About 800 people who braved 45-degree temperatures to attend the
late-night rally appeared happy with Dukakis' performance as well.
   He had just finished greeting the state and local officials on
hand when he introduced Ted Mondale, a Midwest coordinator for
Dukakis, and the son of the 1984 Democratic nominee, Walter Mondale.
   Dukakis told the crowd Ted Mondale celebrates his 31st birthday
today.
   Then came the unexpected: Dukakis led the crowd in singing
``Happy Birthday,'' with even Mondale looking on in apparent
surprise.
   An upbeat Dukakis delivered his standard stump speech to the
crowd and told them ``victory is out there'' if they work hard for
a Democratic victory.
   He also took his staple swipe at Republican vice presidential
nominee Dan Quayle.
   Dukakis mentioned his choice, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, and
referred to him as ``the best qualified person for the job.''
   ``I wonder if the Republicans can say the same?'' Dukakis,
sporting a broad grin, asked rhetorically.
   At the end of the rally, two cheerleaders from North Dakota
State University, the No. 1 ranked team in NCAA Division II
football, presented Dukakis with a bright yellow Bisons jacket,
which he quickly donned before thanking the cheerleaders with a
kiss on the cheek. He sported the jacket on the flight from Fargo
to Los Angeles as well.
   Dukakis' pre-debate coaching has been rich with suggestions that
Dukakis make an emotional connection with voters.
   ``I think it's very important that the American people know his
values, know what he cares about,'' John Sasso, the campaign's vice
chairman, said during the flight West. ``The question is: Where are
you going to lead us?''
   California Rep. Tony Coehlo, who traveled with the Dukakis
entourage, said many voters would consider Dukakis a ``blind date''
because they do not know enough about him.
   ``The American people don't want to elect George Bush,'' Coehlo
said. ``They think he's OK but they don't want to elect him. They
want another option and just need to get to know Mike Dukakis to
have it.''
   Dukakis aides also make no secret of the fact that Quayle will
be a Dukakis debate target.
   ``It's obvious that a lot of people are frightened,'' Sasso
said. ``This is a guy who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.
... It scares people.''
   At the same time, though, Dukakis will try to frame the Quayle
selection in the larger context of Bush's judgment and also try to
contrast the proposals on health care, college opportunity,
housing, trade and education in recent weeks with what the Dukakis
camp terms as a Bush campaign of ``symbols and slogans'' that lacks
substance.
   ``They don't like where the dialogue is going and they want to
get it back on, who knows what, the Pledge of Allegiance,'' Sasso
said. ``This is not a ping pong match of one liners.''

<HEAD>Iraq and Iran Exchange Soldiers' Bodies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq and Iran exchanged soldiers' remains
for the first time since their cease-fire took effect seven weeks
ago, a senior U.N. official said.
   But an Iraqi government-run newspaper said there was no progress
in U.N.-mediated talks toward a permanent peace settlement.
   U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Marrack Goulding told a news
conference in the Iraqi capital that each side on Tuesday handed
over the bodies of eight soldiers killed during the eight-year war.
   He said the exchange took place in the war front's southern
sector, but gave no further details.
   Goulding, visiting Iraq and Iran for talks on consolidating the
cease-fire, said the exchange was ``a sad and moving event but it
showed that through the United Nations there can be cooperation
between the two sides.''
   Goulding was scheduled to leave today for Tehran for talks with
Iranian officials and a visit to the Iranian side of the front.
   U.N. peacekeeping troops are posted along the Iraq-Iran border
to monitor the cease-fire that went into effect Aug. 20. Peace
talks started Aug. 25 but are bogged down over Iraq's demand for
free navigation in the Persian Gulf and clearing the Shaat al-Arab
waterway.
   Goulding said the cease-fire was holding although both sides
reported minor violations and ``two or three'' soldiers were
killed. He gave no details of how the deaths occurred.
   The U.N. official also said some soldiers had been taken
prisoner since the cease-fire. But he did not say whether they were
Iranian or Iraqi and noted a number of them had been freed.
   Iran last month released 72 disabled Iraqis, but Iraq has not
yet freed any prisoners of war and is known to have taken more than
700 Iranians POWs in September in what Tehran called a major
cease-fire violation.
   According to the Red Cross, a total of 50,182 prisoners of war
are held by Iran and 19,284 by Iraq. But U.N. officials and
diplomats in Baghdad and Tehran believe Iran holds 60,000-70,000
prisoners and Iraq 30,000-50,000.
   An Iraqi government-run newspaper said Tuesday there has been no
progress in the Iran-Iraq peace talks since they started over six
weeks ago.
   The front page editorial in Al-Joumhouriya was the first comment
by Iraq's official media on the statement Saturday by Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akhbar Velayati, who said the two sides agreed
in principle to U.N. proposals to end the war.
   The daily said Iran has not committed itself to respecting free
navigation in the Persian Gulf and clearing the Shaat al-Arab
waterway, the estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and Iraq's
main outlet to the sea. It said there was no breakthrough in
negotiations and accused Iran of continuing ``delaying tactics and
procrastination.''
   Velayati said Iran agreed to a U.N. proposal that it give up its
right to search ships in the Strait of Hormuz, the strategic mouth
of the gulf.
   He did not mention Iraq's demand to clear the Shatt al-Arab
before letting the talks progress.
   The talks have moved from Geneva to New York and are expected to
return to Geneva at the end of the month.

<HEAD>China Would Accept Khmer Rouge Leader, Diplomats Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China may be willing to grant sanctuary to
Pol Pot, leader of the feared Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, to clear
the way for a settlement of the war in Cambodia, diplomats say.
   The communist Khmer Rouge, blamed for mass executions and forced
relocations during nearly four years of brutal rule in Cambodia,
were overthrown by the Vietnamese in 1978.
   But the Khmer Rouge's continued presence as a potent guerrilla
force has been viewed as an obstacle to negotiating the withdrawal
of Vietnamese troops.
   China supported the Khmer Rouge when it ruled Cambodia but has
been distancing itself from the group. Diplomats have said that Pol
Pot's exile to China may accelerate a settlement in the conflict.
   China has not ruled out such a development.
   ``The Chinese government would take any alien as a refugee to
China if the whole affair conforms with Chinese law,'' China's U.N.
Mission spokesman, Yuan Shibing, said Tuesday.
   Vietnam has said it would withdraw its troops from Cambodia by
1990 and has been negotiating with the three-member Cambodian
resistance, which includes the Khmer Rouge.
   Diplomats say China's acceptance of Pol Pot could help pave the
way for a settlement.
   ``This offer is what China intends to do if it is necessary that
Pol Pot and his close collegues should be given exile somehwere
outside of Kampuchea (Cambodia),'' said one Asian diplomat familiar
with negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   China, he said, still insists that Vietnam withdraw its troops
as a first step in any settlement. The diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity, described a possible offer of exile as
``the bottom line,'' but not something that China immediately would
offer.
   In Washington, meanwhile, Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
leader of one of the factions fighting the Vietnamese occupation,
said Tuesday: ``I think it is necessary to give the world some
guarantee about the Khmer Rouge in the future.
   ``I think the ones who are responsible for the genocide of the
Cambodian people'' in the 1970s ``must not continue to lead the
Khmer Rouge movement and they must go into exile if possible,'' he
said after a meeting with President Reagan.
   Reagan spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president reiterated
U.S. policy favoring a complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and
opposing a return to power of the Khmer Rouge.
   In a sign of Beijing's distancing itself from Pol Pot, Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen recently told the General Assembly
that the armies of the Cambodian factions should be dissolved and
replaced with a new national army, equally representing all
factions.
   Pol Pot's regime has been blamed for killing an estimated 1
million people.
   Chinese officials were expected to meet this week with
ambassadors of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to
discuss the Cambodian problem.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest of three factions fighting
Vietnam's occupying forces in Cambodia. Besides the non-communist
forces of Sihanouk, the resistance includes the forces of Son Sann,
a Western-leaning politician.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Calls Region's Foreign Debt Its Biggest Security
Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's defense minister says
Latin America's foreign debt is a bigger security risk than its
drug trade, insurgencies or border conflicts.
   ``Behind the drug trafficking and behind the subversion is the
incommensurable weight of the foreign debt, which erodes and
asphyxiates our economies,'' said Gen. Italo del Valle Alliegro.
   ``It is not just an economic problem, but a political and social
problem that can create strong centers of disturbance for our
systems,'' Del Valle Alliegro said in an interview with The
Associated Press this week.
   Latin American countries are struggling to pay foreign debts
totaling over $400 billion. Venezuela, which owes at least $34
billion, is the region's fourth-largest debtor.
   Del Valle, named defense minister in July, said Venezuela's
armed forces are committed to defending a 30-year-old democratic
system.
   ``We have a solid and mature democracy, and our armed forces are
convinced of their role of supporting the nation's civil
institutions,'' he said.
   He said Venezuela never adopted the doctrine of national
security which led to military takeovers throughout Latin America
because it felt the theory was ``authoritarian and
anti-democratic.''
   The theory, which broadened the scope of national defense to
allow the military a legitimate political role in keeping out
communism, originated in the U.S. War College and was further
expanded by the Brazilian armed forces.
   It is credited with having opened the way for military ousters
of civilian rulers in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile
and other countries in the 1960s and early 1970s.
   He said a document backed last year by military leaders
throughout Latin America, including Venezuela, did not constitute a
joint defense pact.
   The document identified the international communist movement as
the ``common and principal threat'' to the Americas. It was issued
by 14 Latin American nations and the U.S. during the 17th
Conference of American Armed Forces, which took place at Mar del
Plata, Argentina in November 1987.
   ``It was one working paper among many others. There is no
anti-communist pact,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Concerned About Western European Economic Moves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reiterated his
concern over Western European plans for economic integration,
saying they could work against cooperation with the East, Tass
reported.
   In a Kremlin meeting with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky,
the 57-year-old Soviet leader said Tuesday that Europeans have been
striving for economic internationalization and political
independence.
   ``But on the other hand, what awaits the all-European process if
the Western part of Europe cruelly closes itself off in a new
formation?'' Gorbachev asked, in excerpts reported by Tass, the
official news agency.
   ``How, then, would a `European home' be built?'' he said,
referring to a concept that calls on East and West Europeans to
cooperate politically and economically.
   It was the second time Gorbachev has expressed concern to a high
Western European official over plans by the 12-member European
Economic Community to create a single market in 1992, by
eliminating borders and unifying customs regulations. Austria is
not an EEC member.
   In a July 30 Kremlin meeting with West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Gorbachev said European politicians would
have to bear responsibility for any damage the proposal would have
on ``positive beginnings'' toward disarmament and strengthening
security.
   Gorbachev apparently shares the same fears expressed by other
world leaders that the 1992 economic unification of Europe will
shut out trade with nations that are not members of the EEC.
   He also may fear that the EEC will pose a more formidable
competitor to Moscow in selling its goods on the world market.
   Vranitzky arrived in Moscow on Monday and is scheduled to leave
Thursday.

<HEAD>Botha: Cuban Troop Withdrawal Timetable Still To Be Worked Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha of South Africa
says an agreement in principle has been reached on the withdrawal
of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, but that the timetable still
needs to be worked out.
   Botha, speaking at a press conference Tuesday, dismissed press
reports that South Africa, Cuba and Angola had agreed during
weekend a meeting in New York on a timetable for a troop withdrawal.
   ``The principle has been accepted, but the timetable needs to be
worked out,'' he said.
   South Africa has scheduled for Nov. 1 the start of an
independence plan for neighboring South-West Africa, known as
Namibia, but it has linked Namibian independence to a Cuban troop
withdrawal from Angola.
   Botha warned that the Nov. 1 deadline for beginning the U.N.
independence plan for Namibia may not be met.
   ``South Africa wants to see South-West Africa to be
independent,'' he said. But he said if ``other forces'' who are
taking part ``are not prepared to start with the necessary
machinery on the first of November, that is not South Africa's
fault.'' He did not elaborate.
   The parties involved in the talks are to meet later this month
in Brazzaville, Congo.
   In New York, Cuba's deputy foreign minister, Ricardo Alarcon de
Quesada, and Angola's ambassador to the U.N., Manuel Pedro
Pacavira, also said Tuesday that negotiators reached no agreement
in talks held Friday through Sunday.
   They spoke at a news conference in response to published reports
saying the talks reached agreement on a 24- to 30-month pullout by
the Cubans.
   ``We are at an impasse, which is not precisely synonymous with
agreement,''' said Alarcon.
   ``As you can see in the newspapers' reports almost daily, we
haven't yet achieved an agreement or understanding on the calendar
for the withdrawal of the Cuban forces in Angola,'' he said.
   Alarcon said Cuba and Angola need 30 months to train and equip
Angolan forces to deal with any future raids by South Africa or by
the Angolan rebels that are backed by the United States and South
Africa.
   The United States, serving as mediator in the talks, has
suggested a 24-month withdrawal and South Africa agrees, said
Alarcon and Pacavira.
   Pacavira said the conflicting proposals were advanced a month
ago in a meeting in Brazzaville.
   South Africa in the past has launched periodic raids from
Namibia into southern Angola to back up rebel forces when they
encountered heavy resistance from Cuban forces.
   Under a preliminary agreement in the peace talks, all South
African forces left southern Angola by Sept. 1.

   Federal agents gave new meaning to ``hostile
takeover'' by smashing a $32 million global money-laundering ring
that routed drug profits through a bank to Colombian cocaine
cartels, authorities say.
   Customs agents infiltrated Colombia money-laundering syndicates
and helped smuggle profits from drug sales out of the country,
federal authorities charged Tuesday in a series of indictments
naming 85 defendants.
   The charges resulted from a two-year investigation dubbed
``Operation C Chase.'' The ``C'' stands for C-note, slang for $100
bills.
   Among the defendants were BCCI Holdings, a Luxembourg-based bank
holding company with branches in 72 countries, and nine bank
officials.
   ``It is the first time an entire financial institution and its
important members have been indicted,'' said U.S. Customs Service
chief William Von Raab. ``We have given new meaning to the term
`hostile takeover.'''
   Tuesday's announcement came two days after the arrest here of 11
people, including seven en route to a bogus bachelor party,
officials said.
   The ``bride'' and ``groom'' were actually undercover agents.
   At least 40 people have been arrested around the world,
including this country, England and Argentina, officials said.
   Named along with BCCI Holdings were two subsidiaries: Bank of
Credit and Commerce International S.A., with operations in the
United States and London, and Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (Overseas) Ltd., organized in the Cayman Islands and
operating in France, Panama, Colombia, the Bahamas and the United
States.
   Authorities said the scheme operated this way: Bank officials
placed drug money in certificates of deposit in branches in France,
Panama, Uruguay, the Bahamas, Luxembourg and England, then created
a loan at another branch and allowed the traffickers to withdraw
the funds. The bank repaid the loan with funds in the CDs,
officials said.
   Indictments were returned in Tampa, New York, Chicago, Detroit,
Philadelphia and Houston, and warrants were issued in Miami, Los
Angeles, London and Paris.
   ``For some international banks, their sleaze factor is higher
than their interest rates. That's what we're talking about here _
just pure greed,'' Von Raab said at a news conference.
   He said the case should serve notice that the gates for
smugglers are closing around the world.
   In congressional hearings this year, BCCI and an assistant
director of its Miami office, who was among those indicted, were
identified as helping Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
hide drug-trafficking profits. Noriega has been indicted her and in
Miami on drug charges.
   Von Raab refused to comment on whether Noriega was involved in
the alleged laundering.
   The bank said in a statement that it ``is wholly unaware of any
violations of law that allegedly have been committed,'' but was
confident ``the outcome will be satisfactory.''
   U.S. District Judge George C. Carr on Tuesday lifted a federal
restraining order preventing BCCI from conducting all but routine
business without clearance from U.S. marshals. Carr acted after an
escrow account was established and the bank deposited $14 million,
the amount the government alleged was laundered.
   BCCI was founded in 1972 by a group of Pakistanibankers with
seed capital from Bank of America and rich Middle Eastern
investors. BCCI has assets of about $20 billion and reserves of
$1.5 billion.
   The trade journal American Banker said the privately held BCCI
ranks 326th among the world's biggest banks, as measured by
deposits, and 378th by assets.
   According to one indictment, undercover agents began the
investigation in July 1986, dealing primarily with Gonzalo Mora Jr.
Mora controlled a laundering network in Medellin, Colombia, home of
the Medellin Cartel, to service traffickers John Doe, also known as
``Don Chepe,'' in that city and Roberto Baez-Alcaino in Los
Angeles, the indictment said.
   Undercover agents received the money from various defendants and
laundered it for a commission, officials said. In most instances,
it was deposited in bank accounts here, then transmitted to Mora in
Colombia via blank checks drawn on the Tampa account, prosecutors
said.
   Agents first contacted BCCI representatives in February 1987 and
began opening accounts at various branches in July, the indictment
said.
   The indictments alleged possession and smuggling conspiracies,
as well as conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service,
launder proceeds of domestic cocaine sales and engage in a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   The major defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison
and fines of more than $5 million if convicted on all counts. The
bank faces maximum fines of more than $45 million.
   The U.S. government is seeking forfeiture of property, funds in
about 40 bank accounts and BCCI assets.

   Male strippers cavorted too close to
female patrons at a fire department fund-raiser, upsetting some
husbands and violating a state law requiring performers to remain
at least 6 feet away, a prosecutor said.
   During the male dance revue last month, strippers came close
enough for members of the Taneytown Volunteer Fire Department's
women's auxiliary to tuck dollar bills in the dancers' G-strings,
Assistant State's Attorney Jill Trivas said.
   State liquor laws require G-string clad strippers in eight
counties to keep 6 feet between them and patrons. The law also
forbids the touching of buttocks.
   ``Had I been aware of these things, I might have been able to
talk with these gentlemen and explain what they could do,'' said
Diane Perry, secretary of the women's auxiliary, whose members paid
$10 each to see the Sept. 23 show.
   The Carroll County liquor board, which took the matter under
consideration after a few husbands lodged complaints, expects to
render a decision in 30 days on whether the fire department was
responsible for allowing the violation to occur. Possible penalties
include a $2,000 fine.
   Ms. Perry asked the liquor board Tuesday for leniency, saying
she did not learn about the 6-foot rule until moments before the
event started.
   Ms. Perry said the show, which raised $2,000, could not have
been canceled that night ``without a demonstration.''
   Mustang, Rebel, Jaguar and Flash were among members of ``The
Fox,'' a traveling troupe from Lansdale, Pa., who have performed
for more than 400 fire department women's auxilaries in seven
states, Ms. Perry said.
   Fire Department President James H. Parker, who obtained the
liquor license for the event, told the liquor board he agreed with
the prosecutor's interpretation of the law.
   Parker admitted he was warned about the law when the board
granted a one-day liquor license for the revue. He contended the
women failed to heed his warning, issued less than two hours before
the show began.

   A former civilian weapons analyst pleaded
guilty to passing military secrets to South Africa, an act his
attorney said was motivated by a misguided sense of patriotism.
   Thomas Joseph Dolce, 49, pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District
Court to one count of espionage, the first such case involving
South Africa, prosecutors said. Dolce faces up to 10 years in
prison and a $10,000 fine.
   His attorney, Harold I. Glaser, said the father of three
believed the United States should be doing more to help what Dolce
considers to be an important U.S. ally fighting communism.
   ``He did it out of what he considered to be loyalty, but it was
of course a gigantic, gigantic mistake,'' said Glaser.
   Dolce, a former employee at the Aberdeen Proving Ground north of
Baltimore admitted mailing a classified document in 1979 to Col.
Bernardus Redelinghuys, a defense and armed forces attache at the
South African Embassy in Washington.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary P. Jordan, reading from a statement
of facts at a hearing, said Dolce ``furnished the South Africans
with anything he came across pertaining to Russian equipment. He
reasoned that the South Africans were confronted with Soviet
equipment in Angola and that the United States should be providing
this information to them.''
   Jordan said Dolce delivered the document to Redelinghuys because
of its potential use for sabotage by South Africa, a staunchly
anti-communist country that is ruled by its white minority under a
system of racial segregation called apartheid.
   Dolce also acknowledged delivering batches of classified
documents on 40 or more occasions, by mail and in person, to three
military attaches at the embassy and to South African missions in
London and Los Angeles between the fall of 1979 and the summer of
1983.
   For agreeing to plead guilty to the single count and to
cooperate with prosecutors, he was not prosecuted under a more
severe statute carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   Dolce had security clearance through his work for the Army
Material Systems Analysis Activity, a Department of the Army agency
charged with evaluating weapons systems.
   Glaser said Dolce was the only U.S. citizen involved, adding the
government learned of his client's activities ``inadvertantly.''
The lawyer declined to elaborate.
   Authorities said Dolce had insisted his activities were
motivated by ideological, rather than financial, concerns. Jordan
said there is no evidence that Dolce accepted money.
   U.S. authorities would not discuss the extent of the damage
Dolce's activities caused to national security.
   Alayne Resberg, press secretary for the South African Embassy,
said her country considered the matter ``history.''
   ``Two of the officers allegedly involved have already retired
from active service, and the third officer is no longer in the
United States of America,'' she said.
   ``We would just like to point out that South Africa doesn't
consider itself an unfriendly nation toward the U.S.A.,'' she said,
adding that neither the FBI nor the Justice Department has talked
to anyone in the embassy about the case.
   Dolce ended his relationship with the South Africans in 1983,
apparently because of a personality clash with the embassy's new
defense attache, authorities said.
   U.S. District Judge Herbert F. Murray ordered Dolce held in jail
without bail pending a sentencing date, which has yet to be set.
   Prosecutors said they would recommend Dolce be given the maximum
sentence.

   At least 15 people have been killed
this week by police enforcing a curfew in a southern district,
authorities said today.
   Officers at the military command said five people were killed
Monday in the town of Gandara, in the Matara district, when
Sinhalese demonstrators attacked a police station during a strike
to protest the government's attempts to win over Tamil rebels.
   An indefinite curfew was imposed in the Sinhalese-dominated
district after the incident, and police were ordered to shoot
violators.
   At least 10 people, including two women, were killed and 36
others injured when police fired at demonstrators defying the
orders, said the officers, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules.
   Monday's strike was called by the People's Liberation Front, a
radical Sinhalese group, which has opposed the July 1987 peace
accord aimed at ending the 5-year-old war by Tamil militants.
   The separatist war has claimed at least 8,500 lives.
   The accord was sponsored by India, which got involved in the
ethnic problems of its southern neighbor because of the sympathies
of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause.
   India sent in at least 47,000 soldiers to Sri Lanka when the
Tamils reneged on the peace plan.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. They claim they are discriminated against by the
mostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population
and control the government and military.

   A young firefighter battling a blaze in the
Shoshone National Forest near Yellowstone National Park was killed
when a 72-foot-tall tree fell on him, an official said.
   The death Tuesday of Edward Hutton, 26, of Casper was apparently
the second this fire season directly attributed to a blaze.
   Hutton, a federal Bureau of Land Management employee, was at the
edge of a meadow with other firefighters when the dead tree fell on
him from behind, said fire information officer Lynn Young.
   Hutton apparently died instantly, Young said. The firefighter's
body was taken to a hospital in this town east of Yellowstone.
   A falling tree killed a firefighter in Montana last month.
   In September and August, three people died when helicopters
involved in firefighting crashed in Wyoming and Washington state.
   Forest fires have burned more than 4 million acres in the West
this year in what federal officials have called the worst fire
season in 30 years.

<TEXT>
   Soul singer James Brown left for a monthlong
European concert tour despite pending court dates in two states,
and officials said they would seek to put the entertainer in jail
if he does not appear as scheduled.
   Brown faces several charges in Georgia and South Carolina, and
could forfeit nearly $33,000 in bonds if he misses the court
appearances.
   Buddy Dallas, Brown's attorney, said Tuesday that the singer had
left for the tour. Court officials said no requests for delays had
been filed.
   Brown has an Oct. 18 date in Augusta's municipal court on three
charges, including driving under the influence, stemming from a
Sept. 25 arrest.
   Harry James, solicitor for the court, said Brown ``is making a
mockery of the court system if he has no intention of appearing.''
   If Brown is not in court, James said he will seek a warrant for
Brown's arrest.
   The singer also is scheduled to appear Oct. 24 in Aiken County,
S.C., General Sessions Court to answer charges of assault and
battery with intent to kill, driving under the influence and
failure to stop for police stemming from a Sept. 24 incident.
   In addition, Brown is scheduled for arraignment in State Court
in Augusta on Nov. 8 on charges including carrying a pistol without
a license and carrying a deadly weapon to a public gathering.
   Dallas, meanwhile, said Brown voluntarily admitted himself
Friday to an Atlanta hospital for treatment of a drug problem.
   Dallas refused to identify the hospital.
   Brown tried to admit himself to an Athens, Ga., hospital Sept.
27, but was turned away for lack of space. Brown had said he would
try to enter the hospital again Sept. 30.
   However, he went to the Atlanta hospital because it could take
him sooner, Dallas said.

<HEAD>Alamo Battle's Descendants Still Fight On</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Alamo may have been at peace since 1836,
but descendants of those who fought there have a new battle brewing
over control of $1.7 million banked from souvenir sales at the
shrine.
   The Daughters of the Republic of Texas have always had charge of
the Alamo and its bank account. But the League of United Latin
American Citizens, angered over what it calls a misrepresentation
of history by the Daughters, says they should turn any surplus over
to the state.
   ``In my opinion, all they want to do is get their hands on the
money,'' Ella Stumpf, 84, one of the Daughters, said this week.
   The Alamo is a self-financing facility: No state tax money is
invested and the Daughters must generate funds from the souvenir
shop to pay for a staff of 65 and an annual budget in excess of $1
million.
   The mission, visited by 3 million people a year, occupies four
acres of state land in downtown San Antonio. The Daughters serve at
the pleasure of the Legislature, which alone has authority to end
their custodial role.
   ``I don't think too many people knew they had $1.7 million in
the bank off sales from their souvenir shop. I don't think anyone
had ever asked,'' said state Rep. Orlando Garcia, whose inquiry
into the Alamo ledgers started the current flap.
   Garcia said unless the Daughters ``have a great purpose for
these funds'' the money could become available to the state.
   When the attorney general ruled that the Alamo finances fell
under the Texas Open Records Act, the Daughters sent a copy of
their latest audited budget to Garcia.
   ``We'd never had to face this before. ... We're happy to do
whatever the proper authorities want us to do. We don't have
anything to hide,'' said Peggy Dibrell, a member of the Daughters'
Alamo Committee.
   Attached to the audit was a note explaining the intended plans
for the surplus funds: a new film and activity center, two new
educational films and a permanent operating ``hedge'' against a
sudden drop-off in tourism.
   Jose Garcia de Lara, president of the Latin American citizens
league, was quick to call for a full accounting of the finances,
with any surplus funds be considered for other state programs.
   ``Quite frankly, we aren't very adamant about taking over the
Alamo. Our main issue is we want accountability by whomever is
running it to the peoples of the state and to the history of our
citizenry,'' he said.
   ``The Daughters have created their history by perpetuating myth
and by omission: These thousands of bad Mexicans killed our few
good Anglos and this has made the chapel a symbol of oppression.''
   About 180 Texans, including Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, died at
the Alamo fort-chapel when it was attacked by an army of thousands
of Mexicans during the Texas Revolution in 1836.
   But Garcia, the legislator, said there is no historical or
cultural component to his inquiry.
   ``I don't have time to get annoyed by what did or didn't happen
in 1836,'' he said. ``What is at issue is access to records about
finances that should be public. My name could be Davy Crockett the
Fifth and I'd be asking the same questions.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain, sleet and even snow fell over the eastern Great Lakes
region as a low pressure system over western Quebec combined with
high pressure over Manitoba, Canada, to produce a taste of winter
weather.
   The low pressure system scattered the rainshowers late Tuesday
while the high pressure area provided the cold air that caused the
rain to become mixed with sleet at times.
   Rain and sleet were reported from northeast Ohio into northwest
Pennsylvania. Snow flurries fell on Canton and Akron, Ohio, and
occasionally at Pittsburgh. Snow was falling over northwest lower
Michigan late Tuesday, with accumulations of up to an inch reported
in some areas.
   The high pressure was expected to bring light winds and cold
temperatures tonight to the upper Mississippi Valley and upper
Great Lakes into the lower Ohio Valley and lower Missouri River
Valley. Lows by sunrise were expected to be in the mid or upper 20s
across the upper Great Lakes and in the lower 30s across the lower
Missouri River Valley.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the Great Basin of
Nevada late Tuesday, bringing heavy local rain, including
three-quarters of an inch at both Austin, Nevada, and Cedar City in
western Utah.
   Indianapolis dropped to 28 degrees early today, tying the record
low for the date, which was set in 1876 and also tied the same date
last year.
   For today, scattered rain or snow showers were predicted from
Michigan across the eastern Great Lakes and western Pennsylvania
into northern New England, while widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms were expected over parts of the Southern Plateau.
High pressure was expected to provide pleasant weather across the
Plains and the Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 60s or 70s across
much of the nation east of the Rockies; in the 40s and 50s from the
upper Mississippi and Ohio valleys to North Carolina, the
mid-Atlantic coastal states and New England; the upper 30s over
northern Michigan and portions of the northern and central
Appalachians; the 80s over southern Florida, southern Texas, parts
of eastern Colorado and central Montana, and across interior
valleys of California; and in the 80s and 90s across the desert
Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 26
degrees at Duluth and International Falls, Minn., to 80 degrees at
Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas.

   Highly radioactive waste from the Savannah
River Plant will be shipped to New Mexico under a project being
reviewed by the U.S. Energy Department, the agency says.
   A proposed facility at the nuclear weapons plant would prepare
the waste for shipment starting next year to the department's Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M., according to an
environmental assessment by the agency issued Monday.
   The New Mexico plant would eventually remove a potential source
of groundwater contamination from Savannah River: thousands of
cubic feet of stored waste containing elements heavier than
uranium, which are called ``transuranic.''
   Plutonium, manufactured at Savannah River for use in nuclear
weapons, is a transuranic element.
   The three nuclear weapons reactors at the plant near Aiken have
been closed for maintenance and safety checks amid a wave of
publicity about lax safety precautions.
   Savannah River is one of 14 sites that generate or store
transuranic wastes in nuclear weapons work and that will ship them
to New Mexico.
   The New Mexico plant is a research facility designed to
demonstrate the safe and environmentally acceptable disposal of
radioactive defense waste, the report said.
   The Savannah River facility would analyze, compact and solidify
newly generated waste.
   By 1995, when Savannah River is to start retrieving previously
stored waste for shipment, a projected 370,000 cubic feet of stored
transuranic waste will have accumulated there, the Energy
Department report says. Waste is stored in containers and trenches
at the plant.
   Starting in 1995, the report said, Savannah River's facility
would ship away 15,000 cubic feet of retrieved waste per year, and
export new waste as fast as it accumulates, at a projected rate of
6,200 cubic feet per year.
   The New Mexico project, which has itself drawn criticism from
environmentalists, will not end the South Carolina plant's
environmental woes.
   A report issued this week by Congress' General Accounting Office
notes that hazardous but non-radioactive wastes also have
accumulated at numerous sites around the plant. Some reports
estimate the total cost of cleaning up the plant at $6.5 billion.
   In addition, the transuranic project does not include waste
buried before 1970. The Energy Department decided the environmental
benefits were not worth the risks of unearthing the waste, the
report suggested.

   A pre-dawn fire ripped through
the headquarters of South Africa's Roman Catholic Church in
Pretoria today. Authorities said it was arson.
   There were no injuries, but a nun and three other people staying
in the building were rescued by firemen after they were trapped on
a balcony by the flames.
   ``If it hadn't been for the fast action of the fire department,
we would have all been killed,'' said one of the four, Rob Lambert.
   It was the second major attack in six weeks on the headquarters
of an anti-apartheid church organization. The main office of the
South African Council of Churches was devastated by a bomb Aug. 31.
   Police said four nearly empty containers of gasoline and
paraffin were found on the ground floor of Khanya House in
Pretoria, the headquarters of the Southern African Catholic Bishops
Conference.
   The fire seriously damaged the organization's archives and print
shop on the ground floor and also caused damage on two upper floors.
   Police said a mini-bus with 11 people inside, including blacks
and whites, was seen by a policeman at the building shortly before
the fire broke out about 2 a.m. The vehicle had a false license
plate, police said.
   No arrests have been made in connection with the bombing of
Khotso House in Johannesburg, which housed the offices of the
council of churches and other organizations seeking an end to
apartheid, or the white-minority goverment's policy of racial
segregation.
   Leading activists have suggested the bombing was carried out
either by right-wing vigilantes or by a covert security force unit.
   The Catholic Church in South Africa is predominantly black. Two
weeks ago, the Catholic bishops distributed a pastoral letter
suggesting Catholics consider not voting in this month's nationwide
municipal elections.
   Activists say the elections for segregated local councils serve
only to entrench apartheid and will bring blacks no closer to
obtaining voting rights on the national level.

<TEXT>
   CBS Television has deleted references to
American Indians as ``savages'' from a Thanksgiving-related
``Peanuts'' cartoon because an Indian parents group here
complained, a network official said.
   Carol Altieri, vice president of program practices for the CBS
Broadcast Group in Hollywood, said the producer's notes on the
script to ``The Mayflower Voyagers'' indicate that the word
``savages'' has been dropped throughout.
   The ``Peanuts'' special is scheduled to air Oct. 21 as part of
an animated historical miniseries called ``This Is America Charlie
Brown.''
   Ms. Altieri said the change was made because of concerns raised
by the Concerned American Indian Parents group of Minneapolis and
the CBS affiliate in Minneapolis, WCCO-TV. She said no other
affiliates had complained.
   The network distributed scripts of the cartoon and teaching
instructions to affiliate stations, which distributed them to
participating schools, said Joanne Brokaw-Livesey, director of
educational and community services for CBS in New York.
   Because the script referred to Indians as ``savages'' in at
least two places and included historical inaccuracies that gave
negative portrayals of Indians, WCCO-TV shortened the script and
revised the teaching instructions, said Tom Cousins, a consultant
for the station.
   He said the material being given to 52,000 students at about 150
schools in Minnesota was changed to ``foster cultural sensitivity.''
   ``We're going to go with the revised one to remove anything that
would be insensitive to the Native Americans,'' Cousins said. ``It
was corresponding with myths rather than actuality.''
   He said the cartoon wrongly portrays Indians as giving ``war
whoops'' and unfairly portrays the Indian Squanto, who befriended
the Pilgrims, as a ``grateful slave'' who learned English after
being kidnapped by an Englishman who took him away to Europe.
   ``The war whoops are a myth of the old-time cowboy movies,''
Cousins said.
   In the finished program, Squanto says, ``I served a wonderful
man who also had me learn English. And that man finally gave me my
freedom to sail back here to my land.''
   The network-distributed script was shortened by Cousins so that
it ends with the Mayflower's arrival in North America, and the
teaching instructions were revised to suggest ways for teachers to
discuss myths surrounding Thanksgiving, Cousins said. A committee
that included an American Indian and a human relations professor at
St. Cloud State University agreed on the changes, he said.
   Ms. Altieri said CBS will air the program despite objections
from Concerned American Indian Parents.
   ``We're not stereotyping Indians or Native Americans here as
much as we are telling the story of a man (Squanto) who, through
extreme adverse experiences in his life, brought those experiences
to bear in becoming the salvation of people who landed in this
strange land,'' Ms. Altieri said.
   She said the actual program may not come off as harsh as the
advance script in the eyes of those who have complained.
   ``I think it might be a mistake to make the judgement prior to
seeing the program,'' she said.
   But Phil St. John, a member of the parents group in Minneapolis,
said he still objects to airing of the program.

   South Korean delegates, elated by
their country's success as Olympic host, will be more flexible when
they resume talks with North Korea Thursday on reunification,
officials said today.
   The talks at the border truce site of Panmunjom will be the
first meeting between parliamentary officials of the two Koreas
since the 1988 Summer Olympics ended in Seoul on Oct. 2.
   ``The Olympics have given us new impetus. We will be more
flexible,'' a senior government party official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The two sides began discussions Aug. 21 on possible formal talks
between the two Koreas' parliaments but made no major progress in
four meetings. In the fourth session Aug. 26, each accused the
other of blocking agreement, but they agreed to resume discussions
after the Olympics.
   The two sides differed widely over both the agenda and format of
the proposed formal talks. North Korea demanded a joint meeting of
the nearly 1,000 members of the two Koreas' parliaments, but South
Korea sought a smaller meeting.
   ``We will be flexible about the two pending issues and make new
proposals,'' the South Korean official said.
   At Thursday's meeting, he said, South Korea would suggest that
each side send up to 100 delegates to the main talks. Previously,
South Korea had sought to limit the number to 25.
   In its flexible stand on the agenda, the official said, South
Korea may agree to discuss a North Korean proposal that the
parliaments of the two sides issue a joint ``non-aggression
statement.''
   North Korea said any such statement should call, among other
things, for the withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea and drastic arms reductions by the two Koreas.
   South Korea had sought to sign a non-aggression treaty rather
than a non-aggression statement, which has no binding force, but
Pyongyang officials maintained that the two Koreas are not separate
states and thus cannot conclude a treaty.
   South Korean officials said they would take a ``soft stand'' and
try to accommodate North Korean proposals as much as possible, but
they did not say whether they would consider the North Korean
proposal for a pullout of the American troops and arms reductions.
   Other topics expected to arise at the meeting include a recent
call by South Korean President Roh Tae-woo for summit talks with
North Korean ruler Kim Il Sung, the official said.
   In a major policy speech on Oct. 4, Roh renewed a call for
summit talks with Kim and said he was ready to end rivalry and
confrontation on the Korean peninsula. The summit, if held, would
be the first since the Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 into
the Communist North and capitalist South.
   In response to Roh's proposal, North Korea's official radio said
on Sunday the proposed summit would not be possible unless South
Korea accepted Pyongyang's pre-conditions, the South Korean news
agency Naewoe reported.

   The 10th tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season gradually strengthened as it followed a course that could
threaten the Lesser Antilles in two or three days.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, Tropical Storm Joan was centered near 12.2
north latitude and 50.8 west longitude, or about 575 miles east of
Barbados, moving west-northwest at 15 mph, the National Hurricane
Center said.
   The system has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph with some
stronger gusts, according to the center.
   Little change in strength was expected today, and Joan was
expected to maintain the same speed and direction for the next 24
hours, the center said.
   Joan, first spotted by satellite late last week in the
mid-Atlantic, was upgraded from a depression to a tropical storm
Tuesday. Tropical storms are named when sustained winds reach 39
mph and hurricanes when winds hit 74 mph.
   Four hurricanes have formed this season, including Hurricane
Gilbert, which killed more than 300 people and caused billions of
dollars damage as it ravaged Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico.
   The hurricane season runs from June to November.

   Palestinians hurled a hand grenade at a
civilian Israeli car in the occupied Gaza Strip today, and in the
West Bank town of Nablus Israeli soldiers blew up or sealed nine
houses of suspected activists, the army said.
   Nablus, a city of 120,000, was under army-imposed curfew for the
sixth straight day today following a bloody clash last week in
which troops shot and killed four people and wounded 21. Residents
said they were running short of food.
   No injuries were reported in the grenade attack on Nasir Street
in the center of Gaza City, the second such assault in two days.
   On Tuesday, a Palestinian tossed a hand grenade at an Israeli
patrol in Gaza City and wounded two soldiers, the army said.
   The two Arab attacks were among only a few involving firearms in
the 10-months-old uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel since 1967. Six Israelis and 295
Palestinian have died in the uprising that began Dec. 8.
   The army said the grenade today missed its target. Israel army
radio and an Arab reporter in Gaza said troops closed the area and
started searching house to house for suspects after the morning
incident.
   In Tuesday's attack, a Soviet-made grenade was thrown at the
first vehicle in a military patrol from the grounds of Nasir Eye
Hospital in a residential section of Gaza. Soldiers found the
grenade pin and handle in the courtyard of the hospital, an army
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Two army sergeants were lightly wounded in their legs.
   Also in Gaza City, the army today detained Ibrahim Al Yazouri,
an Arab pharmacist and the secretary-general of the Mujama
Al-Islami, or Islamic Grouping, a radical religious group. Al
Yazouri is believed to be the operational leader of Moslem
fundamentalists in the Gaza Strip.
   Israel radio quoted Arab reports as saying other fundamentalist
leaders were detained in the last few days.
   The arrests followed a rapprochement between radical Moslems and
pro-PLO activists, declared in the latest leaflets of the
underground Moslem Hamas movement and the PLO-linked Unified
National Leadership of the Uprising.
   In the West Bank's largest city, Nablus, soldiers blew up four
houses and sealed off five others in the Old City and the Ras
El-Ein neighborhood, the army said.
   It said the houses belonged to Arabs suspected of being members
in a nine-man squad of ``strike forces'' that enforced orders by
underground uprising leaders. It said several members of the squad
were arrested.
   They were accused of hacking and stabbing to death three Arabs
suspected of collaborating with Israel in Nablus in September, of
beating other Palestinians and of inciting riots.
   The squad's members belonged to Fatah, the mainstream faction of
the PLO, the army said.
   Nablus residents, under an army-imposed curfew, told The
Associated Press telephone lines in the Old City were cut off for
the last four days.
   Burning tires were seen in the streets of the Old City, and some
Palestinians climbed the rooftops to whistle and shout Islamic
slogans as an army helicopter circled overhead, those reached by
relephone in nearby areas said.
   ``There are many soldiers in the Old City, some of them also on
the roofs, and many army cars,'' one woman said. ``We saw the smoke
from the explosion when they destroyed a house.''
   Nablus residents also complained of food shortages caused by the
curfew.
   ``People are starving. This is the sixth day of curfew. We need
help. The babies are without milk. I called all the foreign
embassies and we hope they will help us,'' said prominent Nablus
businessman Said Kennaan.
   The army denied the charges. An army spokeswoman said Red Cross
and hospital officials were permitted to move freely in the city.
The curfew was lifted for two hours Tuesday to allow residents to
buy food, she said.

   Tourists could once again get a bird's eye view of
Paris today after workers at the Eiffel Tower ended a four-day
strike.
   The 100-year-old steel tower, France's top tourist attraction,
had been closed to visitors since Saturday morning because of the
strike by the 130 employees.
   Early today, a union strike committee announced that all the
strikers' key demands had been met, including an increase of about
30 cents in the $4.60 hourly wage.
   The Eiffel Tower stands 984 feet high, with three observation
levels, and is one of the few tall structures looking out over the
rooftops of a city of five- and six-story buildings. When it opened
in 1888, it was the world's tallest structure.

   Production on Jessica Lange's new film ``Men
Don't Leave'' was halted after a crew member was electrocuted when
a metal pole he was carrying touched overhead power lines,
authorities said.
   Police questioned Ms. Lange about the accident Tuesday night
that claimed the life of Patrick Dungan, 35, of Baltimore,
officials said.
   Dungan apparently was setting the set up for a rain scene and
was unaware of the power lines, authorities said.
   A doctor unsuccessfully tried to resuscitate Dungan, who was
pronounced dead at Sinai Hospital of cardiac arrest.
   Witnesses said sparks flew and nearby grass caught fire from
contofficials said. He was a
member of the Theatrical Studio Mechanics Union.

   Bonita Granville Wrather, actress,
businesswoman and widow of oilman-entrepreneur Jack Wrather and a
longtime friend of President and Nancy Reagan, died of cancer at
age 65.
   Mrs. Wrather died Tuesday at St. John's Hospital here, said
family spokesman Mickey Freeman.
   A statement from the Reagans called Mrs. Wrather ``a figure of
beauty and grace in the motion-picture business.''
   ``But more than that, she was a warm and caring friend. For so
many years, she enriched our lives with her sparkling personality,
her wonderful sense of humor, her loyalty and her love,'' the
Reagans said.
   One of her last public appearances was in June, when she retired
as chairwoman of the American Film Institute.
   ``We grieve with the family that this vital woman, whose life
spanned so many accomplishments as an actress, wife, mother,
corporate executive, philanthropist, inspirational leader and
friend, will no longer be at our side,'' said institute director
Jean Firstenberg.
   She had been chairwoman of Wrather Corp., the entertainment
conglomerate that ran the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim and Queen
Mary and Spruce Goose attractions in Long Beach and owned
syndication rights to the ``Lone Ranger'' and ``Lassie'' television
shows. Wrather was sold to the Walt Disney Co. for $152 million
last January.
   Mrs. Wrather was born in New York City on Feb. 12, 1923. She was
nicknamed ``Bunny'' after her vaudeville star father, Bernard
``Bunny'' Granville.
   By the time she was 7, she had starred in her first film,
``Westward Passage.''
   She earned an Academy Award nomination for her role as a lying
school girl in the 1936 movie ``These Three,' and by the time she
was 23 had been in 50 films, including ``Cavalcade,'' ``Ah,
Wilderness,'' ``Now Voyager'' ``The Plough and the Stars,'' and
``Hitler's Children.'
   In 1946, Mrs. Wrather starred in ``The Guilty,'' and fell in
love with the movie's producer, Texas oilman Wrather. They married
the next year; he died in 1984.
   She appeared on television in the 1950s in such shows as ``The
U.S. Steel Hour,'' ``Playhouse 90,'' ``Climax,'' and ``Studio One.''
   In 1972, President Nixon appointed Mrs. Wrather to serve on the
Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center. She was appointed
for another term in 1982 by President Reagan.
   Funeral services were pending.
   Mrs. Wrather is survived by son Christopher and daughters Linda
Wrather-Finochiaro and Molly Wrather-Dolle.

<HEAD>Seven Boston Detectives Sentenced in Shakedown Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven current and former Boston Police detectives
have been sentenced to two to five years in prison for shaking down
bars and restaurants, but say they'll appeal their convictions.
   The four former and three current detectives were sentenced
Tuesday after having been found guilty last month of conspiring to
extort more than $18,000 in bribes in return for protecting bars
and restaurants from inspections, overlooking violations or seeking
to influence liquor regulations cases.
   Prosecutors Diane Kottmyer and James Farmer charged the
detectives with selling their badges for influence, while defense
attorneys maintained that the detectives were only accepting gifts
from people they worked with closely over several years.
   The sentences handed down by U.S. District Judge A. David
Mazzone were lower than those sought by the prosecutors, but
Kottmyer and Farmer said they were satisfied.
   ``The message is that police officers, just like all other
citizens, are bound by the constraints of the law,'' Kottmyer said.
   Explaining the sentences, Mazzone said, ``It's difficult not to
be impressed by their records.''
   Former detective Francis X. Sheehan got the stiffest sentence:
five years. The others received sentences of two years or three
years.
   ``They sold the public trust in return for personal gain,''
Kottmyer said in arguing for penalties of up to 10 years.
   A defense attorney, Anthony Cardinale, said an appeal was
planned, challenging rulings by Mazzone that prevented the defense
from attacking the credibility of prosecution witnesses, some of
whom, the detectives claim, were bar owners of dubious repute.
   Addressing the court before he was sentences, defendant Thomas
J. Connolly drew applause from some 30 detectives when he told
Mazzone: ``I don't think in my heart I ever sold my badge. ... I am
not a racketeer; I never have been a racketeer.''

   UPDATE with two Sikhs appealing for mercy. Picks up 6th graf pvs,
`The convictions...'
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today approved the execution of
two Sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi, news reports said.
   District Judge S.C. Jain signed the ``black warrants''
authorizing the hanging of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, the
United News of India said.
   The warrants were delivered to the superintendent of the
maximum-security Tihar Central Jail in New Delhi, where the two men
are being held, the news agency reported.
   The execution date was not immediately disclosed, the news
agency said.
   Shortly after the warrants were signed, lawyers for both men
appealed for mercy to President Ramaswamy Venkataraman, who must
rule within 90 days, a Home Ministry spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   The convictions and death sentences for both men has been upheld
and the Supreme Court has rejected their appeals. The conviction
and death sentence of a third man, Balbir Singh, was overturned in
August for lack of evidence.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed in the garden of her home on
Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and
Beant Singh.
   Both were involved in a gun battle with other security guards
minutes after the assassination, and Beant Singh died of bullet
wounds.
   The two are not related. Singh, which means lion in the Punjabi
language, is part of every Sikh's name by doctrine of the faith.
   Kehar Singh, Beant Singh's maternal uncle, was arrested on Nov.
30, 1984, and charged with conspiracy in the case.
   The assassination was apparently in revenge for an army raid
Mrs. Gandhi ordered four months earlier on the Golden Temple, the
holiest Sikh shrine, to counter separatist militants entrenched
inside. At least 1,200 died in the raid, most of them Sikhs.
   After an eight-month trial in a makeshift courtroom at Tihar
Central Jail, Satwant Singh was convicted of assassinating Mrs.
Gandhi. Kehar Singh and Balbir Singh were found guilty of aiding
the conspiracy.
   The Delhi High Court upheld the convictions and death sentences
on Dec. 3, 1986. The Supreme Court on Aug. 3 also confirmed the
death sentences of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, but acquitted
Balbir Singh.

   Tanks and troops disappeared from the
streets of Algiers at dawn today when the government abruptly
lifted a state of emergency imposed during violent nationwide
protests last week.
   Armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled away from public
buildings and main intersections at 5 a.m. in this Mediterranean
port city. Only the Defense Ministry and other military
installations were manned by soldiers.
   But more than 3,000 looters and agitators arrested in the last
hours of the state of emergency still were being held in the police
school at El Biar and elsewhere.
   The government acknowledged that at least 180 people were killed
nationwide in the past week, but unofficial counts placed the death
toll at more than 500.
   More than 1,000 people were said to have been injured, mostly by
machine-gun fire directed at crowds of demonstrators.
   Shops were open today, and government offices, public services
and Algiers' vital harbor were functioning normally.
   A 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was also lifted, effective this
morning.
   Islamic fundamentalists, recognizable among the generally
European-clad population of Algiers by their flowing white robes,
could not be found this morning.
   They had sought to take over the spontaneous protests against
high prices and a government austerity program, and their calls for
demonstrations were widely followed.
   President Chadli Bendjedid promised in a nationwide television
address Monday to meet demands for economic and political reform.
He said there would be a purge of those responsible for the crisis,
but he gave no specifics.
   There was speculation Mohamed Cherif Messaadia,
secretary-general of the National Liberation Front, the sole legal
political party, would be among those purged.
   The party and its boss have not spoken publicly since the crisis
began Oct. 4. Political analysts said the party's authority has
been seriously reduced by the riots.
   In his speech, Bendjedid made no mention of the party, saying
political reforms would be publicly debated and perhaps submitted
to a referendum.
   Bendjedid's speech was widely seen as weak, but the government
organized ``spontaneous'' demonstrations of support for it
throughout the country.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
the official death toll of about 180 was low, but they also
contended that reports of up to 500 dead were exaggerated.
   Reliable accounts from hospital, medical and police sources
indicated at least 400 people died and more than 1,000 were injured
in the biggest crisis faced by the government since its
independence from France in 1962.
   Among those killed in violence Monday was Sid Ali Benmechiche, a
senior editor at the official Algerie Presse Service, said
diplomatic and family sources.
   The government announced Friday that 900 people were arrested,
but sources following judicial proceedings said more than 3,000
people were in custody.
   In the eastern city of Annaba, trials began Tuesday for people
arrested during the riots, and six demonstrators were sentenced to
prison terms ranging from four to eight years, the Algerian League
of Human Rights said in Algiers.
   According to lawyers present in the courtroom, the charges were
vandalism, sabotage and attacks on government and private property.
   Food shortages, soaring prices and low wages were among the
complaints when the protests began in Algiers and more than a dozen
provincial cities.
   Demonstrators targeted an austerity program introduced by
Bendjedid in January. Measures include cutting food subsidies,
reducing the workforce at some nationalized industries and giving
those industries more autonomy.
   Algeria, which has a Soviet-style centrally directed economy,
has been hurt by the crash of oil prices. More than 95 percent of
the north African country's exports come from oil and natural gas.

   Edward Chodorov, a Broadway playwright who also
wrote or produced some 50 films, has died at the age of 84.
   Chodorov died at his home Sunday after a brief illness.
   A native of New York, Chodorov briefly attended Brown
University. But according to ``Act One,'' the autobiography of his
friend Moss Hart, Chodorov, Hart and their friend S.J. Perelman
favored spending their time in the Automat, scheming about how to
break into show business.
   The movies Chodorov wrote or produced included ``The Story of
Louis Pasteur,'' for which Paul Muni won an Oscar; ``The
Hucksters'' starring Clark Gable, Deborah Kerr, Ava Gardner and
Sydney Greenstreet; and ``Road House'' with Ida Lupino and Richard
Widmark.
   In 1935, he wrote and directed ``Kind Lady,'' a dramatization
for the theater of a story by Hugh Walpole, which was made into two
movies.
   His plays ``Those Endearing Young Charms,'' ``Decision'' and
``Common Ground'' played on Broadway during World War II.
   Chodorov was blacklisted by the Hollywood studios in 1953 for
failing to cooperate with the House Committee on Un-American
Activities after choreographer Jerome Robbins labeled him as a
member of the Communist Party. That same year, ``Oh, Men! Oh,
Women!,'' Chodorov's most successful play, opened on Broadway to
critical and popular acclaim.
   Chodorov is survived by his wife, Rosemary, two children, two
grandchildren and a brother.

   A Soviet economist says boosting food subsidies
will only fuel inflation but that modernizing agriculture will help
reduce waste that costs $96 billion annually.
   Kim N. Khmelkov, an economist and director of a Moscow-area
farming enterprise, said that to finance more subsidies, the
government probably will have to take the money from state-run
enterprises, the Communist Party daily Pravda reported Tuesday.
   Those enterprises in turn would be forced to raise prices to
make up for the loss, he said.
   ``In a word, it's a race in a circle. (Price increases) would
not strengthen the economy, but destabilize it. And the
destabilization would start with those with the lowest incomes,''
Pravda quoted him as saying.
   Many Soviet economists have said the prices of basic commodities
must be increased in the next few years to make the economy more
efficient. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has promised consumers
will be compensated for any price increases.
   Khmelkov said that officials must instead keep strict control
over prices and end vast inefficiencies in agriculture.
   As an example, he said a new kind of milking machine that could
easily be produced in the Soviet Union would increase milk
production by 10 percent to 15 percent while saving $4 billion
across the country.
   In West Germany, financial sources said a consortium of banks
plans to sign a $1.6 billion credit agreement for the Soviet Union.
The New York Times said Soviet officials hope to use the money to
improve the nation's food processing and consumer goods industries.
   Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest commercial bank, is
heading the consortium involved in the agreement, which would be
the biggest Western credit line ever to the Soviet Union.
   Scientists have calculated that inefficiency and waste in Soviet
agriculture account for $96 billion a year, Khmelkov said.
   ``That's half the cost of what is grown in the fields and
farms,'' he said.
   The government spends $105 billion a year to keep the prices of
milk, meat, bread and other food products low in keeping with
long-term policies officials have espoused as proof of the
superiority of their economic system.
   Khmelkov said his enterprise produces beef costing $2.50 a pound
but it is sold in stores at government prices 80 cents lower.
   The economist said it costs other farms twice as much to produce
the same amount of meat and the state picks up the difference
between the cost of production and the retail price.
   Nevertheless, some Moscow consumers cannot afford to buy meat,
which is not always available, he said.
   In addition to considering retail price increases, Gorbachev has
been trying to trim the top-heavy management of the state-run
agricultural system. The Soviet president also is trying to
encourage state farms to give more responsibility to families and
small groups of workers, allowing them to earn more money for
better work.

   Paula Ann Moore was home watching
television when a local newscast flashed her photograph on the
screen and reported that she had been murdered.
   A Paula Ann Moore had indeed been killed the previous day. She
was from Rockford, 18 years old and black. Two local television
stations illustrated the story by using the ninth-grade school
photograph of the Paula Ann Moore who was alive, from Rockford, 18
_ and white.
   ``I knew that a Paula Ann Moore had been killed,'' Ms. Moore
said Tuesday. ``But then the news showed my picture. I didn't know
what to do. All I could think was that everybody, my friends and
relatives, would think I was dead.
   ``I called my mom right away. I guess I kind of freaked out.''
   Paula was not the only one upset. Friends and relatives began
calling her mother, Rebecca, Friday after reading newspaper
accounts _ minus the photograph _ of the slaying.
   ``The phone started ringing at 7 a.m.'' Rebecca Moore said. ``I
spent the whole morning explaining to people that our Paula was
fine.''
   Mrs. Moore was so busy making calls that she missed the 5 p.m.
newscasts. She sat down to watch the 10 p.m. news.
   ``I knew it wasn't my daughter who was dead, but seeing her
picture like that and hearing the story, I was shaking all over,''
said Mrs. Moore.
   She said her daughter's photo accompanied the murder story on
two local stations, WIFR and WREX. Spokesmen for both channels
confirmed that they had used the wrong photograph. The two stations
apologized for the error during Tuesday newscasts, Mrs. Moore said.
   Mrs. Moore said officials from Jefferson High School, where her
daughter attended classes, told her they did not release the
picture.
   Linda Dawson, spokeswoman for the Rockford School District, said
no one from administrative headquarters released the photo either.
She speculated that the television stations obtained a school
yearbook independently.
   The real victim was found dead Thursday in a small storage shed
behind a Rockford home. Police said the woman, who had been a
live-in baby sitter at the home for the last month, was reported
missing by her family several weeks ago.
   Bennie F. Jones, described by police as an acquaintance of the
victim, turned himself in Thursday night. He has been charged with
first-degree murder.

<TEXT>
   An organizer of a marijuana-smuggling
ring ordered by a judge to open an AIDS hospice rather than serve
years in prison says he's pleased with the sentence, but may have
had an easier time behind bars.
   The sentence issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Gene Carter,
believed to be the first of its kind in the country, calls for
Harvey M. Prager to operate a hospice in Maine that will house at
least three AIDS victims.
   The 41-year-old Prager, who helped open the first AIDS hospice
in South America, and his French-born wife, Sandrine, will act as
non-paid resident managers for five years.
   ``I'm sure ... two or three weeks down the road, when we're in
the grip of the struggle, we'll think it may have been easier to
have gone to jail,'' said Prager, who had requested the sentence.
   Prager pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy, possession and
importation of marijuana. He could have received up to 15 years in
prison and a $125,000 fine.
   The sentence proposal drew criticism from the public, and some
people have written letters to newspapers calling it ``outrageous''
and an ``insult to all law-abiding citizens of Maine.''
   However, it was applauded by advocates of alternative prison
sentences, among them a private, non-profit group called Sentencing
Options, which helped devise the plan.
   ``There's not much point in his going to prison,'' director Joan
Gauche said. ``He has a lot to offer and society is going to
benefit.''
   Carter, who is known for handing down maximum penalities in
drug-related cases, said he will impose a jail term if the hospice
fails to materialize.
   ``I am concerned that you do what you say you'll do because ...
if you do not do this, I will not hesitate to reconsider this
matter,'' Carter told Prager, a Yarmouth resident.
   More than 20 others connected with the smuggling operation _
which imported more than 20 tons of marijuana worth $83 million
through Deer Isle between 1979 and 1981 _ each have been sentenced
to up to 10 years in prison.
   Prager, an art broker described by family and friends as a
well-educated, intelligent man who had a few bad years, said he
will have the hospice open by the Oct. 1, 1989, deadline imposed by
the judge.
   ``I think we have taken the harder road and I'm hoping that
people do realize that we're about to do a lot of very, very hard
work,'' he said. ``We're pleased to be able to do this work, but I
don't believe it'll be easy.''
   As part of a plea agreement, Prager will forfeit proceeds from
the smuggling operation and liquidate his assets, which include a
$500,000 townhouse in London, a Paris apartment worth about
$200,000, property in the Caribbean and at least one Swiss bank
account, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Groff III.
   The assets are estimated to be ``well in excess'' of $1 million,
Groff said, and the government will receive two-thirds and leave
one-third for Prager.
   Jerry Miller, president of the National Centers for Institutions
and Alternatives, said he believes this is the first time a judge
has approved opening an AIDS hospice as an alternative to prison.
   ``It's a lot more productive than all the jailing we're into,''
Miller said in a telephone interview from his Alexandria, Va.,
office. ``I wish we could be as creative as that for the average
offender.''

   Prime Minister Mohammad Hasan Sharq
said today his government is committed to seeking a negotiated
settlement to end the war with Moslem guerrillas.
   Sharq also said he hoped the U.S. presidential election next
month will lead to a change in Washington's policy toward the
U.S.-supported guerrillas.
   ``We hope that the smell of blood of innocent people will no
longer be to the liking of the leaders of the United States of
America,'' Sharq said during a 90-minute meeting with Western
reporters.
   He made no new offers that might persuade the guerrillas to stop
fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government, but he indicated a
preference for making deals with local guerrilla commanders inside
the country rather than trying to persuade their Pakistani-based
leaders to give up the fight.
   ``If we are not able to have ways of negotiating with all of
them, we will have negotiations with some of them,''the 63-year-old
prime minister said. ``Those who are sharing the miseries of the
people of Afghanistan will come first.''
   The Afghan government has been pursuing a policy of trying to
establish what it calls ``coalition governments'' at the provincial
level. If successful, this strategy could neutralize _ on a
piecemeal basis _ the guerrillas by persuading them to lay down
their arms in exchange for local power.
   The prime minister, whose remarks in Dari were translated into
English by government officials, urged the United States and
Pakistan to stop arming the guerrillas.
   He dismissed any similarity between the United States' arming of
the guerrrillas and the Soviet Union's resupplying of the Afghan
army. He said the Kremlin has been arming the Afghan government for
35 years.
   American aid to the guerrillas began in earnest when Soviet
troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to support the
communist government after a coup.
   Soviet troops started withdrawing from Afghanistan on May 15
under terms of an agreement reached in Geneva. The withdrawal is
now half completed, and the remaining Soviet soldiers _ estimated
at 50,000 to 60,000 _ are to be gone by Feb. 15, 1989.

   Safety problems that halted production of U.S.
nuclear weapons materials expose a ``bad trend'' and a ``sense of
complacency'' in the operations of nuclear plants, top Energy
Department officials said today.
   ``The risks we are facing are serious,'' said Richard
Starostecki, deputy assistant energy secretary for safety, health
and quality assurance.
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said Tuesday that the
government will not be able to manufacture nuclear weapons
materials for 2{ months because of safety problems, but he said
that raises no threat to national security.
   The department had planned to restart one of its three nuclear
weapons reactors at its Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as
early as next month, but now does not expect the first of them to
reach full operation until January, Herrington said.
   Starostecki, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' said the
nation's aging nuclear weapons manufacturing plants must remain in
operation for another 10 to 15 years while they are being replaced.
The Savannah River reactors began operations in 1954.
   ``These are the only supplies we have for our national
security,'' said Starostecki. ``We're trying to take measures now
before the situation does degrade and we have a serious accident.''
   Referring to the shutdown last weekend of the main plutonium
processing plant at Rocky Flats in Golden, Colo., because of a
radioactive contamination incident, he said, ``The incident of the
workers is indicative of a bad trend and we want to stop it before
it does result in any off-site release'' of radioactive material.
   Starostecki said the Rocky Flats facility should be able to
restart in about two months.
   The top Energy Department spokesman, C. Anson Franklin, said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' that some contractors and department managers
have become so accustomed to the old equipment that ``they don't
stop long enough to see what was the cause'' of minor problems.
   ``We think there is a sense of complacency in the department,''
Franklin said.
   All three of the Savannah reactors have been closed down for
maintenance and safety checks amid a wave of publicity about lax
safety precautions.
   The department, said Herrington, ``will not operate unsafe
reactors. We will meet the defense needs of this country in a safe
manner and an environmentally sensitive manner.''
   Herrington's deputy, Joseph F. Salgado, outlined what he called
a ``phased restart.'' It will include supervision by a senior
manager at Savannah River and a review of safety at various
milestones during the four weeks officials say will be needed to
take the first reactor to full power.
   Salgado said he foresaw no shortage of tritium, one of two
nuclear weapons materials produced at Savannah River. The facility,
the only nuclear weapons plant on active status, also produces
plutonium, which does not decay as quickly as tritium and is said
to be in abundant supply.
   ``We are comfortable that Savannah River will operate at a
sufficient level to meet the tritium needs of the future,'' Salgado
said.
   The news conference was called to defuse criticism of the Energy
Department not only over the Savannah River plant in Aiken, S.C.,
but also over radioactive contamination at the Rocky Flats plant
northwest of Denver, Colo., and over allegedly lax security at
weapons laboratories in New Mexico and California.
   In related developments Tuesday:
   _President Reagan voiced concern about the nuclear plant safety
problem during a meeting with top Defense and Energy department
officials, chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein said.
   Duberstein quoted Reagan as saying the administration is
``committed to making sure that all safety precautions are taken
and that all rules and regulations be followed.''
   _The chairman of E.I. du Pont Nemours and Co., which operates
Savannah River under contract for the Energy Department, reacted
angrily to claims that company employees had a lax attitude toward
safety. R.E. Heckert said du Pont was ``caught in a political
cross-fire'' between the Energy Department and Capitol Hill.
   _Officials said the shutdown of the Rocky Flats' main plutonium
processing plant on Saturday virtually halted production at the
nuclear weapons plant.
   _Congressional researchers said the Energy Department has
admitted hundreds of visitors from communist and nuclear-sensitive
nations into its nuclear weapons labs at Sandia, Los Alamos and
Livermore without required security checks.
   _Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the cost of cleaning up
radioactive and hazardous waste at Energy Department nuclear
facilities is estimated at $150 billion to $175 billion. He cited
estimates by Energy Department officials and the General Accounting
Office.
   ``It will take 20 years, even if we know how to do the
cleanup,'' Glenn said, adding that ``safety and health matters too
often took a back seat'' to production goals at the department's
nuclear facilities. It was not clear how Glenn, the chairman of the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, made the estimate.
   _A report issued at the Savannah River plant estimated that
cleaning up the facility could cost as much as $6.5 billion. The
estimate, by the GAO, was markedly higher than an earlier Energy
Department forecast of $285 million for cleanup of 69 waste sites
at the plant.
   Herrington and Salgado said most recent criticism of the
department had originated within the department itself during a
safety and environmental campaign started in early 1985.
   ``Our facilities are safer today than they were four years
ago,'' said Herrington. But ``much more needs to be done.''
   Salgado told Congress on Sept. 30 that he hoped to restart one
of the Savannah River facilities, the P-reactor, within 30 to 45
days.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze invited
UNESCO today to create an international scientific group to begin
space research at a controversial radar station in the Soviet Union.
   He said Soviet scientists were ready to establish contacts with
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization to carry out ``peaceful research at an absolutely
peaceful radar installation'' at Krasnoyarsk, 2,000 miles east of
Moscow.
   In a speech Sept. 16, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
proposed that a center for international cooperation in the
exploration of space be set up at the radar station.
   The United States has said the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty it signed with the Soviet Union would permit the Krasnoyarsk
station to be used for space tracking, but contends that evidence
suggests it actually is being used for missile detection and
warning, a violation of the ABM treaty.
   Shevardnadze, on the last day of a three-day official visit to
France, spoke to a special session of UNESCO's governing Executive
Board.
   He said the most important problem facing the 158-nation
Paris-based organization is to prevent the scientific and
technological revolution from alienating people who depend on it to
improve their lives.
   He said it was ``immoral and dangerous,'' particularly for
industrialized nations, to keep developing nations which constitute
a majority in U.N. organizations at the periphery of scientic
development.
   The United States and Britain left the organization respectively
at the end of 1984 and 1985 after charging that UNESCO was overly
political, free-spending and poorly managed. At the time, the
United States called the organization ``a champion of extreme
statist philosophies.''
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union bore a share of the
responsibility for the departure of the two Western nations.
   ``Sometimes we were also acting on the principle of a `tooth for
a tooth' under the pressure of confrontation,'' he said.
   He said ``excessive introduction of ideological dimensions in
UNESCO debates ... undermined the principle of tolerance that is
fundamental to international cooperation.''
   Shevardnadze was welcomed to UNESCO by Director General Federico
Mayor, who said he was sure the United States, Britain and
Singapore, which also left UNESCO, would heed an appeal
Shevardnadze made at the U.N. General Assemly last month to
reconsider.

<HEAD>Students End Occupation at Goddard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLAINFIELD, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A handful of students who occupied an
administration building at Goddard College for nearly two days have
ended their vigil after narrowing a 26-item list of wide-ranging
demands to one.
   The three remaining students ended their blockade on the second
floor of the Community Center on Tuesday. Seven others had left the
building Monday night.
   The final demand agreed to before the protesters ended their
occupation was that the college fully disclose its financial
records, something Goddard President Jack Lindquist said was
already in effect.
   ``It's a funny issue to have as an issue,'' he said. ``Everybody
knows they can come to me for that information. I'm glad it wasn't
ending homelessness in America; that would have been harder to do.''
   After the barricades were removed Tuesday, about 100 students
and faculty met to discuss the issues that had been raised by the
protesters, which ranged from school issues such as increasing
student participation in the college's administration to more
global concerns, such as freeing South African activist Nelson
Mandela and ending homelessness in America.
   Before the barricades were removed, Zenzile Madikinea, a South
African and former Goddard student who organized the protest with
student Dan Abrams, cried softly.
   ``Because we are non-violent and don't want anybody to get hurt,
we are coming down to press all our demands. We care about the
students and respect the process,'' he said.
   Lindquist said the Community Life Committee, composed of
students and faculty, would decide whether any punitive action
would be taken against the students.

<HEAD>CORRECTS spelling of ``irrelevant'' twice in 8th graf, Quayle
testily</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Call it rapprochement. Call it detente. Call
it peace, however fleeting. After weeks in the national spotlight,
Dan Quayle now admits he actually finds the press likable.
   Quayle's new posture with the media assumes that reporters are
merely a bit misguided, not necessarily evil, a notion he expanded
on Tuesday as he posed for a photo opportunity at an Ohio pumpkin
stand.
   The Republican vice presidential nominee bought his press
entourage a bushel of apples, bit into one and admonished: ``Go eat
them. Enjoy it. Change your attitude.''
   The stand was owned by one Jack R. Custer. Not to let an
opportunity slip, one reporter noted to Quayle that it appeared he
was at Custer's Last Stand. The senator laughed.
   ``Why not? We were at Waterloo earlier,'' said another, a
reference to Quayle's remark to a Napoleon, Ohio, rally that
Michael Dukakis wouldn't come there because he ``doesn't want to
meet his Waterloo.''
   Such repartee with the Indiana senator was missing from early
weeks of his campaign, when the candidate was constantly peppered
with questions about his military service, academic record and
personal life. Those questions do pop up from time to time, as do
questions about polls indicating that Quayle is a drag on the
ticket.
   And indeed, when Quayle ventured into the back of his plane to
see reporters recently, he met some of his toughest questions to
date about his parents' support in the past of the John Birch
society.
   Quayle testily denounced the question as ``irrelevant.'' When
the reporter persisted, Quayle finally told him, ``You're
irrelevant.''
   But more often than not, Quayle has been casual and relaxed
around the press since his debate with Lloyd Bentsen, his
Democratic counterpart.
   There have been frequent impromptu visits to the back of the
plane for on-the-record chats and good-natured banter with the
regulars who travel with him.
   There haven't been any formal news conferences since Sept. 15.
They are not Quayle's best format _ he often makes gaffes _ and
they clearly don't fit in with the campaign strategy.
   ``We've had news conferences, not as much as the press would
like,'' concedes David Prosperi, Quayle's press secretary. ``But
our strategy is not to satisfy the press as much as it is to get
our message out.''
   Quayle likes to tell crowds he is a former newspaperman. He once
held a management position at his father's Huntington, Ind.,
newspaper. But he has made no secret of the fact that he feels he
has been treated unfairly by the press since he became the nominee.
   One reporter who rode on Quayle's campaign plane for the first
time Tuesday seemed stunned that the senator and his press corps
were not at war with each other in the air.
   ``You didn't realize what good friends I had until you got on,
did you?'' Quayle said, gesturing round the plane and smiling
broadly.
   ``Wonderful people here. Glowing reports they write about me all
the time. It's the other people that aren't here, they're the ones
that write all those bad things.''
   With perhaps a bit more of his tongue in his cheek, Quayle
explained his seemingly new attitude to the press by saying, ``I
figured out you weren't all that bad.''
   ``I just didn't realize what a friendly bunch of people you are.
The more I get to know you, the more I really like you,'' he told a
group of reporters at a Van Wert, Ohio, stop.
   Since the debate, moreover, Quayle has displayed a fascination
with ``spin,'' the time-honored practice of political aides'
selling reporters their favorable interpretation of a particular
development.
   ``I am Dr. Spin and I want you all to report that,' Quayle told
the traveling press. ``I don't want anybody to say, well, here's
what some campaign aide said about it. You ask me and I'll give you
the answer.''
   During the weekend, Quayle complained to Bush campaign chairman
James A. Baker III about anonymous Bush staffers quoted in news
reports as saying the GOP vice presidential nominee was a liability
and he did not perform well in the debate, according to campaign
sources, who requested anonymity.
   Quayle says his new lightheartedness with reporters comes
because he has simply decided to enjoy his last few weeks on the
campaign trail.
   ``We are going to have a great deal of fun these last few
weeks,'' he said, ``and I am just sort of sitting back and, as they
say, let her rip.''

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief today said
ethnic rallies that ignited nationwide unrest are an example of
couterrevolutionary tendencies running rampant in Yugoslavia,
state-run media reported.
   ``What the counterrevolution in Kosovo has been trying to do
(constitutes) ...the most brutal threat to socialism in
Yugoslavia,'' Stipe Suvar told the ruling Politburos of Yugoslavia
and Kosovo, an autonomous province in the republic of Serbia.
   But he added, ``Anti-socialist, and if you want,
counterrevolutionary tendencies, have grown in all of Yugoslavia so
that the Kosovo reality, in comparison, is not a particularly
isolated phenomenon.''
   Suvar, an ethnic Croat, spoke in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo. His comments were reported by the state-run Tanjug news
agency.
   At a meeting Tuesday, Serbia's Communist Party chief, Slobodan
Milosevic, defended the Kosovo rallies and vowed he would assign
blame for the national crisis during a meeting of national leaders
next week.
   But Milosevic was criticized for failing to condemn calls for
violent solutions to tensions in Kosovo, where Serbs claim
discrimination by the Albanian majority.
   During the Belgrade meeting of the Central Committee of the
Serbian Communist Party, members demanded three Kosovo communists
be ousted from the national Central Committee for failing to
resolve tensions.
   The Belgrade and the Pristina gatherings were key preludes to
the crucial national Central Committee gathering Monday.
   The growing friction between ethnic groups and general
dissatisfaction with the nation's economy has led to widespread
public protests, strikes and political manuevering that add up to
Yugoslavia's most serious social unrest since World War II.
   Milosevic, hailed by Serbs as the heir apparent to the late
President Josip Broz Tito, is expected to have a major showdown
with national party leaders over the Kosovo dispute and the broader
protests over Yugoslavia's economy.
   Milosevic on Tuesday defended the nationalist rallies but said
they should not become a regular practice. The meeting was
broadcast on state radio and television in a break with usual
practice.
   He said Monday's meeting should be ``a confrontation with the
responsibility for the crisis.''
   The Serbian Central Committee, which has more than 100 members,
decided with only six negative votes to demand dismissals of two
ethnic Albanians and one Slav from their Kosovo party posts and
their expulsion from the national Central Committee.
   One of the three is Azem Vlasi, an ethnic Albanian and former
party chief in Kosovo, where predominantly Moslem Albanians make up
90 percent of the population. Most Slavs who live in the province _
Serbs and Montenegrins _ are Christian.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure. The
autonomous provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina, are part of Serbia but
not fully subject to its control.
   The decentralized system of government and collective federal
presidency were devised in Tito's 1974 constitution to prevent one
republic from gaining sway over the others, but has resulted in an
ineffective government.
   Suvar has said broad personnel changes would be made during
Monday's national party meeting.
   Ethnic tension in Kosovo has increased sharply in recent weeks
because of rallies by hundreds of thousands of Serbian
nationalists. Albanians deny discrimination against Slavs and say
the problems are economic.
   Mustafa Sefcet, an ethnic Albanian member of the Serbian Central
Committee, on Tuesday sharply criticized such rally chants as ``We
want arms'' and the calls for Vlasi's death.
   ``These are anti-socialist slogans which do not meet with sharp
condemnation, except for sharp condemnation by all nations and
nationalities'' in regions outside Serbia, he said.
   ``One should, on the spot, unmask all forces standing behind''
the slogans, he said in apparent criticism of Milosevic.
   Belgrade radio reported three more rallies Tuesday. It said
50,000 people demonstrated at Leskovac, 90 miles south of Belgrade;
20,000 massed at nearby Cuprija and another large rally was
reported at Valjevo, 50 miles south of Belgrade.

<TEXT>
   Some 200,000 commuters were derailed this
morning when a broken water main flooded subway tunnels and closed
some streets around a key midtown Manhattan subway hub, officials
said.
   Some sections of the subway system were under eight feet of
water and the water was lapping over some platforms, said Transit
Authority spokesman Bob Slovak.
   The break in the 36-inch main was reported at 2 a.m., said
Martha Holstein, a spokeswoman for the city Department of
Environmental Protection. It took about five hours for city crews
to close three water mains to isolate the break.
   ``It's no longer gushing in the area,'' Holstein said. ``It's
still very wet.''
   The broken main carries water into smaller distribution mains,
which connect to buildings.
   Transit Authority spokesman Bob Previdi said some 200,000
commuters were affected as train service on some lines was halted
for up to four hours before the trains could be rerouted.
   Holstein said water service was expected to be restored to the
affected areas _ between Broadway and Eighth Avenue and 56th and
60th streets, near the southwest corner of Central Park _ within
``a matter of hours.''
   The size of the actual break and its cause had not yet been
determined, she said.
   ``Subway vibrations, heavy traffic, a number of factors can
affect water mains in addition to age or freezing weather, so it's
very unclear what would have caused this,'' she said.
   Motorists were advised to avoid the area, said a police
spokesman, Sgt. Edward Burns.

   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force,

<TEXT>
   Saving historic church buildings is less
important than keeping the parish life within them strong, Cardinal
Edmund C. Szoka said in defense of a plan to close 43 Catholic
churches in the city.
   Szoka predicted Tuesday that parishioners' unhappiness with the
planned closings would decrease.
   ``As people have time to think about this and to consider it,
they'll understand that what we're trying to do is to strengthen
the life of the parishes, strengthen the presence of the church in
the city,'' he said.
   ``That's always been our objective. We can't confuse that with
simply maintaining a lot of great big buildings that once served a
purpose but today are not needed.''
   A preservationist said many of the structures deserved to be
saved as landmarks, even if not as houses of worship.
   ``I would say throughout the Northeast and the Midwest, there is
a widespread recognition that the Roman Catholic Church especially
cannot afford to keep that number of buildings,'' said Holly Fiala.
   Fiala, Midwest director of the Chicago-based National Trust for
Historic Preservation, and other representatives of local, state
and federal preservation agencies, met in Detroit on Monday to
discuss the historic significance of churches the Archdiocese of
Detroit plans to close.
   ``Some of these are very great energy-using buildings, and the
population that supports them has been reduced,'' Fiala said. ``For
the large barns of buildings meant to house 4,000 parishioners and
that now have 400, it's a real problem.''
   As many as half of the 43 threatened churches may be eligible
for designation as landmarks under Detroit's historic landmark
ordinance, said William M. Worden, staff director of Detroit's
Historic Designation Advisory Board.
   The historic designation would restrict interior and exterior
renovations, he said. State and national historic designations are
also possible, a status already attained by 10 of the affected
buildings.
   ``It may delay the demolition of the building or its conversion
to an alternate use ... but it will not keep their parish alive,''
Fiala said. ``That is something separate and apart from what the
designation can achieve. It basically protects the building itself,
but it doesn't protect what happens inside. That is a local issue.''

   The United States has provided 142 aircraft to
other countries over the last decade for the interception and
eradication of illegal drugs, the State Department said today.
   More than half went to Mexico. ``Facing growing violence from
cocaine traffickers in their own countries, the governments of
Latin America are fighting back,'' the department said in a
statement.
   These countries are building rural mobile police units,
eradicating coca plantations and looking for new crops for peasant
growers, it said.
   ``The U.S. government is working with a number of Latin American
governments to build up their own capabilities for eradication and
interdiction,'' the statement issued by the press office said. ``We
are committed to helping these governments and will continue to
provide training and equipment.''
   Two years ago, Congress required that U.S. airplanes and
helicopters used on anti-drug missions remain udner U.S. ownership.
The statement issued today was in response to inquires prompted by
an account by the Knight-Ridder news service.
   State Department officials said on Tuesday that Bolivia had
mounted machine guns on six U.S. helicopters under a drug-fighting
contract with the Pentagon while Peru and Guatemala have hired
American civilian pilots.
   Americans are flying five helicopters in Peru and two aircraft
to spray fields in Guatemala, the officials said.
   The disclosure followed the Knight-Ridder story that said the
State Department had amassed a force of 150 aircraft and planned to
use U.S. civilian pilots to fly armed missions against drug traders
in Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley called the story an
``exaggeration.'' She and Catherine Shaw of the department's
International Narcotics Office then disclosed the Pentagon contract
with Bolivia and the hiring of civilian pilots in Peru and
Guatemala.
   But Mrs. Oakley said the 29 helicopters and planes acquired on
order to combat drugs ``are not for combat. They are not used for
aggressive actions like bombing airstrips or cocaine laboratories.
I am not aware of plans for their future use in that regard.''
   In all, 16 U.S. helicopters and planes are in South American
countries to combat drugs, the officials said. But except for the
six helicopters in Bolivia, none has weapons mounted aboard, Mrs.
Oakley said.
   She said, however, that local law enforcement agents may be
carrying weapons aboard those aircraft.
   The Knight-Ridder story identified Ann B. Wrobleski, the
assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters,
as ``commander in chief of the air wing.''
   Aides to Mrs. Wrobleski said she was attending an international
drug conference in The Hague that was not open to the press and
could not be reached for comment.
   Mrs. Oakley called the story ``an exaggeration and an
overdramatization of the congressional mandated role of the
department'' in combating drugs.
   The six helicopters in Bolivia are Huey models, each one able to
carry a crew of three and eight passengers. The M60 machine guns
are mounted in doorways on swivels.
   Ms. Shaw of the international narcotics office said Bolivia
armed the helicopters under a contract with the Defense Department.
   In all, she said, the United States has title to 29 helicopters
and planes in the anti-drug wing, not the 150 reported by
Knight-Ridder.
   Of these, Ms. Shaw said, five Bell helicopters have been
delivered to Peru, six Hughes helicopters to Bolivia, a C123 Cargo
plane to Peru, two agricultural spray planes to Guatemala and two
to Colombia.
   She said the two in Colombia may be flown by American civilians,
as well, but she was not certain.
   Two other planes are used for training, while the others in the
wing of 29 will be delivered later, the State Department official
said.
   Congress authorized $55 million for the operation. Under a 1986
law, the United States must maintain title to the planes.
Previously, American planes would be turned over to other countries
to use in their campaigns against narcotics.

   Immigration agents say they found 91
people crammed inside a stuffy, three-bedroom house and garage
believed to be used by smugglers of illegal aliens to imprison
those who couldn't pay the smuggling fee.
   All of the people were arrested, including 14 booked for
investigation of taking money from illegal immigrants in exchange
for transporting them into the United States, authorities said
Tuesday.
   The immigrants, found Sunday, were being held captive because
they had not paid the smugglers their passage fee of $250 to $500
each, said Tom Gaines, an assistant district director of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   People stood by entrances to keep the aliens from escaping, he
said. He declined to given more details about the smuggling ring
and his operations.
   Nearly all the immigrants were Mexican men, but a young family
was among those taken away in the Sunday morning raid, authorities
and witnesses said. ``What really broke my heart was to see what
appeared to be a mother, a father and three kids,'' said Donna
Gimondo, a neighbor who watched the INS raid.
   ``One kid was about 3 to 6 months old and (the mother) had him
cuddled in a blanket. One was about 2{ to 3 years old and the
oldest was a 4-year-old boy. ... All were crying.''

   The military says it got just one false positive
result in testing more than 135,000 recruits for the AIDS virus,
lending support to those who favor widespread screening for the
disease.
   The armed forces, which routinely screen all recruits for
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, had only one false positive in
checking young men and women from areas where the AIDS virus is
rare.
   The results of the military testing program are to be published
Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   The risk of false positive results is often cited as an argument
against routinely screening people at low risk of AIDS infection,
such as marriage license applicants. Some have suggested that the
false positives might actually outnumber those who are truly
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus.
   Dr. Robert R. Redfield of the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research said the military program dispels that ``myth'' by showing
that AIDS testing can be performed quickly, cheaply and accurately.
The test costs the government $3 per person, and the results are
available within three days.
   Military researchers said not all AIDS testing may be as
accurate and efficient as theirs.
   ``Clearly, people who perform the test poorly will have bad
results,'' Redfield said. ``I would like Americans to ask why the
young men and women in the Department of Defense get an early
diagnosis for a treatable, preventable disease, when they can't.
The answer is there has been no leadership in the medical community
to provide that right to the American people.''
   One critic of widespread testing, Dr. Lawrence Miike of the
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, said the report
shows that ``you can get this phenomenally high accuracy rate,
which probably surpasses every other test there is.''
   ``But I'm not worried about them,'' he said. ``I'm worried about
labs that advertise, `Come get your HIV test.' I get calls from
people who say they are the victims of false positives.''
   ``The question is not how well the best laboratories can do,''
added Dr. Klemens B. Meyer of New England Medical Center in Boston.
``The issue is how well most laboratories are performing, whether
they will maintain this performance and whether it is good enough.''
   Many experts agree that AIDS testing is sufficiently accurate
when used among people who are at increased risk of the disease,
such as homosexual men or drug addicts.
   To learn how well it works among people at low risk, military
researchers reviewed 20 months of testing of recruits from rural
parts of 36 states with low AIDS rates.
   Their initial check of the blood of 135,187 recruits showed that
15 were infected. When they re-examined the blood of these 15 with
four different tests, they found that one of them was actually free
of the AIDS virus. The 14 others were in fact infected.
   During the study, the HIV infection rate among the total 1.2
million recruits was 1.48 per 1,000 people. The military doctors
said their latest work suggests that among these people, there was
one false positive result for every 200 truly positive ones.
   Redfield said the military testing has improved, and false
positives are now probably about one in 1 million.
   In the military program, blood is initially screened with a
quick, easy test called an ELISA. If it's found to be positive for
the virus, it's checked again with the same test.
   All blood that turns up positive in both tests is re-examined
with a more time-consuming test called a Western blot. If that
shows the blood to be infected, a new sample is drawn from the
recruit. If this also turns out to be positive on a Western blot,
the recruit is considered to be infected with the AIDS virus.
   Redfield said he believes that AIDS testing should be routinely
performed in venereal disease clinics, in drug addiction programs,
during pregnancy exams and when people are admitted to hospitals.

   The five veteran astronauts who
flew Discovery into space say the most anxious moments of their
nearly flawless flight came during liftoff, a ``very long 8{
minutes'' as they remembered the fate of the Challenger.
   Pilot Richard Covey said Tuesday that although he had flown
before, he still was ``a bit taken aback'' by the power of the
rockets that thrust the shuttle into orbit Sept. 29.
   ``It was a very, very long 8{ minutes'' until the main engine
cut off, Covey said during the crew's first post-flight news
conference at the Johnson Space Center. ``I think we all felt that
way.''
   ``I'm sure we were all thinking, to some degree, about the fact
that the last time this had been attempted, it wasn't successful.
You never forget that,'' he said.
   The Challenger explosion, which occurred 73 seconds after
liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, and killed all seven astronauts aboard,
was blamed on a faulty booster rocket. The rockets were redesigned
and NASA officials have found no damage in the new boosters.
   Despite the anxious moments, Discovery's astronauts praised the
shuttle's performance and its success in putting Americans back
into space.
   ``We can look back on a flight that as far as I'm concerned was
picture perfect,'' said Discovery commander Frederick Hauck, who
announced the mission would be his last. Hauck, a Navy captain,
said he is considering what he will do next, but said he has not
resigned from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``I don't think we have any ghosts hovering above us anymore,''
Hauck said, referring to doubts cast on the space agency because of
the Challenger explosion.
   During an appearance today on ``CBS This Morning,'' Covey was
asked how NASA was changed by the Discovery mission.
   ``I think the main changes we've seen within NASA are a
commitment to quality, a commitment to safety that we didn't have
quite as much emphasis on prior to the Challenger accident and an
increase in communications between all the elements of NASA,''
Covey said.
   During the four-day mission, Hauck, Covey, John M. Lounge, David
C. Hilmers and George D. ``Pinky'' Nelson deployed a $100 million
communications satellite, tested shuttle systems and conducted 11
experiments before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on
Oct. 3.
   Although a detailed account of the mission showed a few minor
problems, including trouble with a cooling system, the only
complaint the astronauts had Tuesday concerned the bulky pressure
suits worn during launch and landing.
   While watching a 20-minute film about the flight that included
shots of the astronauts getting into the 75-pound suits before
landing, Nelson said, ``It hurts just to watch it.''
   Nelson said that although the suits, which are part of a new
escape system, are ``pretty uncomfortable,'' a few modifications
such as a better fan and a less bulky harness could improve them.
   During the mission, Discovery's crew members broadcast an
emotional message in memory of the seven Challenger astronauts
while a camera on the shuttle showed a view of the Earth.
   Hilmers, who came up with the memorial, said he wanted those on
the ground to see the pictures of Earth to help understand why
others want to travel in space.
   ``I thought at that time we were really linked closely
together,'' he said. ``I felt a lot closer (to the Challenger
victims) then than maybe ever before. We really wanted to show the
world that we were standing up there for them and their sacrifice
wasn't in vain.''

<HEAD>Norway's Violation Of Export Rules Damaged NATO Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KONGSBERG, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway's defense chief and one of its
top computer engineers testified that the sale of Norwegian
technology to the Soviet Union undermined NATO security.
   Gen. Vigleik Eide said Tuesday that the Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk,
in a joint venture with Toshiba Machines Co. of Japan, exported
computerized control systems for milling machinery that allowed the
Soviets to speed up their production of silent submarine
propellers. The general said the state-of-the art technology would
make it more difficult to detect the vessels.
   He made the statements at the trial of Bernard John Green, a
Briton who was the sales manager at Kongsberg and who signed the
contracts that violated Western export regulations to East bloc
countries.
   Green, who has lived in Norway since 1975, pleaded innocent to
charges of lying on the export licence application for the sale. He
argued that the sale, completed between 1983 and 1985, was a
collective decision by the company. Green, 50, faces a maximum
2{-year prison term if convicted.
   Eide said the technology enabled the Soviets ``to more quickly
equip old and new submariness with such propellers. From 1984 to
1987 the Soviets produced 50 propellers with low noise level.
   ``This weakened our possibilities of detecting subs and reduced
our capability of drawing the right military conclusions in times
of crisis. Norway's security was damaged,'' Eide said.
   Norway is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
of the Paris-based Coordination Committee for Multinational Export
Control (COCOM), which regulates trade with the Soviet bloc.
   The Norwegian-Japanese joint venture involved the export of
milling machinery with nine axes, which violated COCOM regulations
that only allowed export of two-axes machine tools.
   Oeyvind Bjoerke, who developed high-tech data systems for the
Norwegian company, told the court he knew the sale violated COCOM
rules and that he discussed it with the company employees.
   But Bjoerke said the Soviets could have acquired similar
technology from other sources.
   ``They would not have gotten the very best equipment, but other
equipment would not have prevented them from producing the silent
propellers they needed. They may just have needed a little more
time,'' he said.
   When the Toshiba-Kongsberg deal was disclosed last year it put a
strain on U.S.-Norwegian relations, and Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland apologized to President Reagan.
   At the time of the sale, Norway had no law to punish those who
violated COCOM rules, but Parliament imposed stricter controls last
year.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. attorney's office today sued state and
local water resources agencies, seeking to force them to end
pollution of the Everglades and Lake Okeechobee.
   The five-count federal complaint says the agencies have failed
to protect water quality and prevent water pollution as required by
state and federal law.
   ``Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades are unique environmental
treasures,'' said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen. ``The continued
degradation of the Everglades is a national tragedy.''
   The suit was filed against the South Florida Water Management
District, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation and
the heads of those agencies.
   Lehtinen said the lawsuit seeks to stop water pollution
throughout the Kissimmee-Okeechobee-Everglades water system, since
pollution gathered by the system ends up in a national park and a
national wildlife refuge.
   Okeechobee, the nation's largest fresh-water lake outside of the
Great Lakes, has for years been receiving pollution, much of it in
the form of nutrient-laden runoffs from dairy farms along the
Kissimmee River Valley. The river, flowing from south of the
Orlando area, is a primary source of water for the lake.
   In turn, water from the lake flows into the Loxahatchee National
Wildlife Refuge, into Everglades National Park and to the
water-conservation areas that recharge the Biscayne aquifer,
southeastern Florida's primary water supply.
   Both state and federal laws are violated by allowing large
quantities of polluted water to enter the protected areas, Lehtinen
said.
   The state and the self-governing water district failed to
maintain legal water quality standards, operated pumps without a
permit and violated their contracts to supply clean water to the
national parks, the suit claims.
   Lehtinen stressed that the Everglades park provides sanctuary to
rare and endangered species of wildlife, including the Florida
panther, southern bald eagle, woodstork, American crocodile and
Cape Sable sparrow.
   The park requires low-nutrient, non-polluted water for the
survival of the species, he said, adding that without immediate
action, ``more and more wetlands will be lost.''

   The FBI has ended its monthlong investigation
into allegations of a 1978 baby swap at a rural Florida hospital,
saying there was no evidence any federal laws were violated, an
agency spokesman said.
   ``We closed our case,'' FBI spokesman Russ Wood said Tuesday.
``Preliminary investigation failed to establish that there was a
violation of federal criminal statutes.''
   Wood declined to give details of the inquiry.
   The Pennsylvania couple who sought the probe, Ernest and Regina
Twigg, can ask state law enforcement officers to investigate, the
federal spokesman said, adding, ``That option is always available.''
   The Twiggs claim their newborn was stolen at Hardee Memorial
Hospital in Wauchula nearly 10 years ago. Mrs. Twigg maintains that
she gave birth to a healthy girl, but hospital workers sent her
home with a sickly child, then altered records to hide the swap.
   The couple say genetic blood tests this summer revealed that
Arlena, the child they raised, was not their real daughter. Arlena
suffered from a heart defect and died following surgery Aug. 23,
never knowing that doubts had been raised about her parentage.
   Last month, the Twiggs filed a $100 million suit against the
hospital and some of its employees and persuaded the FBI to
investigate to see if federal kidnapping laws had been violated.
   Records show that during its probe the FBI subpoenaed documents
from the hospital, and interviewed the Twiggs. They also talked
with the father of a Sarasota girl who the Twiggs claim was the
only other white girl born at Hardee Memorial during the time Mrs.
Twigg gave birth.
   The girl has not been identified to protect her from publicity.
   LaVonna Vice, one of the lawyers representing the Twiggs, said
she doesn't know why the federal investigation ended, but
speculated that it might show the child the Twiggs claim was stolen
was not taken out of Florida.
   Federal kidnapping law generally applies to victims taken across
state line. However, the law also states that keeping a victim more
than a day creates ``a rebuttal presumption'' that the victim was
transferred over state lines.
   The father of the 9{-year-old Sarasota girl said he doesn't know
what to think about the FBI departure from the case. He said he
cooperated with the agency and provided them with polygraph tests
results showing he knew nothing about an alleged swap. He claims
the Twiggs, of Langhorne, Pa., are wrong about his daughter's
identity.

<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd pleaded
with his colleagues today to complete work quickly on the $2.6
billion drug bill, and restrain themselves from trying to be ``the
John Wayne in the drug war.''
   Byrd, D-W.Va., indicated that Democratic and Republican
lawmakers have so far been unable to try to pare down the more than
100 amendments that may be introduced. Meetings were continuing,
but it was uncertain whether the Senate would begin debate on the
election-year bill today.
   Speaking on the Senate floor, Byrd cautioned senators against
introducing amendments aimed at ``trying to indicate who can be the
toughest, who can be the John Wayne in the drug war.
   ``We can all be tough, but we've got a good tough bill,'' he
said.
   The legislation would provide additional federal money for
treatment programs, new law enforcement officers and prisons. It
also would allow capital punishment for certain drug offenders who
commit murder, and toughen penalties for drug dealers who sell
their wares to children.
   The wide-ranging measure would distribute 60 percent of its
money to prevention and treatment programs, and 40 percent to law
enforcement.
   Even though the legislation is the joint product of Democrats
and Republicans, there are some lawmakers who want to strengthen
it, others who want to water it down and still others who wish to
attach unrelated language to it because it could be the last bill
Congress passes this year.
   Senators are ready to introduce amendments that would strip the
death penalty provision from the measure, limit the ability of
prisoners to appeal their sentences on technical grounds, permit
courts to accept some illegally seized evidence and force states to
conduct drug tests on drivers license applicants.
   Other amendments would apply sanctions against South Africa and
require containers of alcohol to carry warning labels. By some
counts, there are more than 100 amendments waiting in the wings.
   The clock is a factor because Congress is hoping to adjourn for
the year at week's end. For the last several days, some senators
and their aides have been trying to see if there is any way to
limit the number of amendments that would be offered.
   The House passed a strong version of the bill Sept. 22
containing the death penalty, but bearing many other tough
proposals the Senate bill lacks.
   One important provision that is absent from both is a mechanism
for paying for the programs created in the bill. Even though $1.4
billion is supposed to be spent in fiscal year 1989 _ which began
Oct. 1 _ legislators say the government only has $450 million left
in its coffers. The Senate has so far voted down efforts to raise
taxes or cut other spending programs to provide the missing $950
million.
   Even if the Senate passes a bill, House-Senate negotiators will
have to agree to a compromise version before it can be sent to
President Reagan for his signature.

   A mild earthquake woke up some residents
early today and rattled a few windows, but there were no reports of
damage, officials said.
   The quake struck at 5:47 a.m. and measured 3.2 on the Richter
scale, according to the University of California Seismographic
Station. Its epicenter was about seven miles east of San Jose.
   ``It creaked a little and lasted three or four seconds,'' said
KCBS newsman Ken Bastida, whose office is on the 12th floor of a
downtown building.
   ``There was a slight shudder and that was it,'' said a city
telephone dispatcher who did not want to give her name. ``I wasn't
even sure it was an earthquake until the news people called.''
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number on the scale represents a
tenfold increase in the magnitude of an earthquake.
   A quake with a magnitude of 4.0 is capable of causing moderate
damage, while a quake of 6.0 can cause severe damage.

<TEXT>
   President Gustav Husak today
appointed a new government after the premier and his Cabinet
resigned in a shake-up expected to slow the pace of reform.
   Husak appointed a new 20-member government, including Ladislav
Adamec to replace Lubomir Strougal as the federal premier, the
state-run CTK news agency said. The appointments amounted to a
rubber stamp of selections made Tuesday by the Communist Party's
Central Committee.
   Strougal, a key advocate of speedy economic and social reform,
was premier for 18 years. He resigned Monday during a meeting of
the Central Committee and also gave up his seat on the party's
ruling Politburo.
   Adamec, 62, was premier of the Czech Republic, one of the
nation's two republics. He is expected to be less insistent on
speedy reform than Strougal. The Czech Republic's Parliament today
chose Frantisek Pitra to replace Adamec as the republic's premier,
CTK said.
   The new government requires approval by the Federal Assembly, or
parliament, scheduled to meet in November. It was not immediately
clear what became of a caretaker government that was appointed
Tuesday.
   Speeches published after the Central Committee meeting made
clear that party leaders favor reforms but resist radical changes
in the economy, such as tampering with the socialist linchpin _
central planning.
   Warning of the potential for high inflation and unemployment
under rapid reform, the leadership backed personnel changes aimed
at pursuing a slower road to restructuring than that of the Soviets.
   Strougal, 63, was known to have championed thorough economic
reform similar to those being carried out in the Soviet Union under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But Strougal's plans for innovative
changes were watered down by party conservatives.
   Adamec's main advantage appears to be that in the eyes of many
he is not associated with the brutal suppression that occurred
during the so-called ``crisis years'' of 1968-69 when then-party
chief Alexander Dubcek was purged in the wake of a Soviet-led
invasion.
   Party chief Milos Jakes, chief ideologist Jan Fojtik, and a
resolution published Tuesday made it clear that political change
like that in the Soviet Union has been ruled out for some time to
come.
   Fojtik denounced the ``radicalism'' of unidentified people in
Czechoslovakia, who are ``calling for a drastic reform with
bankruptcies and unemployment, rapid growth of prices of
foodstuffs, rents and of inflation.''
   Fojtik told reporters, ``We put emphasis on the leading role of
the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in carrying out the
restructuring process.
   ``The economic reform is aimed at strengthening socialist
ownership relations,'' said Fojtik.
   As he met reporters, Fojtik claimed Strougal does not feel
healthy, is tired and ``is not really able to master the many
difficult task'' of premiership.
   Fojtik indicated that Strougal left the political scene in
anger, saying he will not even head the caretaker government.
   Fojtik and Jakes also stressed that despite some cautious
opening up in the arts, the party remains firmly opposed to
political liberalization, let alone the recognition of dissident
and nonconformist political and ecological groups.
   Without naming countries, the ideologist, who took over the
party portfolio from hard-line Politburo member Vasil Bilak, now in
charge of foreign policy, said Prague leaders are discouraged and
in fact appalled by reform setbacks in Hungary and Poland.
   Fojtik outlined some government changes Tuesday.
   He said Jaromir Johanes, first deputy foreign minister and a
former ambasssador to Canada and the United States, was nominated
to be the new foreign minister, replacing Bohuslav Chnoupek.
   Five new members, ages 43 to 56, were added to the Central
Committee Politburo, and Strougal and Peter Colotka stepped down.
Colotka also resigned as premier of the Slovakia republic.
   CTK said he was replaced by Ivan Knotek, 52, a newcomer to the
Politburo.

   Three people were electrocuted while

authorities said.
   Killed in the accident Tuesday were Shannon Ray Damron, 43, his
son, Wesley, 20, of Marshall, and Elliott Blair, 44, of Albion,
said Calhoun County Sheriff's Deputy Thomas McHale.
   Another son, Shannon Ray Damron II, 22, was admitted to Oaklawn

   The accident occurred outside the elder Damron's home, McHale

   ``They were holding the tower in a near-vertical position and
moving it from one side of the house to the other when it struck a
main power line nearby,'' said McHale.

   Arson investigators probed the third fire in
less than three years at the downtown Central Library, where
hundreds of thousands of books were destroyed in two 1986 arson
blazes.
   Because the building is undergoing extensive renovation, no
books were in the library when the fire broke out Tuesday. However,
authorities feared that smoke from the basement blaze may have
again damaged the structure's huge murals.
   As firefighters wearing air tanks vented smoke from the
62-year-old library, an arson investigator would say only that the
blaze was under investigation.
   ``Three times is a little hard to believe,'' said Librarian
Wyman Jones, surveying the scene after being summoned by Fire Chief
Donald Manning.
   A passer-by reported the fire at 5:17 p.m. and it was declared
extinguished a half-hour later, said Assistant Fire Chief Gerald
Johnson. The blaze was confined to paper and wood construction
material in an 8-by-25-foot basement room.
   The work being done in that room involved removal of ceiling
tiles containing asbestos. The presence of the hazardous material
worried firefighters and prevented library officials from
immediately entering afterward to assess the damage.
   The library has been undergoing a $152 million renovation since
the 1986 blazes, and res31

... last week.</NOTE>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis pitched economic nationalism while
Republican George Bush accused his rival of adopting a
protectionist stance strictly for political gain as the two
presidential candidates fine-tuned their strategy for their second
and final debate.
   The vice president, embarking on a weeklong West Coast swing
highlighted by Thursday's debate in Los Angeles, told business
students at Seattle University on Tuesday that Dukakis opposed
``protectionist demagoguery'' during the Democratic primaries.
``But now, for political reasons, he sees advantage in stoking
fears about foreign influence,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis vowed that the Democratic ticket would be aggressive
advocates for U.S. companies and workers.
   ``Together we can build a future where the best products in the
world are designed by American minds, built by American hands and
produce good profits and good paychecks here on American soil,''
the Massachusetts governor told a partisan crowd at Tufts
University in Medford, Mass.
   Later Tuesday, Dukakis responded to Bush's charges: ``I'm for
more trade, not less trade. I want to export American products, not
American jobs.''
   Like Bush, Dukakis was in California today, conferring with
advisers and doing some last-minute studying of briefing papers for
the nationally broadcast, 90-minute debate, set to begin at 9 p.m.
EDT at Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus.
   Neither candidate planned any campaign appearances today to
devote their time to debate preparation.
   Bush was working with former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard
G. Darman, who was Dukakis' stand-in for a mock debate the vice
president had Saturday, said press secretary Sheila Tate.
   Bush was taking a short break this morning to meet with Los
Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates.
   One final detail for the candidates' face-to-face confrontation
was decided Tuesday when the Bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates selected the moderator and three questioners.
   Ann Compton of ABC, Andrea Mitchell of NBC and Margaret Warner
of Newsweek will quiz the candidates, and Bernard Shaw of Cable
News Network will serve as moderator.
   CBS anchorman Dan Rather declined an invitation to be a panelist.
   The first question will go to Dukakis, and Bush will deliver the
final closing statement _ a reversal of the first debate, said Bob
Neuman, a spokesman for the commission.
   The latest polls indicated that the race remains close, raising
the political stakes for the prime-time debate.
   A Gallup Organization survey showed Bush leading Dukakis 49
percent to 43 percent among 1,007 registered voters questioned
Friday through Sunday, while a Harris Poll of 1,355 likely voters
Thursday through Monday had the lead at only 50 percent to 48
percent. Given the polls' margins of sampling error _ four points
for Gallup and three for Harris _ the race appeared virtually even.
   Among 748 likely voters, Gallup found Bush ahead 52-41 percent,
but the organization stressed the closer result, saying it was too
soon to gauge likelihood of voting.
   As in other polls, Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen was seen as having decisively beaten Republican Dan Quayle
in their debate last week.
   Quayle returned to Indiana on Tuesday to a rousing hometown
reception where he delivered some fighting words for his candidacy
borrowed from the late President Harry S. Truman and Revolutionary
War hero John Paul Jones.
   ``We plan on taking some heat but staying in the kitchen. In the
end, we'll get the job done. We have just begun to fight,'' the
Indiana senator told cheering supporters.
   The crowd erupted when Quayle proclaimed, ``You're looking at
the next vice president of the United States.''
   Quayle was traveling to Rapid City, S.D., and Great Falls,
Mont., later today where he was expected to talk about his role in
co-authoring the 1982 Job Training Partnership Act.
   Bentsen was campaigning this afternoon in Columbia, Mo., and
Fayetteville, Ark.
   The Democratic vice presidential candidate again ridiculed
Bush's selection of Quayle, noting that the GOP nominee has
suggested that in his administration the Indiana senator would head
the drug interdiction effort.
   ``George Bush wants us to follow Dan Quayle into battle,''
Bentsen told a rally at a Philadelphia union hall on Tuesday.
``I'll tell you, I've been in combat, and I'll pass on that one.
   ``If George Bush is serious about being president, why would he
choose Dan Quayle for being vice president?''
   While in Seattle, Bush vowed to crack down on white-collar crime
as he told the university's business students he would ``throw the
book at insider traders and other white-collar criminals.''
   ``They may not carry guns and they may wear fancy suits, but
they are a real danger to society, and they should be hit with the
maximum penalties of the law,'' he said.
   Bush's most pointed attack, however, was on his rival's
protectionist stand.
   ``My opponent needs an issue, and he's willing to scare people
to find it,'' the vice president said.
   Bush's speech at the Roman Catholic college was interrupted by a
Jesuit priest, who was forcibly removed after he shouted his
objections to Reagan administration policies. The priest said he
was given a citation for criminal trespassing.
   Dukakis, in his appearance on a college campus, pledged to
restore American leadership in space and technology and as a result
see the nation take the lead in global markets.
   The Democratic nominee said the GOP ticket was ``satisfied with
today and complacent about tomorrow,'' symbolized by its new theme
song, ``Don't Worry; Be Happy.''

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on the gas-guzzler boom:
   Last week, Secretary of Transportation James H. Burnley
announced that his department had again caved in to the demands of
the country's top two automakers and waived fuel economy
requirements for 1989 automobiles.
   Meanwhile, a new poll suggests that 90 percent of the public
believes government should require automakers to build more
fuel-efficient cars.
   The survey respondents know something the Department of
Transportation apparently doesn't.
   Oil may be cheap and plentiful at the moment, but the situation
can't last. So it makes sense to keep producing more fuel-efficient
cars, and cutting hazardous air pollution in the bargain.
   GM and Ford aren't doing that. Since the Reagan administration
signaled its willingness to agree to any figure the big automakers
came up with, they've put efficiency on the back burner,
strenuously pushing a new generation of ``muscle'' cars, for which
they have little foreign competition.
   That may boost profits in the short term, but makes little sense
in the long run _ precisely the condition the government fuel
standards were supposed to address.

   The Seattle Times on sheltering the homeless:
   The federal government's benign neglect in evaluating surplus
government property that could be suitable for sheltering the
homeless has been given a needed jolt by a United States District
Court judge in Washington, D.C.
   It has been 15 months since Congress passed and President Reagan
signed the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, a piece of legislation
that has been strangled in part by bureaucratic inaction.
   Among other things, the act requires federal agencies to turn
over buildings and land suitable for sorely needed shelters to
local governments and non-profit agencies. Implementation of the
act has lagged ludicrously. ...
   (The judge) lamented:
   ``Pitifully few of the numerous unused federal properties are
being evaluated for their suitability to assist the homeless and
those that are found to be suitable are not being made available.''
   It defies logic that only a dozen surplus federal properties
exist across the country as possible shelters for an estimated 3
million homeless Americans.

   Los Angeles Daily News on George Bush, Michael Dukakis and the
ACLU:
   George Bush may turn out to be the best friend the American
Civil Liberties Union has had since the red-baiting Sen. Joe
McCarthy. Bush has made the ACLU into a cause celebre.
   The day after the first presidential debate, at which Bush
quoted an earlier remark by Michael Dukakis (that the Democratic
presidential nominee is ``a card-carrying member of the ACLU''),
the organization's president told the New York Times that the group
had gotten hundreds of phone calls from people interested in
joining. ...
   Dan Quayle may call the ACLU ``the criminal defendant's best
friend.'' But since people in this country are innocent until
proven guilty, they are allowed a few friends.
   There is no better safeguard in this country against abusive
prosecution than a pack of experienced ACLU lawyers.
   That said, we feel free to censure the other side of the ACLU.
That side is highly political, seemingly paranoid about the
supposed danger of religion in public life and overzealous in
looking for infringements on so-called free speech. ...
   Of course, if anyone is to blame for the superficiality of the
ACLU debate, it is Bush, for ignoring the group's beneficial side,
and Dukakis, for defending the organization as if its politics were
irrelevant.

   Owatonna (Minn.) People's Press on the League of Women Voters'
withdrawal from presidential debate sponsorship:
   Hurrah for the League of Women Voters.
   Rather than putting up with another staged event, the League
withdrew its sponsorship of the second presidential debate of this
campaign.
   The League's decision is the first honest call of this campaign.
Anyone who witnessed the first presidential ``debate'' knows the
candidates were more interested in their appearance than the
substance of their answers.
   The League likened the debates to the ever growing list of
campaign charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and honest
answers to tough questions. We wholeheartedly agree.
   This campaign has been one staged event after another. Enough is
enough. It's time for the candidates to put the issues before their
wardrobes.
   Maybe the League's decision will bring these candidates back
into the real world _ not the one their campaign advisers have
carefully staged these past few months.
   Certainly, the voters deserve as much.

   Waco (Texas) Tribune-Herald on the vice presidential debate:
   By all criteria _ style or substance _ Lloyd Bentsen was a
lopsided winner in (the) vice presidential debate. Dan Quayle's
only claim was that he was still standing. Call it a technical
knockout.
   Sure, Bentsen overplayed the need for a ``tough'' trade policy
(a trade war perhaps?) as a miracle cure for the American economy.
But in other policy matters _ like welfare reform, the environment
and defense burden-sharing by American allies _ he was resonant.
   Bentsen was perhaps most convincing in explaining that he can
differ in degree with Michael Dukakis. On Contra aid (which he
favors and Dukakis opposes), Bentsen criticized the Reagan
administration for banking so heavily on military force that
regional diplomacy is disregarded outright.
   Bentsen was also right on the shaky foundations of Reaganomics _
an economy propped up by foreign debt and deficit spending (``$200
billion in hot checks''). Quayle was left to give a testimonial to
foreign entrepreneurs.
   Dukakis still has a lot of convincing to do to show his mettle
as a leader, but Bentsen's performance helps him a lot.
   The senator from Texas came off as a real Dukakis asset _ a man
of competence and moderation.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on prison furloughs:
   Some good is coming out of the presidential race. Michael
Dukakis' defense of a furlough program for felons is causing such
programs to undergo closer examination by the general public.
   It is insane to allow violent criminals to roam free before they
complete their prison sentences. Such releases needlessly place the
law-abiding public in jeopardy.
   The Willie Horton case (in Massachusetts) is a good example of
this. Not only was Horton bad news before he was convicted, he
violated prison rules while inside. The administration that allowed
this man to be freed is out-and-out incompetent.
   It was also wrong of Circuit Judge Larry Starcher to end due
process and capriciously free 56 inmates from the Huttonsville
(W.Va.) prison in 1986. Already, seven of those men have returned
to prison _ for crimes that wouldn't have been committed had they
been behind bars, where judges and juries sent them.
   Efforts to alleviate prison crowding need to be a little more
careful than this. These experiments have endangered the civil
rights of innocent citizens _ both in West Virginia and
Massachusetts.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on banning chlorofluorocarbons:
   Even as a 46-nation treaty calling for a 50 percent reduction in
manufacuture of ozone depleting chemicals comes close to going into
effect, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is
saying that isn't enough. EPA Administrator Lee Thomas wants
complete elimination.
   He's right. If the danger is as dire as Thomas says _ and there
seems little reason to doubt him _ the treaty should be amended.
   The United States should lead the way with legislation
establishing a timetable for a complete ban in this country on the
manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that are
believed to be breaking down the ozone layer high above the Earth.
   The elimination of chlorofluorocarbons and the development of
acceptable substitutes should proceed apace. Destruction of the
ozone layer, which screens out ultraviolet rays that are harmful to
health, is too dreadful to contemplate.

   The (Baltimore) Sun on the Soviet leadership shakeup:
   By solidifying his grasp on the Kremlin apparatus and conferring
on himself the trappings as well as substance of power, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev comes to resemble more closely the Soviet dictators whose
mistakes he vows to undo.
   To combat the terrifying legacy of Josef Stalin, become the next
Stalin. To stamp out the stultifying cult of Leonid Brezhnev's
personality, raise Mikhail S. Gorabachev onto the pedestal.
   It is not really so surprising. Gorbachev is a Russian and a
Communist. If he sends journalistic lances to prick the balloons of
Stalin's reputation, there is no debunking Vladimir I. Lenin. The
sources and legitimacy of power as Gorabachev exercises them are
those that Lenin erected. ...
   There is no doubting Gorbachev's desire to liberate the
creativity of the Soviet peoples by freeing them from red tape and
shackles of inherited practice. ...
   In the interest of economic productivity, at the base of state
and political power, he clearly intends reforms and liberations
that have a greater-than-economic dimension, extending into the
intellectual and even spiritual spheres, however distasteful some
of that may be to Gorbachev himself.
   But to impose this on fourth generaton bureaucrats, the party
functionaries raised by Brezhnev for their limited vision and
unlimited loyalty, Gorbachev requires unhindered cooperation at the
top, unbrooked by opposition. ...
   Diversity, pluralism, separation and balance of powers, whatever
their virtue lower in the hierarchies, still have no place in the
summit of Soviet power. The general secretary proceeds as his
predecessors have. He knows no other way.

   Independence (Kan.) Daily Reporter on the release of a hostage
in Lebanon:
   The release of one hostage in Lebanon has made inevitable a
spate of more or less informed surmise about when others may be
freed.
   Inevitable, too, has been speculation as to a) whether the
action resulted from a secret administration deal with Iran to let
a hostage go before the election, and b) whether we can expect an
``October surprise'' meant to influence the election's outcome.
   As to when other hostages may be released, the short answer is
that no one can confidently say.
   The Iranians may be trying to sway American voters, but this is
not certain.
   Overt activity by the administration that might be interpreted
as ``dealing with terrorists'' can probably be ruled out.

   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on withdrawal of the minimum wage
bill:
   A Republican-led filibuster against legislation to raise the
minimum wage recently forced withdrawal of the bill from
consideration.
   The same day the Republican filibuster prevailed, the Senate
Budget Committee's Democratic staff released a damning report on
jobs and wages. The report showed that half of the new jobs created
over the past nine years don't pay enough to keep a family of four
above the poverty level.
   Republicans ... did introduce a cynical substitute to the
Democratic bill: creation of a subminimum wage to be paid certain
workers, mostly teen-agers, during their first three months on the
job.
   Its purpose was not clear, unless it was to suggest that
teen-agers don't need _ or don't deserve _ the minimum wage. It
that sounds reasonable, look around at various fast food outlets
that employ mostly teen-agers. They are having to pay more than
minimum wage just to attract and retain those employees.
   Through their filibuster, the Republicans reiterated support for
their familiar ``trickle down'' theory. In this case, the only
thing trickling down was contempt for the least fortunate in
America's work force.

   The Milwaukee Journal on traffic problems at Chicago airports:
   Reacting to a growing number of mistakes by air traffic
controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration last week cut
peak-hour landings at Chicago's two major airports, O'Hare and
Midway. ...
   O'Hare has a dismal record of controller efficiency. The airport
has been the subject of three investigations by the National
Transportation Safety Board in the last two years.
   The board's most recent report, two months ago, said among other
things that controllers at O'Hare are undertrained and overworked.
That suggests part of the remedy: hiring and training more
controllers.
   But that will take time and money. Fortunately, there is a
quicker, cheaper remedy to Chicago's airline congestion: greater
use of Milwaukee's Mitchell Airport.
   This up-to-date airport can be reached almost as quickly from
some of Chicago's northern suburbs as Midway, or even O'Hare. And
passengers are less apt to be stuck in a holding pattern at or over
Mitchell because it is underused.

<HEAD>Cabinet Minister Suggests Electronic Tags To Reduce Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet minister in charge of law
and order today suggested crime could be reduced by putting
electronic tags on people freed on bail and by widening a ban on
drinking outdoors.
   Britain's crime rate dominated debate on the second day of the
Conservative Party's annual convention in the southern coastal
resort of Brighton.
   The convention has been marked by massive security. When the
governing party last met in Brighton in 1984, a bomb planted by the
Irish Republic Army killed five people and narrowly missed the
prime minister.
   Government statistics in March indicated a 12 percent increase
in muggings and other violent crime in England and Wales last year
and an 11 percent increase in sexual offenses.
   About 3.9 million crimes were reported to police in England and
Wales in 1987, up 45,000 from 1986.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member in charge of law
and order, said the government would attack crime with more police
officers, a possible widening of the public drinking ban, and the
electronic tagging system.
   But Hurd once again rejected capital punishment, saying ``don't
let's get stuck just in this groove.''
   ``Capital punishment can't be the answer to all crime, or even
to violent crime in general,'' he said.
   Capital punishment was abolished in Britain in 1969, but an
overwhelming majority of Conservative delegates raised their hands
in favor of its reinstatement in an unofficial convention poll.
   Hurd said that if the experiment with electronic tagging works,
it could be expanded to monitor the movements of convicted
offenders.
   ``The apparatus is relatively simple,'' Hurd explained. ``It
looks like an electronic bicycle clip, and it works. ... If this
project proves successful then we shall take the idea further.''
   Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the socialist opposition Labor
Party, on Tuesday condemned Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
philosophy of individual self-reliance and her determination to
reduce what she calls the dependency culture based on state aid.
   ``The idea that the Tories are the party of law and order is
clearly nonsense,'' Hattersley said.
   ``The new Tory philosophy openly undermines the rule of law. It
is openly the party of callous individualism... Mrs. Thatcher's
values and Mrs. Thatcher's example lie at the heart of our
increasingly violent society. It is Mrs. Thatcher who has
encouraged the cult of selfishness,'' he charged.
   Legislator Teddy Taylor, a leading law and order activist on the
right wing of the Conservative Party, called at a fringe meeting in
Brighton on Tuesday for a ``crusade on crime'' backed by stiffer
penalties and deterrents.
   ``After nine years of Conservative government, people are
entitled to say the time has come for decisive action,'' he said.

   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle said today he was ``not mad at anybody in the Bush
campaign'' but would take a greater role in running his own
campaign from now on.
   ``I am my own handler,'' Quayle told reporters as he left
Indianapolis. ``If you have any questions, ask me.''
   Quayle had previously expressed irritation at unidentified Bush
aides who have been quoted anonymously as saying he was a liability
to the GOP ticket.
   The Indiana senator complained about the sniping over the
weekend to Bush campaign chairman James Baker III. But Quayle said
there was no animosity between him and top campaign officials.
   ``I'm not mad at anybody in the Bush campaign,'' he said. ``I'm
going to coordinate with them. They're going to suggest things that
I say, suggesting that I do, and I'm going to take that under
consideration.''
   Quayle said he did not anticipate any campaign staff changes,
but ``if I can find any of those leakers ... I think there will be
staff changes.''
   He described his conversation with Baker as cordial and said
reporters would hear him ``say what's on my mind'' in the future.
   Quayle ended a successful Midwestern campaign swing Tuesday with
a promise in his home state to keep on fighting.
   ``We plan on taking some heat but staying in the kitchen. In the
end, we'll get the job done. We have just begun to fight,'' Quayle
shouted as supporters cheered.
   To the partisan crowd, the Indiana senator could do no wrong,
although Dukakis supporters mounted a small protest outside the
rally site. Quayle has said he expects to be a prime target of the
Democrats and that he is happy to be the ``lightning rod'' for the
campaign.
   Quayle travels to South Dakota and Montana today as he makes his
way west.
   But his reception probably won't top the one he received here,
where supporters cheered wildly as he stood before them and said,
``You're looking at the next vice president of the United States.''
   ``Welcome home, Dan,'' they shouted as he worked the crowd,
shaking hands while a band played ``Back Home In Indiana.''
   The welcome did not extend to reporters traveling with Quayle.
The crowd chanted ``Just say no!'' as the press entourage arrived.
   Indiana was the scene of one of the more notorious news
conferences of the Quayle campaign as he and George Bush held a
rally in Quayle's hometown of Huntington the day after the
Republican convention.
   Reporters were booed and denounced with shouts of ``BOR-ing'' as
they tried to question Quayle about his National Guard service.
   Tuesday's campaign events had a vastly more calming tone than
that day in August. Quayle rode through Ohio on a winding bus tour
through pastoral farm land, attacking Democrat Michael Dukakis as
soft on crime, one of the Republicans' favorite themes.
   Quayle was portrayed by speaker after speaker as a ``son of the
heartland'' and he told flag-waving crowds that their staunch
Midwestern values would be preserved under a George Bush presidency.
   ``Right and wrong is at the very core of life in this beloved
Midwest region that I grew up in and where you live,'' he said.
``The values of this region have not left me.''
   He spoke of the importance of Ohio, which has 23 electoral votes
and is viewed as a swing state in November.
   And in Napoleon, Ohio, Quayle delivered the campaign's response
to the Democratic presidential candidate's outrage at the way the
Bush-Quayle ticket was portraying the Massachusetts furlough
program and the escape of convicted murderer Willie Horton Jr., who
attacked a Maryland couple while on the lam.
   Dukakis had said during the weekend that he resented being
portrayed as insensitive to the plight of crime victims, and noted
that members of his own family had been victimized in the past.
Dukakis also noted that people such as Horton, who had been
sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole, could
not be furloughed under current state law.
   But Quayle took issue with Dukakis' defense of what Quayle said
was his ``sorry record of dealing with violent crime.''
   ``He has not truly and sincerely owned up to his irresponsible
conduct,'' Quayle said.

   American FBI agents seized $6 million
worth of paintings during a reent search of the estate of Ferdinand
Marcos' son-in-law in California, a senior Philippine official said
today.
   Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, told reporters he expects U.S. authorities to turn over
the paintings to the Philippine government because they know the
works of art were bought ``with the Filipino people's money.''
   In a related development, Caparas said Marcos, ousted president
of the Philippines, could still face criminal charges in the
Philippines even if he enters a plea bargain with U.S. authorities
and surrenders some of his fortune.
   But Caparas indicated the goverment of President Corazon Aquino
may delay filing criminal charges against Marcos so that U.S.
authorities can procede with their own prosecution of the ousted
president.
   ``Our national interest ... requires that we do not permit our
filing of criminal charges here to be used as an excuse by Mr.
Marcos to escape his indictment abroad,'' said Caparas, speaking on
authority of Mrs. Aquino.
   The move followed reports that State Department legal officer
Abraham Sofaer recommended Marcos be offered a deal under which he
would avoid prison by surrendering millions of dollars he allegedly
embezzled during his 20-year rule. Marcos has not been indicted.
   The possible charges concern allegations of the fraudulent
purchase of real estate and art objects.
   Caparas told reporters the paintings recovered in California
were part of the Samuels Collection, which disappeared from the New
York apartment of Marcos' wife, Imelda.
   Other paintings were recovered in Paris after they were
allegedly smuggled out of the United States by Saudi Arabian
businessman Adnan Khashoggi, a close friend of the Marcoses.
   Marcos and his wife have lived in Hawaii since he was ousted
from power in a civilian-military uprising in February 1986.
   ``I just talked with our lawyer in the United States and he said
that when about 50 agents searched the home of Greggy Araneta, they
found paintings belonging to the Samuels Collection,'' Caparas told
reporters. Araneta and his wife Irene, who is Marcos' daughter,
live in Woodside, a small community south of San Francisco.
   In San Francisco, U.S. attorney Joseph Russoniello said a van
was used to haul away the paintings, sculptures, Ming Dynasty vases
and antique furniture. The raid was carried out by the FBI and
customs and IRS agents under a search warrant.
   The FBI confirmed last week that agents searched the home and
other buildings on Araneta's estate on Thursday.
   ``We expect that (paintings) would be turned over to us like the
paintings that were recovered in France,'' Caparas said. ``We have
long been saying that those paintings were purchased with the
Filipino people's money.''
   Caparas said he was leaving for New York today to look into the
status of four Manhattan buildings allegedly owned by the Marcoses
and which the commission is trying to recover.
   The couple has not admitted ownership of the buildings, which
are now subject to litigation.
   Caparas said he expects to be in New York for three or four
weeks and then will go to Switzerland, where his commission is
trying to recover billions of dollars in secret bank accounts
allegedly belonging to the Marcoses.
   President Corazon Aquino created the commission shortly after
she assumed power in February 1986 to recover billions of dollars
the deposed president and his family and friends allegedly
plundered.
   Filipino officials have filed 39 civil suits against Marcos to
recover $96.7 billion. But no criminal charges have been lodged
against him in the Philippines for fear he might demand his
constitutional right to return home to face his accusers in court.
Philippine law bars criminal trials in absentia but officials fear
his return may spark violence.

   Maoist guerrillas hurled hand grenades
into an army dining hall and then opened fire with submachine guns
and tossed dynamite, killing 12 soldiers and wiping out the
military post, police said.
   Monday's attack was the worst on the military in the guerrillas'
eight-year battle to topple Peru's elected government and impose a
worker-peasant state based on the teaching of China's Mao-Tse Tung.
   In other violence reported Tuesday, police said army troops
killed three Shining Path guerrillas and captured four in a clash
near Chilhua, a village 225 miles southeast of Lima. The clash
occurred Friday.
   In Huancavelica state, two guerrillas disguised as soldiers
entered the mess hall of a small post near Ticrapo and lobbed hand
grenades as troopers sat down to supper Monday evening, Ayacucho
police told The Associated Press.
   A column of 30 Shining Path firing submachine guns and hurling
dynamite then swept through the mess hall and post, shooting
everyone in sight, according to the report.
   Police said 12 soldiers were killed and three were seriously
wounded. The post was on the outskirts of Ticrapo, a village 85
miles west of Ayacucho.
   Fifteen other soldiers stationed at Ticrapo were patrolling the
countryside in search of Shining Path guerrillas when the attack
occurred, police said.
   Guerrillas in the past two years have stepped up direct attacks
on the military, which controls most of adjoining Ayacucho and
Huancavelica states, but Monday's military death toll was the
highest in a single action.
   The heaviest previous military losses also occurred in
Huancavelica state in February and a year earlier.
   Ten soldiers were slain in both instances when guerrillas
exploded road mines as troop trucks passed.

<HEAD>Gun Control Advocates Hope For National Boost From Maryland
Referendum</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS last graf with 2 grafs to add background on
law-enforcement officials' endorsement of proposal.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A referendum on Maryland's pioneering handgun
law has provoked a bitter fight between pro-gun forces and the
state's political establishment that could turn the tide on the
issue nationwide.
   Voters will decide Nov. 8 whether to keep the tough law passed
this spring designed to ban cheap handguns known as Saturday Night
Specials.
   Still smarting from congressional rejection last month of a bill
requiring a seven-day waiting period before anyone can obtain a
handgun, gun control advocates hope a yes vote in Maryland will
rally their movement and provide encouragement for gun control
battles in the New Jersey and Florida legislatures.
   The campaign has embroiled the National Rifle Association, state
gun clubs, the Roman Catholic church, the black community, most
major law enforcement officials and Gov. William Donald Schaefer in
a struggle characterized by charges of racism and misrepresentation.
   ``There is a sort of tidal effect that comes and goes on issues
like this,'' said Michael Beard, director of the National Coalition
to Ban Handguns. ``If they (the NRA) lose a couple of battles then
they lose a lot of their power.''
   The NRA has devoted $3 million to the repeal effort, outspending
the law's supporters by 10-1.
   ``Either way it goes it's going to have some impacts in other
states. If it's lost it doesn't mean other states are automatically
going to follow suit. We've been successful in blocking other
attempts, but it would be an impetus,'' said Richard Gardiner, the
NRA's assistant general counsel.
   Barbara Lautman, spokeswoman for Handgun Control Inc., charged
the referendum has become a ``test of how much money it will take
the NRA to distort the truth. If we lose in Maryland, it will mean
that once again the NRA's millions won out over common sense.''
   The law's supporters are counting on the vigorous support of
Schaefer and other well-known Marylanders. Schaefer has taped
television spots that denounce the NRA for interference.
   Four other states have laws banning cheap handguns _ Illinois,
Minnesota, South Carolina and Hawaii _ but Maryland's is unique
because it doesn't define what constitutes a Saturday Night
Special, leaving that task to a nine-member board appointed by the
governor.
   The Handgun Roster Board is required to compile a list of
handguns with legitimate recreation and personal security uses that
may be sold in the state after Jan. 1, 1990. The law also bans the
new breed of mostly plastic guns that can't be detected by security
devices in airports and courthouses.
   The board has become the major substantive issue in the debate,
with opponents contending it would have authority to outlaw all
handguns, a charge supporters say is false.
   Charges of racism have been leveled against the pro-gun forces,
who are appealing to black voters with the argument that banning
cheap handguns would deprive the poor of their right to protect
themselves against crime.
   The Most Rev. John H. Ricard, a leading black Roman Catholic
clergyman in Baltimore, described the tactic as ``a poorly veiled
attempt to pit blacks against the majority. That's offensive to all
citizens. This ugly racist campaign thrust should be ended at
once.''
   The Catholic church has been criticized for its high-profile
support for the law. One pro-gun leader urged parishioners to drop
spent bullet cartridges in collection baskets to protest the
church's stance. There were no reports of anyone doing so.
   Among the law-enforcement leaders endorsing the gun ban are
Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Secretary of Public Safety
Bishop L. Robinson, the state branch of the Fraternal Order of
Police, and associations of state troopers, sheriffs and chiefs of
police.
   George Young, the California political consultant directing the
repeal campaign, summed up the opposition argument: ``Americans
have an inalienable right to self defense ... the right of people
to purchase the handgun of their choice. History tells us you lose
your rights in increments. This is an increment we intend to
oppose.''

   University of North Dakota officials say
they'll accept a $5 million endowment from a Las Vegas hotel owner
who threw Adolf Hitler birthday parties for his employees,
concluding he meant them only as a joke.
   A delegation from the school flew to Nevada on Sunday and met
with Ralph Engelstad, 58, a onetime University of North Dakota
hockey player who owns the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. The
trip was prompted by disclosures about Engelstad's private
collection of Nazi memorabilia, housed at the hotel, and the Hitler
parties.
   ``I don't think the World War II collection that we saw is a
problem in itself,'' said Barry Vickrey, associate dean of the
university law school. ``The bigger problem is some of Ralph
Engelstad's actions, most notably the Hitler parties, which have
given the whole collection a sinister context.
   ``Our delegation seemed to conclude that his motives were
unthinking, and that's not good,'' Vickrey said. ``But we weren't
able to conclude that he was anti-Semitic or pro-Hitler.''
   The collection includes a portrait of Hitler ``which has that
unfortunate, `To Ralphie, from Adolf,' on there,'' said Dave
Vorland, executive assistant to the university's president.
Engelstad explained the fake inscription as a joke, according to
the Star Tribune of Minneapolis.
   Engelstad also admits hanging an artist's portrait of himself as
a Nazi at a Hitler party _ ``again as a joke.''
   Officials said the university in Grand Forks, N.D., doesn't plan
to turn down Engelstad's money and won't change the name of the
Ralph Engelstad Arena, formerly the Winter Sports Center. But the
university's president, Thomas Clifford, added that the university
is watching the controversy for any new developments and ``we're
keeping our options open.''
   Engelstad pledged the $5 million endowment to benefit the
school's hockey program and has already given $500,000.
   Details about the Hitler parties and other elements surfaced
during an investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Commission.
   In a statement delivered at a news conference last week, the
hotel owner said he threw Hitler birthday parties this year and in
1986 to boost employee morale at the casino.
   ``Looking for an excuse, I suggested one with Adolf's birthday
as a theme,'' he said. ``It wasn't meant to honor Hitler.''
   ``I can't tell you how much I regret my insensitivity on this
point. It was innocent, but it was very, very bad judgment. ... I
deeply regret it and apologize for it. ... I despise Hitler and
everything he stood for.''
   At one of the Hitler parties, Engelstad handed out T-shirts
depicting Nazi battle scenes as favors, said Clifford.
   ``He said it wasn't the brightest idea he ever had,'' Clifford
said. ``But I don't think it had anything to do with neo-Nazism. It
was just a bad joke ... bad taste.''
   In a letter to the Jewish Federation of Las Vegas, Engelstad
said he now plans to sell his collection of cars and other World
War II Axis memorabilia.

<TEXT>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia says he
wishes Iran had sent a delegation to a meeting of Islamic
information ministers, the latest Saudi overture aimed at easing
bitter differences among Moslem nations.
   Fahd's signal to Iran came at the opening of the conference
attended by information ministers from about 45 Islamic nations.
   ``I would have wished the Iranian delegation to be with us,''
Fahd said in a speech Tuesday. ``Iran is an Islamic country, and
deep in my heart I would have loved to see my Iranian brothers here
today.''
   Iran's culture is Persian and most of its people belong to the
minority Shiite branch of Islam. Most Arabs belong to the Sunni
branch.
   A leading Islamic spokesman, meanwhile, assailed Western news
media for their reporting on Islamic matters.
   ``The image of the Muslim people in the world has been
stereotyped as backward, ignorant, fundamentalist and lacking
culture and civilization,'' said Sharifuddin Pirzada of Pakistan,
secretary-general of the Islamic Conference Organization.
   Saudi Arabia is hosting the information minister's conference in
this port city on the Red Sea. Officials said the gathering was
aimed at improving the flow of information among Islamic countries
and enhancing the image of Islam in the non-Muslim world.
   Fahd told delegates Islamic countries had to show the world
their faith was based on ``peace and stability.''
   His gesture to Iran was the clearest in a series of recent Saudi
overtures. It comes as Tehran seeks to improve relations with both
Arab and Western nations after the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the
8-year-old war with Iraq.
   The Saudis broke off diplomatic relations with Tehran April 26
after accusing the Tehran regime of carrying out sabotage,
subversion and terrorism against Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other
Arab states.
   The king's remarks came a week after the Saudi government
executed four saboteurs it said were working on Iran's behalf.
   Iran condemned the executions and accused Saudi Arabia and other
gulf Arab states of producing more oil than the quotas set by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to drive down oil
prices to weaken Tehran.
   Pirzada's attack on Western news media, delivered in a closed
session, was not reported in detail by the official Saudi press
agency, but a partial transcript was obtained by The Associated
Press.
   He said the international media are ``mostly unaware of and
indifferent to the realities of the Islamic world.
   ``At times they are actively hostile and indifferent toward our
faith, our cultural heritage, our objectives of socio-economic
development and our efforts to safeguard our independence,'' he
said.
   Pirzada said news reports from Western agencies, none of which
he named, ``either ignore or deliberately distort and undermine the
just causes of the Muslims.
   ``Our faith is villified, our culture sneered at, our
difficulties magnified and our peoples, governments and
institutions subjected to misrepresentation, ridicule and
censure,'' he said.

   A prosecution witness in the divorce-fixing
trial of Bess Myerson admitted under cross-examination that a
lawyer for the other side in the divorce case also did a favor for
the judge's daughter.
   Miss Myerson, a former Miss America and city cultural affairs
commissioner, is accused of giving a city job to the daughter of
former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, in exchange for
favorable rulings in the divorce of Miss Myerson's lover, Carl
``Andy'' Capasso.
   Testimony by Mrs. Gabel's law secretary resumed today at federal
court in Manhattan, with the judge's daughter expected to take the
stand later in the day.
   Under questioning today by Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart
Abrams, the law secretary, Howard Leventhal, amended his previous
testimony about when Mrs. Capasso's lawyer got an apartment for the
judge's daughter.
   On Tuesday, Leventhal said he didn't remember exactly when the
apartment had been obtained, but questioning by defense lawyers
left the impression that Mrs. Capasso's lawyer had done an innocent
favor for Mrs. Gabel's daughter while the judge was considering
issues in the divorce case.
   ``To the best of my knowledge,'' Leventhal said today, the
lawyer's help came after ``Justice Gabel's completing her rulings
in the Capassos' case.''
   The lawyer, Raoul Felder, said Tuesday that he helped Miss Gabel
find an apartment in 1986, by which time the Capasso case was
``ancient history.'' Felder is not accused of any wrongdoing.
   On Tuesday, Leventhal also testified that Miss Myerson called
the judge's private line several times while Mrs. Gabel was
deciding whether to cut Capasso's weekly support payments to his
estranged wife.
   According to the prosecution witness, Mrs. Gabel apparently did
not tell lawyers in the divorce trial about the Myerson phone calls
when the judge offered to excuse herself from the case after a
newspaper article revealed that Miss Myerson had hired the judge's
daughter.
   But under cross-examination by Mrs. Gabel's lawyer, Leventhal
said that Mrs. Gabel readily told him Miss Myerson was the
mysterious person calling and identifying herself as ``Barbara
Robinson'' or ``Barbara Goodman.''
   ``Did she (the judge) react in panic when you asked that
question?'' asked Feldberg.
   ``No, not at all,'' said Leventhal. ``She reacted in a jocular
manner.''
   Miss Myerson is accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job to
Sukhreet Gabel, who was then 34, shortly after Miss Myerson became
cultural affairs commissioner in 1983. The prosecution alleges the
former beauty queen wanted to get the judge to reduce Capasso's
temporary support payments.
   Mrs. Gabel also did not tell the divorce lawyers that Felder
helped Sukhreet Gabel obtain an apartment, Leventhal testified
under questioning by the judge's defense attorney, Michael Feldberg.
   On Sept. 14, 1983, Mrs. Gabel cut Capasso's weekly temporary
alimony and child support payments from $1,850 to $680 a week.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, claiming he was
politically stronger than during his first debate with Democratic
rival Michael Dukakis, said today he would show Americans ``what my
heartbeat is'' when he tangles with Dukakis again Thursday night.
   The vice president said he was ready for the final nationally
broadcast campaign debate, which starts at 9 p.m. EDT Thursday on
the UCLA campus.
   ``We do tend to be a little stronger politically these days. But
what I want to do is have them (viewers) understand what my
heartbeat is, what I really care about,'' he told reporters at a
breakfast meeting with Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates, a
Republican supporter.
   Asked about his goals for the next debate, Bush replied, ``It's
less statistics ... than it is how I would like to lead this
country, where I'd like to see us by the 90s. So I want to spell it
out in a broader sense this time. Let the others nitpick on all
these little numbers.''
   He said he would keep portraying Dukakis as a liberal. ``He
cannot run away from his past,'' the vice president said.
   Bush spent most of the day working with debate coach Richard G.
Darman, the former deputy treasury secretary who played the role of
Dukakis for the first presidential debate Sept. 25, and studying
briefing papers alone.
   Other debate coaches, including media adviser Roger Ailes, were
arriving later today.
   The relatively quiet day in Los Angeles comes on the heels of a
Seattle appearance Tuesday that was disrupted by a shouting Jesuit
priest.
   The Rev. Bill Bichsel, who works with the homeless in Tacoma,
Wash., was forcibly removed from the hall by police after he stood
up in the audience and yelled out his objections to Reagan
administration policies.
   His words could not be heard clearly over the loud public
address system Bush was using and the vice president continued
speaking. At one point, Bush stopped and took note of the protester.
   ``Isn't this a great country. You can run into all kinds of
characters in my line of work. This one's ... amazing,'' he said.
   Bichsel said he was given a citation for criminal trespassing
and was released. A police spokesman in Seattle was unavailable for
comment.
   Bush continued to pound out the anti-crime theme that his
advisers have targeted as a vote-getter in the waning weeks of the
campaign. But the focus Tuesday was on white-collar crime.
   Bush told the audience of Seattle University business students
he would ``throw the book at white-collar criminals as hard as we
throw it at other criminals.''
   ``The fact is that most of the people on Wall Street are honest,
hard working people. And beyond that, much of the money made tere
is recycled to foundations to help the poor, universities and other
worthy causes,'' he said.
   ``But abuse will rear its ugly head without vigorous law
enforcement,'' he said.
   Bush also accused Dukakis of ``protectionist demagoguery''
because of Dukakis' recent statements against foreign ownership of
U.S. industry.
   ``For political reasons, he sees advantage in stoking fears
about foreign influence,'' Bush charged.
   ``My opponent needs an issue, and he's willing to scare people
to find it,'' he said, accusing his opponent of flip-flopping on
the protection issues and being a ``believe-nothing candidate.''

   A contractor has been charged with stealing a

bricks.
   Police said Edward R. Pratt hired a demolition company to tear
down and haul away a house for its estimated 30,000 to 40,000
bricks. Used bricks are worth $125 to $200 per thousand, making the
haul worth $3,750 to $8,000, brick dealers say.
   Darlene Brazier, a police officer, and her husband, William, who
own the house, said they are left with a partially demolished house
and must now pay for the remainder of the demolition.
   The house, which was empty, was worth about $16,000, Mrs.
Brazier said.
   ``From the start, this house has been a nightmare,'' she said.
``Now it is up to us to make it safe. The house is very dangerous
and there are a lot of children in the area.''
   Pratt was charged Tuesday with theft by deception and attempting
to obtain a city demolition permit by deception. Police said Pratt
is an independent contractor who buys and sells used bricks.

   A racetrack owner says he will
discontinue ``sack races'' in which drivers compete with bags over
their heads after a guide in one of the cars suffered serious
injuries in a crash.
   Harold Chafin said the event at Highland Rim Speedway was
intended to amuse spectators. But Jamie Hull, 32, suffered broken
ribs, a broken breast bone, collapsed lung and a deep gash on his
forehead.
   Hull was riding with Tommy Hagewood, his brother-in-law and a
regular driver at the speedway who received some bruises and a cut
on his knee in the four-lap, three-car event.
   Kay Hull said she did not know why her husband decided to join
in Saturday's race.
   ``We had come to the track to watch my brother Tommy and he
decided he was going to enter the (sack) race,'' she said. ``It all
happened so fast. The next thing I knew his car had hit the wall.''
   Chafin said the race is normally run at about 10 mph and that
Hagewood was going faster than that.
   Hull was listed in good condition in the intensive care unit of
Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

<HEAD>Will Yearly Tax Returns Become a Soviet Ritual?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another Western influence may soon follow rock
music and fast food into Soviet society: the ritual of filing
annual financial returns and paying a progressive income tax.
   A pair of economists said in articles published Wednesday that a
complete reform of the Soviet tax system is necessary to expose
those who have made fortunes in the multibillion dollar black
market, and spread income more equitably.
   ``To search for some kind of scientific approach in our system
of taxation is useless,'' Deputy Finance Minister Viktor Semenov
told the weekly Moscow News.
   Semenov and economist V. Yaroshenko, writing in the Communist
Party daily newspaper Pravda, both said a yearly statement of
income and expenditures was essential.
   Yaroshenko added that the income tax should be made more
progressive, as it is in many other countries, to be fairer to poor
people.
   Currently, Soviets pay a flat 10 percent of their income in tax
if they make less than $320 a month, the average industrial wage.
The rate increases a few percentage points for higher incomes. Most
taxes are deducted at the work place and workers don't need to file
annual tax returns.
   ``Declarations of income and expenditures would serve as a means
of strong economic and psychological action most of all against the
system of organized crime,'' said Yaroshenko.
   By filling out such forms, illegal millionaires would be making
a ``preliminary accusation'' of themselves, he said.
   Black marketeering and other organized crime saps the economy of
more money every year than is paid out in benefits to pensioners,
invalids, students, families with many children and orphans, he
said.
   It is so well-organized that it constitutes a ``government
within the government,'' he said.
   The current economic and tax structure hurts the poor,
Yaroshenko said. He suggested the government impose more
progressive income taxes, and that illegal millionaires be allowed
to give their ill-gotten wealth to state-run charities anonymously
before filing their financial statements.
   Yaroshenko's article was the second published in Pravda in two
days to address the effects of economic reforms on the Soviet poor.
In an article published Tuesday, a farm economist said increasing
food prices would be an unacceptable way to eliminate the $105
billion the government pays every year in subsidies. Instead, Kim.
N. Khmelkov said the Soviet Union must make farming much more
efficient.
   In yet another article printed Wednesday, Moscow News said that
in the first half of the year, $130,000 was confiscated in the
Soviet capital from people illegally trading rubles for hard
currencies. But it said police are nowhere near able to control the
problem.
   Western tourists are approached near hotels and tourist sites in
large cities by hordes of people offering to exchange money. Such
exchanges are illegal and give the Soviets access to goods they
cannot buy in the official economy.
   Yaroshenko blamed the pervasiveness of organized crime on the
centralized Soviet economy's inability to produce large quantities
of high-quality consumer goods.
   ``Instead of the usual `sold' and `bought,' we started to say,
`threw out,' and `managed to get,''' Yaroshenko said. ``That money
is hard to earn has always been normal and natural _ but that it is
hard to spend, this is an alarming symptom.''
   Semenov said the tax system will be reformed in the early 1990s,
when economists also are aiming to implement a comprehensive system
of price reform.
   The government must reduce indirect taxes that are worked into
the retail prices of many goods and turn to direct taxes that now
make up only 7.5 percent of the national budget, he said.
   Semenov said some of the heaviest indirect taxes historically
have been imposed on light industry and food processing, two areas
of the economy Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is urgently
trying to reform to provide a better life for Soviet citizens.
   Taxes significantly raise the retail price of refrigerators,
vacuum cleaners, TV sets and tape recorders, he said.
   The wholesale price of a Volga, the largest standard passenger
car produced in the country, is $5,460. After indirect taxes are
added, however, the final retail price is more than $25,600.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan borrowed a phrase from
Dan Quayle to hustle votes for the Republican ticket, urging high
school students to participate in the November election to help
keep America ``the envy of the world.''
   Reagan was campaigning today in Pennsylvania and New Jersey as
chief surrogate for GOP nominee George Bush while the vice
president prepares for his second and final debate Thursday night
with Democratic rival Michael Dukakis in Los Angeles.
   In a speech before students at Upper Darby High School in
suburban Philadelphia, a Republican stronghold he last visited late
in his 1980 campaign, the president made repeated references to
Quayle, Bush's running mate, and echoed the Indiana senator's
assertion that America is the wonder of the world.
   But Reagan said that unless the nation's youngsters take part in
the election, all that he has fought for in the past eight years
might be lost.
   ``I am dedicating myself this year to making sure that this
future of hope built on opportunity and traditional values remains
open to each of you,'' he said, citing the strong economegrees, although
Romanians
and foreign visitors say many houses actually are colder than that.
   The energy decree did not mention any change in the quotas for
natural gas, indicating strict limits set last year remained in
force.
   The higher quotas for electricty, while not considerably
improving Romanians' living standards _ generally viewed as among
the lowest in Europe _ were perceived as a sign that the regime of
President and Communist Party leader Nicolae Ceausescu may fear new
public protests at the outset of winter.
   About 10,000 people marched through the streets of Brasov,
Romania's second-largest city in November, shouting slogans against
the regime and clamoring for ``more food and more heating.''
   The protest in Brasov, a leading industrial center, was believed
to be the largest against the government since the communist
takeover in 1947.
   The comparatively higher power quotas this year might have also
been intended to shield Romania from the wave of unrest in
neighboring Yugoslavia triggered by worsening living conditions and
ethnic problems in the Balkan nation.
   Romanians also have suffered from widespread food shortages, and
despite official calls for better supplies of meat, cheese and
other staples, shortages have worsened, Romanians and Western
diplomats in Bucharest said.
   In July, even bread was hard to find in the capital for a week.
   White flour, cooking oil, sugar, butter and eggs have been
rationed since the early 1980s, but in August and September no
sugar rations were distributed.
   Romania's centralized economy has been grappling with perennial
failures in the past decade to meet plan targets in coal-mining and
shortcomings in the operation of coal-fired stations. Scinteia
recently has again carried articles complaining about repair delays
and poor supply of coal at the stations.
   Under the measures published Wednesday, electricity consumption
beyond assigned quotas will be penalized with up to four times the
normal charge.
   According to the measures, a family of three to four people
living in a three-room apartment will be alloted a quota of 47
kilowatt hours in January for lighting and other household needs,
which equaled the quota for that month two years ago.
   An energy-saving decree issued in November, regarded by
Romanians as beyond the absolute minium they could be expected to
endure, had alloted a family just 35 kilowatt hours for that month.
   Last year, a family of three was allotted 236 cubic meters of
natural gas for heating and cooking in January, the coldest month
of the winter.
   In most homes, cooking is done by natural gas. Heating systems
in the apartment blocks, where most urban Romanians live, are
heated by centrally controlled thermal systems that authorities can
turn down to decreed limits.

   Police have impounded a
government vehicle loaded with 132 elephant tusks and detained four
people, it was reported Wednesday.
   The vehicle, belonging to the Morogoro Regional Development
Directorate, was found Sunday in Morogoro region west of this
Indian Ocean port city and north of the Selous game reserve, the
state-run Tanzania News Agency said.
   The government did not cite the ivory's estimated worth.
   The world market value for ivory is $82 per pound, according to
Nairobi-based trade expert Esmond Bradley Martin. An average tusk
weighs about 12 pounds, which would put the current market value of
132 tusks at about $130,000.
   Although big game hunting is permitted at controlled levels in
Tanzania, the country has outlawed elephant hunting. In the last 11
years, poachers have slashed Tanzania's elephant herd in half, to
about 55,000.

   K mart is recalling two types of squeeze toys
and some telephone-shaped rattles which could pose choking hazards
for children, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission
reported Wednesday.
   Involved in the recall are an estimated 81,000 ``Baby's First
Squeeze Toys'' and some 75,000 ``Baby's First Playball'' squeeze
toys, plus about 33,000 plastic ``Telephone Receiver Rattles,'' the
commission said.
   All three products went on sale in late 1987, the agency said.
The squeeze toys cost about $1 and the rattles $2.
   Parents were urged to remove all three toys from use and to
return them to K mart for a refund.
   Baby's First Squeeze Toy came in three shapes: telephone
receiver, barbell and dumbbell, while the playball came in the form
of a baseball, basketball or soccer ball.

   China has authorized South Korea's
flag carrier Korean Air to fly over the communist country through
October, extending an earlier permit for the Olympics, the
Transportation Ministry said Wednesday.
   Under the renewed permit, officials said KAL will operate 17
flights on the Seoul-Zurich route and five on the Seoul-Tripoli
route over Chinese territory.
   They said KAL will be able to save $1,300 in fuel per flight.
Its usual southern route is through Taipei and Bangkok en route to
European and Middle East points.
   Under the earlier permit, KAL flew over China from Sept. 3 to
Oct. 9 for transporting Olympic athletes and officials.
   The Korea Herald, an English-language daily, quoted a ministry
official as saying KAL may continue to fly over China after the end
of this month. A ministry spokesman said he had no knowledge of the
report.
   KAL also was seeking an extension of a similar permit from the
Soviet Union that also allowed flights over the Soviet Union on the
Seoul-Europe route during the Olympics.
   South Korea has no diplomatic relations with the two communist
countries.

accompanied the latest joint team searching crash sites for
evidence of Americans still missing in action from the Vietnam War.
This is his report.

   At low tide, the beach seems to extend
all the way to the submerged wreckage of an American bomber shot
down 20 years ago near the lighthouse that unwittingly guided its
raid on this industrial port.
   Residents of nearby villages recall little about the crash and
the fate of the crew remains a mystery to them. The local
administrator said he wrote a brief report for his superiors but
does not know what happened to it.
   The United States still seeks to account for 2,393 Americans
listed as missing in action in the Southeast Asia war more than 13
years after it ended. Defense Department sources in Washington say
about 400 were airmen lost in crashes in water, whose remains
probably never will be recovered.
   Difficulties even with cases considered most easily resolvable
show a hard road lies ahead despite last week's unprecedented joint
investigations in Vietnam, where 1,757 Americans are missing.
   U.S. and Vietnamese specialists searched in five provinces,
visiting crash sites and interviewing villagers about six lost
airmen. The six are among 70 ``discrepancy cases'' Washington says
Vietnam should have information on, including cases of men captured
but never returned.
   They retrieved two sets of unidentified remains and some
wreckage but it was an arduous task just reaching the sites, which
were chosen in part becasue of their nearness to Hanoi, the
capital. The team trekked across mountainous, leech-infested areas,
through monsoon rains and along roads enveloped in blinding dust.
   Wreckage from a 1968 crash is said to be submerged in a
water-filled crater in a rice field at Die Hop village near
Haiphong.
   Tran Van Loi, 50, then the local Communist Party chief, said the
villagers put the airman's body in a nylon bag and buried it near
the wreckage, but he could not find it now because the land has
been planted so often.
   Wreckage litters rice fields from Haiphong to Hanoi, but only
the cores of jet engines remained at two sites visited last week.
   Nguyen Hop, 60, said residents stripped all the metal for
souvenirs and to make household items after a crash near his
village in 1967. He smiled and held up a large rice pot made from
the wreckage.
   At another crash site nearby, young men still were stripping a
muddied jet turbine 20 years after the crash, selling the metal for
the equivalent of half a cent a pound.
   U.S. experts also surveyed crash sites in Laos recently for a
planned fourth joint excavation, but reported no progress in
obtaining numerous remains the authorities in war-torn Cambodia
claim to have.
   The project in Vietnam was a major breakthrough because many
U.S. officials believe Vietnam is withholding information, a
suspicion fed by previous refusals of permission for U.S. experts
to search the countryside.
   Washington demands ``the fullest possible accounting'' of the
missing, which requires trust built on progress with the
discrepancy cases, said a Western official interviewed in Bangkok,
Thailand, who has an important role in the matter.
   ``What I want most is to get some kind of confidence that we are
getting something approaching full disclosure on the discrepancy
cases,'' he said, on condition of anonymity.
   Diplomats in Hanoi see the cooperation as a a step toward
diplomatic relations, now blocked by U.S. opposition to Vietnam's
military occupation of Cambodia. They say Foreign Minister Nguyen
Co Thach convinced Communist Party colleagues to allow the
investigations, putting aside preoccupations with sovereignty and
security to do what is needed to improve ties with Washington.
   ``Everyone agrees it's extremely unlikely they will account for
all the MIAs,'' one Western ambassador said. ``The joint
investigation is an exercise in trying to find ways and means of
normalizing relations. It's symbolism.''
   U.S. bombers raided North Vietnam from 1965 to 1968, then again
in 1972. Pilots followed the glow of the lighthouse to strike
Haiphong, the country's biggest port, Vietnamese officials said.
   The U.S. Defense Department says the official press published
information on U.S. aircraft losses in North Vietnam throughout the
war and Hanoi kept records on deaths and burials of prisoners.
   Of the 2,393 MIA cases, 1,128 were classified from the beginning
as ``killed in action-body not recovered,'' and Defense Department
sources say few of the remains will be found.
   The other 1,265 originally were labeled ``prisoner of
war-missing in action,'' but a few years ago all but one symbolic
case were changed to the status of presumed dead.
   In the villages, what evidence remains is fading with the
memories of older residents and the destruction wrought by man and
nature.
   Investigators said it was difficult to find people still living
in crash areas because they fled during the bombing. Reports on
crashes written by local officials often were inaccurate because of
the chaos, said Nguyen Can, head of Vietnam's MIA office.
   He said Vietnam has resolved 22 of the 70 discrepany cases, 11
by returning remains and the others by concluding after
interviewing villagers that nothing could be recovered. In some
cases aircraft exploded in the air, he said.
   A U.S. investigator said: ``You go to a town in the U.S. and you
ask what happened 20-25 years ago, after offices have been moved,
records have been moved. It's hard. (The Vietnamese) have no
equipment, no personnel, no money and they have great economic
problems of their own.''

   More than 2,000 mourners who filled a
school gym to remember five young girls killed by a speeding car
heard condolences from President Reagan and a tape of a victim
singing ``Could've Been.''
   Many at Tuesday night's community service at Pulaski High School
hugged and sobbed as the tape recording of rock star Tiffany's
song, sung by 12-year-old Nicole Watia, was played.
   ``The flowers you gave me are just about to die. When I think of
what could have been, it makes me want to cry,'' sang the girl's
high-pitched voice.
   This morning, 1,000 mourners filled filled a church for a
funeral of three of the five girls who were killed Friday night.
   The Rev. Jordan Kuczwara told the mourners, many of them young,
that they could cry today and go back to their lives tomorrow or
they could thank God for the gift of the girls' short lives and
learn from them.
   ``Thirteen years young, but old enough to achieve something,''
said the pastor of Assumption of Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic
Church.
   He said the girls needed no drugs or alcohol, but found
happiness in their friends, family and faith. ``Remember, students,
don't cry for them. ... Cry for those who are looking for other
ways to find happiness,'' Kuczwara said.
   Sobs rose as the caskets of Nicole, one month shy of her 13th
birthday, and Laura Karcz and Brenda Hylok, both 13, were closed in
the church. Separate services were scheduled later today for Jodi
Prokop and Jessica McKeefry, both 13.
   At Tuesday's gathering, Nicole's version of the song was among
the personal mementos the victims' families shared as this village
of about 1,900 gathered for the first time since the accident.
   ``I feel they (the mourners) want something to happen but they
don't know what they want to happen,'' said the Rev. Jordan
Kuczwara, pastor of Assumption of Blessed Virgin Mary Church.
   Police have been puzzled as to why the driver of the 1975
Cadillac, a 17-year-old high school junior, was going an estimated
70 mph down the residential street before it jumped a curb, killing
the Glenbrook Elementary seventh-graders in front of Jessica's
house.
   Investigators planned to check the vehicle for possible
mechanical problems and to investigate whether the driver, a
diabetic, suffered a medical problem such as a seizure, said Police
Chief Reed Woodward.
   No alcohol was involved, he said.
   Reagan, in a message sent with Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., to the
village about 15 miles northwest of Green Bay, said, ``Nancy and I
join with each and every one of you as you mourn the loss of five
precious young lives.
   ``There are no words to express what you are feeling or the
grief that your fellow Americans share with you as a result of this
great tragedy.''
   Crying girls hugged one another at the high school, where dozens
of floral arrangements surrounded the five closed caskets lined at
one end of the gym.
   James Brawner, Glenbrook Elementary's principal, estimated that
more than 2,000 people filed past the caskets to hug the girls'
families and offer sympathy.
   Collages of photographs depicting each victim's life were placed
on easels near each casket.
   Among the letters, cards and messages read during the service
was a poem on friendship that Laura Karcz's sister, Lisa, said was
one of the last her sister had written.
   ``I need someone to stick to me to the end and I know that you
will because you are my friend,'' the poem said.
   The Rev. Floyd Grothman, minister at St. John's Lutheran Church
in Pulaski, where Jessica's funeral was planned for today,
applauded the community for the way it came together in the wake of
the tragedy.
   ``I love Pulaski more. It's a community,'' he said. ``I don't
think I saw such a concentration of hugging that I saw Friday
night. Pulaski cares. Pulaski hugs.''
   Residents also expressed concern for the driver of the car,
Scott Karcz, who was listed in critical condition Monday at a Green
Bay hospital. Hospital officials said Tuesday his parents had asked
that no further reports be given on his condition. Karcz is a
distant relative of Laura Karcz.
   His 11-year-old sister, Tina, who was a passenger in the car,
was also seriously injured.
   ``I'm sensing among the kids that they're feeling bad for the
Karcz family,'' said Guy David, principal of the high school that
Scott Karcz attends.

   A commission of journalists and academics, the
third panel in 14 years to tackle the topic, called Wednesday for
reviving the presidential press conference and making it a
``frequent, routine and undramatic'' institution.
   ``The longer presidents go without a press conference, the
greater the suspicion that there is something to hide, and the
greater the pressure becomes for holding press conferences,'' the
panel said.
   ``When, ultimately, the president holds a conference, it is
liable to be a hostile affair in which both the president and the
press look bad. It would seem better, on balance, for the president
to take his lumps on a more frequent basis.''
   At the same time, the Harvard Commission on the Presidential
News Conference said, the media must mend their ways if the press
conference is to revive. The public won't lend its attention to the
sessions if it believes reporters' questions are unfair, irrelevant
or overly aggressive, it concluded.
   The 16-member commission studied the issue for a year. It was
appointed by the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy
School of Government. It was co-chaired by former newscaster Marvin
Kalb, director of the center; and Frederick W. Mayer, assistant
professor of public policy at Duke University.
   The commission said the presidential press conference, a
75-year-old institution, ``is not aging well'' and that under
Ronald Reagan it has fallen into ``a serious state of disrepair.''
   Reagan has held only 45 formal news conferences in his nearly
eight years in office and once let 5{ months pass, during the
Iran-Contra affair, without a formal meeting with reporters.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with reporters nearly 1,000
times in 13 years in office.
   ``We believe that all parties would benefit from restoring the
habit of frequent, routine and undramatic news conferences,'' the
panel's report said.
   Properly conducted, news conferences can serve presidents, press
and public alike, the commission said, and all suffer when the
institution deteriorates.
   ``The press can often be irritating to presidents, appearing to
assume an adversarial posture, question tactics and motives,
distort the president's message or divulge uncomfortable
information,'' the report added.
   ``When presidents get bad press _ and all do at one point or
another during their presidency _ they are tempted to limit contact
with reporters or to limit contact to situations more controllable
than a press conference.''
   The panel recommended that presidents meet with the media twice
a month during daytime hours _ once with reporters who cover the
White House routinely and once with smaller groups of journalists _
and hold six televised evening news conferences a year.
   Daytime news conferences should be held ``to reduce the
temperature and encourage more substantive and useful exchanges,''
the panel suggested. It said this would give morning newspapers
more time to prepare their stories and allow television evening
news programs to show highlights of the session.
   The commission noted that it was the third to address the issue.
In 1974, in the wake of Watergate, a group of scholars met at the
Boston University School of Communication and concluded the press
conference was in a sad state.
   Six years later, after President Carter had avoided the press
during the Iran hostage crisis, a panel at the University of
Virginia decried the ``distressing disrepair'' of the institution.
   Last month, presidential candidates George Bush and Michael
Dukakis, answering questions raised by the Freedom of Information
Committee of The Associated Press Managing Editors Association,
promised to be accessible to the White House press if elected.
Neither would say how often he would hold formal news sessions,
however.

   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead on
Wednesday called on communist authorities to tear down the Berlin
Wall and praised East Germans who have risked their lives to escape
to the West.
   The State Department's No. 2 official, who spoke to reporters at
the wall in West Berlin, recalled President Reagan's June 1987
speech at the gray barrier East Germany built in 1961 to stop the
westward flow of refugees.
   ``(Reagan) called on those who put it up to tear it down _ and
so they should. The sooner the better,'' said Whitehead, who is in
Europe on an official visit to East and West Germany, Romania,
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   ``(The Berlin Wall) is a gray, monstrous snake,'' he said as he
stood on a podium in front of what he called ``an anachronism, a
barrier inconsistent with our contemporary world.''
   He recalled recent escapes and escape attempts into West Berlin
from the eastern sector.
   ``When I hear of young men shot at as they run for freedom ...
or of a pregnant woman chased by a patrol boat as she swims ...
across the Spree (the river that divides East from West), I feel
deep admiration for the courage of those Berliners,'' Whitehead
said.
   Whitehead said that he had discussed with East German officials
their country's practice of shooting at people trying to escape.
   ``I do believe that the shootings are less frequent than when I
started to raise the issue,'' Whitehead told reporters.
   Whitehead said the Allies governing West Berlin _ the United
States, Britain and France _ would continue to support Reagan's
1987 ``Berlin Initiative'' aimed at easing regulations and
improving international air access to the divided city.
   The Allied powers in December issued a memorandum to Soviet
officials proposing improvements to the Berlin Initiative.
   Allied officials have refused to disclose the Soviet response,
but the West German newspaper Bild am Sonntag said last month that
the Soviets accused the Allies of ``ignoring the territorial and
political realities of central Europe.''
   Whitehead's tour of Warsaw Pact countries included talks in East
Berlin on Tuesday with East German leader Erich Honecker.
   Whitehead also said ``a time of change'' was coming to Eastern
Europe because of people's dissatisfaction with economic and social
conditions.

   A strong earthquake off the northern coast
of Taiwan shook houses in Taipei on Wednesday, although there were
no reports of casualties or damage, the Central Weather Bureau said.
   The temblor, recorded at 6:45 p.m. with its epicenter at sea
about 60 miles northeast of Taipei, registered 5.7 on the Richter
scale of ground motion, the bureau said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   although subsequent presidents have been tempted to put the press
back out on the street, none has been willing to pay the price to
do it,'' the Harvard Commission on the Presidential News Conference
said Wednesday in a report urging more frequent meetings with the
media.
   The commission gave this history of the presidential news
conference:
   THEODORE ROOSEVELT: Although he took reporters in out of the
rain, his sessions were not really news conferences: ``the
reporters simply stood and listened while the president talked to
them, often while being shaved by the White House barber.''
   WOODROW WILSON: Really the father of the news conference. He
believed presidents should be obliged to answer reporters'
questions, just as British prime ministers field questions from the
opposition in the House of Commons. Wilson met with the press once
or twice a week in the first 2{ years of his term, then went a year
without a session and held irregular meetings thereafer.
   WARREN HARDING: Wilson's successor met with the press twice a
week for most of his presidency, but required that the questions be
written and submitted in advance.
   CALVIN COOLIDGE: His sessions were cooler. If he didn't like a
written question, he'd crumple it up and throw it away.
   HERBERT HOOVER: He met with reporters more than twice a week in
his first few months in office, but after the 1929 stock market
crash, he cut the frequency to once a week. These sessions were
short and uninformative.
   FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: He met with reporters almost twice a week
for 13 years. His press conferences were intimate affairs around
his desk or, at Warm Springs, Ga., around his car. He often
flattered reporters, impressed them with the depth of his
knowledge, sometimes bullied them, once sent a reporter to sit in
the corner wearing a dunce cap. He didn't insist on written
questions, but sometimes put answers off the record and usually
could only be paraphrased by reporters, not quoted directly.
   HARRY S. TRUMAN: He moved the press conference from the Oval
Office to the Indian Treaty Room in the Executive Office Building,
creating a more formal atmosphere. Most of what he said was on the
record, and sometimes his spunky, spontaneous answers got him in
trouble. He averaged fewer than one a week.
   DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER: He allowed television cameras in, changing
forever the nature of news conferences, although live telecasts
were not permitted. ``For the first time, the American people could
see their president as he interacted with the press,'' the report
noted. ``And for the first time, reporters themselves became
visible to the public as actors in the process.'' Eisenhower cut
the frequency, to once every two weeks.
   JOHN F. KENNEDY: His press conferences, marked by wit, ``became
the standard against which subsequent presidents would be judged _
or judge themselves.'' He had a briefing book prepared and
practiced answers.
   LYNDON JOHNSON: Kennedy was a tough act to follow, and Johnson,
to avoid questions when his Vietnam policy came under challenge,
took to making long opening statements. One study found his opening
statements consumed more than one-third of the time. He averaged
more than two press conferences a month.
   RICHARD NIXON: He averaged only six a year. During the Watergate
crisis, when he went for five months without a news conference, the
press became so hostile that he once stalked off without awaiting
the usual closing, ``Thank you, Mr. President.''
   GERALD FORD: He averaged one every three week, but still ``had
difficulty dampening the press cynicism that had developed during
the Johnson and Nixon administrations,'' the report said.
   JIMMY CARTER: He kept to a two-a-month pledge for a year and a
half, but ended up averaging half that many, holding fewer during
the Iran hostage crisis. He moved them to the evening out of
frustration with the way the television news shows edited his
remarks at daytime news conferences.
   RONALD REAGAN: He pledged to hold news conferences once a month,
but has held only 45 in more than 7{ years in office. Reporters
have become ``so frustrated with limited access and their feeling
of being manipulated that on occasion they have resorted to
shouting questions at the president whenever they are allowed
within earshot,'' the report said. ``The president, although
successful in the short run in dodging difficult questions, suffers
from the perception that he is not really in charge of his own
White House.''

   Leading Islamic spokesman urged
action Wednesday to counter what they said was widespread prejudice
against Moslems as backward, ignorant fanatics.
   The concern over anti-Moslem sentiment became a principal theme
as information ministers from more than 40 Islamic countries worked
on a plan to improve the exchange of news among themselves and
breaking down barriers to the non-Islamic world.
   Professor Abdelhadi Boutaleb, director-general of the Islamic
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said the world's
estimated 800 million Moslems must be educated against outside
influences including ``foreign media'' characterizations of
``backwardness, ignorance and fanaticism as the main features of
our peoples.''
   On Tuesday, Sharifuddin Pir Zadeh, the Pakistani
secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Conference, told a
closed session that reports from Western news agencies ``ignore or
deliberately distort'' Islamic issues.
   Some Saudi newspapers echoed the theme.
   The Jiddah-based English-language Arab News urged the
information ministers to act against an ``ugly phenomenon'' that it
said was particularly virulent in Western Europe, but also apparent
in nationalist movements within the communist bloc and increasing
even in the Third World.
   ``Outside the Islamic world, anti-Islamic prejudice is most
definitely on the increase. Much of it is pure religious bigotry,
but there is a marked streak of racism involved in it as well,''
the newspaper said.
   It said any effort to correct this would be wasted if it is
``nothing more than a machine pushing Islamic information back into
the Islamic world.
   ``We cannot allow ourselves to rely on the insensitive and
uncomprehending international news agencies ... when Islam is
involved,'' it said.
   Except for a U.S. television crew from Cairo, Western news
agencies appeared to be the only outside media permitted to cover
the conference. Saudi Arabia rarely grants entry to foreign
reporters.
   The two-day meeting in this Red Sea port city drew ministers or
their representatives from all but a few of the 46 members of the
conference.
   The absentees included Afghanistan, whose Marxist government was
expelled from the conference several years ago, and Iran, with
which host Saudi Arabia broke diplomatic relations in April.

   The capital's 17,000 cabbies on Wednesday
extended a 15-day boycott of downtown Athens to the end of the
month to protest anti-pollution measures restricting taxis in the
city center.
   Taxis are included in traffic restrictions banning half the
city's 800,000 cars from a 5-square-mile zone around the city
center from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays, based on odd and even
license plate numbers.
   ``We decided to extend the boycott until Oct. 31 because we felt
the government wasn't taking us seriously enough,'' said a
spokesman for the Athens Taxi Drivers Union.
   Cabbies object to the taxi ban, in effect since January, saying
half of their fares are generated in the city center. The union
says the average driver takes home about $400 a month.
   A brown colored smog, known to Athenians as the ``Nefos'' _ the
Greek word for cloud _ forms over the city on warm, still days.
Cars, diesel-powered taxis and the city's aging buses are blamed
for most of the pollution.
   The transport ministry has threatened taxi drivers boycotting
the downtown area with a $200 fine and removal of their operating
license.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today pledged $600
million to the United Nation's campaign for the reconstruction of
Afghanistan and repatriation of millions of Afghan refugees, the
program's coordinator said.
   The coordinator, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, told reporters the
Soviet pledge was the largest to date since an appeal for donations
went out in June. His Geneva-based office, the U.N. Humanitarian
and Economic Assistance Programs Relating to Afghanistan, estimates
that rebuilding that war-shattered nation will cost more than $2
billion.
   Moslem guerrillas have been at war for nearly 10 years with
Afghanistan's pro-Soviet government. Soviet troops entered the
country in December 1979 but began withdrawing in May under terms
of a U.N.-mediated accord signed in April.
   Under the agreement, the more than 100,000 Soviet troops are to
be out of Afghanistan by Aug. 15.
   Sadruddin said he has also received pledges of $60 million from
Japan, which said it planned further contributions and would send
civilian personnel to aid in refugee repatriation; $27 million from
West Germany; $7 million from Sweden; and 10,000 tons of food aid
from Greece worth $2 million.
   The United States was unable to estimate how much it would
contribute due to the upcoming presidental election and Congress
being in recess, Sadruddin said.
   He noted that the United States has already promised special
assistance to the Afghan people in detecting and clearing the mines
littering their homeland.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals today
overturned a decision that had threatened to throw the state's
``official English'' initiative off the Nov. 8 ballot on the
grounds that the petitions for the proposal should have been
available in Spanish.
   The appellate court panel issued the decision at the end of a
90-minute hearing this morning on Colorado Secretary of State
Natalie Meyer's appeal of U.S. District Judge Jim Carrigan's
decision of Sept. 16.
   Carrigan had said petitions circulated in 12 Colorado counties
should have been printed in Spanish and English. The petitions were
printed in English only. He said failure to circulate bilingual
petitions in those counties violated the federal Voting Rights Act
of 1965.
   The decision had thrown the status of the ``official English''
ballot initiative into doubt, because his rejection of petitions
from the 12 counties dropped the number of valid signatures on the
petitions to just 36,874. A total of 50,686 signatures were needed
to get the measure on the ballot.
   But Meyer had placed the proposed amendment on the general
election ballot despite Carrigan's ruling, hoping that her appeal
would be accepted by the 10th Circuit Court.
   After the court ruled today, Meyer said, ``This one will be
voted on. We're through as of today.''
   Carrigan had based his ruling on a portion of the U.S. Voting
Rights Act that requires election literature to be distributed in a
second language in areas where more than 5 percent of the
population has a limited knowledge of English.
   His ruling had been watched closely in other states besides
Colorado, because of concern that it could affect not only other
initiatives on this year's ballot, but laws passed by previous
initiatives.
   In Florida, opponents of an official English amendment in that
state went to federal court to get the measure removed from the
November ballot, citing Carrigan's ruling on bilingual petitions.
   Proposed Amendment 1 says simply: ``An amendment to the Colorado
Constitution to declare that the English language is the official
language of the state of Colorado.''
   Critics have called the proposal racist, while proponents say
that English is a bond that helps hold America's ``melting pot''
together.
   In announcing its decision today, the appeals court said a
written ruling giving details on the reasons for overturning
Carrigan's decision would be issued later.

   A woman has been ordered to appear in
court on a charge that she illegally blocked out the red lobster
and word ``Vacationland'' on her Maine license plates.
   ``Right now, I'm looking into freedom of speech laws,'' said
Pamela Prodan, 37, of Wilton, who said she might hire a lawyer to
represent her in Franklin County District Court on Oct. 25.
   Police had warned Prodan that the plates were illegal before
they stopped her station wagon on Sept. 29, police Chief James
Parker said.
   A state law makes it illegal to obscure numbers, letters, words,
illustrations, seals or other distinguishing marks on vehicle
registration plates. Maximum penalties for violation of the law are
six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Maine plates, introduced in 1987, are decorated with a lobster
and nickname for the state. Some have complained that the new
plates project an affluent image for the state, ignoring Maine's
population of rural poor.

<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday promised a
crackdown on rising crimes of violence, but refused to restore the
death penalty.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told his ruling Conservative Party's
annual convention he would recruit more police, build more prison
space, impose further curbs on drunkenness and introduce electronic
tags to keep track of alleged offenders.
   But his rejection of the death penalty clearly bucked sentiment
at the convention.
   With Hurd and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher looking on,
delegate Lionel Stanbrook ended his pro-death penalty speech by
unexpectedly asking pro-hanging delegates to raise their hands. A
majority did.
   Hanging was abolished in 1969, and attempts to restore it have
been repeatedly defeated ever since.
   ``Don't let's get stuck just in this groove,'' Hurd urged the
delegates. ``Capital punishment can't be the answer to all crime,
or even to violent crime in general.''
   The second day of the convention also dealt with the environment
and energy, and included a pledge by Energy Minister Cecil
Parkinson to sell the state-owned coal industry to private
ownership after the next election, which must be held by 1992.
   But the day's dominant issue was law and order, which is
increasingly preoccupying Tories as police reported a 12 percent
increase in violent crime in England and Wales last year and an 11
percent increase in sexual offenses.
   Electronic tagging would enable authorities to free suspects
instead of locking them in prisons, which already are rated the
most overcrowded in Western Europe.
   The Home Office said the tagging trials would take place in
England and Wales only, and the specific test areas had not been
selected.
   ``The apparatus is relatively simple,'' Hurd explained. ``It
looks ike an electronic bicycle clip, and it works ... If this
project proves successful then we shall take the idea further.''
   He said it could be used for offenders who would otherwise be
remanded in custody, and to enable judges to hand down more
community service sentences.
   ``There should be restrictions on the young thief's leisure
time,'' Hurd said. ``It would do him good to be made to stay at
home during pub opening hours, or on Saturday afternoon while the
football is going on. Electronic monitoring fits in here.''
   The tag, attached to the ankle, transmits a signal to a police
receiver. If the suspect violates his curfew hours, the signal is
broken and he can be rearrested.
   The Howard League for Penal Reform attacked the scheme as
``unnecessary, expensive, ineffective and uncivilized,'' while the
National Association of Probation Officers said U.S. tagging
programs had not reduced the prison population.
   The Tories insist crime is up because school and parental
discipline has declined, while the opposition Labor Party blames it
on Mrs. Thatcher's free-market doctrines, which it says foster
greedy individualism.

   A training exercise for a fire crew at an
Air Force base turned into a life-and-death struggle when a tanker
plane crashed, killing all six crew members and injuring 10
passengers.
   The Air Force said today it hadn't determined the cause of the
crash Tuesday afternoon at Wurtsmith Air Force Base. A board of
officers will be appointed to investigate the crash.
   Wurtsmith, located near Lake Huron, is one of two Michigan bases
in the Strategic Air Command. Nineteen B-52 bombers aryek with
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and nuclear bombs are based at
Wurtsmith.
   The KC-135 Stratotanker, a four-engine plane used to refuel
other planes, was returning to the base from a mission to K.I.
Sawyer Air Force Base in Michigan's Upper Peninsula when it crashed
and burned, said Staff Sgt. Donald Lawber, a spokesman at Wurtsmith
in the northeastern Lower Peninsula.
   The six crew members died at the scene, authorities said. Eight
of the 10 injured were treated and released from the 379th
Strategic Hospital at the base, Staff Sgt. Albert Fleming said. Two
people admitted to the base hospital were in good condition today.
   The base's firefighters had just completed a training exercise
when the accident occurred, and they quickly doused the flames,
said Air Force Sgt. Gene Babble.
   The aircraft was making its landing approach when it crashed
into the tarmac, said Airman Kim Dvorak, another base spokesman.
The plane's pilot had not radioed a distress call before the crash,
she said.
   A witness, who was not identified, told The Detroit News one of
the plane's wings touched the ground as it was landing before it
veered out of control. The plane slammed into the ground, skidded
more than a quarter mile and came to rest in a grassy area about
150 yards off the runway.
   Dvorak said investigators have ruled out wind shear as the cause
of the crash, which occurred in sunny weather with light winds.
Pinpointing the cause will be difficult, she said, because the
plane was not equipped with a flight recorder like the ``black
box'' carried by commercial airliners.
   ``Not much of an airplane was left,'' said state police Sgt.
John Pegg at the East Tawas post. ``Basically, all that was left
was a tail section.''
   The 10 passengers, all military personnel, were being brought to
Wurtsmith from K.I. Sawyer to participate in a base inspection,
part of preparation for an inspection by officials from Strategic
Air Command headquarters in Omaha, Neb., said Anita Bailey,
spokeswoman for K.I. Sawyer.
   The dead crewmen were identified as Capt. Jeffery S. Giles, 27,
of Bunker Hill, W.Va., the pilot; Capt. David B. Greene, 26, of
Lakewood, Colo., the co-pilot; 2nd Lt. Scott J. Szuter, 29, of
Kirtland, Ohio, a navigator; Airman 1st Class Robert L. Parham, 23,
of Fayetteville, N.C., a boom operator; Capt. Gerald D. Earhart,
33, of Montague, Mich., an instructor-navigator; and Capt. William
G. Russell, 33, of Panama City, Fla., an instructor and radar
navigator. All were based at Wurtsmith.
   According to an Air Force fact sheet, the KC-135 is a military
version of the Boeing 707 transport and can fly at near-sonic speed
and altitudes up to 50,000 feet.

<HEAD>Nobel Literature Announcement Thursday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 18 members of the Swedish Academy
made their final deliberations for Thursday's 1988 Nobel literature
prize announcement under pressure to fill some gaps in the award's
87-year history.
   No writer from China has ever won the prestigous prize, despite
that country's 3,000-year literary tradition. The laureate list,
which dates back to 1901, contains just two Asians. Only six women
have ever been honored.
   In keeping with tradition, the academy's secretary, Sture Allen,
announces the winner when a gold clock in the academy's 18th
century office strikes 1 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT).
   The other Nobel prizes are to be announced next week by the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Karolinska Institute.
They include the awards for chemistry, physics, economics and
medicine.
   The peace prize, announced in Oslo, Norway, on Sept. 29, went to
the U.N. peacekeeping forces around the world. This year's prizes
are worth $390,000 each.
   The last woman to win the literature prize was Sweden's Nelly
Sachs, who shared it with a man, S.J. Agnon of Israel, in 1966.
Despite Sweden's ingrained system of sexual equality, men outnumber
women on the academy by 16-2. All members serve for life.
   The last Asian winner was Yasunari Kawabata of Japan in 1968.
From there, the gap stretches back to 1913 and Indian laureate
Rabindranath Tagore.
   ``I would say it is time for a Chinese author,'' said Asa
Beckman, an editor at BLM, one of Sweden's leading literary
magazines. She suggested Bad Jin or female novelist Shen Rong.
   Academy members keep a strict code of secrecy. They never
discuss candidates by name. However, member Goran Malmqvist of
Stockholm University hinted in an interview that this year's choice
should satisfy most people.
   ``I find it hard to imagine any nasty comments,'' he said.
   ``This year we have a short list with extraordinarily worthy
candidates,'' said Malmqvist. ``They all have contributed to world
literature.''
   The academy has been studying the list of less than 10
candidates since before the summer, he said.
   Culture page editors of Sweden's biggest newspapers and
publishing houses admitted they were at loss for a good guess this
year.
   But speculation centered on a handful of favorites, including
Nadine Gordimer of South Africa, and Mexican writers Octavio Paz or
Carlos Fuentes.
   Others mentioned by perennial Nobel watchers included U.S.
author Joyce Carol Oates, Trinidad-born Indian writer V.S. Naipaul,
Japanese authors Yasushi Inove and Kobo Abe, Italy's Alberto
Moravia and Jaan Kross, an Estonian who spent eight years in a
Soviet labor camp in Siberia.
   Then there is Graham Greene. The British writer has been
discussed since the 1960s and has become known as ``the man who did
not get the Nobel prize.''
   According to many accounts, Greene has been blocked by academy
member Artur Lundqvist, who objects that his novels do not raise
literary standards. However, Lundqvist's influence in the academy
is said to have declined since he suffered a serious illness in
1981.
   The Swedish national news agency TT suggested East German author
Christa Wolff, France's Marguerite Duras, Britain's Doris Lessing
and Ana Matute of Spain among the possible female winners.
   ``Will (Allen) once again have to hear the eternal question: Why
don't you ever choose a woman?'' TT said.
   The election of Malmqvist, a Chinese specialist, to the academy
in 1985 reflected an awareness of criticism for having a decidedly
pro-European or Western slant.
   The following year the prize went for the first time to an
African, Nigeria's Wole Soyinka.
   Alfred Nobel, who made his fortune from inventing dynamite and
other explosives, stipulated in his will that the prize be awarded
to the author who produced ``the most outstanding work of an ideal
tendency.'' Nobel died in 1896.
   His words have been interpreted differently by the generations
of academies. In the first decades after World War II the prize was
awarded to modernists, such as the poet T.S. Eliot, and to
established writers such as Bertrand Russel.
   In the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, the prize was used
to draw attention to masters who wrote for a limited audience and
were unknown worldwide, such as Czech poet Jaroslav Seifert in 1984
and Greek writer Odysseus Elytis, the 1981 laureate.
   The laureates will be given their awards in Stockholm Dec. 10.
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is to accept the
peace prize in Oslo on the same day, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

<TEXT>
   Two men charged with the 1983 murder of a New
York producer who was trying to finance ``The Cotton Club'' movie
have pleaded innocent, denying allegations that could bring the
death penalty.
   William Molony Mentzer and Alex Lamota Marti are accused of
gunning down producer Roy Radin, who authorities say was targeted
for death in connection with his unsuccessful attempt to finance
the film.
   Mentzer and Marti pleaded innocent Tuesday to murder and special
circumstance allegations of committing murder for financial gain
and lying in wait for the victim. They could face the death penalty
if convicted.
   Municipal Court Judge David S. Milton set a Nov. 7 hearing for
motions preceding a preliminary hearing.
   Five defendants, including Mentzer and Marti, are named in a
complaint dealing with the murders of Radin and of a prostitute,
June Mincher. Marti and Karen DeLayne Greenberger are not charged
in the Mincher killing, which was unrelated to Radin's death.
   Mrs. Greenberger, a key figure in the Radin allegations, is
fighting extradition from Florida. Another defendant, Robert Ulmer
Lowe, is awaiting extradition proceedings in Maryland.
   Robert Leroy Deremer, charged only in the Mincher killing, was
returned here from Indiana on Tuesday after waiving extradition.
   Prosecutors allege that Mrs. Greenberger, formerly known as
Elaine Jacobs, ordered Radin's execution after a dispute over her
financial cut of the movie, ``The Cotton Club.''
   Mrs. Greenberger, who authorities said was involved in cocaine
dealing, allegedly introduced Radin to movie producer Robert Evans,
who was then seeking financing for the film about the legendary
Harlem night spot.
   Radin, 33, who had produced vaudeville shows in New York, saw
``The Cotton Club'' as his chance to enter the Hollywood big time,
prosecutors said. He was embroiled in a deal to raise $35 million
for the film from Puerto Rican investors when he disappeared May
13, 1983.
   Radin failed to show up that night for a dinner at a swank
Beverly Hills restaurant. A month later, his bullet-riddled body
was found dumped in a rural area 60 miles from Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Dukakis Needs to Get the Debate Onto His Issues _ and With a Smile</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Closer but still trailing after the campaign's
first two debates, Michael Dukakis faces George Bush in Los Angeles
Thursday in what may be the Democrats' last chance to move the
presidential race onto their issues.
   And, importantly, to do it with a smile.
   In the final debate before the election, each candidate would
love to land a knockout blow, to be so eloquent and impressive or
to so damage his rival that the race for the presidency would be
greatly altered.
   That's not likely, however.
   Bush, with an apparent lead in the Electoral College that
exceeds his narrowing margin in national polls, needs this debate
less than the Democratic nominee and Massachusetts governor.
   The vice president has no doubt been spending some time
preparing a retort for any jibes Dukakis might make about his
selection of Dan Quayle as running mate.
   Quayle, Bush said in the first presidential debate, will do
``very well when we get into the debates'' _ something polls agree
Quayle did not do in the vice-presidential face-off last week.
   For Dukakis, as the underdog and as the challenger who
represents change, 90 minutes on a stage with Bush before a
national television audience poses a last opportunity.
   Dukakis forces see the debate as his chance to confront Bush on
the negative charges the Republican campaign has been heaping on
him. Dukakis tried that in the first debate when he accused Bush of
questioning his patriotism and declared, ``I resent it.''
   Bush since has moved on, pummeling Dukakis anew over the
Massachusetts prison furlough program.
   Dukakis showed anger last weekend at the suggestion he was
insensitive to victims of crime, and his aides said they hope to
keep the nominee angry.
   ``Stop this shameless playing of politics with the tragedy of
crime,'' Dukakis said in a line he's likely to replay to Bush.
   Answering the other guy's charges isn't usually enough, though.
   Many Democrats say Dukakis still needs to make the case for
himself on the issues of his choosing _ principally the economy.
And he needs to show some warmth, passion, and even humor in the
process.
   Polls after their first debate indicated many people credited
Dukakis with his grasp of the issues. But they also suggested many
didn't find much they liked in the often-dour Dukakis.
   In his first debate, Dukakis's main fault may have been his
passionless answer to the question about his lack of passion.
   ``I care deeply about people,'' he said, in a phrase he
repeated. ``I may be a little calmer than some about it.''
   Dukakis has been frustrated so far in making his economic themes
connect with voters. He is trying to make a point that prosperity
isn't reaching many Americans, and that the economic future is
clouded.
   His thematic phrase has been changing almost weekly in an effort
to find one that resonates: ``Bringing prosperity home,'' ``Middle
class squeeze,'' and now, ``Make America No. 1.''
   Advisers want Dukakis to paint Bush as the candidate of the
wealthy and privileged, of Wall Street and big business. Some of
Dukakis' best moments on the stump have come when he tried that.
   ``George Bush plays Santa Claus to the wealthy and Ebenezer
Scrooge to the rest of us,'' Dukakis said recently, holding a $20
bill aloft in ridicule of the savings provided to middle-class
Americans by Bush's tax-deferred savings account plan.
   Look for Dukakis to repeat that one, too.
   ``They've got to draw a clear line of which candidate is on your
side,'' said Frank Greer, a Democratic consultant who has advised
Dukakis on the debates. ``They've failed in doing that so far,
mainly because they've been on the defensive.''

<HEAD>Effort to Abolish S&L Assets Disposition Agency Falls Short</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House refused Wednesday to abolish the
much-criticized federal agency created to manage and sell off the
worst assets of insolvent savings institutions.
   The House voted 247-130 to approve the measure. Under the
procedure used, however, two-thirds of those voting had to be in
favor of the legislation for passage, and the House failed to reach
that margin by five votes.
   Even if the House had approved the bill, there was little chance
for passage by the Senate, which hasn't considered such legislation.
   The Federal Assets Disposition Administration, a quasi-public
organization, was formed by the Federal Home Loan Bank in 1985 to
assist the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in the
management and disposition of acquired assets.
   Lawmakers have accused it of favoritism, conflicts of interest
and mismanagement of the $3.9 billion in loans and real estate in
its care.
   FADA was criticized bitterly for paying salaries as high as
$250,000 annually, cloaking its activities in secret and failing to
dispose of many of the assets placed in its custody.
   The House Banking Committee approved the bill on Oct. 4 by a
vote of 42-8, with all the negative votes coming from Republicans
who see the legislation as a political measure rather than
substantive action.
   The legislation would have given the bank board 60 days to close
FADA and limit severence pay for employees to about $4,700, or
three weeks' salary, rather than the four months' pay pledged by
the agency early this year.
   The bill, similar to a section of the omnibus banking
legislation approved by the House in August, would have assigned
FADA's activities to FSLIC, the government insurance fund that
backs S&L deposits up to $100,000.
   Reps. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., and Tom McMillen, D-Md., introduced
the legislation.
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., Banking Committee chairman
and floor manager for the bill, said in debate that his panel had
been investigating FADA for the past 15 months.
   ``Our findings clearly establish that this agency has become a
wasteful bureaucracy, lacing in accountability, and providing an
inefficient means of disposing of property acquired from failed
savings and loan associations,'' he said.
   ``High salaries, big expense accounts and CIA-like secrecy have
become the agency's claims to fame during its three-year
existence.''

<HEAD>Governor Gives Optimistic Picture of Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Sir David Wilson on Wednesday delivered an
optimistic review on conditions in Hong Kong, but said problems
exist and they must be solved to retain the prosperity and dynamism
of this British colony.
   In an annual address opening a new session of the Legislative
Council, Hong Kong's chief lawmaking body, Wilson said he was
confident about the colony's economic growth despite public concern
over its return to China in 1997 when a territorial lease expires.
   He said Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product was expected to grow
by 6 percent this year, or half the 1987 figure, but explained this
was the result of economic consolidation following earlier years of
double digit growth.
   ``Hong Kong has prospered over the past decades by maintaining
an open economy,'' he said. ``Nevertheless, we have to recognize
that we are dependent not just on ourselves but on the economic
performance of our major overseas markets and on our continued
access to them.''
   As an example of concern, Wilson singled out an unsuccessful
attempt by the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month to
override President Reagan's veto on legislation to tighten curbs on
textile imports to the United States.
   ``We must continue to be aware of, and guard against,
protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress,'' he said.
   Hong Kong exported roughly $4.3 billion worth of apparel and
textile goods to the United States last year. It was the single
largest category in exports that totaled $9.2 billion.
   Wilson said Sino-Hong Kong relations are developing well.
   Wilson said Hong Kong still faces a problem over the
resettlement of Vietnamese boat people, who continue to arrive
despite a government policy to repatriate to Vietnam those regarded
as economic migrants and not genuine refugees.
   He said 133,00 boat people have arrived in Hong Kong since the
fall of Vietnam to the communists in 1975. There are roughly 25,000
still in Hong Kong, but Wilson said their rate of resettlement to
other countries has dropped sharply in recent years.
   ``The tragedy is that doors are no longer open for them,'' he
said. ``They are people on a journey to nowhere.''

   The Supreme Court was urged Wednesday to
uphold a key 1976 civil rights decision and not retreat in the
fight to eliminate ``the badges of slavery'' in American society.
   Julius LeVonne Chambers of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education
Fund said the court's 12-year-old ruling conforms with a law
Congress passed in 1866 to eradicate racial discrimination in the
wake of emancipation.
   ``Congress had egregious conduct to correct'' after the Civil
War, Chambers said. And, he continued, ``Congress meant to reach
the type of conduct'' at issue in Wednesday's case.
   Chambers, who is black, said, ``We're not working on the farms
now. We're working in credit unions. But the badges of slavery were
what Congress was trying to reach.''
   The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was intended to ensure recently
freed slaves all the rights of citizenship.
   Chambers is representing a North Carolina woman who accused her
former employer, McLean Credit Union, of racial harassment. The
case has attracted as much attention as any in the court's new term
begun last week.
   Civil rights advocates say they are concerned it might signal a
willingness by a newly solidified conservative court majority to
wipe out gains made by minorities over the last 30 years.
   The justices are deciding whether they mistakenly ruled in 1976
that the 1866 law authorizes suits against private citizens accused
of discrimination.
   The court is expected to announce its decision next year.
   Roger S. Kaplan, a New York lawyer representing McLean Credit
Union, said the 1866 law ``would not reach private acts of
discrimination'' and the court in 1976 interfered with the will of
Congress in extending the reach of the old statute.
   Kaplan received sharp questioning from the justices when he said
the proper course now for the court was to abandon precedent and
reverse its 12-year-old ruling.
   Justice Antonin Scalia said Kaplan must come up with something
more than the argument that the 1976 ruling interfered with
congressional prerogatives.
   ``If that's all you have, I'm afraid it's nothing,'' Scalia said.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court's newest member and
potentially a decisive swing vote in the case, asked Chambers where
the court should draw the line in applying the 1866 law.
   Could it be invoked, he asked, to sue an employer for using a
racial epithet? ``Where's the controlling principle,'' Kennedy
asked?
   Chambers said the law would apply if the use of the epithet
demonstrated an intent to discriminate and was not an isolated
occurence.
   The court sent shock waves through the civil rights community
last April when it announced it would use the credit union case to
consider reversing the 1976 decision, called Runyon vs. McCrary.
   While no party to the North Carolina case urged the court to
reconsider the 1976 precedent, the justices by a 5-4 vote took the
extraordinary step of acting on their own initiative to call for a
reexamination.
   Kennedy and Scalia were in the majority, along with Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and
Byron R. White.
   The dissenters said the move threatened to undermine the faith
minorities have placed in the high court.
   In Runyon vs. McCrary, the court held that racially segregated
private schools which refuse to admit blacks violate the 1866 law.
   The ruling allows civil rights groups to use the 1866 law as a
weapon to attack private discrimination in all forms.
   For example, no other federal law bars racially segregated
private schools. Also, the law provides for heavy punitive damages
against those found to have practiced discrimination.
   That is of particular importance in job bias cases which account
for some three-fourths of the suits filed under the 1866 law.
Congress in 1964 outlawed on-the-job discrimination, but did not
provide for such heavy penalties.
   The 1866 law also is a key recourse for those challenging bias
in the sale of private homes.
   The attorneys general of nearly every state, a majority of U.S.
senators, more than 100 House members and more than 100 civil
rights and public interest groups are urging the court not to
tamper with the 1976 ruling.
   The Reagan administration has not taken an official position in
the dispute.
   The case stems from an appeal by Brenda Patterson, a black woman
who was a teller at McLean Credit Union. She sued under the 1866
law, seeking actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986 upheld a ruling by
a federal judge in Winston-Salem, N.C., throwing out her suit.

   Oscar-winning actress Shirley MacLaine, who
claims to have lived several past lives, says people no longer
think of her as a kook.
   Miss MacLaine has written seven books, most of them on her
metaphysical and spiritual beliefs.
   Despite a recent clash on the subject with David Letterman on
his TV talk show, Miss MacLaine said she encounters less resistance
to her beliefs these days.
   ``I don't think the term `kook' comes into it anymore. I think
we're all beyond that now,'' she said recently. ``People certainly
are still skeptical, but all we're talking about is the belief in
your own internal power, and that's not kooky. To call it wacko is
to call the spiritual belief of 2 billion people wacko.''
   Miss MacLaine, who won an Academy Award for her role in the 1983
film ``Terms of Endearment,'' stars in her first movie since then,
``Madame Sousatzka,'' which opens Friday. She plays a domineering
music teacher.

   Burt Reynolds can use the lush backdrop
of Palm Beach for his new television series, but city leaders have
put a few obstacles in his way.
   Reynolds, who will play a private investigator in the as-yet
untitled series, cannot film at the police station and three other
sites he had requested because it would interfere with traffic, the
Town Council decided Tuesday.
   Also, the Worth Avenue shooting must be moved up six days in
November so it doesn't interfere with Thanksgiving shopping at the
famous shopping promenade.
   ``This isn't Hollywood,'' Councilman Bernard Heeke told Alan
Barnette, a producer with Blue Period Productions. ``We don't
intend it to be.''
   The film company plans to film six two-hour TV movies for ABC.
The executive producers of the show are Reynolds and actor Tom
Selleck in his first TV project since ``Magnum, P.I.''
   The tone of the show, said Rob Maass, attorney for the
production company, ``is more `Magnum, P.I.' than `Miami Vice.'''
Reynolds, he said, would play his part with more humor, fewer guns
and less violence.
   ``Burt Reynolds is a native son of Palm Beach County and a
longtime supporter of the arts here,'' Maass said. ``He wants to
portray this area in a positive light.''

   Actress Robin Givens plans to meet with
estranged husband Mike Tyson this weekend to discuss a possible
settlement of her divorce action against the heavyweight champion,
according to a published report Wednesday.
   New York Newsday quoted Raoul Felder, Miss Givens' attorney, as
saying the meeting may take place in New York and that he was
hopeful that either a reconciliation or a settlement could be
worked out between the couple.
   Felder also decried criticism from the Tyson camp that his
client was after the boxer's money. ``When someone is called a
golddigger in my book they're asking for money. In my 30
conversations with Miss Givens she has never asked about money,''
he said.
   The New York Daily News reported, meanwhile, that Tyson's right
hand was back in a cast. The cast was put on by a Cleveland doctor,
but it was unclear whether the injury was new or a fracture at the
same spot broken during an August street scuffle, the paper said.
   Tyson, 22, is staying at the farm of promoter Don King east of
Cleveland and was unavailable for comment. A security guard
answering the phone at the King complex said he was authorized only
to take messages.

   An international conference concluded
Wednesday that the warming of the Earth from the ``greenhouse
effect'' is a crisis requiring massive scientific and political
coordination to stem the burning of fossil fuels and halve the
emissions of carbon dioxide by the year 2030.
   The effort must entail fundamental changes in lifestyle,
including a rapid switch to solar, wind and other ``environmentally
sound'' energy sources, new farming techniques and the abandonment
of some chemical products, the conference said.
   It also recommended that the industrial nations forgive certain
debts of the Third World, as an incentive for poorer nations to
conserve and replenish their tropical forests.
   Representatives from 35 nations attended the three-day, Global
Greenhouse Network First International Conference to formulate
recommendations for heading off what many scientists have warned
could be a disastrous overheating of the Earth.
   ``This crisis is of such overwhelming magnitude that it will
require a truly global response,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, president of
the Foundation on Economic Trends, which sponsored the meeting.
   The greenhouse effect is a warming of the Earth caused by the
increasing concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases in the
atmosphere.
   The gases, largely a result of burning fossil fuels like coal
and oil, allow radiation from the sun to warm the planet, but block
excess heat from radiating back into space. The effect is similar
to that of a greenhouse for growing plants.
   ``Global warming is already occurring ... and the planet faces
the possibility of profound disruption in the coming decades,''
said Philip Michael Kelly, a climatologist from the University of
East Anglia in Norwich, England.
   Scientists have warned that the consequences of even a slight
global warming could include increased droughts and other severe
effects upon crop production. Moreover, they say it could melt the
ice caps, threatening coastal areas with higher seas, and even
produce stronger hurricanes in future years.
   Among the other recommendations of the conference:
   _Taxes on use of carbon-based fuels and other penalties for
damaging the environment, targeted at industrialized nations. The
money raised from these penalties would go to an international fund
to assist nations seeking ways to cope with climate change.
   _Rejection of nuclear, genetic-engineering and other
high-technology responses to the climate problem.
   _Tax incentives and legislation to discourage use of
chlorofluorocarbons, a type of chemical used in refrigerators and
other industrial processes which can damage the environment.
   _Reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide by one-fifth by the
year 2000, and by half by 2030.
   _Tax incentives and legislation to encourage energy efficiency
and conservation in industrial, residential and commercial uses.
   _A switch by agriculture away from petrochemical fertilizers to
organic products.
   ``It is recognized that these goals cannot be achieved without
fundamental changes in lifestyle and consumption patterns in the
industrialized world and structural changes in socio-economic
relationships worldwide, '' the conference concluded.
   The group also announced plans for a celebration of Global Earth
Day in 1990, and designation of the 1990s as the Environmental
Decade.

   Nigeria's military leader on Wednesday
announced a new campaign aimed at weeding out corrupt officials in
top government circles and commercial banks.
   Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who seized power from another military
leader in 1985, would not detail what form the campaign would take.
   In his comments to the country's attorney generals, Babangida
said corrupt officials would be punished and that the Ministry of
Justice was working on new decrees and regulations for the campaign.
   The president said he particularly was concerned about personal
enrichment by government officials and bankers. He said if it was
not curbed now, corruption could be permanently entrenched by the
time his military government handed power over to a civilian
government in 1992.

   NASA officials hope that a
disassembled spacecraft sitting in crates at a hangar Wednesday
will be en route to Venus by April as America's first
interplanetary explorer in 11 years.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration showed off the
scattered pieces of the Magellan spacecraft to reporters and
photographers four days after the spacecraft's arrival by truck
from the Martin Marietta plant in Denver.
   If all goes well, the parts will be assembled and checked out
over the next few months and then transported to the launch pad in
March to be loaded aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, said Jo Ann
Morgan, the Kennedy Space Center's director of payloads projects
management.
   The scheduled launch date is April 28.
   NASA will have only 25 days, until May 23, to get Atlantis off
the pad before Venus moves out of its favorable alignment with
Earth. Otherwise the Magellan voyage will have to be delayed about
two years, said Charles Brown, Magellan program manager for Martin
Marietta, which built the probe for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Once the shuttle is in orbit, the crew will release Magellan
from the cargo bay and a rocket will start it on the 466-day trip
to Venus.
   It will be the first planetary probe launched from a shuttle as
well as the first U.S. planetary mission since two Pioneer
spacecraft were dispatched in 1978 to study Venus' atmosphere.
   Magellan is to settle into an elliptical orbit around Venus
ranging from 155 miles to 1,180 miles above the surface. Each
circuit of the planet will take 3.1 days, and during the 40 minutes
the craft is nearest the surface, an advanced radar will peer
through the constant cloud layer and obtain images of the surface,
which will be relayed to an Earth station.
   During each orbit, the radar, supplied by Hughes Aircraft Co.,
will map a swath of surface 15 miles wide and 10,000 miles long.
Brown said it would take 1,853 such swaths, recorded over 243 days,
to chart the entire planet.
   ``The spacecraft will be conducting basic research about how
Venus was formed,'' Brown told a news conference. ``To find out, we
need to know the topography of the planet.
   ``We now have the topography of Earth, the moon, Mars and
Mercury, but we don't have the topography of Venus because of the
cloud cover,'' he said. ``The imaging radar will give us that
topography.''
   Brown said Magellan will enable scientists for the first time to
study detailed images of Venus like those formed by wind or flowing
liquid, craters and large landslides.
   While Venus is Earth's closest neighbor in the solar system, the
two planets are vastly different. Venus has a surface temperature
of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, its atmopshere is almost entirely
carbon dioxide, and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of
Earth.
   Brown said one goal of the mission is to try to learn why the
two planets evolved so differently.

<HEAD>Joint Delegation To Consider Security Problems in West Sudan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chad and Sudan are joining forces against
bandit gangs from both countries whose looting and robbing rampages
in recent months have resulted in hundreds of deaths in western
Sudan.
   Among targeted warlords is Acheikh Ibn Omar, once designated by
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi as Chad's president, whose army
of 2,000 renegades is said to be hiding out in Sudan.
   A Chadian-Sudanese committee went this week to Fasher, capital
of the west's main region Darfur, to meet with Ibn Omar and leaders
of other armed Chadian factions. The Chadian delegation has been in
Sudan since Saturday, discussing ways to improve security near the
frontier to stop infiltration of armed bands.
   Border insecurity has bedeviled Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's
civilian government almost ever since it took power in Sudan in
1986 from a junta that had ruled for a year after a coup.
   Brigadier Mahmoud Haren Hamad, Darfur's chief of police, said
more than 3,000 civilians and at least 100 policemen have been
killed by armed robbers in the region since 1984. Early this year,
he said, six or seven armed robberies were occurring every day.
   Mahdi and others have complained bitterly of the spillover of
the war between Libya and Chad. They have charged that soldiers
from both countries have sought in Sudan a haven from the fighting,
with easy pickings for robbery, or have used Sudanese territory as
a short cut between Libya and the battle fronts in Chad.
   Despite his outwardly friendly relations with Gadhafi, the prime
minister ordered Libyan troops out of Sudan in 1985 and again the
next year. Some of the 2,000 originally in Sudan are thought still
to remain.
   Gadhafi declared the prolonged war ended in May and resumed
diplomatic relations this month with the government of Hissene
Habre, formerly his bitter enemy.
   Sudanese officials have announced several times that the members
of Ibn Omar's troops had surrendered their weapons to the army.
Last week, however, Cabinet Affairs Minister Salah Abdul-Salam
admitted that only 955 men had turned in their weapons and said the
government doesn't know the whereabouts of the rest of the 2,000
men.
   But Tigani Sysi, Darfur's governor, told The Associated Press
they have entered the Jabal Mara mountains near Fasher, where they
are looting and robbing Sudanese villages and travelers.
   He said there are 32 different bandit gangs in western Sudan.
   The cooperative Sudanese-Chadian effort follows a series of
fruitless tries by the Sudanese alone.
   Last month, the cabinet committee decided to close Sudan's
frontiers with both Libya and Chad, but such a task is almost
impossible considering that the 1,000-mile border is almost all
desert.

   Cuban officials escorted a seized U.S. merchant
ship carrying New Zealand's America's Cup racing yacht into
international waters today, where the vessel apparently resumed its
trip to New York, the Coast Guard said.
   Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Karonis said the Tampa Sea Horse departed
from the Cuban port at 11:40 a.m. Havana time (12:40 p.m. EDT) and
the Cuban pilots left 20 minutes later.
   ``They said they were seized, the vessel was inspected and their
passports were checked,'' Karonis said after the Coast Guard talked
to the ship by radio. ``The Cubans claimed their vessel was nine
miles offshore,'' Karonis said, quoting the crew. Cuba claims a
12-mile territorial limit.
   ``The information we have right now is that they are still going
to New York,'' he said. ``We have not been asked to meet them.''
   Earlier today, a press aide to Connecticut Sen. Lowell Weicker
said his office had been told by the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington that the eight Americans and one New Zealander aboard
were ``safe and well.''
   The spokesman for the Cuban mission was not available to answer
questions about the incident, which began Tuesday afternoon when
the Cubans seized the ship after it allegedly entered Cuban
territorial waters.
   The ship was detained Tuesday in Puerto Cayo Moa, Cuba, said
Coast Guard spokesman Dan Vogeley in Miami. The dissembled sloop
New Zealand was aboard the 160-foot U.S.-registered merchant ship,
officials said.
   The 133-foot yacht was en route from San Diego, Calif., to New
York City for a tour of East Coast cities.
   The Cubans seized the vessel off the southeastern tip of Cuba
without firing shots or using force, saying it had violated the
communist country's 12-mile territorial limit, the Coast Guard said.
   Capt. Jeff Jappe radioed an urgent appeal Tuesday at 3 p.m. EDT
to the Coast Guard, insisting he was in international waters, but
Coast Guard officers advised him to comply with the Cubans, Vogeley
said.
   Lowell Oswald, a spokesman for the Tampa Sea Horse's agent,
Zapata Marine of New Orleans, said he didn't know why the ship was
seized but also maintained it was in international waters.
   ``We're at as much of a loss as anyone else,'' Oswald said.
   San Diego-based Sail America managed the successful U.S. defense
of the America's Cup race by sailing the catamaran Stars & Stripes
against the single-hulled New Zealand last month off San Diego.
   Michael Fay, chairman of the New Zealand Challenge, forced the
San Diego Yacht Club into an early defense of the cup this year
after winning a court order that validated his challenge of race
rules.
   The New Zealand was twice as long as the traditional 12-meter
yachts used in cup competitions. The San Diego club responded by
building a dual-hulled catamaran to defend the Cup, and Dennis
Conner skippered the Stars & Stripes to two easy victories to sweep
a best-of-three series.
   Oswald estimated the Tampa Sea Horse's value at $3 million, but
said he didn't know what the sailing vessel was worth.

   The next president could very well be forced
to preside over a sharp decline in U.S. living standards unless he
acts quickly to deal with pressing international economic problems,
two staff members of the private Council on Foreign Relations said
Wednesday.
   The president's ability to deal with economic problems has been
fundamentally altered by the fact that financial markets have
coalesced into a single worldwide market, the specialists wrote in
a new book, ``After Reagan: Confronting the Changed World Economy.''
   ``The next president will face more difficult constraints and
more difficult choices than any of his predecessors over the last
40 years,'' C. Michael Aho, one of the authors, told reporters at a
briefing.
   ``A president must face the voters only once every four years,
but he must face the judgment of the markets every business day,''
said Aho, who is director of economic studies for the council. ``If
he doesn't have a credible economic policy, markets could react,
sending the dollar plunging and interest rates soaring.''
   Aho and his co-author, Marc Levinson, pointed to the worldwide
collapse of stock markets last Oct. 19 as a warning of what can
happen if investors lose confidence in the ability of governments
to manage their international affairs.
   Because of the huge trade deficits of the 1980s, the United
States has transferred billions of dollars into the hands of
foreigners to pay for imported televisions and cars.
   That situation has transformed the United States from the
world's largest creditor nation to the largest debtor country,
meaning that foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than Americans
own in foreign assets.
   Aho and Levinson predicted that this imbalance between U.S. and
foreign ownership of assets will hit $1 trillion in the early
1990s. The country's net foreign obligations stood at $368.2
billion at the end of 1987.
   A net debt poses the risk of lowering the U.S. standard of
living because Americans will have to transfer between $40 billion
and $50 billion annually overseas in debt service to foreigners,
money that will not be available in this country, the authors said.
   Oho said the flow of foreign capital into the United States has
helped to finance a consumption binge as Americans and the
government spent more than they were earning.
   ``We are going to have to slow down our excess consumption and
start servicing our debt,'' he said.
   The authors made the following policy recommendations for the
next president:
   _The federal budget deficit, which totaled an estimated $150
billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, should be cut over
the next four years through a combination of tax increases and cuts
in defense spending and benefit programs such as Social Security
and Medicare.
   _Growing pressures to erect protectionist trade barriers should
be resisted. But they said American trade negotiators need to be
tougher in getting other nations to open their markets to U.S.
goods so that this country will be able to run a surplus in
merchandise trade to help service the deficit it will have in
investment earnings.
   _The policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund need a major overhaul in the area of Third World debt. The two
organizations should be focusing their efforts on ways to reduce
the $1.2 trillion debt of developing nations rather than pursuing
endless strategies of rescheduling the debt payments.
   _The United States should abandon its effort with other major
countries to prop up the value of the dollar and instead allow
market forces to drive it lower. The authors said without a further
dollar devaluation, America's trade deficit will not be eliminated.
   Aho said foreign capital markets will force the next president
to deal with these problems very early in his term or risk a
precipitous drop in the dollar caused by foreign investors losing
confidence in the United States.
   ``You get a sense that foreign investors are waiting for Jan. 21
to see whether the next president will make the hard policy choices
that will be needed,'' he said.
   The Council on Foreign Affairs is a research organization that
conducts studies on international issues.

<HEAD>North's Lawyers Say Charges Rise From `Novel Theories'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North's lawyers accused Iran-Contra
prosecutors Wednesday of spinning ``novel theories of criminality''
to improperly charge the former presidential aide with illegal
conduct.
   In a virtual blizzard of motions to dismiss the 16 counts
against North, defense lawyers argued that independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh ``formulated new legal doctrines criminalizing
conduct in the sensitive areas of foreign affairs and interbranch
relations.''
   The defense also argued that the former National Security
Council aide did not receive ``fair warning'' he could be
prosecuted for making misleading statements in unsworn replies to
congressional queries about covert aid to the Contras.
   Such charges are unprecedented and were not made after false
statements by government officials about such covert operations as
the U-2 spy plane shot down by the Russians in 1960 and the CIA's
support of Indonesian rebels in 1958, the defense contended.
   Allegations that North and three co-defendants illegally
diverted proceeds of U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels
rest on the faulty premise that the conspiracy violated the
congressional ban on aid to the Contras known as the Boland
Amendment, the defense said.
   Walsh ``could not more blatantly _ or improperly _ formulate
policies for the government'' than to charge North after President
Reagan had determined that the Boland Amendment did not apply to
the National Security Council staff, the defense said.
   Nor was the conspiracy to defraud the government of proceeds
from the arms sales a valid charge because there is no proof that
the government was deprived of its ``property right'' to the
proceeds of those transactions, the defense said.
   The major charges ``rest on entirely novel theories of
criminality and wholly unprecedented applications of substantive
statutes,'' the defense said in filing 28 motions late Tuesday. The
motions were note made public until Wednesday. Nine other motions
were filed under seal.
   Defense lawyers noted that North's allegedly false statements
denying his role in helping the Contras were made at an
off-the-record session with members of the House Select Permanent
Committee on Intelligence or were incorporated in written responses
to House committees sent by the National Security Council in 1985
and 1986.
   Congress never intended that an official could be charged for
making unsworn statements, and Walsh's decision ``to prosecute such
informal exchanges... promises to transform interbranch relations
by criminalizing the winks and nods that characterize interbranch
communications,'' the defense said.
   Such charges impose on the executive branch ``the duty to be
forthcoming to Congress on pain of criminal prosecution, not just
political embarrassment,'' defense lawyers Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.
and Barry Simon said in the pleadings.
   The defense motions also attacked the validity of charges that
North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and two
arms dealers, Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
V. Secord, defrauded the government by diverting arms-sale profits
to the Contras.
   Secord acted as an agent of the U.S. government and ensured that
the CIA was paid the prices it charged for the weapons sold to
Iran, the defense said. The defendants therefore cannot be charged
with defrauding the government by diverting profits made during the
arms sales to Iran, the defense charged.
   Separate trials have been ordered for each of the defendants and
North is set to be tried first. U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell has not set a trial date.
   A charge that North defrauded the government by using a
tax-exempt foundation to help raise $3.2 million for the Contras
rests on a controversial assumption that donations to the rebels
couldn't be deducted as charitable contributions from donors'
income taxes, the defense said.
   Walsh ignored ``repeated admonitions from the courts that
`pioneering interpretations' of tax liability should be pursued
civilly rather than criminally,'' the defense said.
   The independent counsel ``stretched the limits of the
conspiracy-to-defraud statute to charge Lt. Col. North on the basis
of a legal theory that no court has ever endorsed.''
   The retired Marine officer never received ``fair notice'' that
his fund-raising would result in criminal prosecution, the defense
contended.

   A former Marine aboard a hijacked
TWA jetliner tearfully told a court Wednesday that he was convinced
his wife and children thought he had been killed during the 1985
air piracy.
   Robert G. Brown also testified at the trial of Mohammed Ali
Hamadi that the Shiite Moslem and an accomplice raced through the
plane beating passengers at random.
   The two Lebanese men seized the Athens-to-Rome flight on June
14, 1985, and diverted it to Beirut and Algiers. Thirty-nine
Americans were held for 17 days during the ordeal.
   ``I was afraid that my wife and children thought I was dead,''
said Brown, choking back tears.
   Brown, 45, said he and other hostages were allowed to read
magazines after they had been removed from the plane in Beirut,
where U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot by the hijackers and
tossed out on the runway to die. The hijackers screamed ``Marine!''
at Stethem while he was beaten and before he was shot, witnesses
have said.
   ``At this time I realized that my wife had been told I was
killed because I had been a Marine and it was published that a
Marine had been killed,'' said Brown.
   Hamadi is being tried for murder and air piracy in a heavily
guarded courtroom in a Frankfurt's Preungesheim prison, which is
surrounded by police with submachine guns.
   Brown described the first minutes after the jetliner was seized.
   ``One man had a pistol in one hand and a grenade in the other,''
Brown said, referring to alleged kidnapper Hassan Ezzeddine, who is
still at large.
   ``The other man (Hamadi) had a hand grenade in his hand. I saw a
(grenade) pin on the floor of the plane, which to be honest with
you, frightened the hell out of me,'' Brown said.
   He said he saw the hijackers running through the plane striking
passengers.
   ``I was able to see numerous times the brutality that both of
the hijackers inflicted on the passengers. They were hitting them
right and left.''
   He said they sometimes leaned on the backs of seats and kicked
passengers.
   Brown said he was later taken off the plane in Beirut along with
other passengers and taken to a ``slum house,'' where other captors
interrogated them.
   ``We were taken later to an underground prison. For the first
seven days we did not brush our teeth, or wash or change our
clothes. There were no newspapers and no news,'' Brown said.
   The hostages were moved again to a third location where they
were finally allowed to wash and read magazines, he said.
   He said the hijackers appeared well-trained for their mission.
   ``The initial movements to take over the plane were done with
such professionalism ... that without a doubt they controlled that
plane,'' Brown said.
   Hamadi sat quietly throughout the testimony, listening to his
court-appointed interpreer.
   Brown, who said he worked for a medical equipment company, was
not asked by the court to reveal his residence under court
guidelines for the protection of witnesses.
   On Tuesday, American Leo Byron tearfully recounted how hijackers
hit and kicked crouching passengers, including himself and his
teen-age daughter.
   He also provided more description of how Stethem was severely
beaten before he was fatally shot.
   ``His face was puffy. He was very raw or bloody in the neck
area. He appeared to be dazed,'' said Byron, 52.
   Byron said he did not see who fired the shot that killed
Stethem. Hamadi admits he was one of the hijackers but denies
killing Stethem.
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, have attended
each session of the trial, which began July 5.
   Hamadi was arrested Jan. 13, 1987, at Frankfurt airport after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   West Germany last year rejected a U.S. extradition request for
Hamadi, saying he would be tried in this country instead.

campaign, and George Bush wants to expand Medicaid coverage for the
poor.
   But both candidates have shied away from detailed prescriptions
for a host of other intractable medical problems that will confront
the next president, from the AIDS crisis to long-term care to the
soaring costs of Medicare.
   ``Health care is an issue that most Americans are very concerned
about, and the candidates have not spent a lot of time on it,''
said John Rother, legislative director for the American Association
of Retired Persons.
   Although neither Bush nor Dukakis has owned up to it, the $87
billion Medicare program _ which provides health insurance for 28
million elderly and 3 million disabled workers _ is almost certain
to be a prime target for deficit-reduction in the next Congress.
   Physicians' fees under Medicare have risen at a 15 percent
annual clip, and Congress is already studying ways to move away
from the traditional method of reimbursing doctors for whatever
their customary charges are.
   ``They've been rather quiet about what they would do with
Medicare. Our concern on Medicare is that you can't keep ratcheting
that program down and expect access for the elderly to continue,''
said Jack Owen, executive vice president of the American Hospital
Association.
   But health analyst Jack Meyer said, ``The next administration,
if they're serious about budget control, has to put health care on
the table.''
   Americans spent $497 billion on health care in 1987, or 11.2
percent of the gross national product, a far larger share of GNP
than any other industrialized country.
   Still, 37 million Americans have no health insurance, most of
them in families with someone in the workforce. They are not old
enough for Medicare nor, in most cases, poor enough for Medicaid.
   The ranks of the uninsured have grown rapidly over the past
decade as insurance premiums surged in step with medical charges
and as jobs with extensive fringe benefits disappeared in
industries such as manufacturing.
   Hospitals and physicians once shifted the cost of caring for the
uninsured onto those who could pay. But in recent years, both the
government and third-party insurers such as Blue Cross have balked
at shouldering that burden.
   ``The paying patients are driving much harder bargains,'' said
Meyer, president of a research firm called New Directions for
Policy. ``It's much harder to bury these costs in somebody else's
bill.''
   Here is a look at the candidates' positions on uninsured people,
long-term care and AIDS.

<HEAD>THE UNINSURED</HEAD>

   Dukakis, calling it a disgrace that the United States is the
only industrialized country other than South Africa without
universal health insurance, proposes to help 22 million of the
uninsured by backing legislation to order all but the smallest
employers to arrange health insurance.
   Dukakis has also called for a $100 million program to provide
medical and nutritional care to 200,000 pregnant women who lack
insurance or Medicaid coverage.
   ``I want to make sure that quality, affordable health care is
the birthright of every family and citizen in this land,'' says the
Massachusetts governor, whose state last April began requiring
health insurance with most jobs.
   While Dukakis has said this requirement would not cost the
federal Treasury anything, Bush has labeled it a $35 billion tax on
business that could force thousands out of work.
   The vice president says he wants to allow poor people to buy
into the $32 billion Medicaid program, which now covers 24 million
of the needy.
   He has not offered all the specifics, but Bush promises to press
for mandatory Medicaid coverage for all children living in poverty,
starting with infants.
   The Republican would phase in ``affordable coverage for pregnant
women and infants up to 185 percent'' of the poverty line, and
eventually cover older children as well, according to a position
paper.
   Medicaid now covers less than half of all poor children, leaving
11 million unprotected.
   But expanding Medicaid will not be cheap.
   Meyer estimated it would cost $8 billion to $9 billion to cover
all uninsured poor people.

<HEAD>LONG TERM CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With 1.5 million people in nursing homes, typically paying more
than $20,000 a year, long-term care is one of the biggest worries
for older Americans and their families.
   Bush has proposed tax incentives to encourage people to buy
their own long-term-care group insurance and allowing people to
convert their IRAs, savings accounts and life insurance to pay
nursing home bills.
   For those who cannot afford insurance, Bush favors easing
Medicaid requirements so they don't have to spend their life
savings before becoming eligible.
   Dukakis has endorsed Rep. Claude Pepper's $7 billion-a-year plan
to provide first-dollar coverage of long-term care at home.
   Pepper, the Florida Democrat, would pay for this coverage by
levying the 1.45 percent payroll tax for Medicare on all wages
instead of ending it at $45,000, effectively raising the payroll
tax for 8 million workers.
   Dukakis has suggested guaranteeing Medicaid coverage for those
who first exhaust private long-term insurance benefits.

<HEAD>AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush says ``we may have to spend even more'' than the current $1
billion budget for the fight against the deadly virus, but ``money
alone won't stop AIDS.'' He says education is crucial, including
giving students the facts ``in a thoughtful, sensitive manner.''
   Bush supports legislation ``that would make it a crime to
discriminate against AIDS patients and those infected with the
virus.'' He said AIDS test results must be kept ``appropriately
confidential.''
   Dukakis also supports a $1 billion-plus AIDS research and
education budget.
   ``As president, I will educate the public about both the facts
and the myths of this terrible disease,'' he said. Children should
be taught about the disease as part of ``a comprehensive health
education program beginnning in the early grades.''

   A uniformed Czechoslovak border guard

political asylum at a police station, a police spokesman said.
   The 20-year-old Czechoslovak, identified only as Karel K., fled
over the border at Gmuend, 70 miles northwest of Vienna, at 6 a.m.,
said the spokesman from the police station.
   The guard fired shots into the air while still on Czechoslovak

   He said the guard crossed into Austria with the intention of
seeking asylum in the West. He was brought to the main refugee camp
of Traiskirchen outside Vienna.

   It was just two months ago that Michael
Dukakis stood in the Massachusetts Statehouse and scorned
Republican George Bush for having ``some of the highest negatives
ever recorded in American politics.''
   He was referring to the percentage of people who rated the
candidate unfavorably in public opinion polls.
   Two months later, it is Dukakis who has the high negatives.
Polls released this week show the Democratic nominee's unfavorable
rating now tops 40 percent, exceeding that of Bush.
   Republicans say that means Americans don't like what they see as
they learn about Dukakis. In no small way, though, they've learned
about Dukakis through strongly negative television ads and other
attacks by Republicans.
   Dukakis has begun responding with his own negative assaults. On
television commercials and in speeches, he belittles Bush's running
mate Dan Quayle, accuses Bush of plotting a ``raid'' on Social
Security and says the vice president is a failed leader who lacks
good judgment.
   All this is part of what frequently is lamented as the negative
nature of the 1988 presidential race.
   Minor issues or outright distortions are given high-decibel
treatment while hardly a whisper is heard about the national debt,
relations with the Soviets, the AIDS epidemic or the hostages still
held captive in Lebanon.
   Some blame Bush for trivializing the presidential campaign. He
has devoted weeks to attacking Dukakis over the Pledge of
Allegiance, weekend furloughs for prison inmates, membership in the
American Civil Liberties Union and the governor's slowness in
moving to clean up polluted Boston Harbor.
   ``It is true _ it's a very negative campaign, and I say most of
the blame lies with Bush,'' said William Schneider, poliical
observer at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think
tank.
   ``I say his campaign is probably the most disgraceful in modern
American history,'' Schneider says. ``It is also working. It is
both disgraceful and effective.''
   The negative campaign shouldn't come as much of a surprise,
though.
   Look what happened to two bad-luck candidates who talked about
the deficit. Democrat Bruce Babbitt and Republican Robert Dole,
like Walter Mondale four years earlier, discovered to their chagrin
that voters didn't want to hear about unpleasant realities.
   The negative campaign is hardly a 1988 phenomenon.
   ``It is more negative at an earlier stage than any presidential
campaign I've seen,'' said Democratic consultant Frank Greer, who
has been advising Dukakis on the debates. ``The 1980s have seen a
real escalation in the use of negative advertising.''
   Greer says it follows the pattern in Senate and gubernatorial
races. Democrats have become accustomed over the past eight years
to facing intensely negative campaigns centered on a few emotional
issues in state races.
   NCPAC, the National Conservative Political Action Committee, ran
a series of campaigns in which Democratic incumbents were targeted
with intensive negative television commercials on a few emotional
issues. In 1984, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina ran negative TV
ads about his opponent for more than a year.
   The Democrats have learned to deal with such campaigns by
responding forcefully.
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, faced a NCPAC
campaign in Texas in 1982, when he was seeking re-election. He
fired back and won easily.
   On his campaign plane last weekend, Bentsen expressed relief
that Dukakis had finally begun responding with his own hard-hitting
ads.
   ``Where have they been?'' he asked, holding out his arms in an
expression of frustration at the delay.
   Bentsen said the Dukakis campaign should have responded
immediately when, after the Democratic convention in July, the
Republicans began attacks on Dukakis's record and even his
patriotism.
   Bush had some help, too.
   President Reagan's reference to Dukakis as an ``invalid'' was
quickly retracted _ but he succeeded in thrusting onto newspaper
front pages the rumors that Dukakis had hidden mental problems in
the past. The rumors were false, by all evidence. But the episode
coincided with the beginning of Dukakis' summer slide in the polls.
   Some say Dukakis and his advisers are to blame for failing to
anticipate many of the attacks, to recognize the visceral impact
some were having and to respond before lasting damage was done.
   Dukakis, after all, has never run against a serious,
conservative Republican campaign.
   ``One reason why he frittered away 17 points was because he
didn't respond and didn't go hard negative himself,'' said Larry
Sabato, political scientist at the University of Virginia.
   ``You have to fight fire with fire. You can't sit there and take
it. And you can't just occasionally respond and be defensive. You
have to give your response immediately, in tough terms, and then go
on the attack yourself. That's modern politics in a nutshell.''
   The reason campaigns have grown increasingly negative is that
such attacks work. The issues the Bush campaign selected seemed to
resonate with voters as symbols of something larger and unsettling.
   ``Bush attacked Dukakis' values,'' Schneider said.
   He said Dukakis hopes to score similarly with his attacks on
Quayle, hoping it will register as a symbol of Bush's judgment.

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 angry investors demonstrated
Wednesday outside the ruling party headquarters to press the
government to postpone or withdraw its plan to reimpose a stock
profit tax.
   President Lee Teng-hui was chairing a meeting of the
decision-making Central Standing Committee of his Nationalist, or
Kuomintang, party at the time, but officials said the tax issue was
not discussed.
   The protesters carried banners saying ``Hate!'' shouted
``Kuomintang Step Down!'' They threw bottles at riot police when
the truck that had brought them soft drinks was towed away, and
some held up a train for 30 minutes until they were driven off by
the police.
   The nine-hour protest ended peacefully as protesters dispersed.
No injuries were reported, but four protesters who fought police
were arrested.
   Finance Minister Shirley Kuo reiterated Tuesday that the
government will levy the tax next year after a 12-year freeze. The
government says the tax is necessary to cool an overheated market
jammed with speculative funds.
   Under the plan, investors must report in their annual income
returns profits they have made from the sale of more than $103,400
in one year.

<TEXT>
   A fire set by arsonists before
dawn Wednesday severely damaged the headquarters of South Africa's
Roman Catholic Church, a staunch opponent of apartheid.
   No one was injured, but an elderly nun and three other people in
the building in Pretoria were rescued from a balcony where they
were trapped by flames. Three other people, including two bishops,
fled down a fire escape.
   It was the second major attack in six weeks on offices of an
anti-apartheid church organization. The headquarters of the South
African Council of Churches in Johannesburg was wrecked by a bomb
on Aug. 31.
   Police said four emptied containers of gasoline and paraffin
were found in Khanya House, the headquarters of the Southern
African Catholic Bishops Conference. The fire gutted the ground
floor, where the organization's archives and print shop are
located, and caused damage on two upper floors.
   Brother Jude Pieterse, general-secretary of the bishops'
conference, said a parcel containing two unexploded limpet mines
was found in the archives room when employees were allowed to
re-enter the building at midday.
   The bishops' conference said the arsonists ``must have known
that the house was occupied and yet they went ahead, regardless of
the consequences.''
   ``We earnestly pray that the perpetrators of this foul act will
be persued and brought to justice,'' it said.
   The bishops said the attack should be viewed in the context of a
``tragic mess in which our country and its people find themselves''
because of apartheid and racial discrimination.
   Those rescued from the second-floor balcony included three lay
people attending a church meeting in Pretoria and Sister Brigid
Flanagan, about 70, the associate general-secretary of the bishops'
conference.
   ``If it hadn't been for the fast action of the fire department,
we would have all been killed,'' said one of the four, Rob Lambert.
   Police said a minibus with 11 people inside, blacks and whites,
was seen by a policeman outside Khanya House shortly before the
fire broke out about 2 a.m. The vehicle had a false license plate,
police said.
   No arrests have been made in the bombing of Khotso House in
Johannesburg, which housed the offices of the council of churches
and other anti-apartheid organizations.
   Activists have suggested the bombing was carried out by
right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force unit.
   A Catholic lay commission affiliated to the bishops' conference
said the arson attack was ``the work of ruthless right-wing urban
guerrillas who seem to act with impunity.''
   South Africa's Catholic Church is predominantly black.
Conservative white Catholics have complained about the militant
anti-apartheid stance of the bishops' conference.
   Two weeks ago, the bishops distributed a pastoral letter
suggesting that Catholics consider not voting in this month's
nationwide municipal elections. Activists say the elections for
segregated local councils entrench apartheid and bring blacks no
closer to obtaining voting rights on the national level.

<TEXT>
   City Council postponed its monthly
meeting after a third councilman reported that vehicles were
torched at his home and a bomb threat was called in to City Hall,
officials said.
   The burnings began in May, when Mayor Truman Scarborough's 1985
Dodge Aries station wagon was set on fire and destroyed. On Oct. 2,
fire destroyed a 1986 Cutlass Supreme and a 1983 Pontiac 6000 owned
by Vice Mayor Jim Brown.
   Councilman Tom Mariani was the latest victim, with fire
destroying his daughter's 1987 Dodge Shadow and damaging his 1980
Datsun and a small truck he had borrowed to haul campaign signs.
   A bomb threat was reported at City Hall later in the day.
   The two other council members in this city near Cape Canaveral
worry they're next.
   ``I'm not nearly as frightened for myself as I am for my
family,'' said Nathan Brown, who is moving an antique Ford to
another location as a precaution. ``If someone should come to my
residence, I am prepared to do what I have to do. I am not a sheep.
I'll leave it at that.''
   Police patrols will be increased around the homes of all five
council members, said City Manager Randall Reid. Tuesday's council
meeting was rescheduled for next week.
   Police and fire investigators say they have no suspects and no
motive, which could be something as simple as anger over a zoning
decision.
   ``To me, it's really hard to grasp what the motive is,'' Fire
Chief Richard Cherry said. ``Is it because it's an incumbent
council or because they're candidates or what?''
   Mariani was awakened to the blaze in his driveway shortly after
3 a.m. Tuesday by a neighbor's barking dog. On his way outside,
Mariani said, he heard a door slam and a car speed away. With help
from neighbors and passers-by, Mariani kept the flames from
reaching his house until firefighters arrived.
   ``This is crazy. You just don't do things like this,'' said
Mariani, who has been on the City Council off and on for 11 years
and is running for mayor this year. ``I'm just numb. I just can't
believe there are people in our Titusville community who would do
this.''

   Two Miami University seniors decided to pay
fines and court costs rather than fight charges that students
partying at their house chanted the Pledge of Allegiance too loudly.
   Police broke up the Sept. 10 party once, but issued a noise
violation ticket when they returned a second time and were greeted
by students chanting the pledge, tongue in cheek.
   Karen Stevens said she and her roommate, Kimberly Mart, had been
prepared to contest the misdemeanor charges, but decided to end the
case Tuesday rather than drag it out. Judge Mark Conesc found them
guilty and ordered them to pay a combined total of $76 in fines and
court costs.
   The judge asked whether they wanted to contest the manner in
which Oxford's noise ordinance is enforced. He said he could
postpone the case and appoint a lawyer to represent the women, but
they declined the offer.
   The women said they had been careful to ensure that the
``welcome back to school'' party would not disturb neighbors and
had checked with neighbors and police ahead of time.

   A former volunteer firefighter was
arrested and charged in connection with one of the arson fires that
have brought months of fear and sleepless nights to this town,
police said today.
   Plainclothes police officers hustled Lance Lalumiere, 23, into
the police station in neighboring Lancaster this afternoon, and he
was arraigned in district court there later on a single felony
arson charge.
   Since May, 21 fires have been set in the White Mountains town of
850 people _ months marked by anger, sadness, worry and suspicion.
No one has been injured, but there have been some close calls.
   The fire for which Lalumiere was charged occurred Aug. 23 at his
brother's home. It was the 19th in the series of fires.
   Officials declined to comment on whether Lalumiere was a suspect
in any other of the fires. State police scheduled a news conference
for later in the day.
   The charge filed today was based on a state police complaint. At
arraignment in Lancaster District Court, Judge Paul Donovan set
bail at $50,000 cash.
   State police have released few details of their investigation,
which includes members of the state fire marshal's office, the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and help from the
FBI.
   On Tuesday, Lalumiere was taken to a nearby state police
barracks, his brother Michael told the weekly Coos County Democrat.
   After the fire broke out at Michael's home in August, Lance
Lalumiere reported it and was trying to put it out when others
arrived. He was questioned for eight hours and police searched his
home and car, but he was not arrested at the time. In interviews
with the Democrat, he denied involvement in the fires.
   Lance Lalumiere was asked to quit Jefferson's volunteer fire
deparment when he moved to nearby Groveton. He has since moved back
to Jefferson where he works nights as a dishwasher at a restaurant.
   The blazes changed the rhythm of life in Jefferson. Many
families began sleeping in shifts and abandoned vacation and social
plans. Some residents began nighttime patrols to try to catch the
arsonist. Guns were left by the door in many homes.
   As the months passed, the initial shock became tempered by anger
and, for some, resignation. The vigils persist but have in recent
weeks been tinged with the knowledge that this exhausting nocturnal
life cannot continue forever.
   ``I have a feeling we're developing the same callus you develop
in Belfast or Beirut,'' said Charles Bond, a state senator and
Jefferson resident, before today's arrest was announced. ``If a car
bomb is going to blow up in front of your house, it's going to
happen. You're scared, but you have to live with it.''
   The volunteer fire department's 32 current members and 12 other
people have taken polygraph tests. Jefferson has no police force.
   In all of the village's 52 square miles of scenic meadows, woods
and hills, there are only 363 residences and three blocks. Now the
vistas are pockmarked by burned-out shells, some on back roads and
many on main thoroughfares.
   Most of the fires were set late at night, many at the back of
the buildings. They began with brush and fields, then escalated to
barns, empty homes and occupied homes. No one has been killed or
seriously hurt, though some barely escaped with their lives and
some have lost their homes.
   A mother of two, normally softspoken, now bites off her words
with anger. ``I want this person to suffer. I want him caught so he
can hurt a little, like we have,'' said the woman, who like many
residents spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.
   Jefferson's families have prepared for each restless night by
activating lights around their homes that come on automatically
when they sense motion and letting porch lights burn through the
darkness. Some settle in for nightlong vigils of coffee, nerves and
sleeplessness.
   Unmarked patrol cars cruise the village on their way to back
roads. Police routinely stop cars traveling through town at night
and ask for license and registration.
   Tourists flocking to see New Hampshire's famous fall foliage are
surprised to learn this is the town they've seen on national
television and have read about in newspapers.
   Despite the natural beauty, many residents are hoping autumn
will pass quickly and winter snowfall will either make it easier to
track down the arsonist or deter him. But John Harrigan, publisher
of the Democrat, disagrees.
   ``I don't want it to snow and I don't want the fires to stop,''
said Harrigan, whose home was damaged by a fire set in early
August. ``One more fire could mean one more mistake'' by the
arsonist, leading to an arrest.

<HEAD>Military Research Finds AIDS Virus Test Extremely Accurate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of AIDS virus screening among military
recruits found that only one was wrongly identified as infected,
discounting fears that too many people will be mislabeled if there
is widespread testing, a researcher said.
   ``The public should know that if they choose to, they can do
early diagnosis of HIV infection cheaply, they can do it in a
logistically feasible way and they can do it with a great deal of
accuracy,'' said Dr. Robert R. Redfield of the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research in Washington.
   The latest findings, published in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine, were based on the first 20 months of military
screening of all recruits. Just one of the 135,187 people tested
from rural areas was misclassified as infected.
   The test, which reveals the presence of antibodies formed when a
person is exposed to the AIDS virus, is used to screen donated
blood and also offered by public health agencies to check those at
high risk of the disease, such as homosexual men and drug addicts.
   Many of those testing positive for the virus will go on to
develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a crippling of the
body's immune system that leaves a person prey to life-threatening
cancers and infections. There is no cure.
   Experts disagree over whether HIV screening should remain
largely voluntary or whether it should be expanded to include
mandatory testing, in some situations, of people at low risk of
AIDS, such as hospital patients.
   Opponents argue that, among other things, such broad testing
could falsely label many healthy people as infected. For instance,
Dr. Klemens B. Meyer of New England Medical Center has suggested
that of every 10 low-risk people with positive AIDS tests, nine of
them might actually be free of the virus.
   Redfield, who is one of the nation's most persistent advocates
of widespread testing, said the latest findings show this is
untrue. He believes doctors should routinely check for AIDS just as
they do for cancer, heart disease and other illnesses.
   He suggests that AIDS screening be part of routine testing of
hospital patients, pregnant women, marriage license applicants and
clients of venereal disease and drug abuse programs. The aim is to
spot the HIV infection early, when its symptoms can often be
controlled and when carriers can be persuaded not to spread the
disease to others.
   Dr. Harvey Fineberg, dean of the Harvard School of Public
Health, said that while the latest data help build the case for
widespread screening, they are ``not sufficient to shift the
balance altogether.''
   Issues of confidentiality of test results and possible
discrimination against infected people still must be settled, he
said. Promoting condom and spermicide use, fighting drug abuse and
providing clean needles are more economical ways to stop the spread
of AIDS.
   Dr. Robin Weiss of the Institute of Medicine agreed that despite
the test's accuracy, it should remain voluntary, at least for now.
   ``There is no overwhelmingly compelling reason at this moment to
endorse mandatory widespread population screening,'' she said,
``because the answer to the question, `What is the purpose of the
test, and what would you do with the results?' is unclear. There is
no treatment. There is no way to ensure that people will change
their behavior and not spread the disease.''
   Others question whether commercial labs will perform the AIDS
test as accurately as the military.
   Dr. Lawrence Miike of the Congressional Office of Technology
Assessment acknowledged the military's ``phenomenally high accuracy
rate'' but added: ``I'm not worried about them. I'm worried about
labs that advertise, `Come get your HIV test.' I get calls from
people who say they are the victims of false positives.''
   Klemens agreed. ``The question is not how well the best
laboratories can do,'' he said. ``The issue is how well most
laboratories are performing, whether they will maintain this
performance and whether it is good enough.''
   To this, Redfield responded, ``I think it's an unusual time when
the Department of Defense can do things cheaper, quicker and more
accurate than the private sector.''
   Redfield said the military testing has actually improved since
the first 20 months of the program, and mistakenly false results
are now probably only one in 1 million. He said the test costs $3
per person, and the results are ready within three days.
   There have been 74,809 cases of AIDS reported in the United
States since June 1981, according to the Centers for Disease
Control's Oct. 6 statistics, with 42,142 deaths, or 56 percent of
all cases.

   Sobs rose to the choir loft of a small-town
church as caskets were closed at a funeral service Wednesday for
three of the five seventh-grade girls killed when a speeding car
jumped a curb and struck them.
   About 1,000 people, many of them young, filled the Assumption of
Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic Church for the joint funeral for
Laura Karcz and Brenda Hylok, both 13, and Nicole Watia, one month
shy of her 13th birthday.
   Services were scheduled later Wednesday for the other two
victims, Jodi Prokop and Jessica McKeefry, both 13.
   The Rev. Jordan Kuczwara told mourners they could cry and then
go back to their lives, or thank God for the gift of the girls'
short lives and learn something from them.
   ``Thirteen years young, but old enough to achieve something,''
he said, adding that the girls needed no drugs or alcohol but found
happiness in their friends, family and faith.
   ``Remember students, don't cry for them. ... Cry for those who
are looking for other ways to find happiness,'' Kuczwara said.
   Many sobbed as the three caskets were closed.
   The girls were killed Friday night when a Cadillac traveling at
an estimated 70 mph jumped a curb, sheared a utility police and
struck them on a sidewalk along a residential street about two
blocks from the police station.
   Investigators planned to check the car for possible mechanical
problems and to investigate whether the 17-year-old driver, a
diabetic, may have suffered a seizure, said Police Chief Reed
Woodward. No alcohol was involved, he said.
   The driver, who was a distant relative of Laura Karcz, was
listed in critical condition Monday at a Green Bay hospital.
Hospital officials said his parents had asked them not to release
further reports on his condition.
   His 11-year-old sister, who was a passenger in the car, was also
seriously injured.
   At a memorial service for the girls Tuesday night, 2,000 people
who gathered at the Pulaski High School gymnasium heard condolences
from President Reagan and a tape of one of the victims singing rock
star Tiffany's song, ``Could've Been.''
   ``The flowers you gave me are just about to die. When I think of
what could have been, it makes me want to cry,'' sang the
high-pitched young voice of Nicole Watia.
   Mourners hugged and sobbed as the recording was played.

   Under legislation approved Wednesday by
Congress, a commission will recommend by Dec. 31 which of the
nation's military installations should be closed.
   The commission will examine all 3,800 military facilities in the
United States, although it will concentrate on the 550 largest
installations, those which each employ more than 300 civilians.
   No list, either official or unofficial, has been released by the
commission, legislators noted Wednesay. Thus there is no way to yet
know which bases might be closed.
   But critics have long pointed to a trio of bases which they say
represent facilities that could be closed with little harm to the
nation's defense.
   The three are Fort Douglas, Utah, built more than a century ago
to protect stagecoach routes; Fort Monroe, Va., built inside a moat
to defend against the British invasion in the War of 1812; and Fort
Sheridan, Ill., where the major features are a golf course and two
beaches on Lake Michigan.
   Another potential facility to be closed may be Loring Air Force
base in northern Maine, a Strategic Air Command base which the Air
Force proposed closing in 1975. It was that proposal which prompted
Congress to erect stiff hurdles against base closings.
   In 1985, the Pentagon prepared a list of bases which it said
could be closed. That list will likely be reviewed by the
commission.
   The 1985 list included Fort Devens, Mass.; Cameron Station, Va.;
Fort Wingate Depot, N.M.; Blytheville Air Force Base, Ark.; the
refueling wing at McConnell Air Force Base, Kan.; the Philadelphia
Naval Shipyard; Naval Regional Medical Center, Oakland, Calif.; New
Cumberland Army Depot, Pa.; and Letterkenny Army Depot, Pa.

<HEAD>Hotline To Help With Care Of Latchkey Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A year-old program to promote the safety of
so-called latchkey children who are home alone while their parents
work is being expanded to include a tollfree hotline to a national
resource center, organizers said Wednesday.
   Parents and other adults seeking information about the care of
school-age children can call a hotline for ``Project Home Safe,'' a
national program developed by the American Home Economics
Association and financed by the Whirlpool Foundation.
   The three-year project began a year ago and provides research,
training, materials and standards on how to improve the care of
school-age youth. The term ``latchkey children'' dates back to the
19th century when working-class children who were on their own wore
their house keys on neck chains.
   Gladys Gary Vaughn, the association's research unit
administrator, said at a news conference that today's latchkey
children number an estimated 6.5 million and cross racial, ethnic,
economic and geographic lines.
   She was joined by Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who said few
families can attain the ``American dream'' of children, college,
home ownership, cars and health insurance on just one income
anymore.
   ``We have to deal with reality, not with nostaligia,'' she said.
   During its first year, Project Home Safe trained health care
professionals who will work with home economists, parents, teachers
and children in Washington, D.C.; Detroit; Columbus, Ohio; Little
Rock, Ark; and Long Beach, Calif. Training sites in the second year
will include Denver; Orlando, Fla.; Danville, Ky.; Portland, Ore.;
College Sation, Texas, and Milwaukee.
   The tollfree number to reach the Washington resource center is
1-800-252-SAFE. It is not designed for children.

<TEXT>
   The four Panamanian members of the commission
that operates the Panama Canal boycotted the quarterly meeting
Wednesday in protest of U.S. policies toward the military leader
Manuel Noriega's rule.
   It was the second time since January the four have refused to
attend, but the five U.S. members were able to conduct business.
   ``It does deprive the commission of the input of the Panamanian
members with regard to Panamanian interests,'' commission Chairman
William Gianelli said.
   At Wednesday's daylong, closed session, he said, members
discussed the commission's $500 million budget and details of
moving dependents of some 1,100 canal commission employees back
home to the United States should they decide to voluntarily leave
during the current tensions between the U.S. and Panama.
   The commission was formed as a result of the 1977 treaty in
which the United States agreed to turn over ownership of the canal
to Panama by the year 2000.
   The Panamanians' boycott followed the indictment of Noriega on
U.S. drug charges, pressure from the Reagan administration for
Noriega to step down, imposition of economic sanctions against
Panama, refusal by the United States to recognize Noriega's chosen
president and this country's continued recognition of ousted
Panamanian President Del Valle.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slovenia, the nation's most liberal
republic, accused Serbia again Wednesday of fanning ethnic turmoil
that has combined with economic chaos to create a political crisis.
   The attack by Slovenia's Communist Party leader, Milan Kucan, on
nationalist rallies by Serbs came the day after Serbian party
leader Slobodan Milosevic made a strong defense of the mass
demonstrators, at which supporters often shout his name.
   Kucan told the Slovene party's Central Committee:
   ``It is not hard to kindle fires of political, nationalist,
social and other passions, but one should also think about what
remains after the fire. Burned-out structures take time to be
covered with oblivion.
   ``It is the final hour for sobering up, for halting insanity
which is driving us to destruction, and the last moment to stop
those who are using and manipulating people's misfortunes.''
   Weeks of strikes, public protest and ethnic unrest have plagued
Yugoslavia, which has not had strong leadership since President
Tito died in 1980.
   Inflation running at an annual rate of 217 percent, the foreign
debt is $21 billion and 15 percent of Yugoslav workers are
unemployed. Austerity measures imposed in May have cut real wages
while prices continue to rise.
   The split in the Slavic camp between Serbs and Slovenes is part
of political maneuvering before a meeting of the national party's
Central Committee Oct. 17, which is expected to produce a showdown
and leadership changes.
   Stipe Suvar, chief of the national party, promised a major
shakeup after protesting throngs demanded the resignation of
leaders blamed by workers and farmers for the worst economic crisis
since World War II.
   There is broad consensus that radical economic reform is needed
but the ethnic unrest, which developed into anti-government
demonstrations last weekend, has split the leaderships of the
national and regional parties.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure. Serbia
is the largest republic and both provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina,
are part of its territory.
   Tito specified the decentralized system of government and
collective federal presidency in his 1974 constitution to prevent
one republic from gaining sway over the others, but the result has
been ineffective government by compromise.
   Kucan urged national party members Wednesday to avoid a
wholesale purge, which he said would not solve the nation's
problems.
   He said mass protests Oct. 6-7 brought Yugoslavia ``to the
threshhold'' of ``an extraordinary situation'' in which some
elements in Yugoslavia, left unidentified, would have welcomed
military intervention.
   ``Do the proponents of these demands indeed fail to see that
they only support the suspesion of the legal, legitimate system?''
he asked.
   In a direct attack on the Serbian leadership, which on Monday
attacked the Slovenian party's weekend statement criticizing
Serbia, Kucan denounced ``the vehemence, aggression and the
unsubstantiated nature of the reaction of the comrades from
Serbia.''
   A meeting between members of the national party's ruling
Politburo and the Communist leadership of ethnically troubled
Kosovo province ended early Wednesday with no resolution of Serbian
demands for the dismissal of three senior Kosovo party figures.
   Serbia's Central Committee made the demand Tuesday in the
meeting in which Milosevic defended mass rallies of Serbs.
   Slavic residents of Kosovo, a southern province adjacent to
Albania, claim they are victimized by ethnic Albanians, who make up
90 percent of Kosovo's population.

   Emperor Hirohito, who has been bedridden with
intestinal hemorrhaging for three weeks, has grown weaker as his
anemia and jaundice worsen, Imperial Palace officials and news
reports said Wednesday.
   Doctors gave the 87-year-old emperor more blood in an attempt to
reduce the anemia, said Kenji Maeda, a spokesman for the Imperial
Household Agency.
   Officials said Hirohito's strength was declining because doctors
were unable to supply enough nutrients through intravenous feeding.
   The emperor, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has not been
able to eat anything except for two ice cubes and a few spoonfuls
of porridge since his condition worsened Sept. 19.
   Although the emperor did not discharge any blood Wednesday, a
Palace official said Wednesday he could not rule out the
possibility of internal bleeding from his intestine.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports
that Hirohito has cancer in his upper digestive system, and they
have urged the media to refrain from such speculation.
   China announced that Foreign Minister Qian Qichen has postponed
a planned trip to Japan because of the emperor's illness. Qian was
to visit Oct. 20-25 to mark the 10th anniversary of a peace and
friendship treaty between the two countries.
   Hirohito has no political power but serves as a symbol of the
unity of Japan. Until Hirohito renounced his divinity after World
War II, emperors were considered living gods.
   Since Hirohito's condition worsened, about 4 million Japanese
have signed registers around the country to express their hopes for
his recovery.
   However, the emperor's status has remained controversial since
the war, when his name was used to rally support for Japan.

   The hunt crossed three continents and required
hundreds of computers, but a team of researchers captured a prize
few thought possible _ the prime factors of the 100-digit number on
mathematicians' ``most wanted'' list.
   The breakthrough could have important implications for
governments and banks, which use large-digit numbers in security
systems on the assumption they provide a code too difficult to
break.
   But the pleasure of the hunt concerned researchers more.
   ``Why did we go after it?'' University of Chicago computer
scientist Arjen Lenstra said Wednesday. ``Because people compile
lists.''
   The number, which begins 9,412,343,607 ... and stretches on for
90 more digits, defied all previous efforts to find its prime
factors.
   The factors of a number are two numbers that, when multiplied
together, yield the larger number. A prime number is one that is
evenly divisible only by 1 or itself.
   The prime factors of 21, for example, are 3 and 7. By
comparison, the prime numbers that solved the 100-digit number are,
respectively, 41 digits and 60 digits long.
   Finding the prime factors of such large numbers was thought to
be so difficult, in fact, that many security systems assume such
computations to be beyond the range of even the most powerful
computers being applied for long periods of time.
   Governments transfer secret messages and banks transfer funds
electronically by encoding the information in large-digit numbers
that require the receiver to know its prime factors in order to
decipher the information.
   ``Ten years ago, everybody suggested 80 digits were safe.
Nowadays, that's trivial'' said Lenstra, co-director of the project
with Dr. Mark Manasse of the Digital Equipment Corp.'s Systems
Research Center in Palo Alto, Calif.
   ``I think 150 is reasonable,'' he continued. ``But personally,
I'd go a little beyond 200 now.''
   Computer scientists had theorized that a single computer doing a
million calculations per second would have needed 25 years to solve
the problem. Even a state-of-the-art supercomputer such as the Cray
would need about 10 months of constant computing _ that at a cost
of thousands of dollars per hour.
   Lenstra and Manasse, however, factored the number in just 26
days.
   They began their attack on the 100-digit number by breaking the
problem into smaller tasks, then farmed them out to about 400
computers in the United States, Europe and Australia through an
exisiting electronic mail network.
   All the computers used in the project worked on the factoring
problem only when they were not being used for anything else. Each
time a problem was solved, it was relayed by electronic mail to
Digital's Palo Alto lab.
   The last sequence of numbers required to solve the entire
problem flashed across a computer screen at 2:03 a.m. PDT Tuesday.
   ``One of the really nice things about this effort is that it
cost us virtually nothing,'' Lenstra said. ``We contacted friends,
other computer scientists, anybody that thought factoring was fun
and got them to participate.''
   Lenstra, 32, a visiting professor in Chicago's computer science
department is unsure where the next horizon lies. He said every
time the length of the number goes up by three digits, the time
needed to compute the prime factors doubles.
   ``But we don't know what our problem-solving limit is until we
find out how much interest is out there and how big an electronic
mail network we can assemble.
   ``We've already started on a 102-digit number,'' he concluded,
``just to keep us busy.''

<TEXT>
   The future of the biennial ``Race Against Time,''
which raised millions of dollars for the world's poor, hung in the
balance Wednesday when its sponsor went into voluntary liquidation.
   Sport for Sport Aid Ltd., which organized the series of six-mile
road runs in 128 countries, relied on sales of T-shirts, entry fees
and television videos to pay for administrative costs.
   Sport Aid blamed its collapse on an August mail strike in
Britain that hampered the distribution of sponsorship forms. Only
215,000 Britons, one-third the expected turnout, took part in the
Sept. 11 event.
   The charity backed by the company, Sport Aid Foundation, ``is
unaffected and is still receiving money,'' said company spokesman
Nick Cater.
   The company owes creditors $3.9 million, Cater said.
   The accounting firm Deloitte, Haskins and Sells has been
appointed to clear the company's debts. Money raised by people who
took part in the Race Against Time won't be used to pay off
creditors, said a spokeswoman who requested anonymity.
   ``The question of whether we will be back and do it all again
depends on the people on the ground and those who took part,'' he
said. ``They put heart and soul into the event. They will decide
what is to happen.''
   The first Sport Aid race, on May 25, 1986, attracted nearly 20
million runners in 89 countries and raised more than $35 million
for African famine victims.
   The amount raised by Sport Aid '88 will not be known until the
end of the year, Cater said. A third race had been planned for 1990.

   The outlawed Irish Republican
Army claimed responsbility Wednesday for a shooting in a Belfast
ice cream parlor in which an off-duty policeman was killed and two
customers were injured.
   The IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, made the claim in a statement to Belfast news media.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force,
would not release the names of the slain policeman or the injured
man and woman.
   But a spokesman said police were trying to trace the dead man's
brother, the ice cream parlor owner, who was on holiday in Spain.
The policeman was filling in for his brother when he was shot in
the chest Tuesday.
   The ice cream parlor is off a main traffic route in south
Belfast where sectarian differences are less pronounced than in
other areas of the city.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Wednesday it will permit the use of cancer-causing pesticides whose
residues on foods are increased during processing if the risk of
cancer is negligible.
   The agency so far has interpreted the so-called ``Delaney
clause'' barring cancer-causing food additives as requiring it to
refuse new pesticide licenses for such chemicals.
   The reversal of policy is in line with one of the
recommendations of a National Academy of Sciences panel last year.
   Jack Moore, EPA's deputy administrator, said the change clears
the way for decisions on 73 old pesticides, licensed when standards
were looser, for which there is some evidence of cancer-causing
power. It also may permit the licensing of weakly carcinogenic new
chemicals which might be safer than current compounds.
   At least a dozen chemicals are known to be in the second group,
but not all have current license applications pending.
   ``If you don't let (the new chemical) on the market there'll
never be an opportunity'' to retire the old one, either through
regulations or competitive pressure, Moore said.
   Asked if he was arguing that the new policy would mean safer
food, he replied: ``Yes. That's not a conclusion the agency came to
by itself; it's also the conclusion of the academy report.''
   EPA's new policy defines as ``negligible risk'' a maximum
one-in-a-million chance of getting cancer from the residue in
question over a lifetime.
   Environmentalists denounced the action. ``We are horrified,''
said Janet Hathaway of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``It
amounts to rewriting the Delaney clause and completely gutting the
Delaney clause.''
   Jay Feldman, coordinator of the National Campaign Against the
Misuse of Pesticides, said a one-in-a-million standard might be
acceptable in principle, but not for a single pesticide considered
apart from all the others.
   ``The agency has no proposal to curtail additive risk. ... we're
talking about significant exposure'' when all chemicals are
considered, he said.
   The ``Delaney clause,'' named for its 1958 sponsor, then-Rep.
James J. Delaney, D-N.Y., is in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act. It bars the use of any food additive shown to cause cancer in
``man or animal.'' The act classifies as additives those pesticides
whose residue is concentrated during processing.
   The same act requires EPA to set maximum permissible
concentrations for pesticide residues on both raw and processed
food, and no pesticide leaving a residue may be used if such a
tolerance has not been established.
   The Delaney clause does not apply to raw foods, and under the
separate pesticide law EPA can permit the use of pesticides that
cause cancer if the benefits outweigh the risk.
   The Food and Drug Administration was rebuffed in court in trying
to use a similar one-in-a-million ``negligible risk'' standard for
food coloring under the Delaney clause, but Moore said the court
``went out of its way to point out that the language of the
Cosmetic Act ... may not apply directly to food additives
associated with pesticide use.''
   The old chemicals of which Moore spoke, about 50 of which are
known to concentrate during processing, have been in a regulatory
limbo for several years.
   These and many other chemicals were licensed when standards were
much looser. EPA since the late 1970s has been gathering data from
laboratory animal and other tests to re-license all 656 chemicals
used as active ingredients in pesticides. About 300 are used on
foods.
   New data for the 73 chemicals showed ``if we were to apply a
rigid Delaney approach those old pesticides would have to come off
the market,'' Moore said.
   A ``zero risk (policy) is totally infeasible as we sit here
today. There would be so many pesticide uses being curtailed we'd
cause dramatic and deep disruption in the food supply,'' Moore said.
   Both Ms. Hathaway and Feldman said EPA has been obliged all
along to use the Delaney clause against old pesticides when new
data become available, regardless of whether the clause bars
licensing of certain new chemicals.

<HEAD>Coalition Including Farm Groups Joins Pesticide Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer, environmental and farm groups
launched Wednesday a drive for further tightening of curbs on the
use of chemical pesticides on the nation's crops.
   ``We are drenching our food and drowning the nation in an
ever-increasing amount of agricultural chemicals,'' declared John
O'Connor, director of the newly launched National Toxics Campaign.
   The coalition was billed at a news conference as a switch from
past campaigns to curb pesticides in which environmentalists and
farmers have found themselves at odds.
   American Agriculture Movement and the National Farmers Union
officials on hand praised the coalition's stress on restricting the
supply of farm crops _ and thus raising farm prices _ as a prelude
to scaling back pesticide use.
   Absent were the National Farm Bureau and other groups that
traditionally represent a broad sweep of agribusiness as well as
politically influential producer groups, such as the corn, wheat
and soybean growers associations. Many farmers remain opposed to
additional pesticide curbs and chilly toward environmentalists.
   Environmentalists have been campaigning for 26 years for
tightened controls over pesticides, citing evidence that more than
50 basic ingredients in chemicals sprayed on U.S. crops cause
cancer in laboratory animals as well as an array of other health
problems.
   Congress last month approved legislation that would set a
nine-year deadline for completion of safety testing by the
Environmental Protection Agency of more than 600 active ingredients
in pesticides. At the current pace, the job would take until the
year 2024, congressional investigators estimate.
   Even sponsors of the legislation, however, have been painting it
as a bare-bones measure that represented merely the best compromise
that could be reached for the time being. They have been urging
action next year to combat increasing pesticide contamination of
groundwater _ the basic drinking supply for an estimated 113
million Americans.
   At its news conference, the National Toxics Campaign issued a
35-page report detailing the pesticide problem. It mainly
represented a recycling of data that have appeared in previous
documents examining the issue.
   It called for both control of the supply of agricultural
commodities and a program of ``integrated pest management,'' as
well as new pesticide curbs.
   Supply management, opposed by many farm groups, would go into
effect under legislation sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and
Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. Its aim is to prevent enormous
surpluses that drive down farm prices.
   A few groups, such as the National Save the Family Farm
Coalition, have long been campaigning for such a measure, which was
nevertheless shelved early in the current session of Congress. They
say better farm prices would offset production losses as a result
of reduced reliance on pesticides.
   ``Family farmers are ready to reduce their use of expensive and
dangerous chemicals _ but federal policies stand in our way,''
Susan Denser of the Family Farm coalition told the news conference.
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, also on hand for the news
conference, said keeping families on the farm was an important goal
to avoid ``oligarchy domination of agribusiness plantations.''
   Integrated pest managment, another goal of the coalition, stands
for a variety of techniques such as reduced pesticide use, tilling
in a manner that protects crops from pests and scouting farm fields
to avoid needless spraying.
   Federal monitoring of pesticides in groundwater and an array of
other measures left out of this year's pesticide bill also are
being advocated by the coalition as part of a farm bill that may be
written next year.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group said
congressional candidates received more than $4 million in campaign
contributions from pesticide manufacturers over the last five years.
   The contributions were made by political action committees
operated by 21 member companies of the National Agricultural
Chemicals Association, which represents pesticide manufacturers,
the Capitol Hill-based group said. It noted the chemical companies'
opposition to groundwater provisions supported by most
environmentalists.
   ``There is a strong correlation between chemical company ...
contributions to a politician and that politician's vote on
regulatiion of the chemical industry,'' said Rick Hind of the
research group.
   He said the chemical companies were ``applying agricultural
techniques to Capitol Hill _ they sow campaign contributions and
reap legislation that allows them to operate with minimal
government oversight.''

   Soldiers blew up four Palestinian homes and
sealed five others Wednesday in reprisal for the murder of Arabs
who collaborated with Israel. Palestinians hurled a grenade at a
troop bus but missed.
   Noting an increased use of guns and grenades by Palestinian
activists, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin suggested there had been
a shift in Palestinian tactics from stones to more sophisticated
weapons.
   ``Once they shift from civilian violence to terror for me it is
proof that they failed to achieve their goals by what they call the
intefadeh,'' Rabin said, using the Arabic word for uprising.
   But clashes continued in the occupied territories. Israel radio
reported seven Palestinians wounded, four in the West Bank and
three in the Gaza Strip.
   In the Gaza Strip, sources said a grenade was thrown between a
bus carrying soldiers and a civilian car. The army said no injuries
resulted, and soldiers sealed the area and detained a number of
Palestinians.
   A day earlier, a grenade was thrown at an army jeep, wounding
two soldiers in the legs.
   Rabin, speaking to a Foreign Press Association luncheon, noted
Wednesday's incident was the third time grenades had been hurled in
the recent days and that a village leader had been shot to death
with an assault rifle by PLO enforcers.
   He said terror attacks had declined in the occupied lands in the
past 10 months as Palestinian activists focused on large-scale
demonstrations and stone-throwing confrontations.
   But the defense minister said the army had succeeded in stopping
big protests and in recent days there had been a upsurge in the use
of bullets, bombs and grenades.
   ``It represents a failure by them to create a number of violent
incidents by simple means, and therefore a beginning by this small
group to return to terror as it was used in the past,'' Rabin said.
   The army did not identify the group behind the latest grenade
attacks, but Arab journalists in the Gaza Strip said rumors
circulated that the attacks were the work of Islamic militants.
   Palestinian sources said Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization was not involved, and prominent Palestinians said they
were not aware of any change in PLO policy.
   PLO leaders have said Palestinian protesters had access to
weapons but had been instructed not to use them in confrontations
with Israelis.
   The restraint has won Palestinians international sympathy, and
the embargo on terror is an essential ingredient for any
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue after Israel's Nov. 1 general election.
   Rabin said he believed the use of bullets by Palestinians may be
an effort to prod PLO leaders into taking a stand politically on
negotiations with Israel.
   But many of the recent casualties have coincided with stepped-up
arrest raids and the introduction of plastic bullets.
   Since the beginning of the month, 15 Palesitinans have been
killed and scores wounded, raising the overall death toll to 295
since the uprising began Dec. 8.
   Ten suspected Arab collabators with Israeli authorities have
been killed since last December, including three who were stabbed
to death in recent weeks in Nablus, about 30 miles north of
Jerusalem.
   Soldiers blew up four houses in Nablus and sealed five others.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, military commander of the West Bank,
said the houses belonged to Palestinian members of a group
responsible for killing the Arabs who cooperated with Israel.
   The United States has asked Israel to stop the policy of blowing
up houses because it is done without court hearings.
   A pool of Israeli reporters witnessed the house-blowing
operation Wednesday, but foreign reporters and photographers were
banned.
   Roni Shaked, a reporter for the daily Yediot Ahronot, saw the
explosions and said the early morning reaction prompted immediate
protests.
   ``Immediately after the blast, before the column of smoke rose
up to the sky, terrible shouts came from all the windows and
doorways of the neighborhood,'' he said.
   The reporter said there were calls of ``Allahu Akbar!'' _ Arabic
for ``God is great!''
   ``It was a call for battle, for revenge ... for many long
minutes this call hung in the air along with many whistles,'' he
said.
   The city of 120,000 has been under curfew since violent riots
erupted Friday after rumors circulated that Israeli troops had
opened fire on a mosque, killing four Palestinians, and killed
another Palestinian who had his arms bound behind his back.
   The army denied soldiers shot into a mosque and the Jerusalem
Post quoted the army as saying soldiers had handcuffed a prisoner,
not realizing in the dark that he had been wounded. He later died.

   Ursula Nordstrom, an award-winning
editor of children's books who handled the works of E.B. White,
Maurice Sendak and Laura Ingalls Wilder, has died. She was 78.
   Nordstrom, formerly publisher and editor in chief of juvenile
books at Harper & Row, died Tuesday at New Milford Hospital of
ovarian cancer, hospital officials said. She lived in Bridgewater.
   In 1945, Nordstorm edited White's first children's book,
``Stuart Little.'' Seven years later, White presented her with his
only copy of what became his classic ``Charlotte's Web.''
   ``I was overwhelmed,'' she wrote in a 1974 article in The New
York Times. ``I didn't dare take a chance on losing the manuscript
on the train home, or whatever, so I sat down and began to read.''
   She also published Sendak's ``Where the Wild Things Are,''
filled with the aggressive beasts of children's fantasies, after
other publishing houses had rejected it.
   ``With her incomparable editorial genius, Ursula Nordstrom
transformed the American children's book into a genuine art form,''
Sendak said Tuesday.
   ``I was there, one of her eager apprentices, profiting immensely
from her intuition and her generous heart. She was the best of
mommas, the best of teachers, the best of friends.''
   Her other authors included Wilder, who wrote the
autobiographical ``Little House on the Prairie'' series.
   Nordstrom went to work at Harper & Row in 1936. She became head
of the children's book department in 1940 and in 1960 became the
publishing company's first female vice president.
   Her books have won numerous awards, including three Newbury
Medals and two Caldecott Medals, the most prestigious children's
book awards.
   Nordstrom had no survivors.
   There was no funeral for Nordstrom, whose remains were cremated,
said a spokesman for the Lillis Funeral Home in New Milford.

   Vice President George Bush engaged in some
light preparation on Wednesday for a second nationally televised
presidential debate he said would show Americans ``what my
heartbeat is, what I really care about.''
   Bush sandwiched several hours of debate preparation in between a
morning jog and a baseball playoff game at night.
   The Republican presidential nomineee expressed confidence about
Thursday's second nationally televised debate with rival Michael
Dukakis and told reporters: ``We do seem to be looking a little
stronger politically these days.''
   Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate said the vice president planned
only several hours of debate preparation with aides Wednesday and
would not have any further mock debates. The last such sessions
occurred Tuesday morning and last Saturday in Washington with
sparring partner Richard Darman, a former deputy treasury secretary.
   Bush planned to take off the rest of the day to attend the
seventh and deciding game at Dodger Stadium in the National League
Championship series between Los Angeles and the New York Mets.
   Asked by reporters what he hoped to accomplish in the second
debate, Bush said: ``What I want to is have them (Americans)
understand what my heartbeat is, what I really care about.''
   He said those areas included ``foreign affairs, the defense of
this country, world peace, how I as president would build on that.''
   Bush added that he planned to cite fewer statistics in the
debate and talk more on ``how I would like to lead this country,
where I'd like to see us be in the nineties if I'm elected
president.''
   ``So I want to spell it out on that broader sense this time, and
let the others nitpick on all these other little numbers and
statistics,'' he said.
   He denied anew that he had been engaging in negative campaigning
against Dukakis, saying: ``What I have to do is make him be what he
is, and that he seems reluctant to do, and then I've got to be what
I am. And that second part is what I really want to concentrate on
at this debate.
   ``He can't run away from his past, he can't say today that he's
mainstream when he's been on the left-hand spectrum of the American
political process.''
   The vice president also jogged for about 20 minutes in a
municipal park with about a dozen students from the University of
California, Los Angeles, who all wore Bush-Quayle T-shirts.
   In a briefing for reporters, Ms. Tate said that Bush wasn't
worried about the possibility of a surprise blow from Dukakis.
``He's pretty good at dodging and weaving,'' she said. ``I don't
think we'll worry too much about unexpected blows.''
   She also said she doubted Bush would rely heavily on one-liners
in this debate. ``It ought not to be reduced to some kind of
show-business sting of one-liners,'' she said. ``And if it is, the
voters won't get as much out of it.
   ``Weeks of stories about handlers and crafting one-liners and
strategic responses takes a toll. I think they lose some
credibility.''
   Comparing this debate with the last one, she said, ``we rate
them pretty much the same.''
   And, she warned, don't expect to see a different Bush this time
around.
   ``What you see pretty much is what you get,'' she said. ``You're
not going to see an entirely different type of debate from his
standpoint.''

<HEAD>Sihanouk Says Khmer Rouge ``Moderates'' Are Acceptable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Cambodian head of state Prince Norodom
Sihanouk said Wednesday after meeting with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz that moderate elements of the Khmer Rouge should
be included in a new coalition government in Cambodia once
Vietnamese troops withdraw.
   While restating his view that Khmer Rouge leaders who were
responsible for ``genocide'' against the Cambodian people a decade
ago must be excluded, Sihanouk said moderate elements could be
included in a new ``collegial system.''
   ``Then we could control them,'' Sihanouk told reporters at the
State Department, adding that to exclude all elements of the Khmer
Rouge would ``make them bandits.''
   The Khmer Rouge, which is believed to have killed between 1
million and 2 million Cambodians during their 1975-78 rule, is one
of three factions fighting the Vietnamese-backed government in
Phnom Penh.
   Based on his talks here, which included a meeting Tuesday with
President Reagan, Sihanouk said his view of the situation in
Cambodia and that of the United States are ``practically the same.''
   Shultz reaffirmed the longstanding U.S. position that elements
of an acceptable settlement include a complete withdrawal of
Vietnamese forces and the emergence of a coalition government ``not
dominated by any faction.''
   ``We simply cannot see a return to power of the Khmer Rouge,''
Shultz said.
   Sihanouk, who was deposed in a 1970 military coup, reaffirmed
his view that leaders of the Khmer Rouge should be exiled, perhaps
in China.
   ``But they must not participate in the new government. Only the
ones who are the moderates who are not responsible for the genocide
should be accepted,'' he said.
   The Reagan administration is providing $5 million in non-lethal
assistance to the two anti-communist rebel groups and is consulting
with members of Congress about the possibility of an increase.
Vietnam has set a 1990 deadline for completing a withdrawal of its
troops.
   The Khmer Rouge is said to be the strongest of the three
factions fighting the pro-Vietnamese government and a major
international effort is under way to ensure that that group does
not play a dominant role in Cambodia's future political evolution.
   Particularly active in this effort have been the six members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations _ Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Brunei.
   One of the measures being discussed to limit the Khmer Rouge
role is the establishment of an international peacekeeping force.
Other measures under discussion include the disarming of all
Cambodian factions and removing leading Khmer Rouge figures from
Cambodia.

   Friends of Ruth Dowdell predicted she would
``scream and squeal'' when she returned home from vacation and
found her newly refurbished house.
   They were right.
   ``Oh man, this is neat!'' Mrs. Dowdell yelled Tuesday as she
walked through her home in northeast Oklahoma City. The cabinets
were neat. The dishwasher was neat, the curtains were neat, the
carpet was neat.
   ``This is God's doing,'' she hollered. ``God is neat, buddy.''
   And so, it seems, are many of Mrs. Dowdell's fellow Faith
Tabernacle church members. When she left town on vacation last
month, the congregation moved in to fix her dilapidated house.
   When Mrs. Dowdell, 63, left to visit relatives, the house had a
leaky roof, holes in the walls, gaps in the plumbing and hazards in
the wiring. When she returned, her house smelled of fresh paint and
hummed with new appliances.
   The church traditionally does such projects in other states and
in Mexico, said mission team leader Caroline Callahan. This time,
the church decided to do its work closer to home, for one of their
own, favorite members.
   Her friends first put on a new roof and installed new sheetrock.
Then a carpenter decided he could repair the windows, and a mason
took a look at the brick, and someone brought by a new water heater.
   D.A. Counce, who supervised the project, estimates the donations
included between 3,000 and 4,000 working hours and cash
contributions of $1,100. Counce figured the job, if contracted out,
would have cost $30,000.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With time running out on the 100th Congress, a
House dispute over non-tax amendments delayed negotiations
Wednesday on a compromise package of tax cuts and increases.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said he doubts the bill can become law this year
unless negotiators complete their work on Friday.
   But squabbling over some Senate amendments delayed even the
appointment of the House negotiators, who would be led by
Rostenkowski. The delay forced cancellation of a scheduled
negotiating session Wednesday.
   At issue are amendments protecting the Manassas Battlefield in
Virginia against some commercial development, and proposed
sanctions against Iraq for using poison gas against some minority
citizens.
   The Manassas amendment is under jurisdiction of the House
Interior Committee; the Iraq amendment falls under the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. Those committees could be expected to
demand representation among the House negotiators, which
Rostenkowski opposes.
   Wilson Morris, a spokesman for House Speaker Jim Wright, said he
expected the problem to be worked out, possibly in time for
negotiators to begin work Thursday.
   The House and Senate bills are designed primarily to correct
errors in the 1986 tax overhaul. They also include dozens of other
amendments that cut some taxes and raise others. The Senate bill
would raise about $3 billion over three years; the House version,
between $7.1 billion and $7.5 billion.

   The FBI has closed its monthlong
investigation into allegations of a 1978 baby swap at a rural
hospital after finding no evidence that federal laws were broken,
an agency spokesman said.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg, a Langhorne, Pa., couple who sought the
inquiry, can ask state officials to investigate whether violations
of law occurred, FBI spokesman Russ Wood said Tuesday.
   The Twiggs claim their newborn was stolen at Hardee Memorial
Hospital in Wauchula nearly 10 years ago. Mrs. Twigg maintains her
healthy baby girl was switched for a sickly child and that records
were altered to hide the swap.
   Genetic blood tests this summer showed that the child they
raised for nearly 10 years, Arlena, was not their real daughter,
the Twiggs said. Arlena suffered from a heart defect and died
following surgery Aug. 23.
   The Twiggs filed a $100 million suit against the hospital and
some employees two weeks later.
   Wood declined to give details of the FBI investigation.
   But records show that during its probe the FBI interviewed the
Twiggs, subpoenaed documents from the hospital, and talked with the
father of a Sarasota girl who the Twiggs think may be their
daughter. The couple claim she was the only other white girl born
at Hardee Memorial at the same time.
   The Sarasota girl has not been identified to protect her from
publicity.

   Michael Dukakis on Wednesday declared
Democrats the winners in the two debates thus far in the
presidential campaign and promised to ``make it a clean sweep''
with a win in his final showdown with Republican George Bush.
   Dukakis interrupted his preparations for the debate to toss a
baseball around with an aide and, sticking to sports metaphors,
described the pitches he planned throw at Bush during their
nationally televised debate starting at 9 p.m. EDT Thursday at the
Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus.
   ``A fastball, curve, slider _ maybe a knuckler,'' was the
Democratic nominee's description of his planned debate repertoire.
``We're ahead 2-0, we're going to make it a clean sweep.''
   Dukakis, sporting a UCLA sweatshirt, reacted firmly to a
question as to whether he thought it possible he would win the
popular vote but lose to Bush in the Electoral College count, which
decides the election.
   ``We're going to win, period,'' Dukakis said.
   Various polls have suggested that Dukakis is close to Bush in
the overall race but that Bush is further ahead in potential
electoral votes.
   Asked how Bush should handle any debate questions about running
mate Dan Quayle, Dukakis, who has been highly critical of the
Indiana senator, answered in a single word, ``Gingerly.''
   Dukakis shook hands with several people eating their lunch on
the pool deck of his Los Angeles hotel before returning to daylong
meetings with aides and advisers who traveled to the debate city
with him Tuesday night.
   Quayle is likely to be a prime debate target for Dukakis, who
aides say also will try to portray Bush as an insensitive and
failed leader who has offered no realistic solutions to the major
problems facing average Americans.
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis strategists from the California and
national campaigns assessed the campaign so far and what Dukakis
still must do.
   ``I hope we don't look at presidential elections as personality
contests,'' said Ron Brown, a former Jesse Jackson aide who now
advises Dukakis.
   ``We hope the American public will judge Michael Dukakis on what
he says and not on how he looks,'' Brown said. ``We think that the
American people, the more they see of Michael Dukakis, the more
thay are going to be persuaded by his view of the future.''
   As for California, Dukakis' state campaign manager, Tony
Podesta, said the Democratic ticket held a small lead in this
crucial state and hoped to expand on it through televisions ads
that counter what Podesta called ``some of the slime and lies the
Bush camp has been putting forth'' about the Dukakis record on
crime and the environment.
   Brown disputed Republican assertions that Bush has wrapped up
most of the South, West and Rocky Mountain states, but he added
that while Dukakis publicly speaks of a 50-state campaign,
targeting decisions will be made in the next few days.
   ``Obviously we are focusing on the areas where we think we've
got to win,'' Brown said. ``I think you see a scenario, a very
reasonable scenario, that indicates this thing is nowhere near
over.''
   Added Podesta:
   ``The Electoral College lock theory has about as much truth as
George Bush's television spots.''
   The Massachusetts governor, at airport rallies Tuesday in North
Dakota and Los Angeles, said he was looking forward to the
confrontation.
   ``One of the nice things about debates is they get people out
from behind the balloons and out of the flag factory and it gets
them to address the issues,'' the Democratic nominee said.
   On the flight here, his aides promised that Dukakis would be
ready to exchange one-liners with the vice president. More
importantly, they said, Dukakis hopes to convince voters that he
cares more about them and their children than Bush does.
   To underscore that point, Dukakis will discuss his recent
proposals on health care, housing and helping pay college expenses.
   ``This is not a pingpong match of one-liners,'' said John Sasso,
vice chairman of the Dukakis campaign and the candidate's closest
adviser. ``I think people are fed up with the meaningless labels.
Who's offering the leadership?''
   Sasso said Dukakis must convince the public that, under a
Democratic administration, they will get ``the benefit of the doubt
when the door of the Oval Office closes.''
   ``I think it's very important that the American people know his
values, know what he cares about,'' Sasso said.

<HEAD>California Growers Sue Over Preservative Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California grape growers sued Oregon over a
state rule that requires restaurants to post warnings when they
serve fresh foods treated with sulfite preservatives.
   The California Table Grape Commission, which represents 1,000
growers, fear restaurants will stop serving grapes rather than post
the warnings, said Bruce Obbink, commission president.
   That could cost growers and food distributors several hundred
thousand dollars, Obbink said by telephone from Fresno, Calif.
   Kristine Gebbie, director of the Oregon Health Divison, said she
could not comment on the lawsuit, filed the lawsuit Tuesday in
Marion County Circuit Court. until the state attorney general's
office reviewed the case.
   She said, however, that health officials made the right decision
when they ordered restaurants to warn customers when foods have
been treated with sulfites.
   ``We've got allergic people who can react to any level (of
sulfites) and the only way to protect them is to either ban all
products with sulfites, or warn them that it is present,'' Gebbie
said. ``As I understand it, for a very sensitive person, any level
of sulfite is a problem.''
   The emergency rule, which expires in February, was approved Aug.
26 by Health Division officials after they learned that restaurants
were serving California table grapes and other items that treated
with sulfites.
   The rule accompanies a 1985 regulation that prohibits
restaurants from treating fruits, vegetables and other salad items
with sulfite-based preservatives.
   The restriction was pushed by the Legislature after the death of
a 10-year-old girl who died after eating sulfite-treated guacamole
at a restaurant.
   The girl's family sued the maker and distributor of the sulfite
product used at the restaurant. The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled
last week that the maker and distributor were not liable for
damages.

<HEAD>USDA Estimates of Corn and Soybean Crops Up Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's drought-reduced corn crop is
expected to yield 4.55 billion bushels, an increase of 2 percent
from last month's estimate, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   The figure was still 36 percent below last year's harvest,
reflecting the heat and lack of rain that cut sharply into this
summer's production and still represented a five-year low.
   Soybean production was forecast at 1.5 billion bushels, another
gain of 2 percent from September's estimate, but still 22 percent
below 1987.
   The estimate was based on surveys made Oct. 1. A month ago, USDA
put the corn harvest at 4.46 billion bushels and the soybean crop
at 1.47 billion bushels.
   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American
farmers and as a feed is essential to the production of meat,
poultry and dairy products.
   Soybeans, which provide high-protein meal and quality vegetable
oil used in food processing, also are vital to U.S. food production.
   USDA's Agricultural Statistics Board forecast the cotton crop at
14.7 million bales, slightly below last year's harvest but above
the Sept. 1 estimate.
   Wheat production was reported at 1.8 billion bushels, about the
same as last month.
   The average yield for corn was estimated at 80.2 bushels per
acre, a sharp plunge from last year's figure of 119.4 bushels per
acre.
   ``Harvest was ahead of normal in the central and northern Plains
states,'' the report said. ``Crop maturity and harvest continued to
lag behind normal in most of the East.''
   In Chicago, influential analyst Conrad Leslie estimated soybean
production at 1.48 billion bushels and forecast a corn harvest of
4.55 billion bushels.
   His forecasts, which came out Monday, were higher than USDA's
September estimates. But analysts said Leslie's soybean production
figure was lower than expected and it sparked some buying of
futures.
   They said his corn production forecast was higher than expected
and sparked some selling of corn futures.
   Despite lowered production as a result of the drought, USDA
officials say stockpiles of corn are sufficient to prevent any
shortages. They have been estimating that the drought would add one
percent to the consumer price index for food this year and two
percent next year.
   The report said the ``all crops'' production index as of Oct. 1
averaged 89 percent of the base year of 1977, up 1 percent from
September.
   Crop production averaged 106 percent of the base last year. The
record was 117 percent reached in 1985 as well as 1982 and 1981.

   The Philippine government might delay
filing charges against Ferdinand E. Marcos until U.S. authorities
decide whether to prosecute the exiled former president, an
official said Wednesday.
   Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, said President Corazon Aquino's administration would
not ``seek to obstruct justice in other lands'' or permit filing of
charges here ``to be used as an excuse by Mr. Marcos to escape his
indictment abroad.''
   He spoke after reports that the U.S. State Department's legal
officer recommended Marcos be offered a deal to avoid prison by
surrendering millions of dollars allegedly embezzled during 20
years in power.
   Marcos and his family live in exile in Hawaii. The Philippine
government alleges Marcos ad his associates stole up to $10 billion
before his administration was toppled in the 1986 uprising that
swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that State Department
adviser Abraham Sofaer recommended the plea bargain to avoid
indicting and prosecuting a former head of state.
   The newspaper said U.S. officials feared Marcos would seek to
embarrass American and Filipino authorities by disclosing improper
or illegal conduct if he were indicted.
   The plea bargain proposal reportedly involves an investigation
of Marcos by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in New York into
alleged illegal money transfers and other activities.
   Caparas told reporters that even if Marcos accepted a plea
bargain, he would still face prosecution in the Philippines.
   Filipino officials have filed no criminal charges against Marcos
for fear he would demand his right to return to the Philippines for
trial. Philippine law bars criminal trials in absentia.
   Caparas' commission is in charge of recovering money allegedly
taken by Marcos. He told reporters that Mrs. Aquino had asked him
to issue the statement.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly refused to allow Marcos to return to
the Philippines, citing national security.
   Caparas said efforts by Marcos to return were ``either an excuse
to get out of America or a part of his campaign to destabilize the
present government.''
   Caparas also said American FBI agents seized $6 million worth of
paintings and other art objects during a raid last week on the
Woodside, California estate of Marcos' son-in-law, Gregorio Araneta.
   He said he expected the objects to be turned over to the
Philippine government because ``those paintings were purchased with
the Filipino peoples' money.'' Araneta is married to Marcos'
daughter, Irene.
   In San Francisco, U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello confirmed the
raid and said agents hauled away paintings, sculptures, Ming
Dynasty vases and antique furniture.

<TEXT>
   A merchant ship carrying New Zealand's America's
Cup racing yacht was released from Cuban custody and escorted into
international waters Wednesday, less than a day after its seizure,
the Coast Guard said.
   The brief detention was ``the maritime equivalent of `pull you
over and check your license,''' said Barney White, a spokesman for
the ship's agent, Zapata Gulf Marine of Houston.
   The Coast Guard said the ship, Tampa Seahorse, which was seized
Tuesday, is now proceeding to New York. The Cubans claimed it was
in their territorial waters, although the shipping firm denied that.
   Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Karonis said the Seahorse departed from the
Cuban port at about 12:40 p.m. EDT Wednesday and the Cuban harbor
pilots left 20 minutes later.
   ``They (crew) said they were seized, the vessel was inspected
and their passports were checked,'' Karonis said after the Coast
Guard in Miami talked to the ship by radio.
   ``The Cubans claimed their vessel was nine miles offshore,''
Karonis said. Cuba claims a 12-mile territorial limit.
   ``The information we have right now is that they are still going
to New York,'' he said. ``We have not been asked to meet them.''
   The ship is expected to reach New York on Monday afternoon
depending on sea and weather conditions, White said.
   Stephen Snider, press secretary for Connecticut Sen. Lowell
Weicker, said aides to the senator were told by officials at the
Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington that the crew members aboard
the ship were ``safe and well.''
   The eight crew members and one New Zealand passenger were
identified by White: Capt. Jeff Jappe, Ojai, Calif.; 1st Mate
George Wainwright, Panama City, Fla.; 2nd Mate Alan Belisle,
Cutoff, La.; Engineer Elmer Hinds, New Orleans; Sailor Roy Gaudet,
Raceland, La.; Sailor Alfred Shanahan, Phoenix; Oiler Ramone
Sobrado, Port Hueneme, Calif.; and cook George McClain, Fort White,
Fla.
   Also aboard was Matthew Montgomery of New Zealand, a member of
the syndicate which owns the racing yacht New Zealand.
   The disassembled sloop New Zealand was aboard the 160-foot
U.S.-registered merchant ship, officials said.
   The 133-foot boat was en route from California to New York City
for a 10-day stop and then a tour of East Coast cities.
   The Cubans seized the vessel off the southeastern tip of Cuba
without firing shots or using force, saying it had violated the
country's 12-mile territorial limit, the Coast Guard said. It was
detained in Puerto Cayo Moa, Cuba.
   Capt. Jappe radioed an urgent appeal Tuesday at 3 p.m. EDT to
the Coast Guard, insisting he was in international waters, but
Coast Guard officers advised him to comply with the Cubans, said
Coast Guard spokesman Dan Vogeley.
   Lowell Oswald, a spokesman for Zapata Marine, maintained the
ship was in international waters.
   Cuba detains foreign ships as often as once a month for
trespassing in its waters, but the vessels and crewmen usually are
quickly released, said Coast Guard Lt. Wayne Ball in Miami.
   San Diego-based Sail America managed the successful U.S. defense
of the America's Cup race by sailing the catamaran Stars & Stripes
against the single-hulled New Zealand last month off San Diego.
   Michael Fay, chairman of the New Zealand Challenge, forced the
San Diego Yacht Club into an early defense of the cup this year
after winning a court order that validated his challenge of race
rules.
   The New Zealand was twice as long as the traditional 12-meter
yachts used in cup competitions. The San Diego club responded by
building a dual-hulled catamaran to defend the Cup, and Dennis
Conner skippered the Stars & Stripes to two easy victories to sweep
a best-of-three series.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Maronite Christian spiritual leader
is making a list of up to seven candidates in hopes of getting U.S.
and Syrian support for a presidential election, several Beirut
newspapers reported Wednesday.
   ``He hopes the United States will use its good offices to
persuade Syria to approve two or three of them so the election can
be held,'' the independent daily An-Nahar said.
   Michel Abu Jawdeh, its leading columnist, urged Patriarch
Nasrallah Sfeir, the 65-year-old Maronite leader, to run for the
presidency himself.
   ``The qualifications of the president needed to save Lebanon
from its crisis fit only you and your friend Raymond Edde,'' he
wrote. ``It's a fateful responsibility which you will have to
shoulder. Otherwise there will be no Lebanon.''
   Edde, 75, is a veteran politician who moved to Paris in 1976
after surviving three assassination attempts.
   He has announced his candidacy for president and said he would
seek a commitment from the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France _ to make Israel leave its self-proclaimed
``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   Edde says that would prompt the withdrawal of Syrian and other
foreign forces from Lebanon. Syria has 40,000 soldiers stationed in
eastern and northern Lebanon and in Moslem west Beirut.
   Twenty-nine Christian members of Parliament have authorized
Sfeir to consult with Moslem factions, the United States and Syria
about presidential elections.
   By unwritten agreement among Lebanese religious groups, the
president is a Christian, the prime minister Sunni Moslem and the
Parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem. Christians also have controlled
the army and judiciary since independence from France in 1943.
   Christians were the majority in 1943, but Moslems now make up an
estimated 55 percent of the 4 million people and want an equal
share of power.
   The Christian bloc supporting Sfeir's effort and 16 Moslem and
leftist deputies issued separate identical statements this week
rejecting partition of Lebanon on sectarian lines and calling for a
speedy election. Both groups said it should occur before Parliament
speaker Hussein Husseini's term ends Oct. 18.
   Moslems have rejected the interim government headed by the
Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, that was appointed by
President Amin Gemayel as his 6-year term ended Sept. 23. They back
the incumbent Cabinet headed by Salim Hoss, a Sunni who is acting
prime minister.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon after 13 years of civil
war here, has pressed for election of either former President
Suleiman Franjieh, 78, or Parliament member Mikhail Daher, 58.
Daher was a compromise candidate who emerged from Syrian and U.S.
talks after a Christian boycott of Parliament blocked Franjieh's
candidacy.
   Christians who oppose Syria's military presence in Lebanon claim
both are too close to the Syrians.

<TEXT>
   Premier Mohammad Hasan Sharq said
Wednesday the government prefers a settlement with guerrilla field
commanders to a deal with leaders who direct the Moslem insurgency
from neighboring Pakistan.
   In a 90-minute meeting with five Western reporters, he made no
new offers that might persuadethe U.S.-supported guerrillas to stop
fighting.
   President Najib, the Communist Party chief, appointed Sharq on
May 26. The 63-year-old premier, who has close ties to Moscow but
is not a party member, has become increasingly visible as the
government spokesman.
   Najib has said he would broaden the base of his Soviet-backed
government by including non-party members.
   Speaking to the reporters Wednesday about negotiations with the
insurgents, Sharq said: ``If we are not able to have ways of
negotiating with all of them, we will have negotiations with some
of them. Those who are sharing the miseries of the people of
Afghanistan will come first.''
   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and the Soviet Union sent military forces to Afghanistan in
December 1979. Under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed last April,
the Soviets are withdrawing their estimated 115,000 soldiers.
   The guerrillas were not a party to the agreement between
Pakistan and Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union and United States
signed as guarantors, and conmtinued fighting.
   Najib's regime is trying to establish provincial ``coalition
governments'' including representatives of the insurgents. If
successful, the strategy could neutralize the guerrillas on a
piecemeal basis by persuading them to stop fighting in exchange for
local power.
   That would return Afghanistan to its pre-Soviet situation: a
weak central government that survives largely through coexistence
with powerful local leaders who fight to the death for their
villages, valleys or hilltops but do not threaten the capital.
   Sharq expressed willingness to talk with Afghan leaders inside
and outside the country, including deposed King Zahir Shah, to
establish a new government and end the war.
   Zahir Shah lives in Italy and his return as a constitutional
monarch is proposed periodically proposed as means of ending the
current impasse.
   The premier would not say whether Asadabad, capital of eastern
Kunar province, fell to the insurgents Monday night as their
leaders in Pakistan claimed.
   Referring to government forces in the town 12 miles from the
frontier, he said: ``Maybe they are now under control of the
coalition government.''
   He said he spoke by telephone Wednesday morning to the Kunar
governor in Asadabad, who was ``trying to establish a coalition
(provincial) government and he assured me of progress that he will
be able to establish it.''
   Sharq said Asadabad's defenders were local militiamen paid by
the government, not army troopers. He spoke in Dari, the Afghan
language, and government officials translated his comments into
English.
   Urging the United States and Pakistan to stop aiding the
guerrillas, he expressed the hope that elections in both countries
next month would bring policy changes and ``the smell of blood of
innocent people will no longer be to the liking of the leaders of
the United States of America.''
   Soviet resupply of the Afghan army is not the same, according to
Sharq. He said the Soviets had been providing arms to Afghanistan
for 35 years, since the time of Zahir Shah, who was overthrown in
1973 by his cousin and former prime minister, Mohammad Daoud.
   Daoud was killed in the coup five years later.
   U.S. aid to the guerrillas began in earnest when Soviet troops
entered Afghanistan.
   More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country during the
civil war and 3 million are in Pakistan, living in border towns and
refugee camps that serve as guerrilla bases and supply points.
   Kabul radio said the army had killed two foreigners and 319
``criminal extremists'' _ guerrillas _ in an attack on insurgents
in Zabul, a southeastern province.
   It did not identify the foreigners, but much of the broadcast
was devoted to charges of Pakistani involvement with the insurgency
and the radio claimed Pakistani army officers were fighting
alongside guerrillas inside Afghanistan.
   Since his apointment, Sharq has visited Moscow and meets
regularly with foreign reporters allowed to visit Kabul.
   Najib's photograph appears less frequently in Kabul newspapers
and nightly television newscasts no longer are dominated by lengthy
videotapes of the president's activities.
   Sharq served as chief of staff Daoud's government during the
monarchy.
   ``In spite of the fact that I was the second person who waged
the coup against King Zahir, I have never been opposed to Zahir
Shah personally, but only to the kingdom, to the monarchy,'' he
said Wednesday.

   Women helped launch the nation's major social
reforms of the 20th century, but now they need more political
power, speakers said Wednesday as they opened a first-ever
conference on women's role in the civil rights movement.
   Coretta Scott King, widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., said women continue to be a great moral force for social
change in the civil rights movement.
   She said during the opening session of the conference that the
next mission in the women's rights movement is to get more women
elected to political office, pointing out that only 23 of 435 House
seats and two of 100 Senate seats are held by women.
   She added that only one of those 25 women, Rep. Cardiss Collins,
D-Ill., is black. Three women are governors.
   ``Human survival in the future will depend on the political
empowerment of women. We women stood in the background and held
things up, to keep them going, over the years,'' Mrs. King said.
``We have a tremendous job to do each time we communicate with
younger people to help them understand what the conditions were so
that they can appreciate the progress that's been made and is
continuing.''
   Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of Negro
Women, said a forum to address issues concerning black women is
particularly necessary during the current political climate.
   ``It is needed today more than ever before,'' she said.
   About 75 participants attended the session, which was held in
historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, and sang songs from the civil
rights movement. The participants included female ministers,
activists, educators and students.
   The conference, being held at the Martin Luther King Center for
Nonviolent Social Change, was convened by Mrs. King and Rosa Parks,
who in 1955 refused to sit in the back of a Montgomery bus and
sparked protests that grew into the civil rights movement.
   The planners of the ``Women In The Civil Rights Movement'' say
it is the first such national conference and will be used as a
forum to address issues that affect women worldwide.
   Among those expected to participate are Molly Yard, president of
the National Organization of Women; author Margaret Walker
Alexander; Vivian Malone Jones, who integrated the University of
Alabama; Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.

   A mother of three held Wednesday for robbing
a bank was apparently frightened that her husband would discover
she'd squandered the family's savings, police said.
   The 36-year-old Kent City woman, whose only past scrape with the
law was a speeding ticket, was arrested at her mobile home Tuesday
less than two hours after robbing the Grant City Bank, 25 miles
north of Grand Rapids.
   ``The only thing I can say is she was having some financial
problems, and she did not care to face her husband about it,''
Police Chief Stan Osmolinski said. ``They had some money set aside
to purchase something, and it was squandered away.''
   ``I don't believe she's your everyday criminal. I believe she
deeply regrets doing this,'' he said.
   The woman was being held in the Montcalm County Jail on $5,000
bond, the chief said. She was expected to be arraigned Thursday on
armed robbery charges. Authorities said her name would be released
at that court appearance.
   Ross Scott, the bank's president, said the woman walked into the
bank about 3 p.m. and handed a teller a note that read: ``I want
all your money. Give me the $100s and $50s first. I have a gun.''
   Scott said the teller gave the woman an undetermined amount of
money but triggered a silent alarm.
   Police arrested the women at her mobile home after tracing a
license plate number scribbled down by a witness. Money was found
scattered throughout the woman's bedroom, police said. Authorities
also found a pellet gun at the scene.
   Authorities said the woman cooperated with police and told them
she was nervous during the robbery. ``She didn't think her legs
were going to hold up,'' Osmolinski said.
   Beverly Norvell, who lives next door to the woman, was home with
her family when police arrived. The suspect's children, aged 16, 14
and 13, were just returning from school, Norvell said.
   Norvell said the woman was silent as police led her to a squad
car, but said the woman's youngest daughter was crying.
   ``The children were kind of mystified,'' Osmolinski said,
calling the robbery a spur of the moment act. ``They were wondering
why. They had no idea why she would do something like this.''

<HEAD>FBI Investigation Urged in Tobacco Export Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tobacco exports wrongly certified as 100
percent U.S. grown and shipped under government credit guarantees
should come in for a full-scale FBI investigation, a tobacco-state
congressman said Wednesday.
   ``The harm that this corrupt blending practice has caused the
American tobacco farmer is inestimable,'' Rep. Robin Tallon,
D-S.C., said in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   The credit guarantees are supposed to be reserved for
American-grown crops only, although the Agriculture Department says
it will provide them for the American-grown portion of a blended
shipment if the foreign-produced portion does not exceed 25 percent
of the entire package.
   Fourteen of 19 exporters monitored by federal investigators
received government credit guarantees for entire shipments that
were certified as 100 percent American tobacco but which actually
blended U.S. and imported leaves, investigators told a House
agriculture subcommittee last week.
   The findings have agitated tobacco-state congressmen who say
they are not only concerned about potential fraud but believe the
credit guarantee program should be reserved for crops produced
exclusively by American farmers.
   The case already is under investigation by the U.S. attorney's
office in Raleigh, N.C., said lawmakers and officials of the
General Accounting Office and Department of Agriculture inspector
general's office.
   Tallon said in his letter he was ``shocked and angered'' to
learn of the wrong certification. ``By any definition this
constitutes fraud.''
   He said any exporters who deliberately misrepresented a shipment
as being completely American ``not only stole from the taxpayers of
this country but they also stole sales opportunities from our
tobacco farmers.''
   He asked Thornburgh to make sure that any such exporter be
``brought to justice.''
   Tallon in an interview acknowledged that the U.S. attorney in
Raleigh would most likely be free to call on the FBI for
assistance. But he said it was important to contact the attorney
general to urge such action.
   ``I don't know what kind of staff they have'' at the U.S.
attorney's office, he said. ``This thing is far more involved,
complex and complicated.'' He expressed hope that the FBI would
examine all pertinent records of exporters and banks that provided
advance payments to the exporters under the guarantee program.
   ``And the end users, the people who supposedly purchased the
tobacco,'' he said.
   Tallon also renewed his criticism of the way the matter has been
handled by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. The agency scoffed
at initial reports from Iraq that not all of the tobacco being
shipped was American.
   FAS Administrator Thomas O. Kay told the House Agriculture
Committee's tobacco and peanuts subcommittee last week that he had
no reason to doubt the word of the exporters. He said the complaint
from Iraq was explained to him as an ill-founded rumor started by a
disappointed Zimbabwean exporter.
   Tallon said, however, that testimony at the hearing left him
unsatisfied.
   ``The question begs to be answered: Who's trying to cover up
what?'' he said. ``I'm saying, bring in the FBI and see if anyone
else gets caught in the loop.''

<HEAD>Pit Bull Becomes Cause Celebre, Escapes From Pound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dutch, a pit bull terrier who
narrowly escaped being put to death for killing another dog, was
sprung from jail by someone with a love for animals and a pair of
sharp wire cutters.
   The case involving Dutch has pitted a district court judge
against a homemaker who claims Dutch should not be punished for
killing a small terrier in June.
   Judge Cornelia Terwee ruled Tuesday that Dutch should be taken
from his owner, 28-year-old Saskie Van Poeteren, and placed in a
new home. But hours later, Dutch was spirited away from an
Amsterdam kennel.
   Ms. Van Poeteren said she wasn't involved in the breakout but
that an anonymous caller telephoned her late Tuesday assuring her
Dutch was safe.
   ``The gentleman just said, `Don't worry, it'll be all right,'''
Ms. Van Poeteren told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
   Dutch's reprieve from death made him famous.
   Police ordered Dutch destroyed after he bit another dog to
death. But a local magistrate ruled that biting another dog did not
make Dutch a threat to the general public and ordered him returned
to Ms. Van Poeteren.
   The prosecutor's office appealed.
   Judge Terwee ruled the fault was with Ms. Van Poeteren, not
Dutch, because the pit bull was not on a leash at the time of the
attack.
   She ordered Dutch placed with a new owner and fined Ms. Van
Poeteren $36 for violating leash laws.
   Dutch television interviewed Ms. Van Poeteren Tuesday as she
wept outside the courthouse over the confiscation order.
   ``He was just the cutest little thing,'' she said. ``I was sure
I'd get him back.''
   The broadcast showed a family snapshot of Dutch wearing his
owner's sunglasses, and a close-up of Ms. Van Poeteren's goldfish,
apparently to illustrate her fondness for pets.
   Even the authoritative NRC Handelsblad newspaper published an
article on Dutch's trial under the headline, ``Judges Chewing Over
Pit Bull Case.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses 27 Counts in McMartin Molestation Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed nearly a third of the
charges in the McMartin preschool molestation trial Wednesday and
prosecutors moved to drop other counts, apparently because of
insufficient evidence.
   The 17-month prosecution case against Raymond Buckey and his
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, ended last week with three children
failing to testify.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders immediately granted a
prosecution motion to dismiss 27 counts based on their unheard
allegations. Prosecutors said the youngsters had refused to appear
because they were too traumatized.
   Deputy district attorneys Lael Rubin and Roger Gunson, who
sought to drop a total of 35 counts, said the judge should resolve
other matters before dismissing the eight counts based on testimony
of children who did appear at the trial.
   But defense attorney Danny Davis accused prosecutors of
attempting to ``cut their losses,'' by eliminating from the case
children who told incredibly bizarre stories of alleged
molestations.
   ``The truth of the matter is the evidence these childen
presented at the preliminary hearing was unbelievable,'' Davis said
outside court.
   Ms. Rubin and Gunson filed a new complaint listing 52
accusations against the 30-year-old Buckey, and 12 charges against
his 61-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, as well as one joint
conspiracy count.
   They cut the number of children allegedly molested from 14 to
11, nine of whom testified at the trial.
   Ms. Rubin told reporters the remaining evidence was sufficient
to convict the defendants.
   ``We've had testimony from nine children in this case and
medical evidence which strongly supports our position that children
were molested at the McMartin school,'' she said.
   Mrs. Buckey's attorney, Dean Gits, said the prosecution's action
was ``highly unusual,'' and said he'd never seen a similar
situation before.
   Davis called the development ``heartening,'' saying, ``Thirty
five counts are out without a breath wasted by the defense.''
   He added, ``It's a face-saving device. But it looks like major
plastic surgery is going on ... There is a major surgical slashing
of the prosecution case and it's by their own knife.''
   He equated it to ``the making of a $35 million settlement to a
$100 million lawsuit before the opposition has put on a case. I've
never seen that before.''
   Davis said he would move to excise even more charges in
arguments Thursday. He contends that at least four children who
testified spoke of acts that allegedly occurred beyond the six-year
statute of limitations for prosecution.
   If his argument succeeds, he said, 60 to 70 percent of the
charges would be gone. Pounders said he would study the law on
statute of limitations overnight.
   The McMartin case has been troubled from its inception and has
gone through repeated upheavals that diminished its scope.
   It began in 1984 with seven defendants and originally involved
claims that 41 children had been molested at the now defunct
McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
   After a two-year preliminary hearing, District Attorney Ira
Reiner dismissed charges against five former teachers, saying the
evidence against them was ``incredibly weak.''
   The trial began in April 1987. Prosecutors called their final
witnesses last week, and the defense is scheduled to begin next
week.
   On Wednesday afternoon, Pounders went to the the site of the
closed preschool to see whether jurors should be taken to view the
scene.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen said Wednesday the Republicans ``refuse to stand up
for the American economy'' and are avoiding issues important to
keeping the nation competitive.
   Bentsen, stalking votes in Missouri and Arkansas on the eve of
the second debate between George Bush and Michael Dukakis, also
aimed new barbs at Dan Quayle and accused Bush of trying
``character assassination'' against Dukakis.
   The Texas senator said the Democrats had no argument with
Quayle's assertion that other nations envy the United States.
   ``America is still the envy of the world,'' Bentsen told a crowd
of more than 2,500 outside the Columbia courthouse, many waving
tiny flags, ``but not because of people like Dan Quayle and George
Bush, who refuse to stand up for the American economy.''
   ``You don't stay number one by coasting,'' he said, responding
to Bush's assertion that the Democrats were trying to scare people
about foreign ownership of U.S. industries. Bentsen, chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee, pushed through the trade bill earlier
this year.
   ``America needs leaders who will stand up for the working people
of America,'' he said later at a rally at the University of
Arkansas at Fayetteville.
   He told the student audience that the Republicans consider
higher education a privilege of wealth, while Dukakis has proposed
a program so all qualified students could attend college.
   A strong contingent of pro-Bush students in the crowd of about
3,000 heckled as he spoke. They shouted ``Bush in `88'''and, when
Bentsen attacked the Republicans, ``Tell the truth, Lloyd.''
   Bentsen told the crowd it was a sign of how united the Democrats
are that he was ``saying nice things'' about Razorbacks just before
the Texas-Arkansas football game. The University of Texas alumnus
received an Arkansas football jersey that had his name over the
number ``88.''
   At rallies and in interviews Wednesday, Bentsen worked to make
sure Quayle remained a live issue for for Thursday night's debate.
   ``Today I read in the newspaper that Dan Quayle says he's going
to be his own campaign manager ... his own ``Dr. Spin Control,'' he
said at the Columbia podium. ``That may be his pitch, but I'll bet
it's thrown George Bush a real curve ball.''
   Extending the baseball metaphor, Bentsen said Bush's choice of
Quayle was another example of how the vice president ``swings and
misses.'' In the war against drugs: ``No runs, no hits, no
progress.''
   The crowd held up ``wanted'' posters with unflattering photos of
George Bush. He was ``missing in the war on drugs,'' the posters
said.
   ``And now Dan Quayle. He's no JFK and he's no candidate for
rookie of the year,'' Bentsen said. ``At some point, George Bush
has to take some responsibility for the quality of his decisions.''
   In interviews with local reporters, Bentsen rebelled at the
notion that Quayle might be getting sympathy because of the debate
outcome.
   ``Mike Dukakis is a man who's been subjected to a virtual
character assassination'' by a Republican campaign afraid to face
the issues,'' he said. ``There ought to be some sympathy for Mike
Dukakis.''
   As for backlash from his attack on Quayle during the debate,
Bentsen said it was ``minimal.'' If people felt sympathy for
Quayle, he said, ``That would be misplaced.''
   Bentsen said Dukakis would do ``an excellent job'' in his debate
Thursday night. After the first two debates, he and Dukakis ``were
2-0,'' he said.
   ``I think we'll go 3-zip,'' he predicted.

<TEXT>
   The nation's orange harvest for the 1988-89
crop season is forecast at 217 million boxes, 10 percent more than
last season, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   In its first forecast for 1988-89 production, USDA estimated
Florida's orange harvest at 152 million boxes, 10 percent above the
figure for 1987-88.
   California production was forecast at 61 million boxes, 8
percent higher than last year's harvest. Arizona's crop was put at
2.4 million boxes, a 33 percent gain over 1987-88 output.
   The report said Texas production was expected to be 1.65 million
boxes, compared with 1.43 million boxes last season.
   California's grapefruit production was estimated at 66.7 million
boxes, a 5 percent increase over last year. The Florida forecast
was for a record high of 57.0 million boxes, 6 percent above last
year.
   The Arizona crop was forecast at 1.3 million boxes, down 13
percent, and the Texas estimate was for 4.5 million boxes compared
with 3.8 million boxes last season.

   A school bus ran off a road, jumped
into a ditch and landed in a field Wednesday, sending 31 children
to a hospital, authorities said.
   No serious injuries were reported, but Cache County School
District spokesman Keith Hansen said eight children remained
hospitalized late Wednesday with injuries ranging from a fractured
leg to minor head and abdominal injuries.
   All the children were from the Newton area, authorities said,
and ranged in age from 5 to 10.
   The bus was carrying 64 children between Newton and Trenton and
was en route to the Lewiston Elementary School when the driver was
distracted by a child asking a question, Hansen said.
   ``The bus went off the shoulder of the road and in order to keep
it from rolling over, the driver jumped a canal and the bus landed
in a field,'' Hansen said.
   He said the driver, Ned Phelps, has driven school buses for many
years.
   Hansen said Phelps was ``extremely shaken'' and was kept at the
hospital for observation.
   Phelps' son, Sam Phelps, 8, was one of the children hospitalized.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Monument To Women Who Served In Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate gave voice-vote approval Wednesday
night to a bill authorizing a monument to American women who served
in the Vietnam War.
   The bill, approved earlier by the House, does not specify the
location of the memorial to the 10,000 American women who were in
the nation's longest war, other than to say it must be placed
somewhere in the Washington metropolitan area.
   The measure is a substitute for earlier legislation which had
proposed the addition of a nurse's statue to the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial on the grassy mall that stretches from the Capitol to the
Lincoln Memorial.
   That bill had been endorsed by the Senate in June on a 96-1
vote, but was opposed by two of the three federal agencies whose
approval would have been required. Critics said the addition of
another statue to the Vietnam memorial would have violated the
artistic integrity of one of the city's most popular national
monuments.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunny skies warmed much of the nation Wednesday, although rain
and some snow hit a few areas of the West, and the East, from the
Appalachians to New England.
   Showers in eastern Nevada and western Utah turned to occasional
thundershowers by late morning and snow showers continued into the
afternoon over the mountains of both West Virginia and north
central Pennsylvania and in central New England.
   About 3 inches of snow fell by Wednesday morning at Clymer,
N.Y., and 2 inches at Great Valley, N.Y.
   Cold northwest winds were expected to continue to bring freezing
temperatures Wednesday night from the Great Lakes and the Ohio
Valley into the Appalachians.
   Frost or freeze advisories were posted for Wednesday night over
much of Michigan, Indiana, southern Illinois, Ohio, western West
Virginia, Kentucky, western Virginia, the Maryland Panhandle,
inland New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, the inland portions of the
Carolinas, the mountains of northeast Georgia, and northern Alabama.
   A light freeze was expected in northern and eastern Tennessee,
with frost scattered over the remainder of the state.
   Frost and freeze warnings were posted Wednesday for much of
lower Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, western West Virginia,
South Carolina, inland North Carolina and the mountains of
northeast Georgia.
   Temperatures were unseasonably chilly and more than a dozen low
temperature records for October 12 were broken or tied.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 92 degrees at Needles, Calif. The
low temperature Wednesday was 8 degrees in Embarrass, Minn.
   The forecast for Thursday called for scattered snow showers in
the higher elevations of northern Maine. Rain was expected from the
northern Pacific Coast across the Idaho Panhandle and northwest
Montana, with cloudy skies over the central Pacific Coast. Strong,
gusty winds were expected in the northern half of the Rockies.
   High temperatures in the 30s were forecast for northern Maine,
in the 40s and 50s from central Maine into northern South Carolina,
through the Appalachians, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes.
Temperatures were expected to reach the 80s in southern Florida,
and southern and western Texas. Highs through the desert Southwest
were forecast from the 80s to the mid 90s. High temperatures in the
remainder of the nation were forecast for the 60s and 70s.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers trapped in a 22-story
building hung out of windows and shouted to be rescued from flames
and thick smoke Wednesday in a fire that officials said killed one
person and injured 124 others.
   It took two hours to put out the blaze at the government-run
Banco do Brasil building, located in the busiest intersection of
downtown Rio.
   Firefighters broke through walls of adjacent buildings to pull
people to safety. Hundreds of office workers fled in panic.
   The fire was confined to the bottom three floors of the bank
building, but enormous amounts of heavy smoke billowed from every
floor, casting a haze for blocks over the congested business
district.
   ``The fire started at the worst time: 4 p.m., near the end of
the workday and just at the start of the rush hour,'' fire
department Col. Fernando Vieira, in charge of the rescue operation,
said at the scene.
   ``The traffic was terrible. And because it was raining, that
intensified the smoke, and we couldn't see people in the windows
crying for help.''
   Smoke was so thick that at times it hid from view workers who
hung out of windows and screamed for help.
   Fernando Pinto, who was pulled from a smoke-filled room, said:
``It was terrifying. I thought the ladder would never reach me. I
saw the smoke getting thicker and prayed I would get out in time.''
   Col. Flavio Fagundes of the Rio de Janeiro Fire Department said
about 400 people were in the 1940s-era building, when fire broke
out.
   Construction workers had been renovating the bottom three floors
of the building at the intersection of Rio Branco and Presidente
Vargas avenues, said Public Security director Helio Saboya.
   He said the blaze began on the first floor but the cause was
still undetermined.
   Many workers escaped by crossing over to an adjoining building.
Others climbed stairs to the roof to await rescue by police
helicopters.
   ``About 50 of us were working on the 10th floor, when all of a
sudden smoke started coming through the ventilating system,'' bank
employee Antonio Soares told The Associated Press. ``The building
safety rules tell you that in case of a fire to go down, but when
we got to the fourth floor, everything was blocked because of
construction work.
   ``We went back to the eighth floor. Somebody found a big hammer,
and we smashed a hole in the wall and got through to the building
next door.''
   People at the scene said it took 30 minutes for the fire
department to arrive.
   According to fire department Col. Maurice Ortiz, 70 people were
treated for smoke inhalation at local emergency centers and 55
others were sent to a hospital. Nine of the 55 were in critical
condition and one died, said Dr. Fatima Bressan of the Souza Aguiar
hospital.
   On Feb. 17, 1986, fire in a downtown Rio office building killed
24 people. Three people jumped to their deaths in desperation and
21 others died from burns or asphyxiation.

   The first baseball team from the Soviet Union
to visit the United States may not have defensive whizzes or
offensive sluggers. But there's no question about its eagerness.
   The team interrupted its first sight-seeing tour of the nation's
capital to watch the major-league playoffs.
   ``They didn't want to be rude, but the older players wanted to
watch the game (Game 4 between the Oakland Athletics and the Boston
Red Sox),'' said Rick Spooner, an American who serves as the coach
of the Soviet team.
   The opportunities this week to watch the playoffs has been a big
part of the trip for a team playing a game that is only 1{ years
old in the Soviet Union.
   ``Constantly we're trying to watch,'' said Andrei Borodin, the
team's coach and first baseman. ``If there's any possibility, we
stay in front of the game all the time.''
   The Soviet team, which hails from the Mendeleyev Institute of
Chemical Technology, played the first U.S.-Soviet baseball game in
the United States on Wednesday against a Johns Hopkins University
squad.
   The Soviets lost, 16-0.
   They committed 11 errors.
   They had no hits.
   They did have six baserunners, one on an error, five on walks,
but the game was never close. The Johns Hopkins team scored eight
unearned runs in the first inning _ on only four hits.
   The results weren't much different when a team from Johns
Hopkins visited the Soviet Union recently. The U.S. team soundly
beat Mendeleyev, considered the strongest Soviet team, in all three
games. The Americans also gave clinics and other instruction to
their Russian counterparts.
   The Mendeleyevs went on to win four baseball tournaments this
year, playing throughout the Soviet Union.
   ``When I was there I said they were comparable to a junior
varsity high school team,'' said Johns Hopkins Coach Bob Babb.
``Now I'd say they're equivalent to a high school team. And a
pretty good high school team when they put all their best people on
the field.''
   The defensive skills of the game have come slowest to the
Soviets.
   ``Their fielding, hitting cutoffs, fly balls, still give them
trouble,'' Babb said. ``But their hitting has improved
tremendously.''
   The Soviet Union would like to field a baseball team in the 1992
Summer Olympics.
   ``If we follow the course of our basketball players, it will
take 5-7 years and we will be playing with the best teams in
Europe,'' Bogatiryov said. ``I can't talk about the Americans.''
   Still, the game against Americans was important.
   ``I think they're feeling the pressure of this game,'' Babb
said. ``They're here trying to represent the Soviet Union in our
sport. They believe they must make a good showing to get the
support they need back home.''
   There are no baseball fields in the Soviet Union. When Johns
Hopkins played the Soviets on Russian soil, the two teams played on
a soccer field with a chalk-drawn circle for a pitcher's mound.
   So, the Johns Hopkins' facility _ a diamond with dugouts and a
batting cage _ is one not to be wasted. An extra daily practice has
already been squeezed into the Soviets' schedule.
   ``They'd like to stay out on the field all day,'' Spooner said.
   What do they think of the playoffs?
   ``They're awed,'' Babb said. ``They ask a lot of questions, `Why
(do) things happen in a game?' Having studied the game game for
only a year and a half, to see the strength of these players
boggles their minds.''

   Authorities said Wednesday a former
volunteer firefighter is suspected of setting 16 suspicious blazes
that have terrified this town since May and prompted residents to
sleep in shifts and form night patrols.
   Plainclothes police officers hustled Lance Lalumiere, 23, into
the police station in neighboring Lancaster, where he was arraigned
on one felony arson charge stemming from a fire at his brother's
cabin. Bail was set at $50,000.
   State Safety Commissioner Richard Flynn said the state will seek
indictments against Lalumiere, charging him with setting 15 other
fires.
   Five of the 21 suspicious fires apparently were set by others,
said state Police Lt. Gary Sloper, who declined to give details,
including how many suspects there are and whether any of the
suspects acted in concert.
   Sloper also declined to say whether authorities believe
Lalumiere acted alone in the 16 fires.
   ``We do anticipate further arrests,'' Sloper said of the five
fires.
   The weekly Coos County Democrat reported Wednesday that
Lalumiere's brother, Michael, said Lance Lalumiere had been taken
Tuesday to the Twin Mountain police barracks in neighboring Carroll.
   ``He is upset,'' the brother told the paper. ``There's a
definite mental strain; there's no doubt about that.''
   Jefferson, a quiet hamlet of 850 people, has had 21 suspicious
or confirmed arson fires since a May 5 grass fire. A barn was the
next target, then empty homes and later occupied ones. Most of the
fires were set late at night, many at the back of buildings.
   No one has been killed or seriously hurt, although some people
barely escaped and lost their homes.
   Despite the arrest, many residents said they were still fearful.
Most still refused to give their names for fear of retribution.
   One woman said she would not rest easy until every fire is
explained and every arsonist convicted.
   ``Until then, I leave my light on and I'm going to stay up with
a gun,'' she said.
   As the toll of scorched structures mounted, many families began
sleeping in shifts and abandoned vacation plans. Some residents
began night patrols. Police feared vigilante violence.
   ``I have a feeling we're developing the same callus you develop
in Belfast or Beirut,'' Charles Bond, a state senator and Jefferson
resident, said last week. ``If a car bomb is going to blow up in
front of your house, it's going to happen. You're scared, but you
have to live with it.''
   Lalumiere once worked for the town's volunteer fire department
but was asked to quit when he moved to nearby Groveton. He has
since moved back to Jefferson, where he works nights as a
dishwasher at a restaurant.
   Lalumiere has been staying at the Skywood Manor motel in
Jefferson since August. William Perkins, who has lived at the motel
since his home burned in May, said he doubts Lalumiere is involved.
   ``I think they've got the wrong fish in a cage,'' Perkins said.
   A co-worker also defended Lalumiere on Wednesday.
   ``A couple of times there's been fires and he's been right here
in the room across from me,'' said the man, who did not want his
name used.
   Sloper said Lalumiere had been a suspect for some time.
   ``It's taken a great deal of time and effort to ... make sure
(we had) more than a reasonable amount of evidence to present,'' he
said.
   The fire for which Lalumiere was charged occurred Aug. 23 at his
brother Michael's cabin. It was the 19th suspicious blaze to break
out. Lance Lalumiere reported the fire and was trying to extinguish
it when firefighters arrived. He was questioned for eight hours
afterward and police searched his home and car.
   In an interview two days later, Lalumiere told the Democrat:
``All I tried to do was save my brother's house and this is the
thanks I get.''
   Lalumiere, who had been followed constantly by police, again
denied any involvement in the fires in a Democrat interview last
month.

   Israel and China will establish diplomatic
relations soon, but the timing depends on progress in Middle East
peace negotiations, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
   Israel television said officials of the two governments signed a
trade agreement Wednesday in Beijing. State radio said each side
established government-run corporations to promote trade.
   Avraham Tamir, director-general of the Foreign Ministry, said on
Israel television that diplomatic ties with China hinged on how the
Middle East peace process advances. He added that efforts to
achieve peace in the region would continue and ties with China
would be a reality ``in the very near future.''
   He confirmed news reports that Israel would establish an
academic center in Beijing but denied the first official Israeli
institution to be set up in China would have a political purpose.
   The state television report said Yitzhak Minervi, the ministry's
top economic official, signed the trade agreement on behalf of
private Israeli companies.
   It said the governments soon would begin negotiating an
agreement for Chinese coal exports to Israel. In the past, China
has rejected requests to sell coal directly to Israel.
   Maariv, an independent daily newspaper, said the new Israeli
trading company was called Copeco and 20 possible projects were
under study. A government official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said they focused on agriculture, medicine and medical
technology.
   Israel radio described the two companies as ``virtual chambers
of commerce or interest sections.''
   Three Israeli academics are in China to discuss the Middle East
situation. One of them, Professor Galia Golan of Hebrew University,
said in a radio interview the moves toward cooperation represent a
Chinese effort ``to increase contacts with Israel and to try to
warm relations on a semi-official basis.''
   ``The signal they are definitely giving is that, short of
diplomatic relations, they would like to improve contacts with
Israel,'' she said.
   On Tuesday, the daily Jerusalem Post said 30 members of the
Peking Opera will perform in Israel next May under a contract
signed in Belgium by Israeli and Chinese officials.
   There have been reports of arms trade between the two countries,
not confirmed by either side. The Sunday Times of London has said
Israeli military technicians were modernizing Soviet-built tanks
and heavy artillery used by the Chinese army.

   Workers scrambled Wednesday to transform
UCLA's basketball arena into a television studio where the debate
between George Bush and Michael Dukakis could help decide the
Election Day choices of millions of voters.
   Debate organizers trucked in sets, lecterns and equipment
straight from the Oct. 5 vice presidential debate in Omaha, Neb.
They said things were going smoothly despite the time crunch.
   As the Republican and Democratic nominees spent a quiet day
preparing for their second and final debate, Ed Fouhy, executive
producer for the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates,
said the frenzy was ``intense'' inside the Pauley Pavilion on the
UCLA campus.
   Fouhy said his job was made easier because this university of
34,000 students is accustomed to handling big events.
   ``They have a whole special events staff that's used to doing
these things,'' he said. ``We plugged into that.''
   UCLA served as the athletes' housing center and site of the
gymnastics competition for the 1984 Olympic Games, and last year
entertained Britain's visiting Prince Andrew and the Duchess of
York.
   Vice Chancellor Alan Charles said the debate was ``a pretty big
deal'' but nothing the university can't handle.
   The University of California campus in Los Angeles was selected
last Friday after the League of Women Voters withdrew as debate
sponsor in a dispute with the Bush and Dukakis campaigns.
   The debates commission, established by both campaigns to handle
the first presidential debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Sept. 25,
quickly succeeded the league as sponsor of the Los Angeles event.
   Commission director Janet Brown said the league's original
debate site, the old Shrine Auditorium near downtown Los Angeles,
was vetoed when the league demanded reimbursement of $90,000. She
said UCLA offered free use of its 13,000-seat basketball arena.
   And on Wednesday, the Los Angeles City Council voted 11-2 to
give $25,000 to help fund the presidential debate.
   ``I would have supported it if it was open to the public,'' said
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who dissented because only 1,500 people
will be allowed in the 12,500-seat arena and the audience of chosen
Republicans and Democrats would be waiting to cheer their
candidate's ``hot shot statements.''
   At the sprawling West Los Angeles campus, the floor of the arena
was being covered and carpeted Wednesday and partitioned off from
the rows of bleachers that will go unused during the debate.
   Organizers said 2,000 tickets will be distributed for the debate
audience in keeping with the intimate, TV studio atmosphere that
characterized the Winston-Salem debate and the Oct. 5 vice
presidential matchup in Omaha, Neb.
   The red-carpeted stage, the deep blue backdrop and oak lecterns
that were used in the previous debates were installed in the arena.
A press center was set up in the nearby student union building for
an estimated 3,000 journalists and crews covering the event.
   The debate format also will be the same. Each candidate will
have two minutes to answer a question and one minute for rebuttal,
with brief closing statements. The panelists will be moderator
Bernard Shaw of Cable News Network, Andrea Mitchell of NBC, Ann
Compton of ABC and Margaret Warner of Newsweek magazine.
   Janet Brown asked the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday to
contribute funds to defray debate costs, which she said probably
would be substantially more than the $500,000 required for the last
debate.
   Raising private money for the debate has ``been a hustle,'' she
said.

   The House is expected to take up compromise
legislation Thursday to require banks, retail stores and other
issuers of credit cards to provide more information to consumers
about interest rates and other charges.
   The measure, which still falls short of the disclosure
requirements sought by some members of Congress and consumer
groups, likely will be sent to the White House by the end of the
week. The Senate passed it late Tuesday.
   Senate-House negotiators met last week to iron out the
differences between separate bills passed earlier by their
respective chambers.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
consumer affairs subcommittee, walked out of that session because,
he said, Rep. Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the full
Banking Committee, would not permit him to air complaints about the
measure before the conferees.
   ``This bill does not help the consumer,'' said Annunzio.
   Leslie Gainer, an official of the Ralph Nader-organized U.S.
Public Interest Research Group, agreed somewhat with Annunzio,
saying the legislation fails to go far enough with the new
disclosure rules and pre-empts states from passing stronger laws.
   Said Ms. Gainer: ``Unfortunately, congressional banking
conferees crafted a bill which will wipe out existing state law,
prohibit states from acting in the future and allow the credit-card
industry to operate under a single new federal law.''
   The bill requires disclosure of annual fees, the interest rate
charged for unpaid balances, the method for calculating that
balance and the length of grace periods during which no interest is
charged. Similarly, late fees, over-the-limit fees, and fees for
cash advances must be disclosed.
   It requires that information to be provided in all direct-mail
solicitations for applicants. In other cases, however, some of the
information need not be provided until the consumer already has
been provided a card. Ms. Gainer and others argue the disclosures
should be up-front in all cases.
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., noted during the final Senate
debate Tuesday night that ``The initial motivation for this
legislation came from the high costs consumers are paying to use
their credit cards. While most interest rates were declining by
about 50 percent during the early 1980s, credit card interest rates
not only didn't fall, they rose.''
   With nearly 106 million Americans holding 800 million credit
cards, Dodd said, the impact of even small changes in rates and
fees can be vast. ``Even a 1 percent decline in interest rates
would save consumers about $700 million,'' he said.
   The Consumer Bankers Association, which represents approximately
800 federally insured banks, savings and loans and credit unions,
endorsed the legislation.
   Joe Belew, CBA president, said the measure ``provides for
simple, ;meaningful disclosures which ensure that consumers can
compare terms on credit cards. Its enactment will show that
consumer and industry representatives can work together to produce
legislation which benefits the public.''
   Ms. Gainer acknowledged that the bill ``does provide significant
assistance to consumers in states that have not yet passed
disclosure laws. In fact, now, most state laws are not as
comprehensive in certain areas as the federal bill is.''
   But she noted that the states would be precluded from enacting
tougher disclosure requirements, including the length that rate and
fee terms remain available to prospective applicants, whether the
issuer reserves the right to change the terms after the contract
has been signed, and whether an out-of-state issuer is complying
with the state's interest rate ceiling.

   Republican vice presidential candidate
Dan Quayle, saying he had reached a ``snapping point'' over control
of his campaign by Bush aides, declared Wednesday that from now on
``I am my own handler.''
   ``I'm going to have fun, and I'm going to say what's on my
mind,'' Quayle told reporters as he left Indianapolis en route to
South Dakota for a fund-raiser and speech.
   The Indiana senator said he was ``not mad at anybody in the Bush
campaign.'' However, he had previously expressed irritation at
published reports quoting unidentified aides to GOP presidential
nominee George Bush as calling him a liability for the ticket. Over
the weekend, he complained to Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker
III.
   Quayle also has chafed at the rigid format dictated by the
``handlers'' from the Bush campaign, limiting his access to the
press, scripting prepared texts for him to read and even
determining when he would wave as he got off his campaign plane.
   He told reporters ``that's all been thrown away.''
   Aides said the decision to publicly assert control of more
aspects of his campaign was Quayle's alone and was not yet another
new script handed down from Bush officials. But Quayle's aides,
many of them Baker intimates, were openly delighted that the story
was dominating Quayle's campaign day.
   Beyond his speaking out, it was unclear what changes might be
seen in Quayle's campaign. His schedule is still determined by Bush
strategists, and even Quayle said he would continue to deliver the
speeches prepared for him. Those are cleared, at least in early
draft form, by the Bush campaign.
   ``There'll be some off-the-cuff (remarks), but there'll be some
scripted. I've learned that there is a certain value in having a
script,'' Quayle said.
   He said he will still coordinate with Bush officials and ``stay
in close communication with them.''
   ``They're going to suggest things that I say, suggest things
that I do, and I'm going to take that under consideration,'' he
said.
   Quayle said that as one who has successfully run for elective
office in the past, ``I know how to get votes and I know what's
best for George Bush.''
   ``I've done it their way this far and now it's my turn,'' he
added.
   He said he has cordial relations with Baker, the campaign
chairman. The two men spoke at length on Tuesday night.
   Baker said Wednesday in Los Angeles: ``These things are really
very regrettable and I certainly understand why he would be steamed
up about them. If I could find out who was putting them out, we'd
have fewer people working in the campaign.
   He said ``we're going to make a little effort'' to find out who
on the staff was talking to the media.
   Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate said Baker had told a senior staff
meeting last Friday ``at the vice president's recommendation'' that
any member of Bush's campaign staff who criticized Quayle faced
possible dismissal.
   The matter had come to a head last Friday, two days after the
vice presidential debate, when anonymous Bush aides were quoted as
saying Quayle had not done well in the debate and was a liability
to the ticket.
   ``I think there is a snapping point that everyone goes through
and it snapped about Friday sometime, last Friday,'' Quayle said.
   This week Quayle started telling reporters, ``I don't anybody to
say well, here's what some campaign aide said about it. You ask me
and I'll give you the answer.''
   Although Quayle has been more accessible to reporters since the
debate, he has still not held a formal news conference since Sept.
15. He said he will try to have one soon.

<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney on Wednesday
unveiled a plan aimed mainly at stopping massive, uncontrolled
burning in the Amazon jungle by farmers and ranchers which has
aggravated the worldwide ``greenhouse effect.''
   The program, called ``Our Nature,'' calls for a temporary end to
government tax and financing benefits for large-scale cattle
ranching in the northern Amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessed
tropical timber.
   Environmentalists have charged that the clearing of vast Amazon
tracts by the primitive slash-and-burn method has released hundreds
of tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere.
   They say this causes the greenhouse effect, the gradual warming
of the Earth's atmosphere by a concentration of pollutants that act
like a blanket, trapping the sun's warmth.
   Brazil's government-run Space Research Institute said about
77,000 square miles of land were cleared by the slash-and-burn
method in 1987 and forecast a similar amount for this year.
   ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all
passengers in the adventure of Man on Earth,'' Sarney said in a
ceremony announcing the program. ``The era of unlimited natural
resources is over.''
   The ``Our Nature'' program also contains a recommendation to
Brazil's Congress to cut mercury imports. Free-lance gold
prospectors throughout the Amazon use the highly toxic element to
separate gold from river silt and then throw the waste into the
water.
   ``This program is going to shake up powerful economic
interests,'' said Antonio Jose Guimaraes, president of Brazil's
federal Forest Service. ``But the government is resolved to carry
it out.''
   Earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the poor Amazon
Basin, which covers an area equal to roughly two-thirds of the 48
continental United States, permitted land developers to burn off 50
percent of their properties _ the fastest and cheapest way to open
up clear areas _ and then gave them tax deductions for doing so.
   The World Bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of
land-clearing in the Brazilan Amazon has destroyed 240,000 square
miles of natural tropical rainforest cover _ an area larger than
California.
   Interior Minister Joao Alves said the tax break suspensions were
temporary, because the government is working out a plan to
determine which parts of the Amazon can be used for farming and
ranching and which must be left alone.
   Even before ``Our Nature'' was announced, private Amazon
developers complained about the plan.
   Orlando Mariutti, who has three projects on a total of 136,000
acres in the western state of Mato Grosso, told the newspaper Folha
de S. Paulo that ``Cutting tax incentives will hold back
development of the Amazon.''
   Large developers in the region, he said, ``generally preserve
more than the 50 percent of the land required by law.''

   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale said
Wednesday he declined an invitation to be interviewed for president
of the University of Minnesota, a decision that disappointed his
top backer for the post, Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   ``I've told the selection committee that I will not be a
candidate,'' Mondale said. ``You know, I love our university, what
it's meant to me and to so many of us ... but I just could not
persuade myself that this was the best role I could play. It's a
different world, you know, administering an academic community, and
it just didn't seem the right thing for me to do.''
   Mondale, a lawyer, had not expressed interest in the job
publicly, but Perpich had promoted him as the successor to Kenneth
Keller, who resigned as the university's president last March.
   Perpich said by telephone from his home in Gilbert that he was
disappointed by Mondale's decision but added, ``life goes on.''
   Perpich said he didn't try to persuade Mondale to reconsider
after Mondale told him of his decision Tuesday.
   ``You have to really want that; it's a difficult job,'' Perpich
said.
   The governor said persuading lawmakers to approve his budget
requests for the university would have been much easier with
Mondale at the helm.
   ``I was a little bit selfish,'' Perpich said. ``I wanted someone
to help carry that burden, and he would have done it and I think
very successfully.''
   The university's credibility has been damaged by turmoil over
spending on the university president's residence and office, which
led to Keller's resignation, and other problems during the year.
   Mondale, a former U.S. senator from Minnesota who returned to
the state to practice law following his unsuccessful 1984
Democratic presidential bid, said he has no current plans to run
for political office in the future.

<TEXT>
   A dispute between scientists has left 200 rare
and pampered rats without a hole to call their own.
   Carefully bred for up to 125 generations by Gordon Harrington of
the University of Northern Iowa, the rats represent rare genetic
strains. Some are masters at racing through rat mazes, while others
were bred with various personalities, or are drunks or drug addicts.
   The rats have bounced between Iowa and Michigan since they were
evicted last month from Lafayette Clinic, a state mental health
facility, The Detroit News reported Wednesday.
   ``I'm not sure what is going on,'' said Harrington, a psychiatry
professor. ``I have devoted my career to the rats. They are the
product of from 75 to 125 generations of precise breeding and
considerable study. But I suppose if we don't resolve it, this will
bring it to an end.''
   For years, the rats were bred in Harrington's lab in Cedar
Falls, Iowa. But in March 1986, a lab fire wiped out half his 1,800
rats. The lab was closed.
   Harrington took some of the luckless rodents home with him, and
sent others to laboratories around the world.
   In January 1987, the Lafayette Clinic hired Harrington on
condition that he bring along at least 100 of his special rats. He
brought 200, and the rats enjoyed a warm welcome.
   But they fell out of favor when Harrington was dismissed after
spending a month at overseas medical conventions. Clinic officials
contend Harrington had no research plans for the rats.
   ``He was parading around Australia, completing ignoring these
rats,'' said Dr. Norman Rosenzweig, acting chairman of Wayne State
University's psychiatry department. The Lafayette Clinic is run by
the state but staffed by psychiatry professors from Wayne State.
   Harrington denies neglecting his rats. He maintains that his
troubles stem from rejecting a Lafayette colleague's request to
receive credit on any research material published by Harrington.
   After dismissing Harrington, the clinic tried to send his rats
packing as well. But when the rodents arrived in Cedar Falls,
Harrington refused to accept them.
   The rodents spent part of last week in a shipping office until
the Humane Society in nearby Waterloo, Iowa, offered the rats
temporary shelter.
   Wayne State officials said they felt sorry for the rats, and
sent a truck on Saturday to pick them up. The rats are now in an
animal research facility while school officials ponder their fate.

Party has become ``the party of working people'' as he carried his
campaign for George Bush into the battleground states of the
industrial Northeast Wednesday.
   ``The party that so many of us grew up with still exists, except
today it's called the Republican party, and I'm asking all of you
to come home and join me,'' Reagan said at a Columbus Day dinner
here.
   Earlier, the president told students and teachers at Upper Darby
High School in the suburbs of Philadelphia that he is concerned
about young people's future and ``the decisions we Americans make
at the polls this year will determine whether or not that future
will be bright.''
   The president mingled public speeches with private Republican
fund-raising sessions, meeting with 70 people who paid $5,000
apiece for a reception at a Philadelphia restaurant and attending a
similar function at an airport hotel after arriving in Newark on
his way to West Orange.
   In Philadelphia, he also met with Archbishop Anthony J.
Bevilacqua, head of the city's 1.3 million Roman Catholics, and
with the family of a policeman gunned down in the line of duty.
   In his West Orange speech, he reminded the audience that in his
earlier years he was a Democrat, and ``it is often said that the
once-proud Democratic party of FDR and Harry Truman is dead and
gone, that the Democratic party has been taken over by the left,
that the departure from the mainstream that we began to see at
their 1968 convention now defines the party at the national level,
especially the liberal leadership in Congress.''
   ``But there is something you should know,'' he added. ``The
party of FDR and Harry Truman couldn't be killed.
   ``You see, the secret is that when the left took over the
Democratic party, we took over the Republican party. We made the
Republican party into the party of working people, the family, the
neighborhood, the defense of freedom, and, yes, the American flag
and the Pledge of Allegiance to `one nation under God.'''
   The menu for the $20-a-plate Columbus Day dinner was salad,
ziti, meatballs, sausage, dessert and coffee. The affair was
co-sponsored by Italian Americans of Essex County and the Italian
Tribune, a Newark-based weekly newspaper.
   When he left the archbishop's home in Philadelphia, Reagan met
with the family of Edward M. Setzer, a policeman who was killed
Sept. 30 in Bryn Mawr while investigating a burglary.
   His trip Wednesday took him to two hotly contested Northeastern
states where Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis are slugging it out
for a combined total of 41 electoral votes.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials said that as Reagan
was en route to New Jersey, Air Force One and a commuter plane may
have flown too close to one another, but the president was in no
danger.
   The president's plane and a Bar Harbour Airlines plane came no
closer than two miles horizontally and 500 feet vertically, but
should have been three miles apart, said FAA spokesman Bob
Buckhorn. The FAA is investigating the incident, he said.
   Telling the Upper Darby students that ``America's prosperity is
both an opportunity and a challenge,'' Reagan said:
   ``I am dedicating myself this year to making sure that this
future of hope built on opportunity and traditional values remains
open to each of you. I believe that the decisions we Americans make
at the polls this year will determine whether or not that future
will be bright.''
   Besides praising Bush, Reagan recognized the vice president's
controversial running mate, Dan Quayle, by quoting his comment in
last week's vice presidential debate that America is ``the envy of
the world.''
   The president also reminded the students that ``when you vote
for a candidate for the Senate or the House, you're voting for the
direction of the country and the world as much as when you vote for
president.''
   ``In the last eight years we have set our sights once again on
the enduring values of family, faith, neighborhood, opportunity,
and freedom,'' the president said.
   ``I believe prosperity and economic growth are the products of
strong values,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bishop in Besieged Town: Pray For Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops and rebels are fighting
house-to-house in the besieged southern Sudan town of Torit and a
Roman Catholic bishop there sent a plea: ``We implore you to pray
for peace,'' a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The English-language newspaper Sudan Times did not say how it
received the written plea from Archbishop Paride Taban. It
published the appeal Wednesday.
   The army meanwhile confirmed reports by the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army that the rebels had captured Ikotos, a town near
Torit. It said soldiers made a ``tactical withdrawal'' from the
town, 45 miles north of Uganda.
   The army claimed its 108-man garrison inflicted many casualties
among more than 3,000 rebels attacking from east, west and north
but gave no figures for either side. The rebels said Friday that 62
soldiers died in the three-day battle and that 300 fled into Uganda.
   The fall of Ikotos gives the rebels control over three towns
that form a triangle around Torit, capital of East Equatoria
province, 85 miles east of Juba, the largest city in the south.
Liberation Army fighters captured Kialla and Katire weeks ago.
   The Sudan Times said street fighting was reported this week in
Torit and that the archbishop has been sending appeals for food and
other relief supplies for the besieged populace.
   ``This is my last message to you,'' Taban's message read,
according to the newspaper. ``We implore you to pray for peace.''
   He said Catholic agencies in his diocese have nothing else to
offer Torit's thousands of hungry people, but the town has given up
on expecting help from the outside, the newspaper reported.
   It quoted the archbishop as saying he told his parishioners
``everybody should decide for himself'' what he should do, and ``we
cannot do more than pray for the will of God for you.''
   The Liberation Army began its rebellion in 1983 in an effort to
win autonomy for the south and now controls 90 percent of the
southern countryside and an increasing number of villages and towns.
   Despite heavy rains in southern Sudan this year, many areas
remain plagued by famine because fighting has forced farmers from
their land.
   Relief operations are hampered because rebels control
checkpoints on many roads, railways and the Nile River and
threatened to shoot at planes flying in the area without rebel
permission.
   Two civilian planes were shot down in 1986-87 with a loss of
more than 70 lives. A relief plane carrying about 100 people was
hit last month as it landed at Juba.

   American and Soviet officials have agreed to
set up a disinformation ``hotline'' to prevent accusations against
each other's countries from escalating into worldwide propaganda
campaigns, Charles Z. Wick, head of the U.S. Information Agency
said Wednesday.
   ``Agreement to work toward the establishment of an `early
warning system''' to challenge disinformation was among the results
of U.S.-Soviet information talks in Moscow Sept. 26-28, said Wick.
   Wick gave few details of the proposed system in a National Press
Club speech but later used the term ``hotline,'' suggesting it
would be a telecommunications link patterned after the 25-year-old
Moscow-Washington ``hotline'' intended to prevent accidental
triggering of a superpower nuclear war.
   The ``early warning system'' would be ``designed to give the
United States a mechanism to challenge disinformation efforts
before they become part of a worldwide campaign,'' Wick said.
   The Russians have ``curtailed dramatically'' circulation of
disinformation, and extreme, false or unsubstantiated charges
against the United States since last December's summit between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said Wick.
   But exceptions continue, he added, recalling an official Moscow
Radio broadcast he heard a few days ago about ``Western countries
buying children from impoverished South American countries and
treating them as slaves.''
   ``I couldn't believe my ears ... we are going to try the hotline
on that one,'' he said.
   Wick said Gorbachev and his supporters ``recognize this kind of
disinformation which was part of the war of ideas a very short time
ago is counterproductive.''
   Soviet agreement for the Voice of America to open a Moscow
bureau was announced after the September talks.
   Wick said other agreements concluded in Moscow included
commercial distribution of Soviet and American films within the two
countries, sale of U.S. newsmagazines for Soviet currency provided
expanded circulation is achieved, cooperation in publishing and
printing and an annual exchange of 1,000 high school students from
each country.
   The two countries also agreed to start talks in January on
setting up cultural centers in each other's territory, Wick said,
terming the agreements ``important first steps in establishing a
freer flow of information and a more constructive relationship.''

<TEXT>
   The best place to live in the United States, in
terms of psychological well-being, is State College, Pa.; the worst
is Reno, Nev., according to a researcher writing in Psychology
Today magazine.
   Robert Levine, a psychologist at California State University in
Fresno, ranked 286 metropolitan areas based on rates of crime,
suicide, alcoholism and divorce rates. His findings were published
in the magazine's November issue.
   Levine said he was surprised that ``the West and South, known
for their mild climates and easy living ranked highest and second
highest respectively on all four types of pathology.''
   He said the 25 best places were: State College; Grand Forks,
N.D.; St. Cloud, Minn.; Rochester, Minn.; McAllen-Pharr-Edinburg,
Texas; Altoona, Pa.; Bloomington, Ind.; Provo-Orem, Utah; Utica,
N.Y.; Akron, Ohio; Sheboygen, Wis.; Lancaster, Pa.;
Paterson-Clifton-Passaic, N.J.; Bismarck, N.D.;
Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, Pa.; Lafayette-West Lafayette, Ind.;
Long Island in New York; Poughkeepsie, N.Y.;
Albany-Schenectady-Troy, N.Y.; Lawrence, Kan.; New Bedford-Fall
River, Mass.; Bloomington-Normal, Ill.; Wheeling, W.Va.;
Cumberland, Md., and Wausau, Wis.
   The 25 worst were: Reno; Las Vegas, Nev.; Miami; Lakeland-Winter
Haven, Fla.; North Little Rock-Little Rock, Ark.; Panama City,
Fla.; Odessa, Texas; Jacksonville, Fla.; San Francisco-Oakland; Los
Angeles-Long Beach; West Palm Beach-Boca Raton, Fla.; Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood, Fla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; Oklahoma City.;
Orlando, Fla.; Sacramento, Calif.; Ocala, Fla.; Bakersfield,
Calif.; Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.; New York; Houston;
Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif.; Stockton, Calif.; Tacoma, Wash.,
and Tucson, Ariz.
   Levine said he decided to develop his own system of rating
cities after a study by a geographer in 1984 found Levine's
hometown of Fresno the ``worst city in America.'' This time Fresno
ranked 232 out of 286.
   The weakness of previous studies was that they ``assume that
people who live under better environmental, economic and cultural
conditions are more satisfied with their lives.''
   Psychologists, he added, though, ``have long recognized that
favorable living conditions don't always produce subjective
well-being.''
   Levine and fellow researchers Kuni Miyake and Marta Lee settled
on rates of alcoholism, suicide, divorce and crime as the
yardsticks to measure by ``because they are both causes and effects
of social stress, clearly an important element in psychological
well-being,'' he said.
   A comparison of the new study with past rankings of the best
places to live found ``virtually no correlation,'' Levine said.
   ``The sharp differences between our rankings and the others
indicate that the objective environmental, economic and cultural
conditions they use as guidelines don't relate very well on
pathology,'' he said. ``When we compared their rankings with the
alcoholism, suicide, divorce and crime rates in each city, the
correlations were very weak.''
   He said the researchers were surprised to learn that higher
suicide and crime rates were associated with milder climates and
healthier economic conditions.
   ``We know that moving to a new area often appeals to people who
are having trouble in their lives and think that a fresh start
somewhere may help them. So they move to a place where conditions
are most attractive, bringing their pathology with them and driving
up the rates of divorce, suicide, alcoholism and crime in these
areas,'' he said.
   Also, sociologists have found that areas where there are many
migrants suffer from social disorganization as the new arrivals
struggle to cope with new situations, new stresses and new social
norms, he said.
   ``We found that the higher migration rates of the Sun Belt areas
of the South and West went with correspondingly higher rates of
alcoholism, suicide, divorce and crime, whether we compared cities
or regions,'' Levine said.

   Paula Ann Moore was shocked and shaken
when two television newscasts carried a report of her death.
   Her photograph appeared on the screen, accompanying a story
about an 18-year-old woman named Paula Ann Moore who had been
killed the previous day.
   ``I was just shocked,'' Ms. Moore said Wednesday. ``I didn't
know what to think. I knew I wasn't dead.''
   The victim, also named Paula Ann Moore, was from Rockford, 18
years old and black.
   Two television stations illustrated the story on Friday with a
ninth-grade school photograph of the other Paula Ann Moore _ also
18, from Rockford, but white and very much alive.
   ``All my friends called and they all thought I was dead,'' Ms.
Moore said. ``They didn't know what to think when I answered the
phone.''
   Both stations ran apologies the next day, last Saturday.
   Ms. Moore said she was satisfied with the apologies and planned
no legal action.
   ``I don't understand how they could do that _ slap anybody's
picture up there, say they were dead,'' she said.
   ``We made a mistake and we did what we could to correct it as
soon as we found out we made a mistake,'' said Arles Hendershott,
news director at WIFR, one of the two stations that used the photo.
   Dennis Horton, news director at WREX, the other station that
used the photo, said the picture was taken from a high school
yearbook _ standard procedure in such cases.
   Horton said the incident would make journalists more careful.

<HEAD>Britain and Vietnam Agree To Repatriate Hong Kong Refugees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Britain and Vietnam agreed Wednesday to repatriate
Vietnamese refugees who want to return home from Hong Kong, with
financial assistance from the British government if needed.
   Britain said about 350 Vietnamese boat people who expressed a
desire to return home will be sent back in a phased program that
will start immediately.
   The agreement was announced at the end of a second round of
talks between a joint British-Hong Kong delegation and a Vietnamese
delegation led by the assistant foreign minister, Vu Khoan.
   The accord says both sides accept ``the need for comprehensive
arrangements'' for Vietnamese boat people who arrived in Hong Kong
after June 16, when the British colony moved to curb a steep rise
in refugees by ending its open door policy.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, who by custom was not identified,
said the 9,500 Vietnamese refugees in question are classified as
illegal immigrants and will remain in detention centers pending
outcome of further talks with Vietnam.
   Forcible repatriation of refugees who do not want to return home
has not been discussed with the Vietnamese, he said, adding:
   ``We will concentrate on the first 350. We hope others will come
forward and realize that their future is in Vietnam.''
   Vu said the returning refugees would be received in a
``humanitarian way.''
   Under Hong Kong policy now in effect, Vietnamese who cannot
prove they are fleeing political persecution are labeled illegal
immigrants subject to repatriation. Hong Kong holds that most are
actually economic migrants.
   The total number of Vietnamese boat people now in camps there is
25,000.
   Two weeks ago, Hong Kong began broadcasts aiming at Vietnam
explaining the new tough policy in a move to discourage Vietnamese
from heading there.
   The delegations also called on other countries to increase their
efforts to accept Vietnamese eligible for resettlement from Hong
Kong.
   They invited the U.N. High Commission for Refugees to take part
in putting into effect the accord to repatriate those Vietnamese
who want to return home.

<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of senators working on the
$2.6 billion election-year drug bill agreed late Wednesday on a
formula for paring down the more than 100 amendments to the
catchall measure.
   Under the procedure, about 56 of the amendments would either be
folded into the bill, offered as amendments or killed by the
chamber's leaders. The remaining amendments would not be offered at
all.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said the Senate
would vote Thursday on whether to follow the proposed formula and
begin debating the bill.
   Byrd said that if lawmakers agreed to follow the procedure, the
Senate could complete work on the bill by Friday. Congressional
leaders have been hoping that the House and Senate could adjourn
for the year by Friday.
   Byrd said that if the procedure for considering the amendments
was not adopted, ``It may mean we'll have no drug bill.''
   The majority leader said the drug bill would be amended to
include provisions giving prosecutors tougher powers to crack down
on child pornography, creating a new position of federal ``drug
czar,'' and stiffening sentences for some drug offenses.
   The agreement would allow votes on about eight other amendments,
including language stripping a provision establishing the death
penalty for certain drug offenders who commit murder, requiring
states to randomly test new drivers license applicants, and
allowing some drug offenders to lose federal benefits they might
receive.
   Byrd took to the Senate floor Wednesday morning to urge his
colleagues to refrain from offering amendments ``trying to indicate
who can be the toughest, who can be the John Wayne in the drug war.
   ``We can all be tough, but we've got a good tough bill,'' he
said.
   But some lawmakers were holding out for guarantees that votes
would be allowed on their own amendments. Included among them were
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who was insisting on votes on proposals
to toughen sentences for drug offenders convicted of dealing with
children, and to deny many federal benefits to some people found
guilty of drug sales.
   ``I'm going to offer those two amendments if I'm here and
alive,'' Gramm said before entering one of the day's negotiating
sessions.
   The focus of much of Wednesday's discussion was an amendment by
Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., to limit appeals by convicted
criminals who claim procedural errors in their trials. By late
Wednesday, lawmakers thought a compromise might involve delaying a
final decision until after a commission appointed by Supreme Court
Chief Justice William Rehnquist presents its findings next year.
   Another controversial proposal, also advanced by Thurmond, would
allow some illegally obtained evidence seized in good faith by
police officers to be admitted in court. Lawmakers said a possible
compromise would involve writing into law the language from a 1984
Supreme Court decision that allowed the use of evidence seized by
police armed with a defective court warrant.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh came to the Capitol to urge
Senate Republicans to seek a bill resembling a tough version passed
last month by the House. That legislation included the death
penalty and many other provisions stiffening penalties and
increasing the anti-drug powers of the authorities.
   Lawmakers also had to decide how to deal with other amendments
that have nothing to do with illicit drugs. These proposals,
written by senators realizing that the drug bill could be the last
one to pass Congress this year, included language requiring warning
labels on alcoholic beverage containers and imposing sanctions on
South Africa.
   One thing the legislation lacked was a way to pay for itself.
Lawmakers say $1.4 billion of the bill's pricetag would be spent in
1989, but concede that the government can currently only scrape
together no more than $450 million to pay for it. The Senate has so
far voted down efforts to raise taxes or slash other spending to
provide the money.
   Even if the Senate should approve a bill, House-Senate
negotiators would have to agree to an identical version of the
legislation before it could be sent to President Reagan for his
signature.

   Indian demonstrators who say the discovery of
America led only to slavery and impoverishment broke up a Columbus
Day celebration Wednesday, and 12 people were reported injured in
the resulting street brawl.
   ``Long live Cuauhtemoc!'' demonstrators shouted, referring to
the last Aztec emperor of Mexico, who battled in vain against the
Spanish Conquest. ``Death to Columbus!''
   The Excelsior news service said several women, one police
officer and a boy were among those hurt in a brawl between
demonstrators and ceremony organizers.
   No arrests were reported during the ceremony to honor
Christopher Columbus, who came upon the New World on Oct. 12, 1492
while in search of the Orient.
   The demonstrators were led by a group calling itself the
Confederation of Indigenous Peoples and included residents of Lomas
de Seminario, an area in south Mexico City taken over by squatters
in recent years.
   Some threw sticks and rocks at ceremony organizers. Several
gardeners working nearby joined in and began throwing clods of dirt.
   The demonstrators ripped down flower arrangements in front of a
statue of Columbus and interrupted singing of the Mexican national
anthem and Columbus Day speeches during the short-lived ceremony
attended by about 300 people.
   Another Indian group, the Center of Pre-American Culture,
demonstrated peacefully on Tuesday in the Zocalo, a downtown plaza.
The coalition of 52 organizations held a celebration of Indian
dances, music, art and poetry in asking for abolition of Columbus
Day as a holiday.
   Excelsior quoted Center president Miguel Angel Mendoza as saying
Tuesday that Columbus' arrival ``began the enslavement, the
destruction of our ancient cultures and the stealing of our riches,
something that hasn't stopped in 500 years.''
   ``What the whites want to believe is that Indian children aren't
born in our country anymore,'' Mendoza said.

   A federal judge and lawyers began the tedious
process on Wednesday of whittling down a list of more than 100
prospective jurors for the trial of two Teamsters officials on
racketeering and embezzlement charges.
   The process of finding a panel of 12 will last at least through
Friday and possibly into next week.
   Harold Friedman, 66, is charged with two counts of labor
racketeering, two of embezzlement and two of making false
statements to the Labor Department. Prosecutors contend the alleged
$700,000 embezzlement scheme was masterminded by the late Jackie
Presser.
   Friedman is president of the 5,000-member Teamsters Local 507,
an international vice president of the union since 1983, president
of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters and president of Teamsters
Joint Council 41 in northeast Ohio. He also is president of Bakery
Workers Local 19 in Cleveland.
   Co-defendant Anthony Hughes, 52, Local 507's recording
secretary, is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and one
count of embezzlement.
   Until recently, both Friedman and Hughes were overshadowed by
the defense of Presser, Teamsters president from 1983 until he died
of brain cancer on July 9. Presser also was indicted on charges of
labor racketeering and embezzlement.
   Questionnaires were handed out to some 125 prospective jurors on
Oct. 3 to save lawyers time in the interrogation process. District
Judge George W. White presided over the start of jury selection.
   About 25 possible jurors indicated the expected length of the
trial, from six to eight weeks, would cause them personal problems
and most were dismissed. Another three were dismissed after
claiming to know one of the defendants.
   With 86 possible jurors then packing the courtroom, White asked
if any of them would be unable to ignore pre-trial publicity
surrounding the case. None responded.
   Federal prosecutors have alleged Presser, as secretary-treasurer
of Local 507, masterminded the alleged $700,000 embezzlement scheme.
   The trial culminates a federal probe that came to light on Oct.
8, 1982, when federal marshals and agents of the Department of
Labor inspector general's office seized records at Local 507.
   The Justice Department hopes to prove that Friedman and Hughes
helped place on the payroll of Local 507 three people who received
money but did no union work and benefitted personally by doing so.
   Presser and Hughes have been identified in pre-trial documents
as FBI informants who would provide their FBI ``handlers'' with
information about organized crime and Teamsters inner-politics.
Friedman apparently had no such FBI link, and court documents are
unclear whether he knew anything about the others' FBI connection.

   Real estate mogul Donald Trump announced
Wednesday he has agreed to buy Eastern Airlines' profitable
Northeast air shuttle for $365 million in cash and will rename it
after himself.
   ``I want to run it as a diamond, an absolute diamond,'' Trump
proclaimed to reporters at a news conference with Texas Air Corp.
Chairman Frank Lorenzo at the Plaza Hotel in New York, another
recent Trump acquisition.
   He said the three-city service would be renamed ``The Trump
Shuttle'' and its blue-silver Boeing 727s would be redecorated and
emblazoned with red, black and gold stripes.
   The deal is expected to be completed by mid-December, if it
survives government scrutiny and a legal attack by Eastern's
unions, who said the sale would be the death of the airline and
vowed a fight to overturn the deal.
   The announcement followed a week of speculation about the
billionaire developer's interest in buying the shuttle from ailing
Eastern, which is a major subsidiary of Texas Air.
   The price was well above previous estimates of what Trump would
pay.
   ``It's top dollar,'' said Robert Joedicke, an airline analyst
for the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Many analysts and other observers had estimated that the shuttle
_ which serves New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., and is the
most profitable of Eastern's operations _ could fetch $200 million
to $300 million. Texas Air had tried earlier this year to transfer
the shuttle operation from Eastern to a new subsidiary for $225
million, but Eastern unions blocked that attempt.
   Standard & Poor's Corp., in announcing that it was keeping a
close eye on Eastern in the wake of the shuttle sale, said $365
million was ``a generous price.'' The interest on that sum could
recover more than half the cash flow that would be lost by selling
the shuttle, the credit-rating agency said.
   For the image-conscious Trump, the purchase could be viewed more
as a way to enhance his prestige and influence than a straight
business deal.
   Earlier this year, Trump bought the legendary Plaza Hotel for
$400 million following a heated battle with other suitors. Trump
has admitted that he was ``in love'' with the hotel for more than a
decade and ``tore himself up'' to get it.
   But there also could be compelling business logic behind Trump's
latest acquisition. Many analysts said Trump might use the shuttle
to help draw people to his hotel and casino properties in Atlantic
City, N.J., on the weekends.
   ``It's something that we're looking at,'' Trump said.
   Trump now operates a helicopter service from New York to
Atlantic City. The resort city's Bader Field is too small to handle
the Boeing 727s operated by the shuttle, but the Atlantic City
Airport 10 miles from the city can accommodate them.
   Trump noted a report that he intended to sell the land earmarked
for a huge commercial development in Manhattan to help finance the
shuttle deal, but he did not directly address its accuracy. No
interested party could afford to pay him what the 100-acre site is
worth, he joked to reporters.
   Trump and Lorenzo said the shuttle would maintain fares
competitive with the shuttle service of Pan Am Corp. and would not
lay off any employees. The $365 million includes landing rights at
airports in the three shuttle cities plus 17 planes.
   Pan Am said it welcomed Trump into the shuttle market. Pan Am
claims its share of that market has jumped from around 24 percent
in October 1986 to roughly 45 percent.
   Eastern said the airline's shuttle service had net income of
around $16.8 million in 1987 on revenue of $40.3 million, down from
a 1985 profit of $28.2 million on revenue of $49.2 million,
according to spokesman Robin Matell. Pan Am has not disclosed
earnings from its shuttle operations.
   The shuttle deal marks another tumultuous chapter in the saga of
Eastern, the Miami-based carrier that has been scarred by
management-labor feuding and $1 billion in losses over the past
decade.

   A deaf former church janitor pleaded guilty
Wednesday to charges of kidnapping and molesting two girls, keeping
one in a dirt crawl space under the church's altar for as long as
six weeks.
   Kenneth Alvin Michel, 32, entered the plea to two counts of
kidnapping, one count of attempted kidnapping and seven counts of
child molestation, said prosecutor Ken Peterson. Michel uses sign
language and head nods to speak through an interpreter.
   Prosecutors filed an amended complaint that dropped another
molestation charge, Peterson said.
   ``He freely admitted molesting both children but would not admit
to one particular molest on (one of the girls),'' Peterson said,
explaining why prosecutors decided to drop one count.
   Michel was accused of kidnapping 4-year-old Candi Talarico on
June 4 as she played with friends outside her downtown apartment.
Her disappearance drew national television attention.
   Six weeks later, Michel attempted to kidnap a 6-year-old girl in
suburban Elk Grove and then kidnapped a 5-year-old girl, Muey Han
Saefong, outside her downtown Sacramento apartment.
   A passing motorist saw the attempted kidnapping and followed
Michel's car and got his license number. Police used the number to
trace Michel to the United Methodist Church in Elk Grove.
   Officers found Saefong tied and gagged in the back of Michel's
car. They found Talarico in the church, in a 7-by-9-by-3-foot space
under the floor.
   The space was furnished with blankets, stuffed animals, books,
food, lights, a television, and newspapers that contained articles
about the kidnapping, which was featured on Fox Broadcasting Co.'s
``America's Most Wanted.''
   Michel faces up to 62 years in prison. Sentencing was scheduled
for Dec. 7.

   A demonstration that temporarily closed Food
and Drug Administration headquarters underscores the desperation of
AIDS sufferers hoping for a chemical cure that so far has escaped
researchers around the world.
   The action Tuesday at FDA's headquarters building in nearby
Rockville, Md., also highlighted a fundamental problem facing the
agency charged by law with overseeing the safety and effectiveness
of its drugs.
   In essence, the hundreds of demonstrators _ including more than
100 arrested for blocking entrances to the building _ are asking
the agency to recommend experimental AIDS treatments as soon as it
determines they are no more dangerous than AIDS itself.
   The agency says that to do that would eliminate a major reason
for its existence: to apply a scientific sorting process that tries
to cull quackery from treatments proven safe and effective.

   The government will not be able to manufacture
nuclear weapons materials for 2{ months, but it says that raises no
threat to national security.
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said Tuesday that his
department, which had planned to restart one of its three nuclear
weapons reactors at the Savannah River Plant as early as November,
now does not expect the first of them to reach full operation until
January.
   All three of the reactors, which began operation in 1954, have
been closed down for maintenance and safety checks amid a wave of
publicity about lax safety precautions.
   The department, said Herrington, ``will not operate unsafe
reactors. We will meet the defense needs of this country in a safe
manner and an environmentally sensitive manner.''

   Federal agents gave new meaning to ``hostile
takeover'' by smashing a $32 million global money-laundering ring
that routed drug profits through a bank to Colombian cocaine
cartels, authorities say.
   Customs agents infiltrated Colombia money-laundering syndicates
and helped smuggle profits from drug sales out of the country,
federal authorities charged Tuesday in a series of indictments
naming 85 defendants.
   The charges resulted from a two-year investigation dubbed
``Operation C Chase.'' The ``C'' stands for C-note, slang for $100

   Among the defendants were BCCI Holdings, a Luxembourg-based bank
holding company with branches in 72 countries, and nine bank

   Negotiators are trying to reach a compromise
on sharply differing tax bills passed by the House and Senate, one
containing a ``taxpayers' bill of rights'' and the other offering
relief for 20 million owners of mutual funds.
   The Senate bill, which was approved Tuesday night on an 87-1
vote, would cut selected taxes by an estimated $3 billion over
three years and, to avoid worsening the deficit, boost other taxes
by the same amount. The House bill, passed 380-25 on Aug. 4, has a
$7.5 billion price tag.
   Far more provisions are identical in both bills. Both would
correct hundreds of technical errors in the 1986 tax overhaul;
extend several expiring tax benefits; relieve farmers from paying
the federal diesel tax on fuel for off-road use, and raise some
taxes to pay for the benefits.
   The tax bill and a comprehensive plan for fighting drug abuse
are the only major pieces of legislation standing in the way of
adjournment of the 100th Congress, as early as this weekend.

   The Communist leadership has
undergone a major shake-up that will most probably slow down the
pace of reform in Czechoslovakia, speeches by senior officials
indicate.
   During the reshuffle, which occurred Monday and Tuesday, the
country lost its key advocate of speedy economic and social reform,
longtime Premier Lubomir Strougal.
   Warning of the potential for high inflation and unemployment
under rapid reform, the leadership backed personnel changes aimed
at pursuing a slower road to ``restructuring'' than that of the

   Pope John Paul II concluded his final foreign trip
of the year with an appeal to Europe to reject a secular future and
look to its common religious heritage to guide it into the 21st
century.
   John Paul, who completes a decade as pope this week, devoted the
four-day trip in northeastern France to spreading his vision of a
unified Europe and shoring up the wilting Roman Catholic Church on
the continent where it first flowered.
   The pope got a sharp reminder of the divisions still plaguing
European countries as he gave a speech Tuesday to the European
Parliament, his main address of the trip.
   Shortly after he began speaking to the packed chamber, a
militant Northern Ireland Protestant leader, the Rev. Ian Paisley,
leapt to his feet and shouted, ``I renounce you! I renounce you as
the anti-Christ!''

<HEAD>After Years of Squabbling, The Guccis Leave Gucging that his father,

<TEXT>
   United States. The suit was dismissed, but the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service picked up on the documents and in January 1986,
Aldo pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in a federal court in
New York City. He was sentenced to a year in prison but was allowed
to serve part of his sentence at a halfway house in West Palm
Beach, Fla.
   Gucci relatives were aghast at the war threatening to tear apart
the family and the firm it had built.
   ``The company was a part of my life,'' says Giorgio, Paolo's
older brother. ``I had always smelled the perfume of leather, had
always watched my grandfather in the shop in Florence, working with
so much energy.''
   In 1984, Maurizio used his 50 percent of the company to seize
control and oust Aldo. The young, bespectacled Maurizio brought in
a new team of managers.
   ``The board decided the company had to be professionally
managed,'' explains Cucchiani, one of the young, American-educated
executives.
   But older family members saw it differently.
   ``Maurizio wanted to overcome the idea of a family firm,'' says
his cousin Giorgio.
   Peace did not reign for long. Maurizio's relatives alleged that
the papers giving him half the company on his father's death in
1983 had forged signatures. Maurizio's shares were frozen.
   Based on his relatives charges, courts in Florence and Milan
charged Maurizio with exporting capital and evading taxes. An
arrest warrant was issued and Maurizio took refuge in Switzerland.
   To replace him, state-appointed custodians of his shares
appointed a Milan business professor, Maria Martellini.
   ``A new era has begun,'' Martellini says. ``The company has a
place in the market that is more important than the specific
problems of the Gucci family.''
   Under its new management, the company has launched a program to
expand production, standardize the quality of its stores and trim
its product line, which had expanded beyond leather goods to
100,000 items.
   Sales increased by nearly 4 percent, from 229.7 billion lire in
1986 to 238 billion lire in 1987 _ about $170 million at current
exchange rates.
   Guccio Gucci's linked initials still adorn the firm's handbags,
luggage and scarves. And in workshops in Florence, apron-clad
artisans cut black and cobalt-blue alligator skins and guide
handbags through sewing machines.
   But the Guccis are nearly gone rom Gucci.
   Last spring, Giorgio and his brothers Roberto and Paolo decided
to sell most of their shares in the company. The purchaser was
Investcorp, an Arab investment bank.
   While a judge ruled in July that 40-year-old Maurizio could
return to Italy, his shares are frozen. If he loses his court
cases, he may have to sell some.
   Giorgio says he parted with his shares because the new
management was not interested in his ideas and the traditional
standards.
   The new managers, however, insist the company will continue to
reflect the vision of Guccio Gucci.
   ``There is a tremendous strength that goes beyond the fights and
feuds,'' says Cucchiani. ``The strength is the consumer who wants
this brand. The strength is also with the people who work with the
company that want the Gucci splendor, and the artisans that want
that splendor.
   ``The name has got a magic connotation.''

   Something special happened when the widower and
the divorcee, each 60 years of age, struck up a conversation while
they waited in a supermarket checkout line.
   Before long, they were getting together regularly for dinners,
movies and trips to the local museum.
   They had many shared interests. Their children were grown and
well established with families of their own.
   Neither of them was rich, but both owned homes that had
appreciated greatly in value since they had bought them many years
before.
   So after the joyous day of their wedding, they were able to sell
those houses, buy a comfortable condominium and put the rest of the
proceeds in income-producing investments.
   What possibly could be wrong with a happy tale like this? Well,
not much maybe, but it would have been even better if the sequence
of events had been altered just a bit.
   The couple needlessly forfeited about $35,000 that could have
paid for, say, a long honeymoon cruise.
   If they had checked with a good financial adviser, they would
have sold their houses first and gotten married afterward.
   That way, say experts on the subject, each could have claimed a
tax break sheltering $125,000 of the profits from the sale of their
houses. Once they were married, they could claim that exemption
only once.
   The $125,000 exemption was written into the tax laws with an
intent that is readily apparent _ to make it more practicable for
people 55 years of age or older to help finance their later years
with proceeds from the sale of a home.
   But the rules had to be framed so that people weren't encouraged
to go into the property-flipping business on their 55th birthdays,
cashing in on the tax break over and over again.
   Thus was it decreed that the exclusion could be taken only once
in an individual's, or a couple's, lifetime.
   ``Both spouses are ineligible for the exclusion if either of
them previously claimed it,'' points out the accounting firm of
KMPG Peat Marwick.
   ``Only one exclusion is allowed per couple. Therefore, even if
the exclusion was not claimed previously, a married couple cannot
claim exclusions for two homes.
   ``Couples who are planning to be married and who both wish to
take advantage of the exclusion should sell their residences prior
to the marriage.''
   In some Internal Revenue Service publications, says William
Brennan, an adviser on tax and investment planning, the agency says
the couple in our story, having sold both houses before taking
their nuptial vows, might still run into a snag if they filed a
joint tax return.
   As a married couple, the IRS material says, they are entitled to
just one exemption.
   But a memo issued last spring ``concludes that the critical time
for determining the existence of a marriage is on the date the
houses were sold,'' Brennan observes.
   ``If they were sold before the marriage, each is entitled to a
$125,000 exclusion _ filing a joint return has no impact.''
   There are some other fine points about the $125,000 exclusion
that are noteworthy for anyone using a house as a building block in
a retirement savings plan.
   For one thing, points out the accounting firm of Deloitte
Haskins & Sells, you must have owned, and lived in, the home for at
least three of the five years preceding the sale to claim the
exemption.
   Also, you could conceivably find yourself in a situation where
you might think about passing up the exclusion to save it for use
on some future home sale.
   Says Deloitte Haskins & Sells, ``since this is a one-time
exclusion, you should consider carefully the time you decide to use
it.''

   Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon recently
celebrated the 26th anniversary of ``The Tonight Show,'' but their
association goes back four more years.
   It was 30 years ago when they started working together, when
Carson was host of a game show called ``Who Do You Trust?'' and
McMahon was hired to be the announcer.
   ``Our relationship was established the very first day,'' McMahon
recalled. ``I introduced the show, then I brought him the list of
questions. He jumped and said, `Lothar, you startled me!'
   Lothar was the faithful sidekick to ``Mandrake the Magician'' in
the newspaper comic strip. When Mandrake's magic wasn't enough,
Lothar supplied the muscle.
   ``That set our relationship. Lots of humor and kidding. A lot of
playing on my size, being a happy-go-lucky Irishman. All the things
we've done on `The Tonight Show' were set up and tested on `Who Do
You Trust?'
   ``Johnny's the boss,'' said McMahon. ``You have to remember
that, but I get my two cents' worth in there. His many marriages _
it's always good for a joke. His wealth and his passion for
privacy. Actually, Johnny kids himself. He'll say, `Somebody came
to see me, but they got wet when they fell into the moat.'''
   Their association has lasted longer than any of Carson's
marriages.
   ``We've never had a disagreement, never had a problem,'' said
McMahon. ``I think we have a mutual respect for each other. I
respect his being the boss. I respect his privacy. We like each
other.''
   It was Dick Clark who brought them together, and many years
later, McMahon and Clark teamed up for NBC's ``Bloopers and
Practical Jokes,'' which they still do occasionally as a special.
   ``Dick was my next-door neighbor in Philadelphia,'' McMahon
recalled. ``One day Edward R. Murrow interviewed Dick on the CBS
show `Person to Person.' He had a party, and I entertained. Dick's
producer told me I was pretty good. The producer's office was in
New York in the next office to Johnny's at the Little Theater. When
he heard they were looking for an announcer he suggested me.''
   McMahon took the train to New York and met with Carson. ``He
asked me a few questions and we stood by the window and watched
them put up a sign at the Shubert Theater across the street,'' he
said. ``It was for Judy Holliday in `Bells are Ringing.'
   ``Johnny said thank you, and I left figuring I didn't get the
job. Two weeks later the producer called me and said, `Look, when
you start Monday, wear a suit. Johnny likes to wear sports
clothes.' I said I didn't know what he was talking about. He said,
`Didn't anybody tell you? You got the job.'''
   Prior to becoming Carson's inseparable sidekick, McMahon worked
as an announcer in Philadelphia. He had been host of ``Bride and
Groom'' for six weeks and done a few commercials. Since then, of
course, he has become one of the most active personalities in
commercials. He is also the host of the syndicated talent show
``Star Search.''
   One of his commercial accounts is American Family Publishers,
which mails millions of sweepstakes entries every year. Hallmark is
bringing out a new card which says, ``Why don't I hear from you
anymore?'' Open the card and it says, ``Ed McMahon has time to
write to me.''
   His daughter, Katherine Mary, got a sweepstakes entry when she
was 6 months old.
   McMahon and his wife, Victoria, adopted Katherine Mary nearly
three years ago. He has four grown children.
   In World War II he was a Marine fighter pilot, teaching carrier
landings at Green Cove Springs, Fla. He got his orders to join an
all-Marine group on an aircraft carrier on the day Japan
surrendered.
   He was called back into the Marines in the Korean War and flew
an L19 as an artillery spotter. He recently retired from the Marine
Corps Reserve as a colonel.
   Despite his Irish ancestry, McMahon claims descent from a former
premier of France. He says an ancestor was a general in Napoleon's
army and briefly premier in the days when the Irish frequently
joined the French to fight the English. He has a picture of himself
and his wife standing by the street sign for McMahon Boulevard, one
of the streets radiating from the Arch of Triumph in Paris.

   Teamwork is fast outpacing individual effort
in the corporate world, and forward-looking companies are
encouraging employee unity through new means that often include an
unorthodox business concept: fun.
   While the company picnic and Christmas party still rank among
the most popular extracurricular activities, some companies are
relying on more creative means to break down corporate hierarchies
and build up team spirit.
   ``Having fun is absolutely critical because it energizes
people,'' said Eric Flamholtz, professor of human resources at the
graduate school of management at the University of California, Los
Angeles. ``But, you want to simultaneously develop new skills and
insights that can be applied in a practical sense to make the
organization more effective.''
   Take an all-day seminar for about 70 executives, sales managers
and support staff at a Los Angeles sales division of AT&T
Communications.
   Following lunch, guest speaker Nigel Livingwage approached the
dais, introduced himself as an expert in computer accessing, took a
sip of coffee and dropped ``dead.''
   Livingwage, also known as Buzz Noe, is an actor and partner in
Capers, a company that plans murder mysteries, these days almost
exclusively for corporate clients, including Pacific Bell, Blue
Cross and Honeywell.
   The AT&T employees had been given subtle clues throughout the
morning that something was amiss: a shifty waiter who never set
down a coffee pot, an appearance by an eccentric British mystery
writer (played by Noe's wife and partner Lynn Chaplin) and a
Japanese businessman, who was really a Caucasian actor wearing
make-up.
   ``Mr. Moto (the Japanese character) was so convincing despite
his phony appearance that three AT&T employees approached him
trying to sell him some telecommunications services,'' Noe said.
   Entertainment aside, the amateur sleuthhounds, now divided into
six teams, got down to the issue at hand: Who killed the speaker
and why?
   After a while, questionnaires were handed out to be answered by
the employees individually. Identical forms were then handed to
each team to be answered as a whole.
   The Capers staff then graded the surveys and plotted statistics
comparing the individual scores to the team scores.
   ``The whole idea is that the group should do as well if not
better than the individuals,'' Ms. Chaplin said. ``If that wasn't
the case, it became clear that they didn't pool their resources or
depend on the person who had the most correct answers.''
   The exercise, Ms. Chaplin said, allows the teamwork concept to
get out of the corporate environment and forces people who do not
normally interact to communicate with each other.
   ``It puts everyone on the same level,'' she said. ``It gives the
big guy the opportunity to see that he always has something to
learn from his support staff.''
   But such games are not without their critics.
   ``It's gimmicky,'' said Robert O. Metzger, adjunct professor at
the University of Southern California, and director of the campus's
Center for Operations Management.
   ``It's playing to management's natural desire to simple, quick
solutions to what in effect are very complex and involved
management issues,'' he said.
   ``When you look at some of the efforts that have gone into
improved teamwork, you find that Ford Motor Co. spent eight years
and several million dollars before employees felt they would not be
risking their jobs if they stopped the assembly line because of
what they believed was a problem in quality control,'' Metzger said.
   Flamholtz, the UCLA professor, agreed.
   ``Teambuilding activities that most closely resemble everyday
working situations are always more effective than those that

   But AT&T branch manager Dennis Kruse, who organized the murder
mystery event, said his goal was not to solve his division's
management problems.
   ``It certainly helped to break down barriers,'' Kruse said.
``That's the first step.
   ``If it's fine tuning you're looking for, of course, you'll need
more time and a more structured format.''

<HEAD>U.S. Election of Woman Bishop Shakes Anglican Communion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Election of the first woman bishop in the
historic apostolic succession rankled some sectors in that
tradition, but safeguards had been erected in advance to cushion
the shock.
   These aimed, both in the U.S. Episcopal Church in which the
election occurred and in the world-wide Anglican Communion of which
the U. S. church is a part, to stave off ruptures as a result.
   The event, nevertheless, heightened strains on the issue both
domestically and internationally in that 70-million-member
household of faith, and frayed unity talks with Roman Catholicism
and Eastern Orthodoxy.
   They also, along with Anglicans, claim a succession of bishops
traced back to the time of Jesus's apostles and passed on by that
lineage, but without women in it.
   Other churches, including some Protestant bodies with bishops, a
few women among them, don't maintain that ancient succession.
   The first woman chosen for it, the Rev. Barbara C. Harris, 58,
of Philadelphia, was elected Sept. 24 by a convention in Boston of
the Episcopal diocese of Massacusetts, as suffragan (assistant)
bishop.
   ``For many it is the occasion of great joy and celebration,''
said Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning of New York.
``For many it is a troubling time'' that `` will test our
commitment to the unity of the church.''
   It sent tremors through the Anglican world, already in turmoil
over the lesser ordination of women clergy in a half dozen of its
28 national branches, including the U.S. Episcopal Church, and
ruffled some ecumenical counterparts.
   Roman Catholic Archbishop John F. Whealon of Hartford, Conn.,
co-chairman of U. S. Anglican-Roman Catholic talks, called the
action a ``major setback'' to sought-for unity. Similar Roman
reactions came on the international level.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, leader of the world's
Anglicans, said in London said the event would have ``far-reaching
consequences,'' and he pledged to uphold unity ``as we begin to
work out the implications.''
   Rumblings of dissent also arose, both domestically and
internationally. The Rev. Jerome Polititzer, presdident of the
Prayer Book Society of the Episcopal Church, said its survey of lay
members show a majority oppose women bishops.
   In London, the Church of England's Bishop Graham Leonard, a
leading opponent of women priests, said the event will cause deep
divisions.
   ``In common with many other bishops, I would be unable to
recognize a woman bishop or the validity of any ordinations or
confirmations performed by her,'' he said.
   A few U.S. Episcopal bishops also hold this view, and so far
have declined to recognize even women clergy, although they were
authorized by the whole church's convention in 1976, and about
1,200 women have been ordained.
   Despite continuing tensions over it, both the 2.7-million-member
U. S. church and Anglicans internationally have taken steps for
living with the differences without breakaing up.
   With the posibility of a woman bishop being elected in mind, the
Lambeth Conference, a once-in-l0-years world assembly of Anglicana
bishop, in August approved what was called ``the great compromise.''
   Passed by an an overwhelming majority of 423 to 28, the bishops
of the 28 branches, including both proponents and opponents of
female clergy, upheld the right of each branch to decide for itself
whether to consecrate women bishops.
   The measure calls for mutual respect between branches which
disagree on the issue, and exercise of courtesy between bishops of
differing opinions. Conference resolution are not binding, but
carry much weight among members.
   An international commission was authorized to work out means to
hold the communion together once a woman was conscrated a bishop,
and Anglican Archbishop Robert Eames of Ireland was named to head
the seven-member body.
   Runcie said, ``The spirit of the Lambeth Conference has given
all the bishops _ including those against the ordination of women _
the inspiration to maintain the highest possible degree of unity
with those who differ.''
   In a similar backstop measure in the United States, the
Episcopal Church's governing convention last July in Detroit
approved a scheme whereby any congregation rejecting a woman bishop
could petition for a male ``Episcopal Visitor'' bishop to
administer confirmations.
   But the woman bishop still would make the periodic pastoral
visits required by church law, even to congregations rejecting
women bishops.
   The election of Bishop-elect Harris, 58, still remains subject
to ratification by a majority of the church's bishops and 118
diocesan standing committees. But there was no indication it would
be widely challenged.
   Her consecration and installation is expected to be early next
year in Boston.
   Meanwhile, another woman, the Rev. Margo Elaine Maris of
Minneapolis, was among nominees for suffragan bishop of Minnesota
in an election scheduled Oct. 29.

   Although some people nowadays consider
religion irrelevant to politics, democratic values are rooted in
religion, says the head of the Knights of Columbus.
   Virgil C. Dechant, in his annual Columbus Day message, said that
``over the long pull, democratic government depends for its health
and perhaps its very survival upon values and beliefs which come
from religion.''
   Central to the Judeo-Christian belief, he said, is ``an abiding
belief in the dignity of the individual human person... God made us

   Oscar Arias Sanchez was making a big mistake in
his 1986 campaign for the presidency of Costa Rica, said his
campaign manager from the United States.
   Play down domestic economic issues, New Yorker Joe Napolitan
urged Arias. Instead, emphasize the need for peace in Central
America.
   Arias turned around his losing campaign, won the election and
went on to father a Central American peace plan that won him the
1987 Nobel Peace Prize.
   The election was one more victory for the peripatetic Americans
who are finding more and more work these days as advisers to
foreign political campaigns.
   For 20 years, Americans have traveled the world to help
candidates in both fledgling and longstanding democracies decide
which issues are the key to success in their races. They also tutor
them in the latest U.S. electioneering techniques and technology.
   Sensitive to any suggestion that they change the nature of the
political systems they intervene in, U.S. campaign firms and
advisers keep a low profile. But Americans have been deeply
involved in national elections in more than 30 nations, including
Australia, Canada, Panama, Spain, Britain, France, Ireland,
Nigeria, Mexico, the Philippines, Japan and Greece.
   In Israel, with a presidential election scheduled for Nov. 1,
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres is getting presidential campaign
advice from David Sawyer of the Sawyer-Miller Group, based in New
York.
   Sawyer's firm also advised members of the opposition in Chile,
where a well-organized campaign against the president, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, resulted this month in voters rejecting his bid for
another term.
   While the Americans claim credit for electing their clients,
most of them strenuously deny having any influence in the
subsequent policy of the government.
   The theme of a campaign, however, invariably determines the
public's expectations of the winner's policy.
   ``I think it's the same as in America,'' acknowledged Joe
Cerrell, president of the International Association of Political
Consultants. ``I don't see much difference. They can impact policy;
they can change governments.''
   Some might think Americans in foreign campaigns would be
controversial, with opposition candidates claiming U.S.
manipulation. There's good reason why that rarely happens.
   ``All the sides use them, so it would be the pot calling the
kettle black,'' said Larry Sabato, a professor of political science
at the University of Virginia. For instance, both Corazon Aquino
and Ferdinand Marcos had U.S. advisers in their presidential
election.
   ``Actually, to people assessing whether to take us or not, it
doesn't appear to be a question of `Are we compromising on our
values by taking in outsiders?''' said Mark Malloch-Brown, a
British adviser from Sawyer-Miller, who advised Mrs. Aquino in her
1984-85 presidential campaign.
   ``The way they see it is, `If we bring in state-of-the-art
techniques, is there a way we can win this election more
effectively, more honestly?'''
   Cerrell agreed that Arias' campaign on the Central American
peace issue was a prime example of a campaign strategy that had
far-reaching implications long after the election.
   Oddly enough, Arias was opposed to that campaign strategy,
Napolitan recalls.
   ``His argument was that everybody's in favor of peace; nobody is
in favor of war,'' Napolitan said.
   ``We agreed with that, but pointed out that the more he started
talking about peace, the more he would become identified as the
peace candidate. And that's what happened, and to his credit he
carried through after the election by coming out with his peace
plan.''
   Advisers are evasive about how much they earn. They say it is a
business secret and that their charges vary widely, depending on
the length of a campaign and what services a client needs.
   Published estimates of charges suggest a national campaign by a
top U.S. adviser costs about $150,000 for the basic consultant's
fee, with expenses tripling the bill.
   Sawyer said his firm advises some candidates, such as Mrs.
Aquino, for free.
   Sawyer-Miller maintains contracts with some clients even after
the election.
   ``To keep a high enough level of mobilization and enthusiasm for
the (political) goals you're trying to achieve,'' said
Malloch-Brown, ``requires a constant political campaign-type
dialogue with the population.''
   Napolitan has longstanding contracts with Venezuelan parties,
where he has been running campaigns since the early 1970s.
   Campaign advisers typically go to a country, conduct polls to
find out what the key issues are among uncommitted voters, then
target those ``swing'' issues, which may not be the concerns of the
majority of the public.
   Sabato, an expert on campaign advisers, believes reliance on
advisers and polls to chose campaign themes leads to passive,
reaction-oriented government.
   ``I think there's a natural tension between a representative's
role as a delegate, a faithful mirror of the constituency, and as a
trustee, someone who is charged with making the right decisions,
even if they are unpopular,'' said Sabato.
   ``If you are wedded to polling results, and if they are readily
available to you and consultants are constantly whispering in your
ear and telling you what people are demanding, you're much more
inclined to fulfill your delegate's role to the detriment of your
trusteeship.''
   The consultants flatly disagree.
   ``You can't have it both ways. Sometimes you have presidents in
this country and others who are criticized because they are poorly
advised or don't have advisers,'' said Napolitan.
   ``You can't say the guy should not have advisers; what is the
whole government for, really, but to advise the president? What's
the difference if he gets expertise inside the country or outside
the country?''
   The International Association of Political Consultants has about
125 members, more than half of them American. Most of the rest are
from Europe, but there are also Australian, Japanese, South and
Central American and Middle Eastern members.
   American advisers draw on the experience they gain in the
elaborate U.S. campaigns for Congress and the presidency.
   ``This year, we'll have 400 or 500 elections in America, many of
them very hard-fought campaigns with a lot of money being spent,''
said Napolitan. ``Venezuela has one every five years. ... I work on
more elections in a two-year period, for example, than any Latin
American has worked on in his life.''

   It's a familiar role: the voice of wisdom and
experience prevailing over headstrong young charges eager to take
on the world.
   Lorne Greene was the father figure, as well as the father, in
``Bonanza.'' Tige Andrews looked after hippie cops in ``The Mod
Squad.'' Harry Morgan was the gruff but forgiving leader of the
misfits in ``M-A-S-H.''
   In the case of Fox Broadcasting Co.'s hard-driving, pulsating,
young crime drama, ``21 Jump Street,'' the job goes to Steven
Williams.
   Williams, as Capt. Adam Fuller, oversees a squad of rookie cops
whose baby-faced looks allow them to pose as teen-age toughs and
ferret out high-school criminals. The show also stars Johnny Depp,
Holly Robinson, Dustin Nguyen and Peter DeLuise. Richard Grieco
joins the cast in the new season as a rebel policeman partnered
with Depp.
   ``I'm the daddy of `Jump Street,''' said Williams in an
interview the day before he returned to Vancouver, Canada, to
resume filming on the series.
   ``Peter calls me `the eye of the storm.' I'm the big cheese in
charge. The Fuller we like to see is the consummate professional
cop. That's his job. He teaches these young people. He's their
friend, but he's also a student himself. He learns from them. His
first duty is to make sure his wards become good cops and survive.
Undercover work is dangerous, both physically and mentally.''
   The tall, slender actor, with a beard and moustache, took over
the role from Frederic Forrest after about six episodes. Forrest's
role was written as a throwback to the 1960s. But the producers
felt the young people who watch the show couldn't relate to that.
Fuller is a very contemporary character.
   Williams previously starred as Lt. Jefferson Burnett on the
first season of CBS' ``The Equalizer'' and was the policeman in hot
pursuit of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd in ``Blues Brothers.''
   Prior to taking over the role, he rode with officers from the
Los Angeles Police Department.
   ``I learned from that how dangerous undercover work is,'' he
said. ``They put their lives on the line every day. They deal with
the worst element. And when you're undercover it can be emotionally
tough because you lose your identity. You start to identify with
the other side.''
   Williams said he also asked policemen what they think when they
see officers portrayed on television. ``They said they hate seeing
cops do dumb things,'' he said. ``You always see a cop stick his
finger in dope and taste it. Real cops never do that. It could be
some bad stuff and they'd die. You see cops check their weapons
with all the sound effects _ click, click, click! Cops know their
weapons; they don't have to do that.''
   ``21 Jump Street'' is currently Fox's third highest-rated show,
behind ``America's Most Wanted'' and ``Married ... With Children.''
It was the fledgling network's top show before the debut of
``America's Most Wanted.''
   The show recently received a Presidential Citation for tackling
such issues as teen-age drug abuse, AIDS, gang violence, runaways,
child abuse and pornography. It has also frequently provided
hotline numbers where youths can find help.
   ``My character has gone undercover a few times,'' Williams said.
``Once as a uniformed cop and once as a man looking for a loan. I
could go undercover as a teacher to look for guns in a school. The
show provides an opportunity for me to stretch as an actor.
   ``I'd like to work undercover as a priest, as a bum, a nightclub
singer. You can play a lot of different attitudes. Fuller could
even go undercover and do a school production of `Othello.'''
   Williams was born in Memphis, Tenn., but he spent time with his
father in Flint, Mich., his mother in Chicago and his maternal
grandparents in Millington, Tenn. He discovered acting while in the
Army in West Germany. He was a boxer, and he and a friend began to
stage mock fights to develop their timing and reflexes. That led to
an interest in acting.
   On his return to Chicago, he became a model, then got into local
theater when he returned to Chicago. He also appeared in a number
of movies filmed in Chicago _ ``Mahogany,'' ``Cooley High,''
``Dummy'' and ``Blues Brothers.''
   He moved to Los Angeles in 1980 and immediately was cast in
various series and feature and TV movies.
   His role as the father figure in ``21 Jump Street'' is not a new
one. He has two grown daughters. His wife, Ann Geddes, is a talent
agent.

<HEAD>Robert Loggia Is Maverick FBI Agent in NBC's `Favorite Son'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The political coverup in the NBC miniseries
``Favorite Son'' might have worked if the conspirators hadn't
underestimated the cynical, jaded, veteran FBI agent assigned to
the case.
   An unknown sniper has assassinated a Contra leader and wounded a
U.S. senator on the Capitol steps, and the president's chief of
staff doesn't want the case solved.
   So the case goes to Nick Mancuso, an FBI agent on the verge of
retirement, and David Ross, an inexperienced young agent.
   ``He's not over the hill,'' said Robert Loggia, who plays
Mancuso. ``He's being forced to retire at 55, because that's FBI
policy. He's a maverick agent, which exists in the FBI. They're not
all plastic men. The heavies pick him, because they think he's past
his prime, and the kid's a greenhorn. A couple of stiffs who'll
botch the job.
   ``Mancuso's the conscience of the piece. I guess in his own way
he's the real patriot of the piece. He's a man doing his job well,
serving his country well. He can make a difference as an
individual.''
   ``Favorite Son,'' which centers on a plot to win the
presidential nomination, will air just one week before the real
presidential election. The six-hour, three-part miniseries, based
on the best-selling political thriller by Steve Sohmer, runs
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Oct. 31-Nov. 2.
   Harry Hamlin stars as an ambitious young senator, Linda
Kozlowski as his even more ambitious image-maker, Lance Guest as
Loggia's FBI partner, James Whitmore as the president, Stepfanie
Kramer as the producer of a TV morning show, Ronny Cox as the head
of the CIA, Kenneth McMillan as the head of the FBI and Mitchell
Ryan as the vice president. Jeff Bleckner directed from Sohmer's
screenplay.
   ``Favorite Son'' is a powerful story of corruption in high
places, and as the suspense builds, viewers will be guessing until
the end which are the good guys and which are the villains.
   The complex story functions on several levels. It's a thriller
about a murderous plot to capture the presidential nomination. It
examines the power of television in making or breaking a candidate.
And it's a vehicle that could lead to a series for Robert Loggia,
one of the hottest and most talented character actors in movies and
television.
   ``It could be a pilot, but there are a few other steps,'' said
Loggia. ``We might do a movie-of-the-week on Mancuso. It's a really
a case of wait-and-see. See what kind of ratings numbers it gets.
Nick Mancuso is a good character, but I don't know if it can be
projected into a series.''
   Mancuso is similar to Sam Ransom, the rumpled detective that
earned an Oscar nomination for Loggia in the feature film ``The
Jagged Edge.'' Loggia calls Nick an Italian version of Sam.
   ``We didn't do this picture with FBI cooperation,'' said Loggia.
``But when we did `An Officer and a Gentleman,' the Navy was very
apprehensive and didn't cooperate. Then afterward, it came to be
used by the Navy as a recruiting film. I wouldn't be surprised if a
lot of young guys sign up for the FBI after seeing this miniseries.
We see Mancuso go full out. You see what makes him tick. In the
end, the resolution of this character is very positive.''
   Loggia's acting career goes back to the days of live television.
He starred in two series, ``The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca'' in 1958
on the Disney show and ``T.H.E. Cat'' in 1966-67. But in recent
years, his career has exploded.
   It started with his role as a boozing sailor in ``An Officer and
a Gentleman.'' He was a Cuban drug kingpin in ``Scarface,'' a Mafia
lawyer in ``Prizzi's Honor,'' a detective in ``The Believers,''
Anwar Sadat in ``A Woman Called Golda,'' a beachcomber in ``Hot
Pursuit,'' the murderous school principal in ``Echoes in the
Darkness'' and a warmhearted toy manufacturer in the current hit
``Big.''
   ``I got a nomination for `Jagged Edge,' which wasn't expected,''
he said. ``The producer and director didn't expect the role to have
that kind of impact. It's not a bad way to work, to give more than
they expect. The best thing is you're not trapped in a heavy or
ethnic role.
   ``I think you aim for this kind of thing. You can be a one-trick
pony or have a whole bag of tricks. I guess what we're at now is to
go from character supporting actor to character leading man. I'd
certainly rather carry the ball. I think `Favorite Son' will help
in this.''
   Loggia recently returned from Sri Lanka where he co-starred with
David Warner, Brian Kerwin and Alice Krige in a spy movie. A
permanent title hasn't been selected, but it's been known as
``Spies on Ice'' and ``Spooks.''
   Next, he goes to Chicago to play the father in a family drama
for CBS called ``The O'Connors.''
   ``It's a morality conflict,'' he said. ``We're an Irish Catholic
family. One son's a priest, one's in real estate at a heavy level.
Hal Linden plays a big real estate operator.''

   The drought was the last thing North Dakota's

   The drought that laid waste millions of
acres of wheat and grazing land across the Midwest now threatens to
create a new victim: North Dakota's already hard-pressed schools.
   Few states are suffering more acutely from the drought than
North Dakota, whose highly regarded schools were already reeling
from a prolonged slump in crop and energy prices. Drought-affected
states like Illinois, Oklahoma and Nebraska have cut or frozen
education spending this year. But North Dakota's current state
appropriation of $346.4 million is fully $42 million less than it
spent on public schools seven years ago.
   ``How serious is the drought for our schools? On a scale of one
to 10, it is about an eight. It's very serious. It wouldn't have
been so serious if we hadn't been struggling for the last six years
with the oil problem,'' said Gov. George Sinner.
   The drought has so far cost this economically depressed state $2
billion, a 10 percent drop in the state's gross product, Sinner
said in an interview. At a time when the push for school reform was
prompting many states to boost spending, Sinner this fall had to
cut school aid 2 percent, or $9 million, the fourth education cut
in North Dakota in as many years.
   The latest cut means state aid dropped by $52 per pupil.
Spending per pupil is $3,481, 31st in the nation. Six years ago,
the state ranked 23rd.
   Teacher salaries average $21,660, 47th in the nation. Six years
ago, they ranked 30th.
   Yet in many ways, the crisis is paradoxical. North Dakotans from
the governor on down tend to regard public schools, for all their
apparent troubles, as a comparative bright spot in the state's
picture.
   The state's 118,000 students generally score well in tests of
basic skills. Ninety percent graduate from high school, the third
best rate in the nation, although educators concede that's at least
partly because school is the only game in town for rural
youngsters, especially in hard times.
   A statewide poll last September by the University of North
Dakota found that 41 percent of respondents think schools have
improved from five years ago; a comparable Gallup poll conducted
nationwide found just 25 percent of respondents felt that way about
their schools.
   Demographically, the schools have much going for them. The state
has fewer single-parent families than the national average. North
Dakotans are ethnically homogeneous. The state has a long, ardent
tradition of support for public education.
   Many here refer glowingly to the ``prairie ethic,'' the
toughness of the early German and Scandinavian settlers who a
century ago turned this harsh land into the nation's leading wheat
producer.
   Yet that very ethic may be making North Dakotans slow to react
to the schools crisis, educators fear. There is practically no
chance for new state taxes this year to bail out schools, said
state senator Bonnie Heinrich, a member of the Legislature's
education finance committee.
   ``The prairie ethic is a double-edged sword because we've got to
change. We can't just ask, how did our ancestors tough it out
before?'' said David Smette, superintendent of the Dickinson school
district, located in the western section of the state hardest hit
by the agricultural and energy slumps.
   The biggest fear is that the drought will hasten the already
pronounced exodus of teachers and young people. North Dakota has
become a favorite recruiting ground for teachers, especially for
districts in Texas, California and Arizona that promise higher
salaries and appealing lifestyles, said Peg Portscheller, president
of the North Dakota Education Association.
   ``Right now the talk (among teachers) of leaving is more than at
any time I've ever heard,'' said James Peters, a guidance counselor
at Dickinson High School.
   Seventy percent of young North Dakotans are leaving the state
after finishing school, said Portscheller. In the most depressed
places like Dickinson, it's worse. A visitor asked 50 high school
seniors at Dickinson High if they would stay in the state. One said
he would.
   ``I don't think there are a lot of job opportunities here,''
said Nicole Fruh, 17, who plans to attend the University of
Minnesota at Morris next year.
   Mary Johnson, president of Dickinson's board of education, said,
``I've got a brother in Denver, a brother in Minneapolis, my sister
left for Oregon to look for work, another sister's in New Jersey,
and my folks are in Arizona. I wouldn't be surprised if my three
kids leave someday. That's the story of North Dakota.''
   Leaving the state is ``not necessarily what kids want. But we're
not giving them the opportunity to dream, to explore, to build,''
said Portscheller.
   North Dakota ranks 50th in the number of students enrolled in
advanced placement high school classes. Many schools lack art
programs and offer little or no advanced math or science. Only 19
percent of high school students take a foreign language, compared
with a third of high schoolers nationwide.
   In North Dakota ``reform isn't on the backburner. It isn't even
on the stove,'' said Portscheller.
   ``Most people in this state think schools are OK. But educators
generally agree that we're in a state of crisis. We've put children
on hold,'' she said. ``We do a good job with basic skills ... but
if you look beyond the basics, like problem solving and the ability
to make good decisions, I'm not sure we're cutting the mustard.''
   In Dickinson, where teachers and administrators have already
been laid off, there is talk of eliminating entire programs if the
economy doesn't improve.
   Science labs at Dickinson High are short of specimens,
microscopes and other equipment. The elementary school has no
central library and just one instructional computer.
   The Dickinson district cut $1.2 million from its budget in the
last two years. The current $9.8 million budget includes a $500,000
deficit that will almost certainly lead to more cuts and possibly
layoffs.
   As area oil jobs have disappeared and farm prices have dropped,
land values have declined and school budgets heavily dependent on
property taxes have suffered accordingly. Dickinson's property tax
valuations have dropped from a high of $24 million in 1984 to a
current $17 million. Local real estate agent Robert Karn said homes
that sold for $68,000 four years ago now go for $32,000.
   For many small districts, the drought may prove the last straw
before consolidation _ a dreaded step in isolated towns where
having a school is what keeps them on the map. But many such
districts barely meet minimum standards, according to a report on
North Dakota school problems issued last January.
   State Sen. Heinrich sighed when asked about the future of North
Dakota schools.
   ``There's always hope,'' she said. ``If the feds come up with a
great drought program, if we can get some light industry, if OPEC
lets oil prices go up a bit. And if it would rain.''

   Crude oil futures trading has been volatile amid
rumors about OPEC production, and analysts predict the market will
remain nervous as long as the cartel's problems remain unresolved.
   The price for the November contract for West Texas Intermediate
oil changed course several times during Tuesday's session, trading
as high as $13.74 and as low as $13.30 a barrel. The contract for
the benchmark U.S. crude settled at $13.55, down 5 cents from
Monday's close.
   Like Monday's session _ when November West Texas Intermediate
climbed 66 cents _ Tuesday's trading was dominated by rumors and
speculation about production by the 13-members Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said.
   Prices rose Monday as Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
exporter, reaffirmed it would stick to its production quota if
other members of OPEC did.
   On Tuesday, prices again moved higher, said Richard Redoglia, a
trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. But the market turned
lower when Saudi King Fahd failed to discuss OPEC member's
inability to stay within their output quotas during an address,
Redoglia said.
   Rumors that the United Arab Emirates was willing to cut its
production then hit the market, and prices advanced again before
finally slipping lower at the end of the day, he said.
   Redoglia, who described trading as volatile, attributed
Tuesday's brief rallies to short covering, in which investors buy
contracts to offset those they sold earlier.
   He said the market's underlying fundamentals remained negative.
   ``The bearishness about OPEC overproduction is still there,'' he
said, predicting, ``the market is going to continue trading like
this'' until OPEC can resolve its differences.
   In other trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.62 cent to
settle at 40.79 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 0.12
cent to 39.08 cents a gallon.

   Sales of U.S. Savings Bonds dropped for the
fifth time in six months in September, falling 10.8 percent to $519
million, according to the government.
   The Treasury Department said Tuesday that September sales were
$63 million lower than in August, when they had risen 3.4 percent
from the month before. Sales had fallen by 8.5 percent in July, 6.1
percent in June, 0.9 percent in May and 6.4 percent in April.
Before that, sales rose for eight months in a row, hitting $706
million in March.
   September sales were up 9.5 percent from the same month a year
ago. But sales for fiscal year 1988, which ended Sept. 30, totaled
$7.26 billion, a 29.5 percent decline from fiscal 1987, when sales
set a post-World War II record of $10.3 billion.
   Since November 1982, savings bonds held five years or longer
earn market-based interest rates. The current rate, in effect
through the end of this month, is 6.90 percent, down from 7.17
percent in the six months ended April 30.
   When market interest rates rise relative to savings bonds, as
they have since March, bond sales tend to decline. A new savings
bond rate, which will likely be higher, will be announced Nov. 1.
   Effective Sept. 30, the Treasury Department scrapped a
five-month experiment to bolster sales by offering consumers a
toll-free, 24-hour telephone number to purchase bonds using a
credit card. The program ``proved not cost-effective,'' the
department said.

   The dollar dropped sharply against the Japanese yen
today for the second straight day, while share prices edged down on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar finished trading at 129.65 yen, down 1.50 yen from
Tuesday's close of 131.15 yen. This is the lowest since Jun. 24,
when it closed at 129.70 yen. Opening at 131.12 yen, the currency
moved between 129.60 yen and 131.38 yen.
   On Tuesday the dollar plummeted 2.35 yen, dropping from Friday's
close of 133.50 yen.
   ``Speculative investors' dollar-selling dominated the trading,
and hardly anybody was buying the dollar,'' a dealer with Daiwa
Bank said today.
   The release in Washington of unemployment in September, which
fell to 5.4 percent, ended concern over inflation and lowered U.S.
interest rates, he said.
   ``So it is no longer profitable for investors to buy the
currency with lower interest rates,'' the dealer said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Exchange lost 60.23 points, or 0.22
percent, closing at 27,409.37. It lost 212.69 points during the
morning session but gained most of that back.
   The volume traded on the first section was estimated at a light
600 million shares.
   ``Participants' uncertainty due to the emperor's illness and a
new development in the Recruit-Cosmos scandal were the two major
reasons of the market's loss today,'' said Manji Ueda with Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   ``There was no negative factor around the market otherwise. The
recent ideal economic factors have contributed to higher share
prices at overseas markets,'' he added.
   On Tuesday, Japan's Communist Party displayed documents it said

   The Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, which as been accused of participating in an
international drug money-laundering scheme, has 14,000 employees in
400 offices in 72 countries.
   BCCI Holdings, which reports assets of $20.6 billion, and two
subsidiaries were among the 85 defendants named in federal
indictments unsealed Tuesday.
   While the bank, which was started in 1972, is based in
Luxembourg, it has central offices in London. It is owned by a
large group of shareholders, but its stock is not publicly traded,
said Tampa branch spokesman Marvin Hancock.
   Although a two-year U.S. Customs undercover sting operation was
based in Tampa, no local employees were named in the indictments.
Hancock said the branch continues normal operations.
   ``We're not a retail `street bank,''' said branch manager Raghu
Bahdur. ``We have no walk-in trade at all.''
   A typical transaction would be to help a company in Alabama
export frozen chicken to clients in the Middle East, Hancock said.
   The banks' clients are typically companies and individuals in
the export-import business.
   ``We're permitted to lend money to anybody,'' said Hancock.
``We're just not permitted to take deposits from anybody unless the
funds are used for international transactions.''
   Like most banks, the U.S. offices of BCCI are subject to audits
by state and federal regulators, its outside auditing firm of Price
Waterhouse and internal auditors, Bahdur said.
   Besides Tampa, BCCI has U.S. offices in Boca Raton, Miami, New
York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   Its other U.S. operations are non-banking offices in Washington,
D.C., Chicago, Houston and Beverly Hills.

   The wedding invitations, printed in delicate
script, were mailed to a select group of international bankers
promising a grand affair.
   But the ``bride'' and ``groom'' were really undercover federal
agents and the nuptials were a charade which resulted in the arrest
of 11 party-goers linked to an alleged international drug and
money-laundering operation.
   Seven of the 11 were nabbed Saturday night as they rolled into
Tampa in chauffeured limousines for what was supposed to be a wild
bachelor party in a penthouse suite.
   ``They thought they were really going to a stag party. Not a one
of them had any idea of what was going on,'' Joseph P. Ladow Jr.,
assistant special agent in charge of the U.S. Customs office in
Tampa, said Tuesday after indictments were unsealed naming 85
defendants, including an international bank.
   Individuals in 10 U.S. cities and Paris and London were accused
of participating in a ring that laundered profits for the Colombian
cocaine trade through the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, or BCCI Holdings.
   BCCI, two subsidiaries and nine bank officials were charged with
laundering $14 million in drug profits collected in seven U.S.
cities.
   The elaborate wedding ruse began months ago when federal
authorities tried to come up with a way to arrest as many suspects
at once to reduce the chances they would escape.
   ``A wedding was a perfect opportunity,'' Ladow said.
   An undercover Customs agent had infiltrated the alleged money
laundering operation posing as a financier and investor. As his
relationship with suspects developed, he introduced a woman he said
was his fiancee and business partner.
   The couple became a part of the suspects' social and business
scene, traveling to parties, dinner engagements and sporting
events, including a championship boxing match in Miami, authorities
said.
   Six months ago they announced their engagement.
   Invitations went out for the marriage of Kathleen Corrine
Erickson and Robert L. Musella, the agents' fictitious names.
   The affair was set for Sunday at the exclusive Innisbrook Resort
and Golf Club near Tarpon Springs, 35 miles northewest of Tampa.
Federal agents did not tip the resort to their plan.
   As guests and their families arrived they were greeted by
undercover agents posing as friends of the happy couple and were
wined and dined at cocktail parties.
   Eight to 10 limousines ferried party-goers to Tampa for the
bachelor bash.
   ``We had undercover agents in the cars,'' Ladow said. ``All the
way over, there were comments about, `Hey, we're going to party
tonight.' ''
   When the bankers stepped off an elevator into the arm of waiting
agents they didn't understand what was happening, officials said.
   One suspect apparently had been to a recent striptease party
where a dancer placed handcuffs on him before her bump-and-grind
routine. So when the handcuffs were slapped on him Saturday night,
he didn't get upset, according to agents.
   ``He was all smiles. He said, `All right, let's party!' '' said
Ladow. ``He thought it was a prelude to the same thing.''
   But as things began to sink in, another suspect moaned: ``I
thought they could only do this in the movies.''

   The stock market took a tumble today as traders
uneasily awaited Thursday's monthly report on the nation's
international trade position.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 18.13 to 2,138.34
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 161 up, 884
down and 392 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.83 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The day began amid widespread talk that the nation's trade
deficit for August, due to be reported Thursday by the Commerce
Department, would be larger than previously expected.
   That conjecture contributed to weakness in the dollar in foreign
exchange, and interest rates rose in the credit markets.
   Analysts also said there was some disappointment among traders
over the market's inability to extend the rally that carried the
Dow Jones industrial average to its highest closing level of the
year on Monday.
   Motorola fell 2| to 40 in active trading. Brokers said the
company's third quarter earnings of 67 cents a share, up from 54
cents in the like period last year, came in short of expectations
on Wall Street.
   Elsewhere among the volume leaders, Merck dropped ~ to 58\;
International Business Machines lost 1 to 117}, and American
Telephone & Telegraph was down [ at 26}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.30 to 155.47. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.09 at 302.68.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.49 to
2,156.47.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
593 issues up, 823 down and 535 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 140.90 million shares,
up from 124.66 million in the previous session.

   Two OPEC committees will meet in Madrid
on Oct.20, apparently to discuss tumbling oil prices at a time of
overproduction and disarray in the world oil market, OPEC Secretary
General Subroto announced Wednesday.
   The announcement, carried by OPENA, the news agency of the
13-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, did
not provide an agenda or other details.
   It said the two committees will hold their first joint meeting
in the Spanish capital.
   They are the Committee on Price Evolution, comprising the oil
ministers of Algeria, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela, and the Long-Term Strategy Committee consisting of the
oil ministers of Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela.
   World oil prices have plunged recently, running more than $5 a
barrel below the cartel's benchmark of $18 for a 42-gallon barrel.
   Several OPEC member countries have considerably exceeded their
production quotas. Their conduct and longterm energy saving
measures introduced in many industrialized countries have triggered
a decline in prices.
   Subroto said recently prices could plummet to $5 a barrel if
Saudi Arabia _ the world's largest oil exporter _ exploited its
production capacity to force other OPEC members to obsderve their
quotas.
   A full ministerial conference of the organization is scheduled
to take place in Vienna on Nov. 21.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The broiler, a tender young chicken that
doesn't live to a ripe old age, is gradually becoming a locally
grown food item in the Third World instead of an imported delicacy,
says Agriculture Department analyst ary Vocke.
   One reason has been the modernization of chicken production in
some Third World countries, where technology and U.S. grain have
been used to begin or expand domestic broiler industries.
   ``For example,'' he said, ``the grandparents of a broiler raised
in Saudi Arabia may be from Europe, the corn in his (feed) ration
from the United States, and the soybean meal from Brazil.''
   Vocke added: ``The automated feeding equipment that delivers the
ration may be from the United States. The Saudi Arabian family that
eats this broiler probably used to eat chicken from Western Europe
and the United States.''
   Because of the rapid growth of poultry production, the Third
World has become a net importer of coarse grains such as corn and
sorghum, he said. And continued expansion ``will likely create even
more markets'' for the United States and other grain exporters.
   Vocke, who works in the department's Economic Research Service,
described Third World poultry development and its impact on trade
in a new report on world agriculture.
   The countries listed as major chicken meat importers included
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Yemen Arab
Republic, Oman, Jamaica, Iran, Zaire and Mexico. Third World
exporters included Brazil and Thailand.
   Modern broiler production, even in countries that are short on
feed, doesn't have to be linked to land and climate, the way crop
production is.
   ``Raising broilers has become an industrial activity, the final
step in the production process,'' Vocke said. ``The first step
includes grain producers and foundation poultry breeders. The grain
and breeding stock they produce are inputs for feed manufacturing
and hatching egg operations.''
   The feed rations and young chicks are the ingredients for the
final step, raising the chicks to market size. Because grain and
breeding stock are easily transported, broilers can be raised
almost anywhere.
   Vocke noted that the broiler industry, which was pioneered in
the United States and raised to a high degree of specialization, is
relatively new. Sixty years ago chickens were raised mostly for
eggs by farm families. Chicken meat, from young ``fryers'' and old
hens, was a byproduct.
   City consumers found chicken often expensive relative to pork
and beef. In grandmother's time, chicken on Sunday was a family
treat.
   ``These conditions are not much different from those found in
many Third World countries today,'' Vocke said. ``Few foresaw the
technological and organizational innovations that created the
broiler industry.''
   The integration of the industry from feed preparation to
slaughter and marketing resulted in reduced broiler production
costs and lower retail prices. Broilers made a hit with American
shoppers and consumption levels rose.
   It is this experience that is being relived in the Third World.
But Vocke said the technology transfer to the countries beginning
to expand poultry output requires money, or foreign exchange, for
the purchase of hatching and growing facilities.
   ``Feed mills for preparing rations are a high priority,'' he
said. ``A local mill can reduce the recurring cost of importing
feeds, even if some of the ingredients still have to be imported.''
   Also, storage bins and equipment for feed ingredients may have
to be imported, and if slaughtering is to be done in modern plants,
that could mean further import spending.
   ``In traditional markets, chickens are sold live and often
slaughtered on the spot,'' Vocke said. ``With urbanization and
increasing concern about sanitation, slaughtering in plants becomes
more common.''
   Broiler productivity has been hampered by the shortage of
foreign exchange in some Third World countries, he said. Zimbabwe,
for example, is self-sufficient in grains but has a lack of foreign
exchange to import vitamins, medicines and minerals for use in
higher quality feed.
   The developing broiler industries are also hurt if they can't
import chicks or hatching eggs from the United States or Europe.
   Vocke said that the proportion of total poultry output coming
from modern operations is estimated at between a third and
two-thirds in the lower-income countries of Asia and Africa.
   ``In the higher income countries of Latin America, North Africa
and the Far East, the proportion is between 70 percent and 90
percent,'' he said. In some Middle Eastern countries, it is above
90 percent.''
   But broilers are not always the locally favored source of animal
protein, Vocke said. And, unlike chickens, grazing cattle, sheep
and goats don't compete with humans for grains grown for domestic
consumption or for foreign exchange to import grains.
   ``Some countries, however, do not have sufficient land or a
suitable climate either to provide grazing for ruminants (such as
cattle and goats) or to grow grain to feed poultry or pigs,'' he
said. ``When demand for animal proteins grows, countries can import
meat, or, in the case of broilers, may import the production
technology and the feed ingredients to raise the birds locally.''

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deliveries of some of Boeing Co.'s new 747-400
jumbo jets will be delayed by a month or so, Boeing Commercial
Airplanes said.
   Dean D. Thornton, president of the Boeing operating company,
said Tuesday that of the 161 747-400s ordered by 21 customers, 20
planes will be delivered an average of one month past the
previously agreed upon date.
   ``We intend to obtain Federal Aviation Administration
certification of the 747-400 in December, to deliver the first two
aircraft that month and to be back on our original schedule by
mid-1989,'' Thornton said.
   Two deliveries will be pushed back from December to early 1989,
and there will be a substantial reduction in first-quarter 1989
deliveries, the company said in a news release. Most of the
deliveries will be made up in the second quarter of 1989, it said.
   Thornton said far more orders for the new jet were received from
customers on an earlier schedule than anticipated when the program
was launched in October 1985.
   Thornton said the delays are due to the increase of 747
production rates at Boeing's Everett plant from two planes to five
a month and to customers seeking a wider variety of plane
configurations than on earlier programs.
   The delays also stem from the 747-400s being offered with three
different engine types, with each being introduced and certified in
a record four months.
   Boeing is doing its best to minimize the impact of the delays on
customers, Thornton said, including working overtime and
reassigning additional experienced workers to the 747 plant.
   The new jet, which made its first flight earlier this year, is
the largest commercial jet in production. The plane will be able to
carry 412 passengers more than 8,000 miles, and greater passenger
loads on shorter trips.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices were slightly lower while
corn and soybeans futures were a bit higher in early trading today
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices were pressured by fears that the United States and
the Soviet Union may revive their recently expired grain agreement
for one year rather than sign a new, multi-year pact, said Cathy
Leow, a grain and soybean analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities
Inc. in New York.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators are scheduled to meet Thursday and
Friday in London to discuss the possibility of a new multi-year
agreement.
   Corn and soybean prices opened slightly higher, but trading
activity was light and cautious ahead of this afternoon's revised
crop production report from the Agriculture Department.
   ``Things are usually dead ahead of a USDA report,'' Ms. Leow
said.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.33 a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.96} a bushel; oats
were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at $2.56 a
bushel; soybeans were { cent to 2 cents higher with November at
$7.95 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .60 cent higher with October at
72.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .53 cent higher
with October at 81.90 cents a pound; hogs were .07 cent lower to
.25 cent higher with October at 40.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .15 cent to .70 cent higher with February at 48.15
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled slightly lower Tuesday while pork futures
were mixed.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT that $6.4 billion will be net
proceeds.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Gas PLC and Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd.
announced today they were buyers of portions of Tenneco Inc.'s oil
and gas properties.
   Shell, part of the Royal Dutch-Shell Group, said it would buy
Tenneco's Colombian operations for $500 million, while British Gas
said it was the successful bidder for a hodgepodge of Tenneco's
international oil and gas interests with a $194.5 million offer.
   On Tuesday, Tenneco estimated the net proceeds from its asset
sale would be $6.4 billion on a gross take of $7.3 billion.
   Tenneco, based in Houston, Texas, is auctioning its oil and gas
interests to pay down $8.5 billion in debt and to concentrate on
its pipeline and industrial businesses. On Monday, eight other
companies announced they were buying various parts of the oil and
gas properties.
   The main Colombian operation Shell is buying is Houston Oil
Colombia SA, which is currently producing about 40,000 barrels a
day.
   Output from Tenneco's Colombian interests have been restrained
by pipeline constraints, and production will rise when a new
pipeline is installed, said a Shell official in London, who was not
identified, in accordance with British custom.
   Shell already has a 25 percent stake in the Cano Limon field in
Colombia, which it acquired when it bought Occidental Petroleum
Corp.'s Colombian operations in 1985. The field produces about
170,000 barrels a day.
   British Gas' purchase is a major step in its diversification
efforts since it was privatized by the government in late 1986.
   British Gas said it was buying all of Tenneco's non-North
American oil interests, excluding those in Norway and Colombia. The
purchase includes interests in Ecuador, Eygpt, Gabon, Malaysia,
Nigeria, the Bahamas, Trinidad, Tunisia and Britain.
   British Gas said the interests contain estimated proven and
probable reserves of 47 million barrels of oil equivalent. About
two-third's of the reserves are oil.
   British Gas has been increasing its non-gas and non-British
activities since its privatization. In 1987 it bought Acre Oil PLC
for 370 million pounds, or $640 million, and bought 51 percent of
Canada-based Bow Valley Industries Ltd. after a protracted battle
with Canadian regulators.
   In September, British Gas launched a ``dawn raid'' on London and
Scottish Marine Oil PLC, known as Lasmo, but only managed to get
about 1.1 percent of the company's stock, well short of its stated
intention of buying 14.9 percent.
   Among the transactions announced Monday, Chevron Corp. agreed to
buy Tenneco's Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas reserves,
production facilities and leasehold interests for nearly $2.6
billion.
   In other deals:
   _Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Limited Partnership agreed
to buy the mid-continent division oil and gas subsidiary for $715
million.
   _Fina Oil and Chemical Co., American Petrofina's principal
operating subsidiary, agreed to buy Tenneco's Gulf
Coast-Southwestern exploration and production business in a stock
purchase plan valued at a little more than $600 million.
   _Seagull Energy signed letters of intent to buy the outstanding
capital stock of Houston Oil & Minerals Corp., an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Tenneco, for $16.4 million.
   _Mobil Corp. announced it signed a definitive agreement to buy
Tenneco's Chalmette, La., refinery and related facilities for $560
million and an adjustment for working capital.
   _Atlantic Richfield Co. is buying Tenneco's California
operations for between $670 million and $700 million while Amoco
Corp. agreed to buy Tenneco Oil Co.'s Rocky Mountain division for
$900 million.
   _A subsidiary of Conoco Inc. agreed to purchase the Norwegian
affiliate of Tenneco for $115 million.
   After the sale, company officials said, Tenneco will comprise 31
percent farm and construction equipment, 23 percent pipeline, 14
percent shipbuilding, 13 percent auto parts, 10 percent packaging
and 9 percent chemical.

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump has bought the profitable Eastern
Airlines shuttle from Texas Air Corp. for $365 million cash and
will rename it after himself, it was announced today, but Eastern's
militant union leaders called the sale the death of the airline and
vowed a fight.
   ``I want to run it as a diamond, an absolute diamond,'' the
flamboyant real estate-gambling mogul proclaimed to reporters at a
joint news conference with Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo at the
Plaza Hotel in New York, another recent Trump acquisition.
   ``You're going to be flying with something that's quality and
good,'' Trump said of the moneymaking commuter service between the
heavily traveled cities of Boston, New York and Washington.
   He said the shuttle will now be called ``The Trump Shuttle'' and
its blue-silver Boeing 727s will be redecorated and emblazoned with
red, black and gold stripes. The deal is expected to be completed
by mid-December.
   Lorenzo told reporters the sale was ``not our preferrred
course.'' But he said Eastern's militant unions had created a
situation that deprived management of the right to negotiate.
   The Texas Air chief also confirmed speculation he had talked
with takeover strategist Carl Icahn, head of Trans World Airlines
Inc., about selling him other operations of Eastern, which
Lorenzo's company bought two years ago, creating the nation's
biggest airline company. Texas Air also owns Continental Airlines,
a non-union carrier based in Houston.
   Trump and Lorenzo said the shuttle will maintain fares
competitive with the Northeast shuttle service operated by Pan Am
Corp. and won't lay off any employees. The $365 million cash
acquisition, substantially above previous estimates of the
shuttle's sale price, includes landing rights at airports in the
three shuttle cities plus 17 planes.
   Trump noted recent reports that he intends to sell the land
earmarked for a huge new commercial development in Manhattan to
help finance the Shuttle deal. No interested party could afford to
pay him what the 100-acre site is worth, Trump joked to reporters.
   The sale marks another tumultuous chapter in the saga of
Eastern, the Miami-based carrier that has been scarred by
management-labor feuding and $1 billion in losses over the past
decade.
   The shuttle is considered Eastern's crown jewel. Eastern
officials testified recently that the shuttle is the airline's only
remaining profitable operation.
   When word of the deal leaked earlier today, Eastern's machinists
vowed to seek a federal court order against it.
   In Washington, attorney Joseph Guerrieri, representing the
Machinists union, said he was readying a request to U.S. District
Court in Washington to grant an injunction against the sale and
would file it later this week.
   ``The sale of the shuttle is the death knell of Eastern Airlines
as we know it. We just can't allow the employees to be walked over
in this manner. We intend to keep Eastern Airlines a viable entity
by seeking to enjoin this sale,'' Guerrieri said by telephone.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak confirmed pilots and flight
attendants unions were informed of the sale today but did not
disclose details.
   Nancy Currier, vice president of the Transport Workers Union
local representing Eastern flight attendants, said Eastern
management had told the union a copy of the agreement would be sent
to the unions later.
   Ron Cole, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association local
representing Eastern pilots, said earlier that his union opposes
the sale and ``we will take whatever legal means is possible.''
   The shuttle was made into a separate division last year,
clearing the way for a possible sale.
   In February 1988, Eastern announced plans to sell the new
division for $225 million cash and marketable securities to
Air-Shuttle L.P., a new subsidiary of Texas Air.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt blocked the plan with a
contempt of court finding against Eastern in March. A federal
appeals court reversed the contempt order in June but left the door
open for the unions to continue legal action. In July, Eastern
announced the cancellation of the plan.
   Reports surfaced recently that the shuttle was again for sale _
this time to an outside buyer.
   Trump's desire for the shuttle became known last week.

Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall before 3,000 guests comes a year
after it had been promised, prompting critics to dub the
secrecy-shrouded machine the ``Eventually.''
   The computer won't immediately be available, and Next Inc. of
Palo Alto, Calif., so far has refused to say when the machine will
be on the market.
   Besides its release date, the big question is the machine's
price tag.
   Next's machine is designed with the power of an engineering
workstation, the kind that normally sells for upwards of $30,000 to
$50,000. Jobs has promised to offer it for considerably less, but
just how much less is unknown.
   Analysts early on speculated the machine would range from $3,000
to $5,000, but estimates now range up to $7,000 to $10,000.
   Jobs, who co-founded Apple Computer in 1976 in his parents'
garage, has said the Next computer was initially designed for
college students and academic researchers, although analysts
believe he now envisions a wider market.
   It's been speculated his machine will be capable of competing
with such hot-selling technical workstations as those from Sun
Microsytems Inc., Apollo Computer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Some
of those companies are working on similar products that eventually
will be sold for about $15,000.
   Jonathan Seybold, a leading Los Angeles-based trade publisher
who has seen the Next, says industry critics `` ... all going to
change their minds'' after the machine's debut.
   ``From a hardware and software standpoint, this is a remarkable
achievement ... and will have a significant impact that will spread
well beyond the number of computers Next will sell,'' he said in a
recent interview.
   Some details of the computer have leaked out, the most reliable
one being its unusual visual design with a black magnesium case and
17-inch monochrome monitor.
   Dazzling Display Postscript software by Adobe Systems and other
software are widely expected to give exceptionally vivid graphics _
possibly offering photo-like realism _ and numerous type fonts and
sizes. A laser printer also is expected to be offered, which would
vastly improve industry reproduction quality standards.
   In hardware, the Next is expected to come with an erasable
optical disk drive, which could increase current computer storage
as much as 50 times, allow the storage of detailed images such as
photographs and give stereo-sound capability.
   Jobs himself has indicated the computer will have a 32-bit
Motorola 68030 chip, the industry's fastest; a connector to an
industry standard network called Ethernet that will allow Next to
share files with other types of computers; and Mathematica
software, of special use for sophisticated math equations.
   ``This is going to be the biggest little computer in the
world,'' said Greg Stephens, an independent Santa Clara software
specialist.
   A computer workstation is a machine about halfway between the
computing capabilities of a personal computer and a mainframe.

   The baby of the Honda family has grown _ not up,
but stronger and longer.
   Redesigned for the 1988 model year, the Civic Hatchback DX
showed just how far the Honda Civic has come since its U.S.
introduction in March 1973.
   Back then, the car was 146.9 inches long, with 86.6-inch
wheelbase and curb weight of 1,605 pounds. It looked something akin
to a beer can on wheels. The 1988 Civic Hatchback DX test car was
9.2 inches longer, nearly 400 pounds heavier and had a wheelbase
that had grown by nearly 12 inches.
   Add the new model's 1.5-liter, 16-valve, fuel-injected,
four-cylinder engine _ the early Civic had a puny 1,200-cc engine
in 1973 _ and this is no beer can any longer.
   The Civic line, Honda's lowest-priced car line, offers sedan,
hatchback and wagon models.
   But it doesn't get just first-time car owners. Honda said median
age of buyers of the test car, the Hatchback DX, is about 35, and
median household income is $38,300. Spokesman Bob Butorac said 59.4
percent are male and 76.3 percent have college education.
   The Civic line has done well over the years. Looking at the
previous Civic redesign beginning in the 1984 model year, for
example, sales increased steadily, from 136,401 in calendar 1984 to
173,110 in 1987. That's a far cry from the 38,957 Civics sold in
calendar 1973.
   Price has increased, too. Base price for the Hatchback DX is
$8,310 compared with $2,250 for a hatchback Civic in 1973.
   Competition also has changed. Today, the Civic faces a number of
subcompact rivals, some with lower starting prices. Among them are
the Toyota Corolla FX, which starts around $8,000, and Mazda 323,
which starts at more than $6,000. There's also the subcompact
Hyundai Excel hatchback, which starts at $5,395.
   But Butorac said the Civic has a substantially different class
of standard features and a substantially different powertrain, and
Honda doesn't consider the Hyundai a direct competitor. Hyundai
officials name the Civic as one of their competitors, however.
   The test Civic Hatchback DX showed why, even with all the
competition, some buyers still decide on the Civic.
   Fit and finish was excellent inside and out. The car, with
five-speed manual transmission, was peppy, thanks to the the 90
horsepower the engine can crank out. The engine is standard in the
Hatchback DX, but a 70-horspower version is standard in regular
Civic Hatchback model.
   The car was fun to drive around town, and fit in small parking
spaces easily _ most of the time. At times, however, such as when
the car was at a standstill, it took effort to move the steering
wheel. There was no power steering.
   On the highway, the car moved well, but the ride could be
punishing, jostling. There also was a fair amount of road noise.
But fuel economy was admirable, with the car getting 30-plus miles
to the gallon in demanding driving in both the city and on the
highway.
   The interior was pleasant, with easy to read gauges and
molded-type front bucket seats that looked modern. Rear legroom was
nearly nonexistent if the front seats were pushed all the way back
and reclined some. There were three seat belts in the back, but
three adults would have a tough time sitting there for long.
   The car had nice touches. To the left of the driver was a small
drawer for coins. The hatchback area was covered by a ledge that
hid items stored below. The ledge doubled as a shelf for the rear
seat. If more cargo room was needed, the split rear seat folded
down.
   While the 1988 redesigned Civic is too new for reliability
tests, past Consumer Reports rankings based on owner reports of
trouble showed 1982-86 Civics had a much better than average rating.

<TEXT>
   A day after the board of directors of
Holly Farms Corp. approved a defense plan against hostile
takeovers, rival poultry processor Tyson Foods Inc. made a $1
billion offer to buy the company.
   Springdale-based Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor,
on Tuesday offered $45 cash and a quarter share of its Class A
common stock for each of Holly Farms 18.1 million outstanding
shares.
   The deal would be worth $1 billion based on Tuesday's closing
prices: Holly Farms closed at $43 a share, up $2.37{ in New York
Stock Exchange trading, while Tyson rose 62.5 cents a share to
$17.62{ in national over-the-counter trading.
   Officials of Holly Farms, based in Memphis, Tenn., said today
its board of directors would consider the offer ``in due course''
but declined further comment.
   Robert Justice, Tyson executive vice president for community
relations, said Tyson general counsel Jim Blair would not be
available to answer questions Tuesday night.
   Several hours before Tyson announced its offer, Holly Farms had
announced it had been approached by an unidentified company
regarding a possible business combination. Holly Farms said no
specific proposal had been received and Holly Farms did not intend
to seek one.
   ``The board of directors of Holly Farms believes the best
long-term interests of the company and its shareholders will be
served by the company continuing to operate as an independent
entity,'' stated R. Lee Taylor, president and chief and executive
officer.
   The company also said it had activated a shareholder rights
plan, commonly known as a ``poison pill'' takeover defense, aimed
at making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.
   In a letter to Taylor, Tyson Chairman and Chief Executive Don
Tyson, son of the company's founder, referred to a meeting with
Holly Farms officials four weeks ago in Memphis and said he
believed it was an ideal time for the companies to merge.
   Tyson said the offer would expire by close of business Oct. 19
and asked for access to nonpublic corporate information from Holly
Farms to help determine whether his company might increase its
offer.
   Tyson is a wholly-integrated poultry company which produces 14
million pounds of chicken meat a week, according to Justice.
   Justice said Tyson has hatcheries, grows its own chickens,
operates its own feed mills, has its own processing plants and
markets both whole chickens and ``value enhanced products'' to
supermarkets, fast food chains, and institutional customers.
   According to the company's 1987 annual report, Tyson had gross
sales last year of about $1.8 billion, with net income of $67
million. Tyson has 25,600 employees, Justice said.
   Holly Farms is a diversified foods company, with about 50
percent of its sales concentrated in chicken. The company also
provides other meats for the food service industry and mills flour.
   Holly Farms apparently made its announcement before receiving
the Tyson proposal, stating that it had not received any written
proposals.
   Holly Farms spokesman Ted Bailey in Memphis declined to comment
at that time on how many businesses had expressed interest in a
merger or which companies were involved.
   ``We remain committed to our shareholders, a leader in long-term
investment performance for shareholders, a leader in long-term
dividend growth and a leader in financial strength and cash flow,''
Taylor said. ``We believe we have established a superior record in
all these respects, even in poor years. We have every reason to
believe that our future record will be even better.''
   Holly Farms had sales of $1.6 billion last year and net income
of $36.2 million, or $2.06 a share. In the first quarter of this
year, Holly Farms reported sales of $504.2 million and net income
of $29.8 million, or $1.65 per share.
   Tyson, 58, son of the company's founder, is a bearded, balding
cannonball of a man, wears a tan uniform on the job, the same type
of clothing worn by his workers. The company's orange and yellow
logo is on the uniform, along with his name.
   ``If we had suits on, we might not go out in the chicken house
or the feed mill or the processing plant,'' Tyson told the
Associated Press in a 1985 interview.
   Forbes magazine this week listed Tyson as the 245th wealthiest
U.S. resident, with an estimated net worth of $330 million.

   Sundstrand Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to
fraud charges brought after a federal investigation revealed the
company had been overbilling the Defense Department for airplane
parts, authorities said today.
   Sundstrand has agreed to pay a $115 million settlement, the
largest single fraud settlement in history, U.S. Attorney Anton
Valukas said at a news conference.
   ``What you have, in a sense, is a tragedy,'' Valukas said. ``You
have a company that set out to defraud the government.
   ``The only way that type of activity can be deterred is through
swift legal action,'' he said.
   Sundstrand spokesman Claude Vernam was not immediately available
for comment, said a secretary in his Rockford office who would
identify herself only as Karen.
   Rockford-based Sundstrand makes flight-data equipment, engine
startup systems and other electronic equipment for military and
commercial aircraft.
   The Pentagon accounts for 42 percent of the company's $1.4
billion in annual sales.
   Valukas would not comment on a published report that the
aerospace contractor could be suspended for a time from doing
business with the Defense Department.
   The company agreed to plead guilty to a four-count criminal
information that accused Sundstrand of overcharging the Department
of Defense from 1981 through 1985 and concealing millions of
dollars in cost overruns on design-and-development contracts,
officials said.
   The company also was accused of conspiring to undermine the
contract-bidding process by spending more than $100,000 to provide
Department of Defense personnel with liquor, meals, theater tickets
and other amenities in a bid to gain greater access to them.
   ``Sundstrand has provided a good-quality product for a long
period of time. Unfortunately, we've been paying too much for it,''
Francis Holland, regional commander of Defense Contract
Administration Services, said at the news conference.
   In its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
earlier this year, Sundstrand said the ``government has advised
that it intends to charge the company with criminal violations'' in
Rockford and Seattle. Sunstrand operates a subsidiary, part of its
Advanced Technology Group, in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle.
   Sundstrand's SEC filing said the company was ``in the process of
entering a settlement in one or possibly both actions.''
   It added that settlements ``could result in the imposition of
materially adverse fines and penalties.''
   Sundstrand reported in a 1987 financial filing that the
government was seeking repayment of $13.5 million plus interest and
$102.9 million plus interest in two separate disputes over contract
pricing.
   The company began putting money in reserve two years ago to
cover settlement and legal expenses resulting from the dispute.
   Business Week reported last month that Sundstrand could face
possible suspension by the Defense Department.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London stock exchange finished
a jittery session sharply lower Wednesday, pulled down by sinking
prices on Wall Street.
   The markets were battered by rumors that U.S. trade figures for
August, due j5w Thursday, could show a significant widening in the
country's trade gap.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 24
points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,814.3, near its worst level for the
session of 1,811.8. The index opened at its highest point, down 7.1
points.
   Volume was modest, as 475.9 million shares changed hands,
compared with the 462.9 million shares traded Tuesday.
   Dealers said the market came unglued by Wall Street's overall
decline, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping as much as
25 points within the first 15 minutes of trading.
   By the close of trading in London, the average was 30.23 points
lower at 2,126.24.
   Attention focused squarely on the U.S. trade figures, which are
expected to show a widening of the trade deficit in August to $11.3
billion from July's $9.5 billion, according to several economists.
   But market watchers suggested that the shortfall could surge to
as much as $15 billion.

<HEAD>Walgreen Announces Haft Family Purchase Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walgreen Co. said today the Haft family, which
already has a bid outstanding for supermarket owner Kroger Co., is
seeking federal permission to acquire at least $15 million of the
drug retailer's stock.
   Walgreen, the nation's largest drugstore chain, also reported a
22 percent increase in its fourth-quarter net income and a 25
percent profit gain for the 1988 fiscal year.
   The Hafts applied for federal clearance to purchase the Walgreen
stock, the retailer said in a statement. Walgreen, based in
Deerfield, Ill., north of Chicago, said it did not know how much,
if any, Walgreen stock the Hafts already own.
   ``We will monitor the Haft situation carefully and take all
actions necessary to protect the company and its shareholders,''
said Chairman Charles R. Walgreen III.
   Neither the Hafts nor their company, Dart Group Corp., would
comment today on any plans regarding Walgreen.
   Walgreen stock rose $1.37{ a share to $34 in New York Stock
Exchange trading after today's announcement.
   The Hafts, based in Landover, Md., sold Dart's discount
drugstore chain in 1984. Since then, the family has said they want
to acquire and operate another retailing company, but they have a
string of unsuccessful takeover bids behind them that have cast
doubt on their sincerity.
   Last month, Dart chairman Herbert Haft and his son, company
president Robert Haft, offered to buy Kroger for $55 a share, or a
total of about $4.32 billion. The status of the bid was in doubt
after the New York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc.
withdrew a $5.03 billion offer for Kroger.
   The Hafts offered last week to help Kroger fight the Kohlberg
bid by proposing to provide additional equity for Kroger's
previously-announced restructuring.
   Robert Haft reiterated Tuesday the family ``remains interested
in working with Kroger to strengthen the company and enhance their
restructuring by providing additional equity.''
   He declined to comment on whether the Haft offer for Kroger was
withdrawn.
   The Hafts have bid unsuccessfully in the past for retailers
including Stop & Shop Cos., Safeway Stores Inc. and Supermarkets
General Corp. However, they have made millions of dollars in
profits from the sale of their stock in their targets, and have
been labeled corporate raiders in the process.
   In its earnings report today, Walgreen said it had net income of
$31.9 million, or 52 cents a share for the three months ending Aug.
31, compared with $26.2 million, or 42 cents a share, for the
fourth quarter a year ago.
   Sales during the period increased to $1.2 billion from $1.1
billion.
   For the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, Walgreen reported net income
of $129.1 million, or $2.10 a share, compared with $103.5 million,
or $1.68 a share, in fiscal 1987.
   Sales in fiscal 1988 totaled $4.9 billion, up from $4.3 billion
in fiscal 1987.
   Walgreen has 1,400 Walgreen's drugstores in 29 states.

<HEAD>EEC Probing Ford, Others In Spare Parts Antitrust Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
Commission said Wednesday it has resumed an inquiry into alleged
anticompetitive practices in the spare parts market by Ford Motor
Co.'s British subsidiary and other car makers based on a court
ruling last week.
   The European Court of Justice said two car makers, Sweden's AB
Volvo of Sweden and Renault of France, could refuse licenses to
spare parts makers if they did not abuse this power of refusal.
   On Wednesday, the EEC Commission said its probe must show if
Ford and others, which it did not name, engaged in ``abusive
practices'' violating EEC antitrust rules.
   The court said illegal practices included arbitrary refusal to
supply spare parts, charging unfair prices or not making parts for
models that were still on the road in large numbers.
   The EEC's inquiry was begun several years ago following
complaints by independent spare parts makers that car makers used
their copyright and design rights to prevent them from making and
selling components.
   The Commission threatened to sue Ford U.K. Ltd. in 1985 after a
complaint by British spare parts makers but suspended its action
when Ford agreed to change some of its practices.
   Investigation of the substance of the complaint against Ford is
continuing, the Commission said.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Lower Expectations By Plant Managers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plant managers' expectations for increased
orders and overall demand in the current quarter declined for the
second period in a row, but their longer-term outlook remains
strong, a survey showed Wednesday.
   The quarterly plant-managers survey done by Dun & Bradstreet
Corp. showed modest declines in the key indexes of expected
production, new orders and demand for the last three months of the
year. Similar declines were reported in the survey about
expectations for the June-September quarter.
   But for the next 12 months, the survey showed, plant managers
believe production, new orders and overall demand will sustain
their underlying strength, although many respondents are worried
about inflation.
   ``The bottom line is that expectations have moderated to more
sustainable levels after a dramatic surge earlier this year,'' said
Joseph W. Duncan, Dun & Bradstreet's corporate economist and chief
statistician.
   The survey asks 1,500 manufacturing plant managers about their
views on existing and expected conditions in their factories,
including production levels, new orders, costs and prices, as well
as their perception of overall demand in their industry.
   Dun & Bradstreet is the world's leading marketer of business
information and related services, with worldwide revenue of $3.4
billion in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Wick Temple, director of human resources for The
Associated Press since 1985, has been appointed director of
newspaper membership, and D. Byron Yake has been named to replace
him, AP President Louis D. Boccardi announced Wednesday.
   Temple, 50, succeeds James W. Mangan, who is retiring effective
Jan. 1 after a 36-year career with the news cooperative. Yake, 48,
has been assistant to the president.
   Before taking over AP personnel and labor policies, Temple had
been managing editor for four years and sports editor for seven. He
joined the AP in Little Rock, Ark., in 1959, later serving as
correspondent in St. Louis and as chief of the Helena, Mont., and
Seattle bureaus, before moving to AP headquarters in New York in
1973. He is a vice president of the cooperative.
   Mangan, 60, has directed AP sales to the U.S. newspaper industry
since 1978, a decade of expansion in the cooperative's membership.
It now stands at a record high of 1,467 newspapers.
   He joined the AP in San Francisco in 1952, transferring to New
York in 1954 to supervise the AP World Service news report to
Europe, Africa and Asia. In 1963, he moved to Dallas as assistant
chief of bureau. One of his assignments there: coverage of the last
speech John F. Kennedy made, in Fort Worth, before the Dallas
motorcade in which he was assassinated.
   He became chief of bureau in New Orleans in 1965, returned to
Dallas as bureau chief in 1969, and later served a year as chief of
the bureau in Frankfurt, West Germany. Mangan, an AP vice

   First Boston Inc. on Wednesday reported
marginally higher profits for the third quarter as fixed-income
operations kept pace despite difficult market conditions.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the investment firm reported net
income of $41.7 million, or $1.12 a share, up 2 percent from $40.8
million, or $1.15 a share a year ago.
   Revenue during the period totaled $374.9 million, up 1 percent
from $369.6 million a year ago.
   First Boston announced on Sunday that it has agreed to merge
with Credit Suisse First Boston, its European affiliate. The
combined firm will be taken private in a deal valued at about $1.1
billion.
   Peter T. Buchanan, First Boston's president and chief executive
officer, noted that the government securities and high-yield bond
departments led the fixed-income group.
   Revenue from principal transactions, which include fixed-income
operations, more than doubled to $142.8 million, from $66.2 million
in the year-ago period.
   Buchanan also noted that the firm's financial advisory and
merger and acquisition activity ``maintained its momentum'' despite
what he termed ``difficult market conditions.''
   Still, investment banking revenues slipped to $175.1 million
from $240.8 million in the third quarter of 1987. Commission
revenue also declined during the period, to $40 million, from $46
million a year ago.
   For the year to date, First Boston reported net income of $127.3
million, or $3.42 a share, up 2 percent from $103.8 million, or
$2.95 a share in the year-ago period. Revenue during the first nine
months totaled $1.08 billion, up 2 percent from $1.06 billion a
year ago.

   Stock prices suffered a broad setback today as
traders uneasily awaited Thursday's monthly report on the nation's
international trade position.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 27.38 points to
2,129.09 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 7 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 305 up,
1,142 down and 422 unchanged.
   The day began amid widespread talk that the nation's trade
deficit for August, due to be reported Thursday by the Commerce
Department, would be larger than previously expected.
   That conjecture contributed to weakness in the dollar in foreign
exchange, and interest rates rose in the credit markets.
   Analysts also said there was some disappointment among traders
over the market's inability to extend the rally that carried the
Dow Jones industrial average to its highest closing level of the
year on Monday.
   Motorola fell 3\ to 39] in active trading. Brokers said the
company's third quarter earnings of 67 cents a share, up from 54
cents in the like period last year, disappointed investors.
   Elsewhere among the volume leaders, Exxon lost | to 45;
International Business Machines | to 118[; General Electric | to
43[, and American Telephone & Telegraph \ to 26|.
   Shared Medical Systems dropped 1\ to 15{ in the over-the-counter
market. The company said its results for the second half and 1988
as a whole are likely to below expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.87 to 154.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.58 at 301.79.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 111.92 million shares with two

<HEAD>Attorneys for Nathan Horton Family Don't Expect Cigarette Trial
Until Spring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A $17 million wrongful death suit filed by
a cancer victim's family against the maker of Pall Mall cigarettes
probably won't be scheduled for retrial until next spring at the
earliest, the plaintiffs' attorney predicts.
   Circuit Judge Gray Evans of Greenwood probably will st the
second trial date soon _ now that the Mississippi Supreme Court has
refused to rule on issues in the case before it is heard by a
second jury, attorney Don Barrett said in a telephone interview
Wednesday from his Lexington office.
   Barrett represents the family of now-deceased Nathan Henry
Horton of Durant in a case against American Tobacco Co., the maker
of Pall Malls, and New Deal Tobacco and Candy Co. of Greenwood, a
local cigarette distributor. The first Circuit Court trial in
Lexington, which attracted dozens of Wall Street analysts and
national news media, ended Jan. 29 in a hung jury.
   ``We hope it's real soon,'' Barrett said of the second trial
date. ``We've had a problem of course with the death of one of our
circuit judges, Arthur Clarke, so Judge Evans is really snowed
under and the Horton family understands that. But we believe he'll
give us a setting as soon as his schedule will permit.''
   National anti-smoking advocates had hailed the first Horton
trial as a chance to ruin cigarette manufacturers' long string of
victories in cases seeking damages for cancer victims who smoke.
Horton died of cancer on Jan. 26, 1987, and his family contends the
two packs of Pall Mall cigarettes he smoked each day for 35 years
caused his death.
   Since the hung jury in Lexington, a federal court jury in New
Jersey held a cigarette company partially responsible for the 1984
death of Rose Cipollone and awarded $400,000 in damages to her
widower, Antonio Cipollone.
   Barrett said the New Jersey case ``may be psychologically
important'' in the Horton retrial. However, he added, ``We're going
to win our case on the evidence we present.''
   Attorneys for the tobacco company have repeatedly said they
won't comment on any aspect of the pending case.
   The Mississippi Supreme Court, without a written opinion,
refused on Sept. 21 to hear an appeal filed by Horton's family. The
plaintiffs had wanted the high court to rule on 15 legal issues in
the case before it went to a second trial.
   One of the main issues the high court was asked to determine is
whether the Horton family can introduce evidence of advertising
they contend might have encouraged Horton's smoking habit.
   Defense attorneys wanted the state Supreme Court to decide
whether federal tobacco labeling laws warning of health risks would
make the advertising arguments moot.
   Horton's family counters that he began smoking the cigarettes in
1955, 10 years before the U.S. Surgeon General required a warning
label on cigarette packages. However, they say the cigarette maker
knew then that its product was harmful and addictive.

   EMI Co., a ductile iron foundry with projected

Charterhouse Group International and Hitachi Metals International.
   EMI, which has 280 employees, is a supplier of castings,
manifolds and transmission cases for heavy-duty truck and
off-highway equipment.
   The purchase price was not disclosed.
   Kurt Van Vlandren, spokesman for the new owners, said there will
be no layoffs at the Erie plant and there are ``preliminary plans
being looked at to expand the facility.''
   President George Metcalf and five other officers of EMI Co. are
partners with Charterhouse Group International and Hitachi Metals
International in the venture, Van Vlandren said.
   Charterhouse Group International, headquartered in New York, is
owned by five European financial companies, Chairman Merril M.
Halpern and President Jerome L. Katz. A subsidiary last year
acquired Carpenter Enterprises, a supplier of machined components
to the same truck and off-highway equipment markets.
   Hitachi Metals International is a subsidiary of Hitachi Metals
Limited of Tokyo, Japan, and owns the largest independent ductile
iron foundry in Japan.

   European Economic Community budget
Commissioner Henning Christophersen said Wednesday the 1989 draft
budget would be some 2 billion European currency units, or $2.26
billion, less than initial projections.
   He said the revised budget would be presented to the European
Parliament, which must approve it, and to the decision-making EEC
Council in early November.
   Christophersen said about 1 billion Ecus could be cut from the
budget ``mainly due to higher world market prices for cereals and
oilseeds.''
   He added that ``the 1988 budget is likely to produce a surplus
of another (one) billion Ecus due to a growth-induced increase in
customs duties and the effect of applying the new budget discipline
rules.''
   The new budget discipline rules are the guidelines on
agricultural expenditure, fixed by the 12 EEC heads of state at the
Brussels summit in February.
   Next year, farm expenditure is set at $27.7 billion Ecus.

<HEAD>Georgia Pacific's Third-Quarter Earnings Down Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp., a leading maker of plywood
and other forest products, announced a small decline in
third-quarter earnings Wednesday because of weak prices and higher
interest costs from a stock-buyback program.
   Earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $114
million vs. $118 million a year earlier. Earnings per share,
however, totaled $1.19 vs. $1.10, the Atlanta-based company said.
   The rise in earnings per share was due to the smaller number of
shares outstanding from the stock buyback, which left the total
number outstanding at 95.32 million in the latest quarter vs.
107.56 million a year earlier.
   Sales for the latest quarter totaled $2.4 billion, down
marginally from the $2.42 billion a year earlier.
   T. Marshall Hahn Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said
the company's overall business was sound, reflecting healthy demand
for pulp and paper products, but he said earnings were affected by
weak plywood and lumber prices.
   He also attributed the lower third-quarter earnings to ``higher
interest costs associated with debt incured to finance our share
repurchase program and acquisitions.''
   For the first nine months of the year, earnings totaled $338
million, down 2.3 percent from the $346 million earned in the
comparable year-earlier period. Per-share earnings totaled $3.41
vs. $3.16, which the company attributed to the lower number of
shares outstanding.
   Nine-month sales totaled $6.94 billion, up 9 percent from $6.37
billion in the year-earlier period.

<TEXT>
   Authorities have sniffed out what they
say is a major perfume counterfeiting ring that made millions by
slapping look-a-like labels on phony bottles of Giorgio, Chanel,
Jean Patou and Christian Dior perfumes.
   Investigators served search warrants in recent weeks at a
Fontana printing plant and a bottling firm in Indio, both east of
Los Angeles, and on a home in Milpitas, in the San Francisco area.
An undisclosed number of empty perfume bottles, boxes and other
evidence were seized, officials said Tuesday.
   ``No arrests have been made, so I wouldn't say it's been brought
to justice yet. But obviously, it's a counterfeiting ring that has
been interrupted,'' said Lt. Mike Stodelle of the San Bernardino
County Sheriff's Department.
   ``This is the largest (perfume) counterfeit operation in the
country, possibly the world,'' said Jacqueline Cohen, spokeswoman
for Giorgio Beverly Hills, who estimated that $20 million in fake
perfume was sold.
   Ms. Cohen said the company has been investigating the ring for
two years after one of the phony perfumes came to the attention of
its security director.
   The perfumes were sold around the country at retail outlets not
authorized by the companies and at flea markets, said Ms. Cohen.
   Additional details about the search warrants weren't released
and Stodelle refused to identify the people or companies named,
saying the investigation was continuing.

   Grain futures closed mostly higher while soybean
futures finished mostly lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade in light, cautious trading ahead of the government's revised
crop production report.
   ``It was very quiet all the way around,'' said Walter Spilka, a
grain analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   Soybean prices were pressured by expectations that the
Agriculture Department would project a larger soybean crop than the
1.47 billion bushels it predicted in last month's report, due to
better-than-expected yields in the advancing harvest.
   But little change was expected in the USDA's September corn
production estimate of 4.46 billion bushels.
   The report, issued shortly after the close, pegged soybean
production at 1.5 billion bushels and corn production at 4.55
billion bushels.
   Those numbers compare with 1987 production of 1.9 billion
bushels of soybeans and 7.1 billion bushels of corn.
   Both corn and wheat futures prices were boosted by indications
of increased export business, Spilka said. Wheat for December,
March and May deliveries hit new life-of-contract highs.
   At the close, wheat was \ cent lower to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.34{ a bushel; corn was {

soybeans were 4{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with November at

<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. reported its
profit rose 22 percent in the third quarter partly because of
improved results in its casino operations.
   Hilton said Wednesday it earned $27.2 million, or 57 cents a
share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $22.3 million, or 44
cents a share, a year ago. Sales totaled $236.1 million, up 19
percent from $198.2 million a year earlier.
   Gambling revenue nearly doubled, jumping to $33.1 million from
$18.5 million in the 1987 third quarter. The gain was partly due to
better results at Hilton's Nevada casinos and to the company's
interest in the Conrad International hotel-casino in Queensland,
Australia.
   Operating revenue in the hotel sector declined 12 percent to $21
million. The drop was largely due to a one-time credit that boosted
revenue in the 1987 quarter and a charge for taxes that depressed
the figure for the latest quarter, said Roy Judge, a vice president
and assistant to the chairman.
   Hilton said hotel occupancy increased to 71 percent, from 70
percent a year ago, while Nevada gaming occupancy reached 90
percent, against 83 percent in 1987.
   For the year to date, profit rose 17 percent to $95.7 million,
or $1.99 a share, from $81.5 million, or $1.62 a share. Revenue in
the nine-month period totaled $699.2 million, up 12 percent from
$623.4 million.

<HEAD>Whirlpool Third Quarter Earnings Down 29.3 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Appliance maker Whirlpool Corp.
reported a 29.4 percent drop in third quarter earnings Wednesday,
primarily because of the higher costs of materials.
   The company said it earned $31.5 million, or 45 cents per share,
on sales of $1.2 billion in the July-September period this year,
compared with $44.6 million, or 63 cents per share, on $1.1 billion
in sales during the same three months last year.
   The third-quarter sales, up 5.4 percent from the third quarter
of 1987, set a company record, and were attributed to increases in
shipments of Whirlpool's KitchenAid and Kenmore products.
   During the third quarter of 1988, Whirlpool announced some price
increases and acquired Emerson Electric Co.'s dishwasher and trash
compactor manufacturing business.
   For the first nine months of the year, Whirlpool earned $106.1
million, or $1.53 per share, on sales of $3.4 billion. During the
July-September period last year, the company earned $151.5 million,
or $2.09 a share, on sales of $3.2 billion.
   Whirlpool said the drop in third quarter earnings and the 30
percent decline so far this year was due largely to higher material
prices not covered by price increases.
   A weak kitchen-cabinet business and a $10.8 million addition to
the 1987 figures because of an accounting change also played roles
in the earnings weakness this year, the company said.

<HEAD>World Oil Glut Prompts Budget Cuts in Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The plunge in prices for oil, Mexico's
leading export, has prompted the government to announce painful
budget cuts, consider an International Monetary Fund contingency
loan and renew calls for a better deal on the foreign debt.
   It also highlights a stubborn battle against inflation and an
ambitious trade liberalization program meant to diversify Mexico's
export earnings and wean the nation from dependence on
oil-generated revenues.
   Pemex, the government oil monopoly, said on Oct. 7 that average
spot market prices for Mexican crude had sunk to about $9 a barrel
and that revenues for this year would fall below 1987's $8.6
billion.
   Last year, oil accounted for 41 percent of total Mexican export
revenues and helped the country post an overall $8.4 billion trade
surplus.
   Reacting to the drop in oil-based earnings _ estimated by one
Energy Department official at $2 billion below official projections
so far this year _ President Miguel de la Madrid's administration
announced more than $200 million in budget cuts last Friday.
   The administration took pains to assure Mexicans, whose
paychecks are worth half what they were in 1982, that the cuts
would spare social programs.
   ``We can manage the problems (caused by falling oil prices) with
some sacrifices,'' Agustin F. Legorreta, president of the private
Business Coordinating Council, said Tuesday.
   The falling price of oil has spurred new calls for renegotiation
of Mexico's $104 billion foreign debt. Legorreta said interest
payments on the debt are sucking funds away from economic
development.
   The government has been using its foreign reserves to support a
7-month-old peso currency exchange rate freeze as part of an
anti-inflation wage and price stabilization program. If the price
of oil keeps dropping, however, the government may actually be
forced to add to the debt burden.
   Most analysts believe the government when it says inflation is
its No. 1 economic priority and say President-elect Carlos Salinas
de Gortari will try to maintain the fight. Salinas takes office
Dec. 1.
   ``The danger of hyperinflation is so big that the effort should
continue,'' said Jacobo Zaidenweber, president of the Mexico-United
States Chamber of Commerce, in a recent interview. ``It could take
between one and three years in one form or another.''
   Under terms of a 1987 foreign debt rescheduling agreement with
the IMF, Mexico has the option to draw up to $1.2 billion in
contingency loans if the price of crude oil drops below the $9
barrier.
   Hard currecny reserves, which reached a high of $16 billion in
April, dropped to an estimated $12 billion in July as the
government propped up the peso against the dollar.
   The government has resisted fresh calls to devalue and give
Mexican entrepreneurs a new export advantage that could help offset
the shrinking trade surplus. A devaluation would generate new
inflationary pressures; the anti-inflation plan has, officially,
reduced annualized inflation from a record 159.2 percent in 1987 to
about 45 percent this year.
   Although resisting the calls to devalue, the administration has
stressed the importance of non-oil exports to make up for the
shortfall in oil revenues.
   Through June, Mexico's first-half merchandise trade surplus
totalled $2.4 billion, well below 1987's first-half surplus of
$4.76 billion, according to the Center for Private Sector Economic
Studies. But non-petroleum exports, at $7.1 billion, were up 20
percent over the same period in 1987.
   However, the surplus was hurt when merchandise imports surged by
53 percent between January and June to $8.3 billion. That was
encouraged by trade liberalization aimed at forcing domestic
industry to become competitive and lower prices.
   On Monday, Tomas Rodriguez Weber, director general of Capital
Goods and Petrochemical Industries affairs at the Commerce
Department, reiterated the government's position that
manufacturers' exports are the best way to compensate for the weak
oil sector.

system is one of the least understood yet most important aspects of
last October's historic plunge.
   In human terms, the crisis sprang from a loss of faith that
participants in the market would honor their commitments. Markets
are founded on that belief and cannot function without it.
   The stock market depends on the banking system because every
trade involves money passing from a seller's bank to a buyer's.
Banks also provide lines of credit for investors.
   Instead of making fresh loans during the crash, some big New
York banks actually demanded more collateral on existing loans from
desperate customers that had to meet margin calls.
   Only decisive action by the Federal Reserve prevented the banks'
response from triggering a wave of defaults that could have ushered
in a full-fledged panic.
   A year later, in spite of numerous studies, little has been done
to rebuild the financial system so the next stock market collapse
does not bring the circulation of money to a deadly standstill.
   ``All financial panics result from the withdrawal of credit by
the banks. It's the grease in the engine, and the engine seizes up
without it,'' said Martin Mayer, a veteran banking writer.
   The survival of the markets through Black Monday proved the
financial system can withstand a major shock, but a bit of luck was
involved.
   If the crash had occurred one week earlier, banks and the money
transfer wires would have been closed for Columbus Day. Traders
would have piled up huge debts with no way to pay them.
   ``It would have been horrendous. The system would not have
worked. It would have stopped,'' said Paul Allen, a partner in the
consulting firm of McKinsey & Co.
   To a degree, the banks' caution on lending last year is
understandable: Banks have a duty to both federal regulators and
their own shareholders not to throw money away on loans that will
not be repaid.
   Complicating credit decisions last year were deficiencies in the
back offices _ the operations that work out who owes what to whom
and then carry out deliveries of securities and payments for them.
   These back offices, known as clearing and settlement systems,
have grown haphazardly into a disjointed network that is unsuited
for a world of global trading and tightly interconnected markets.
   A clearing and settlement network consists of organizations that
help stock exchanges sort out the terms of a trade and then make
the swap by taking in the securities from the seller and the
payment from the buyer. If one side or the other defaults, the
system is supposed to make good on the deal.
   In spite of safeguards, some regulators feared last October that
a single default in the back offices could have set off a chain
reaction of defaults.
   The worriers included New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan,
who many regard as a hero of the crash because he oversaw the Fed's
emergency lending and arm-twisted bankers into supplying credit to
financial institutions.
   The possibility of a major default in one of the clearing and
settlement systems was ``the greatest threat to the stability of
the financial system as a whole in that period,'' Corrigan said
last May.
   Most proposed reforms have dealt with highly visible matters _
an express lane for individual investors, coordinated circuit
breakers for stocks and futures.
   Far less attention has been paid to clearing and settlement, the
invisible side of the financial system.
   ``It's not a subject that people have considered sexy. It is
sexy. You're talking about well over a trillion dollars a day,''
said Mayer, the banking writer and author of a new book,
``Markets.''
   Each of the major exchanges has its own system for clearing and
settling, and each system has different rules. The fragmentation
was acceptable when Chicago stuck to beans and bellies, but it does
not work in the era of index arbitrage, when traders simultaneously
do business in multiple markets.
   Delays in settlement keep traders guessing about whether their
sales and purchases will actually go through. It takes five days to
be paid for stocks sold on the New York Stock Exchange. Some
foreign exchanges take months.
   Changes are coming, but slowly. The NYSE says it will not reduce
the lag in payment and delivery from five days until sometime in
the next decade.
   The irony is that settlement problems could push a customer into
default even if it had plenty of money coming to it, a point made
by the presidential task force in its post mortem on the crash.
   The fragility of the settlement system is worsened by a practice
known as ``daylight overdrafting,'' in which banks cash checks for
big customers or other banks before the money to cover the checks
has arrived.
   These overdrafts are huge, a fact that becomes apparent only
when something goes wrong. In November 1986, the Bank of New York
had to take out an emergency overnight loan of $26 billion from the
Federal Reserve because of a computer bug.
   ``The real issue is, what you've got is risk piled on top of
risk,'' said McKinsey's Allen.
   Global trading is exacerbating the problem. Big U.S. banks
routinely shut down for the night with giant holes in their books
because they have not received money from abroad to cover
overdrafts.
   Theoretically, a major default overseas could knock out a U.S.
bank while all its officers were asleep.
   Although the 1987 stock market crash began in the United States,
the next one could well start in Japan or Europe. Or a big
institution could fail for reasons unrelated to a stock crash _ as
Continental Illinois Bank nearly did in 1984.
   Americans say the European clearing and settlement systems are
one place trouble could start. The two biggest European systems
handle a combined $90 billion a week but, unlike their U.S.
counterparts, don't guarantee that the parties to a trade will
fulfill their obligations.
   ``There are few institutions that seem to monitor and are fully
aware of that type of risk,'' said Abraham Gulkowitz, senior vice
president for credit policy at Bankers Trust Co.
   The Federal Reserve is cutting back on the size of overdrafts
banks are allowed to make. But since global markets are here to
stay, the long-term solution is for banks to stay open around the
clock.
   In the end, there is a danger that the market's survival through
Black Monday will create a false sense of security, leading
bankers, brokers and traders to believe that reforms are not needed
because the Federal Reserve will always be there to bail the system
out.

   Here are some changes in the clearing and
settlement system that would reduce the likelihood that another
stock market crash will send the financial system into gridlock:
   SPEED UP SETTLEMENTS. Delayed settlements tie up money and keep
traders exposed to risks. The New York Stock Exchange has said it
recognizes the problem and will move by 1990 to two-day clearing _
that is, straightening out who owes what to whom. However,
settlement will continue to take places five days after trading
until sometime later in the 1990s.
   KEEP BANKS OPEN. Banks need to move to around-the-clock
operations so they can meet the needs of financial institutions
that do business at all hours. This will reduce risks and keep
banking business from moving to foreign banks.
   REDUCE OVERDRAFTS. Customers should have to pay for the
privilege of getting cash from a bank before the money to cover the
withdrawal has been deposited. This should discourage overdrafts
and reduce the vulnerability of banks to defaults.
   UPDATE LAWS. Revise the federal bankruptcy code and other laws
so they treat stocks, futures and options more consistently. For
example, banks should have clear rights to obtain liens on put
options that are pledged as collateral.
   PERMIT CROSS-MARGINING. With changes in laws, exchanges would be
freer to allow traders to pledge assets in one market as collateral
against liabilities in another _ for example, put options against
stocks. This would help traders with hedged positions and ease the
selling pressure in a falling market. The Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Options Clearing Corp. plan to allow cross-margining
next year.
   IMPROVE EQUIPMENT. Make sure computers and communication systems
are secure and have back-ups. Many observers feel the sense of
panic on Oct. 20 was heightened when the Fedwire, which handles
money transfers between banks, briefly failed.
   LOOK OVERSEAS. U.S. authorities should take the lead in
improving the security and efficiency of foreign clearing and
settlement systems. In today's interlocked markets, a major default
in a system overseas would quickly affect the United States.

   An official of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International accused of participating in a $32 million
international drug money-laundering ring surrendered to British
customs agents Wednesday, officials said.
   Nazir Chinoy, 55, a senior executive in the Paris office of the
international banking group, was turned over to police and appeared
later in Bow Street Magistrate's Court where he was ordered held in
custody pending a court appearance Friday. His attorney, Roger
Bevan, did not seek bail.
   Chinoy, a native of Bombay, India, who keeps an apartment in an
exclusive section of west London's Bayswater area, is wanted under
a United States arrest warrant alleging he conspired between May
1986 and October 1988 to possess cocaine in Florida and elsewhere.
   A Customs and Excise Department spokesman said Chinoy was in
London for a business meeting Tuesday when U.S. officials unsealed
indictments against 85 defendants in what federal agents called the
first drug-related money-laundering case involving a global
financial institution.
   The indictments named nine banking officials and the
Luxembourg-based bank holding company, BCCI Holdings, which has
branches in 72 countries. Also named were two subsidiaries, Bank of
Credit and Commerce International S.A. and Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (Overseas) Limited.
   U.S. Customs officials said the indictments stem from a two-year
undercover investigation into a money-laundering ring that routed
drug profits through the banks to Colombian cocaine cartels.
   The United States has not yet formally filed papers seeking
Chinoy's extradition, but has 60 days to do so, officials said.
   At least 40 people have been arrested worldwide in connection
with the case. Indictments were returned in Tampa, New York,
Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and Houston, and warrants were
issued in Miami, Los Angeles, London and Paris.

   Stock prices showed a broad loss today as
traders uneasily awaited Thursday's monthly report on the nation's
international trade position.
   The day began amid widespread talk that the nation's trade
deficit for August, due to be reported Thursday by the Commerce
Department, would be larger than previously expected.
   That conjecture contributed to weakness in the dollar in foreign
exchange, and interest rates rose in the credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell more than $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   Analysts also said there was some disappointment among traders
over the market's inability to extend the rally that carried the
Dow Jones industrial average to its highest closing level of the
year on Monday.

   Clarence Thomas, chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, on Wednesday criticized a
General Accounting Office report that said the EEOC did not fully
investigate as many as 80 percent of job discrimination claims over
a three-month period last year.
   In a statement, Thomas said the report by GAO, an investigative
arm of Congress, ``trivializes civil rights enforcement to a level
commensurate with widget making. It's politically motivated, highly
misleading and deficient in several major regards.''
   Thomas criticized the GAO report for failing to note
improvements in EEOC's program and its successes in civil rights
enforcement; conducting a limited, overly mechanical study that
ignored the complexities of civil rights enforcement; and
recommending old ideas for improvement and disregarding initiatives
implemented by EEOC.
   ``EEOC's recent unprecedented success in comparison to the
agency's past record was virtually ignored by GAO in this report,''
said Thomas. ``We have investigated more charges, filed more
lawsuits and obtained more tangible benefits for victims of
unlawful discrimination than any previous commission.''
   He said the report's ``inaccurate and misleading findings impugn
the reputations of many career civil servants and undermine the
progress we have made as a civil rights enforcement agency.
   ``We have buttressed our strengths,'' Thomas said. ``We have
acknowledged our weaknesses and taken steps to correct them. Our
program is working.''
   In its report, released Tuesday by Rep. Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, GAO
said the stated policy of EEOC since 1983 has been to ``fully
investigate'' charges of violation of federal, state and local
anti-employment discrimination laws.
   GAO reviewed investigations of charges closed between January
through March 1987 in which no evidence of discrimination was
found. The investigators said 41 percent to 82 percent of the
charges closed by the six EEOC district offices and 40 percent to
87 percent of charges closed by five state agencies were not fully
investigated.
   Hawkins, who asked for the study, said: ``I find it outrageous
that there are people across the country who may have a legitimate
job discrimination claim denied because the EEOC mishandled the
case, didn't enforce the law and was more concerned with reducing
paperwork than with protecting claimants' civil rights.''
   Thomas said GAO acknowledged it has a lack of expertise in
evaluating evidence to determine whether discrimination had
occurred.
   ``GAO has a fundamental lack of understanding of the
investigatory and judicial principles of witness credibility,
evidence and burdens of proof inherent in civil rights
enforcement,'' he said. ``GAO refused to seek clarification of the
evaluation standards used by EEOC and ignored our attempts to
define those standards.
   ``A full investigation is that amount of investigation required
to make a sound determination on the merits of the charge,'' said
Thomas. ``It is nothing more and nothing less.''

<HEAD>Bank Of England Scales Down Size Of British Banknotes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tourists will find it easier to tuck British
banknotes into their wallets in a few years as the present series
of large, unwieldy bills is replaced by smaller currency, the Bank
of England announced Wednesday.
   ``United Kingdom banknotes are quite, quite large
internationally,'' said a spokesman for England's central bank,
requesting anonymity. ``There seems some logic in reducing their
size so people can fit them into their wallets.''
   The bank's D-series notes, introduced in 1970, will be phased
out in gradual stages beginning with the introduction of a new
E-series 5-pound bill in 1990, which is the equivalent of $8.50,
and continuing with new 10-pound, 20-pound, and 50-pound bills
through 1994, the spokesman said. They are the equivalent of $17,
$34 and $85 respectively.
   The D-series notes will remain legal tender.
   Unlike the United States, where Federal Reserve notes are a
uniform size and color, British banknotes come in various
dimensions and hues.
   The blue 5-pound note, slightly larger than a U.S. dollar bill,
is dwarfed by the greenish 50-pound note, nearly the size of a page
from a paperback novel.
   The average reduction will be about 0.5 inches (or 1.27
centimeters) in length and width. The bills will remain different
sizes to help blind people distinguish between them, the spokesman
said.
   Britons carry more of the high-denomination notes than they used
to, the spokesman said. The most popular is the pink 10-pound note,
with 610 million in circulation.
   The Bank of England will save ``substantial'' paper costs by
reducing the size of the notes and producing them with advanced
printing technology, the spokesman said.
   Though final designs remain to be worked out, all the bills will
continue to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front
and a historical figure on the reverse, the spokesman said.
   The reductions in size for each bill are:
   Five-pound note, from 3 inches by 5.7 inches to 2.7 by 5.3
inches; 10-pound note, 3.34 inches by 5.94 inches to 2.95 inches by
5.6 inches; 20-pound note, 3.5 inches by 6.3 inches to 3.14 inches
by 5.86 inches; and 50-pound note, 3.7 inches by 6.65 inches to
3.34 inches by 6.14 inches.

<HEAD>Some Kroger Employees Fear Another Takeover Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kroger Co. employees are concerned that
another takeover attempt might be looming, even though a big
investment firm has withdrawn its $5.03 billion buyout bid and the
giant supermarket chain has undertaken a major defensive
restructuring.
   Employees at Kroger headquarters say they are relieved Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., which specializes in corporate takeovers,
withdrew its $64-per-share buyout offer on Tuesday. But concern
about Kroger and their jobs remains.
   ``I think we are going to make it, but it will still be tough,''
said George Aulick of Kroger's management information systems
department.
   Dart Group Inc., of Landover, Md., began the bidding for Kroger
on Sept. 19 with a $4.32 billion, $55-per-share offer. Dart has not
improved its offer but has not indicated whether it too was
withdrawing from the scene.
   To thwart both buyout offers, Kroger has undertaken a $4.6
billion corporate restructuring that includes the sale of some of
the company's stores and food processing businesses. Last week,
Kroger dismissed 300 of its approximately 800 headquarters
employees as part of the restructuring, in order to save $13
million annually.
   Aulick said he believes attempts to acquire the company will end
because Kohlberg was unsuccessful in its bid for Kroger after a
three-week effort. He noted that Kroger's stock price fell after
Kohlberg withdrew, reflecting speculation that there would be no
further buyout offers that might drive the price higher.
   Kroger's stock fell $2.62{ a share to $55 in heavy trading
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, but closed $1 higher at $56
on Wednesday.
   But Kroger headquarters employee Bruce House said he thinks
another buyout attempt probably is looming.
   ``I think attempts to take over the company will continue. The
climate is ripe for them now and Kroger is a solid company, which
makes it attractive,'' House said.
   Kroger officials say the restructuring _ which will result in a
smaller and more indebted company _ is a better deal for
shareholders than the Kohlberg offer. Kroger shareholders will get
a $40 a share special cash dividend, plus notes and stock in the
restructured company.
   A few Kroger employees were surprised, but not disappointed, by
Kohlberg's decision to withdraw.
   ``I was happy but caught off guard,'' employee Pam Wurtzler
said. ``We thought it was good the company's (Kroger) plan seems to
have worked.''
   Company employees said they have not heard whether more firings
were planned. The remaining employees are concerned about their
futures.
   ``I have mixed emotions about everything,'' House said. ``It's
been so rough the last two weeks.''
   After last week's firings, which many employees blamed on
Kohlberg's takeover attempt, there were few kind words for the
buyout specialists.
   ``They made their money, they stripped the company, they did
their damage, and now they're gone,'' Aulick said. ``I'm glad
they're gone. We're going to make it.''
   The 105-year-old Kroger has about 170,000 employees and 52,000
shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarkets
and convenience stores, with operations in 29 states.
   Kroger said Wednesday it has received Federal Trade Commission
approval to sell 24 Florida Choice supermarkets and 24 Florida
Choice liquor stores, all located in Florida, to the Kash N' Karry
firm for $55 million. The transaction is to be completed by Friday.

   The dollar fell to its lowest point since the
early summer on Wednesday, continuing a swift descent that was
blamed on nervousness about Thursday's report on the U.S. trade
deficit.
   Meanwhile, gold prices were mostly higher.
   A big deficit would indicate that the dollar needs to fall
further to erase the trade deficit by making U.S. goods cheaper in
world markets.
   Since its latest peak on Sept. 1, the dollar has fallen 6
percent against the Japanese yen, 4 percent against the British
pound and more than 3 percent against the West German mark. The
steepest slide has occurred this week.
   ``This is the first time in a long time that I've sensed the
currency markets to be as nervous as they have been in the last 48
hours,'' said Marc Cohen, a vice president for Republic National
Bank of New York.
   Some traders said the dollar might fall if the Commerce
Department reported an August trade deficit greater than $11
billion or so, compared to $9.5 billion in July.
   However, the market's reaction to trade numbers is
unpredictable. If sentiment has shifted decisively against the
dollar, even a small deficit could fail to boost the currency.
   ``It appears there had been a consensus in the market that the
dollar fundamentally should drop,'' Cohen said.
   ``There's a sense developing that we're getting to the end of
the line'' on monthly improvements in the trade deficit, said Craig
Sloane, a currency analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   The dollar began to ease in Tokyo, where trading ends before
Europe's business day begins, following Japanese Central Bank
President Satoshi Sumita's indications that he isn't too concerned
about the Japanese yen's recent strength.
   Sumita's statements, some Frankfurt dealers said, triggered
sales of billions of dollars by institutions in Japan.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 129.65 yen from 131.15
yen late Tuesday. It was the first time the dollar closed below the
130-yen level since June 24. Later, in London, it was quoted at
129.20 yen. In New York, the dollar plunged to 129.03 yen from
131.07 late Tuesday, reaching its lowest point since June 23, when
it closed at 128.55.
   Market participants said the Bank of England, repeating
Tuesday's move, came into the market Wednesday, selling modest
amounts of sterling when the currency traded at about $1.7270. But
the intervention failed to stem the dollar's fall and the pound's
rise.
   At the end of the day, it cost $1.7305 to buy one pound, more
expensive than $1.7175 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound rose to
$1.7364 from $1.7172.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8345 West German marks, down from
1.8541; 1.5491 Swiss francs, down from 1.5615; 1.2112 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2111; 6.2545 French francs, down from 6.3165;
and 1,366.63 Italian lire, down from 1,380.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8340 West German marks, down from 1.8512;
1.55865 Swiss francs, down from 1.5690; 6.2770 French francs, down
from 6.3070; 2.0760 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0850; 1,370.50
Italian lire, down from 1,379.00; and 1.21175 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2075.
   Gold prices were mostly higher. The exception was Hong Kong,
where gold prices fell $3.06 a troy ounce to close at a bid
$408.53, after rising on Tuesday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $409.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $406.25 an ounce.
   In Zurich, gold rose to a bid of $408.10 an ounce compared with
$406.00 late Tuesday.
   In New York, Republic National Bank of New York said gold was
bid at $408.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $404 late
Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $408.40 a troy ounce, up from $404.40.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market, where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.35 a troy ounce, compared
with Tuesday's $6.31. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $6.32 a troy ounce from $6.20 an ounce
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Holly Farms Will Study Tyson's Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp. said Wednesday it will
consider the nearly $900 million takeover offer from rival poultry
processor Tyson Foods Inc.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor, offered late
Tuesday to pay $45 in cash and a quarter share of its Class A
common stock for each of Holly Farms' 18.1 million outstanding
shares.
   In a brief statement Wednesday, Holly Farms said its board of
directors would study the offer. The company declined to offer any
other comment.
   ``I think Holly Farms will sell to Tyson only as a last
resort,'' said John M. McMillin, an analyst with the investment
firm Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   However, John Lawrence, an associate analyst at the investment
firm Morgan Keegan in Memphis, predicted a deal would be worked out
between the two poultry rivals.
   Holly Farms stock rose sharply in heavy trading, jumping $6.62{
a share to $49.62{ in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
Tyson fell 62{ cents a share to $17 in over-the-counter trading.
   McMillin said he estimated Holly Farms was worth at least $55 a
share, or about $6 a share higher than Tyson offered. Lawrence put
Holly Farms' value at between $50 and $55 a share.
   McMillin said Holly Farms' managers could seek a higher bid from
a third party but he speculated they might try to buy the company
themselves in a leveraged buyout.
   A leveraged buyout is financed with debt that is repaid with the
target company's cash flow or sale of assets.
   ``There's a couple of options,'' McMillin said. ``One is to look
for a white knight, which could potentially be a Phillip Morris or
a Sara Lee ... look for a company to basically choose who they want
to get married to.
   ``The other is to pursue a management-led leveraged buyout, take
the company private. I think that's what they're pursuing right
now,'' he said.
   Several hours before Tyson disclosed its offer, Holly Farms had
announced it had been approached by an unidentified company
regarding a possible business combination. Holly Farms said no
specific proposal had been received and the company did not intend
to seek one.
   The company also said it had activated its ``poison pill''
takeover defense, which is designed to make a hostile takeover
prohibitively expensive.
   Bob Justice, a spokesman at Tyson's headquarters in Springdale,
Ark., said Wednesday that Tyson had not heard from Holly Farms
about the offer.
   ``We are just waiting on whatever decision they are making over
there. We are standing by,'' he said. ``We do have a timetable of
Oct. 19. That's our deadline. Hopefully, they can make a decision
prior to that. And we feel optimistic about a response before
that.''
   McMillin said a merger would increase Tyson's share of the
national poultry market from 18 percent to 28 percent.
   Tyson produces 14 million pounds of chicken meat each week from
an operation that includes hatcheries, feed mills, processing
plants and a sophisticated marketing arm. The company sells both
whole chickens and processed products to supermarkets, fast food
chains and institutional customers.
   Tyson had revenues of about $1.8 billion in its most recent
fiscal year, with an after-tax profit of $67 million. It has 25,600
employees.
   Holly Farms is a diversified foods company, with about 50
percent of its sales concentrated in chicken. The company also
mills flour and provides other meats for the food service industry.
   Holly Farms had sales of $1.6 billion last year and net income
of $36.2 million.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Rebound But Experts Still Expect Sharp Drop</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting with correct header</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

   Precious metals futures prices rebounded Wednesday in response
to weaker bond prices and a softer dollar but analysts continued to
predict that gold would soon return to its recent lows below $400 a
troy ounce.
   On other markets, energy futures rallied sharply; livestock and
meat gained; grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index
futures retreated.
   Gold for October delivery traded as high as $409 a troy ounce on
New York's Commodity Exchange and December gold hit $416 as traders
interpreted lower bond prices and the weaker dollar as bullish
signals for the precious metals.
   But to chart-watching technical traders, those gold prices _ the
highest in three weeks _ meant the market was overbought. The
technicians sold, driving the December contract down to a close of
$412.20, although the spot contract held up well, settling at
$408.40.
   Analyst Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co. in New York, said the
bond and dollar weakness that precipitated Wednesday's gold rush
was largely based on expectations that the government would report
a widening of the U.S. trade deficit in a report due out Thursday
morning.
   Meanwhile, he said, the low inflation rate, ample gold supplies
and other factors that led to the gold market's collapse last month
remain in place.
   ``I think the market is in an overbought condition and I think
we'll test the recent lows of $390 to $395'' in the December
contract, Cardillo said.
   Gold settled $3.80 to $4.70 higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $412.20 a troy ounce; silver was 11.9 cents
to 12 cents higher with December at $6.395 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices galloped higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, paced by unleaded gasoline, which surged the
2-cents-a-gallon daily limit before late profit-taking reduced the
gains.
   Crude oil settled above $14 a barrel for the first time in two
weeks.
   The rally reflected ``a general mood of reassessment'' about the
ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
curb their crude oil production and boost prices, said Peter
Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc.
   Cardillo said the oil rally was linked to growing signs that the
cease-fire between Iran and Iraq would develop into a lasting peace.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 56 cents
higher with November at $14.11 a barrel; heating oil was 1.01 cents
to 1.76 cents higher with November at 40.84 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.40 cents to 1.95 cents higher with November
at 42.66 cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures posted strong gains due to higher cash markets
and indications of firmer demand for beef at the wholesale and
retail levels, analysts said. Pork futures gained on spillover
buying from the cattle pits.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent to 1.02 cents higher with October
at 72.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .73 cent
higher with October at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with October at 40.30 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .17 cent higher with February
at 48.05 cents a pound.
   Grain futures finished mostly higher while soybeans ended mostly
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade in light, cautious trading
ahead of the Agriculture Department's revised crop production
report.
   The report, issued shortly after the close, pegged soybean
production at 1.5 billion bushels and corn production at 4.55
billion bushels.
   Both of those estimates were higher than the USDA's September
projections, reflecting better-than-expected yields from the
ongoing harvest.
   The numbers indicated that drought damage would result in a 35
percent reduction in the corn crop from last year's 7.1 billion
bushels and a 21 percent drop in soybean production from last
year's 1.9 billion bushels.
   Analysts and traders said the report was slightly bearish for
grain and soybean prices but they did not expect a major sell-off.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if it ticks down and goes right back
up,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at
$4.34} a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $2.96\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher
with December at $2.56} a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents lower to 1
cent higher with November at $7.90\ a bushel.
   Stock-index futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of stocks on the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 3.94 points lower at 273.99.

<TEXT>
   Personal computer industry pioneer Steve
Jobs unveiled his Next computer workstation, calling it a
``university on a desktop'' during a glitzy product demonstration
on Wednesday that rivaled a Hollywood premier.
   ``This will serve not only as the latest state-of-the-art
technological tool, but as a partner in thought,'' Jobs told 3,000
people gathered at San Francisco's posh Louise M. Davies Symphony
Hall.
   ``Its performance is staggering,'' the 33-year-old co-founder of
Apple Computer Inc. said as students, industry executives and
potential software contributors wildly cheered.
   Jobs founded Next Inc. in 1985 after leaving Apple in a power
struggle with John Sculley, the chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Jobs, a college dropout, said his long-awaited computer would be
available to universities by April of next year at a price around
$6,500, about twice early estimates. It eventually will sell for
commercial use at about $10,000, but Jobs would not say when it
would be made available to the general public.
   A special laser printer, featuring the highest resolution
capabilities in the industry, will be sold along with the Next for
$2,000.
   ``This is going to be the biggest little computer in the
world,'' said Greg Stephens, an independent Santa Clara, Calif.,
software specialist.
   Stewart Alsop, the influential publisher of the P.C. Newsletter,
called the machine a ``landmark computer.''
   ``Over time, it will change the way people look at computers ...
that's the innovation here, that's what all the hype is about,''
Alsop said after the presentation.
   But Microsoft Corp.'s chairman, William H. Gates, has derided
the Next, saying it represents little in the way of innovation.
   ``What's novel about it? Is it as much of an advance as the Mac
(Apple Macintosh) was with its graphics interface? Is it marketed
to a broad enough part of the market?'' he asked, implying it was
neither.
   One thing it lacks is a color monitor, although Jobs said one
would be available in about a year.
   To those in attendance at the demonstration, the software was
the biggest innovation.
   Using its own distinctive set of symbols, the Next is easy to
program, allowing college professors, for example, to design
illustrations of complex scientific principles according to their
own needs.
   The Next uses a simplified version of Unix, the standard
operating system for advanced workstations.
   Among other things, it allowed Jobs during Wednesday's
demonstration to recreate the sounds of a thunderstorm; Martin
Luther King Jr.'s ``I Had a Dream'' speech; and a speech from John
F. Kennedy, all computer-generated.
   In an agreement also announced Wednesday, International Business
Machines Corp. has licensed the right to use the symbols and
commands developed by Next and probably will use the technology on
IBM computers that run Unix. The New York Times said last month
that IBM paid $10 million for the license.
   The agreement with IBM will solve one of Jobs' biggest problems,
getting software writers to convert programs to a single system.
This way they will be able to make sales to users of both Next and
IBM computers.
   Although the Next initially will be available only to
universities, analysts expect Jobs to aggressively move into other
markets within a few years.
   ``He's seeding for the future,'' said Bruce Lupatkin, senior
technology analyst at San Francisco-based Hambrecht & Quist Inc.
   ``There was a lot of hype and anticipation about this thing ...
and Jobs has lived up to all those expectations,'' Lupatkin added.
   One of the biggest innovations in hardware was a robot-built
streamlined printed circuit board only 1-foot square that Jobs said
packs enough power and speed to approach mainframe computer
capabilites. He called it the world's most compact circuit board, a
device which runs any computer.
   Each board is built in 20 minutes at a factory in Fremont, some
by robots with vision and others that can place up to 150 parts per
minutes, Jobs said.
   The Next comes in a black magnesium case, with a tilt-up,
17-inch screen.
   Data is stored on a device that is similar to a compact disc
player but uses a disc that can be erased and rewritten upon. Next
said the device, supplied by Canon Inc., has about 50 times the
storage capacity of competitive products.
   ``Once or twice in a decade something like this comes along and
I believe it's going to change the future of computing ... Next is
incredibly great,'' said Jobs.
   The Next will compete with such hot-selling technical
workstations as those from Sun Microsytems Inc., Apollo Computer
Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Some of those companies are working on
similar products that eventually will be sold for about $15,000.
   Apollo's manager of educational business, Pierre Bouchard, said
in a prepared statement Wednesday that ``Jobs has a lot of catching
up to do'' in the university market. ``Big software companies may
not be willing to take the time and money to (adapt) to his system,
an untested concept,'' Bouchard said.
   At a news conference after the demonstration, Jobs said software
by Adobe Systems Inc. and other companies gives the Next
exceptionally vivid graphics, offering photo-like realism and
numerous type fonts and sizes.
   The Next is built around three chips from Motorola Inc.,
including the 68030 microprocessor, a math chip and a signal
processing chip. It also has connections to industry-standard
network called Ethernet that will allow Next to share files with
other types of computers; Mathematica software, of special use for
sophisticated math equations; and built-in reference sources,
including a dictionary and the complete works of Shakespeare.

   Real estate mogul Donald Trump ended a week of
speculation Wednesday by announcing he has agreed to buy Eastern
Airlines' profitable Northeast air shuttle for $365 million in cash
and will rename it after himself.
   ``I want to run it as a diamond, an absolute diamond,'' Trump
proclaimed to reporters at a joint news conference with Texas Air
Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo at the Plaza Hotel in New York,
another recent Trump acquisition.
   He said the three-city service would be renamed ``The Trump
Shuttle'' and its blue-silver Boeing 727s would be redecorated and
emblazoned with red, black and gold stripes.
   The deal is expected to be completed by mid-December, if it
survives government scrutiny and a legal attack by Eastern's unions.
   Eastern's militant union leaders said the sale would be the
death of the airline and vowed a fight to overturn the deal.
   The announcement of the sale followed a week of speculation
about the billionaire developer's interest in buying the shuttle
from ailing Eastern, which is a major subsidiary of Texas Air.
   The $365 million price tag was well above previous estimates of
what Trump would pay.
   ``It's top dollar,'' said Robert Joedicke, an airline analyst
for the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Many analysts and other observers had estimated that the shuttle
_ which serves New York, Boston and Washington and is the most
profitable of Eastern's operations _ could fetch from $200 million
to $300 million. Texas Air had tried earlier this year to transfer
the shuttle operation from Eastern to a new subsidiary for $225
million, but Eastern unions blocked that attempt.
   Standard & Poor's Corp., in announcing that it was keeping a
close eye on Eastern in the wake of the shuttle sale, said the $365
million was ``a generous price.'' The interest on that sum could
recover more than half the cash flow that would be lost by selling
the shuttle, the credit-rating agency said.
   For the flamboyant and image-conscious Trump, the purchase of
the shuttle could be viewed more as a way to enhance his prestige
and influence than a straight business deal.
   Earlier this year, Trump bought the legendary Plaza for $400
million following a heated battle with other suitors. Trump has
admitted that he was ``in love'' with the hotel for more than a
decade and ``tore himself up'' to get it.
   But there also could be compelling business logic behind Trump's
latest acquisition. Many analysts said Trump might use the shuttle
to help draw people to his hotel and casino properties in Atlantic
City, N.J., on the weekends.
   ``It's something that we're looking at,'' Trump said at the news
conference.
   Trump now operates a helicopter service from New York to
Atlantic City. The resort city's Bader Field is too small to handle
the Boeing 727s operated by the shuttle, but the Atlantic City
Airport 10 miles from the city can accommodate them.
   Trump noted a report that he intended to sell the land earmarked
for a huge commercial development in Manhattan to help finance the
shuttle deal, but he did not directly address its accuracy. No
interested party could afford to pay him what the 100-acre site is
worth, he joked to reporters.
   Trump and Lorenzo said the shuttle would maintain fares
competitive with the competing shuttle service of Pan Am Corp. and
would not lay off any employees. The $365 million price tag
includes landing rights at airports in the three shuttle cities
plus 17 planes.
   Pan Am said it welcomed Trump into the shuttle market. Pan Am
claims its share of that market has jumped from around 24 percent
in October 1986 to roughly 45 percent.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said late Wednesday that the
airline's shuttle service had net income of around $16.8 million in
1987 on revenue of $40.3 million, down from a 1985 profit of $28.2
million on revenue of $49.2 million. Pan Am has not disclosed
earnings from its shuttle operations.
   The shuttle deal marks another tumultuous chapter in the saga of
Eastern, the Miami-based carrier that has been scarred by
management-labor feuding and $1 billion in losses over the past
decade.
   ``I think (the sale) was inevitable; you could see it coming,''
said Frank Borman, the former astronaut and chairman of Eastern.
   ``The inevitable problem at Eastern has been a very recalcitrant
union leadership,'' Borman said in a telephone interview from Las
Cruces, N.M., where he works as an aviation consultant.
   He said $365 million was a fair price for the shuttle.

<HEAD>CBS Posts Earnings Rise, Boosts Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Wednesday its third-quarter profit
climbed 16 percent, reflecting improved broadcasting results and a
hefty amount of interest earned on the money it has amassed from
asset sales.
   The company also said its board had boosted the quarterly
dividend by 47 percent, a move that some shareholders have been
pressing for in the wake of the recent sales of major assets such
as the magazine and records divisions.
   CBS said the dividend boost to $1.10 a share ``reconfirms our
confidence in CBS's future prospects and represents a tangible
sharing with our shareholders of our financial well-being.''
   But on the New York Stock Exchange, CBS fell 75 cents a share
Wednesday to $178.12{.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, CBS said it earned $69.9
million, or $2.72 a share, compared with $60.1 million, or $2.31 a
share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 4 percent to $568.8 million from
$545.5 million a year earlier.
   The CBS Broadcasting Group posted an operating profit of $49
million, up 7 percent from $45.6 million a year earlier.
   Laurence A. Tisch, president and chief executive, sales and
profits were up at the CBS Television Network despite the
presidential election coverage and disruptions to the fall season
caused by the now-resolved writer's strike.
   Results for the company's television stations were mixed with
soft local advertising demand in some markets, the company said,
while the radio division had higher sales and profits.
   But a big contributor to the improved overall results was the
$44.5 million in net corporate interest income recorded for the
quarter. The company had a net interest expense of $2.3 million in
the quarter last year.
   For the first nine months of the year, CBS had a profit of $1.11
billion, or $43.16 a share, up more than fivefold from earnings of
$200.9 million, or $7.84 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue edged up 1 percent to $2.01 billion from
$1.99 billion a year earlier.
   The nine-month results include an $866.6 million gain on the
sale of the CBS Records division to Sony Corp.
   The new dividend, up from 75 cents a share last quarter, is
payable Dec. 12 to shareholders of record Nov. 23.

<HEAD>Striking UAW Local Rejects Chrysler Contract For Second Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FENTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking United Auto Workers at a Chrysler
Corp. assembly plant on Wednesday narrowly rejected a new contract,
a week after walking off their jobs, a union official said.
   George Burr, president of UAW Local 110, said the three-year
agreement was rejected by 41 votes, with 1,197 members voting
against it and 1,156 voting for it.
   The suburban St. Louis plant is the only one producing the
long-wheelbase minivan, said Chrysler spokesman Lloyd Northard.
   It was the second vote on the contract, which was worked out
last Friday, two days after some 3,200 union members walked off
their jobs when negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline.
   In a vote Sunday, the contract was rejected by 61 percent of the
union's rank-and-file amid reports of illegal balloting.
   Burr said he thought the contract was rejected Wednesday because
of union members' concerns about outside contracting and
``outsourcing,'' the practice of shipping out work from the plant
to lower-paid workers.
   Those issues were taken away from Local 110 bargainers by the
international UAW, Burr said.
   The vote ``sends a message that the primary concern of the
people on the line and in the plant lies in the outsourcing and
outside contracting arena,'' Burr said. ``We recognize that this is
a problem.''
   Burr said the local leadership would be meeting Thursday and
would be in contact with the union's national leadership.
   Anthony P. St. John, vice president for human resources at
Chrysler Motors, said the company was ``deeply disappointed'' by
the vote because the local union bargaining committee, as well as
UAW Region 5 and the international union, had approved the
agreement last Friday.
   ``The result is that the St. Louis plant employees continue to
lose wages, several hundred employees elsewhere at Chrysler will
remain on layoff, and the corporate-wide profit sharing program for
all employees is affected adversely, as is Chrysler's loss of
revenue resulting from the strike,'' St. John said.
   ``We are considering the options available to us in this no-win
situation,'' he said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A battle for control of Zenith Electronics Corp.
officially began Wednesday when the company's largest shareholder
began soliciting shareholder consents for its plan to sell the
troubled company.
   Brookhurst Partners, a limited partnership formed by New York
investors Herbert B. Abelow and Nicholas L. Ihasz, mailed blank
consent forms to all Zenith shareholders along with a letter
outlining its proposals and urging shareholders to sign and return
the forms.
   If a majority of shareholders return signed forms by Dec. 4, the
Brookhurst proposals will take effect, just as if shareholders had
voted by proxy, Brookhurst said in a statement.
   Brookhurst wants to shrink Zenith's board of directors from 10
to six members and replace three of the remaining six with its own
nominees, who would be committed to a sale of the entire company.
   The dissident shareholders said shareholder value ``can be
maximized only through the sale of Zenith, and the election of our
nominees to the board of directors will best ensure that the sale
of the company is both actively pursued and fairly considered.''
   Brookhurst also is seeking a change in Zenith's bylaws to permit
shareholders owning at least 10 percent of the company's stock to
call a special meeting of shareholders. Brookhurst Partners owns
6.1 percent of Zenith, which is based in Glenview, north of Chicago.
   Officials of Zenith, the last U.S. television manufacturer, have
contended in a lawsuit that Brookhurst actually was seeking only to
drive up the price of Zenith's stock so it could sell its shares at
a profit. The company has asked the U.S. District Court in Chicago
to block the group's move.

<HEAD>First City Reports $23.6 Million Earnings for Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc., in its
first quarterly report since a $1.6 billion restructuring earlier
this year, on Wednesday announced a $23.6 million third-quarter
profit.
   Earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30 were in line with
the company's forecast of $98 million in net income for the first
12 months of operation, said A. Robert Abboud, First City's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   The forecast assumes gradually increasing earnings through the
period, Abboud said.
   The third-quarter earnings amount to 97 cents per share,
compared with net income of $17.2 million, or 70 cents per share,
for a shortened reporting period running from April 20 through June
30.
   First City was bailed out in April with $970 million in
assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., a spinoff of
$1.79 billion _ and possibly more _ in poorly performing assets and
a $500 million capital infusion from an investor group headed by
Abboud.
