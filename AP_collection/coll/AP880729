   Fire broke out at a downtown retirement hotel
Friday, forcing the evacuation of about 150 residents as flames
shot out of the top floor and roof of the six-story building,
authorities said.
   Nine of the elderly occupants of the Maryland Hotel were taken
to hospitals for treatment of minor symptoms ranging from smoke
inhalation to chest pains, said fire Capt. Richard McDowell.
   Hotel resident Wayne Huffman, 60, said he was standing in the
lobby shortly before 5 p.m. when he heard a hotel employee shout a
warning.
   ``The desk clerk came running up, yelling `The building's on
fire! The building's on fire!'''
   ``It was such a small fire,'' said Huffman. ``No one took it
seriously until we saw the smoke. Now here we are, out on the
street.''
   The blaze broke out during the commuter rush hour, drawing a
large crowd of spectators and snarling traffic. Hotel residents
were among the onlookers, some sitting in wooden chairs across the
street from the burning building.
   More than 75 firefighters were called to the scene and several
city blocks were cordoned off. They remained closed at 7 p.m. as
firefighters mopped up the blaze, which was confined to the sixth
floor.
   ``We don't have anything on cause or point of origin yet,''
McDowell said. He estimated 150 people were evacuated, including
two people who were rescued from the top floor by an
aerial-platform atop a firetruck ladder.
   ``Structurally, the building is sound,'' McDowell said. ``A wing
of the sixth floor was gutted,'' McDowell said, but firefighters
hoped residents of unaffected floors might return home later Friday
night, he said.
   Salvation Army officials were arranging hotel rooms for those
who needed them.

   Special emergency crews managed to put out a
fire Friday in an oil rig on the Gulf of Mexico that had been
blazing out of control, the state petroleum monopoly Pemex said in
a statement.
   ``The fire was put out by special crews at midday today at the
Puerto Ceiba 113 well and work continues to bring the well under
complete control,'' the statement said without giving details.
   No injuries have been reported since a fire to burn off natural
gas went out of control about dawn Thursday at the Puerto Ceiba 113
well, Pemex spokesman Emilio Matar said.
   The well is about 300 yards off the Tabasco state coast and
three miles from El Paraiso, a town of 26,000 people. El Paraiso is
400 miles southeast of Mexico City.
   Drilling had reached 19,000 feet when the well went out of
control.
   In addition to cooling the oil rig with water, emergency crews
placed a series of dams around the well to contain any oil spills,
the spokesman said.
   Mexico is the world's sixth largest producer of crude oil and
exports about 1.3 million barrels a day, about half of it to the
United States.

   Actress Cher and her 24-year-old
boyfriend, Robert Camilletti, were sued Friday by a free-lance
photographer who alleges Camilletti tried to run him down with
Cher's sports car.
   The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges
Cher was negligent by entrusting her Ferrari to Camilletti, and
accuses him of assault and battery on photographer Peter Brandt.
   In addition, Brandt is suing for emotional distress from the
accident Wednesday in front of Cher's Benedict Canyon home. The
sports car driven by Camilletti hit Brandt's Honda Accord, damaging
both vehicles.
   ``He chased him and said he was going to kill him,'' said
Brandt's attorney, Ron Carpol.
   Cher and Camilletti have blamed the accident on the tabloid
press and the frustration of dealing with paparazzi who incessantly
stake out their home.
   Camilletti was arrested Wednesday and booked for investigation
of felony assault with a deadly weapon. He has denied allegations
that he was trying to run down Brandt.
   Camilletti said in a statement prepared by his lawyer that he
had hoped to avoid the photographer's stakeout by swerving the car
into the Cher's driveway.
   The Oscar-winning actress, 42, and Camilletti have been
companions since meeting at a New York nightclub on her 40th
birthday. Marriage plans have been denied repeatedly by Cher's
publicist Lois Smith.
   A former bagel maker, pizza chef and bartender, Camilletti is
now pursuing an acting career and he recently completed shooting of
``Loverboy'' with Kate Jackson and Kirstie Alley.

   Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of songwriter
Irving Berlin, died Friday after the last of a series of strokes.
She was 85.
   Mrs. Berlin died at Doctors Hospital, where she was taken from
her Manhattan home.
   The last of Mrs. Berlin's four novels, ``The Best of Families,''
was published in 1970. She was also a prolific short-story writer.
   In one article for The New Yorker, she defended her generation's
abandonment of the Junior League and ``polite society'' for the
wilder life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.
   ``It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely
depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ``They go to find
privacy.''
   Her marriage to Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926, drew headlines as the
famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, wed the former Ellin Mackay, a
Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's
fortune for love.
   When her father reportedly threatened to disinherit his
daughter, Berlin reportedly replied, ``In that case, I'll probably
have to make her a wedding gift of a couple of million dollars.''
   ``It could be the greatest love affair of the century,'' said
composer and cabaret performer John Wallowitch, a neighbor. ``It
really is a tragedy.''
   Wallowitch, who leads a group in serenading Berlin on his
birthday, recalled that Mrs. Berlin could frequently be seen
walking in the neighborhood and went to Mass each Sunday at St.
Patrick's Cathedral until about 10 years ago.
   During 62 years of marriage, Berlin wrote several songs just for
his wife, including ``Always'' and ``The Song Is Ended.''
   Mrs. Berlin was born on her father's $6 million estate in
Roslyn. She and Berlin had three daughters. Mrs. Berlin was a major
supporter of the Girl Scout movement.
   She is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett of New
York; Linda Louise Emmett of Paris and Elizabeth Irving Peters of
New York; a brother, John W. Mackay of Locust Valley, nine
grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
   A funeral was scheduled for Tuesday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

   Share prices surged Saturday on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange for the fifth straight day of gains and a closing level
that topped 28,000 points for the first time since mid-July.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 115.54-point
winner Friday, advanced 288.31 points, or 1.02 percent, to close
Saturday's half-day session at 28,199.94.
   The Nikkei index, the most widely followed market barometer,
briefly hovered above 28,000 points in early trading Friday. But
Saturday's closing represented the first time the index has
finished above the 28,000 level since July 15.
   Volume on the first section was a heavy 700 million shares.
   Shinji Shihara of Okasan Securities said the Tokyo market was
taking a cue from sharp advances on Wall Street overnight.
   ``It's the fifth straight day of gains, but the market is really
moving up in reaction to New York trading.''
   The upsurge in shares prices has also been attributed to a
strong U.S. currency and reduced concern over growing inflation.
   ``It's not just the bullish London and New York market, but
we've got positive economic factors here (in Japan) along with a
strong dollar and less concern about inflation,'' said an analyst
with Nikko Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Shihara said light electricals like Sony were being sought along
with heavy electricals, financials and automakers on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The Tokyo foreign exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

<HEAD>Paris Swings To Them Ole' Bedouin Blues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paris is swinging to those old Bedouin blues. Songs
that once were chanted by Algerian shepherds to their sheep are now
drawing flocks of hip Parisians to dance in city clubs.
   The music is called ``rai.'' Pronounced ``rye,'' like the bread,
it is the latest sound rocking on French radio, a hard-driving
electrified wail that makes it hard to stay still.
   By fall, the pulsing Arab pop likely will be rolling from radios
across Europe and the United States as record companies, already
cashing in on the worldwide popularity of ethno-new wave, begin
promoting the music of northwestern Algeria.
   Bedouin sheep herders were the first to sing rai, punctuating
langorous melodies and improvised lyrics on Algerian angst with the
refrain ``ya rai, ya rai'' _ the nomad equivalent of ``oh yeah.''
   During World War II, the music shifted from fields around the
western town of Oran to bars and brothels in Algiers, where rai
singers borrowed American jazz riffs learned from black soldiers,
just as they had taken Flamenco passion and the paso doble from
Spanish settlers in Oran decades before.
   In 1981, an Algerian record producer realized it was cheaper to
synthesize drums than pay a drummer. Adding the drum machine was
the birth of rai pop, traditional minor-keyed melodies with a rock
n' roll beat. Big hits followed, like ``Ana Ma H'lali Ennoum''
(``Personally, I Don't Appreciate Sleeping Anymore'') and ``N'sel
Fik'' (``You Belong to Me'').
   Who cares if the Arabic slang belted out by the young rai stars
is incomprehensible to the average Parisian? The melodies are
haunting and the driving 4-4 beat swings.
   ``Rai is not poetry,'' Cheb Khaled, the charismatic Elvis of
Arab funk told the daily newspaper Liberation, which has two
reporters writing exclusively about Arab culture.
   ``Rai speaks directly to people about what is happening in their
lives. The things I sing about, I have lived,'' said Khaled.
   Khaled's new album, ``Kutche,'' was released June 7 in France.
It is the first top-quality, high-tech rai disk produced by a
Western record company, EMI-Pathe Marconi, based here.
   In August three other rai albums by a major British record
company are scheduled for release in the United States, England and
continental Europe, including one by Chaba Fadela, a female
vocalist with a rough, sensual voice who has sung duets with Khaled.
   The three disks will be marketed by Virgin Records. All have
attracted the attention of American disk jockeys, said Jumbo Van
Renen of Mango Records in London, a division of Virgin's Island
Records.
   Van Renen first heard rai in obscure Paris clubs four years ago.
He was fascinated by the freshness of the sound and saw its
commercial potential.
   ``There is a growing interest in global excellence and language
is no longer a barrier,'' Van Renen said in a telephone interview
from London. ``Rai is part of the new trend toward world music, it
is a sound that, in the tired world of rock 'n roll, is good and
new.''
   Rai is the latest trend in the globalization of pop. Paul
Simon's Grammy-winning ``Graceland'' owed much of its uniqueness to
the a capella South African male choir Ladysmith Black Mambazo,
which opened singer Joan Baez' sold-out Paris gig in June.
Musicians from Antigua to Zaire are finding new fans around the
world.
   A festival in 1986 that marked the debut of a several rai
singers in France attracted 5,000 people a day during the three
days of concerts. The music quickly began attracting audiences of
non-North Africans, the target market for Khaled's new release.
   ``Kutche'' takes its name from the Algerian version of the
Spanish word for car, ``coche,'' reflecting the multi-cultural
roots of the music.
   The record's instrumentation is a cultural melange as well.
Khaled's mellifluous, passionate voice pours over synthizers,
accordions, violins, traditional North African flutes, Algerian
bendirs (tamborines), Arabic derboukas (drums) and several African
percussion instruments.
   Martin Meissonier, who produced Khaled's album, launched
Nigerian bandleader King Sunny Ade and is credited with introducing
African music to the developed world.
   He called rai lyrics apolitical. But Algerian authorities banned
rai from the radio until three years ago, saying lewd lyrics on
wine, women and life in Algeria's fast lane had no place on Moslem
airwaves. They since have changed their minds and see the music as
a way to reach the young.
   ``Rai touches people because it is more than simply music,''
Meissonier said. ``Like reggae, it is an attitude. Rai is a way of
life.''

<HEAD>`Hoover-Ball,' Invented By Former President, Is Not for Wimps</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BRANCH, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential athletics often makes
people think of touch football in the Kennedy White House, but
Herbert Hoover invented a sport that makes those games look like
tea parties, say devotees of ``Hoover-ball.''
   ``Hoover-ball is not a sport for wimps,'' said Scott Sailor, who
is organizing the 1988 Hoover-Ball National Championship Aug. 7 in
West Branch, Hoover's birthplace.
   ``Hoover-ball'' is like volleyball played with a six-pound
medicine ball, except players must catch the ball and heave it back
over the eight-foot net. The hardest play may be serving, from 33
feet away, or receiving serve, where the ball comes crashing down
faster than the stock market in October 1929.
   ``One of the reasons for the tournament is that Hoover has had a
bad reputation in history. People think of the Depression when his
name is mentioned,'' said Sailor, part-time special events
coordinator for the Hoover Presidential Library and Museum here.
   ``We want to show there is more to Hoover, we want to show a
more personal side,'' he said.
   A medicine ball is constructed with a bag of sand at its core,
which is wrapped in cotton matting and covered by leather. Used
primarily by boxers, whose trainers bash them in the stomach with
it while they do situps, the ball is heavy and difficult to catch
when it comes flying down.
   When Hoover, the nation's 31st president, took office in 1929,
he carried a portly 210 pounds on a 5-foot-11-inch frame. His
physician, Admiral Joel T. Boone, was concerned and advised
excercise.
   The Republican president strung up a net on the south lawn of
the White House and ordered Cabinet members and other dignitaries
to divide into two teams.
   Except for Sundays, Hoover, Cabinet members and Supreme Court
justices played the game every day _ national holidays included _
from 7 a.m. to 7:30 a.m., regardless of weather.
   Teams of two to four players must catch the ball on the fly and
return it without passing. A point is won when the opposing team
fails to catch the ball or throws it out of bounds.
   ``It required less skill than tennis, was faster and more
vigorous, and therefore gave more exercise in a short time,''
Hoover wrote in his memoirs.
   ``Stopping a six-pound ball with steam back of it, returning it
with similar steam, is not pink-tea stuff.''
   Hoover lost 25 pounds playing the game. But, like his hopes for
a second term, the game faded away.
   Sailor and members of the Hoover Library are reviving it,
however, with the tournament held in observance of Hoover's birth
in 1874.
   Sailor said two teams from Kansas City, Mo., including a writer
from Sports Illustrated, will participate, as will about a dozen
other rag-tag squads.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union representing 12,000 Eastern Airlines
employees seeks to block the carrier from eliminating service in 14
cities in a lawsuit that contends the cutbacks will eventually
destroy the company.
   The suit requests a preliminary injunction or temporary
restraining order against the cutbacks in service, scheduled to
take effect Aug. 31. Eastern announced the changes, along with a
work force reduction of 4,000, last Friday.
   Unless the cutbacks are blocked, the suit says, Eastern will
``embark on a program that will significantly increase its
recurring losses and lead to the ultimate destruction of the
carrier.''
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers filed the suit Thursday in U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia. The union represents Eastern mechanics and
ground workers.
   Charles Bryan, president of the Machinists local in Miami, said
the union will argue that Eastern's reduction in service benefits
Continental Airlines. Both companies are subsidiaries of Texas Air
Corp. of Houston.
   ``This is an act of self-help,'' Bryan said at a news
conference. ``It's not too different from a lockout, quite
frankly.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the airline has ``taken
these actions because they're in the best interests of the company,
and we expect that the court will agree with us.''
   Eastern's cutbacks mean an 11.4 percent reduction in daily
flights. The financially struggling company said the move would
permit it to concentrate on serving cities where it is strongest.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts are using computer graphics to explore in
three dimensions the revolutionary artistic and scientific work of
Italian Renaissance genius Leonardo da Vinci.
   The results will be shown in the Hayward Gallery Jan. 26-April
16, said Rosalie Cass, an organizer of the exhibition.
   ``If Leonardo was around today there is no doubt he would be
using computers and what we are doing is to show that there was no
division in his mind between his science and his art,'' Miss Cass
said Thursday.
   She said the exhibition will combine the artistic and scientific
interests of da Vinci and display the greatest range of his
drawings ever assembled.
   ``Unlike photography, which records surface patterns of light
and color, computer graphics build realistic, three-dimensional
images,'' said Philip Steadman, who is directing the sequences.
   ``Leonardo's drawings are being plotted into a computer and the
sequences will make clear to visitors the spatial thinking and
development in his ideas on architectural projects, light in space
and geometrical bodies,'' he said.
   Participants will use the technique to analyze the perspective
of Leonardo's wall painting ``The Last Supper.''
   The painting of Jesus Christ, portrayed at the moment when he
tells his disciples that one of them will betray him, marks a
turning point in art. It presents questions on perspective that art
historians and scientists still have not completely solved since
the work was completed in 1497.
   ``Everything comes together in only one spot, but that varies
from different viewpoints and from some positions there appear to
be different vanishing points,'' Miss Cass said.
   The tempera painting, damaged by dampness, is on a refectory
wall in the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy.
   In his ``Treatise on Painting'' Leonardo wrote: ``Painting
encompasses the surfaces, colors, and forms of anything created by
nature, and philosophy penetrates those same bodies, considering
their properties, but is not satisfied with the truth as shown by
the painter.''
   Steadman said: ``It is striking how many of Leonardo's remarks
in his treatise, whether on human anatomy, optics or the structure
of plants, go well beyond the limits of what is strictly relevant
to the painter's needs, and how often a section ends with a remark
that he will pursue the subject elsewhere in one of his projected
scientific works.''
   The exhibition will have 119 drawings, 88 of them from the royal
collection at Windsor Castle, and Italian and British models built
recently from Leonardo's drawings of mechanical inventions.
   They include a construction of his flying machine with a 36-foot
wingspan, ball bearings, a tank and a multibarreled gun.
   Leonardo, who lived from 1452 to 1519, worked for Duke Lodovico
Sforza of Milan.
   He entered the duke's service after writing a celebrated letter
saying he believed he could give ``complete satisfaction'' in
military engineering, constructing buildings and sculpture in
marble, bronze or clay.
   ``In painting I can do as much as anyone, whoever he may be,''
he wrote.

   Chicago-area newlyweds who surfaced here after
dropping out of sight for nearly four months said Thursday they
understand why a lot of people are upset with them but are thankful
their relatives are forgiving.
   ``What can you say? We're prodigal children,'' said Scott
Swanson, 23, referring to the Biblical parable of a wayward
youngster who returns to his family in repentance and is welcomed
back.
   Swanson and his bride, Carolyn Swanson, 22, were reunited
Wednesday with her parents, Jim and Kathy MacLean of Haddonfield,
N.J. The elder MacLeans flew to San Diego after receiving a letter
from the couple Tuesday and talking to them by telephone later that
night.
   ``We didn't come out thinking we would be welcomed with open
arms (but) that's what happened with our families and that's the
most important thing,'' Swanson said. ``We came out really thinking
that we were going to be scorned for the rest of our lives.''
   The Swansons, students at Wheaton College in a suburb of
Chicago, disappeared April 2 without a word to relatives or friends.
   The vanishing act led to fears the couple met with foul play. It
provoked a massive and costly police investigation and search that
principally involved Chicago police but also included law
enforcements agencies from other states.
   The couple said Thursday they don't believe they should have to
make restitution for the police expenditures.
   ``It seems fairly unrealistic for them to try to prosecute us in
the sense that they want the money back,'' said Swanson.
   He said he believes it's the police rank-and-file, rather than
department officials, who want to see some kind of payment because
they feel ``really gypped.''
   ``It's like `Here are some yuppie kids from Wheaton College.
They just took off and we have no clues and we didn't know what to
do.' And they look silly, so they might want to retaliate,''
Swanson said.
   ``Nobody cares, it's over with,'' said an officer in the Chicago
Police Department's missing persons bureau who would not give his
name.
   The couple said they intend to remain in San Diego and pursue
their education. Swanson said he will pursue his goal of going into
the military reserve and wants to teach, while his wife said she
plans to write books.
   The Swansons, who eloped in late March, said their love for each
other grew while they toiled at jobs at separate delicatessens in
the upscale beachfront community of La Jolla, 10 miles north of
downtown San Diego.
   The two have been in San Diego since shortly after their
disappearance. Swanson said Wednesday night that they came here
because they ``didn't know anyone, and no one knew us. It has a
climate that is conducive to living outdoors if we needed to bum it
for a while.''

   A state college president resigned
Thursday after his use of trust funds for personal expenses came
under scrutiny and criticism.
   ``I can no longer offer the leadership which the college
requires and deserves, as a result of the intense publicity that
has come about in the wake of charges of inaccuracy in the
expenditures of general trust funds,'' Westfield State College
President Irving H. Buchen said in a letter.
   College trustees accepted the resignation unanimously after a
nearly three-hour private session, which Buchen did not attend.
   Trustees Chairman John St. Clair said there was no settlement
negotiated with Buchen, who had been paid $77,000 a year.
   ``Effective today, he is no longer a member of the faculty and
will receive no benefits except for any accrued vacation time,''
St. Clair said.
   ``It's sufficient to say that in a light most favorable to the
president, this could be viewed as careless attention to detail,
poor record keeping and mistakes in judgment relative to the use of
trust funds, which this board finds unacceptable,'' he said.
   St. Clair said the board would have no specific comment on the
results of its investigation into Buchen's expense accounts until
after submitting reports on the findings to the Hampden County
district attorney and a legislative subcommittee investigating the
use of state college trust funds.
   The Union-News of Springfield reported that Buchen billed
college trust funds for $3,400 in expenses by submitting allegedly
inaccurate or questionable vouchers for travel and dinners. He
later paid back $1,259.
   St. Clair said the trustees will appoint an interim chief
executive officer within a week. In the meantime, the board and the
four college vice presidents will run the 3,000-student
institution, he said.
   Buchen, 57, has been under fire for his use of college trust
funds for personal expenses and waiving entrance requirements for
his 16-year-old daughter. She attended the college and lived in a
dormitory during the fall semester last year, although she had not
graduated from high school. In January, Buchen apologized to
trustees and withdrew her from classes.
   Buchan had succeeded Francis J. Pilecki, who left amid charges
of sexual misconduct with male students and a furor over a $10,000
payment by trustees to one of the students.
   The 150-year-old college, founded by Horace Mann, was one of the
first coeducational public teachers colleges in the United States.

   As sand trickled through an hourglass on
Johnny Carson's desk, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton admitted to
``Tonight Show'' viewers that his comically savaged speech at the
Democratic convention did not go as planned.
   ``My sole goal was achieved, however. I wanted so badly to make
Dukakis look great, and I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams,''
said Clinton, to the laughter and applause of the show's studio
audience.
   Clinton delivered the nominating speech for Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis at last week's Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta. Allotted 15 minutes, Clinton spoke for 32 minutes,
ignoring flashing red lights and other attempts to cut him off.
Finally, Clinton's line ``I want to say, in closing'' drew applause.
   Carson told the audience in his monologue that Clinton was to be
a guest, and added: ``Not to worry we have plenty of black coffee
and extra cots in the lobby.''
   Carson introduced Clinton with a satirical, long-winded speech
of his own that included details ranging from the governor's
educational background.
   After Clinton sat on the couch, Carson said, ``My first question
is, how are you?'' then turned over the hourglass.
   The governor said that while his speech was ridiculed, his
constituents continued to support him. He said the speech was a
``good idea that didn't work.''
   Clinton tried a different approach to win over Carson's
audience, playing a tenor saxophone with the show's orchestra.
   Clinton's appearance on the Carson show was his latest attempt
to use humor to keep the disastrous speech from ruining his image
as a rising star in the Democratic Party. The governor, who
previously had a reputation as a good orator, began polishing his
quips in Little Rock shortly after the convention speech was over:
   ``It wasn't my finest hour,'' went one line. ``It wasn't even my
finest hour and one-half.''
   During a speech this week to about 150 educators, Clinton had
trouble with his microphone. Without skipping a beat, he said,
``Have the networks taken control of the mikes?''
   On Wednesday at the Capitol, Little Rock activist and
restaurateur Robert ``Say'' McIntosh dished up food for anyone
willing to dish out criticism for the Clinton bashers.
   Diners earned a free meal with lines such as:
   ``Bill Clinton may be a blabbermouth, but he's the best thing to
happen to Arkansas.''
   ``I appreciate my governor even if he is boring.''
   On Thursday, the Arkansas Democrat carried Clinton and Carson in
its editorial page comic strip ``Spanks.''
   The first frame shows Carson introducing Clinton with, ``Now
here's a man who was a miniseries unto himself _ ``Gone with the
windbag''_ Arkansas' TALK of the town _ Governor Clinton.''
   Clinton appears in the second frame in the image of comedian
Rodney Dangerfield saying, ``Hey, Johnny, I tell yuh, I don't get
no respect.''
   The last frame shows Clinton finishing his monologue, ``When I
was speaking at the convention, one delegate accidentally hit
another delegate with his sign.
   ``Oh excuse me!'' said the first delegate. ``I hit you with my
sign.''
   ``Hit me again,'' said the second delegate. ``I can still hear
him.''
   The Arkansas Gazette, on its op-ed page, carried a 13-paragraph
story by a retired newspaper editor who urged Clinton not to let TV
people get under his skin.
   ``If they were all as smart as they sometimes pretend to be,
surely some of them would be out there where the really big money
is _ selling red neckties to the people who are on television,''
wrote John E. Pruniski.
   Clinton, first elected governor in 1978 at the age of 32, met
Dukakis while serving as president of the National Governor's
Association last year and eventually landed a major role in
Dukakis' campaign as an adviser and sometime stand-in. Clinton, who
at one time flirted with the idea of running for president, was
among those talked of as a possible Dukakis running mate.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Jackson's Campaign To Free Hostages Doesn't Take
Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson has a winning record in helping
Americans in trouble abroad, but he failed to get the support of
the State Department and the Democratic and Republican presidential
candidates for a private bid to spring the nine U.S. hostages in
Lebanon.
   So Jackson is backing off, saying ``no meeting has been set and
no meeting has been sought'' for him to negotiate with Iranian
officials.
   The best chance for the hostages remains recognition by Tehran
that their confinement by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon is a
humanitarian issue and not a card to play in foreign policy
maneuvers.
   Jackson was quoted as saying on Wednesday that he was trying to
reach the Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, through
``third parties'' including Arab diplomats.
   ``I have continuously expressed my interest in doing whatever I
could to make a humanitarian appeal to gain release of the
Americans held hostage,'' he told The New York Times.
``Humanitarian appeals always help. They penetrate deeper than
political tradeoffs.''
   Jackson had made the freeing of the hostages a theme in his
unsuccessful pursuit of the Democratic presidential nomination.
Like a number of his proposals, it has a sweet and simple ring to
it.
   In January 1984, Jackson negotiated the release of Lt. Robert O.
Goodman Jr., a Navy airman who had been shot down by Syrian forces
in Lebanon. It was widely seen as an attempt by President Hafez
Assad, whose government is listed by the State Department as a
supporter of terrorism, to boost Jackson's political stock.
   In June 1984, possibly with similar intentions, Cuba worked out
arrangements with Jackson in Havana for the release of 48 American
and Cuban political prisoners.
   Despite this winning record, Jackson was publicly discouraged by
the State Department from trying his hand at personal diplomacy in
behalf of the hostages in Lebanon.
   ``Reverend Jackson's sentiments concerning the hostages are
those shared by all Americans,'' spokesman Charles E. Redman said
Thursday. ``But as for efforts to release the hostages, we believe
that official channels offer the best chance of success.''
   Redman said he meant working through the U.S. government.
   James B. Steinberg, deputy issues director in the presidential
campaign of Michael Dukakis, also voiced qualified disapproval.
``We do not know any of the facts about this matter. As a matter of
general policy, Gov. Dukakis has said that he does not favor
private citizens independently conducting foreign policy.''
   Kitty Dukakis, the Democratic candidate's wife, said her husband
would not sanction any attempt by Jackson to negotiate for the
hostages' release. ``My husband feels very strongly that
individuals can't negotiate, but governments negotiate with each
other,'' Mrs. Dukakis said. ``And he would discourage Jesse Jackson
from going to Iran and trying to do that.''
   Vice President George Bush, who will receive the Republican
nomination next month in New Orleans, was more critical of
Jackson's personal diplomacy. ``It shouldn't happen,'' he said.
``We're talking about very sensitive foreign policy. The
administration is empowered to conduct those negotiations at the
United Nations. We don't need any loose cannons rolling around the
deck.''
   The remark stung. Jackson criticized Bush on Thursday for
describing him as a ``loose cannon.'' But he also appeared to back
away from the idea of interceding with the Iranians.
   ``No meeting has been set, and no meeting has been sought,''
Jackson told The Associated Press. ``We've simply talked through
(United Nations) Secretary-General (Javier Perez) de Cuellar, who
did meet with the Iranian foreign minister.''
   Traditionally, private citizens are discouraged from conducting
U.S. foreign policy. There is even a law against it.
   In the case of Iran, the situation is particularly delicate.
   The Reagan administration was embarrassed when it tried to gain
freedom for the hostages by secretly selling missiles to Iran.
   The State Department, which did not support the fiasco, is
engaged in a careful campaign of messages and public statements
designed to draw Iran into a direct discussion of the Persian Gulf
war, the hostages and terrorism.
   So far, there has been no ``authorized'' response from Tehran.
   ``They know where to get hold of us,'' Redman said.
   An offer on Tuesday by Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, the
speaker of Iran's parliament, to help obtain the release of the
American captives if the United States returned frozen assets was
turned down.
   ``No deals,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman,
promptly retorted.
   If Iran agrees to talk with the United States the hostages will
be high on the agenda. But the Reagan administration does not want
to appear to be making another deal with Tehran.
   In the meantime, it is seeking release of the hostages through a
separate diplomatic track.
   When it comes to Iran and to the hostages, a badly burned Reagan
administration prefers proceeding with extreme caution.

   Six Israelis on the first diplomatic mission to
Moscow since the Kremlin broke diplomatic relations with the Jewish
state in 1967 say they want to review procedures for Soviet Jews
who want to leave.
   The Israeli diplomats planned to pray in Moscow's central
synagogue on the Jewish Sabbath, which begins this evening.
   Officially, the Israelis came Thursday to inspect the embassy
building on Bolshaya Ordynka Street. Israel has been paying the
Soviets $100,000 a year to rent the building and diplomats from the
Netherlands have been taking care of it.
   But the focus of the Israelis' visit is another role the Dutch
have been performing for the Israeli government _ the processing of
requests by Soviet Jews for Israeli visas.
   Meron Gordon, head of the delegation and a counselor at his
country's embassy in Rome, said his group might meet with prominent
Jewish refuseniks who have been denied permission by Soviet
authorities to leave the country.
   From January to June, 6,017 Soviet Jews emigrated, but only a
small fraction went to Israel. Last year, the Soviet Union allowed
8,011 Jews to emigrate.
   Four of the diplomats were born in the Soviet Union. Gordon left
in 1957 at the age of 10.
   ``I think you have an expression _ butterflies in the stomach,''
he said at Sheremetyevo airport after the group arrived from
Amsterdam. ``The ones I have in my stomach are very big.''
   Gordon said he hopes the visit is ``the first step in developing
the process of improving relations between the states of Israel and
the Soviet Union.''
   But Kremlin officials stress that the visit is not a precursor
to the restoration of diplomatic relations, broken off after Israel
seized lands from Egypt, Jordan and Syria during the 1967 Middle
East War.
   The Soviet visas the delegation received in the Netherlands
entitle them to a two-month stay in the Soviet Union.
   The Kremlin says it won't restore relations until Israel
withdraws from the occupied territories and agrees to an
international Middle East peace conference.
   Israel insisted the Kremlin allow its representatives to visit
in exchange for permission for a Soviet consular delegation to
visit the Jewish state. Eight Soviet diplomats have been in Israel
since last July to survey Russian Orthodox Church property and meet
with Soviet citizens living there.

<HEAD>Witness: North Wanted to Give Anti-Drug Money to Contras Instead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. drug enforcement official says former
White House staffer Oliver L. North suggested in 1984 that $1.5
million designated for a drug sting operation be diverted to the
Nicaraguan Contras instead.
   Ron Caffrey, now in charge of the Atlanta office of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, told a House panel Thursday the DEA
rejected the idea. Caffrey said he told North the suggestion would
have compromised the chief operative in one of the agency's most
significant undercover operations.
   As it turned out, according to Caffrey and other DEA witnesses,
the investigation was compromised anyway _ and closed prematurely _
several weeks later when details were leaked to the Washington
Times.
   The hearing was the first in a series by the Judiciary
subcommittee on crime, which is trying to learn whether Reagan
administration officials condoned drug smuggling and other criminal
activities to further its Central American policy _ especially
winning aid for the Contra rebels.
   Chairman William J. Hughes, D-N.J., said the panel has
``discovered many, many instances of persons in or associated with
... elements of our government attempting to convert, to divert,
and to subvert the criminal justice process.''
   North, who has been indicted in the separate diversionof
millions of dollars from the administration's Iran arms sales to
the Contras, figured prominently in Thursday's testimony.
   The testimony focused on a 1984 sting operation, in which DEA
used convicted drug pilot Barry Seal to make contact with the
Colombian cocaine cartel _ then operating in Nicaragua _ and a
purported Nicaraguan government official, Federico Vaughn.
   Hughes later said the committee has doubts about whether Vaughn
was in fact part of the government.
   Nonetheless, four DEA witnesses said North was interested in
exposing an alleged involvement of the marxist Nicaraguan
government in drug smuggling, so the Reagan administration could
win an upcoming congressional vote on Contra aid.
   Caffrey, who was in charge of the DEA cocaine desk in 1984, said
he briefed North on the undercover operation in late June or early
July 1984, after Barry Seal had brought cocaine back from Nicaragua
to the United States.
   Seal at the time was functioning as a DEA operative, hoping his
cooperation would bring him a lenient sentence.
   Caffrey said he told North that the DEA planned to send Seal
back to Nicaragua to make a $1.5 million payment for the drugs he
brought back, with the money to be split between the Colombia drug
kingpins in Nicaragua and Nicaraguan officials.
   ``Col. North asked why we couldn't land the plane outside
Managua and turn the money over to the Contras,'' Caffrey said.
   The DEA official said he responded that such a plan would
jeopardize Seal, who had won the trust of the Colombian drug cartel
and of Vaughn, identified by the DEA witnesses as an official of
the Nicaraguan interior ministry.
   Most of the hearing centered on the news leak to the Washington
Times, which published its story on the Seal operation July 17,
1984. Seal then became a government witness rather than an
operative, but was machine-gunned to death in early 1986 after
declining federal protection.
   Caffrey said when he briefed North on the operation before the
story was leaked, the then-National Security Council staffer
``asked when the operation could go public.''
   He added that North ``did indicate to me there was a vote coming
up on an appropriation bill to aid the Contras. I told him public
disclosure would come from the U.S. attorney or the attorney
general ... but we had a lot of goals left in the investigation''
and did not want to compromise it.
   Ernst Jacobsen, the DEA undercover agent who directed Seal, said
that following the leak, ``I heard from my superiors the leak came
from an aide in the White House.'' Still an undercover agent,
Jacobsen testified from behind a screen.
   A former top DEA official, ex-assistant administrator Frank
Monastero, testified, ``I thought the leak came from the White
House because of the Contra vote that was coming up.''
   Monastero told the subcommittee that the day the news story
appeared, an irate North called him to deny that he was responsible
for the leak. North, he said, accused the DEA of telling a reporter
that North was the source of the information.
   ``He called to say he did not leak the information and the proof
was the facts (in the story) were not accurate,'' Monastero said.
``My response was, `That's the standard way to cover your tracks.'
I didn't accept that.''
   Pages from North's diary, released by the subcommittee, show the
former White House staffer made frequent references to the drug
operation in the weeks before the leak.
   And the diary shows he was aware of photographs from the
investigation showing cocaine being loaded at a Nicaraguan airstrip.
   Jacobsen said that shortly before the leak, a CIA agent in Miami
told him the spy agency planned to leak the material to the news
media to suggest Sandinista involvement in drug smuggling.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Air Controllers' Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has upheld a Reagan
administration program of drug testing for air traffic controllers,
saying they ``have the lives of thousands of people in their
hands.''
   U.S. District Judge John Vukasin's ruling was the first in favor
of a drug testing program by a judge in the federal court here,
where labor groups have filed most of their suits attacking the
administration's plans for urine testing of federal employees.
   An appeal of the ruling is expected.
   Another federal judge in San Francisco has struck down a testing
program for all federal prison workers, and the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which covers California and eight other Western
states, has ruled against mandatory testing of railroad crews after
accidents and rule violations. The latter decision has been
accepted for review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Vukasin announced his ruling July 19 but has not yet issued it
in written form. A transcript of his comments was made available to
reporters Thursday.
   The lawsuit, like those against other drug programs, contended
random drug testing is unconstitutional because it is not based on
individual suspicion of impairment from current drug use. The suit
also argued that drug testing was unreliable and would be
ineffective in promoting safety.
   The judge said he was unimpressed by statistics showing that
less than 1 percent of air traffic controllers had shown signs of
drug use in testing so far.
   ``We are talking here about air traffic controllers who have the
lives of thousands of people in their hands,'' Vukasin said.
   In response to arguments that drug testing doesn't show whether
an employee is currently impaired or under the influence, Vukasin
said, ``Unfortunately, the state of the art has not reached that
level. But that is not an argument of why what at least is
available to the (Federal Aviation Administration) should not be
exercised and utilized.''
   Apparently referring to the ruling on railroad workers, he said
he ``may be failing to follow precedents, but if so, it is not done
out of disrespect.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No major adjustments because of this year's
drought are in the works for the Agriculture Department's 1989
wheat acreage program.
   Winter wheat producers soon will be planting next year's crop,
and the no-change announcement Thursday by Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng helps clear the way. All they need now is rain.
   As it stands now, wheat farmers will have to idle 10 percent of
their base acreage in 1989 to qualify for federal price supports,
the same as announced last spring.
   The 10 percent acreage reduction for next year was announced on
May 25, under 1985 farm law which requires a determination for the
following year's crop prior to June 1. That was before the drought
became so widespread and severe.
   ``Even though the severe drought has reduced wheat production,
especially that of spring wheat, the prospective supply-demand
balance (for the coming year) does not call for a change in the
previously announced wheat acreage reduction program in 1989,''
Lyng, who was out of town, said in a statement.
   A crop projection issued on July 12 put the 1988 wheat crop at
1.84 billion bushels, down from 2.12 billion bushels forecast in
June. The 1987 harvest was about 2.1 billion bushels.
   But U.S. wheat inventories have been large, despite a heavy
export drain, and totaled around 1.27 billion bushels on June 1,
the beginning of the 1988-89 wheat marketing year. The smaller
harvest will result in a further reduction in the stockpile to
around 666 million bushels by June 1, 1989, according to the
projections.
   Earlier, the June 1, 1989, wheat carryover was forecast at 781
million bushels.
   Winter wheat, which comprises about three-fourths of the U.S.
total, will be planted this fall for harvest next year. Spring
wheat, including durum used for pasta, is produced farther north
and bore the brunt of this summer's drought damage to the wheat
crop.
   In a related development, officials served notice that wheat
export subsidies are continuing, despite the drought and reduction
in wheat supplies.
   Melvin E. Sims, general manager for the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service, said China has bought an additional 400,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   The sales, equal to about 14.7 million bushels, were handled by
two companies: Cargill Inc., 200,000 tons, and Ferruzzi USA Inc.,
200,000 tons.
   Sims said the sales were part of an authorized 2 million tons of
wheat announced April 5 under the Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP, and some left over from an earlier authorization.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent wheat prices at farm points have averaged around $3.46 per
bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $50 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Prior to the new authorization on April 5, China had bought 4.9
million tons of wheat under EEP subsidy arrangements. Sims said
China has 610,000 tons still available for use.
   Under the program, exporters can sell U.S. commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonuses due the four companies averaged $9.84 per
ton of wheat, or about 27 cents a bushel. The bonuses will be paid
in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.

   Drought may be gnawing at the bank accounts of
many farmers, but the hot, dry weather isn't expected to cut back
on their spending for many production items this year, according to
an Agriculture Department report.
   ``The drought is expected to have little impact on 1988
expenditures for seed, fertilizer and pesticides because most of
these ... were applied at or before planting,'' the report by the
department's Economic Research Service said Thursday. ``Farm
machinery expenditures are projected to increase again in 1988 but
could be slowed by the drought.''
   Spending on the fuel and electricity needed to run farms will be
affected significantly by the drought, however.
   ``Energy expenditures for irrigation will be up, but likely will
be more than offset by decreased outlays for harvesting and
drying,'' the report said, a grim reminder that reduced yields _ or
none at all _ mean it will cost less to run grain combines and
dryers.
   Spending on farm machinery increased $1.2 billion to $5.8
billion in 1987, ending seven years of decline, the report said.
   Net cash income of farmers _ the difference between gross cash
receipts and cash expenses _ rose to a record $56 billion in
calendar 1987. Current USDA forecasts put 1988 net cash income at
$53 billion to $59 billion.

   The U.S. Labor Department is putting the
finishing touches on an emergency aid package for thousands of
migrant workers stranded in the drought-parched Midwest, a
department spokesman said.
   Labor Department spokesman Bob Zachariasiewicz said Thursday the
agency ``has a plan of action'' but it won't be unveiled until
Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, who is overseas, gives it her final
approval. An announcement is likely next week.
   A source said the package would total $4 million to $5 million
but ``the final distribution is just not set on paper yet.''
   The package follows appeals by Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas,
for assistance to migrant and seasonal workers who were unable to
earn a living this summer because of the drought.
   In his letter to Mrs. McLaughlin, Bustamante said: ``Migrant
workers pinned their hopes on a successful harvest and invested
their personal savings to search for field work. Drought conditions
have dashed their hopes for employment and for recouping their
financial losses.
   ``Because the president's emergency relief program is directed
solely at the farmer level, migrant workers and their families have
no safety net to relieve their conditions. Measures taken to date
have allowed migrant laborers to fall through cracks.''
   Bustamante, a migrant worker for 23 years and the son and
grandson of Mexican-Americans who followed the crops, said he still
has relatives who travel from Texas to Minnesota to harvest sugar
beets.
   Bustamante estimates the stranded migrant and seasonal worker
population at about 10,000, but said it is difficult to get a true
figure because ``they don't have a high profile. ... They're not a
voting bloc like some others that make a lot of noise.''
   ``Exhausted of their personal financial resources, they have no
money for temporary shelter and food,'' he wrote. ``Many would like
to return home, but they cannot. They are broke, indebted, stranded
and dependent on the kindness and charity of local efforts.''
   He said he is seeking funds to provide shelter, food and
job-search assistance to migrants who want to stay in the Midwest
to help farmers salvage crops, and to give others who want to
return home money for travel.
   Bustamante also sent his appeal to President Reagan, Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng and Texas Gov. Bill Clements.

<HEAD>Senators Prepare Legislation On Greenhouse Effect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators are using the closing weeks of the
100th Congress to put the issue of global warming from the
``greenhouse effect'' at the top of their environmental agenda for
next year.
   They got the ball rolling this week with the introduction of
legislation prompted by a series of hearings over the last two
years at which scientists warned that the greenhouse effect
threatens the planet with higher temperatures, climate changes and
rising oceans in the next century.
   Sixteen senators, including Energy Committee Chairman Bennett
Johnston, D-La., unveiled a comprehensive plan on Thursday that
calls for a variety of steps, from developing safer nuclear power
to slowing the destruction of forests in the Third World.
   A day earlier, a group headed by Robert Stafford, R-Vt.,
submitted a package to end U.S. use of chlorofluorocarbons, the
chemicals that contribute to global warming and destroy the Earth's
vital ozone layer.
   Johnston, who has been identified more with energy development
and production than environmental protection, said he would hold a
series of hearings in coming weeks to set the stage for 1989.
   Next year, he said at a news conference, ``we'll have to begin
the serious process of legislating. We'll act as fast as the
public's willing to support us.''
   Johnston is a cosponsor of most elements in a package developed
by Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., that represents the broadest Capitol
Hill response yet to the greenhouse warnings.
   ``The greenhouse effect is the most significant economic,
political, environmental and human problem facing the 21st
Century,'' Wirth said.
   Johnston, who recently held a hearing on the greenhouse effect,
said: ``The evidence of global warming is virtually undeniable. It
is so much more comprehensive, dangerous and life-changing than
anything we've ever seen.''
   Aides said Johnston has become convinced that global action is
necessary to combat the production of carbon and other gases that
scientists say trap heat in the atmosphere.
   Johnston stopped short of endorsing a key element of Wirth's
proposal: reducing carbon monoxide emissions by requiring new car
fleets to average 55 miles per gallon by 2010, a doubling of the
1985 fuel efficiency standard.
   The Wirth package would force this country to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2000. Scientists estimate that
carbon dioxide, coming mostly from fossil fuel combustion, produces
about half the world's greenhouse gases. The United States is said
to be responsible for 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide
emissions.
   The proposal would require administration officials to draft a
national energy plan emphasizing the least expensive ways to reduce
fossil fuel use and increase use of renewables such as solar energy.
   The package would authorize about $1 billion through 1992 for
research and development of non-fossil energy sources and a new
generation of safer and cheaper nuclear reactors. It also calls for
greater reliance on cleaner-burning natural gas for heating and
transportation.
   On the international front, the secretary of state would be
urged to hold a meeting aimed at getting other nations to commit to
a 50 percent cut in greenhouse gas production by 2015.
   The legislation also would authorize this country to spend more
than $1.5 billion in the early 1990s to provide birth control
information in an effort to slow the demand for fossil fuels in
burgeoning nations.
   It also calls for the United States to work through
international lending and development agencies to slow the
destruction of forests, which consume carbon dioxide when alive but
which emit huge amounts when they are cut down.
   Johnston said that to slow down polluting development in the
Third World, ``we're going to have to pay for their non-development
in some way, and it's going to be expensive.''
   Joining as cosponsors were Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; John Chafee, R-R.I.; John Danforth,
R-Mo.; Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.; Albert Gore, D-Tenn.; John Heinz,
R-Pa.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; John Melcher, D-Mont.; Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Terry Sanford, D-N.C.; and
Robert Stafford, R-Vt.

   Advocates of a proposed memorial to honor
black Revolutionary War soldiers are concentrating on a design now
that two federal commissions have approved its location on the
National Mall.
   The Fine Arts Commission and the National Capital Planning
Commission on Thursday approved plans to build the memorial in
Constitution Gardens, a grasy area close to the reflecting pool
between the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument.
   The two panels also voted, at separate meetings, to approve a
plan to build a memorial honoring women in military service at the
entrance of the Arlington Cemetery.
   Advocates for both projects next must develop designs and win
another round of approvals from the two panels and the National
Capital Memorial Commission, which approved the siting plans last
month.
   Marshall E. Purnell, executive vice president of Devrouax &
Purnell, one of three architectural firms involved with the
project, said designers will meet with memorial supporters ``to get
a feel for what they think it should look like.''
   The designers will then draft plans to present to the memorial's
foundation by early next year. If approved, the design will be
presented to the three agencies for their approval. Purnell
estimated the project would be completed in about 2{ years.
   Private donations are expected to pay for the project, estimated
at $4 million.

<HEAD>Comet May Have Triggered Ancient Wave Which Smashed Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 66-million-year-old rock deposit in a Texas
creek bed shows that the area was once smashed by a massive ocean
wave, perhaps triggered by a large comet or asteroid that hit the
Atlantic Ocean, according to a study published today in the journal
Science.
   Thor A. Hansen, a geologist at Western Washington University,
said he and another researcher found evidence that a wave, perhaps
as tall as 300 feet, scoured the floor of a primitive Gulf of
Mexico, picked up sand and shark teeth, then dumped the material in
what now is in a bed of a tributary to the Brazos River in Central
Texas.
   ``It (the wave) was so big, we think the circumstantial evidence
is very strong that it was caused by a bolide (meteorite) impact,''
said Hansen.
   The deposit, he said, was found in what is called the
Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. This is the name given a geologic
formation that other researchers have identified as having been
created during a time that meteorites were showering Earth, about
66 million years ago.
   Hansen said the formation he found in the Texas creek bed is
rich in iridium, an element that is common in meteorites but rare
on Earth. It is considered a universal mark of the
Cretaceous-Tertiary (called K-T) boundary.
   At the time that the wave was created, Hansen said Texas and the
whole Gulf coast area looked far different than now. The waters of
the ocean were much higher and the coast was much farther inland.
   Hansen said the massive wave churned against the ocean floor,
moving huge clay boulders, picking up sand, limestone and shark
teeth, and leaving a path of great erosion.
   When the waters settled down, the debris was deposited again on
the ocean floor, leaving a mark of the violence that occurred. Over
many centuries, the sea water receded, dry land emerged and now the
deposit left by the wave is seen in the wall of a creek bed in
Falls County in Central Texas.
   ``The thing that is remarkable about this deposit is that it was
produced far offshore on a quiet water shelf,'' said Hansen.
``Above and below is just mud, quiet water sedimentation. There's
no evidence of any disturbance at all. Yet, in the middle of that,
there is this quite large unit.''
   Based on the force required to move the material left in the
deposit, Hansen said he calculated that the wave had to be 150 to
300 feet high.
   Circumstantial evidence, he said, leads to the theory that a
meteorite striking the ocean caused the wave because there is no
geologic evidence suggesting that a volcano or an earthquake could
have triggered the wave.
   ``There was no volcanic activity nearby at the time,'' he said.
``Also, we find no volcanic ash in the formation.''
   The only other thing that could have created such a large wave
of this type, said Hansen, is a meteorite about six miles in
diameter that probably struck the west central Atlantic Ocean.
   Other researchers, he said, have found K-T formations in
Arkansas, Haiti, Mexico and offshore from North Carolina. All of
these, said Hansen, help support the idea that a boulder from space
swamped Texas with a splash some 66 million years ago.
   Co-investigators with Hansen in the study were Joanne Bourgeois
and Patricia Wiberg of the University of Washington, Seattle, and
E. G. Kauffman of the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colo.

<HEAD>Researchers Find AIDS Disrupts Key Immune Response In Cell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have long known that the AIDS
virus can kill the disease-fighting T-cells in the body, but
research published today shows that the virus can also destroy the
immune system simply by disrupting the inner mechanism of these
cells.
   In a study published today in Science, a group of researchers
said they have found that the AIDS virus is able to block a
function of a key molecule in T-cells and prevent the immune
response from taking place.
   Robert J. Hartzman of the Naval Medical Research Institute in
Bethesda, Md., said he and his co-researchers made the finding by
comparing the response of T-cells that were infected with the AIDS
virus with T-cells that were uninfected.
   Normally, T-cells respond to an antigen by binding to it and
then starting a process that leads to the production of antibodies.
Part of this process is a signal by a molecule called the CD3
receptor which is on the outside of the T-cell. This signal crosses
the cell wall and triggers production of calcium within the cell.
This calcium then leads to the next step in producing an antibody
against the disease.
   Hartzman said the study showed that in T-cells infected with
HIV-1, which is an AIDS virus, the ability of the CD3 receptor to
release calcium is blocked or retarded.
   ``This is a mechanism that can disrupt the immune response,''
said Hartzman. ``We knew that HIV can kill T-cells. Now this shows
that it can also reduce the qualitative response of those cells.''
   The study was conducted using T-cells from healthy donors. Part
of the cells were infected with HIV and the rest were not. The
cells were cultured for 60 days and then exposed to a antibody that
would mimic the early response to an antigen.
   In the uninfected cells, the CD3 took the normal next step by
releasing calcium into the interior of the cell. The T-cells
infected with HIV, however, did not release the calcium, which
stopped the immune response.
   Marvin Reitz, a researcher in an AIDS laboratory at the National
Cancer Institute, said the research ``would answer part of the
question of how the immune response is messed up by the virus in a
way that doesn't kill the cell.''
   He said it is not clear, however, if the experiment involved
T-cells that were actively expressing the HIV virus. Such cells,
said Reitz, are usually killed within a short time anyway.
   Co-researchers with Hartzman in the study were Carl H. June of
the Naval Medical Research Institute, Gerald P. Linette of
Georgetown University, Washington, and Jeffrey A. Ledbetter of the
Oncogen Corp. in Seattle.

   An Irish girl who crossed the Atlantic as a
stowaway on a Navy destroyer told a judge Thursday she yearns for
her homeland, and her mother said the family might seek legal
action against the U.S. government.
   ``I just want to go home,'' 16-year-old Suzanne Twomey of Cork
told Wake County District Court Judge Fred Morelock. The judge put
her in custody of two Naval Investigative Service agents who were
escorting her.
   Miss Twomey was put on a flight to New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport, and left from there at 10:45 p.m. on a
flight to Shannon, Ireland.
   The girl apparently slipped aboard the USS Conyngham while it
was on a courtesy call in Cork Harbor. She was discovered aboard
the guided missile destroyer Saturday when it returned to its
Norfolk, Va., base.
   Three officers searched the ship after hearing a girl was aboard
and found her in a 2{-foot-wide, 15-foot-long, 3-foot-high
compartment above a refrigeration unit.
   Five sailors accused of helping the girl were being held at the
Norfolk Naval base, authorities said. If charged and convicted,
they face a maximum five years in prison and a fine of $2,000 for
aiding an illegal entry into the United States.
   Meanwhile, Miss Twomey's parents said they are considering suing
the U.S. government.
   ``There is a lot more to this than meets the eye,'' said
Christine Twomey. Mrs. Twomey said U.S. officials had telephoned
her in Ireland to apologize.
   They said her daughter could not have boarded the ship
undetected without help from crew members, Mrs. Twomey said.
   In court Thursday, Miss Twomey listened intently as Assistant
District Attorney J. Franklin Jackson told the judge she was a
runaway and would be considered an undisciplined child under the
American court system.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Rocco J. de Grasse said no charges would
be filed against Miss Twomey.
   After the hearing, deGrasse approached Miss Twomey and gave her
a stern lecture. He said her status as a juvenile had protected
her, but that she had committed a serious offense.
   A Delta Airlines flight carrying the girl to Atlanta for a
connecting flight home was diverted to Raleigh on Tuesday when she
became sick. She was released Wednesday night from Rex Hospital,
said Mary West, a nursing supervisor who did not know what the girl
was treated for.
   Bill Berry, a Delta spokesman in Atlanta, said the Navy had
asked Wednesday night about booking the girl on another Delta
flight to Ireland, but the airline refused her passage because of
possible medical problems.

<HEAD>U.S. Pressing Soviets for Afghan Mine Maps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. interagency team is meeting daily in
Washington to plan for what is expected to be one of the largest
refugee migrations in this century, the return of exiled Afghans to
their homeland.
   The refugees are expected to include some 3 million in Pakistan
and another 2.2 million exiled in Iran. There are also between 1
million and 3 million Afghans still inside their country but who
have been displaced by the anti-Soviet guerrilla war.
   As part of the repatriation planning, the United States is
pressing the Soviet Union for maps showing the locations of land
mines scattered by Soviet troops throughout Afghanistan, a top
State Department official said Thursday.
   At the same time, Pakistan's foreign minister, in a meeting with
Secretary of State George Shultz, allayed concerns that the Soviet
Union was reneging on its timetable for withdrawing troops from
Afghanistan. ``This impression has just been dispelled,'' Sahabzada
Yaqub Khan said.
   Shultz, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and Yaqub Khan are
comparing notes on how to monitor the Soviet withdrawal _ and on
Afghanistan's future after the troops are gone.
   One of the immediate problems is the land mines. A team of
Defense Department experts recently visited Pakistan to assess the
extent of the mine problem across the border in Afghanistan, said a
senior official involved in the refugee repatriation effort. The
official asked not to be identified.
   The official said the Pentagon team recommended that Afghan
refugees be taught how to recognize mines so they do not
inadvertently step on them, and that some of them be trained to
deactivate the explosive devices.
   ``They have to be trained in mine awareness. They'll have to
live with it for decades,'' he said.
   Some refugees returning to the town of Barikot stepped on mines
in recent weeks, and word of the danger spread among the refugee
camps in Pakistan.
   U.S. officials say it is difficult to determine just how many
mines are strewn around the rugged Afghan countryside because many
of the devices were dropped out of helicopters rather than
methodically sown. Estimates vary from 5 million to 30 million.
   ``We're telling them (the Soviets) that they're responsible for
the devastation, and the least they can do is help with maps,''
said the State Department official. The Soviets have said they
removed most of the mines and that the remaining ones were planted
by the U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting the Soviets.
   ``That's just false,'' the U.S. official said.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Threatens Suit Over Dangers of Play Sand</HEAD>

   A consumer group says it will sue the Consumer
Product Safety Commission if it doesn't do something about what the
group sees as the threat of cancer lurking in children's sand piles.
   A commission officials said Thursday there is no evidence that
commercial play sand causes cancer, but the commission will make a
formal decision on a petition to ban limestone products, including
play sand, in September.
   Industry officials say if sand from the nation's rock quarries
caused cancer, there would be higher instances of the disease among
workers in the centuries-old industry.
   Public Citizen, a non-profit organization which fights for
product safety and public health, said in a news release Thursday
that many of the nation's children could be exposed to play sand
that contains dangerous asbestos or asbestos-like tremolite fibers.
   ``During the hot summer of 1988 your children may be playing in
the sandbox. Would you want them to be breathing asbestos as they
pour buckets of sand over each other?'' the consumer group asked.
   Asbestos fibers have been proven to cause cancer when inhaled.
Children who are exposed to them may not be afflicted until many
years after exposure, the group said.
   In a letter to the product safety commission, Public Citizen
said that if the agency does not indicate within 30 days that it
plans to resolve the issue, the group will consider legal action.
   Appeals to the safety commission to protect workers and
consumers from exposure to rock-based fibers date back 12 years. In
May, the agency said it had evaluated several play sand samples and
did not find asbestos in any of them.
   Public Citizen, however, said sand sold under two brand names,
Basins Play Sand and Quickrete Kiddie's Fun Sand, have been shown
by tests to contain tremolite, a rock-forming mineral that can
occur in an asbestos form.
   ``No one knows how many other brands may be similarly
contaminated,'' the group said.
   An official of Package Pavement of Stormville, N.Y., a
distributor of Kiddie's Fun Sand, said five outside tests have been
conducted on its sand and none found harmful ingredients.
   ``All indications are that there is no such fiber in our play
sand,'' said Eileen Doherty, vice president for marketing. She said
sand from a quarry in Connecticut does contain tremolite, but in a
crystalline form which is not harmful.
   Sandra Eberle, safety commission program manager for chemical
hazards, said no one has found true asbestos in play sand. She said
the fiber-like particles that have raised concern are not tremolite
asbestos but ultra-thin cleavages from crystalline tremolite that
occur in some marble-based sand.
   ``It's very upsetting to us because parents get naturally
terrified. I've spent a lot of time on the phone telling people
this is not asbestos,'' she said.
   Ms. Eberle said, however, that the commission is still
considering a petition by New Jersey geologist and physician Mark
Germine to ban all limestone products, including play sand, lawn
and garden limestone and consumer gravel products.
   Rick Renninger of the National Stone Association, which
represents the industry, said the claim of cancer-causing
ingredients in sand is old and is not backed up by the evidence.
   ``We produce a billion tons of stone a year in the United
States, and we've been doing it for a couple of hundred years,'' he
said. ``I think that there'd be evidence of asbestos disease
problems in people exposed for their entire working lives, and
there simply isn't.''
   Renninger said tremolite is among the most common rock-forming
minerals and is found in almost every rock product.
   Public Citizen researcher Dr. Lynn Silver, a pediatrician,
accused sand distributors of trying to hide the danger of their
products.
   ``The industry throws up a smokescreen,'' she said in an
interview. ``If somebody dies from falling off the left side of a
skyscraper, they tell you there's nothing to prove that falling off
the right side is also dangerous.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Sounds Reaganesque In Nevada Appearance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is seasoning his
Western campaign with a Democratic version of the Sagebrush
Rebellion that helped sweep the Republicans into the White House
eight years ago.
   Ronald Reagan capitalized on the independent spirit of the West
by promising to get government off the backs of the people.
Bentsen, campaigning for the vice presidency as Michael Dukakis'
running mate, sounded a lot like Reagan in a speech in Reno, Nev.,
on Thursday.
   ``If there is one lesson we have learned in recent years, it is
that the federal government can't solve all of the (nation's)
problems,'' Bentsen said.
   ``But,'' he said, trying to make that compatible with Dukakis'
promise of an activist government, ``Washington can lead.''
   Bentsen promised the convention of the National Conference of
State Legislators that a Dukakis-Bentsen administration would not
be ``imperial and overbearing.'' He said Dukakis, as a governor,
understood that problem and he, as a Texan, understood the West.
   ``I think what you see in a candidate like myself, one from a
state like Texas, which shares a lot of the Western concerns and
objectives, is someone who can converse on the problems with an
experience and background that has compatibility,'' he told
reporters.
   By putting him on the ticket, Bentsen said Dukakis was ``saying
to Democrats who went and voted for Reagan, come home, there's a
place for you in this party.''
   Dukakis, he said, would ``see that Westerners were very much a
part of the administration and in highly responsible positions,
Bentsen said, adding that he would push for that also.
   The Democratic ticket lost all but Minnesota and the District of
Columbia four years ago. Although no schedule has yet been made,
the Dukakis campaign plans to use Bentsen as a tool to lure back
not only his native Texas but also the Southwest, South and
California.
   Bentsen began his first solo tour as the vice presidential
nominee Wenesday in New Mexico and campaigned on Thursday in San
Francisco prior to his Reno trip. He planned to visit a child care
center in Los Angeles today before heading to a rally in Amarillo,
Texas. Dukakis, meanwhile, was on a campaign swing through the
Midwest.
   The two men made a joint campaign trip immediately following
last week's Democratic National Convention with stops in Texas,
California, North Dakota, Missouri and Pennsylvania.
   In San Francisco on Thursday, Bentsen asked for union support of
the ticket at a convention of the United Food and Commercial
Workers.
   Bentsen got cheers from the crowed of 3,500 when he cited his
Senate record including this year's big fight with the Reagan
administration over the trade bill and the sixty-days notice for
plant closings.
   Bentsen said he expected Congress would be able to override the
president if he vetoes those bills. Earlier this year, when the two
measures were in a single package, Reagan's veto was sustained.

   Andy Mill says he used to enjoy watching
television broadcasts of Chris Evert's tennis matches and wanted to
meet her even though ``celebrities and athletes are a dime a
dozen.''
   On Saturday, the former Olympic skier plans to marry the tennis
star at a ceremony attended by about 100 family members and
friends, including tennis stars Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver
and actress Lynda Carter.
   When Mill first saw Evert in person on New Year's Eve in Aspen,
Colo., nearly 19 months ago, he said he fell in love.
   ``I was really curious about who this person was because, well,
celebrities and athletes are a dime a dozen,'' said Mill.
   Both Evert and Mill were ending eight-year marriages when they
met.
   Evert, 33, who was married to British tennis star John Lloyd,
has won three Wimbledon championships, six U.S. Opens and seven
French Opens. Mill, 35, placed sixth in the 1976 Olympic downhill
competition and 18th in the 1980 games.

   The Moody Blues has begun a nationwide tour to
mark the 20th anniversary of the English band's first U.S. tour.
   ``Our major success has been in America. A lot of Americans
think we are American,'' lead singer Justin Hayward said in an
interview Wednesday. ``We came here in 1968 when we had nothing
else going for us anywhere else.''
   Today their fame spans two generations.
   The Moody Blues, whose 1968 album ``Days of Future Passed''
pioneered the orchestrated rock 'n' roll album, get letters from
10-year-olds who are fans of their latest hit, ``I Know You're Out
There Somewhere.''
   Flutist Ray Thomas and drummer Graeme Edge are the only original
members from the group's 1964 start in Birmingham, England. The
current tour began here Wednesday night at the Kings Island
amusement park.

   Eleven years ago this month, singer
Tony Orlando stunned his audience and his two partners when he
walked out in the middle of a performance.
   On Tuesday night, Orlando and Dawn reunited on stage at Trump
Plaza Hotel and Casino, where they will continue through tonight.
   Two months ago Orlando took the first step toward an on-stage
reconciliation with the two performers who comprised Dawn _ Telma
Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson. He telephoned Ms. Hopkins and
asked her point-blank if she would consider a limited tour.
   Ms. Hopkins did not hesitate to answer. ``Let's do it,'' she
said.
   When the trio started rehearsing, Wilson said, ``It was like
we'd never stopped singing.''
   Among the group's million-selling hits from 1970 to 1977 were
``Candida,'' ``Knock Three Times'' and ``Tie A Yellow Ribbon
('Round The Old Oak Tree).''

   Actor Robert Urich is upset that his fame
is being used to promote the sale of a house he rented briefly.
   ``It's unethical, un-neighborly and dishonest because I was
never told about the ad and I never considered it my house,'' said
Urich, star of the former ``Spenser: For Hire'' TV series.
   Urich, 41, his wife and their two children rented the 11-room
English Tudor house for $4,000 a month between October 1986 and
July 1987 while waiting for their own home to be remodeled.
   Newspaper advertisements by Saperstein Company Auctioneers of
Boston state: ``11-room luxury home in Andover, formerly rented by
actor Robert Urich, star of `Spenser: For Hire.'''
   Douglas Ahern, the real estate developer who owns the house,
said he's surprised Urich is upset and that no offense was meant.
   ``Real estate agents in Beverly Hills can sell a house that Rock
Hudson lived in for two months and they call it Rock Hudson's
house,'' he said.

   Documents disclosing details of the massive
Defense Department contract fraud inquiry will remain secret, a
federal judge ruled Thursday, rejecting bids by news organizations
to make the information public.
   The Los Angeles Times and Copley Newspapers attorneys said they
will appeal the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon accepted a government argument
that unsealing search warrants and their accompanying affidavits
might hinder completion of the wide-ranging fraud investigation.
   ``The court does not wish to minimize the importance of the role
of the press, especially in matters of extreme public interest such
as the investigation concerned herein,'' said Kenyon.
   ``However, the court finds that, on balance, the public's
interest in a complete and uninhibited investigation strongly
outweighs its need for or right of access to the search warrant
affidavits at this time,'' he said.
   The documents in question detail searches conducted June 14 at
Northrop Corp., Teledyne Electronics, Litton Industries and the
home of defense consultant Fred Lackner. The only segments released
by the government were introductions showing that wiretaps had been
used.
   The massive government probe, which became public last month,
centers on allegations that defense industry consultants bribed
Pentagon officials for information that helped contractors win
multimillion-dollar contracts.
   Kenyon overruled an earlier decision by U.S. Magistrate Joseph
Reichmann who held that the public had a right to know details of
such an investigation, which affects operation of the U.S.
government.
   U.S. District Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly in Bridgeport, Conn.,
Thursday also denied a newspaper's request to unseal documents that
are part of the investigation.
   ``There is a right under the First Amendment of access to court
documents,'' Daly said in denying The Hartford Courant's motion
that the affidavits used to gain search warrants for Norden
Systems' offices be unsealed. ``But at this early stage, the right
is a qualified and limited one.''
   Norden is a subsidiary of Hartford-based United Technologies
Corp. It is suspected of benefitting from inside information to
build a battlefield communication system for the Marines, according
to other documents already released in the investigation.

<HEAD>President Tells Young Evangelicals Abortions `Must Stop'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan praised a child care proposal
by Vice President George Bush, calling it a means of allowing women
to choose to stay home with their children if they want.
   Reagan told a group of evangelical young people Thursday the
plan would ``strengthen the family'' because ``the basic idea here
is that the government would simply let families keep up to $1,000
more of their own money.''
   ``That's money the family itself can decide how to spend,''
Reagan said. ``Working mothers could put the money toward child
care. But by giving each family this tax credit the vice
president's plan would also permit thousands of mothers to choose
to stay home with their children.''
   It was Reagan's first comment on the proposal, which Bush is
making part of his own presidential campaign.
   In the speech to the Student Congress on Evangelism at the
Washington Convention Center, Reagan also reiterated his opposition
to abortion, saying, ``We cannot proclaim the noble ideal that
human life is sacred, then turn our backs on the taking of some
4,000 unborn children's lives every day.
   ``This must stop,'' the president said. ``An abortion is the
taking of a human life.
   ``Many who seek abortions do so in harrowing circumstances,'' he
added. ``And just as tolerance means accepting that many in good
faith hold views different from our own, it also means that no man
or woman should sit in judgment on another.
   ``I believe - and Vice President Bush believes with me - that we
must rise above bitterness and reproach to find positive answers to
the tragedy of abortion.''
   Reagan said his administration has sought to reflect a ``return
to basic values'' through such steps as the enactment by Congress
of the Equal Access Act of 1984, giving voluntary religious groups
the right to meet after school on the same basis as other groups.
He also cited longstanding administration positions in support of
returning prayer to the classroom and reversing the Supreme Court
decision that legalized abortions.
   He said legislation his administration has submitted to deal
with child pornography is being held up in Congress, and asked,
``If the House and Senate leadership really care about family
values, isn't it time they brought this anti-pornography
legislation to a vote?''
   He also talked to the young men and women about the pressures
teen-agers feel to have sex out of wedlock.
   ``I'm sure that each of you believes that someday you'll find
someone to fall in love with _ and you will,'' he said. ``You know
that when you meet that person, and meet in a marriage, that you
will be true to each other. Well, did you ever stop to think you
can start being true to that one special person beginning now?''
   The 8,000 young people cheered wildly, applauded, stamped their
feet and jumped up and down as the president made his appearance in
the cavernous hall.
   He opened by leading the group in the pledge of allegiance to
the American flag, and ended by joining others in the crowd in
waving a small flashlight in an effort to keep time to the music as
the group sang a song proclaiming, ``We will carry the torch of the
Lord.''

<HEAD>Eight Indicted In Plot To Illegally Divert Libyan Government Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arraignments are scheduled for next week
for six Libyans and two other Arab nationals charged with plotting
to use Libyan government money to recruit dissident support in the
United States.
   The eight were indicted by a federal grand jury on Thursday, and
are scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 5.
   The 40-count indictment did not make any mention of previous
accusations that one of the defendants, Mousa Hawamda, took part in
a plot to assassinate a senior U.S. official. The target of the
alleged plot has been identified as Oliver North, who helped plan
the 1986 aerial bombing of Libya.
   Hawamda, a Washington travel agency owner, was charged with
asking another defendant, Adel Sennosi, to gather personal
information about a high-ranking government official for the
Revolutionary Committee in Libya, which is an intelligence agency.
   All eight, who were arrested last week by the FBI following a
yearlong probe, are charged with laundering money and violating the
1986 Libyan sanctions regulations which prohibit travel to and
transactions with Libya.
   In a related development, U.S. District Court Judge James
Cacheris ordered two leaders of the American Indian Movement jailed
until they agree to testify before the grand jury that is
continuing its investigation into the Libyan case.
   The two, Vernon Bellecourt and William Means, were promised
immunity from prosecution but refused to testify in protest over
the government's wire tapping of their phones and what they said
were other violations of their rights.
   Bellecourt, of the White Earth Chippewa Nation from northern
Minnesota, said he visited Libya several times and was one of the
organizers of a 1987 rally in Tripoli marking the first anniversary
of the U.S. bombing.
   The case against the eight Arabs accuses them of violating a
special license granted by the Treasury Department that allows
Libya to send money for its estimated 250 students in the United
States.
   The People's Committee for Libyan Students, which administers
the money, allegedly used it to organize support among American
Indians and Black Moslems, including travel to Libya and
anti-American demonstrations in Washington.
   The indictment charges that the PCLS was used ``to further
revolutionary policy ... by recruiting and funding members of
selected American groups and by gathering intelligence
information.''
   Hawamda, who is a naturalized American with Jordanian
citizenship, allegedly used his Manara travel agency in downtown
Washington to supply false billings and make travel arrangements
for the Indians.
   Seven of the defendants were accused of being Libyan agents
masquerading as students in the United States. The eighth, Manhal
Ben Mohamed, is a Moroccan employee at Manara and Hawamda's
brother-in-law.
   The other defendants are: Saleh Al-Rajhi, Salem Omar Zubeidy,
Milad Shibani, Mahdi Abousetta, Ramadan Belgasem and Adel Sennosi.
   All six Libyans are current or former officers of the PCLS.
   One of the six, Saleh Al-Rajhi, was accused by U.S. Attorney
Henry Hudson last week of gathering information on U.S.
intelligence officials for use by Libya in retaliation for the 1986
U.S. bombing. No mention of this was made in the indictment.

Jerusalem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A clenched fist thrust inside a Star of David
is their insignia, a symbol of their anger and their allegiance.
   Loaded guns and lengthy arrest records represent their
willingness to express both.
   ``The Arabs are more afraid of us than the police,'' says Shmuel
Herman, an immigrant to Israel from Elizabeth, N.J. ``We have a
freer hand.''
   Herman is a member of the Committee for Safe Roads, an innocuous
name for a militant group whose armed patrols in Arab sectors of
Jerusalem have stirred emotions in this divided city.
   The group is made up of followers of American-born Rabbi Meir
Kahane and his Kach movement, which advocates expelling all Arabs
from Israeli-controlled territory.
   They patrol in vans and on foot in defiance of police, who have
arrested 20 of the vigilantes in six days. Some officials fear the
group will provoke violence between the Holy City's 135,000
Palestinians and 340,000 Jews.
   ``They are absolutely irresponsible elements and one has to do
everything to stop them,'' Mayor Teddy Kollek said on Israel radio
this week.
   On one patrol Thursday, four men whose ages range from 16 to 24
drove through Arab east Jerusalem to the Jewish community of Neve
Yaacov and escorted bus No. 25, often a target of Arab stoning
attacks, to the center of the city.
   Shmuel Ben Yishai, organizer of the patrols, said many Jews
appreciate the efforts of his committee. He was among those
detained and warned by police, but he said that if he catches a
Palestinian stone-thrower, ``I will break his arm.''
   All 20 of those detained were freed on bail of up to $3,750
after being charged with incitement, and most are patroling again.
   On Thursday, the van drove slowly past mosques, Palestinian
restaurants, stores and homes in east Jerusalem. The four men
looked out the windows. A 9mm handgun rested on the dashboard.
   As it passed three Arab workers eating lunch beneath a tree,
22-year-old Shmuel Dayan, formerly of Minneapolis, Minn., shouted:
``We're from Kahane!''
   Herman, also one of the men arrested, says the volunteer patrols
literally look for trouble.
   ``We keep our eyes open for some suspicious-looking Arab,
someone who looks around like a thief in America. Then we drive
back and forth. If we catch them trying to hurt an Israeli, we
rough them up. Sometimes, we put them in the trunk of the car and
take them to the police.''
   Herman, 24, said the committee has about 100 volunteers in
Jerusalem, 80 in the West Bank and 60 in Haifa, the northern port
city.
   They saw no suspicious Palestinians on Thursday's hour-long
patrol, however.
   ``It's a shame. I wanted to see some action,'' Herman said.
   Kahane's supporters began citizen convoys in March 1987 _
generally in the occupied West Bank, where most of them live as
settlers _ and began patrolling Jerusalem last week.
   Arab east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war and
has annexed, has become a focal point of the rebellion against
Israeli rule in the occupied territories.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million
Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, more than 230
Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed.
   The road committee's symbol, the fist inside a Star of David,
illustrates its philosophy that Jews must be tough to survive, even
in Israel.
   Supporters of Kach hope the image of a protector of Jews will
help in November's election. Kahane now is its only representative
in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
   Like most Kahane supporters, Herman believe peace with the Arabs
is not possible because ``they don't want it.''
   Dayan said he is prepared for violence.
   ``We weren't put on this Earth to live happily and peacefully,''
he said. ``We were put here to study the Bible and to hold on to
our land.''

   A garden snake that startled a
one-legged man triggered a series of events that left his car and
house in flames.
   The 3-foot, non-poisonous snake was napping under the front seat
of Al Fitzwater's car, but awoke when the Fort Wayne man climbed
behind the wheel Thursday to test the engine he'd been repairing.
   ``The snake bit me on the ankle,'' said Fitzwater, 45, who lost
his right leg in a hang-gliding accident in 1975. ``I started
stomping it and hit the gas, and then the car lunged forward.''
   The car accelerated into the rear of Fitzwater's house, spilling
a can of gas that was open on its bumper and causing flames to
shoot out of the open carburetor.
   The ensuing blaze quickly enveloped the front of Fitzwater's car
and leaped to his home.
   ``I was lucky,'' Fitzwater said. ``The car started again and I
backed it away, then got out.''
   A passerby notified the Fort Wayne Fire Department, which
brought the blaze under control about 30 minutes after it began.
   While firefighters fought to smother the last of the flames, the
snake was still curled inside the front seat of the abandoned car.
Next to a fire truck parked in front of his home, Fitzwater sat in
his wheelchair watching the smoke and shaking his head
incredulously.
   ``I can't believe that damn thing's still alive.''

<HEAD>Brazilian Ministers Quit in Constitutional Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Cabinet ministers joined a third
colleague and quit in a growing dispute over the nation's proposed
constitution, a presidential aide said.
   Culture Minister Celso Furtado and Science and Technology
Minister Luiz Henrique da Silveira handed in their resignations
Thursday, said a presidential aide who spoke on condition of
anonymity. He said he did not know why they had resigned.
   Renato Archer, the Social Welfare minister, quit Wednesday.
   The resignations came after President Jose Sarney on Tuesday
attacked the constitution, proposed by lawmakers after 18 months of
work, as ``chaotic.'' He said it could make Brazil impossible to
govern.
   Despite Sarney's broadcast, legislators overwhelmingly approved
the rough draft of the new constitution late Wednesday.
   The document includes proposals to limit annual interest rates
to 12 percent, to give Brazilians control of all mining operations,
to cut the voting age from 18 to 16, and to grant the unrestricted
right to strike and a six-hour work day.
   
   The three ministers' resignations deepened a split between the
president and Ulysses Guimaraes, the powerful speaker of the House
of Representatives and president of the 559-member Constitutional
Assembly.
   All three ministers are close personal friends of Guimaraes, who
responded to Sarney's criticisms with a sharply-worded defense of
the assembly's work.
   Tuesday's broadcast was Sarney's last-ditch attempt to remove
several proposals from the new document that will replace a 1969
constitution handed down by military generals. The military has
raised objections to the constitution.
   Lawmakers now can amend the document in a second round of voting
expected to end in September.
   Agrarian Reform Minister Jader Barbalho will be the new Social
Welfare minister, the presidential spokesman said. Education
Minister Hugo Napoleao will head the Culture Ministry, and the
Technology Ministry will be headed by Luiz Rico Vicente.

   The fire that destroyed the
home of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela was prompted by a
dispute between black teen-age groups and was not aimed at Mandela
himself, sources said.
   Police said as many as 50 black high school students stoned the
house, doused it with gasoline and set it ablaze Thursday. No one

   Neighbors and black journalists, speaking on condition of

school in Soweto and were involved in a dispute Wednesday with
young blacks who guard the home.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, a prominent anti-apartheid activist, was
bound for a news conference concerning detainees when she learned
of the fire. Her daughter, Zindzi, 27, and her two grandchildren,
who also live at the four-room home, were away at the time.
   State of emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest,
security force action, treatment of detainees, some forms of
protest and a range of statements classified as subversive.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, said leaders in Soweto and other black
townships had been asked ``to call upon the community not to act
emotionally so they do not create a situation where there is a
spiral of violence.''
   He leaders would try to talk to the principal and the students
of the school involved to ease the situation. He said young men who
congregate around the Mandela home were told ``not to act without
thinking or with revenge.''
   Mrs. Mandela arrived by car about an hour later and viewed the
blackened windows and burned furniture in the yard from inside the
car. She then was driven to her nearby offices where she conducts
social welfare projects.
   Youths who guarded the house, some wearing jackets of the
Mandela United soccer club sponsored by the family, pushed
journalists away from the office. One threatened to burn a
photographer's car.
   Later, attorney Amrichand Soma told reporters Mandela was
reached at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, where he is serving a
life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the
white-dominated government, and said no statement should be made.
   For Mrs. Mandela, the fire was one of many hardships since her
husband, a leader of the outlawed African National Congress, was
jailed in 1962. Mandela, 70, received a life sentence in 1964 after
being convicted of plotting a sabotage campaign to overthrow the
white-led government.
   Mrs. Mandela, 54, has spent 17 months in solitary confinement,
lived in isolation, been arrested several times and passed
virtually her entire adult life under stringent police restrictions
and public scrutiny.
   She was trained as a social worker. She has become a leading
campaigner against apartheid and black activists often call her
``Mother of the Nation.''
   Another result of her prominence is that some of her personal
hardships become public events.
   When she visits her husband in prison, journalists are present.
   By the time she reached her burned-out home Thursday it was
surrounded by firefighters, police and journalists who already had
wandered through the smoldering remains.
   Mrs. Mandela moved into the modest four-room bungalow in Soweto,
Johannesburg's huge black township, after she married Mandela in
1958. Mandela had owned the house and lived in it since the 1940s.
   It has been shot at and stoned by attackers who have not been
identified. Police visit it regularly.

<HEAD>Jackson Issues `Humanitarian Plea' for Hostage Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's latest efforts to obtain the
release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon was coolly received by
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   Dukakis, during a campaign stop in Cleveland, said he didn't
know all the facts about Jackson's effort, ``but as a general
matter private citizens should not try to conduct foreign policy.''
   The Democratic nominee said the Reagan administration and the
U.N. should handle the hostage issue and said a quick end to the
nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war would expedite the release of the
hostages.
   ``I think they are beginning to make some progress,'' on an end
to the war, Dukakis said. ``I think the secretary-general of the
U.N. is the person to provide that mediation.''
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, campaigning
in Reno, Nev., echoed Dukakis' views, saying, ``I normally under
most conditions like to see officials of the government carrying
out any negotiations.
   ``I must say Jesse Jackson has ... been very effective at times
in the past in doing some of these things,'' the Texas senator
added.
   Jackson said he issued an appeal through U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to impress upon Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati that the release of the hostages is ``moral and
humanitarian.''
   He said he asked de Cuellar ``to appeal to the foreign minister
to hear our humanitarian plea _ to hear our mercy appeal _ and to
use his strength to help gain the release of the Americans held
hostage.''
   Jackson said ``no meeting has been set, and no meeting has been
sought'' for him to negotiate with Iranian officials.
   At the United Nations, Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar
Mahallati said the country's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati,
will not meet with Jackson to discuss the possible release of
hostages.
   Velayati was at the United Nations to discuss ending the
Iran-Iraq war.
   On Tuesday, Iran's parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani,
offered to help get the nine Americans freed if the United States
would release Iranian assets frozen since 1979. The Reagan
administration responded that it will make no deals for the
hostages' release.
   The hostages are believed to be held by Shiite Moslems with
links to Iran.
   Jackson had said he is using several Middle Eastern diplomats as
intermediaries in his attempts to negotiate the hostages' release.
   In January 1984, Jackson met directly with President Hafez Assad
of Syria and arranged the release of Navy Lt. Robert O. Goodman
Jr., whose plane was shot down over Lebanon Dec. 4, 1983, during an
American air strike against a Syrian anti-aircraft position.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police raided an apartment before
dawn today and arrested eight people, including renegade soldiers,
believed linked to ousted President Ferdinand Marcos, officials
said.
   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy commander of the National Capital
Regional Defense Command, said police seized one claymore mine,
plastic explosives and improvised bombs that may have been intended
for terror attacks in the capital.
   Oxales said the raid at about 4:30 a.m. was in a crowded
neighborhood of suburban Caloocan City. He said the eight included
two women and at least two army enlisted men.
   Two or three others escaped, and ``some tried to escape by
climbing the walls and climbing to the rooftop,'' he said.
   Oxales said the eight were being interrogated and could face
charges of illegal possession of weapons and explosives.
   Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for 20 years, was deposed in
February 1986 in a civilian-military uprising that swept President
Corozon Aquino to power.
   Oxales said one of those arrested was linked to an abortive
April 1987 raid on Fort Bonifacio, which the military said was an
attempt to free rebel troops jailed in a coup attempt three months
before.
   The government said the January 1987 coup attempt was aimed at
restoring Marcos to power. The attempt included attacks on media
and military facilities in the Manila area.
   Oxales said some of those arrested were also suspected of
involvement in a similar raid last June on Camp Crame, where
mutineers failed to free jailed coup plotters but made off with two
dozen rifles.
   He said raiders also found street maps and other diagrams that
they suspected may have been used in planning bombings within the
capital.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Aquino's chief aide accused Marcos of trying
to evade U.S. prosecution by offering $5 billion to come home.
   ``We saw it for what it was. It was just a ploy to get his U.S.
indictment against him suspended,'' Executive Secretary Catalino
Macaraig said.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow the former president to return
from exile in Hawaii.
   In New York, The Village Voice reported this month that U.S.
attorney Rudolph Giuliani recommended that Marcos and his wife
Imelda be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection
with real estate acquisitions in New York.

<HEAD>Messer Executed For 1979 Murder Of Niece</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted in the stabbing death of his
8-year-old niece was put to death in Georgia's electric chair,
prompting the victim's mother to remark, ``We can finally put our
baby to rest.''
   James Messer Jr. died a little more than an hour after the U.S.
Supreme Court, in a 7-2 vote, refused to stop the execution.
Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan dissented, but
there was no immediate elaboration from the court.
   Prosecutors said Messer abducted Rhonda Joan Tanner from her
school in 1979 and tried to molest her. She bled to death after
being beaten and stabbed.
   The victim's father, Wayne Tanner, 47, said Messer's execution
was a ``big relief. He finally paid.''
   Messer, 34, was pronounced dead at 7:23 p.m., said Department of
Corrections spokesman John Siler. He was the 13th person to die in
the state's electric chair since Georgia resumed executions in 1983
and the 101st person put to death since the Supreme Court allowed
states to restore capital punishment in 1976.
   ``We feel we can finally put our baby to rest,'' said the
victim's mother, Joyce Tanner, 45, of Cedartown, one of about 20
death penalty advocates who carried placards and demonstrated in
front of the prison Thursday.
   Messer declined to make a final statement, but requested a
prayer. Prison Chaplain Nolan LaVell placed his hands on Messer's
left forearm and delivered a one-minute prayer while the condemned
man held his eyes tightly shut.
   At the conclusion of the prayer, Messer said, ``Amen'' and that
was his last word.
   Fourteen people witnessed the execution, including seven state
witnesses, one of Messer's attorneys, Howard Manchell, and six
media representatives.
   Outside the prison, 12 anti-death penalty protesters sang.
Nearly twice as many pro-death penalty demonstrators, including one
man wearing a white Ku Klu Klan robe, cheered and clapped when
Messer's body was driven out of the prison in a hearse.
   Messer did not ask for any witnesses to the execution, Siler
said. His mother, Mary Messer of LaGrange, and an aunt visited him
at the prison Wednesday.
   Earlier Thursday, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles
refused to commute Messer's sentence to life in prison. Chairman
Wayne Snow said the panel concluded ``there are insufficient
grounds for further consideration'' of the commutation rquest.
   Snow said the board rejected a psychiatrist's testimony that
Messer's ``explosive'' behavior may have been caused by brain
damage. Messer exhibited no such behavior in prison, he said, and
the testimony was ``not a matter that we can base a decision on a
crime that occurred nine years ago.''

<HEAD>`L.A. Law,' `Golden Girls' and New Shows Dominate Emmy List</HEAD>

   The legal power plays portrayed in
the pin-striped world of ``L.A. Law'' and the shenanigans of ``The
Golden Girls'' led Emmy contenders in nominations for television
excellence.
   Cable shows won 15 nominations in their first outing against the
networks, and a surprising 22 were garnered by two new shows _ the
forbidden life of ``Beauty and the Beast'' beneath New York and
``thirtysomething,'' which focuses on the ups and downs of the baby
boomer generation.
   It was the gripping courtroom and corridor intrigue of ``L.A.
Law'' and its polished cast that earned 19 nominations for the 40th
annual Emmy Awards.
   ``We have good stories and that great ensemble group,'' producer
Steven Bochco said. ``We draw inspiration from their ability.''
   Noteworthy, too, were two NBC shows overlooked by the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences: Only one nomination was given TV's
most-watched series ``The Cosby Show'' and its spin-off ``A
Different World'' got none.
   Last year's trendy ``Moonlighting,'' a nominations leader last
year, was also fading, capturing six nominations and none in major
categories.
   NBC led the networks with 114 nominations, followed by CBS with
87 and ABC with 75. The Fox Broadcasting Co., the so-called
``fourth network,'' collected six Emmy nominations. Syndicated
shows were nominated 13 times.
   Among cable companies, Home Box Office and Showtime each claimed
six nominations. The Disney Channel drew two nominations and Turner
Broadcasting System had one. Shows on the Public Broadcasting
Service were nominated 27 times.
   Fox will broadcast the Emmy ceremony Aug. 28 from the Pasadena
Civic Auditorium.
   ``L.A. Law'' was selected in the categories of best drama
series, best actor in a drama series for Michael Tucker and Corbin
Bernsen and best actress in a drama series for Jill Eikenberry and
Susan Dey.
   The on-screen and real life husband-wife duo Michael Tucker and
Jill Eikenberry, called the ``Tucker-Berrys'' by the ``L.A. Law''
crew, were out of town. Tucker was doing a film in Montreal and his
wife was in North Carolina.
   Betty White, who won three years ago for her ``Golden Girls''
role, said of her third nomination for best actress in a comedy
series: ``I don't take it lightly. It's your peer group saying they
like you.''
   NBC's comedy ``Cheers'' received 11 nominations, including one
for new cast member Kirstie Alley for best actress in a comedy
series. The 10 for ABC's ``thirtysomething'' was a surprise for its
producers.
   ``We're thrilled and surprised that a new show has generated
this kind of recognition,'' said co-producer Marshall Herskovitz.
   Actor Tim Busfield, nominated for supporting actor in
``thirtysomething,'' was named for an episode involving marriage
counseling.
   ``I owe this to all the women I've ever had fights with,'' he
said.
   The ``L.A. Law'' sweep came despite a divisive flap that began
last year between series co-creators Bochco and Terry Louise
Fisher. At one point, Fisher was barred from the ``L.A. Law''
offices. She subsequently was forced to quit the show. But Fisher
received two nominations for ``L.A. Law'' scripts while Bochco had
just one.
   Joining ``L.A. Law'' in the best drama series competition will
be ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``St. Elsewhere'' and
``thirtysomething.'' ``L.A. Law'' won last year.
   Nominated for best comedy program were ``Cheers,'' ``Frank's
Place,'' NBC's ``Night Court,'' ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' and last
year's winner, ``The Golden Girls.''
   ``We're jumping up and down here. I was watching the `Today
Show' and during the break the local news announced the
nominations. We started jumping, said producer Tony Thomas of ``The
Golden Girls'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.
   Ann Jillian was overwhelmed by two nominations won by the NBC
movie ``The Ann Jillian Story,'' including leading actress in a
miniseries or special and best drama-comedy special. It dealt with
her battle with breast cancer.
   ``I'm very honored and very thrilled, but the nomination isn't
for me. It goes for all those ladies who had to go through this. I
tried to do this with dignity and above all hope. I'm so grateful.''
   Named for best miniseries were ``Baby M,'' ``Gore Vidal's
Lincoln,'' ``Billionaire Boys Club'' and ``The Murder of Mary
Phagan.''
   For best variety music or comedy program, the nominees were CBS'
``Irving Berlin's 100th Birthday Celebration,'' CBS' ``The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour,'' Fox's ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' and two
episodes of NBC's ``Late Night With David Letterman.''
   The Board of Governors award this year goes to cartoon masters
William Hannah and Joseph Barbera.
   Cable shows were eligible for Emmys this year because national
cable networks are now available to more than 50 percent of the
country.

<HEAD>Drought Shouldn't Hurt US Role As Food Exporter, Agriculture
Secretary Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Drought Relief, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the drought, U.S. food exporters this
year can remain reliable sources for foreign nations that depend on
them and should make it their top priority to do so, says
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.
   ``This year, even though our crops are way down, combining our
crops with our carryover, we'll have an ample supply for both our
domestic and our export needs,'' Lyng said Thursday at an
Illinois-Japan agricultural trade conference.
   Japan, which depends on imports for 50 percent of its food, is
the ``best customer of U.S. agriculture,'' Lyng said.
   The Japanese are expected to buy $6.5 billion in U.S.
agricultural products this year, said Mark Randal, spokesman for
the Illinois Department of Agriculture, co-sponsor of the
conference.
   ``If you think about Japan's huge purchases from the United
States and their dependence upon us, we must make it clear that ...
even in a year when we have a drought ... we will not restrict
exports to protect purchases within our own country,'' Lyng said.
   ``It's absolutely essential that we assure Japan that we will
have enough, that we will be responsible,'' he added in his
15-minute talk to about 200 people at the conference, co-sponsored
by the Japan Economic Institute of America Inc.
   Lyng said the United States owes a ``debt of gratitude'' to the
Japanese for their recent agreement to dismantle many of the trade
barriers to U.S. products such as beef, citrus fruits, juices, ice
cream, processed cheeses and sugar-based goods.
   ``I compliment the Japanese for their effort to modernize and
update and improve their access,'' he said at a news conference
after his talk. ``It's not easy for them to do that.''
   Nobuo Matsunaga, Japanese ambassador to the United States, said
Americans need to be aggressive in their marketing efforts to his
country, because there are many foreign competitors.
   He reiterated Lyng's call for reliability among U.S. suppliers,
noting that past U.S. export restrictions still evoke ``bitter''
memories.
   In the early 1970s, a feared shortage of soybeans in the United
States prompted an embargo that forced Japan unexpectedly to seek
other markets to fulfill its high demand for soybean products,
Randal said.
   Lyng said U.S. law as well as Reagan administration policy now
supports unrestricted international trade regardless of conditions
at home.
   On the topic of drought relief for American farmers, Lyng said
the $6 billion measure approved in Congress is ``a pretty good
bill,'' despite some provisions the Reagan administration opposes
and some efforts by lobbyists to use the legislation for special
interests.

   The ruling Sandinista party's
newspaper saluted a convoy of U.S. veterans that brought food,
medicine and clothing with a banner headline reading, ``Veterans
Break Boycott.''
   The newspaper Barricada said in its Thursday edition that
thousands of people greeted the convoy of 20 vehicles and 44
activists when it crossed the Honduran-Nicaraguan border the day
before, after months of opposition from the U.S. government.
   The Veterans' Peace Convoy was scheduled to arrive in Managua's
downtown Revolution Plaza today, where it will turn over its
shipment to the leftist government.
   The veterans oppose U.S. support of Nicaraguan Contra rebels,
who have waged a 7-year-old war to topple the Sandinista government.
   The U.S. Customs Service opposed letting the convoy cross the
U.S.-Mexico border, saying taking the vehicles to Nicaragua would
violate a 1985 trade embargo. Humanitarian aid is permitted under
the embargo, but the Customs Service says the vehicles must return
to the United States.
   The newspaper said U.S. police ``brutally repressed'' the group
in its attempt to bring ``medicine, food and clothes for Nicaraguan
children butchered by the war action of the Reagan administration.''
   Eight members of the group were arrested July 9 when they
refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a Rio Grande
bridge crossing in Laredo, Texas. The convoy finally crossed the
Mexican border at Nuevo Laredo on July 14.
   The Customs Service said the trucks must return to the United
States within 30 days or convoy members will face fines of up to
$50,000 and 10 years in prison. The veterans refused to sign forms
promising they would return the trucks.
   In June, U.S. Customs officials stopped the original convoy of
38 vehicles from crossing into Mexico. About 100 convoy
participants drove to Washington to rally against Customs'
decision, circling around the White House and in front of the State
Department in three days of protest.

<HEAD>Parliament Remains Divided On New Abortion Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament rejected proposals for a new abortion
law ranging from freedom of choice to a ban except in cases of a
threat to the pregnant woman's life.
   Also Thursday, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled that a
fetus is not a person.
   The national government began searching for a new abortion law
after the Supreme Court in January struck down Canada's restrictive
abortion law. The lack of a new law has brought abortion-on-demand
to many cities and led to angry protests from anti-abortion groups.
   Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government, itself
split on the issue, proposed a compromise in which abortion would
be easy to obtain early in pregnancy but restricted later on.
   That proposal was defeated 147 to 76, and other proposed
measures also fell. The voting followed a two-day debate, and the
issue now goes back to the drawing board.
   Opposition parties criticized Mulroney for staying out of the
debate or revealing his own views. But with a general election
expected this fall, Mulroney can go to voters saying that he tried
to propose a compromise.
   The British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled Thursday that a
newborn becomes a person only after it leaves the mother's body
alive.
   The decision overturned the conviction of two midwives charged
with criminal negligence in the death of a fetus in 1985.
   But the court upheld their conviction on charges of causing
bodily harm to the pregnant woman.
   The Canadian Supreme Court is expected to deliver its view this
fall on whether a fetus has any rights.

<TEXT>
   The former Honduran ambassador to Panama faces a
possible life sentence after pleading guilty to charges of
attempting to smuggle 26 pounds of cocaine hidden in coffee bags in
his luggage.
   Rigoberto Regalado Lara, 49, was arrested May 15 at Miami
International Airport and immediately stripped of his diplomatic
immunity by Honduran officials.
   Regalado had initially pleaded innocent, but on Thursday he told
U.S. District Court Judge Edward B. Davis he wanted to change his
plea to guilty of importing cocaine.
   In return, Assistant U.S. Attorney Toby Vick said the government
was dropping a second charge of possession with intent to
distribute.
   Davis warned Regalado that he faces at least 10 years in prison
and could be sentenced to life, as well as fined $4 million on the
importation charge. He asked the former ambassador if he understood.
   ``Yes, your honor, I do,'' Regalado responded through an
interpreter. Davis set sentencing for Sept. 14.
   Vick refused to comment on the case or the plea bargain, but
federal sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
investigation was continuing.
   Regalado has been held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center south of Miami since his arrest.
   Honduran authorities cooperated with U.S. drug investigators in
the case, and even threatened to try Regalado in his homeland if he
tried to return there.
   Prosecutors had asked he be held without bond prior to his plea
because Honduras has no extradition treaty with the United States.

<TEXT>
   Ten days after their arrests during the
Democratic National Convention, 96 anti-abortion protesters who
refuse to give their names remain jailed, most vowing to stay until
their next court date or the city frees them.
   Lawyers said Thursday that the jailed protesters, charged with
criminal trespass, cannot be freed on bond until they give
verifiable proof of their identities.
   ``If we can identify them ... we can try them,'' explained Lee
O'Brien, Fulton County's chief assistant solicitor. He said the
offense carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a fine of
$1,000.
   ``Demonstrators like this ... do all they can to frustrate the
system,'' O'Brien said. ``If in so doing they are willing to spend
more time in jail than they would have, if any, so be it. It really
depends on how far they want to carry it.''
   The protesters, part of an anti-abortion effort called Operation
Rescue, were among 134 arrested July 19 at a clinic near downtown
Atlanta where abortions are performed. The city began processing
them through the court system this week.
   ``We just hope the city will realize it made a mistake and just
let us go,'' said Lowell Patterson, a spokesman for the protesters
who is not jailed. ``We have served more time even than we would
have if we had been found guilty'' of criminal trespass.
   On Thursday, a man calling himself Baby John Doe 105 and a woman
calling herself Baby Jane Doe 111 clutched Bibles as they stood
silently in Municipal Court. A man calling himself Baby John Doe
132 was dressed as a priest.
   The protesters, who are being held at the Atlanta Corrections
Center, say they have taken the names in solidarity with aborted
fetuses.
   Judge Howard Johnson, however, referred to the prisoners as
``White Male 42,'' or ``White Female 47,'' as he methodically sent
their cases to state court.
   Thirty-two of those arrested last week have given their names
and been released on $500 recognizance bonds, said Tom Pocock,
deputy director of the corrections center. He said six others were
identified through other means.
   The demonstrators have been brought into court in groups of
seven or eight for their brief appearances before being returned to
jail.
   The remaining 23 demonstrators were to appear today.
   ``We have 75 percent of our people committed to stay (in jail)
until their court hearing, assuming it is within the next month or
so,'' said Patterson.
   It normally takes two to three months for such a case to reach
state court.
   ``Most of our local people are in jail,'' Patterson said.
Supporters are coming in from outside the Atlanta area, and there
would be large demonstrations in the coming weeks, he said, but
declined to elaborate.
   Similarly charged demonstrators arrested during an anti-nuclear
protest at U.S. Department of Energy offices during the convention
were sentenced to the five days they had spent awaiting a court
appearance and were freed.
   Robert Fierer, who is representing the demonstrators in court,
said he does not know whether some will reveal their identities to
get out of jail.
   ``These are people of conscience,'' he said this week. ``They
have to make their own decisions about these sorts of things.''

<HEAD>15 South Korean Delegates Named For Talks With North Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly today appointed
15 delegates for parliamentary talks with North Korea on various
tesion-easing measures and the Olympic Games.
   National Assembly officials said a South Korean letter proposing
the talks will be delivered to North Korea through Panmunjon, the
border truce site, on Monday.
   The letter will also ask North Korea to send an equal number of
delegates to the border village for the talks, the officials said.
   The naming of the delegates was endorsed today by the heads of
the nation's four main political parties, who approved plans for
the talks worked out by their aides earlier this week.
   North Korea has proposed that the full legislatures of the two
nations meet in August to discuss a non-aggression pact and
Pyongyang's possible entry into the Olympic Games in Seoul.
   In a letter delivered Thursday last week, North Korea suggested
the two sides skip working contacts to prepare for the joint
parliamentary conference. But Seoul officials say preliminary talks
are needed to set an agenda and other details.
   The delegates picked today _ six governing and nine opposition
lawmakers _would attend preliminary talks at Panmunjon in the
second week of August if North Korea agrees. Seoul officials
suggested a date between Aug. 13 and 15.
   The non-aggression pact and North Korea's demand to co-host the
Olympics would be high on the agenda, but South Korean delegates
also plan to raise other tension-easing measures, including
reuniting separated family members.
   North Korea has said it would boycott the Sept. 17-Oct. 2
Olympics unless its demand to co-host the Games is accepted.
   The International Olympic Committee rejected the demand, saying
the Olympics are awarded to a single city.
   The two Koreas remain as bitter rivals since the division of the
Korean land at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought the
three-year Korean War that ended in standoff in 1953.

dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier was acquitted of charges he fatally
shot a 21-year-old waitress, and her father tried to kill himself
when the case ended, Radio Haiti Inter said.
   Joseph Louis stood on the front steps of the Palace of Justice
and slashed his throat with a razor blade, the independent radio
station said Thursday. He was rushed to State University Hospital
in Port-au-Prince, where he was reported in stable condition.
   The radio said Louis tried to kill himself Wednesday after a
jury acquitted Serge Gaston, 45, a former member of the dreaded
Tonton Mocoutes militia, in the killing of Louis' daughter, Ingrid.
   She was shot and killed by two gunmen firing from a speeding car
in front of the capital's Tiffany restaurant, where she worked, on
Jan. 31, 1986 _ one week before Duvalier was ousted and fled to
France. The motive for the killing was not known.
   Gaston originally was convicted last year and sentenced to death
in the killing, but an Appeals Court overturned the conviction on a
legal technicality and ordered a retrial.
   The Appeals Court retrial was held Wednesday, and the jury
acquitted Gaston after two witnesses failed to show up for
unexplained reasons, Radio Haiti Inter reported.
   The witnesses, Jacques Delmas and Camille Eustache, swore they
saw Gaston and another Macoute in the car from which gunfire was
sprayed at Miss Louis and other restaurant employees. The second
Macoute was not captured.
   Haiti Inter said the jury expressed hostility toward the
victim's father, and the prosecuting attorney did not press the
defense witnesses with questions.
   Several spectators marched out of the courtroom in disgust
before the jury acquitted Gaston, the radio station said.

   Hundreds of unashamed men and women are
gathering for a convention at a remote campground this weekend to
elect officers, organize committees _ and get naked.
   Along with serious business, the free-wheeling nudists of the
Eastern Sunbathing Association _ and their equally unabashed
children _ plan to lie in the sun, swim and play ping-pong,
shuffleboard and volleyball.
   ``Looking is not a no-no, but staring is,'' said Turner Stokes,
60, of Leesburg, Va., an electronics engineer and president of the
larger American Sunbathing Association. ``I'm sure the staring is
much worse out among the `textiles.'''
   ``Textiles,'' the nudist term for people who wear clothes all
the time in the ``textile world,'' are aliens at White Thorn Lodge.
   ``Most people seek the breeze, the sun, the rain and the freedom
of wearing no pantyhose,'' said Lynn Arnett, 44, a free-lance
writer from Paradise Lakes, Fla. ``You tell the first lie of the
day when you put your clothes on.''
   About 1,000 nudists are expected to show up over the weekend at
White Thorn Lodge, a pleasant campground on the Ohio-Pennsylvania
border about 40 miles west of Pittsburgh, according to lodge
secretary K. Mathesius.
   Convention security was tight Thursday. Clothed and nude men
guarded the gate. Reporters who shed only their ties were escorted
among friendly families sharing lunch at picnic tables, smiling
couples sitting on shaded lawn chairs, and naked children running
across the grass.
   ``It's the freedom. It's the comfort. Our society equates nudity
with sexuality, but this is a totally non-sexual setting. People
are just people here,'' said Mary Lou Schloss, 40, of Rochester,
N.Y., a nudism activist who brought her husband and children to the
convention.
   ``I just like the swimming pool, the hot tub and the food,''
said her son, Evan, 8, a third-grader who wore only cherry soda on
his face.
   The association's membership comprises 55 percent of the
30,000-member American Sunbathing Association, which helps
publicize nudism and rates nudist colonies.
   Nudists come in all ages, sizes and shapes, including smooth,
wrinkled and scarred. Some live in cabins, recreational vehicles
and tents on the grounds.
   On Thursday, all sat on towels and wore convention credentials
on chains around their necks. With temperatures in the high 80s,
some wore only sneakers and some only T-shirts. Since no one has
pockets, the snack bar runs a tab for hamburgers and soft drinks.
   Officials said only about 10 percent of card-carrying nudists
are unmarried. Women are always wanted.
   ``There's a problem getting women here, but then why don't many
women go into bars by themselves?'' Ms. Arnett said. ``When they
find out what it's all about, they say, `Why did it take me so
long?' ''
   Stokes said ``pockets of intolerance'' have limited nudism to
homes or to the ``social or recreational'' campgrounds, health
clubs and remote beaches.
   But, he said, surveys among nudists show only about 15 percent
disrobe to get an all-over tan.
   ``We wear sunscreen when it's appropriate. We're very aware of
our bodies,'' Stokes said.
   ``When it's cold, we put clothes on,'' said Mrs. Schloss.
``We're not fanatics.''

   Palestinian killed by army; no pickup

   Palestinians in the occupied territories
blocked streets and stayed away from work today to show support for
women jailed for their roles in the Palestinian uprising.
   Also, state-run radio said a Palestinian who died in Gaza City
Thursday was killed by Israeli troops as he prepared to throw a
firebomb. The death touched off demonstrations in which two
Palestinians were wounded by gunfire and two Israeli riot police
were injured by stones.
   Palestinians throughout the occupied lands went on strike today.
Outlawed Palestinian flags waved on utility poles from Bethlehem to
Nablus in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Graffiti appeared on walls overnight reading ``Death to the
Zionists'' and ``Yes for a Palestinian state.''
   Before dawn, Palestinian protesters blocked some streets with
rocks, barrels and burning tires, an apparent effort to prevent
Palestinians from breaking the strike organized by the underground
leadership of the uprising that began Dec. 8.
   The strike, called to protest the jailing of Palestinian women,
halted transportation and shut down shops.
   The Palestinian-run Jerusalem Media and Communication Center
said 30 Palestinian women are being held in Israeli jails, most on
suspicion of inciting violence against Israel.
   An Israeli army spokesman said the army was checking the report
on Israel's state-run radio that troops fatally shot 37-year-old
Hadel Hafez el Toruk in Gaza City.
   He died in Ahali Hospital of wounds sustained on July 22,
hospital officials said. The army confirmed the death and said it
was investigating the circumstances.
   Toruk's family told the army he was shot at the same time
soldiers opened fire at Palestinians who threw a Molotov cocktail
at them. Toruk said before he died that he did not see his
assailants, a hospital official said.
   ``He said he was walking in the street, and then he fell down,
and he didn't know what happened,'' said the hospital official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The fatality brought to 235 the number of Palestinians killed in
the anti-Israeli revolt. Four Israelis also have died.
   Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he reacted
positively to reports that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Murphy planned to meet with Palestinian representatives.
   Peres said he was against meetings with members of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which is banned in Israel, but did not
necessarily oppose meetings with PLO supporters.
   ``We make a distinction between people who are members of the
PLO, which is an organization that deals in terrorism and has a
charter that calls for the destruction of Israel,'' Peres said on
Israeli television.
   Murphy is to leave next week for a peace mission that will take
him to Israel, Jordan, Syria, and Egypt.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said
Thursday she was unaware of plans for Murphy to talk to Palestinian
leaders. She also said U.S. policy of refusing to meet PLO leaders
remained in place.
   Peres previously has called for negotiations between Israel and
a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   But on Thursday, Jordan said it was changing its policy toward
the 1.5 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories to
give the PLO more responsibility there and avoid friction between
Jordan and the PLO.
   Toward this end, Jordan announced it was halting a $1.3 billion,
5-year development project in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. The plan was set up in 1986 by agreement with the PLO.

<TEXT>
   Hot-tempered actor Sean Penn won't face criminal
mischief charges, but he says he'll pay for repairs to a news
photographer's car that he kicked.
   The 27-year-old actor was accused of giving the boot to the
driver's side door of New York Post photographer Paul Adao's car on
July 3. Adao said Penn attacked him as he sat in the driver's seat
photographing the actor and his wife, the singer Madonna, as they
left a cafe.
   Penn later said the photographer's car almost ran over him and
he kicked it in self-defense. However, Adao denied he was moving or
anywhere near Penn when the actor kicked his car.
   During a five-minute hearing Thursday in Manhattan Criminal
Court both sides agreed to drop the matter, and Penn said he would
pay damages.
   Adao said it would cost Penn about $800 to fix the car door. He
said Penn would also pay the cost of renting a car while Adao's
auto is being repaired.

   A businessman who offered on television to
``adopt'' a welfare family is actually heavily in debt, faces a
charge of bank fraud and, according to one creditor, ``is the
biggest deadbeat I have ever worked with.''
   Boca Raton businessman James N. Gisclair was slapped with the
federal charge two weeks before he made national headlines and went
on NBC-TV's ``Today Show'' Thursday with his philanthropic
intentions.
   Gisclair planned to ``adopt'' Anita Hunter and her family and
give them a new house, a new car and a new life away fom the
drug-ridden Miami neighborhood called ``The Hole.'' He said he
hoped they would, in time, become self-sufficient.
   ``The only person it's not humorous for is that poor lady who's
not going to get anything,'' said Hugh Culverhouse Jr., an attorney
for Capital Bank, which has been unable to collect a $1.4 million
judgement against Gisclair.
   The generous offer also came as a surprise to Kent Ewing, whose
Boynton Beach landscaping firm is owed $24,750 by Gisclair.
   ``He says he's going to help the poor and he can't even pay his
bills,'' Ewing said. ``This is an affront to the civilization that
I am a part of. He is the biggest deadbeat I have ever worked
with.''
   In a lawsuit, Capital Bank alleges that Gisclair defrauded them
by securing loans with money he did not have, said Tim Ross, the
company's attorney. He later swore his six businesses were
worthless, court records show.
   The criminal charges stem from the civil case, according to
Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie, who filed a
complaint against Gisclair in a Miami federal court accusing him of
making a false statement to a bank.
   Gisclair could face up to three years in jail if he's convicted
on the criminal charges.
   Telephone calls to Gisclair's office by The Associated Press on
Thursday were not returned. Anita Hunter does not own a phone and
could not be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
   A five-man U.N. team arrived in the
Iranian capital of Tehran today to investigate the downing an
Iranian jetliner by a U.S. warship. American experts wrapped up
their probe in the Persian Gulf.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization team planned to
start its probe at Tehran international airport, where part of
Iran's air traffic control network is based, said Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The group from the Montreal-based U.N. agency planned to travel
to Bandar Abbas airport in southern Iran, from which the Iran Air
Airbus took off on a brief scheduled flight to Dubai on July 5.
   Iran says all 290 aboard were killed after the plane was hit by
missiles from the cruiser USS Vincennes. Pentagon officials said
officers of the Vincennes mistook the Airbus A300 for an Iranian
F-14 jet fighter on an attack course.
   The ICAO experts also will go to the area where the plane
crashed into the sea near the Iranian island of Hengham in the
Strait of Hormuz, the Iranian agency said in a dispatch monitored
in Cyprus.
   The experts will stay in Iran for a week, the news agency said.
The team is in Iran at the request of the Iranian government to
help resolve discrepancies in accounts given by the two sides.
   The U.S. team left the gulf Thursday after spending 3{ weeks in
the region, Navy officials said. The team led by Rear Adm. William
M. Fogarty arrived July 5, two days after the disaster.
   Fogarty's team worked in secret and made no statements before
leaving. U.S. Navy officials said a report will not be released
before mid-August.
   Investigators compiled data from computer tapes on the Vincennes
and two other U.S. warships that were in the area, the frigate USS
Elmer Montgomery and missile frigate John H. Sides.
   They also took sworn testimony from the commander of the
Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, and other officers of the
three warships.
   Iran asked the 33-nation governing council of the International
Civil Aviation Organization to meet in special session to condemn
the attack, but members refused to censure the United States.
   U.S. delegate Edmund Stohr said the United States will offer the
U.N. investigating team whatever help it can. He said the team had
not asked to board the Vincennes, and he didn't know if such a
visit would be possible considering the military situation in the
gulf.
   ICAO is a technical body composed of 159 nations. It sets
standards for civil aviation and airline safety.

<HEAD>Two Men Extradited From Burma And Sentenced To Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men who fled to Burma after killing two
people during a failed bank heist were returned to China and
sentenced to death, an official newspaper reported today.
   The People's Daily saod Burma extradited Li Danian and Wang
Yueping to China in February after they sneaked across the border.
   The paper said Li, Wang and another accomplice were running a
business in Hunan province that went into debt. To pay back the
debt they decided to start robbing banks.
   It said the trio began robbing banks in June 1987, striking
among others the Agricultural Bank and the Industrial and
Commercial Bank in the Hunan city of Yueyang. The paper said they
failed to steal any money.
   On July 7, 1987, the paper said, the trio broke into another
Yueyang bank and killed a bank guard and a clerk. Still, no money
was stolen, it said.
   Li and Wang then fled to Burma. Their accomplice, Yi Maohua,
stayed behind and was captured.
   The paper said the three were sentenced on Monday and would be
executed soon. China executes people with a bullet to the back of
the head.
   Chinese papers have been devoting more space to reports on crime
in recent years. In almost every case, when they report on bank
heists, the papers say the robberies end in failure.
   The apparent reason for this is that the state-run press doesn't
want to encourage copycat crimes.

   A defense lawyer says the Mexicans charged in
the barbaric killing of a U.S. drug agent are innocent victims, and
he has evidence of a huge coverup designed to protect the highest
Mexican officials.
   The three men charged in the kidnapping and murder of Enrique
Camarena, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, are victims of
Mexico's corrupt judicial system, defense attorney Barry Tarlow
said in opening arguments Thursday.
   ``People destroyed, altered and failed to preserve evidence,''
Tarlow told the jury. ``When you see the widespread corruption, it
becomes impossible to see who is reliable.''
   The prosecutor in the case said that Camarena died in a torture
chamber at the hands of people trying to elicit information about a
U.S. drug investigation.
   ``Special agent Camarena's skull was fractured in numerous
places, in the front of the head and in the back of the head. It
resembled, basically, a cracked eggshell,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jimmy Gurule.
   ``At the top of the skull, the skull had actually been
penetrated by a blunt instrument, that an object had been driven
through the skull,'' he said.
   Tarlow, however, contends the people responsible for Camarena's
slaying are in a safe haven in Mexico.
   The sensitivity of the grisly case was evident at the entrance
of U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie's courtroom, where U.S.
marshals had set up a metal detector, in addition to security
checks made at the courthouse entrances.
   The trial is expected to take about 10 weeks.
   The bodies of Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar,
were found buried at a remote ranch in Mexico several weeks after
they were abducted separately in Guadalajara on Feb. 7, 1985.
   On trial are Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, and Raul Lopez Alvarez,
28, who are charged with murdering Camarena and Zavala; and Jesus
Felix Gutierrez, 38, who is charged with being an accessory.
   They were among nine people indicted in the case by a federal
grand jury in Los Angeles earlier this year. Four are in custody in
Mexico, one was killed by Mexican police and one is at large.
   Camarena was kidnapped in 1985 as he left the U.S. consulate in
Guadalajara after he and other agents uncovered a drug trafficking
operation said to have been run by reputed Mexican drug lord Rafael
Caro Quintero.
   Caro also is charged in the killings and is in custody in Mexico.
   The prosecution alleges Camarena was tortured in an effort to
make him provide information about the U.S. investigation into
Caro's activities.

<TEXT>
   It began as a spur-of-the-moment
spoof, a lighthearted jab at Chattanooga's upper crust and their
yearly social gala, the Cotton Ball.
   But the Kudzu Ball, showing a tenacity its leafy little namesake
would be proud of, has slowly become an annual event in its own
right in this Tennessee river town.
   ``People just like to get out and have a good time,'' L.R.
``Tex'' Greenwood, one of the ball's founders, said Thursday.
``It's inexpensive, it's for a good cause. And it gives people a
chance to act like a bunch of kids. It's just fun.''
   The seventh annual Kudzu Ball, complete with its own king and
queen, bluegrass bands and a best-costume contest, is set for
tonight at the Town and Country Shopping Center in North
Chattanooga.
   Well, not exactly the shopping center itself _ the parking lot
outside JB & Friends, a night spot where the idea was hatched for a
kooky celebration of the South's most famous weed.
   ``A group of pseudo-intellectuals was sitting there one night,
and we decided that to quaff 'em once or twice a week, we needed a
purpose,'' said Greenwood.
   ``Somebody said, `Let's have a ball.' And one of us looked out
the window, and there was kudzu all over this hill next to the bar,
and someone said, `How about a kudzu ball?'''
   Kudzu, as any Southerner worth his grits knows, is the Oriental
vine introduced to Dixie 50 years ago to stop soil erosion. The
problem was that the pesky little weed didn't know when to stop.
   It's been known to grow a foot overnight and has proven
impervious to most efforts to kill it. Today, the creeping, choking
vine blankets seven million acres in 12 southeastern states, not to
mention telephone poles, cars, houses and lazy dogs who snooze in
one place too long.
   All of which made it the perfect inspiration for an offbeat ball
that's always been held the same night as the more socially polite
Cotton Ball, itself named for the South's other famous plant.
   Greenwood admits the organizing group, known as the
Long-Range-Way-Down-the-Road-and-Out-of-Sight Planning Commission,
may have had an assist from the Swine Ball, Nashville's takeoff on
its own Swan Ball.
   But the Kudzu Ball has taken on an identity of its own, drawing
5,000 to 7,000 people a year into the cozy little parking lot, many
of them festooned with snips of the wily weed.
   ``They like to be like the kudzu itself _ all cluttered up and
close together, like a bunch of sheep,'' Greenwood said.
   Tickets are $5 each _ the event has raised about $43,000 for the
Chattanooga Birth Defects Center over the years _ but organizers
say some of the costumes alone are worth that price.
   You might see a green-tinted dog with a sign reading ``Kudzu
MacKenzie,'' or a rugged, bandoleer-and-kudzu-draped commando
calling himself Kudzo.
   Greenwood routinely shows up as a bandanaed balladeer named
Kudzu Willie, and this year's ball promises a debate between
Michael Dukudzu and Gorge Bush.
   There's plenty of bluegrass music, vendors have been known to
sell a beer or two, and the festivities general wind up with the
selection of a king and queen from a 12-member court.
   It took awhile for the Cotton Ball organizers to get used to the
parody celebration. But now, said Greenwood, they've apparently
accepted it, since some of the debutantes usually show up at the
Kudzu Ball after their event is over.
   ``Now, we have never been invited to theirs. And I don't think
we're going to,'' Greenwood said, chuckling. ``Which I don't blame
'em. I wouldn't ask me in, either.''

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Spurts But Greenspan Calms Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says consumer spending increased at the fastest
pace in 10 months during June, but Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan has renewed a pledge to keep a tight rein on credit
to control inflation.
   The Commerce Department on Thursday said personal consumption
spending, which includes virtually everything except interest on
debt, shot up a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent in June, the
steepest climb since a 1.3 percent gain last August.
   The report was disappointing to many economists who were
expecting growth in consumer demand to slow in order to narrow the
nation's trade deficit.
   In another economic report, the Labor Department said import
prices, one of the main inflationary threats facing the U.S.
economy because of the weaker dollar, rose 2.7 percent in the
April-June quarter, the biggest increase in more than a year.
   The climb followed a 1.2 percent increase in the January-March
period and was the steepest since the 4.1 percent jump in the first
three months of 1987.
   Greenspan, in an appearance before a House Banking subcommittee,
said the 4.7-percent inflation figure released Wednesday as part of
a report on the second-quarter gross national product was
``somewhat larger than we would have expected.''
   But he said recent economic indicators have shown no evidence
that would cause the Federal Reserve to radically change its
monetary policy. Greenspan has indicated before that the Fed would
move to tighten credit if necessary to curb higher inflation.
   In the financial markets, bond prices _ usually most sensitive
to news of inflation _ fell slightly and interest rates rose. The
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late in the day at
9.25 percent, up from 9.23 percent late Wednesday.
   Stock prices rose modestly. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 28.63 to close at 2,082.33, erasing Wednesday's
20-point drop.
   Also Thursday, the administration projected the federal deficit
for the upcoming budget year at $140.1 billion _ short of the
trigger for across-the-board spending cuts. But officials warned
that a hefty drought-relief bill could cause the automatic
reductions to kick in.

   Terry Kinney, assistant chief of bureau for The
Associated Press in Columbus, Ohio, has been named AP's chief of
bureau in Charleston, W. Va.
   AP President Louis D. Boccardi announced the appointment
Thursday.
   Kinney, 42, has held the Columbus post since 1983 and previously
was correspondent in charge of AP's Cincinnati bureau. He joined AP
in Des Moines in 1973 and transferred to Cincinnati in 1979,
becoming correspondent there the following year.

<HEAD>Researchers Close To Identifying Gene Defect In Fatal Disorder</HEAD>

   Researchers are close to identifying
the gene responsible for an inherited disorder in which a simple
inability to break down and dispose of certain fats can kill
seemingly healthy boys.
   As the researchers close in on the gene, they are testing a
specially formulated diet that may prevent the appearance of the
disease in boys and men who have inherited the genetic defect, said
the leader of the research team, Dr. Hugo Moser of Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.
   The discovery of the gene may allow researchers to insert normal
cells into the victims' bodies to cure the disorder, in which
apparently healthy boys suddenly lose mental faculties, got into a
coma and die.
   Moser said Thursday at a genetics meeting at the Jackson
Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, that the disease, which occurs in
perhaps one in 10,000 or one in 20,000 people, has a devastating
effect on families.
   In its most severe form, it usually strikes boys 4 to 8 years
old, Moser said. They deteriorate to a vegetative state within a
year, and they remain in that state for up to 10 years before
dying, he said.
   ``You can imagine what that does to the family,'' he said.
   Before the disease appears, the boys have no signs of illness,
he said.
   One boy lost the ability to distinguish speech early in the
disease and could understand his mother only by reading her lips.
Shortly after Moser determined this, he got a call saying the boy
had lost his vision _ and with it the ability to communicate with
his mother.
   ``Somehow the devastation of a normal child is even harder to
take than a child that is born impaired,'' Moser said.
   The disease, called adrenoleukodystrophy, is caused by the lack
of an enzyme that helps the body break down and dispose of certain
fats.
   In people with the disorder, the abnormal build-up of these
fats, which are called long-chain fatty acids, damages the adrenal
gland, causing hormonal problems, and the insulation surrounding
nerve cells, causing brain damage.
   For reasons that scientists do not understand, some victims of
the disease experience only mild problems in adulthood and others
have no symptoms whatsoever.
   Moser estimated that 50 percent have the severe childhood form,
30 percent the milder adult form, 10 percent only hormonal
imbalances and 10 percent no symptoms at all.
   The genetic defect that causes it can be identified in the fetus
before birth, giving parents the option to terminate the pregnancy,
Moser said.
   Moser told of one family of an aolescent boy who is a champion
athlete and who carries the genetic defect but has no signs of
disease. His parents have decided not to tell him that he has the
disease, Moser said.
   Moser and his colleagues have now devised a low-fat diet that
helps prevent the build-up of fats in these children.
   They are testing the diet now, and do not yet know whether
preventing the fat build-up in these patients will indeed prevent
the disease, Moser said.
   Bone marrow transplants have also been used in four cases to try
to prevent the disease, he said, but bone marrow transplants pose a
tricky ethical question, he said.
   As many as 20 percent ot 30 percent of people who get bone
marrow transplants die as a result of the transplants. Yet half of
the victims of adrenoleukodystrophy do not get the severe childhood
disease, so it may be unwise to recommend such a dangerous
procedure for them, Moser said.
   Scientists do not yet know how to predict which people with the
defect will be severely affected and which will be only mildly
affected, but they are working diligently to determine that, Moser
said.

   A cat that apparently preferred France to
West Germany walked 620 miles to its old home here, the feline's
former owner says.
   Madeline Martinet said her cat, Gribouille, appeared on her
doorstep in this central French city this week, nearly two years
after he was reported missing from Reutlingen, a West German town
near Stuttgart.
   Gribouille was 2 months old when Mrs. Martinet gave him away in
July 1986 to her neighbor, who later moved to Reutlingen. The
former neighbor told Mrs. Martinet that the cat disappeared in
October 1986.
   ``My son and daughter-in-law found him sick and sleeping in
front of my front door'' on Sunday night, Mrs. Martinet said. ``My
son said, `Why, it's Gribouille.' Then the cat lifted its head and
cried.''
   A veterinarian said the cat had an eye infection, and prescribed
antibiotics. Despite the infection and malnutrition, the cat seems
to be recovering, Mrs. Martinet said.
   ``He has the same spots and a particular mew that he mews when I
speak to him,'' she said. ``It's definitely little Gribouille.''
   She said she told her former neighbor on Thursday that
Gribouille had been found.
   ``But this time, we are going to keep him,'' said Mrs. Martinet.
``I don't think he liked Germany.''

   Paint, pennants and props that were part
of the pomp of the 1984 Olympic Games now form the backdrop for
motorcycle races, courtesy of Summer Games buff Chris Agajanian.
   ``I love that Olympics stuff,'' said Agajanian, who owns Ascot
Park raceway in this Los Angeles suburb _ and $300,000 worth of
Olympics goods.
   There's bunting everywhere, shining in the still familiar
``clean aqua,'' ``hot magenta'' and ``rich chrome yellow'' hues
said by the planners of the 1984 Games to represent the Southern
California spirit.
   Brightly colored pennants hang on the walls between billboards
promoting spark plugs, chewing tobacco and bail bond agencies.
   The faded, scratched victory stands, which still have the
Olympic rings and star symbols visible, are planted in the race
track infield amid plastic pink flamingoes.
   Agajanian said that when he heard that a lot of the Olympic
furnishings were being auctioned, he started bidding.
   ``I ended up buying 5,000 seats from the swim stadium and some
of the ticket booths,'' he said recently. ``I got some tents. Some
flags. Some bunting. Some fencing. Some bullhorns.
   ``And I bought hundreds of gallons of Olympics paint. Used it
all over.''
   Agajanian has a collection of Olympic programs, ticket stubs,
parking passes, souvenir medallions and the like in a drawer in his
office.
   ``I've got more stuff in a warehouse,'' Agajanian said.
``Shirts. Uniforms. Even some of those blazers.
   ``But those colors? I'd never wear one of 'em.''

<HEAD>Former Principal Dancer With American Ballet Theatre Dies of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Carter, a choreographer and former
leading dancer with the American Ballet Theater, died of AIDS at
Mt. Sinai Hospital. He was 56.
   Carter, who died Thursday, also performed as a principal with
the New York City Ballet, as a modern dancer with the Martha Graham
Dance Company and with Pearl Lang, and as a Spanish dancer with
Maria Alba.
   He was described by critics as an eloquent, eminently serious
artist who could bring distinction to the most lifeless roles.
   Carter began to study dance at age 12 to try to strengthen his
legs, which had been weakened by polio. He moved to New York in
1957, joining Ballet Theater that year.
   Carter choreographed for many companies in the United States and
abroad, including the Milwaukee Ballet and the Athens Opera and
Athens Opera Ballet. He created the ballet for the 1975 film ``In
the Rehearsal Room,'' starring Cynthia Gregory and Ivan Nagy.
   In 1986, he was named acting artistic director of the Rome Opera
Ballet.

<HEAD>Four Killed As Violence Erupts On Peace Pact Anniversary</HEAD>

   Three Sinhalese extremists and a
soldier were killed and militants torched buses on the first
anniversary of an accord aimed at ending Tamil separatist violence,
police said today.
   Most shops, offices and businesses were closed today in Colombo,
the capital, and its surburbs. Police said people were afraid to
open their businesses because of possible violence by Sinhalese
radicals opposed to the Indian-brokered peace accord.
   A 24-hour curfew went into effect at 6 a.m. today in the
island's south after radical Sinhalese nationalists called for a
general strike.
   Residents in the northern city of Vavuniya, about 125 miles
northeast of Colombo, said by telephone that Indian soldiers also
declared curfews in some areas in the island's north and east until
Sunday morning to prevent attacks by Tamil rebels.
   The peace accord is opposed both by Tamil rebels fighting for
five years for independence in the north and east of the island and
by the Peoples Liberation Front, an extremist group from the
island's majority Sinhalese community.
   The Sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority,
while the Tamils say it does not meet their demands for
independence.
   Three men were killed by police in separate incidents in which
Sinhalese extremists tried to attack government property, a police
spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said a Sinhalese Sri
Lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with extremists in
Hambantota district in the south.
   In southern and central Sri Lanka, strongholds of the Sinhalese
extremists, at least eight government-owned buses were set afire
Thursday night and this morning, the police spokesman said.
   Electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern Sri
Lanka were cut Thursday night after Sinhalese extremists bew up
electrical transformers, he said.
   A railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a
firebomb as it pulled into Colombo, police said. Only a few
government-owned or private buses were seen running.
   In the island's north, nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers deployed
under the peace accord were put on alert after Tamil rebels called
for a demonstration to protest the peace pact.
   On Thursday, 14 Sinhalese farmers were killed by Tamil rebels
near Padaviya village, about 100 miles northeast of Colombo.
   The peace accord, signed by India and Sri Lanka on July 29,
1987, calls for the government to grant limited autonomy to
minority Tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight
for a separate Tamil nation.
   India agreed help disarm the Tamil rebels. But violence has
persisted in the Tamil areas of the north and east because the main
Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, refused to
accept the accord.
   India is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its
own Tamil minority of 60 million for the island conflict. Before
the peace pact was signed, Sri Lanka regularly accused India of
training and supplying the rebels.
   More than 8,000 people have been killed since the ethnic war
began in 1983. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million people and say they are discriminated
against by the Sinhalese. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up about 75
percent and control the government and the army.
   More than 400 people have been killed since the accord was
signed in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists.
   Most of the victims have been government officials or members of
the governing United National Party of President Junius R.
Jayewardene, who signed the accord.

<HEAD>Palestinians Divided On Impact Of Jordanian Aid Cancellation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli officials today said Jordan's decision
to cancel a $1.3 billion development plan for the Israeli-occupied
territories would have no practical effect because the plan existed
primarily on paper.
   Palestinian leaders in the West Bank were divided on the impact.
Some said it would seriously hurt some residents already struggling
financially because of the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied lands.
   Jordan announced Thursday it was canceling the development
program in a move to hand over more responsibility for the 1.5
million Arabs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli expert on the West Bank, said he
thought the move was the first step toward a decision by Jordan's
King Hussein eventually to cut ties with the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip altogether.
   ``He wants to see how people react. But ultimately he has no
choice but to cut ties,'' Benvenisti, head of the West Bank Data
Bank, a U.S.-funded research project, said in an interview.
   ``If he doesn't, he gives money to people who in the long run
are his enemies,'' said Benvenisti, referring to a growing
anti-Jordanian slant among West Bank Palestinians.
   He said Hussein's plan ``was a bubble. King Hussein didn't have
the money for the project. He hoped to get foreign governments to
donate funds.''
   It is difficult to gauge how much of the $1.3 billion has
reached the occupied territories. Deposed Gaza City Mayor Rashad
Shawaa said the Gaza Strip had received about $6.6 million.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the Jordanian measure would
not affect his approach to a Middle East peace settlement based on
Israeli-Jordanian negotiations.
   Hussein and Peres, of the left-leaning Labor Party, agreed last
year to hold direct talks in the framework of an international
peace conference. The accord was vetoed by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud Bloc.
   Peres, speaking on Israel radio, said Jordan remained crucial to
a resolution of the Palestinian problem because the 850,000 West
Bank Palestinians hold Jordanian passports, the West Bank and
Jordan have strong trade links, and Israel and Jordan share a long
border.
   In Gaza City, Shawaa, known for his pro-Jordanian views, said in
an interview that the move was ``regrettable because people here
need help, and this was an important source of help.''
   But Mustafa Natsche, deposed mayor of the West Bank city of
Hebron and a PLO supporter, said ``the Amman decision will not
affect anybody.''
   Natsche said the Palestinians in the West Bank needed
contributions from all the Arab countries, not just Jordan. But he
said what they needed most was to be steadfast in their struggle to
end Israeli occupation.
   The five-year project was set up by Jordan in 1986 under an
agreement with Yasser Arafat's PLO. It was to improve health,
education, housing, cultural and other services in the territories.
   Israel took the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Two-thirds of Jordan's 3.5
million people are of Palestinian origin.

<HEAD>North Korean Parliament Proposes U.S. Talks On '53 Armistice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea today said it proposed a conference
with U.S. lawmakers so the nations can discuss a peace accord that
would replace the 1953 armistice ending the Korean War.
   Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said the
proposal was made by Chairman Yang Hyong Sop of the Supreme
People's Assembly in a letter sent to the leaders of the U.S. House
and Senate.
   It said Yang proposed that the talks be held at the earliest
possible date in Pyongyang, New York or any third country between
the two delegations, each comprising seven to nine legislators.
   ``It would be good to discuss measures for cooperation between
the two parliaments in replacing the Korean armistice agreement
with a peace agreement,'' it quoted Yang's letter as saying.
   The armistice was signed by North Korea and China on one side
and the United Nations Command, led by the United States, on the
other. It ended the bloody Korean War, which began in 1950 when
North Korea invaded the south in an attempt to unify the Korean
peninsula by force.
   Protesters in South Korea have demanded that the United States
sign a peace treaty that would replace the armistice agreement. The
two Koreas are technically still at war, since no treaty has been
signed.
   Last week, North Korea sent a proposal to South Korea calling
for joint sessions between their legislatures to draw up a
non-aggression pact to end the enmity and rivalry that have
prevailed since the peninsula was divided at the end of World War
II.
   The South Korean National Assembly said it was ready to accept
the North Korean call for talks on the non-aggression pact and the
North's possible participation in the Olympic Games in Seoul in
September.
   The latest North Korean peace offer to the United States was the
first in four years. In 1984, Pyongyang proposed a tripartite
conference among the two Koreas and the United States to seek a
permanent peace and an eventual reunification of the Korean
peninsula.
   The 1984 proposal was rejected by both South Korea and the
United States on grounds that peace and unification were matters to
be settled between the two Koreas.
   After the 1984 proposal, President Reagan, at a state dinner
honoring Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang in Washington, told reporters,
``It would be just wonderful if there would be a four-way
conference with China and both Koreas and the United States.''
   The latest proposal was made in cordial, diplomatic language
free from the North's usual vitriolic hyperbole.
   ``The best way we and the United States can choose at present is
to have peace negotiation to slacken the whetting swords and firing
guns against each other or cease them completely,'' Yang's letter
said.
   Yang said he made the proposal ``recognizing that we and the
United States, directly responsible parties for easing tension and
providing peace in Korea, must sit at the table as soon as
possible.''

<HEAD>Government Rejects Peace Talks With Leftist Guerrillas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco said his
government would not participate in church-sponsored peace talks
today with leftist guerrillas and that any insurgents who come to
the table will be jailed.
   Barco's decision Thursday dashed hopes for a quick settlement to
a guerrilla war that killed 75,000 people in 25 years. Barco acted
after military leaders criticized the proposed talks.
   But Barco, in a communique, said his government planned to study
recommendations by the conference. The meeting was to include
church leaders, former presidents, 20 congressmen and a former
presidential candidate who was kidnapped and later freed by the
guerrillas.
   The leader of the April 19 Movement, Carlos Pizarro Leongomez,
planned to send a tape-recorded message to the gathering, a Pizarro
spokesman, Carlos Ramiro Lucio Escobar, said at a news conference
Thursday.
   The spokesman said the government decision not to participate
could be a mistake. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 guerrillas
operate in Colombia.
   The guerrilla group, also known as M-19, demanded peace talks as
a condition for the release earlier this month of the former
presidential candidate it kidnapped.
   The government refused to meet the demand for the release of
Alvaro Gomez Hurtado, who was abducted May 29 in a hail of
submachine-gun fire in Bogota.
   The guerrilla group released Gomez anyway and the government
said it would think about negotating with the insurgents.
   Church leaders and members of the country's two leading
political groups, the Conservative and Liberal parties, met in
Panama with M-19 guerrillas to win Gomez's release.
   Those who met with the guerrillas said that regardless of the
government's decision they would organize a peace conference in
Bogota after Gomez was freed. Gomez, the son of former President
Laureano Gomez, said he would attend.
   The M-19 also took over the Palace of Justice Nov. 7, 1985 in an
attack that left 115 dead, including 11 Supreme Court justices.
   Bishop Dario Castrillon Hoyos has been the driving force behind
organizing the peace conference.
   After meeting Thursday with Barco at the presidential palace, he
revealed the government's refusal to attend the peace conference
and said he could understand the difficult position Barco is in.
   Castrillon did not elaborate, but he undoubtedly was referring
to the military's opposition to peace talks. ``The nation wants to
stop the war,'' the bishop said. ``It has to be stopped.''
   The country's two most powerful generals, the minister of
defense, Rafael Samudio, and the head of the chiefs of staff, Jaime
Guerrero, have said they oppose any peace talks with the rebels.
   But the two generals, in an apparent attempt to calm fears of a
military coup attempt, also said they would abide by any government
decision to negotiate with the insurgents.
   Barco's communique said his government might offer pardons to
guerrillas for political crimes. But even that position left little
hope of any reconciliation between the government and the
guerrillas.
   Political crimes, by the government's definition, do not include
the majority of guerrilla activities _ kidnappings, ambushes on
army patrols and bloody raids on dozens of towns in the last 25
years.

   Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels said they
pulled out of two towns in western Iran today after killing or
wounding 40,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards during three days of
fighting.
   But Iran said its forces drove the rebels out of the Iranian
towns of Eslamabad and Karand, killing or wounding at least 1,000
enemy troops in a battle with the ``forces of the Baghdad regime
and their hypocritical mercenaries.''
   At the United Nations on Thursday, representatives for both gulf
war foes accused each other of blocking U.N. efforts to end the
nearly 8-year-old war.
   Tehran radio interrupted its normal programs to play martial
music and announce victory over the rebels, members of the National
Liberation Army of Iran.
   In a later announcement, the radio said Iranian forces were
advancing in a bid to liberate the Iraqi-occupied Iranian towns of
Sar-e Pol-e Zahab and Gilan-e Gharb.
   The National Liberation Army rebels operate a series of bases or
camps along the border, usually just on the Iraqi side of the
frontier.
   The rebel group said in a communique released in Baghdad that
its guerrillas penetrated 95 miles into Iran and controlled Karand
and Eslamabad near the central border for 72 hours.
   It said that during the fighting, two Iranian F-4 jet fighters
and two Cobra helicopter gunships were shot down, and hundreds of
tanks and armored personnel carriers were destroyed.
   The claims by the rebel group could not be independently
confirmed. Reporters are allowed into battle areas only during rare
guided tours.
   Earlier, Iran said its forces broke through the defenses of the
Iraqis and the National Liberation Army at Eslamabad.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus, said Thursday that Iranian forces killed at least
4,000 Iraqis and ``mercenaries'' in the battle.
   A communique issued Thursday by Iraq's military said its
warplanes were bombing Iranian military airfields around Eslamabad.
   Iraq demands a face-to-face meeting with Iran before a
cease-fire, and Iran insists on a truce before it will consider a
direct talks.
   Pressure was increasing on Iraq in the 15-member U.N. Security
Council to drop its direct talks demand and other proposals that
could prolong the fighting, according to U.N. diplomats, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The foreign ministers of both countries have met separately in
New York with U.N. secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The talks were made possible on when Iran, which has suffered a
series of battlefield setbacks in recent months, on July 18
accepted a year-old United Nations resolution calling for a
cease-fire in the war. Iraq accepted the resolution shortly after
it was passed.

<TEXT>
   As sand trickled through an hourglass on
Johnny Carson's desk, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton humorously sought
to deflate the windbag image he gained from a much-reviled speech
at the Democratic National Convention.
   Clinton, who has been called a windbag in Carson's jokes about
the speech, traded quips with the ``Tonight Show'' host Thursday
before jamming on saxophone with the show's band.
   And he told Carson that, contrary to some opinions, his
over-long introduction of the Democrats' presidential nominee,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, was a stunning success.
   ``My sole goal was achieved,'' he said. ``I wanted so badly to
make Dukakis look great, and I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams,''
   Clinton, who had been given 15 minutes to introduce the
governor, talked for more than twice that long.
   He said of Dukakis, ``He called me a few days ago and he said he
thought the speech was great, everything was forgiven and would I
please nominate George Bush in New Orleans,'' Clinton said to
applause and laughter from the show's studio audience.
   Carson told the audience during his show's opening monologue
that Clinton was to be a guest, and added: ``Not to worry, we have
plenty of black coffee and extra cots in the lobby.''
   He later introduced Clinton with a satirical, long-winded speech
of his own that included details ranging from the governor's
educational background to the first name of New Jersey's Democratic
Sen. Bill Bradley.
   After Clinton sat on the couch, Carson said, ``My first question
is, How are you?'' Carson then turned over the hourglass.
   Later, saying he'd already proved he could mess up with his
voice, the governor said he'd see if he could ``mess up with a
song'' and impressed the crowd with his performance on tenor
saxophone.
   Clinton said the speech was unintentionally drawn out but was
meant to introduce Dukakis to millions of Americans who weren't
familiar with his accomplishments.
   Asked about his own ambitions for higher office, the governor
said, ``Depends on how I do on the show tonight.''

<HEAD>Discovery's Test-Firing Postponed Again</HEAD>

   NASA today postponed the crucial
launch pad test-firing of Discovery's three main engines another
three days when an attempt to fuel the space shuttle ran into
problems with equipment not used since the Challenger disaster.
   The postponement from Monday to Thursday was the third delay of
the test in a week, and could put off the first post-Challenger
shuttle flight _ already delayed until late September _ until
October, officials said.
   Preparations for loading 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and
liquid oxygen into Discovery's fuel tank began Thursday night, but
the launch team quickly had trouble with sensors and an oxygen pump.
   Technicians resolved those problems but a leak in a hydrogen
line and another balky oxygen pump finally forced a postponement
early today.
   The test will be postponed a minimum of 72 hours, with the
launch team hoping to resume the first phase of the countdown
Sunday night for the test-firing at 7:30 a.m. Thursday, said NASA
spokesman George Diller.
   It was the first time a shuttle had been fueled on launch pad
39B since the Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff Jan. 28,
1986, killing its crew of seven.
   All of the problems Thursday night and today were in ground
support equipment and not on the shuttle itself.
   The first part of the countdown was to have ended this morning
with a simulated problem and postponement just 10 seconds before a
mock liftoff. The launch team then was to have emptied the fuel
tank, started a new countdown and refilled the tank, targeting the
test-firing for Monday.
   The firing will test several modifications made to the engines
and is considered critical to certifying Discovery for flight.
   The latest shuttle difficulty came a day after engineers came up
with a solution for a major problem. They recommended that cutting
a hole through Discovery's cargo bay would be the quickest and best
way to reach and fix a small gas leak in an engine compartment
without removing the vehicle from the pad.
   The recommended repair would take about two weeks. The
alternative would be to take Discovery back to a hangar, which
could postpone the flight to as late as sometime in November.
   Cutting the 20-inch-square hole through the rear of the cargo
bay would give engineers access to the tiny leak, which is on a
vent line in an engine compartment. Once they cut through they
would enshroud the leak in a clamshell device filled with a sealant.
   As a backup, the engineers recommended pushing a device
resembling a badminton shuttlecock through the 27-foot-long line,
trailed by a sealing agent.
   The two options were among several ideas tested to plug the leak
without taking Discovery off the pad.
   The leak and the delays in the engine-firing countdown have
pushed NASA's internal working launch date to Sept. 13, and
officials concede they are facing a late September launch even if
they can fix the leak on the pad.
   The managers did not commit themselves to cutting the hole,
because they want to see what happens after Discovery's three main
engines are ignited for 20 seconds.
   Engineers said the firing, in which the shuttle will be bolted
to the pad while its main engines generate ground-shaking thrust of
1.1 million pounds, could enlarge the leak or even lead to another
problem that would require a rollback from the launch pad.
   The main engines are separate from the steering engine system
that contains the leak.

   Missing Chicago newlyweds who sought ``perfect
love'' while working anonymously in California delicatessens said
they don't feel compelled to make amends for the costly police
search prompted by their disappearance.
   Scott Swanson said Thursday he believes it is the Chicago police
rank-and-file, rather than department officials, who want to see
some kind of payment because they feel ``really gypped'' that they
didn't find the college couple who dropped out of sight in April.
   ``It's like (the police said), `Here are some yuppie kids from
Wheaton College. They just took off and we have no clues and we
didn't know what to do.' And they look silly, so they might want to
retaliate,'' Swanson said.
   ``Nobody cares, it's over with,'' said a Chicago officer in the
missing persons bureau who declined to give his name.
   Chicago Police Cmdr. Ettore DiVito, who headed the
investigation, said Wednesday police might try to recover the costs
of their efforts. ``We are disheartened that we expended so many
man-hours,'' he said.
   When Swanson's expensive car was found ransacked and with the
engine running in a Chicago alley, it prompted a multistate search
as well as prayer vigils by classmates at Wheaton, a private,
evangelical Christian college.
   Swanson, 23, and his bride, Carolyn Swanson, 22, said they find
it difficult to explain why they vanished, leaving family and
friends in anguish.
   ``We feel like we're on a different level than a lot of people
in their relationship. ... Carolyn's my life, and me to her, her to
me. I would die for her and she would die for me,'' Swanson said.
   The two were pursuing a ``perfect love'' that they felt was
within reach if they escaped from the daily routine of life, said
Jim MacLean, Carolyn's father Wednesday. MacLean and his wife,
Kathy, of Haddonfield, N.J., flew to San Diego after receiving a
letter from the couple.
   ``We do forgive them, but they are going to have to put the
pieces of their lives back together themselves,'' Nancy Swanson,
Scott's mother, said Thursday from her suburban Chicago home. The
Swansons talked with the young couple by telephone but had not yet
seen them.
   The newlyweds said they revealed their whereabouts after Carolyn
was asked for her Social Security number by her delicatessen
employer, which they feared would give them away.
   Swanson said they ``don't feel worthy'' to contact their friends
right now, feeling that they failed them.
   ``It's a paradoxical situation, the hurt that we've caused and
the benefit that's come from this,'' Mrs. Swanson said.
   Swanson said they came here because they ``didn't know anyone,
and no one knew us. It has a climate that is conducive to living
outdoors if we needed to bum it for a while.''
   The couple said they intend to remain in San Diego and continue
their education. Swanson said he will pursue his goal of the
military reserve and wants to teach, while his wife said she plans
to write books.
   However, Swanson called into work Thursday, apologized and quit,
said Scott Brookes, manager of Glen Court-Four. Swanson also called
The Sandwiched Inn and said his wife wouldn't be working there any
more, said Laura Rosenthal.
   The Swansons could not be reached immediately for comment about
quitting their jobs.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Rumble Across Midsection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled across parts of the nation's midsection
earlier today after storms dropped large hail and heavy rain.
   Thunderstorms were scattered from northern Montana into northern
North Dakota, central and southwest Minnesota and southwest
Nebraska early this morning.
   Golf ball-size hail and 1-2 inches of rain fell near Miller,
S.D., Thursday evening, but many of the thunderstorms that were
rumbling over the southern Atlantic Coast and Gulf Coast regions
earlier in the day weakened by late Thursday. Many of these storms
developed due to very warm and humid air in the afternoon, then
died out as the evening air cooled.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered Thursday night over
parts of eastern Colorado and extreme western Kansas. Thunderstorms
also were widely scattered in northeast and central New Mexico.
Nearly 1\ inches of rain fell in 20 minutes in the Four Hills area
of Albuquerque, where street flooding was reported.
   Thunderstorms also were scattered over western Arizona on
Thursday evening. Strong thunderstorm winds damaged several
trailers near Surprise, Ariz.
   Widely scattered thunderstorms developed from south-central and
southeast Kansas into southwest Missouri.
   Rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT included
nearly an inch at Kennedy Airport near New York City, a half-inch
at Joplin, Mo., over a third of an inch at Alexandria, Minn., and
Huron, S.D., and over a quarter inch at Albuquerque.
   For today, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast for
the southern Atlantic and Gulf Coastal states, the lower Missouri
and middle Mississippi valleys, northeast Minnesota and the High
Plains of Colorado.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 90s across much of
the nation; in the 80s along much of the California coast, the
northern parts of the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, and
from the upper Ohio Valley into New England; in the lower 80s near
the front range of the Rockies; up to 100 degrees over parts of
north-central Texas and Illinois; and between 100 and 110 degrees
from the valleys of southwest Oregon and California into the desert
Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at Laramie and Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., and Arcata, Calif.,
to 91 at Phoenix and Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas.

   A small earthquake and aftershock shook the
towns of Packwood, Eatonville and Randle, but there were no reports
of damage, a geophysicist said.
   A quake of 4.2 on the Richter scale was recorded at 10 p.m.
Thursday, centered about 35 miles southeast of Tacoma near Mount
Rainier, said Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist at the United States
Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center in Golden,
Colo.
   An aftershock quake registering 3.9 was recorded at 11 p.m., he
said.
   Presgrave said both temblors were felt in Packwood, Eatonville
and Randle. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries,
he said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as rerded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. A reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage in a local area, while a 7 reading is a ``major'' quake,
capable of widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Blackout Hits Peru After President Lashes Out At Terrorism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police blamed leftist guerrillas for a power
outage that blacked out central Peru hours after President Alan
Garcia demanded tougher laws against terrorism.
   The outage at 8 p.m. Thursday was the second in less than 24
hours. It plunged Lima and cities along 600 miles of coastline into
darkness, said Jose Acedo, a spokesman for the state power company,
Electro-Peru.
   The blackout and an power outage Wednesday night both were
blamed on members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement,
Acedo said. He said guerrillas bombed power pylons near Lima on
Wednesday and may have done the same thing Thursday.
   Power on Thursday was restored within 15 minutes in most areas
and police said they had no reports of violence.
   Garcia vowed Thursday that Peru would step up its battle against
drug traffickers and the leftist guerrillas that defend them.
   ``The United States can count on our decided help. Peru will not
resign itself to being and exporter of poison,'' Garcia said in his
state of the nation address, referring to Peru's reputation among
international anti-drug officials as the world's cocaine cradle.
   The government said 4,400 people were arrested this week in Lima
during an operation aimed at preventing guerrilla attacks over the
Independence Days, Thursday and today.
   Garcia said leftist guerrilla violence was Peru's major problem
and proposed tougher laws to combat it, including penalties against
guerrilla leaders who do not participate in attacks and against
media that promote and justify subversion.
   ``The law now favors terrorists ... They are taking advantage of
freedom of the press,'' Garcia said in an obvious reference to the
Lima newspaper El Diaro, considered the voice of the Shining Path.
   He disclosed that an eight-year insurgency by the organization
had claimed 15,000 lives.
   Garcia also charged the Shining Path had become ``the armed hand
of Peruvian drug traffickers.''
   He did not specify what new measures the government would take
to fight drugs. U.S. officials estimate 60 percent of the world's
coca, the raw material of cocaine, is harvested illegally in the
Upper Huallaga Valley of eastern Peru.

<HEAD>Magazine: Hostages Will Be Released Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa reported
today that negotiations are under way for the release of the nine
American and nine other foreigners held hostage by Iranian-backed
factions in Lebanon.
   ``The issue of the foreign hostages held in Lebanon will find
its way to a happy ending soon,'' the magazine quoted an
unidentified informed security source as saying.
   ``High-level contacts are under way between officials of the
hostages' nations, especially the United States, and a state that
has direct influence on the hostages,'' it said.
   It quoted the source as saying that no intermediaries were
involved.
   ``A settlement to the hostages' issue will coincide with the
U.S. presidential elections'' Nov. 8, the report said. It did not
elaborate.
   The magazine gained international fame when it broke the story
of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for the release of
hostages in 1986. But most of its recent reports on the hostages
have not proved accurate.
   Iran's Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said Wednesday his
country would be prepared to help get the hostages released if
President Reagan released frozen Iranian assets.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater responded
to Rafsanjani's offer by saying: ``No deals. The clearest signal
they could send is to release the hostages.''
   The longest held hostage is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was seized in west
Beirut on March 16, 1985.

   A British soldier who was
injured when a bomb exploded in an IRA stronghold has died, the
army said.
   An army headquarters statement identified the victim as Sgt.
Michael Matthews, 27.
   His death Thursday brought the overall death toll to at least
2,663 since sectarian and political violence flared in Northern
Ireland in 1969.
   The army said Matthews was leading a police and army foot patrol
on the outskirts of Cullyhanna village in southern Armagh Wednesday
when a bomb hidden by the side of the road went off. He was wounded
in the head and body.
   Predominantly Roman Catholic south Armagh, dubbed bandit country
by the army, is a stronghold of the Irish Republican Army, the
mainly Catholic guerrilla group fighting to drive the British from
Northern Ireland.
   Army experts on Thursday defused a bomb consisting of more than
1,000 pounds of explosives packed into beer kegs hidden in a
culvert under the road between Belfast and Londonderry.
   The army said it believed the bomb was intended for one of its
patrols but that IRA guerrillas could not detonate it because of a
technical malfunction.

   Ten Sinhalese extremists and a soldier
were killed and militants torched buses on the first anniversary of
an accord aimed at ending Tamil separatist violence, police said
today.
   Most shops, offices and businesses were closed today in Colombo,
the capital, and its surburbs. Police said people were afraid to
open their businesses because of possible violence by Sinhalese
radicals opposed to the India-brokered peace accord.
   A 24-hour curfew went into effect at 6 a.m. today in the
island's south after radical Sinhalese nationalists called for a
general strike.
   Residents in the northern city of Vavuniya, about 125 miles
northeast of Colombo, said by telephone that Indian soldiers also
declared curfews in some areas in the island's north and east until
Sunday to prevent attacks by Tamil rebels.
   The peace accord is opposed both by Tamil rebels fighting for
five years for independence in the north and east of the island and
by the Peoples Liberation Front, an extremist group from the
island's majority Sinhalese community.
   The Sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority,
while the Tamils say it does not meet their demands for
independence.
   Military officials said at least 10 Sinhalese extremists were
killed by police overnight during a series of unsuccessful attacks
on government property in central and southern Sri Lanka,
strongholds of the Peoples Liberation Front.
   A Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with
extremists in Hambantota district in the south, police officials
said.
   Ten government-owned buses and two government offices also were
set ablaze by the Sinhalese radicals, said the officials, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Militants launched two unsuccessful attacks on army and police
posts in the island's south, but no casualties resulted, the
officials said.
   Electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern Sri
Lanka were cut Thursday night after Sinhalese extremists blew up
electrical transformers, he said.
   A railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a
firebomb as it pulled into Colombo, police said. Only a few
government-owned or private buses were seen running.
   In the island's north, nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers deployed
under the peace accord were put on alert after Tamil rebels called
for a demonstration to protest the peace pact.
   On Thursday, 14 Sinhalese farmers were killed by Tamil rebels
near Padaviya village, about 100 miles northeast of Colombo.
   The peace accord, signed by India and Sri Lanka on July 29,
1987, calls for the government to grant limited autonomy to
minority Tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight
for a separate Tamil nation.
   India agreed help disarm the Tamil rebels. But violence has
persisted in the Tamil areas of the north and east because the main
Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, refused to
accept the accord.
   India is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its
own Tamil minority of 60 million for the island conflict. Before
the peace pact was signed, Sri Lanka regularly accused India of
training and supplying the rebels.
   More than 8,000 people have been killed since the ethnic war
began in 1983. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million people and say they are discriminated
against by the Sinhalese. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up about 75
percent and control the government and the army.
   More than 400 people have been killed since the accord was
signed in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists.
   Most of the victims have been government officials or members of
the governing United National Party of President Junius R.
Jayewardene, who signed the accord.

<TEXT>
   Retired Adm. James A. ``Ace'' Lyons, whose name
has surfaced in connection with the Defense Department contract
fraud probe, is also the target of two Pentagon inquiries, a
newspaper reported today.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch quoted Pentagon and Navy sources as
confirming that Lyons is the subject of two inquiries independent
of the fraud investigation.
   One inquiry concerns allegations that classified documents were
mishandled, while the other focuses on allegations of misuse of
military personnel and government aircraft, the newspaper said.
   Lyons' role in the fraud investigation apparently involves his
work as a consultant for McDonnell Douglas Corp., which announced
Thursday that the former commander of the Pacific Fleet no longer
works for them.
   ``Lyons is not under contract with us anymore,'' McDonnell
Douglas spokesman James Reed said Thursday. ``His contract expired
... and we did not renew it.''
   Reed declined to comment further on the end of the relationship
or the terms of Lyons' contract, which expired about two weeks ago.
   The company hired Lyons in February to consult on issues
concerning requirements for the F-18 Hornet in the Pacific,
including Taiwan and South Korea, McDonnell Douglas said.
   An FBI search warrant served on the company last month listed
among the items sought any ``agreements, contracts, purchase
orders, invoices'' or other material related to Lyons' work for the
company after December 1987.
   Lyons has said disclosures of the fraud investigation were
``part of a smear campaign'' by his critics in the Navy.

   Two major news organizations say they will
appeal a federal judge's ruling holding the lid of secrecy on
search warrants in the wide-ranging Pentagon bribery probe.
   ``I think the decision is clearly wrong,'' Rex Heinke,
representing the Los Angeles Times, said after U.S. District Judge
David Kenyon ruled against the Times and Copley Newspapers on
Thursday.
   Attorneys for both organizations said they would go to a federal
appeals court next week to seek a reversal of the order keeping
search warrants and affidavits sealed indefinitely.
   Another request to unseal documents in the probe was denied in
Bridgeport, Conn., on Thursday by U.S. District Judge T.F. Gilroy
Daly, ruling against The Hartford Courant.
   The newspaper has not decided whether to appeal, said Managing
Editor Mike Jenner.
   The investigation, which became public last month, centers on
allegations that defense industry consultants bribed Pentagon
officials for inside information useful in winning
multimillion-dollar contracts.
   Kenyon overturned a federal magistrate's ruling July 15 granting
access to the material. The government had argued that release of
the documents might prompt targets of the probe to destroy evidence.
   Kenyon, who heard arguments from the Times, Copley, NBC and CBS,
said he did not wish ``to minimize the importance of the role of
the press, especially in matters of extreme public interest such as
the investigation concerned herein.''
   ``However, the court finds that, on balance, the public's
interest in a complete and uninhibited investigation strongly
outweighs its need for or right of access to the search warrant
affidavits at this time,'' he said.
   ``All it says is that the government has concern about possible
destruction of evidence,'' said Heinke. ``Anything is possible.
There is no showing that it is probable or likely.'
   Harold Fuson, attorney for Copley, said the government has a
responsibility to allow scrutiny of documents supporting a search.
   The documents detail searches conducted June 14 at Northrop
Corp., Teledyne Electronics, Litton Industries and the home of
defense consultant Fred Lackner. The only segments released so far
were introductions showing that wiretaps had been used in each case.
   News organizations have gone to court in several states to seek
access to search warrants and supporting documents on First
Amendment grounds.
   The Courant had sought access to affidavits used to gain search

   Norden, a subsidiary of Hartford-based United Technologies

<TEXT>
   The African National Congress has drafted
constitutional guidelines for a multiparty democracy in South
Africa in response to criticism that its political programs are too
vague, The New York Times reported today.
   The guidelines call for an independent judiciary that would
enforce constitutional guarantees including freedom of the press,
freedom of religion and freedom of association, the Times said.
   The guidelines resulted from two years of study by an ANC
committee of lawyers and political scientists, and have circulated
only within ANC ranks and to a select group of experts sympathetic
to its aim of overthrowing white rule in South Africa, the
newspaper said. They are far more specific than the ANC's 1955
blueprint, known as the Freedom Charter, it said.
   The guidelines call for a multiparty democracy but ban parties
advocating racism or tribalism, and would provide for wide
government supervision of the economy to protect the entire
population, the Times said. They do not specify whether there would
be a president or a prime minister, it said.
   ``There is a growing acceptance that apartheid cannot last,''
ANC leader Oliver R. Tambo, 72, told the Times in Lusaka, Zambia.
``But we think there should be greater clarity and consensus on
what a constitution should say.''
   The newspaper said the guidelines are a response to criticism by
some Western leaders and white liberals in South Africa that the
ANC's political program is too vague.
   The right to education, to own property, to employment and
shelter would be established as ideals, but the difficulty of
putting these into practice would be taken into account, the Times
said.
   The guidelines also call for affirmative action to fix the
historical imbalances in employment caused by apartheid, and the
scrapping of the 1913 and 1936 Land Acts, which set aside 13
percent of the country for blacks, it said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   The Times said land redistribution would be limited because
``property for personal use and consumption shall be
constitutionally protected.''

<HEAD>Cher and Boyfriend Say Media Spotlight to Blame for Incident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cher blamed pesky paparazzi and the
frustration of living under the media spotlight for a smash-up
involving a photographer's car and a Ferrari driven by her
boyfriend.
   The actress' boyfriend, Robert Camilletti, 24, also denied he
tried to run over the photographer and said he lost control of
Cher's sports car while swerving into the driveway of her home to
duck photographers camped outside.
   The wreck outside Cher's home Wednesday heavily damaged both
cars. No one was injured.
   Camilletti, a former New York bagel maker, pizza chef and
bartender, was arrested and booked for investigation of felony
assault with a deadly weapon on free-lance photographer Peter
Brandt, 35.
   In a news conference Thursday closed to most freelance
photographers and the tabloid press, Cher defended her boyfriend.
   ``I know Robert. He is not a violent man. This is not Sean Penn
and Madonna,'' she said, referring to the pugnacious actor who's
had a number of run-ins with photographers.
   She quickly added that Penn, Madonna's husband, is ``the
sweetest boy I've ever known'' and that his outbursts also were
triggered by intense media scrutiny.
   ``I never had any intention of ever hurting anyone at any
time,'' said Camilletti, who is pursuing an acting career and
recently completed shooting of ``Loverboy'' with Kate Jackson and
Kirstie Alley.
   ``He tried to kill me. He tried to run me over at a high rate of
speed,'' Brandt said after the accident. ``I was within my rights.
I would never do anything illegal.''
   Cher and Camilletti, both clad in black, went over a litany of
grievances they said stemmed from the attention the media has paid
to their relationship.
   Since Cher won an Oscar for her role in ``Moonstruck,'' she said
various publications have reported that the couple is planning to
marry, that she is pregnant, which she denied, and that she has
undergone drastic plastic surgery to maintain her willowy figure
and high-cheeked good looks.
   ``I've been doing this for 25 years, and so I'm pretty much used
to having my private life destroyed and lies told about me,'' said
Cher, who began her career in the 1960s as half of the husband-wife
singing duo Sonny and Cher.
   ``It's something that you pretty much have to get used to. After
a while it really bothers you and disrupts your family life,'' she
said. ``I'm usually pretty good about it. I'm getting really,
really angry.''

<TEXT>
   A Montana man who left his pregnant
wife and three children and vanished under mysterious circumstances
four years ago has been discovered living in Canada.
   Barrie Shaw, 40, has since remarried and is living in Edmonton
with his new wife and their 15-month-old daughter, authorities said.
   The Canadian-born Shaw planned to fly to Montana to try to clear
up his past.
   ``I'm going down to Montana to face the music,'' a tearful Shaw
said Thursday. ``I've got to clear this up, and then I'm coming
directly back here to face the music here.''
   On Wednesday, a co-worker at Canadian Home Assurance saw Shaw's
name and picture in a magazine story on missing persons and
confronted him.
   U.S. authorities said Shaw faked his own death in 1984, but Shaw
said he was suffering a nervous breakdown at the time. He was
looking for a way out of his troubled seven-year marriage, he said,
and described the events on the day he disappeared as ``a blur.''
   ``My head felt like it was in a vice and was going to explode,''
he said.
   Shaw was reported missing on July 10, 1984 after he failed to
return from a fishing trip near Helena. He left behind his wife,
Chris, and their three children, Justin, 9, Sarah-Anne, 6, and
Tyrell, 2.
   Police found Shaw's locked station wagon and his tackle box near
the edge of a river. His fishing pole was found in the water.
   Ed Schild of the Helena area sheriff's office said Shaw may face
charges of aggravated non-support for abandoning his wife and
children. But he said Shaw's first wife might have had the marriage
annulled shortly after he vanished.
   Shaw, who wandered around the United States and Canada before
settling in Edmonton in 1985, said he went back to Helena for one
weekend the year he disappeared but no one recognized him. He said
he learned his first wife had had their marriage annulled.
   Confident he was no longer married, Shaw said he came to
Edmonton and remarried in 1986.

<HEAD>New Stamps Should Stick Better, Taste Same</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN W. CHALFANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service is spending $700,000 to
come up with a stickier stamp. But don't expect it to taste any
better.
   ``Taste is a very personal thing. What we've always sought in
taste, and where we think we are, is neutral and bland. And we'd
like to stay neutral and bland,'' said Gordon C. Morison, a senior
assistant postmaster general.
   Morison opened a daylong conference Thursday at Battelle
Memorial Institute with about 100 adhesive industry executives and
technical experts on how to lick the problem of stamps that don't
stay stuck.
   The postal service has a 16-month contract with Battelle aimed
at persuading the industry to develop a gum that will keep stamps
glued to mail zipping through high-speed automated processing
equipment.
   ``Taste is in the tongue of the users, and this contract really
has nothing to do with that,'' Morison said.
   He acknowledged that the postal service regularly gets
suggestions about improving the taste of stamps.
   ``In fact, one other country, I think it was Great Britain,
tried some flavored gums at one point in time. But they got so many
complaints from the people who didn't like the strawberry or the
raspberry flavor,'' he said. ``You can't satisfy everybody because
we all have different tastes.''
   Adhesive now used by stamp manufacturers performs well when mail
is sorted manually or mechanically. But the arrival of high-speed,
automated processing, in which stamps are coated with a compound
that activates processing equipment, requires a stronger adhesive.
   ``Our letters go through our processing equipment very, very
fast. In the time that it takes for a baseball pitcher to throw a
ball 90 miles per hour, we probably process 10 letters or so in
that fraction of a second, almost,'' he said.
   ``In doing that, you are again putting a great deal of stress on
the stamp.''
   Morison said the problem is not acute yet, but some customers
have complained about letters that were destroyed or returned
because the stamps fell off.
   ``When you look at the magnitude of the postal service
operation, it's very minor because we carry so many pieces of mail
every day we have absolutely no problem with,'' he said.
   ``But when we see something developing, and we see there is an
issue here, then in that case we want to fix it, and get it fixed
very quickly.''

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A traffic cop suspected of writing more
than 1,000 bogus tickets in seven years says he didn't have the
heart to hand out the real thing.
   ``I just could not bring myself to write tickets,'' Patrolman
Michael Ghrist said Wednesday in an interview. ``I had a
conscience. I had a heart. ... I started seeing the human beings
behind the drivers' wheels.''
   Ghrist said he began to write one or two bogus tickets a week in
the names of motorists who didn't exist about a year and a half ago.
   However, Judge Donald Smalley said this week that a computer
listing of all the tickets Ghrist has written since 1981 shows that
more than 1,000 are in the names of people for whom no Kentucky
drivers license could be found.
   ``We have to assume that almost all of them are fictitious,''
Smalley said.
   Ghrist, 36, who has been with the department 17 years, was
suspended earlier this month for 25 days.
   Police Chief Richard Dotson concluded that the officer wrote
bogus tickets to maintain ``high enforcement statistics.''
   Safety Director Thomas Kuster, who suspended Ghrist, said
Wednesday he was unaware there may have been more than 1,000
questionable tickets, and Lt. Col. John Aubrey said the
investigation would be reopened.
   In a letter to Kuster, Dotson said he considered recommending
Ghrist's firing but decided on leniency because the officer was not
motivated by personal profit. For example, he passed up special pay
for court appearances.

   An Irish teen-ager who was a stowaway on
a U.S. Navy destroyer returned home today and was immediately
placed under the care of government health officials.
   Hours before 16-year-old Suzanne Twomey arrived at Shannon
Airport in western Ireland, a district court in Cork ordered her
placed under the care of the Southern Health Board, officials said.
   A spokesman for the health board, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the board made an application for custody ``in the
interests of the girl herself and after consultation with her
parents and the police.''
   He did not elaborate on the reason for the decision or give any
indication how long Miss Twomey would be under government care.
   Miss Twomey has run away from her home in Cork, southern
Ireland, several times and was once brought home from Spain after
disappearing for six months.
   ``I just want to go home,'' she told Judge Fred Morelock of
North Carolina's Wake County District Court on Thursday.
   When Miss Twomey landed after an overnight flight from New York,
she was taken through a rear airport exit away from reporters and
placed in a waiting police car. Two agents of the U.S. Naval
Investigative Service escorted her.
   An Irish police spokesman, who refused to be named, said her
parents, John and Christine Twomey, and her three siblings would
see her later.
   Miss Twomey apparently slipped aboard the USS Conyngham when it
paid a courtesy call in Cork Harbor. She was discovered aboard the
guided missile destroyer Saturday when it returned to its base in
Norfolk, Va., after a 10-day trip across the Atlantic Ocean.
   The teen-ager apparently spent the entire crossing in a 2{-foot
wide, 15-foot-long, and 3-foot high compartment above a
refrigeration unit.
   Five sailors accused of helping the girl were being held at the
Norfolk Naval base, authorities said. If charged and convicted,
they face a maximum five years in prison and a fine of $2,000
dollars for aiding an illegal entry into the United States.
   Miss Twomey's parents said they are considering suing the U.S.
government on grounds that their daughter could not have boarded
the ship without help from crew members.
   ``There is a lot more to this than meets the eye,'' Mrs. Twomey
said Thursday. She said U.S. officials had telephoned her in
Ireland to apologize.

<TEXT>
   The woman who designed the stark Vietnam
War memorial in Washington etched with the names of the dead in the
order they were killed took a similar approach in a monument to the
civil rights movement.
   The monument here will bear the names of about 30 people killed
in the battle for racial equality from 1955 to 1968.
   ``The name is one of the most magical ways to bring back a
person,'' said Maya Lin of New York. ``It's more real than any one
image can be.''
   Ms. Lin, the 28-year-old designer of the long, black marble wall
with the names of thousands of Americans killed in Vietnam, on
Thursday attended the unveiling of her plans for the civil rights
memorial, expected to cost $350,000.
   She said learning about the history behind the names was an
important step in designing the memorial. ``Since May I've read
four books on it,'' she said.
   With the Vietnam project, Miss Lin said, she stayed away from
books and documentaries about the war while working on her design
``because I didn't want to get into the politics.''
   The new memorial will sit in front of the Southern Poverty Law
Center, a Montgomery-based, public-interest law firm specializing
in civil rights issues.
   Construction will begin later this year, with completion
scheduled for May 1989. The project will be built with by proceeds
from the recent sale of property adjacent to law center.
   Ms. Lin's design calls for an upper plaza with a quiet pool and
water that cascades down the face of a curved, black wall 40 feet
long.
   Inscribed in gold leaf on the wall will be a section of the Rev.
Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream Speech,'' saying: ``We will
not be satisfied until justice rolls down like water and
righteousness like a mighty stream.''
   In a lower plaza, a circular stone table 12 feet in diameter
will be inscribed with the names of people killed during the civil
rights movement. Water emerging from the center of the table will
flow evenly across its surface.
   The memorial will begin with the 1955 slaying of Emmett Till in
Money, Miss. Till, a black man, was lynched after saying ``Bye,
baby,'' to a white woman. The historical review will end April 4,
1968, the day King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn.
   Also listed will be Medgar Evers, a Mississippi NAACP official
gunned down in front of his home in 1963; four children killed in
1963 in the bombing of a Baptist church in Birmingham, and three
civil rights activists shot to death in Philadelphia, Miss., during
the Freedom Summer of 1964.

<TEXT>
   Two members of the rival Bloods and Crips
gangs clasped hands after three days of talks that were pronounced
a success by organizers despite the failure to produce an agreement
to stop the bloodshed.
   Gang experts and civic leaders, however, were skeptical of
whether the talks were worthwhile.
   ``They'll go back into their gangs and they'll talk with their
gang members and convince them to lay down their weapons,'' said
the Rev. Charles Mims Jr., who set up the talks between 12 gang
members in this Los Angeles suburb.
   Mims and gang members present said the talks that ended Thursday
were beneficial, despite the lack of an agreement to end the gang
fighting, which has claimed more than 165 lives in Los Angeles
County this year.
   ``We want to live, man. We don't want to die. But we don't have
nothing else to do,'' said a Bloods member who called himself
Twilight. Twilight clasped hands with a member of the Crips who
called himself Twelve.
   The Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP had withdrawn support for
the talks. And although she supported the idea of talking versus
shooting, state Sen. Diane Watson said gang members should not be
``treated like ambassadors from warring nations.''
   Mims acknowledged the gang members participating are not leaders
of gangs, although he said they hold influence with their groups.
   Police estimate gang membership in Los Angeles County at
100,000. Gang members belong to hundreds of ``sets'' that are
loosely aligned as Crips, Bloods or dozens of other smaller gangs.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students shouted slogans and plastered
posters with anti-government phrases on Burma's holiest Buddhist
shrine today following changes that brought to power a political
hardliner.
   Burmese returning from worship at the gold-laden Shwedagon
Pagoda said a small number of students stood atop water tanks at
the shrine Thursday evening, gave anti-government speeches and
shouted slogans.
   The students returned before noon today, but there were no
reports of violence or confrontation with authorities.
   Some commotion erupted on the crowded pagoda grounds Thursday
when pilgrims dispersed in panic following a fight between some
youths. No injuries were reported.
   The Shwedagon Pagoda, in the northern suburbs of Rangoon, has
been a traditional gathering place for political dissenters,
including those who fought British colonialism.
   Last month, authorities surrounded and briefly closed the pagoda
after students set up a ``strike center'' designed to coordinate
anti-government protest. The students entered the pagoda precincts
following a week of rioting in Rangoon. Official accounts said nine
people died in the rioting.
   Following the June unrest which spread to other Burmese cities
and towns, the government closed virtually all universities. They
are scheduled to reopen next month.
   Students also have been spreading leaflets in the Burmese
capital denouncing Sein Lwin, who was elected both president and
chairman of the ruling political party. He succeeded Ne Win, who
wielded power for 26 years.
   According to Western and Burmese sources, Sein Lwin commanded
riot police who brutally put down student demonstrations here last
March. With a long record of harsh action against dissenters, Sein
Lwin's elevation to the country's most powerful positions is likely
to spark more unrest.
   Since October, violent, student-led demonstrations have erupted
three times. In addition to demands for greater freedom within the
military-controlled state, protesters are demanding better economic
conditions in this once prosperous country.
   Western diplomats are watching how students will act after
classes resume. On Saturday, Ne Win warned that if the army is
called out to suppress protets it would shoot ``to hit'' rather
than just scare.
   The small, Shwedagon demonstration was the first known public
protest in Rangoon since the leadership changes.
   A curfew remained in effect in the town of Myede, 220 miles
north of Rangoon, after mobs destroyed buildings and clashed with
police Tuesday. Officials said one person was killed and five
wounded.
   It was not clear whether that unrest was politically related. It
appeared to have been sparked by strife between Moslems and
Buddhists, who are the majority in Burma.
   A number of outbursts in recent months started as minor personal
or ethnic quarrels and escalated into anti-government riots.

   Soviet media today indicated that a crackdown has
begun against those agitating for Armenian control of a disputed
region in a neighboring republic.
   The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people face criminal charges in
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, following an incident in which
Armenian activists attached slogans to their cars and drove around
the city.
   The newspaper did not indicate the date or the size of the
demonstration. It said 155 drivers had their licenses revoked and
310 were fined, indicating a sizeable turnout.
   The protest involved Aremenians' demand for control of
Nagorno-Karabakh, in the republic of Azerbaijan.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-dominated area. Most Armenians
are Christians, and most Azerbaijanis are Moslems.
   Demonstrations in Yerevan and in Nagorno-Karabakh began in
February. This month, Armenian officials voted to annex the
disputed region, but Azerbaijani leaders refused.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on July 18 deemed that
Nagorno-Karabakh should remain part of Azerbaijan. The Presidium
also ordered local law enforcement agencies to ensure that order
was restored in the area.
   The official Tass news agency reported today that the situation
was stabilizing in Armenia, but it said that at ``the urging of
instigators,'' some strikes and protests continued.
   Tass said party and government leaders in the regions involved
had been penalized for failing to take appropriate action against
those organizing the unrest.
   It praised the ``vigorous stand'' taken against continued
activism.

   Florida will use the National Guard to
defend its borders against drug smuggling in a federally funded
program that could lead to wider use of the military in the state's
battle against narcotics.
   Maj. Gen. Robert F. Ensslin Jr., adjutant general of the
Department of Military Affairs, said only volunteers will be used
in the monthlong mission primarily in southeastern Florida, where
most of the drug activity is based.
   Ensslin said Thursday the Guard will concentrate on surveillance
and intelligence in the program beginning next week. ``There is a
very, very low danger quotient and practically no opportunity for
confrontation,'' he said.
   Guard personnel trained as military police or in the Special
Forces are particulary well suited for the job, Ensslin said.
   The pilot program will be evaluated within about a month to
decide whether it should be expanded, Ensslin.
   Authorities have estimated that up to 70 percent of the illegal
drugs entering the United States come through Florida, which has
1,350 miles of coastline.
   It is not the first time the Florida Guard has been used in
anti-drug work. In 1986, several units took park in a week-long

   Twenty-one Indian Sikhs who were
abandoned aboard a ship off the Danish coast will be sent back to
Belgium, police said today.
   The Sikhs had been en route to Canada aboard the Belgian coaster
Byrding, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, when the crew
abandoned ship after it developed engine trouble. They were brought
ashore Tuesday by a pilot boat.
   The Sikhs, who carried no travel documents, will be deported to
Belgium, where they boarded the ship, police spokesman John
Steffensen told The Associated Press.
   The Sikhs paid for passage to Canada in India, Steffensen said.
They arrived in Belgium by airplane a few days before boarding the
Byrding last week.
   According to Danish press reports, the men eluded Belgian police
in a rubber dinghy to board the ship waiting in international
waters. The reports said they paid $3,000 to $4,000 each for the
trip.
   The Copenhagen daily Det Fri Aktuelt quoted Belgian police today
as saying the ship's captain, Rolf Nygren, a Swedish citizen, was
arrested on a beach near Veurne south of Oostende, along with 51
Sikhs who didn't manage to board the ship.
   Nygren was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $500 last
year in Nova Scotia after attempting to help 174 Sikhs enter Canada
illegally, Det Fri Aktuelt quoted court officials in Nova Scotia as
saying.

   The chief U.S. delegate to the stalled
Helsinki conference said today the meeting ``still has a long way
to go,'' despite some progress in the human rights field by the
Soviet Union and its allies.
   The conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe had been
tentatively scheduled to end today, but delegates say it is likely
to continue into the fall.
   Despite ``some fairly substantial progress in a number of
countries, including, of course, the Soviet Union, there is still a
long way to go'' to reach agreement on a final document, U.S. chief
delegate Warren Zimmermann told reporters.
   Zimmermann said that in the Soviet Union, prisoners of
conscience and activists were in labor camps or forced exile
``because of things they have thought or things they have said.''
   ``I think time is long past when that kind of violation should
continue,'' Zimmermann said, adding that some Western radio
broadcasts, including Israeli and West German radio programs for
Soviet listeners, are still jammed in the Soviet Union.
   The Vienna meeting, attended by the Soviet Union, the United
States, Canada and all European states except Albania, began in
November 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Accords
on military security in Europe, economic cooperation and
humanitarian issues, including human rights.
   The delegates have been deadlocked over a final document.
Western delegates say the document should advance the provisions
contained in the 1975 accords and documents concluded at previous
follow-up meetings.
   Zimmermann singled for criticism a Romanian government project
to raze 7,000 villages in a nationwide resettlement plan that
critics say will destroy the traditional life of ethnic Hungarians.
   In Bulgaria, Zimmermann said, the 900,000-strong Turkish
minority was still being deprived of its ethnic rights.
   In May, Europe's nine neutral and non-aligned countries
introduced a draft compromise document designed to help East and
West reach a successful conclusion, but Western diplomats say
disagreement persists in the human rights area.
   ``We still have to get good agreement on such important issues
as freedom of religion, .... rights of national minorities and the
right of radio broadcasts to enter freely,'' Zimmermann said.
``Until we get an agreement on these issues, it's hard to see how
we can end this meeting.''

<HEAD>Judge: DeSillers Would Be `Unjustly Enriched' By Sons Donations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Money donated for Ronnie DeSillers' three liver
transplants will be used to pay medical bills, debts and help other
children in need of transplants _ and not a penny will go to the
boy's mother, a judge ruled.
   Maria DeSillers has been accused of misusing some of $689,000 in
donations that poured in before her 7-year-old son died awaiting a
fourth transplant at a Pittsburgh hospital in 1987. The donations
included $1,000 from President Reagan.
   Circuit Judge Francis Christie on Thursday refused to give Ms.
DeSillers and her former husband, Ronald, any claim to the
remaining $243,500. He said to do so would be ``erroneous and a
judicial absurdity.''
   ``To allow the contributions donated by caring and affected
American people to ... descend to Ronnie's parents ... would
unjustly enrich persons not entitled to the same,'' Christie wrote.
   The judge ordered that money in the boy's estate be used to pay
hospital bills and other debts, with any remaining money going to
other needy ill children.
   Court-appointed curator Karen Gievers, ordered to oversee the
money, hailed the decision. ``I think that this should reassure
people who gave money that it'll be used for the purpose
intended,'' she said.
   Ms. Gievers said she will try to recoup some of the $200,000 Ms.
DeSillers allegedly gave to friends and relatives or spent on such
items as jewelry and a BMW sports car.
   ``There were things done by people that should not have been
done. If they are substantial, we'll litigate,'' Ms. Gievers said.
``We'll be looking at each and every person who received the
funds.''
   The curator charges that Ms. DeSillers paid herself $96,526 from
donations, $23,700 to her boyfriend, $13,500 for the BMW, $10,850
in jewelry, $6,000 in rent for her high-rise bayfront apartment and
$8,000 in clothing and furniture. Only $44,359 was spent on other
children who required transplants, Ms. Gievers said.
   A teary-eyed Ms. DeSillers' refused to speak with reporters and
did not return a telephone call. Her attorney, Harry Robbins, said
the decision would be appealed.
   ``Maria had a dream that she wanted to realize, and now that
dream cannot come true,'' he said.
   Mrs. DeSillers is under investigation by the Dade County state
attorney's office and the Florida attorney general's office, which
are trying to determine whether she misused any of donations.
   DeSillers has denied misusing the money and said about $150,000
was sent to her directly but had been mistakenly mingled in her
son's account.

<HEAD>Dukakis Wooing Jackson Support; Focusing On Jobs Theme</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Dukakis at auto plant, subbing top 3 grafs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FLINT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis toured a General Motors plant and campaigned among United
Auto Workers today while continuing to woo supporters of former
rival Jesse Jackson.
   ``I don't care who you were with in the primary, you're all
Democrats,'' Dukakis told a crowd of about 500 people when he
arrived at the Flint airport Thursday night. ``We're going to win
the state of Michigan and win it decisively,'' said Dukakis, who
lost this state's primary to Jackson before running off a string of
victories that secured the nomination.
   Today, Dukakis got a tour of the GM plant, ending it by driving
a new Chevy Blazer off the assembly line before meeting with the
union workers. From Flint, Dukakis was headed to Racine, Wis., to
visit a minority-owned technology company that has established
retraining programs for its workers.
   He arrived here after campaign stops in Cleveland and Secaucus,
N.J., taking time at both places to depart from his standard pledge
of ``good jobs at good wages'' to step up his attack on the ethical
standards of President Reagan and Vice President George Bush _
particularly their support of Attorney General Edwin Meese III even
after two top Meese aides quit because of his legal troubles.
   ``In a Dukakis White House, the ethics office will be in the
Oval Office, not some place down the hall,'' Dukakis said in a
swipe at the handling of Meese's troubles and Bush's call for an
ethics office in the White House.
   Dukakis also took time in Ohio and New Jersey to meet with
prominent Jackson supporters, including Newark Mayor Sharpe James
and Cleveland City Council President George Forbes.
   Also at the Ohio meeting was Arnold Pinkney, Jackson's 1984
campaign manager.
   Dukakis deputy field director Donna Brazile, a Jackson aide four
years ago, described the sessions as ``very positive'' and said the
Jackson supporters, nearly all black, had pledged their support to
Dukakis.
   Dukakis said the Jackson backers were ``very enthused and ready
to go to work.''
   James, after a meeting with Dukakis in Newark, said: ``Now we
are ready to support Michael Dukakis _ he won.'' Fingering a
campaign button on his lapel, James added: ``I have now replaced my
Jesse Jackson button with a Michael Dukakis button. We're ready to
win.''
   In Ohio, during a series of live and satellite television
interviews, Dukakis faced questioning about his selection of Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate instead of the home state
favorite there, Sen. John Glenn.
   ``In the end, I just felt that Sen. Bentsen was the right
choice,'' he said.
   He also interrupted his Ohio campaigning to speak via satellite
to the United Food and Commercial Workers convention in San
Francisco, promising that if elected he would appoint members to
the National Labor Relations Board sensitive to labor needs.
   In that speech and his addresses to rallies in Secaucus and
Cleveland, Dukakis repeated many of the themes of the speech he
gave when he accepted the nomination at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta.
   ``We can take the easy road, the downhill road, or we can put
America on the path to greatness once again,'' Dukakis told the
union conference.
   At each stop he repeated his support for an increased minimum
wage, universal health care and a trade bill containing a provision
providing advance notification for workers of plant closings.
   And he said that despite economic growth during the Reagan
administration, that prosperity has reached only the ``privileged
few.'' He predicted he would defeat Bush in November because
average Americans are concerned about the country's economic future.
   ``You cannot build a strong economic future on a credit card,''
Dukakis said in Cleveland. ``We cannot continue to borrow and spend
and borrow and spend to prosperity.''
   After the Wisconsin stop, Dukakis was headed to Illinois and
Kentucky. He was to spend tonight in Kentucky and attend events
there and in North Carolina on Saturday before returning home.

   Firefighters raced the wind today in an
attempt to beat back a forest fire that raged out of control after
destroying 15 homes on the city's edge. Officials offered a $10,000
reward in the suspected arson.
   Winds dropped to 5 mph early this morning, prompting a major
assault to take advantage of the lull and cooler temperatures. The
weather service said the wind was expected to pick up again,
reaching 15 to 25 mph by afternoon.
   But higher humidity _ a boon to firefighting _ also was expected
and crews said they hoped to complete a fire line around the
3,000-acre blaze by early Saturday, a spokesman said today. The
fire was considered 80 percent contained.
   ``It's looking a lot more positive than it has,'' said Mike
Ball, fire information officer. It's the first time since the fire
started Tuesday that firefighters have estimated when they might
get a handle on the blaze.
   In Wyoming, fire crews in Yellowstone National Park today took
the calculated risk of lighting ``burnouts'' _ igniting dead timber
and brush in an attempt to keep isolated blazes from combining into
bigger fires.
   Fires fed by drought-dried fields and forests also blackened
regions of Alaska, Montana, Idaho, California, Washington and
Wisconsin.
   In Rapid City, 15 homes and 32 outbuildings had been destroyed
and 2,800 acres burned by Thursday evening.
   ``They're going to have trouble holding the lines on the south
and southeast,'' Mary Sue Waxler, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman,
said Thursday night. ``My gosh, I wish it would rain.''
   Earlier Thursday, officials evacuated hundreds more homes in
three subdivisions on the west side. On Thursday evening they
suggested that people leave another large rural area. Two
subdivisions remained evacuated today.
   Police Chief Tom Hennies said he had received no reports of
looting in the hundreds of homes left vacant.
   Volunteer firefighters saved 100 houses on Thursday, Ball said.
Small fire departments from around the state have brought in 65
engines to pump water onto houses to keep them from igniting while
the fire burns around them.
   Gov. George Mickelson offered the $10,000 reward in the
suspected arson. He said the state and businesses had put up the
money.
   A 14-year-old boy was arrested in connection with a small fire,
but police said they did not think he was responsible for setting
the main fire on Tuesday.
   In Yellowstone, officials acknowledged the risk of burnouts.
``But we'd rather burn this out under the best conditions we can
control instead of letting the fire run in on us uncontrolled,''
said Ken Briggeman, a fire official at the Shoshone blaze near
Grant Village.
   An update Thursday night by infrared mapping showed the number
of acres on fire down from 95,000 to about 93,000 in the 2.2
million acre park.
   The forecast for today called for ideal burning conditions _
good for the wildfires and encouraging for the burnouts _ with high
temperatures of 75-85 degrees and relative humidities of 15 percent
to 22 percent.
   A burnout is meant to destroy fallen trees, snags and brush in a
controlled manner to rob a fire of fuel to advance.
   In the 10,100-acre Shoshone fire, fire crews carrying hand-held
drip torches ignited brush and fallen trees Thursday, moving fast
to avoid the flare-up as the tinder-dry wood was torched.
   Meanwhile, heli-torches _ flame throwers on choppers _ continued
setting burnouts on the northeast flank of the 8,500-acre fire that
is threatening Old Faithful and the huge complex that surrounds the
famous geyser.
   ``We're happy with the burnout so far,'' said fire spokesman
Brian Fox. ``Once we get the northeast head of the fire dealt with,
it can go north, away from Old Faithful.''
   About 50 people forced from their houses by the marauding
900-acre Madison Gulch timber fire in western Montana were expected
to return to their homes today, the U.S. Forest Service said.
   In Alaska, firefighters were battling only 16 of 51 wind-whipped
fires. Bureau of Land Management spokesman Bill Rockwell said
summer fires have blackened 1.4 million acres in Alaska.
   Ten families remained evacuated from their homes near the
3,000-acre Willis Gulch fire northeast of Boise, Idaho, as the
state imposed strict fire restrictions on government land
throughout the dry southern part of the state.
   Hundreds of firefighters in Washington state continued to battle
a stubborn 3,600-acre forest fire that consumed old-growth timber
and logging trees in the Cascade Mountains.
   In California, firefighters were working on scores of small
fires throughout the Sierra Nevada range, most of them caused by
lightning. But a fire that burned about 30 acres Wednesday near
Coulterville, destroying four structures and forcing the evacuation
of up to 70 homes, was blamed on a careless 13-year-old smoker.
   Near Washburn, Wis., firefighters from Minnesota, Missouri and
Illinois joined today to help fight a fire that has burned about
350 acres at the Chequamegaon National Forest, officials said.

<HEAD>Government Sets Aug. 22 For Start Of Afternoon Pub Drinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what promises to be a minor revolution in
national drinking habits, the government has said pubs will be
allowed to stay open all afternoon beginning Aug. 22.
   The move, the first major change in pub licensing laws in
England and Wales in 72 years, was announced in the House of
Commons on Thursday by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   The change does not apply to Scotland, where pubs have been open
during the afternoons since 1977 under separate licensing laws.
   Parliament passed legislation approving the relaxation of
licensing regulations in April but left it to the government to
decide the date when pubs could start opening in the afternoon.
   Since 1916, pubs in England and Wales have had to shut down
after lunch and not open again until early evening. The 1916 law
was introduced to curb drinking by World War I munitions workers.
   Under the new law, introduced largely as a result of pressure
from the tourism industry, pubs will be allowed to stay open from
11 a.m. to 11 p.m on weekdays. Currently, weekday hours are 11 a.m.
to 3 p.m. and in most cases 5:30 or 6 p.m to 11 p.m.
   The change does not affect Sunday pub hours, which run noon
until 3 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.
   The Consumers' Association and the British Tourist Authority are
among those who welcomed the relaxation of restrictions on drinking
hours.
   But the British Medical Association has said it fears an upsurge
in alcohol-related illness and road accidents.

<HEAD>Three Charged with Murder and Terrorism for Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two white Zimbabweans and a black former
policeman were indicted today on charges of murder, terrorism and
sabotage for a car-bomb attack on guerrillas fighting the South
African government.
   Kevin Woods, 35, Michael Smith, 34, and Phillip Conjwayo, 54,
are accused of being South African agents. They were arrested after
a car bomb demolished part of a house occupied by officials of the
African National Congress in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe on Jan. 11. Some
occupants of the house were injured.
   The African National Congress is the main guerrilla group
fighting South Africa's government.
   In a brief hearing at the Chikurubi maximum-security prison near
Harare, prosecutor Yunus Omerjee said the murder charges related to
the death of Obert Mwanza, the driver of the car.
   Mwanza apparently was hired to drive the car and did not know it
was booby-trapped.
   In the hearing, the state alleged that Woods, Smith and
Conjwayo, acting as agents for Pretoria, carried out the
car-bombing and other acts of terrorism and sabotage punishable by
death or life imprisonment under Zimbabwe laws.
   Fourteen whites and three blacks are awaiting trial on capital
charges for attacks on ANC facilities in Zimbabwe.
   Woods is a former officer in Zimbabwe's central intelligence
organization. Conjwayo served as a special branch police officer
before white-ruled Rhodesia became black-governed Zimbabwe in 1980.
   The three were ordered to appear in court October 12.
   Hearings on security charges have been held in jails rather than
courts since an abortive attempt June 30 to free Woods and four
other alleged South African agents on their way from Chikurubi
prison to the main courthouse in Harare.

<HEAD>Senate Ends Impasse Over Endangered Species Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is getting ready to complete work on
strengthening the Endangered Species Act, the worldwide standard
for protecting plants and animals, after a four-year impasse was
finally broken in the Senate.
   The way was cleared Thursday when the Senate voted 93-2 for
bipartisan legislation that would give the 15-year-old protection
program more money and greater powers.
   The action capped four years of efforts by the bill's managers
to bring the package to a floor vote. Until recently, they had been
blocked by a handful of senators questioning efforts to protect sea
turtles and reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone National Park.
   Negotiators from the House and Senate now must meet to resolve
relatively minor differences between the Senate's bill and one
passed 399-16 by the House last December.
   Technically, the endangered species program has been without
legislative authorization since Oct. 1, 1985. The protection effort
has been financed year by year since then, with some $39 million
available this year.
   The House and Senate bills would authorize $56 million next
year, rising to $66 million in 1992.
   The basic law, enacted in 1973, prohibits trade in species
considered endangered or threatened and requires the government to
take affirmative steps to foster their survival and take no actions
that would hasten their demise.
   There are now nearly 1,000 species on the Fish and Wildlife
Service's endangered-threatened list, about 400 of them found in
this country.
   There are about 1,000 species awaiting formal listing. Sen.
George Mitchell, D-Maine, floor manager of the Senate bill, said
that at current spending levels it would take until 2020 to end
this backlog.
   Environmentalists say some 80 species have become extinct while
awaiting listing and that another 300 may have passed the point of
no return. The House and Senate bills would require more intensive
monitoring of the condition of species awaiting listing.
   Both bills would increase the civil and criminal penalties for
violations of the protection law and attempt to close a loophole
that has allowed the destruction of endangered plants on private
property.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said that conservationists worldwide
were watching the Senate because the U.S. law is ``a model for the
entire world.''
   ``One of these rare species may hold the cure to cancer,'' he
said. ``The extinction of a single species can be an act of the
utmost recklessness. ... Extinction is an awesome act of finality.''
   Mitchell called the plan ``a strong statement to our continuing
commitment to protect these plants and animals on the brink of
extinction.''
   The House passed a renewal bill in 1985, but it died because a
handful of Westerners were able to keep the issue off the Senate
floor. This year, Western opposition, centering on water rights and
control of predators like wolves and grizzly bears, was muted.
   But Southern lawmakers convinced Mitchell to accept language
that would delay the Reagan administration's efforts to force
shrimp fishermen to use devices to prevent dwindling numbers of sea
turtles from being snared and drowned in their nets.
   Under the amendment offered by Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
turtle excluder devices would not be required in offshore waters
before next May or in inshore waters before May 1990. In the
interim, the National Academy of Sciences would study factors
affecting turtle mortality in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of
Mexico.
   John Fitzgerald of the Defenders of Wildlife said
species-protection groups could live with the amendment, which set
up easy Senate passage of the bill.
   ``We're confident the study will confirm that these turtles are
highly endangered and that the devices are necessary,'' he said.
   The only ``no'' votes in the Senate were cast by Republicans
Steve Symms of Idaho and Jake Garn of Utah.

<TEXT>
   Unless the scales of justice tip in
his favor in the next few days, an 800-pound man unable to get out
of bed will be evicted from his home, hoisted by a forklift and
hauled off on a flatbed trailer.
   Michael Edelman, who fell out of bed in December and needed a
tow truck to get up, lost an appeal of the eviction Thursday.
   His landlord, Ronald Fish, wants to level the dilapidated
bungalow where Edelman has lived with his mother for two years in
order to redevelop the land for single-family homes in this suburb
north of New York City.
   Edelman's attorney, George Rosenbaum, says he'll fight any
attempt to use a forklift to remove his client. He said Edelman
could be removed as early as next week.
   ``My understanding is that if Michael is touched and if they try
to move him, his health would be jeopardized,'' Rosenbaum said.
``We're putting the county and police on notice that to touch him
would jeopardize his health.''
   Ken Seltman, a spokesman for Westchester County, said the county
probably will seek an independent physician's opinion before
removing Edelman.
   The county concluded earlier that the best way to remove him
would be to hoist him by forklift onto a Highway Department flatbed
truck.
   ``If this could hurt him, we'll ask a judge what to do,''
Seltman said.
   Real estate agents have failed to find a place for the pair to
live because of Edelman's size. The county also has unsuccessfully
sought land for a trailer his landlord was willing to give him.
   Edelman, 24, has been accepted into an obesity program at St.
Luke's Hospital in New York City but said he doesn't want to go
because the program won't accept his mother, who weighs about 400
pounds.

   Treasures hoarded by China's emperors for more
than 2,000 years go on display here today, with jewels, terra cotta
warriors, a golden dragon throne and jade burial costume rivaling
the splendors of King Tut.
   More than 90 percent of the 221 artifacts on loan from the
People's Republic of China in the Son of Heaven exhibit have never
been seen in the United States, and 80 percent have never left
China, officials said.
   ``Through it, all Americans will come to know China as few in
the world ever have,'' former President Richard Nixon said in a
letter to his brother Ed, who lives in the Seattle area, that was
shared with Chinese officials.
   The scope and quality of the exhibits are the greatest ever lent
by the Chinese government, according to Xie Chengsheng of China's
Ministry of Culture.
   Nixon, who normalized U.S. relations with China in the early
1970s, wanted to attend today's opening but couldn't for health
reasons, said Jeri McDonald of Son of Heaven Inc., a local group
that helped organize the exhibit.
   The 74-year-old former president, who lives in Saddle River,
N.J., had prostate surgery last month.
   The exhibit, which promoters say is four times larger than the
King Tut show that thrilled America a decade ago, was created
largely from archaeological discoveries and research in China since
the Communists took power in 1949. Its treasures come from 21
museums and institutions in eight provinces and Beijing.
   The exhibit at the Seattle Center, coming soon after the success
of the Academy Award-winning movie ``The Last Emperor,'' is
expected to draw more than a million people before closing Dec. 31.
It will move to Columbus, Ohio, for a March-September run before
returning to China.
   ``The objects in this exhibition reflect the special traits of
Chinese art as well as the high level of archaeological discoveries
and research in contemporary China,'' Xie said here earlier this
summer.
   ``By sharing them, we hope to strengthen the bonds of mutual
friendship and understanding between our two countries,'' said Xie,
who led a delegation from the Cultural Relics Bureau that selected
Seattle and Columbus for the two-city tour.
   Preview glimpses of the exhibit were offered Thursday.
   It consists of a video show on China's imperial history and five
galleries illustrating the emperor's ritual, public and private
life, his role in Chinese religious teachings and his belief in an
afterlife.
   The emperor of China was considered the son of heaven, and was
believed to own and control everything under heaven.
   Like high officials of 18th century China, visitors approach a
dragon throne of gold, silk and lacquer, with peacock feathers
above and an intricate carpet beneath that represents imperial
China in a time of great strength.
   While not arranged chronologically, the exhibit illustrates how
emperors lived and ruled over 26 centuries from 221 B.C. until 1911.
   Among the treasures are a set of 26 bells from the 6th century
B.C., robes only the emperor could wear, paintings, jewelry,
household items, and a 2nd century jade burial suit believed to
possess magical properties to preserve the body of the princess
placed inside it for eternity.
   The life-size terra cotta figures, four warriors and two horses,
were selected from thousands found near the famed tomb of Qin
Shihuang Di in Xian, in central China, in 1974.
   The exhibit was planned over nearly four years by the Chinese
Overseas Archaeological Exhibition Corp. of Beijing, a division of
the Ministry of Culture, and Son of Heaven Inc.
   The idea for the show came from Deng Pufang, son of Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed it to Harvey West, a former
director of the University of Washington's Henry Art Gallery, Ms.
McDonald said. West arranged for private sponsorhip of the exhibit.
   General admission to the show is $7.50. The proceeds will
benefit Chinese archaeology and other causes.

   Workers formed a human chain and
waded into the Niagara River rapids to rescue four people who clung
to rocks 40 feet above the falls for about an hour after their boat
capsized, authorities said.
   The four began drinking on the 26-foot boat Wednesday evening at
a marina in Chippawa, Ontario, and were unaware they had drifted so
close to Horseshoe Falls, the celebrated 158-foot drop on the
Canadian side of the border, authorities said.
   No one was steering, said Sgt. James Dugos of the Niagara
Regional State Parks Police. ``I'm very much surprised that all
four people were saved,'' he said.
   The four abandoned the boat when it capsized 40 yards from the
brink of the falls and were rescued early Thursday, suffering only
bumps and scrapes. The $130,000 boat was swept over the falls and
destroyed.
   David Shand, 34, said he thought he and his companions would die
as they clasped the rocks with the roar of the falls in their ears.
   ``You had to be out there,'' said the owner of the boat, David
Mason, 35. ``It's like something you dream about in the middle of
the night.''
   A camper in Goat Island State Park heard the four screaming and
called for help.
   Warning signs and the rapids of the upper Niagara River usually
discourage boaters from getting too close to the falls.
   No charges have been filed against the four, all residents of
Niagara Falls, Ontario.

   A royal snafu has erupted over a dry
cleaner's insistence on using the nickname she has had since
childhood: Lady Di.
   The British government frowns on anyone taking the royal
family's names in vain, including Diana, wife of Prince Charles,
and twice has asked Diane Storoni to rename her establishment in
Vista, about 45 miles north of San Diego.
   ``It's my name and I'm not going to change it for anybody,''
said Storoni, who says her family has called her Lady Di since she
was a baby. ``That's that. I, personally, don't think she (the
Princess of Wales) cares about this.''
   Angus Mackay, spokesman at the British consulate in Los Angeles,
said the names of members of the royal family are ``never used in
commercial solicitation either in Britain or anywhere in the
world.''
   He also doesn't like the way Storoni advertises her company as
``Cleaners to the Royal Family.'' The radio commercial features an
impersonation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The advertisement ``cheapens not only the royal family
themselves, but also the humanitarian values with which they are so
closely associated around the world,'' Mackay wrote in a June 14
letter.
   Mackay said the consulate has received several letters from
local residents offended by the ads.
   He said a British company can advertise that it provides goods
or services to the royal family only if designated ``by appointment
to the royal family.''
   ``We simply wanted to make the company aware of all of that,''
he said, ``and it's really up to the company to decide what they
want to do. We certainly don't intend to take it any further.''
   But Storoni does. She wants to open a Lady Di plant in London
next year.
   And for anyone who is offended, her business partner, Gennaro
Marinelli, said, ``Perhaps you might suggest a little less starch
in their laundry.''

<HEAD>Jackson's Secret Service Protection Extended One Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan approved a 30-day extension
of Secret Service protection for Jesse Jackson, at a cost of
roughly $600,000, because of Jackson's concerns regarding threats
against his life, Reagan's spokesman said today.
   Marlin Fitzwater said the president would not approve extension
of the protection through the fall election campaign.
   Reagan's decision authorized an extension from the day after the
Democratic National Convention concluded to Aug. 22.
   Fitzwater said Jackson's request for an extension was ``based on
his assessments of threats against his life and his plan to be an
active participant'' in the campaign.
   Jackson's Secret Service protection technically was to have been
withdrawn on July 22, after his presidential candidacy ended with
the Democratic nomination of Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
But Fitzwater said the protection had been maintained without
interruption while Reagan weighed whether to approve the extension.
   Fitzwater said the 30-day extension would give Jackson a
transition period in which to arrange for private bodyguards.
   ``The feeling was that, first of all, he's not the nominee of
the party,'' the spokesman said.
   However, he said there had been precedents for extending normal
Secret Service protection for government officials because of
extenuating circumstances.

   Michael Dukakis courted blue-collar voters and Jesse Jackson
supporters today in Michigan, a state that Jackson won during the
primary season, as Vice President George Bush made another push for
his child-care plan and continued his search for a running mate.
   Dukakis' running mate Lloyd Bentsen was on a solo voyage for the
Democratic ticket, wooing independent-minded Westerners whose
suspicion of big government previously drew them to President
Reagan.
   In Washington, Reagan approved a 30-day extension of Secret
Service protection for Jackson, at a cost that Reagan's spokesman
estimated at $600,000. He said the protection would end Aug. 22.
   Marlin Fitzwater said Jackson's request was ``based on his
assessments of threats against his life and his plan to be an
active participant'' in the campaign.
   Dukakis toured a General Motors plant in Flint, driving a Chevy
Blazer off the assembly line, and then spoke to several hundred
United Auto Workers, many of them laid off from other plants,
outside their union hall.
   He said full employment would be his No. 1 priority as
president, and he told the autoworkers that something must be done
about the hard times that have lingered in parts of the nation as
the economy has recovered on both coasts.
   ``If there's one thing I want to do as president of the United
States, it's to bring those kind of jobs and that kind of future to
every community in the United States,'' he said. ``You need a
president who will work with you, a president who won't settle for
second-best or second-rate.''
   Bush told reporters today that he expects to select a running
mate before the Republican National Convention next month in New
Oreleans but ``I will keep my own counsel'' on the selection.
   While saying that his choice for the No. 2 spot on the GOP
ticket was important, Bush said, ``I really believe the election
will be decided at the presidential level.''
   Asked whether there were any prospective running mates left to
be contacted by him, Bush said, ``Maybe.''
   The vice president spoke with reporters as he toured a
company-sponsored child care center in Tysons Corner, Va., near
Washington.
   Bush, who has proposed a $1,000-per-child tax credit primarily
aimed at low-income working mothers, voiced opposition to a $2.5
billion Democratic child care plan that gives the federal
government a more direct role.
   ``I am absolutely convinced the problem is so big and so diverse
that the federal government alone cannot have a bricks-and-mortar
child care program that's going to be effective. You have to have
choice, parental choice, family choice, and you have to have
diversity,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis, who lost Michigan to Jackson but went on to secure the
nomination with a string of primary victories, said to a crowd of
about 500 people when he arrived in Flint Thursday night, ``I don't
care who you were with in the primary, you're all Democrats.''
   Also in Michigan today, John Jacob, president of the National
Urban League, said in Detroit that Bush had declined an invitation
to address next week's league conference. Dukakis will appear
before the group Monday night and Jesse Jackson will speak
Wednesday.
   As for Bush's running mate, the vice president says he hopes to
have a tentative list completed by week's end, but plans to delay
his final selection until the Republican National Convention on
Aug. 15-18. ``The process is going along in an orderly fashion,''
he said Thursday.
   Those reached include former rivals Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, Dole's wife, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, and several whose names did not figure in
earlier speculation. Among those are Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind..
   Campaign sources said Bush's list to date also includes Sens.
Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., William L.
Armstrong, R-Colo.; John Danforth, R-Mo. and Nancy L. Kassebaum,
R-Kan.; Govs. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, John Sununu of New
Hampshire, Carroll A. Campbell of South Carolina and George
Deukmejian of California; and former Govs. Lamar Alexander of
Tennessee and Richard Thornburg of Pennsylvania, who recently was
nominated by President Reagan to be attorney general.
   Bentsen, in a speech Thursday in Reno, Nev., told the National
Conference of State Legislators, ``If there is one lesson we have
learned in recent years, it is that the federal government can't
solve all of the (nation's) problems.''
   Mindful of Dukakis' promise of an activist government, he added,
``But Washington can lead.''
   Jackson, no longer a presidential candidate, returned to his
brand of diplomacy, saying he has asked the United Nations
secretary-general to ask Iranian officials for assistance in
freeing U.S. hostages held by Iranian sympathizers in Lebanon.
   Dukakis said he was unfamiliar with the facts about Jackson's
effort, ``but as a general matter private citizens should not try
to conduct foreign policy.''
   Dukakis' post-convention high in the polls continued Thursday,
as a Harris poll gave him an 18-point lead over Bush. But pollster
Louis Harris said such a wide margin was likely to be temporary.
   Harris' survey of 1,268 likely voters found 57 percent support
for Dukakis to 39 percent for Bush. It was the fourth national poll
since the Democratic convention last week to find a Dukakis lead of
that magnitude.
   The new Harris poll was done July 22-25 and had a margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points.

   Playboy Bunnies in cotton-tail costumes
will dip their last bunny dips tonight when the last Playboy Club
in America closes.
   The Hilton Inn dropped its Playboy Club franchise to ``create a
new image'' for the lounge connected to its hotel. ``It sometimes
discourages group meeting planners from selecting the Lansing
hotel,'' sales director Shelly Ahlers said.
   The club, which opened in 1982, was the last holdout in a
28-year tradition. Franchises in Des Moines and Omaha closed at the
end of April, while Playboy Enterprises Inc. shut down all the
clubs it owned in 1986.
   Nearly 30 Playboy Clubs sprang up around the United States after
Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner opened the first in Chicago in 1960.
   Every club followed the Hefner formula: waitresses served drinks
while perched on spike heels and squeezed into figure-hugging,
strapless, low-cut satin costumes accessorized with tuxedo collars,
cuffs, fluffy white tails and bunny ears.
   Playboy bunnies were trained to serve drinks by ``dipping''
demurely rather than bending over.
   When he closed the Playboy-owned clubs, Hefner said they had
become ``passe'' and ``too tame for the times.''
   After tonight, anyone interested in patronizing a Playboy Club
will have to go to the Orient.
   The Lansing club had a reunion Thursday of all the Playboy
bunnies who ever served cocktails there.
   Tonight, a reunion is planned for the people who were
card-carrying club members before low attendance forced the owners
to throw away the key cards and let anyone in. ``Business has been
so slow,'' club Manager Jeff Collar said.
   On Saturday, club memorabilia will be auctioned for charity.
   The closing, announced earlier this month, gave both the club
and hotel a boost as former customers, curiosity seekers and
reporters descended to witness the end of an era.
   ``The bunnies are getting pretty good at interviews,'' Collar
said.

<HEAD>Koop Says Resources Should Be Mobilized to Fight Tobacco Addiction</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 6-8, Charles O. Whitley, and adds last 2 grafs,
Whitley said, with Tobacco Institute response.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said today the
nation should mobilize resources to fight tobacco addiction as it
has to fight illicit drugs.
   ``We should give tobacco use and tobacco addiction the serious
attention it deserves,'' Koop told a House subcommittee. ``Our
nation has mobilized enormous resources to wage a war on drugs _
illicit drugs.
   ``We should also give priority to the one addiction _ tobacco
addiction _ that is killing more than 300,000 Americans each
year,'' he said.
   Koop testified before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on health and the environment on a 618-page report he issued in May
in which he said, ``Careful examination of the data makes it clear
that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting. An
extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug in
tobacco that causes addiction.
   ``Moreover, the processes that determine tobacco addiction are
similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin
and cocaine,'' he wrote.
   Charles O. Whitley, representing The Tobacco Institute, said,
``To call smoking an `addiction' trivializes, and almost mocks, the
serious narcotic and other hard drug problems faced by our society
and undermines efforts to combat drug abuse.''
   Whitley said that Koop proclaimed in 1982 that young people are
addicted to video games.
   ``The escalation of antismoking rhetoric by the surgeon general
in his latest report is similarly without medical or scientific
foundation _ as a number of public health officials have
recognized, and as the 41 million Americans who have topped smoking
attest,'' he said.
   Koop told the House subcommittee that more than 2,000 scientific
articles were reviewed in preparing the report.
   Koop told the panel that tobacco, like other addictions, can be
treated effectively.
   ``A wide variety of behavorial interventions have been used for
years,'' he said. ``In recognition of the important role that
nicotine plays in maintaining tobacco use, nicotine replacement
therapy is now available.
   ``Nicotine gum has been shown to relieve withdrawal symptoms
following smoking cessation, and may enhance the effectiveness of
behaviorial treatments,'' he said.
   National surveys indicate that 75 percent to 85 percent of
smokers would like to quit, he said.
   ``More than 40 million Americans have been able to quit smoking,
despite the addiction,'' Koop told the subcommittee. ``For many
smokers, a genuine desire to quit and, if necessary, persistent and
repeated attempts to quit may be all that is necessary. For others,
self-help materials, formal treatment programs and nicotine
replacement therapy may be needed.''
   Whitley said Koop's report ``is a political document.''
   ``Its conclusions conform with the surgeon general's political
goal of a smokeless society, and undoubtedly were reached long
before the report was drafted,'' he told the committee. ``By
branding cigarette smoking an `addiction' - a term with deeply
pejorative moral and social connotations _ the Surgeon General
obviously hopes to strengthen the antismoking cause generally and,
by his own admissions, hopes to make it easier for plaintiffs to
prevail in tobacco product liability cases.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev today urged the
nation's Communist Party leadership to reform the government to
broaden personal freedoms and make it more responsive.
   The official Tass news agency said a plenary meeting of the
party Central Committee opened today on ``practical work to
implement the decisions of the 19th All-Union Conference'' of the
party, which called this month for reform.
   A spokesman at the Central Committee's information department
confirmed shortly after 6 p.m. that the meeting had finished its
work, but declined to say what orders the policy-making body issued
or whether any changes were made to the ruling 13-man Politburo.
   ``You will have to wait for the official announcements,'' said
the committee spokesman. He spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Western and Soviet sources had predicted that at least one
long-standing member of the leadership would tender his resignation
at the gathering, perhaps setting a precedent for orderly
retirement from the ruling body where members have traditionally
served for life or been voted out in disgrace.
   
   The Politburo decided July 4 to call together the Central
Committee's more than 300 members. It said then it was preparing
proposals for the committee on implementing ``reforms of the
political system, the democratization of party, state and social
life.''
   Resolutions on major changes in Soviet government institutions
and internal party practices were adopted by a 5,000-delegate
national party conference that met in the Kremlin June 28-July 1.
   Revamped institutions of central government are to be in place
by next spring, the conference said. The party also has been
ordered to review the qualifications of each of its 20 million
members this year.
   Gorbachev, the party's general secretary, says the Soviet Union
must transform itself into a country ruled by law to prevent a
lapse into the repression of the Stalin years and the corruption
and stagnation allowed under President Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   The conference resolutions call for broad and varied changes
ranging from an end to bureaucratic meddling in agriculture to a
declaration that citizens should have access to all information not
classified as military or state secrets.
   The conference also ordered the party to get out of the business
of running the economy and government administration and to
concentrate on setting the ideological agenda of the nation's 284
million citizens.
   But the documents adopted unanimously by the delegates usually
speak only in general terms of Gorbachev's goals for political
reform. The Central Committee is expected to flesh them out and
come up with a specific timetable and methods to implement them.
   The committee also is empowered to make changes in the Politburo
and the Secretariat, the top party body that runs the country's
day-to-day affairs, but no reshuffling of the top Kremlin
leadership is expected.
   The last Central Committee plenum, on May 23, did not make any
personnel changes. But at its previous session, on Feb. 17-18, the
Central Committee removed former Gorbachev protege Boris N. Yeltsin
from his non-voting seat on the Politburo. Yeltsin had been fired
as Moscow party leader in November.
   The plenum also might shed light on Gorbachev's proposal for a
powerful new presidency. The post apparently is designed for
Gorbachev himself, whose job as party chief now makes him the No. 1
figure in the collective Kremlin leadership.
   The Soviet presidency, held by former Foreign Minister Andrei A.
Gromyko, now is a largely ceremonial post. Gorbachev asked that the
office also include control over domestic, international and
defense policies.
   But there was no mention of those powers in the official
documents adopted by the party conference.

   A McDonald's restaurant has lifted its
nighttime ban on customers under 16, says a lawyer for a

   The age-discrimination suit, filed by attorney Gloria R. Allred,
alleged that Tracy Tellez was told to leave the Valencia restaurant

teen-age vandalism.
   ``I'm glad this is settled because I think teen-agers should be
treated equally,'' the girl said as she ate a McDonald's
cheeseburger in Allred's office Thursday.
   A spokesman for the restaurant said the policy against
youngsters after 9 p.m. had already been rescinded when the suit
was filed March 15.
   The policy was initiated earlier this year after Friday night
crowds tore out chairs and defaced table tops with graffiti,
employees said.

<HEAD>U.S.,Greece Conclude Eighth Round of Base Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek and American negotiators today
wrapped up an eighth round of talks on a new U.S. military bases
agreement to replace an accord that expires in December.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said the negotiations
were held in a ``professional atmosphere'' but added that there
``continued to be a difference of views on the issues being
discussed.''
   Negotiations for a new U.S. base agreement are moving more
slowly than U.S. officials would like.
   On July 13, the government issued a formal shut-down notice for
all U.S. military bases operating in Greece. The notice, a legal
formality, is not expected to result in any of the bases being
closed.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou insists that the United States should
help solve Greek-Turkish disputes over military control of the
Aegean and the divided island of Cyprus in return for a new base
agreement.
   But the United States doesn't want to link a new accord with
regional politics.
   Kostopoulos described as ``completely inaccurate'' a report in
Jane's Defence Weekly that U.S. air base facilites in Athens would
be transferred to Souda Bay in Crete.
   According to the report, the United States agreed to remove the
U.S. Air Force base from Hellenikon Airport and transfer it to
Souda Bay in Crete as part of an ``alternative solution.''
   Since the 1950s, the United States has operated four military
bases in Greece _ two near Athens and two on the southern island of
Crete. As a form of rent for the bases, Greece receives more than
$300 million yearly in U.S. military credits.
   Papandreou, who came to power in 1981 pledging to shut down the
American bases, now says his socialist government is willing to
sign a new agreement, provided it is first approved in a referendum.
   Further negotiations are scheduled for September in Athens,
Kostopoulos said.

   Police today ordered the film
``Cry Freedom'' seized from theaters across the country, hours
after the government gave permission for it to be shown.
   Police Commissioner Hendrik de Witt issued the order in the
evening under state of emergency regulations. The order came less
than nine hours after the Publication Appeals Board, the
government's censorship body, announced the film could be shown.
   ```Cry Freedom' endangers the safety of the public, the
maintenance of public order and will delay the termination of the
(25-month) state of emergency,'' de Witt said in a statement. He
said the film contained ``propagandistic elements'' likely to
encourage unrest and was biased against police.
   Thirty theaters began showing the movie this morning, a half
hour after permission was granted. The first showing at a downtown
Johannesburg cinema attracted about 200 viewers, white and black,
to a 350-seat theater.
   Blacks in the audience cried and sang along with the soundtrack
at various emotional scenes during the film. Several left the
theater in tears.
   Movie-goers said police began arriving at theaters in the
evening with orders to confiscate the film.
   The Publications Appeals Board ruled that the film, about the
friendship between Biko and white journalist Donald Woods, could be
shown uncut to viewers at least 19 years old.
   Later, the Justice Ministry noted that it had not given
permission to quote Woods, as actor Kevin Kline does in the film,
because of Woods' banned status under national law.
   There were explosions at two theaters where the film was to be
shown, police said. There were no injuries at either of the
theaters, the Kings Cinema in the Alexandra township outside
Johannesburg and the Metro theater in downtown Durban, authorities
said.
   Police reported bomb threats at theaters in Durban, Pretoria,
and Port Elizabeth.
   ``Cry Freedom'' had been scheduled to open today after
government censors last November approved showing it without cuts
or age restrictions. But Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha on
Monday ordered the board to reconsider. He did not give a reason.
   The movie, directed by Richard Attenborough and filmed in
neighboring Zimbabwe, stars Denzel Washington as Biko and Kline as
Woods.
   Biko died in 1977 in police custody after founding and promoting
the black consciousness movement in South Africa.
   Kobus van Rooyen, head of the censorship board, called the film
a ``mediocre product'' that had ``obvious and blatant bias against
the (South African) police.''
   But he added: ``The board came to the conclusion that the film
does not present a risk to race relations or to the security of the
state.''
   The script is based on two books by Woods, who fled fled the
country after Biko's death.
   Some black youths said they were let out of school to see the
film.
   ``It's a good film. If whites could see it maybe they would
change their minds,'' said one black teen-ager who saw it.
   ``The brutalities and all those things (in the film) happened to
us,'' said the youth, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Right-wing whites labeled the film leftist propaganda. Some
blacks criticized it, saying it overemphasizes Biko's association
with Woods.
   No one was officially found responsible for Biko's death, and
the film does not portray what happened to him in police custody
after his arrest for violating a banning order that restricted him
to his home in Port Elizabeth.
   But Biko is shown unconscious, bruised, frothing at the mouth,
lying naked and handcuffed in a cell. The film shows policemen
tossing him naked into the back of a truck and his head knocking
against the floor as he is driven hundreds of miles to Pretoria,
where he died in the prison hospital.
   Those details are all based on evidence at the inquest into his
death.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Somalia and Ethiopia have agreed to
exchange thousands of prisoners of war, the official Somali radio
reported Friday.
   Somalia will release 3,507 Ethiopian and one Cuban POW, and
Ethiopia will free 229 Somali POWs, the radio said.
   The agreement was reached Thursday by top officials meeting in
the Somali capital of Mogadishu, said Radio Mogadishu. The report,
monitored in Nairobi, said a joint committee will supervise the POW
exchange.
   Most of the prisoners were captured during the East African
neighbor's war 11 years ago over an arid region known as the Ogaden.
   Ethiopia and Somalia signed a peace accord April 6 in which they
agreed to withdraw troops from their borders, a move that was
completed in mid-May.
   They also agreed to exchange prisoners and to restore diplomatic
relations, which were severed at the outbreak of the war. The war
started when Somalia invaded the Ogaden, which is populated by
ethnic Somalis.

   Many people complain that taxi
drivers talk too much, but in Frankfurt some are getting paid to be
chatterboxes.
   Taxi driver Michael Linke knew he was onto something when he
noticed how many Frankfurt visitors asked cabbies to show them the
sights.
   ``We decided to bone up on culture and history, and offer
quality tours,'' Linke told The Associated Press.
   After 10 weeks of classes on city history and culture, Linke and
20 other cabbies had to pass a four-hour exam by the city
transportation office.
   ``We had to write down all we knew about Goethe's life and
works, and give the names of Kaisers and their significance for
Frankfurt,'' Linke said.
   Twenty-three cabbies have been certified by the city as official
tour guides. The tour costs $50, which can be split by up to four
passengers.

   Police arrested two men on Friday who are
wanted by the U.S. authorities in connection with a drug syndicate
that smuggled heroin into the United States in the bodies of dead
fish, authorities said.
   A police statement said the two men _ a Chinese and a
Chinese-American _ were arrested at their homes in this British
colony.
   The two, whose names were not released, will appear before a
magistrate on Saturday for extradition proceedings, the statement
said.
   Authorities arrested 11 alleged members of the syndicate after
police in Shanghai on March 9 found eight pounds of heroin stuffed
in packets and sewn into the bodies of dozens of fish. The heroin
was found in 25 boxes of fish that were to be flown to San
Francisco by China's national airline, CAAC.
   The 11 people arrested in connection with the heroin seizure
included six apprehended in China, three in the United States and
two in Hong Kong.

   A man has been arrested with a friend on
charges they murdered the man's wife and tried to make it look like
a burglary, police said.
   Paul Sloan, 27, wanted to get out of his marriage, keep custody
of his 4-year-old son and collect $91,000 on a life insurance
policy on his wife, said Detective Bill Mulloy.
   Sloan and Gordon James King, 28, were charged with murder
Thursday.
   Sloan told police Tuesday that he was hit in the back of the
head with a gun and his wife shot in the face by an intruder in
their home in the middle of the night.
   Investigators said the story did not match evidence at the
scene, and Sloan then confessed. King was the ``intruder'' and
Sloan shot his wife, Mulloy said.

<TEXT>
   The chief of a rocket fuel plant
destroyed in an explosion May 4 says he will contest $36,455 in
fines for 30 alleged safety violations.
   The Nevada Division of Occupational Safety and Health is seeking
the fines against Pacific Engineering and Production Co. The blast
killed two employees at a Henderson plant, injured 326 others and
caused about $73 million in damage.
   The fines were disclosed Thursday by Joseph Kirkbride,
information director for the U.S. Department of Labor's regional
office in San Francisco. Under state law the Nevada agency is
barred from discussing the case.
   Fred Gibson, chairman and chief executive officer for the
company, called the allegations ``wholly without merit, all of
them, based on unsubstantiated allegations that have not yet been
proven.''
   ``We have asked for the evidence and whatever other data these
charges are based on. DOSH has absolutely refused to furnish us
anything,'' he added.
   ``We understand these charges are based on interviews subsequent
to the May 4 explosion, so there is no evidence other than the
allegations.''
   Gibson said the company will contest the fines before an
occupational safety and health review panel and, if ncessary, in
court.
   Company executives blamed the explosion on a leaking natural gas
line that ran under the plant, but the Clark County Fire Department
said earlier this month that it was sparked by a welder's torch.
   Fire Chief Roy Parrish said 8.5 million pounds of ammonium
perchlorate, a fuel oxidizer used in the space shuttle and military
missiles, was destroyed in the series of blasts at the plant 20
miles from Las Vegas.
   The charges include four willful violations such a exposing
employees to possible fire or explosion through a lack of
manufacturing controls and operating procedures, Kirkbride said.
   The state also charged a lack of emergency evacuation and
response procedures, inadequate access to respirators and a lack of
entry procedures exposed workers to potentially hazardous levels of
toxic fumes, suffocation and death.

<HEAD>Black Lawman To Join Texas Rangers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY FIKAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ranks of the elite Texas Rangers will
be joined in September by a lawman believed to be the first black
to serve in the 165-year-old peacekeeping force, the Department of
Public Safety says.
   ``I feel pretty good. It's been an ambition of mine for many
years,'' said Lee Roy Young Jr., 41, a 14-year DPS veteran who
currently is an investigator assigned to the criminal intelligence
service in San Antonio.
   DPS officers, also known as state troopers, have duties similar
to state police or highway patrolmen in other states.
   The Rangers, also within the DPS, are an elite force assigned to
major crimes such as hostage-takings or long-standing murder
investigations. They also are called on by authorities in small
towns and less populated counties for help with homicides.
   Rangers have a good reputation and are highly trained, DPS
spokesman David Wells said Thursday. But the DPS has been dogged by
charges of racial discrimination in recent years. There are five
Hispanic Rangers and no women Rangers, Wells said. The National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People has threatened to
sue.
   Michael Scott, a black state trooper from Houston, last year
publicly voiced disappointment when he wasn't selected for the
Rangers.
   ``I'm happy for Mr. Young. This is a step in right direction for
him and his career. I'm disappointed for Michael Scott, because he
really is the person who brought all this to bear,'' said Gary
Bledsoe, president of the Austin NAACP branch.
   ``It appears there would be a policy in the department saying
we're going to start promoting a few people because we have to, but
we're going to promote people who don't complain or stand up for
their rights, people who play by the rules of the game,'' Bledsoe
said.
   Young and three white DPS officers will join the 94-man Rangers
unit in August and September, Wells said. Ranger candidates first
must pass a written test. High scorers then undergo an interview by
a board of six DPS supervisors.
   ``There's a certain mystique about the Texas Rangers. It's a
highly sought-after job in the department, and many people have to
apply many times _ most do _ before they're successful,'' said Col.
Leo Gossett, DPS director.
   Wells said the reason there hasn't been a black Ranger before is
that Young was the first black to reach the required level in the
testing. ``They're all treated the same on the testing procedures.
There's no difference,'' he said.
   While parts of the Rangers' history are sketchy, Young is
believed to be the first black to formally be included in the ranks.
   The Rangers trace their history to the days when Texas still
belonged to Mexico. Stephen F. Austin in 1823 employed 10 men to
serve as Rangers.
   ``The Texas Rangers may have been thought of as operating
against Indians and Mexican raiders in the early years and later
against outlaw bands, feudists, stock thieves and local rioters,''
says a history in the authoritative ``Handbook of Texas.''
   In 1935, the Rangers were reorganized and placed in the DPS and
now are stationed in towns across the state.

   New moves by the communist North and
capitalist South to ease their hostility and work out an agreement
on the Olympic Games are being viewed with great caution and little
hope.
   South Korea's National Assembly has accepted a proposal from
North Korea for inter-parliamentary talks on a non-aggression pact.
The North also agreed to discuss participating in the Olympics,
which would end a potential threat to the Games scheduled for
September in Seoul.
   Contacts would begin in August if terms can be worked out. The
South wants preliminary talks about an agenda but the North calls
that a waste of time.
   Some South Koreans hope for a breakthrough to peaceful relations
or reconciliation. One National Assembly spokesman said: ``Our
position is that we would try to accomodate the North's demand as
much as possible.''
   Hopes that talks could remove any North Korean threat to the
Olympics may be premature. The North has not dropped its key demand
to be co-host of the Olympics, holding some events on its
territory, and may hope to force concessions.
   A North Korean agreement to drop its co-hosting demand and take
part in the Olympics would be a stunning reversal of its position.
   North Korea may be initiating talks in order to disrupt the
Olympics by fostering uncertainty and tension up to opening day.
The talks could become another test of nerves in a contest that has
occupied the rival Koreas since the peninsula was divided at the
end of World War II.
   Past negotiations failed to ease tension. The last talks
collapsed in 1986 when the North pulled out in protest of routine
U.S.-South Korean military exercises.
   The Olympics are a pawn in the struggle for supremacy on the
peninsula and the North wants to be co-host in order to avoid
losing ground.
   Each side claims to be the nation's sole legitimate government.
They refuse to recognize each other and South Korea views the award
of the 24th Olympic Games games as world recognition of its
supremacy.
   The International Olympic Committee rejects the North's demand
to be co-host, saying the games are awarded to a single city and
cannot be shared.
   North Korea says the Olympics were awarded to the nation and the
two sides can work out a co-hosting agreement. It rejected a
compromise under which it could stage up to five of the sports if
it dropped the co-host demand.
   In proposing negotiations, the government in Pyongyang may be
seeking a face-saving reason for not participating in the games. It
could accuse the South of preventing a unified Olympics and claim
to have sought a solution until the last moment.
   South Korea agreed to the talks because of its desire to ease
tension and protect the Olympics from disruption or violence.
Officials in Seoul believe any kind of talks reduce the threat.
   Many terrorist actions against South Korea have been blamed on
the North. It was implicated in the Nov. 29 bombing of a South
Korean airliner, which killed all 115 people aboard.
   Olympic and South Korean officials acknowledge privately that
even a small border clash in the next few weeks could frighten away
participants and spectators. The border is less than 50 miles from
Seoul.
   Pyongyang has claimed South Korea and the United States are
using the Olympics to conceal preparations for a nuclear war, and
there are no signs that Kim Il Sung's regime has abandoned its
desire to reunite the peninsula under communist rule.
   Kim, who started the Korean War by invading the South in 1950,
said again Thursday that the Olympics threaten the North.
   ``The United States is reinforcing massive armed forces in and
around South Korea on the plea of guaranteeing `Olympic safety,'
and at the instigation of the United States the South Korean
authorities are maneuvering more blatantly than ever to keep our
nation divided forever,'' he declared.

   The cream of France's haute couture designers
showed off clothes that were both youthful and beautiful in the
fall-winter collection. The week of showings brought lots of good
news for fashion-watchers, including cheery colors to brighten up
winter.
   After the hue and cry about the miniskirt, hem lengths are
dropping somewhat, as designers realize that teeny skirts look
ridiculous in couture clothes.
   A few hemlines sank to mid-calf length at Chanel, Cardin,
Feraud, Givenchy. But most skirts came out hovering around the
kneecap or just above, and there was new attention to dressy pants.
   Marc Bohan at Dior on Thursday won the week's official award,
the Golden Thimble, for his youthful yet chic collection.
   Many who had seen the shows thought Yves Saint Laurent deserved
a prize for his superb collection of perfectly-executed clothes.
But Pierre Berge, president of Saint Laurent, has steadfastly
refused the Golden Thimble.
   Only a few thousand women worldwide can afford couture clothes,
which often cost $6,000 and range up to $25,000 for an elaborately
beaded evening gown.
   Besides pleasing these women, couturiers have another purpose in
turning out a collection. Couture clothes serve as models for good
ready-to-wear, and boost the designers' fame and name for the big
money stakes: accessory and perfume licenses.
   Suits made news in the shows, well shaped with waist emphasis
and enough shoulder padding to give jackets style without looking
hulky. Bohan's suits at Dior were based on short skirts and
snugly-fitted jackets with a martingale belt feature in back.
   Today's couturiers know that many of their best clients keep in
shape, have face-lifts and look young. So they don't have to worry
too much about the portly Mrs. Gotrocks types that cropped up 50
years ago or so, and their clothes are geared to slim women.
   Saint Laurent's easily-fitted piped suede suits came out in
glorious color combinations like turquoise and French blue,
shocking pink and raspberry, chartreuse and rust.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer's most artistic suede suits were the
ultimate in luxury. Many were painted with landscapes, others had a
cut-out eyelet effect.
   Trousers _ recently the domain of ready-to-wear _ made a strong
re-entry. Even Christian Lacroix gave up his little-girl bouffant
skirts to soften his general lines, which included some palazzo or
skirt-pants. The best appeared as a high-waisted ``tuxedo'' outfit
with a flowing back on the cutaway jacket.
   Saint Laurent's striking group of tuxedo styles, including
straight and uncomplicated pants, were a reminder that borrowing
menswear in the right way can make women look fabulous.
   Couture showed plenty of coats for keeping warm in pampered
comfort. The top furs, such as astrakhan, mink, sable and fox, were
often dyed everything from pastel to hot orange shades, a nice
extra fashion touch for the women who are bored with their plain
old natural sables or lynx.
   The broadcloth, cashmere or mohair coats were beautifully cut,
very fitted in long or short redingotes or princess coats,
seven-eighths shortie coats and full trapeze-line models.
   Late-day clothes looked rich and alluring, as couturiers let
their fantasies go wild. Plunging decolletes and strapless cocktail
or short evening gowns sometimes had elegant little boleros or
jackets for a discreet entrance to the party.
   The Renaissance and Tudor periods inspired some designers.
Lanvin's fur-trimmed taffeta gowns were striking enough for a film
set. Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel used page-boy velvet knickers or long
skirts, ruffed white collars and cuffs, chains and jewels in his
historical flights of fancy clothes.
   Couture's long gowns were stunning in iridescent taffeta, as
well as combinations of velvet and moire, lace and tulle. Satin
evening pajamas and dinner dresses were the options for informal
evenings.
   The colors on runways were lively enough to warm even the most
jaded fashion writer's heart. Many designers have fallen in love
with lavender and amethyst, using it both for day and evening.
   Besides silvery grey and autumn colors like pinky brick, rust,
forest green and raspberry, there was a lot of chocolate brown,
cafe au lait, and cinnamon.
   Designers didn't stop at regular fall colors. They also went
into sunny yellow, bright sapphire, poppy and carnation red,
emerald, blazing orange, electric pink, fuschia and cerise _
especially in late-day clothes.
   Even though the vast majority of women can't even contemplate
buying these couture clothes, they can serve as references for
style and color when looking through the racks. And those lucky
enough to afford the couturiers' ready-to-wear clothes, shown in
March and already on their way to the shops, might find cuts and
fabrics to echo couture quality.
   Just after the shows, American designer Patrick Kelly threw a
couture-and-gardenia party for the fashion crowd in his workshop in
the historical Marais district.
   Dressed in his favorite gear, baggy overalls and loud red
basketball shoes, Kelly was jovially pinning gardenias on the
women, and posing with live models and dummy mannequins wearing
``haute couture'' clothes he'd created, stitched charcoal grey
outfits and one striking green and black satin gown.
   ``I'd like to turn out a whole couture collection twice a year
and be accepted as a member of the Haute Couture branch of the
Chambre Syndicale,'' he said. ``But I was very glad to be accepted
into the French Federation of ready-to-wear creators.''

   A Navy operation to frighten away
doves that damaged engines and got in the way of planes at
Jacksonville Naval Air Station was such a success that it ended a
day early.
   Navy volunteers this week set off fireworks and fired guns to
frighten the flock of doves, and on Thursday spotted only four
doves in three hours.
   ``Those four were in the air. They were trying to get out of
town. I consider the bird program almost 100 percent successful,''
said W.J. Meyer, airfield manager.
   Fifteen volunteer bird hunters began working Tuesday and had
expected to be busy through Friday. Thirty to 35 birds were shot
this week, most of them on the ground, Meyer said.
   Birds began flocking to the runway July 22 after grass was mowed
and grass seeds dropped to the ground.
   A P-3 Orion had to abort a takeoff after birds damaged two of
its four engines. In addition, a bird flew into and damaged another
P-3 engine.

   A pipe bomb discovered in the county
courthouse was safely removed and detonated, police said Friday.
   The bomb was found Thursday night by a maintenance worker in a
basement restroom, St. Joseph County Sheriff Joseph Nagy said.
   Police sealed off the area around the building, and bomb
disposal experts removed the device using a remote-operated pulley.
The bomb was taken to an undisclosed location and detonated, police
said.
   No arrests have been made.

   Four young men boarded a bus at a
downtown stop early today and sprayed the vehicle with
semi-automatic gunfire, killing the driver and wounding four
passengers, police said.
   The gunmen, in their late teens and early 20s, fled on foot,
police said.
   The motive in the attack was not immediately known, but robbery
was ruled out, said Lt. Jim Hahn.
   Investigators were examining whether the attack was drug-related
retaliation against one of the passengers, or a revenge shooting
against the bus authority, Hahn said. At least a dozen shots were
fired, police said.
   ``As the bus passed the shop where I was working in the window I
heard _ Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! And Bang! _ six to 10 shots, and
then the bus stopped,'' said a 15-year-old girl who did not want to
be identified.
   She said she saw at least three people run from the bus, one of
whom collapsed on the ground holding his stomach. She said the
driver was slumped in his seat, with wounds to the head and torso.
   Driver Billy ``B.J.'' Givens, 43, died about an hour after he
was hit by gunfire several times, Hahn said.
   Passengers suffered wounds ranging from minor to critical, he
said. Details on their injuries were withheld.
   The bus line on which the attack occurred runs through one of
the city's poorest and most violence-plagued neigbhorhoods.
   Givens was a dapper man who had worked for the transit authority
for 20 years, receiving several citations for politeness and
helpfulness, awards determined by customer praise, said Mike Mills,
a spokesman for the agency.
   ``I think if one were to characterize the feeling here it would
be one of shock, of grief, of puzzlement, of why this sort of thing
would happen, and to this man,'' Mills said.

<HEAD>Study Finds More Violence Among Unmarried Couples Living Together</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Couples who live together are more likely
than married couples to be involved in violent conflicts, possibly
because married partners have a greater emotional investment in the
relationship, a study says.
   The study by University of New Hampshire professors Murray
Straus and Jan Stets found violence occurred among 35 percent of
the 237 cohabiting couples surveyed, 14 percent of the 5,005
married couples and 20 percent of the 526 dating couples.
   ``Every kind of intimate relationship has a risk of violence,''
Straus said Thursday.
   Cohabiting couples often are socially isolated, lacking the
network of relatives that many married couples rely on to help
resolve conflicts, he said. They also lack the material and
emotional investment of married couples, he said.
   Though both married and cohabiting couples may share a high
level of conflict from living together, a married couple is more
likely to shun violence to avoid risking the relationship and
losing the investment, he said.
   About two-thirds of the violence involved slapping, throwing
objects, pushing or shoving, he said. Some violent episodes were
more severe, involving kicking and punching.
   The findings will be presented to the American Sociological
Association conference Aug. 25 in Atlanta.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who
received two birthday cakes and 75 roses for his 75th birthday,
chatted Friday with his successor Yitzhak Shamir about everything
from Soviet-Israeli relations to recent Arab unrest.
   In a rare interview with Israel radio, the reclusive Begin, who
marks his birthday Saturday, said in a hoarse voice that he would
spend the day reading. ``Those who remember (my birthday) and want
to come _ come,'' he said.
   Begin's longtime aide Yehiel Kadashai said about 150 friends and
relatives of the former prime minister will visit his home at the
edge of the Jerusalem Forest on Saturday to offer birthday
greetings.
   Begin, who led his country to war in Lebanon and to peace with
Egypt, was once the fiery leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, now
led by Shamir.
   Today, the Nobel Prize winner rarely leaves his house and
entertains guests infrequently. But on Friday he met his successor
for 35 minutes.
   ``Mr. Begin is in a good mood and excellent health,'' Shamir
told reporters outside Begin's house. He said the two had spoken
``about everything, of course, including politics.''
   Shamir's aides said Shamir did not bring Begin a present. But
Jerusalem's Plaza Hotel brought in a huge round cake decorated with
the figure 75, and the city's King David hotel sent a heart-shaped
marzipan cake and a basket with 75 white and red roses.
   Passers-by stopped to look at the modest home, which is
protected by metal bars on the windows and guarded by a security
officer in a glass booth.
   ``I wish Begin (to live) until 120,'' a young woman named Geula
shouted in a popular Israeli expression.
   Shamir said he and Begin discussed the nearly 8-month-old
Palestinian rebellion in the Israeli-occupied territories, and that
the former leader ``thinks it will pass.''
   He said Begin was very pleased to hear about the first trip of
an Israeli diplomatic group to Moscow since 1967 and ``hopes to see
positive developments.''
   Shamir said the two men also discussed elections scheduled for
November, but he was not sure if Begin would use his popularity to
give Likud a boost in the campaign. ``It depends on him,'' Shamir
said.
   Begin's 45-year-old son, Benny, has been chosen by Likud to run
as a candidate for parliament in the Nov. 1 elections.
   Shamir added that he regularly confers with Begin about current
political affairs.
   Begin was elected prime minister in 1977. In 1978 he shared the
Nobel Peace Prize with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat for the
process leading to their historic peace treaty, signed the next
year.
   In 1982, Begin led Israel's invasion of Lebanon, beginning a
three-year war. He resigned in 1983, never publicly giving a reason.
   Aides said he was depressed by Israeli casualties in Lebanon and
the death in 1982 of his wife, Aliza.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
today denied that his peace talks with Iran and Iraq are in trouble
because of Iraq's insistence on a face-to-face meeting with its foe.
   The secretary-general scheduled a meeting later with the Iranian
foreign minister, but not with Iraq's envoy.
   ``Be patient,'' he told reporters. ``And we will make progress
rather soon ... I am constantly in touch with the parties. I keep
working.''
   Perez de Cuellar said he would speak to Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz of Iraq when he needs to see him.
   Aziz has not met Perez de Cuellar since their first two meetings
Wednesday, when Aziz stated that there could be no cease-fire in
the Iran-Iraq war without direct talks with Iran.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, has met the
secretary-general four times. Iran has rejected direct talks with
Iraq before a cease-fire.
   Perez de Cuellar said he set no deadline for the talks and would
work through the weekend.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have
said the talks are faltering over Iraq's insistence on direct talks.
   U.N. officials said a U.N. team of military experts would arrive
in Baghdad tonight to work out details for a cease-fire. The team
has been in Tehran.
   Iran and Iraq accused each other Thursday of blocking the U.N.
efforts to end their 8-year-old war.
   Perez de Cuellar acknowledged an impasse and, when asked if he
had a formula for breaking it, said: ``I'm working on that.'' But
he added, ``At some stage, direct talks are indispensable.''
   U.N. negotiations toward ending the war are being conducted
under Security Council Resolution 598, which Iraq agreed to soon
after it was adopted in July last year but which Iran did not
accept until this month.
   It provides for a cease-fire followed by withdrawal to
recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an
investigation of which side started the war.
   ``The policy of Iraq is to put obstacles in the way of the
secretary-general's peace efforts,'' said Mohammad Javad Zarif,
counselor at Iran's U.N. Mission. ``This whole Iraqi exercise is
planned to sabotage the efforts upon which the international
community is looking with hope.''
   Velayati accepted all of Perez de Cuellar's proposals on
implementing the peace plan. Iraq has not yet responded, and
details of the proposals have not been disclosed.
   Iraq's U.N. mission accused Iran of ``simply seeking a hasty
truce without giving any commitments that it will comply honestly
and sincerely to the full implementation of the resolution as a
plan for comprehensive and durable peace.''
   Both sides reported fighting Thursday at Eslamabad, 60 miles
inside Iran. Iraq, which says it has withdrawn from Iranian
territory, describes the invaders as Iranian rebels, but Iran says
they are Iraqi troops.
   In Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, Saadun Hamadi, the acting foreign
minister, summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent Security
Council members _ United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and
France _ and insisted on a peace treaty.
   ``This is the only way to secure a peaceful settlement'' of the
war, Iraqi television quoted him as saying.
   But he added that ``Iraq is for an early, immediate cease-fire
as a means to end the war within the framework of a comprehensive
peace settlement.''
   Pressure was increasing on Iraq in the 15-member Security
Council to drop its direct talks demand and other proposals that
could prolong the fighting, said U.N. diplomats who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Velayati and Aziz did not visit U.N. headquarters Thursday.
Perez de Cuellar suspended talks for a day to study his exchanges
with the Iraqi and Iranian envoys since Tuesday.
   Perez de Cuellar said he hoped Iranian officials ``are
reflecting on the possibility of having direct talks at some
stage,'' but said he cannot compel the two sides to do so if Iran
is unwilling.

   President Reagan today assured the families of
servicemen still missing from the Vietnam War that the government
must persevere in its attempt to give ``the fullest possible
accounting'' of their whereabouts.
   Addressing the National League of POW-MIA Families, Reagan
hailed an agreement in which Vietnam will allow a joint
U.S.-Vietnamese search for some 1,760 U.S. service personnel
officially listed as unaccounted-for.
   As Reagan spoke, a veterans group accused the administration of
lying about its intentions in the search for POWs and giving up on
live war prisoners still in Southeast Asia.
   The National Steering Committee for Vietnam War Veterans
announced plans to float Vietnamese currency down the Mekong River
stamped with a $2.4 million offer for the return of any live
American POW from Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia. The reward offer has
been made by several members of the House of Representatives and
others.
   Committee Chairman Ted Sampley of Kinston, N.C., said the group
plans to send a delegation to Thailand in October to distribute
stamped Vietnamese bills.
   Relatives of missing Americans floated balloons on the Mekong
carrying the reward offer last September after Thai officials
stopped their plans to launch the balloons into the air. U.S.
officials criticized the balloon launch plan, saying it might
hinder government efforts to gain an accounting of those missing.
   ``As you gather for your 19th meeting, the Vietnamese government
has once again raised our hopes for a breakthrough,'' the president
told the POW-MIA families. ``I welcome their pledge to my special
emissary (retired Army Gen. John Vessey) ... to accelerate their
work on those cases.''
   ``We look forward to its fulfillment,'' Reagan said, cautioning
that ``we have witnessed promises made in the past by Vietnam that
were not carried out. But we are following this offer up
aggressively.''
   In his speech today, Reagan announced that he was directing a
``comprehensive study'' on the issue of prisoners of war and
missing in action, and that the report would detail ``our efforts,
accomplishments and what remains to be done to achieve the fullest
possible accounting.''
   ``During the remainder of our administration, these efforts will
continue on a priority basis,'' he said. ``We must call upon the
next administration to do the same.''
   ``For you, the families of MIAs and POWs unaccounted for, the
Vietnam War is not over and will not end,'' Reagan said. ``For you,
the only way we can `give peace a chance' is to give you the truth:
the fullest possible accounting of your loved ones. ...
   ``If there are living Americans being held against their will,
we must bring them home,'' he said.
   ``Should there be anyone remaining voluntarily, their family
deserves to know,'' the president said. ``And every American who
has perished deserves to rest on U.S. soil. And until our questions
are fully answered, we will assume that some of our countrymen are
alive.''

   Strong winds scattered yachts racing in a regatta
in the Gulf of Riga, killing at least one sailor, the Tass news
agency reported Friday.
   Four yachts were reported missing.
   The state-run news agency said the yachts were racing from the
Estonian port of Parnu on the Baltic Sea to Riga, the Latvian
capital, when the storm broke out Thursday night.
   The yachts did not have radios and therefore could not be warned
a storm was on the way, Tass said.
   Three yachts returned to the Estonian port immediately, and 28
continued the race. By midday Friday, Tass said, four yachts were
missing and the body of a crewman of the ``Delfin'' washed ashore
along with wreckage from a yacht.
   Helicopters and ships were searching for the missing yachts,
Tass said.

<TEXT>
   Syndicated columnist Carl Rowan, a longtime
advocate of tougher handgun controls, will be arraigned Monday on
charges of using an unregistered handgun to shoot a teen-ager who
took an uninvited dip in his back yard pool.
   Rowan will be arraigned on two misdemeanor charges _ possession
of an unregistered gun and possession of unregistered ammunition _
in connection with the June 14 incident at his northwest Washington
home.
   He was charged Wednesday in District of Columbia Superior Court,
court records show.
   Beverly Burke, a spokeswoman for the district government's legal
division, confirmed today that city officials had decided a day
earlier to press the charges, each of which carries a maximum
penalty of a $1,000 fine and a year in jail.
   Rowan, 62, was cleared last month of assault charges in the
shooting incident after an investigation by the federal
prosecutor's office. But U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said at the
time that he believed Rowan should be prosecuted for possessing an
unregistered handgun.
   Stephens deferred that decision to the city, which normally
handles such cases.
   Rowan, who has frequently written columns calling for strict
restrictions on handgun use, refused to comment on the matter when
contacted by The Associated Press today in Reno, Nev.
   ``My lawyers are doing all the talking. I don't know all the
details yet,'' said Rowan, who was scheduled to speak before the
National Conference of State Legislatures.
   After the shooting incident, pro-gun groups said Rowan was being
hypocritical for owning a handgun after criticizing the practice
numerous times in his column. Rowan said he obtained the weapon
after receiving death threats.
   The district's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance requires that
all weapons be registered.
   But Rowan told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son,
Carl Jr., a former FBI agent, and that his son was told he did not
have to register the weapon after leaving the bureau.
   Rowan said the shooting occurred after he heard noises in his
back yard, called police, and then discovered Benjamin Smith, 18,
of Chevy Chase, Md., and three other youths by his pool.
   Rowan said he shot Smith after the teen-ager lunged at him.
Smith disputed that, saying he had not threatened the columnist and
had been shot while trying to flee.
   Smith, who was wounded in the wrist, was treated and released
the same day from Georgetown University Hospital. He was charged
with one count of unlawful entry, but prosecutors dropped the
misdemeanor charge in exchange for 40 hours of community service
work.

   The Red Flag, the hulking black limousine
preferred by China's top revolutionaries, will return to production
in 1989 after an eight-year suspension, the official People's Daily
reported Friday.
   The Changchun No. 1 Motor Vehicle Plant in northeast China is to
resume production of the CA770, one of three models of the Red Flag
produced at the plant between 1958 and 1980, the overseas edition
of the paper said.
   China produced 1,516 Red Flag limos in the past for use by
Chinese leaders such as Mao Tse-tung and visiting foreign
dignitaries.
   Some top leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, still use Red Flags,
although Mercedes Benz and Japanese luxury cars have generally
replaced the Red Flag as favored transportation for ranking Chinese.
   China's auto industry went into decline around the time the Red
Flag went out of production, but has recently shown signs of
revival following the imposition of high tariffs on imports.

<TEXT>
   President George Vassiliou of Cyprus, in the
United States on a 10-day visit, will appeal to President Reagan to
persuade Turkey to withdraw its troops and Turkish settlers from
the island.
   Cyprus has been divided since a Turkish invasion 14 years ago.
Vassilou proposed the demilitarization of the country and the
creation of a federalized republic.
   His schedule called first for a meeting late Friday with
Secretary of State George P. Shultz to be followed on Monday by a
30-minute meeting with Reagan and a separate session with Lt. Gen.
Colin Powell, the president's national security adviser.
   Vassilou will meet also with the Republican and Democratic
presidential aspirants, Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis, as well as congressional leaders.
   ``The United States can play a very important role in assisting
in the achievement of a settlement of the Cyprus problem ... not by
pressuring, but by persuading Turkey to withdraw its troops,''
Vassiliou said before his departure from Cyrpus.
   ``I will tell Mr. Reagan that the settlement of the Cyprus
problem is very simple. He is the greatest advocate of the
withdrawal of foreign troops and the full implementation of human
rights. I will tell him, I want only this, and nothing more.''
   Vassiliou added that a Cyprus settlement ``is to everyone's
benefit, including Turkey.''
   He said the continuation of the Turkish occupation of the
northern part of the east Mediterranean island poisons relations
between Greece and Turkey. The two NATO allies have approached the
brink of war in recent years because of long-standing differences
over Cyprus and oil-prospecting rights in the Aegean Sea.
   Vassiliou said violation of human rights in Cyprus by Turkey
caused by the occupation also were an obstacle to Turkey's
application for full membership in the European Economic Community.
   Vassiliou, the leader of the majority Greek Cypriot community on
the island, said ``the United States has every reason to want
progress on the Cyprus problem, and I believe that it will help
toward a Cyprus settlement.''

   President Reagan and former President Nixon
met for about an hour at the White House Thursday evening,
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater disclosed today.
   Fitzwater said Nixon came to the White House at Reagan's
invitation.
   ``I can't discuss the content of their conversations,'' he said.
   He said First Lady Nancy Reagan and White House Chief of Staff
Kenneth M. Duberstein also attended the meeting, held in the
residential quarters of the White House.
   Nixon was last at the White House for a meeting with the
president early last year.
   He also was at the White House in October 1981, along with
former Presidents Carter and Ford, when Reagan asked them to meet
with him before going to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's funeral
as his representatives.
   John Taylor, Nixon's spokesman at his office in New York, said
Nixon and Reagan also met at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York
in September 1984, just before a speech by Reagan at the United
Nations.
   Taylor said Duberstein called Nixon about 10 days ago to say he
would like to meet with him and to arrange a meeting. He said Nixon
and Duberstein met Thursday morning and then joined the president
and first lady for the late afternoon meeting.
   Leslye Arsht, deputy White House secretary, confirmed that
Duberstein met separately with the former president. She said the
meeting was held outside the White House.
   ``It was a private meeting, and we will have no further
comment,'' she said.
   Taylor said he did not know what was discussed at the meetings.

   Missouri voters decide Tuesday
whether to raise the jackpot limit on their struggling lottery and
whether to give former first lady Betty Hearnes a chance to be the
state's first female governor.
   In other primaries, Rep. Richard Gephardt, who filed at the last
minute for a seventh term after dropping his presidential bid,
faces three little-known Democrats. Several candidates from both
parties had entered the race for the 3rd District, which includes
part of St. Louis and its suburbs, but most of the Democrats bowed
out when Gephardt's plans changed.
   And Democratic farm activist Wayne Cryts will try to win his
party's nomination for the 8th District congressional seat. That
would entitle him to a rematch with Republican Rep. Bill Emerson,
who won by 8,000 out of 150,000 votes cast in 1986.
   In 1981, Cryts gained national attention by taking 32,000
bushels of his family's soybeans out of a grain elevator that went
into bankruptcy and was padlocked.
   Cryts is expected to easily knock off his three primary
opponents.
   Mrs. Hearnes, 61, who paints herself as a compassionate friend
of working Missourians, is considered the Democrats' best bet for
unseating Republican Gov. John Ashcroft.
   She's expected to face little trouble with her only primary
opposition, Lavoy ``Zaki'' Reed, a St. Louis area teacher who is
making his second bid for governor.
   ``Sure, lightning could strike and something could happen, but
the Democrats don't seem to have much of a primary fight,'' said
Todd Patterson, executive director of the Missouri Democratic
Party. ``I just can't imagine Betty and Wayne not winning.''
   Mrs. Hearnes' husband, Warren, served as governor during
1965-73. She was first elected to the state House in 1979. She has
the backing of party regulars and has already launched a television
campaign.
   Primary races have been overshadowed by campaigns for key
constitutional amendments that will be on the primary ballot.
   One would remove most spending restrictions on Missouri's
2{-year-old lottery, a change supporters call crucial in light of a
$24 million drop in sales during the last fiscal year. Officials
say the decline was probably caused by a lack of advertising.
   Current restrictions require that 45 percent of lottery proceeds
go for prizes, 45 percent to the state and 10 percent for
administrative costs, including advertising.
   Critics say the 45 percent prize limit does not allow the
lottery to compete with neighboring states with higher prize
structures. The amendment would change the prize limit to a minimum
of 45 percent, and lottery officials would like to give out about
50 percent in prizes. It would also permit the state to spend more
on advertising.
   Another constitutional change would reduce from two-thirds to
four-sevenths the vote majority needed to pass bond issues for
street and bridge repairs, schools and other facilities.
   Supporters say Missouri is one of only five states that require
the two-thirds majority, which they say unfairly limits school
districts and cities in their abililty to make improvements.
   In five of Missouri's six statewide offices up for election this
year, Republican incumbents, such as Ashcroft and Sen. John
Danforth, face no primary opposition.
   And although neither Danforth nor his Democratic challenger,
state Sen. Jay Nixon, face primary opposition, the race has turned
into one of the hottest of the summer as Nixon tries to chip away
at Danforth's support.
   One of the most crowded primary races is the shoot-out going on
in southwest Missouri's 7th District congressional district, where
four Republicans and three Democrats are running to replace
retiring Rep. Gene Taylor, a Republican.
   About 900,000 voters, or one-third of the state's registered
voters, are expected to go to the polls Tuesday.

   President Reagan said Thursday he will pass on
to his successor a program for ``the fullest possible accounting''
of servicemen still missing from the Vietnam war, acting on the
assumption that ``some of our countrymen are alive.''
   Addressing the National League of POW-MIA Families, Reagan also
called upon the government of Vietnam to move rapidly to determine
the fate of the 2,394 American servicemen still missing or
unaccounted for from the Southeast Asian conflict.
   He urged the Cambodian government to return the remains of
Americans that the Cambodians have said they are holding.
   Reagan said efforts to secure an accounting of the missing
``will continue on a priority basis'' during the less than six
months remaining in his administration.
   ``We must call upon the next administration to do the same,'' he
said. ``In preparation for transition, I am directing a
comprehensive study on the POW@MIA issue, detailing our efforts,
accomplishments, and what remains to be done to achieve the fullest
possible accounting.''
   He said the study would be made public.
   ``I implore the governments concerned to respond to our previous
proposals,'' Reagan said. ``Should there be anyone remaining
voluntarily, their family deserves to know. And every American who
has perished deserves to rest on U.S. soil. And until our questions
are fully answered, we will assume that some of our countrymen are
alive.''
   The United States lists 1,758 Americans as unaccounted for in
Vietnam, 547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and 6 in China.
   Reagan said the government in Hanoi ``has once again raised our
hopes for a breakthrough'' by agreeing to a joint U.S.-Vietnamese
search for some of those missing in Vietnam.
   ``We have witnessed promises made in the past by Vietnam that
were not carried out, but we are following up this offer
aggressively,'' he said. ``We look forward to its fulfillment.''
   The president also took note of Vietnam's recent announcement of
plans to withdraw its forces from Cambodia.
   ``If they are serious, then it is time to move rapidly to
resolve the POW-MIA issue; for the deep pain that this issue brings
to the American people will turn against Hanoi if it lingers past a
Cambodian settlement,'' he said.
   ``It is in the interests of Hanoi to position itself for a new
era and to help bring this to pass.''
   As for Cambodia, he said, ``The government in Phnom Penh has
announced they are holding the remains of Americans but have yet to
agree to our proposals to receive them. I call upon them today to
do so.''
   As Reagan finished his speech, a woman in the audience called
out, ``Don't abandon them; please don't abandon them.''
   In the hotel lobby and outside, demonstrators wearing badges
identifying themselves as members of the ``Forget Me Not
Association,'' shouted ``Freedom Now'' and demanded stepped-up
action to find the missing.
   At the National Press Club Building, the National Steering
Committee for Vietnam War Veterans announced plans to float
Vietnamese currency down the Mekong River stamped with a $2.4
million offer for the return of any live American POW from Vietnam,
Laos or Cambodia. The reward offer has been made by several members
of the House of Representatives and others.
   Committee chairman Ted Sampley of Kinston, N.C., said the group
plans to send a delegation to Thailand in October for distribution
of stamped Vietnamese 200 and 500 ``dong'' bills. He said 20
million dong would be distributed, worth between $5,000 and $8,000.
   Relatives of missing Americans floated balloons on the Mekong
carrying the same reward offer last September after Thai officials
stopped their plans to launch the balloons into the air. U.S.
officials criticized the balloon launch plan, saying it might
hinder government efforts to gain an accounting of those missing.

   The bullet-tattered carcass of a
1,000-pound leatherback turtle, spanning seven feet, has washed
ashore, officials said.
   The female turtle was shot in the back six to eight times,
lifeguard Stuart Fraser said after the turtle was found Thursday
morning at Victoria Beach.
   John Cunningham, a former lifeguard and director of Friends of
the Sea Lion, said a representative from the National Marine
Fisheries, the federal agency responsible for marine life, will
participate in a necropsy Friday.
   The turtle was at least 70 years old, Cunningham said. It is
breeding season for the turtles, but it was unknown if she was
bearing eggs.
   The turtle had been dead about two days, he said.
   Friends of the Sea Lion is a non-profit, educational
organization that runs a rehabilitation center for injured marine
animals. It usually takes care of seals and sea lions.

<TEXT>
   The peasant woman crouched in
the lamplight and whispered bitter tales of sheltering her sons
from Sandinista army recruiters and heeding the demands of the
anti-government rebels.
   She said she wants to survive in this remote southern mountain
village, where soldiers from both camps in Nicaragua's six-year
civil war pass through the steep paths, leaving their mark upon the
lives of the peasants.
   ``We have to get along with both sides just to be able to
live,'' the woman said. She and a dozen relatives gathered around a
homemade kerosene lamp in her two-room wooden house.
   ``We try to avoid both, even though the Contras in these parts
don't recruit by force, but the Sandinistas do,'' she said.
   The woman, her relatives and neighbors spoke over the course of
two days to a reporter visiting this rugged village, 185 miles
southeast of Managua. Casa de Tabla is accessible only by foot or
horse along steep hills and narrow paths knee-high in mud most of
the year.
   They told their stories on the condition their names not be used
for fear of revenge by the leftist Sandinistas or the rebels, known
as Contras.
   The Soviet-supplied Sandinista troops and the U.S.-supported
rebels agreed to suspend military operations four months ago.
Residents say the recruitment continues and the fighting has grown
less frequent but has not stopped.
   The 49-year-old woman knows the effects of vengeance first-hand.
Contras killed her husband and eldest son. Sandinista rockets
struck her home, killing her cousin and injuring four of her
children.
   The poor peasants in Casa de Tabla, like many others in isolated
battle zones, express their helplessness at being caught between
two armies. Their allegiance lies with the latest group trudging
through carrying guns.
   The residents of the village said they don't sympathize with
either side. They just want to be left alone.
   The Contras from the southern front dominate the area and have
major base camps nearby. The government doesn't. That means the
rebels are known in the village, while the Sandinista soldiers are
strangers.
   The Contras pass through, demanding civilian support, which
usually means feeding passing troops.
   ``If someone comes to my house with a rifle and asks for coffee,
can I say no? Of course not,'' one resident said. ``You see what
happens to us, peasants who just want to work. If we give our moral
support to the Sandinistas the others would cut our throats and
vice versa.''
   The Contras garner some favor by not pressing the youths into
their ranks, but they exact a high price for locals who don the
Sandinista uniform or appear to aid the leftist government.
   ``My husband was killed by the Contras in 1984. They slashed his
throat and tossed the body in the river,'' the woman recounted, her
voice hushed and calm. ``They said he was with the Sandinistas.''
   Contras killed her oldest son a year earlier because he was
serving the government's mandatory military service, she said.
   Three of her adult sons, aged 23 to 28, spend much of their time
hiding from passing government troops. They constructed a trench by
the riverbank for the men to escape from Sandinista recruitment and
for the family to flee during battles between the warring factions.
   ``I'm off,'' the 25-year-old son said. ``I move like a snake in
the mountains when the Sandinistas come.''
   His mother said several of the local boys forced into military
service left the government ranks with their weapons and joined the
Contras or turned their arms over to the rebels.
   On a recent night, after the family had gone to sleep, a young
man called at the latched door. He wore the camouflage uniform of
the Sandinista army and carried a government-issued AK-47 assault
rifle.
   He had gone a day earlier into the closest small city, Verdun,
and was recruited by the Sandinistas. He, like many others before
him, fled.
   ``Now he has to decide if he'll join the Contras or just turn
over his rifle,'' one of the sons said.
   His mother rails against the Sandinistas, whom she frequently
refers to as communists, and the Contras, who she says ``come and
take everything without paying a penny.''
   The woman heeds the Contra demands and feeds the troops. In
retaliation, she said, a Sandinista helicopter fired rockets into
her home in September during a government offensive to roust rebels
from the surrounding hills.
   ``They knew what they were doing,'' she said, pointing to where
the rockets crashed through the wooden roof into the kitchen.
``They said we were Contras because we gave them food. And if you
speak against the Sandinistas they put you in jail.''

   Police arrested a Japanese man on
Friday after he ripped up Philippine currency in front of customs
officials.
   Chiaki Uneoka, 37, who was preparing to leave for Tokyo, tore up
1,320 pesos ($65) after learning that departing tourists are only
allowed to bring 500 pesos ($25) out of the country, said customs
officer Clarita Balite.
   The government news agency said Uneoka was charged with
violating a Central Bank circular prohibiting the mutilation of
Philippine currency.
   Under Philippine law, a person can be fined 20,000 pesos
($1,000) or imprisoned for five years if convicted of mutilating or

<HEAD>Laboratory Studies Suggest Immune Cells May Block Diabetes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies in diabetic mice suggest that a
drug that stimulates the immune system may stop the destruction of
insulin-producing cells and thus prevent diabetes, a researcher
said Friday.
   Stress and viral infections also have been found to affect the
development of diabetes, said Edward Leiter, a geneticist at The
Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor.
   Leiter said he and his colleagues had expected that an
immune-stimulating drug would make diabetes worse in the mice they
studied. Instead, it apparently brought the diabetes under control.
   The form of diabetes that requires insulin injections is thought
to occur when the body's immune system attacks its own
insuling-producing cells, or beta cells, in the pancreas, Leiter
explained.
   The drug, a substance called interleukin-2 that occurs normally
in the body in small amounts, activates the immune system cells and
thus should have accelerated the destruction of beta cells, Leiter
said.
   It appears, however, that the drug activated some kind of immune
cell that has the normal function of preventing the body's defenses
from attacking the body itself. In the mice, it blocked the
destruction of beta cells.
   This finding _ in mice specially bred to have diabetes _ may not
hold any immediate importance for humans, but it does shed light on
the basic processes underlying the development of diabetes, Leiter
said. Mice and humans share many genes and a variety of diseases.
   Leiter has determined that in the mice he studied, a strain
called non-obese diabetic or NOD, at least three separate genes
seem related to the development of diabetes.
   He has also found that stress appears to aggravate the
development of diabetes, which occurs only in the males of that
mouse strain.
   Mice that were kept in standard, crowded cages with other males
and were subjected to the stress of having blood and urine samples
taken periodically have about a 50 percent chance of developing
diabetes.
   In contrast, individual male mice left alone in a cage with a
female for breeding developed diabetes at about half that rate,
Leiter said.
   Leiter's work is among many recent studies that are helping to
clarify the role of the immune system in diabetes, he said.
   For example, Michael B.A. Oldstone of the Scripps Clinic in La
Jolla, Calif., recently found that infection with a virus could
block the destruction of beta cells in NOD mice.
   Leiter said viral infections stimulate the production of
interleukin-2. Oldstone's infected mice might have produced more
interleukin-2 and that might be the reason their diabetes was
brought under control, Leiter said.
   And Japanese researchers have found that NOD mice develop
diabetes at a higher rate when raised in a completely germ-free
environment.
   It is as if the immune system, freed from the responsibility of
preventing infection, becomes ``introspective,'' looking for things
in the body to attack, Leiter said.

<TEXT>
   Harold R. Harris, an aviation pioneer and
airline executive who claimed to be the first person to save his
own life with a free-fall parachute, has died at the age of 92.
   Harris, who rose to the presidency of Northwest Airlines, died
at home Thursday.
   He began his aviation career in 1917 in the Army Signal Corps,
which sent him to test Caproni bombers in Italy.
   His live-saving use of a free-fall parachute, activated by the
user rather than by a static line on the plane, occurred Oct. 20,
1922, while he worked as a test pilot. He said he had to jump when
the experimental plane he was flying over Dayton, Ohio, began
breaking up.
   ``I pulled the parachute release ring, or what I thought was the
release ring ... found I was falling with my head down, my feet
pointing to the sky and my body rotating,'' Harris said in a 1987
interview.
   ``I pulled the release ring and the parachute promptly turned me
rightside up. I remember looking at the parachute and wondering how
such a great expanse of white silk could be so clean, even though
it had plenty of opportunity to be soiled in a dirty hangar.''
   He landed on brick pavement under a grape arbor near McCook
Field, where the flight had begun.
   Harris also flew as a cropduster in the Midwest and Latin
America, and helped set up the Peruvian Airways Corp., the first
U.S. flag airline south of the equator.
   In 1942, he returned to military service to help organize the
Air Transport Command. He retired from the Air Force in 1945 as a
brigadier general.
   In the next two decades, Harris was vice president of American
Overseas Airlines, Atlantic Division vice president of Pan American
World Airways, president of Northwest Airlines and president of
Aviation Financial Services. He retired in 1965.
   He is survived by a son, a daughter and four grandchildren.
   A memorial service is planned Sunday in Falmouth.

<HEAD>Hodel Says Wilderness Areas Have No Implied Rights to Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, proclaiming a
major victory for water users in the West, said today the Reagan
administration has taken the position that wilderness areas have no
implied rights to water.
   Hodel told a news conference that Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III has
concurred with the department solicitor's legal opinion that
Congress must specifically award water when it creates a wilderness
area.
   Hodel noted that there are conflicting U.S. District Court
opinions taking opposite sides of a major question in the arid
West: without a specific statement by Congress, is a wilderness
area guaranteed the water it needs for proper management?
   ``The current administration feels threatened in the West
because of the all-out offensive by (Democratic presidential
nominee) Michael Dukakis,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., who sat
in the audience at the news conference, which he said simply
reiterated policy the administration has been following.
   The action runs counter to a U.S. District Court ruling in
Colorado in 1985 and to a 1979 ruling by an Interior Department
solicitor during the Carter administration, said Maggie Fox of the
Sierra Club.
   ``This marks a new low in Meese's and Hodel's flagrant disregard
for the law,'' she said. ``I am surprised that they could find an
attorney willing to sign his name to the document.''
   Hodel said the administration was coming down on the side of a
recent ruling in New Mexico that there are no water guarantees
unless Congress writes them into wilderness legislation.
   Congress has been skirting the issue in wilderness bills,
remaining silent on water rights and leaving the question up to the
Interior and Agriculture departments and court rulings.
   Hodel noted that very frequently, ``in order to get this water
(for wilderness), you have to take it away from someone else.''
   He said that under the policy, the administration would not go
to court to argue that wilderness areas have implied water rights.
   In a letter to Hodel, Meese said that without directives from
Congress, the government will handle water needs of wilderness
areas under the various state mechanisms that apportion water among
often-competing users.
   Hodel said the policy has ``the distinct possibility'' of
extending beyond the current administration because ``there would
be a substantial burden of proof on a new attorney general to sweep
this aside.''
   ``This is a major victory for the western states, water users
and the principles of federalism,'' said Hodel, flanked by a group
of Republican lawmakers from the West.
   ``Congress did not intend to reserve federal water rights for
wilderness purposes when it created the national wilderness
preservation system in 1964,'' he said.
   Hodel said the rights of existing water users, including federal
forests, parks and wilderness areas and Indian tribes, would be
protected.

   British actress Margaret Tyzack, best known to
American audiences as the evil ``Cousin Bette'' on public
television's ``Masterpiece Theater,'' will be allowed to appear
with Maggie Smith in ``Lettice and Lovage,'' when it arrives on
Broadway in January.
   Actors Equity, the American actors union, has agreed to let Miss
Tyzack perform in New York, recreating the role she plays in the
London production of Peter Shaffer's play. In the hit comedy, Miss
Smith is an eccentric English tour guide and Miss Tyzack is her
employer.
   Equity usually grants permission only for stars of international
caliber to work in New York, saying other role should be filled by
Americans. Miss Smith reportedly would not consider an American
engagement unless Miss Tyzack also appeared in the Broadway
version, which will directed by Michael Blakemore.

30,'' Montand said. ``But I believe the moment of truth will be at
the birth. Perhaps I will wake up suddenly and find myself in the
skin of a young and completely doting father.''
   Montand told the daily Nice Matin that Carole Amiel, 28, is
expecting his child in November or December.
   ``To be frank, I had not considered raising a baby now,'' he
said. ``Carole made a choice that was not mine, but it is incumbent
on me to respect a decision that is profoundly respectable.''
   Montand, who was married for nearly 40 years to actress Simone
Signoret, said the couple had been disappointed at their inability
to have a child. Ms. Signoret had a daughter from a previous
marriage, and Montand adopted her.
   The baby with Ms. Amiel will be his first.

   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva says
he doesn't mind earning about the same money as the chauffeurs of
most other European premiers.
   But he's not sure university rectors and the directors of public
companies should earn more.
   Cavaco Silva was defending salary increases of 12 percent to 36
percent for deputies, ministers and other elected officials
recently approved in parliament by his Social Democrat Party.
   Other state employees in Portugal have had to remain content
with wage increases of 6.5 percent this year.
   The prime minister said Friday that Portuguese government
officials earned far less than their counterparts in the rest of
Europe, comparing his salary to that of other premiers' chauffeurs.

<HEAD>Diplomats Say Foreign Missions Sending Staff Home From Kabul</HEAD>

   Several countries have begun calling
their diplomats home from Kabul after a barrage of guerrilla rocket
attacks on the Afghan capital, Western diplomats said Friday.
   Within one week in mid-July, as many as 200 rockets blasted
Kabul.
   A rocket smashed into a wing of the French Embassy on Saturday,
damaging the ambassador's residence but causing no injuries.
Another rocket landed near the U.S. Embassy compound, blowing out
windows in a nearby apartment building and the Radio Afghanistan
complex, the diplomats said.
   Earlier this month, a rocket hit a club that is a gathering spot
for diplomats, and one person was injured.
   Western diplomats said most foreign missions have already sent
dependents home while others are planning to soon. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, Charles E. Redman, the State Department
spokesman, said he did not know of any damage to the U.S. Embassy
in recent days. He declined to say how many U.S. officials were
assigned to Kabul.
   ``I don't know of any plans to change our presence,'' he said.
   The thinning out of foreign personnel in Kabul has been a
two-phased exercise, said diplomatic sources, with the Eastern
European missions making the first move. Most senior personnel at
these missions left the Afghan capital under the pretext of
``vacations,'' said diplomats.
   ``Very junior personnel'' now head most East European missions,
they said.
   The diplomats continued to emphasize the increased role of
Soviet forces in the defense of Kabul. After a year's absence,
Soviet armor has been redeployed to the west of the city in the
Lake Kargha and Paghman area.
   Western diplomats said the government's control of the key
district town of Paghman, nine miles west of the capital, is in
jeopardy.
   Earlier reports claimed 4,000 Afghan guerrillas massed around
Paghman, and diplomats said Soviet and Afghan army troops as well
as officers with the Afghan secret service, Khad, and army commando
units moved into the Paghman plain to reinforce embattled
government troops.
   The growing involvement of Soviet forces in the defense of the
capital has increased speculation about the Afghan government's
chances of survival once the Soviet troop pullout is completed.
   An April 14 accord negotiated by the United Nations provided for
the phased withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Half of
the estimated 100,000 troops are to be out by Aug. 15 and the
remainder by Feb. 15.
   Soviet troops and tanks moved into Afghanistan in December 1979
to prop up the struggling communist government.
   The diplomats also said Soviet forces backing Afghanistan's
Marxist government are now fully responsible for defense of Kabul
airport, which is a consistent target of rocket attacks by Afghan
guerrillas.

   Arabs in the occupied territories staged a
near-total commercial strike Friday in a show of solidarity with
Arab women held in Israeli jails. Three Arabs were reported wounded
in clashes in the Gaza Strip.
   An extremist faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization
called on residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to reject
negotiations with Israel.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine put out a
leaflet calling dialogue with Israel an illusion. It criticized PLO
spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif, who recently advocated
Palestinian-Israeli talks under the auspices of an international
conference.
   ``At the same time your uprising is getting better and better,
some in the field are going back to their old tactics and trying
the way of dialogue and negotiations,'' said the leaflet, which was
distributed in Arab east Jerusalem. ``These are nothing but
illusions.''
   In another development, Palestinian leaders were divided in
their reactions to Jordan's decision on Thursday to cancel a $1.3
billion development fund for the occupied territories.
   Pro-Jordanian figures who favor continued Jordanian involvement
in the territories said the cancellation would increase hardships
for Palestinians, who have already suffered considerably during the
uprising.
   Deposed Gaza City Mayor Rashad Shawaa, alligned with Jordan,
said the move was ``regrettable because people here need help, and
this was an important source of help.'' But pro-PLO figures did not
oppose the move, which was seen as an effort by Hussein to
disengage himself from leadership in Palestinian affairs and give
the PLO more responsibility.
   ``The Amman decision will not affect anybody,'' said Mustafa
Natsche, deposed mayor of the West Bank city of Hebron and a PLO
supporter. He said that although Palestinians need aid from all
Arab countries, they mostly need to remain steadfast in their
opposition to Israeli rule.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   Observation of Friday's general strike on behalf of female
prisoners was almost complete, a reflection of the continued
influence wielded by underground Palestinian leaders.
   Neither Israeli nor Palestinian sources were able to provide a
current figure for the number of women jailed since the uprising
began last Dec. 8. About 5,800 Arabs have been detained, according
to last month's military figures, but the overwhelming majority are
men.
   Protests occurred Friday in the Shati refugee camp in the
seaside Gaza Strip, a military spokesman said. He said he did not
know if troops fired on demonstrators, but a local reporter said
three men in their 20s were brought to Gaza City's Ahli Hospital
with bullet wounds in their legs. Since the uprising began 235
Palestinians and four Israelis have died.
   The army also demolished homes belonging to three Gazans
suspected of instigating anti-Israeli protests, the Itim news
agency said Friday. The demolitions took place Thursday in the
Nusseirat refugee camp.
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, the only movement was of
children selling newspapers door to door, residents said. Central
roads were blocked with rocks and burning tires and outlawed
Palestinian flags hung from an electricity pole.
   In Bethlehem, also on the West Bank, Palestinian activists
poured oil on the streets to prevent workers from going to jobs in
Israel. On a wall, someone had written in red spray paint: ``Death
to the Zionists.''
   Streets of Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, and the
occupied Gaza Strip were deserted except for soldiers and military
jeeps, reporters said.
   Weekly Moslem prayers passed without incident. The general
strike prevented many worshipers from reaching Jerusalem's Al Aqsa
mosque, where 300 policemen were on alert for possible violence.

   The Security Council on Friday unanimously
condemned the kidnapping of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, a U.N. military observer in Lebanon, but did not mention
his pro-Iranian abductors.
   The resolution, adopted by a 15-0 vote, also demanded Higgins'
immediate release and called upon U.N. members ``to use their
influence in any way possible to promote implementation'' of its
appeal for freedom.
   Higgins was abducted Feb. 17 by a previously unknown group
calling itself the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades. He is one of
nine Americans and nine other foreigners held captive by
pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.
   Earlier Friday, Higgins' wife, Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, met
with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. ``I am making a
constant effort to obtain his release,'' he told her. Mrs. Higgins
did not speak to reporters.
   The secretary-general has raised the issue of the 18 hostages
during talks this week with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati. The U.N. chief has appealed to Iran to use its influence
with the Islamic fundamentalist captors loyal to Iran to gain their
release.
   An Iranian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, later
told a reporter that there had been no response from Tehran to the
secretary-general's plea for Higgins' release.
   ``I want to express my concern to you,'' Perez de Cuellar told
Mrs. Higgins when she met him in his office. Higgins, of Danville,
Ky., was chief of a U.N. military observer group when he was
abducted. The Vietnam veteran also served as an aide to former
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
   Perez de Cuellar has met with relatives of other hostages as
well.
   The council's brief resolution said the council already has
``condemned unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking and
abduction'' and called for the release of all hostages ``wherever
and by whomever they are being held.''
   Iran said Thursday it was concentrating on ending its war with
Iraq and had no plans to meet with former Democratic presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson about freeing the American hostages.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati said that Velayati
``doesn't have a mandate to embark on anything other than
implementation of the Security Council Resolution 598,'' which
calls for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Velayati and Iraq's foreign minister are in New York to discuss
with Perez de Cuellar efforts to bring about a cease-fire.
   Mahallati said Velayati would ``indeed not'' see Jackson, who
said he wanted such a meeting to seek the release of the U.S.
hostages.
   This week's peace talks raised hopes for gaining the release of
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   In Beirut today, the weekly mazagine Ash-Shiraa reported that
negotiations are under way to free the hostages. It quoted an
unidentified informed security source as saying that high-level
contacts were under way between officials of the hostages' nations
and a state with ``direct influence on the hostages.''
   The magazine gained international fame when it broke the story
of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for the release of
hostages in 1986. But most of its recent reports on the hostages
have not proved accurate.
   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. Anderson, 40, was abducted
in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Higgins, 43, is chief of the U.N. Troop Supervision
Organization, a military observer group in the Middle East.
   On Thursday, Jackson telephoned Perez de Cuellar about the
hostages and asked him to convey a message to Velayati, U.N.
officials said. They said the secretary-general did so. But
Mahallati said his mission had not received a communication from
Perez de Cuellar.
   Iran has said it could intercede to obtain the hostages' freedom
if the United States agreed to release Iranian assets frozen in the
United States.
   The United States has said it is willing to discuss the issue
but has rejected any deal or payment of ransom.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Nixon returned to the White
House this week to meet with President and Mrs. Reagan and Chief of
Staff Kenneth M. Duberstein, it was announced Friday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater the four met for about
an hour Thursday evening in the White House residential quarters.
He said the meeting was requested by Reagan.
   ``I can't discuss the content of their conversations,'' he said.
   John Taylor, Nixon's spokesman in New York, said Duberstein
telephoned Nixon about 10 days ago to say that he would like to
meet with him and to arrange a meeting with Reagan.
   He said Nixon met with Duberstein on Thursday morning in
addition to the later meeting with the president and first lady. He
said he did not know what was discussed.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Leslye Arsht said the
Nixon-Duberstein meeting was held outside the White House.
   ``It was a private meeting, and we won't have any further
comment,'' she said.
   Nixon was last at the White House for a meeting with the
president early last year.
   ``The two presidents have had private visits on a number of
occasions,'' Fitzwater said.
   Nixon was at the White House in October 1981, along with former
presidents Carter and Ford, after Reagan asked them to represent
him at Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's funeral.
   Taylor said Nixon and Reagan also met at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel in New York in September 1984, just before a speech by Reagan
at the United Nations.
   The two men attended the funeral of former CIA Director William
J. Casey in New York on May 9, 1987.

   George Bush talked of secrets, both political
and playful, as he continued his quiet search for a running mate
and bantered with kids at a day-care center Friday.
   Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee, also took a
swipe at Michael Dukakis, saying the Democratic nominee has
suggested that ideology doesn't matter. Such talk ``just masks over
his far-left philosophy,'' Bush said.
   He toured the child-care center in suburban Tyson's Corner, Va.,
bringing attention to his $2.2 billion proposal that would provide
tax credits for relatively low-income families with children.
   While there, he played catch with children, pushed several
toddlers on a tire swing and helped put tropical fish in a fish
tank.
   ``When you put a fish in, don't ever hold it by the hand,'' Bush
said. He joked that he was special because ``I can talk to fish.''
   One child asked him, ``Are you really going to get to be
president?''
   ``It's a secret _ don't tell the others,'' the vice president
responded.
   He said little about the last real question lingering before the
Republican National Convention: whom he will choose as his vice
presidential running mate.
   Bush told reporters he thinks too much attention is being given
to the matter, since ``I really believe the election will be
decided at the presidential level.''
   He has already contacted more than 12 possible contenders for
the spot, according to aides. Asked whether he planned to call
additional prospects, Bush said, ``Probably.''
   ``We're going through some mandatory investigations,'' he said.
``I will make the selection in my own mind before I go down to New
Orleans'' for the Aug. 15-18 convention. In the meantime, he said,
``I will keep my own counsel.''
   Bush has said he does not plan to announce his choice until the
convention.
   Those already contacted by Bush include former
presidential-campaign rivals Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Rep. Jack
Kemp of New York, Dole's wife, former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, and several people whose names did not figure in
earlier speculation, including Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., also has said he has been asked
to submit background information.
   Bush has now talked with nearly everyone on his ``long list'' of
vice presidential candidates, aides said.
   Campaign sources said the list to date also includes Sens. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo.; William L. Armstrong, R-Colo.; John Danforth,
R-Mo. and Nancy L. Kassebaum, R-Kan.; Govs. Thomas H. Kean of New
Jersey, John Sununu of New Hampshire, Carroll A. Campbell of South
Carolina, George Deukmejian of California, and former Govs. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee and Richard Thornburgh of Pennsylvania, who
recently was nominated by President Reagan to be attorney general.
   Bush has said he hoped to have a tentative list completed by
week's end.
   As for child care, Bush, who has proposed a $1,000-per-child tax
credit primarily aimed at low-income working mothers, voiced
opposition Friday to a $2.5 billion Democratic child care plan that
would give the federal government a more direct role.
   ``I am absolutely convinced the problem is so big and so diverse
that the federal government alone cannot have a bricks-and-mortar
child care program that's going to be effective,'' Bush said.
   ``You have to have choice, parental choice, family choice, and
you have to have diversity,'' he said.

<HEAD>TV Serialization of Hindu Epic to End Amid Protests</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An 18-month-long religious experience
will end for millions of Indians when a TV serialization of a Hindu
epic goes off the air despite protests that reached all the way to
India's Parliament.
   The series ``Ramayana,'' which depicts the trials and
tribulations of the mythical warrior-god Rama, has been the most
popular program ever on government-run Indian television. It is set
to go off the air Sunday.
   The weekly half-hour show has become a ritual for up to 100
million viewers, who often watch on communal TV sets in small
villages. In the eastern city of Cuttack, conch shells are blown
and incense sticks lit to herald the Sunday morning broadcast in
classic Hindu fashion.
   The show has raised controversy _ especially when its lead actor
got involved in politics _ and spawned an industry in videotapes,
comic books and toy imitations of the maces, bows and arrows used
by Rama to conquer various demons.
   In three cities, garbage workers have gone on strike to demand
the program be continued to include the traditional ending of the
2,600-year-old epic.
   In Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab state, a case is pending in
court after a garbage collectors' union filed suit to plead for the
show to continue. Union official Karam Chand Pardesi testified that
ending the epic now would distort the image of Rama, who is an
incarnation of the major Hindu god Vishnu.
   Many viewers feel the same way.
   Baldev Raj, a New Delhi scooter-rickshaw driver, told a
passenger recently: ``I've read the book. There's more to come.''
   Officials of Doordashan, the government television, insist the
show will end Sunday with Rama's coronation as king after 14 years
in exile. After all, they say, the program already was extended
once from a 52-week run to 78 weeks.
   But political pressure is beginning to take its toll. After the
public protests were raised Friday in Parliament, Broadcasting
Minister H.K.L. Bhagat said the government was considering whether
to extend the story to its end.
   In traditional form, the story goes on to tell of the banishment
of Rama's wife Sita when she is suspected of infidelity, the birth
of her twins Luv and Kush, and Sita's being swallowed up by the
earth as the youngsters are reunited with Rama.
   The retelling of the old Hindu tale with its colorful costumes
and vibrant action holds great appeal for the 80 percent of India's
800 million citizens who are Hindus.
   The serial is also ideally slotted at 9:30 a.m. Sunday, just in
time for Hindus to watch the gods on TV after the ritual morning
bath and prayers.
   But the magazine Illustrated Weekly of India, in a cover article
titled ``Goodbye Rama,'' said the serial also resolved an identity
crisis for Hindus after years of ``smouldering at the shibboleths
of secularism.''
   In officially secular India, the magazine said, the serial
revived ``their spirits, breaking them into a disturbing rash of
religious, almost reactionary, fervor.''
   Secularists were angered when actor Arun Govil, who plays Rama,
appeared in saffron robes and urged voters to follow ``the way of
the lord'' and vote for his man in a parliamentary campaign.
   The candidate lost, but that did nothing to lessen the show's
popularity. In the northern state of Kashmir, riots broke out when
a power breakdown interrupted the weekly broadcast.
   Fans need not worry about missing the well-known ending of the
Hindu tale even if show goes off the air.
   Producer Ramanand Sagar is now shooting the rest of the epic for
sale and rental as video cassettes, an associate said.
   The weekly magazine India Today estimated income from videos of
previous episodes at $10.7 million.
   ``For the commercially-oriented, all the serial's viewers are
sitting ducks,'' it said. ``An entire industry of epic memorabilia
survives on their addiction.''
   One enterprising businessman has even started a ``Hanoomates
Club'' for children _ based on Hanuman, Rama's monkey-king ally _
that India Today says could produce $2.85 million in sales of
comics and cartoon films.
   For those fans who cannot afford such extras, India's government
television is offering another attraction.
   It will begin serializing another Hindu epic _ the Mahabharata,
one of the world's longest poems at 18 volumes.

   Pakistan's foreign minister said Friday that
Aug. 15 will be ``the critical date'' in judging whether the Soviet
Union is meeting its commitment to withdraw military forces from
Afghanistan.
   ``We need to withhold final judgment on the withdrawals until
that date,'' Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan told reporters.
   The Soviet Union, in an agreement signed in Geneva, committed to
withdrawing half its force of more than 110,000 by Aug. 15.
   ``Our hope is that this in fact will materialize,'' Yaqub Khan
said.
   The withdrawals ``on the whole seem to be going pretty well as
expected, give or take some figures that are not really relevant.
... Meanwhile, we are not particularly apprehensive about the
withdrawal,'' he added.
   Yaqub Khan met reporters at the White House after greeting
President Reagan on behalf of Pakistan President Mohammed Zia
Ul-haq and congratulating Reagan for what the minister called ``a
foreign policy that has brought much credit to him, to his
administration and to his country, and has indeed been a historical
event.''
   He said he and Reagan did not discuss the pace of Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan but he thanked the president for U.S.
backing of the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan.

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on Friday
renewed his call for the nation to escalate the battle against
smoking with the same fervor it devotes to illicit drugs, and he
assailed a new smokeless cigarette as ``a drug in a
cigarette-shaped dispenser.''
   Koop and other anti-smoking witnesses told Congress that the
Food and Drug Administration should regulate any sales of the
``smokeless cigarette'' being developed by the R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., even though the agency does not have jurisdiction over
regular tobacco products.
   The surgeon general noted that ``Our nation has mobilized
enormous resources to wage a war on drugs _ illicit drugs. We
should also give priority to the one addiction _ tobacco addiction
_ that is killing more than 300,000 Americans each year.''
   Koop, as he has previously, declared that tobacco is as
addictive as cocaine and heroin. And he told a House subcommittee
that the FDA should regulate any sales of the so-called smokeless
cigarette because it ``contains nicotine, which is a drug in a
cigarette-shaped dispenser.''
   Koop testified to the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
health and the environment about the 618-page, anti-smoking report
he issued in May. ``Careful examination of the data,'' he said,
``makes it clear that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are
addicting. An extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is
the drug in tobacco that causes addiction.''
   Charles O. Whitley, representing the Tobacco Institute, said the
FDA barely has the resources to carry out its current duties
without adding tobacco products to its jurisdiction. He also said
Koop's report ``is a political document.''
   ``Its conclusions conform with the Surgeon General's political
goal of a smokeless society, and undoubtedly were reached long
before the report was drafted,'' Whitley said.
   R.J. Reynolds announced last September that it would market the
smokeless cigarette, which contains tobacco. Unlike other
cigarettes, the company says, it heats but does not burn the
tobacco to deliver the nicotine.
   Several organizations, including the American Lung
Association,the American Cancer Society and the American Medical
Association, have petitioned the FDA to take jurisdiction over the
proposed product by classifying it a drug.
   Several bills have been introduced in Congress to give the FDA
authority to regulate the proposed cigarette.
   Currently most regulation of tobacco products is administered by
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in the Treasury
Department and the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA has authority
over food products, drugs, medical devices and cosmetics.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young told the House subcommittee the
agency is reviewing the petitions against the smokeless cigarette
``to determine whether this product should be regulated under the
FDC (Food, Drug and Cosmetic) Act.''
   ``One can see that the agency must attempt to differentiate
between the traditional tobacco product, marketed without medical
claims, and therefore not regulated by FDA, and the newer
innovations designed to deliver nicotine to satisfy nicotine
dependence or otherwise to affect the structure or function of the
body,'' he said.
   Gregory R. Connolly, representing the American Public Health
Association, said that if R.J. Reynolds is serious about producing
a safer product, ``I suggest they voluntarily submit the device to
the FDA for safety and efficacy testing as a new therapeutic agent
to help smokers quit.
   ``If they refuse to do so then it is a clear signal that the
product is meant to improve the corporate health of R.J. Reynolds
and not the health of the American public,'' he said.
   Connolly said the association urges the FDA to regulate the
cigarette as it would any other drug delivery device.
   Scott Ballin, representing the Coalition on Smoking OR Health,
said the FDA already has sufficient legal authority and power to
regulate both cigarettes and new alternative nicotine delivery
products. ``The failure of the Food and Drug Administration to
assert this authority will inevitably and unnecessarily further
jeopardize the health and safety of the American public,'' he said.
   Richard M. Cooper, an attorney representing R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., said the FDA has no basis to assert control over the
proposed smokeless product, which he said will receive further
testing by the company before it is marketed.
   Cooper said the law covers a product's use, but not its
characteristics.
   ``Thus, cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco-containing
articles marketed for smoking pleasure, and other articles marketed
for smoking pleasure _ without therapeutic claims _ simply are not
drugs or devices, under the general interpretation by FDA and the
courts of the relevant provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act,'' he said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher
legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest,
saying ``nationalist passions'' benefit opponents of his reforms.
   The Soviet leader told a meeting of the Communist Party
leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some
regions of the country, due in part to ``active resistance put up
to perestroika by corrupt groups.''
   ``Perestroika,'' or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program for
widespread economic and social change.
   State-run media also indicated Friday that a crackdown had begun
on people in Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a
mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
The six-month conflict between the two republics over control of
the Nagorno-Karabakh district has led to mass rallies, strikes and
ethnic violence since February.
   The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive
body, intervened July 18. It rejected any change in
Nagorno-Karabakh's status but called for measures to develop the
region's economy and culture.
   The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the most rancorous
domestic disputes faced by Gorbachev since he became Communist
Party chief in March 1985. He indicated Friday he wants to defuse
tensions between ethnic groups, but also to punish those who
transform the tensions into a political crisis.
   Gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the Central
Committee, the party's policy-making body. A summary of his remarks
was distributed by the official Tass news agency.
   Gorbachev outlined the reasons for a ``current aggravation'' of
tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union,
Tass said.
   Among the causes, Gorbachev listed ``a lack of concern for many
years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups,
inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive
personnel, and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt
groups.''
   Tass said that after Gorbachev noted that ``nationalist passions
benefit all anti-perestroika forces,'' he suggested increasing
accountability in Soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife.
   Tass did not give details of Gorbachev's suggestion. At the July
18 Presidium meeting, the Soviet leader accused corrupt
conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the
Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive.
   Gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly
from Article 36 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which says the law
can punish ``any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness,
hostility or contempt.''
   Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve
ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the
country's 15 republics, a law on ``equal use'' of the more than 100
languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for
the country's republics and regions.
   In particular, the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, have
demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs.
   The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people in Yerevan, Armenia's
capital, will face criminal charges following an incident in which
activists seeking the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh attached
slogans to their cars and drove around the city. The paper did not
give the date or size of the mobile demonstration, but said 155
drivers have had their licenses revoked and 310 were fined.
   In its July 18th decision, the Presidium also ordered local law
enforcement agencies to ensure order was restored in the Caucasus
Mountain region. Tass reported Friday that the situation was
stabilizing in Armenia, but said that at the ``urging of
instigators,'' some strikes and protests were continuing.

<HEAD>Walters Says U.S. Ready to Release $188 Million Owed U.N.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States hopes to pay $188 million of
its debt to the United Nations before the year is out, to help
prevent the world body from running out of money when it may need
to mount a peacekeeping operation in the Persian Gulf, U.N.
Ambassador Vernon Walters said Friday.
   Walters told reporters he is ``guardedly optimistic'' that a
cease-fire will be arranged to halt the Iran-Iraq war, and
estimated initial costs of a U.N. peacekeeping force at $15 million
to $20 million.
   Walters, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said that if progress is reached at resolving other
world problems _ including the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan,
the Cuban presence in Angola, a transition to independence for
Namibia, and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia _ the U.N. could
face an annual peacekeeping bill of more than $1.5 billion.
   ``All of these are important to the interests of the United
States, and all are likely to involve the United Nations
significantly,'' Walters said. ``This increase in activity takes
place at a time when the U.N. is facing a very tight cash
situation.''
   The U.N.'s financial plight is due in part to the fact that the
United States, partly for policy reasons and partly because of
budget constraints, has withheld or been unable to pay its full
U.N. assessments.
   ``At present we owe the U.N. in excess of half a billion dollars
_ $467 million for the regular budget and $70 million for
peacekeeping,'' Walters noted.
   The United States has not paid its full assessment for three
years.
   The initial withholdings were intended to spur the U.N. into
making management and financial reforms.
   Walters said these changes were made in 1986.
   But in the congressional appropriations process over the past
two years, other large cuts were imposed with the United States
paying only $144 million of its $212 million assessment in 1987.
   Walters said it is too early to tell if the withholding of much
of the U.S. assessment has had a negative impact on the U.N.
peacekeeping efforts.
   He noted that U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar has
said that without a large U.S. payment the organization would run
out of funds by November.
   If the U.N. is required to mount a peacekeeping operation in the
Persian Gulf, it could run out of money in October, Walters said.
   But he said that the Reagan administration hopes ``to release
$188 million in regular payments to the United Nations between now
and the end of the calendar year.''
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., who sponsored the Senate amendment
to withhold payments to the U.N., suggested the debt be paid over a
period of years and Walters said that might be done.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the Foreign Relations chairman,
said the international prestige of the United States is
``compromised by our deadbeat status.''
   ``Frankly, it is embarrassing that the world's wealthiest
country won't pay its bills,'' he said.
   Another witness, Donald McHenry, who was the chief U.S.
representative to the U.N. in the Carter administration, said it is
``simply disgraceful and dishonorable if, now that events are
moving the way we want them to move, we again find some pretext not
to pay our share of the relatively modest expenses of consolidating
the peace.''
   At a time when ``peace may be breaking out'' in several areas of
the world, the U.N. secretary general is being interrupted in the
search for peace ``by the need to find enough money to pay the
utility bills at U.N. headquarters,'' McHenry said.
   He said that even if a cure was needed for the U.N. management
problems, the tactic of withholding part of the U.S. assessment was
``illegal, a clear violation of our solemn treaty obligations.''

   Thousands of sweet-toothed buyers, sellers and
distributors stepped into a child's fantasy Friday as they wandered
from booth to booth at a candy convention sampling free chocolates,
picture cookies and Gummy bears.
   And they had plenty to smile about: Candy industry news is
sugar-coated.
   Americans will spend about $12 billion dollars this year to
consume about 5 billion pounds of chocolate and non-chocolate
treats _ nearly 20 pounds per person. In the past five years, the
U.S. confectionery business has grown 3 percent to 6 percent
annually, according to industry figures.
   ``Candy is rolling strong,'' said Jerry Prescott, president of
DEBS, a confectionery distributor that tracks candy sales and
trends. ``Chocolate is still an in-thing. The concerns over acne
have been kind of disproven, you've got the dollar up so some
pretty big advertisers are coming in.''
   At the 43rd annual National Candy Wholesalers Association
convention, which began Thursday and ends Sunday, there was little
talk of cavities or the U.S. surgeon general's report earlier this
week about the importance of good nutrition in preventing diseases.
   ``The whole issue of health has dissipated so much,'' said
Shelley Grossman of the National Candy Wholesalers Association.
``As consumers have become more aware of their own health, they are
much more likely to treat themselves to something like candy.''
   Scant few granola bars or health snacks could be found on the
convention floor, though companies like Quaker Oats and Veryfine
juices had displays and microwave popcorn appeared popular.
   New sweets like Boogers, green and squishy and designed to look
like the real thing, and Slime Slurps, gummy monsters that change
color, had glitzy booths. Old reliables touted their time-tested
sweets.
   ``Pez is more than a candy _ it's a system,'' said Pez Candy Co.
president Scott McWhinnie, popping open a new Garfield dispenser to
demonstrate. ``It's great tasting and fun to play with at the same
time.''
   Pez was developed in 1927 in Vienna, Austria, and the dispenser
was introduced, sans heads, in Europe in 1950. Character heads and
flavors were added in the United States in 1952. Today Americans
consume about 1 billion Pez candies anually, McWhinnie said.
   But until recently, the company hadn't resolved the common
childhood lament: Pez topple over. ``Pez dispensers have feet,''
McWhinnie said, proudly. ``Now they stand up.''
   Tucked in a corner of a floor redolent of chocolate, Martin B.
Palmer, the president of the the 110-year-old Palmer Candy Co. of
Sioux City, Iowa, was handing out the LaFama, a chopped pecan and
cream bar covered in chocolate.
   The company uses 90-year-old copper kettles to make the bars,
which bear the same goofy package lettering used when the bar
debuted in 1914.
   ``Good candy doesn't go out of style,'' said Palmer, 31, the
fifth generation president of the company with annual sales of
nearly $10 million.
   Nationally, Snickers, made by M&M Mars, is the top seller of
some 750 different candy bar brands. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,
made by Hershey Foods, is number two, followed by peanut and then
plain M&Ms.
   M&M Mars and Hershey combine for about 70 percent of the
chocolate bar market. The reintroduction of red M&Ms last year
after an eight-year absence because of concerns over food dyes was
the talk of the candy world.
   The convention was not open to the public, but kids will get a
crack at the candy eventually. Organizers estimate two to three
tons of treats will be donated to charities at the end of the
meeting.

<HEAD>Reagan Approves Extension of Jackson's Secret Service Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan extended Jesse Jackson's
Secret Service protection 30 days to give Jackson time to arrange
private security against death threats the former Democratic
candidate says he has received, a White House spokesman said Friday.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Jackson had asked that
government protection be continued, based on the defeated
presidential candidate's ``assessment of threats against his life''
and Jackson's plans to campaign for Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis.
   In Chicago, Eric Easter, a spokesman for Jackson, said he had no
immediate comment on Reagan's decision. Jackson has been resting in
Chicago the past few days.
   Losing candidates for presidential nominations generally have to
relinquish their Secret Service detail as soon as the party
standardbearer is chosen. So Jackson technically had exhausted his
right to such protection on July 22 _ the day after the end of the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   However, Fitzwater said that Jackson ``asked for an extension of
Secret Service protection, presumably through the election. He
indicated that on the basis of threats against his life.''
   Asked if Jackson had furnished any details of death threats, the
spokesman replied, ``No.'' Asked whether the White House had tried
to verify threats against Jackson's life, he said he could not
comment on such security matters.
   Only the president is authorized to grant Secret Service
protection to non-presidential candidates. A joint House-Senate
committee in Congress screens declared candidates and recommends to
the Treasury Department which ones merit Secret Service protection.
   Secret Service spokesman Bob Snow said only that ``we do our
continuing assessments of (the security needs) of anybody we
protect.''
   Candidates are generally as tight-lipped as the government in
refusing to give specifics of threats they receive, although
Jackson has spoken several times in general terms of threats
against him during this year's campaign.
   Fitzwater said Jackson's Secret Service protection had been
maintained without interruption since the Democratic convention _
during which Dukakis formally won the nomination over Jackson _
while Reagan weighed whether to approve the extension.
   Reagan's decision was made ``within the last few days,'' the
spokesman said.
   He said that giving Jackson an additional 30 days of Secret
Service protection would cost roughly $600,000.
   Reagan's decision specifies that there will be no further
extension, the spokesman said.
   ``The feeling was that, first of all, he's not the nominee of
the party, which is what the law allows,'' he said. ``Secondly,
that it didn't seem reasonable to grant this extension once he
transitions into a private security situation.''
   He said there had been precedents for extending normal Secret
Service protection because of extenuating circumstances. For
example, protection was continued for a time for the widow of Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy after he was assassinated while running for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1968.

   Members of the Communist Party
leadership said on Friday that security forces may take stronger
action to quell ethnic strife in Kosovo, a southern province
dominated by Albanians.
   The proposal was made during a Central Committee meeting on ways
to reduce tension in Kosovo between the ethnic Albanians and the
Slavic minority, made up of Serbs and Montenegrans. It was
broadcast on state television.
   Stane Dolanc, a member of Yugoslavia's collective presidency,
said without elaboration that the leadership ``is considering the
additional engagement of ... a federal police unit'' stationed in
Kosovo since last October.
   The paramilitary, trained and equipped to quell large public
disturbances, was sent there to thwart an expected increase in
ethnic strife.
   It has taken little action since its arrival, however, and it
was not clear whether Dolanc wanted it to play a more active role
or was suggesting more units be sent.
   Vidoje Zarkovic of Montenegro called for the dispatch of
``additional public security forces from the entire country to help
in keeping law and order in Kosovo.''
   About 200 Serb and Montenegrans from Kosovo arrived in Belgrade
on Friday to demonstrate against what they say is persecution by
the ethnic Albanian majority.
   The original plan was for thousands to make the trip, but most
apparently heeded appeals by authorities not to protest during the
Central Committee meeting.
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
About 30,000 Serbs and Montenegrans have left the province, the
least-developed area of Yugoslavia, since riots in 1981.
   Franc Setinc, a Central Committee member from Slovenia, said:
   ``We cannot allow the current ethnic strife in Kosovo to turn
into a clash between different nationalities, because that would
have catastrophic consequences on this part of Europe.''
   Ethnic strife in the Balkans once earned the peninsula the
nickname ``the powder keg of Europe'' and its local conflicts
brought on World War I.
   Kosovo is an administrative part of the Servian republic.
Slobodan Milosevic, party leader of Serbia, told the Central
Committee constitutional that changes are necessary so Serbia can
exercise its authority in Kosovo and act against ethnic Albanians.
   He said ``counterrevolution'' by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
``represents a danger to socialism and to Yugosavia.''
   The 1974 Yugoslav constitution granted a large measure of
autonomy to Kosovo.

<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Cardinal John Dearden has been
hospitalized with inoperable cancer of the pancreas, a church
spokesman said Friday.
   Dearden, 80, retired as Archbishop of Detroit following a heart
attack in 1980, but has remained active in the College of
Cardinals, where he is a member of the Sacred Congregation for the
Sacraments.
   ``The cardinal is gravely ill, but he is resting comfortably,''
archdiocese spokesman Jay Berman said. ``Death is soon but not
imminent.''
   Last rites have not been administered, Berman said. Dearden has
been at Providence Hospital in Southfield for a week.
   ``The Cardinal does hope that it will be possible for him to be
discharged and go home,'' Berman said. ``It's not ruled out that he
might be able to go home for some time.''
   Dearden was named archbishop in January 1959, and his
resignation was accepted by Pope John Paul in July 1980. Dearden
continued to administer the diocese until May 1981, when Bishop
Edmund Szoka was named archbishop of the 1.5 million-member
diocese. Dearden was named a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1969.
Szoka was elevated to cardinal earlier this month.
   In a letter to priests, Szoka said Dearden's heart condition had
been successfully treated but he has suffered severe loss of
appetite, weight and energy. Tests showed the presence of tumors,
which have been found to be malignant.
   ``Cardinal Dearden has spent himself faithfully with loyal
dedication to the church for more than 55 years of priestly
ministry, 40 of those years as bishop,'' Szoka wrote. ``I ask for
your continuing prayers in his behalf especially now in his time of
need.''

<HEAD>Advest Suspends Broker in Business Week Leak Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A second brokerage sacked a stockbroker today in
a widening investigation of improper trading based on apparently
leaked tips of impending Business Week magazine articles.
   Prudential Bache Securities Inc. dismissed Brian Callahan, a
broker in its Anaheim, Calif., office, after it detected suspicious
trading by him, said spokesman Peter Costiglio. He said Callahan
had worked for the firm for about 3{ years but had no further
information about him.
   Business Week confirmed last week it had initiated an inquiry
into suspected leaks of its ``Inside Wall Street'' column.
   The Hartford, Conn., investment firm Advest Inc. suspended a
broker in its New London, Conn., office, where 10 brokers are
based, spokeswoman Martha Payne said today. She declined to
disclose the broker's identity or career history.
   ``The suspension was the result of an internal investgiation
which we conducted,'' she said. ``We've notified the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The investigation is continuing.''
   Officials at the New London office referred all inquiries to Ms.
Payne.
   The disclosure came a day after Wall Street giant Merrill Lynch
& Co. disclosed it had fired one employee and was questioning
another in connection with suspected trading based on
pre-publication tips from ``Inside Wall Street.''
   Merrill said it fired William Dillon, 33, a financial consultant
in its New London office, after company lawyers uncovered records
suggesting he bought and sold stocks with information from the
column.
   People familiar with the Merrill inquiry also said the firm was
examining the actions of a Merrill Lynch vice president, James
Smith, in the New London office.
   Smith had approved some of the questioned trades under a company
policy requiring junior employees trading for their own account to
get prior approval from senior executives, they said. No
disciplinary action has been taken against him.
   Company spokesman William Clark said Dillon had worked at
Merrill Lynch's New London office since 1986, but little other
information was available on the former employee. He said that to
his knowledge no charges had been filed against Dillon.
   A man who identified himself as Dillon's father in telephone
calls to Dillon's home in Old Lyme, Conn., said his son was
unavailable for comment. He declined to discuss the matter or
answer any questions. Smith did not return telephone calls.
   In its Aug. 8 issue, released to the press late Thursday,
Business Week acknowledged to readers it had discovered unusual
trading in shares mentioned in the Wall Street column and had
initiated an investigation.
   ``The relationship between Business Week and its readers is our
most valuable asset, and we intend to protect it,'' said the note
to readers.
   The note also said the magazine was cooperating with authorities
in the probe and had tightened its ``already stringent'' internal
security.
   Business Week, published by New York-based McGraw-Hill Inc.,
said last week its legal counsel was examining the entire operation
for possible leaks. Magazine officials believe the information
probably was leaked by workers at one of four plants that print
Business Week or by a postal employee rather than a member of its
editorial staff.
   Business Week confirmed it was investigating the situation after
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report made the initial disclosure
about possible leaks of information involving the column.
   Professional Investor Report said its analysis of 20 stocks
mentioned in the Business Week column had found at least eight
stocks rose sharply the day the magazines came off the presses but
before they were available to the public.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the major stock
exchanges also are investigating the matter.
   Most securities lawyers agree that the past conviction of a Wall
Street Journal reporter who leaked advance information to a
stockbroker would deter journalists from committing a similar act.
   R. Foster Winans was sentenced to an 18-month prison term
following his conviction of wire fraud in 1985 for passing tips
about items scheduled to appear in the newspaper's influential
``Heard on the Street'' column. A federal judge this week reduced
Winans' sentence to one year.
   Business Week, circulation 960,000, is printed weekly at four
plants, including one in Old Saybrook, Conn., located near New
London.
   R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. of Chicago, which operates the Old
Saybrook plant, said the company was conducting its own
investigation into possible leaks at the 550-employee plant and at
another plant in Torrance, Calif., and that anyone accused of
wrongdong faced disciplinary action.

<HEAD>Court Says Party, Not Courts, Must Settle Georgia GOP Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court ruled Friday that the feud
between rival Georgia delegations to next month's Republican
National Convention must be settled by the party at the convention,
not in the courts.
   Georgia GOP Chairman John Stuckey hailed the decision as a
victory, but former Chairman Matthew Patton, who sided with a group
of party dissidents, said the group intended to appeal further.
   The battle is between a delegation headed by party regulars,
including Stuckey, and one chosen by dissidents who took over the
party's state convention after Stuckey abruptly adjourned it in May.
   The national party's Committee on Contests will hold a hearing
on the dispute Aug. 8, a week before the GOP convention in New
Orleans. Both sides already have filed briefs with the committee.
   Eighteen at-large delegates are involved. Thirty of the state's
48 delegates to the national convention had already been chosen
before the state convention.
   At a news conference shortly after Friday's ruling, Stuckey
said, ``Today we're taking off the gloves'' in the battle with the
dissident faction.
   In court Wednesday, W.W. Larsen of Dublin, representing the
dissidents, said Stuckey and other party officials were trying to
disenfranchise political newcomers drawn into the party by the
candidacy of Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson.
   Larsen said party officials had arbitrarily used party rules to
bar Robertson supporters from participating in the state convention
in Albany.

   Bruce Adams of Laramie, Wyo., says he doesn't
want his brother's bones back in a bag, because after 22 years he
still believes Master Sgt. Steven H. Adams is alive in Southeast
Asia.
   Adams, whose brother's name is carved onto the Vietnam Memorial
as missing and presumed dead, said Friday he will join a Vietnam
veterans group's unusual effort to advertise a $2.4 million reward
to any Vietnamese, Lao or Cambodian citizen who brings out a live
American POW.
   The National Steering Committee for American War Veterans plans
to go to the Thailand-Vietnam border in October and distribute
thousands of dollars worth of Vietnamese currency stamped with a
message offering the reward which has been pledged privately by
several congressmen and others.
   If not stopped by the Thai government, which hindered a private
U.S. effort last year to send reward offers up in hundreds of
balloons, the group said it will float the bills in plastic bags
down the Mekong River and distribute them along the Thai side of
the river.
   ``I don't want bones. I want the live man. I want my brother,''
Adams told a news conference.
   He said in an interview that his brother, who would be 41 if he
is still alive, was shot down with six other Air Force personnel on
Oct. 18, 1966, over the northern part of the Gulf of Tonkin.
   Adams, a dentist, said that a few months ago a woman who had
worked for the Red Cross in Laos during the war verified
information that his family received from the Red Cross 10 months
after he was shot down. The woman said she had seen his brohter
severely injured but alive in 1967 and was surprised the U.S.
military concluded he was dead.
   Adams said he has also received information from a non-American
source, whom he said he promised not to identify, that his brother
was now held in a camp in Laos.
   ``I have not seen any black and white evidence, but I believe he
is alive,'' Adams said.
   The veterans group's chairman, Ted Sampley, said the effort to
advertise the reward by stamping Vietnamese bills originated with
former Vietnam Army nurse Lynn Hampton, who took it upon herself to
write messages on 3,000 bills she secretly distributed during a
recent visit to Vietnam with a missionary group.
   Ms. Hampton of Winter Haven, Fla., said she found no direct
evidence of live American prisoners during her visit.
   Sampley urged U.S. officials not to try to stop the
bill-stamping effort.
   ``It may seem weird, but it's going to do what we want it to do
_ advertise the reward,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Cheers Hundreds of Seriously Ill Children with Newsletter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman whose 7-year-old son died of cancer four
years ago now offers cheer to hundreds of ailing children in a
monthly newsletter packed with jokes, puzzles and stories.
   ``I can't cure them, but I know how to make them smile while
they're here,'' said Linda Bremner, 40.
   Her 10-page newsletters, called Love Letters, go to 465 children
with terminal or long-term illnesses in 35 states and four other
countries, she said Friday.
   Ms. Bremner said she began writing to seriously ill children in
1984, after the death of her only child, Andy.
   ``After my son died, I was cleaning out his drawers and I found
his address book with the addresses of about 20 children who, like
himself, had cancer.
   ``Remembering how important mail was to Andy, I wrote to them,''
she said.
   ``What I didn't expect was that they wrote me back and that lit
a fire under me,'' she said.
   Steven Lopez said the newsletter made his three-week hospital
stay ``much funner.''
   ``I like the dot-to-dots and the mazes most,'' said the
12-year-old, who suffers from a behavior disorder.
   ``And on the cards they say that they love me lots, so I felt
better,'' he said.
   ``It's the passion of my life. Nothing has ever made me feel
this good,'' said Ms. Bremner.
   ``When I lose one of my kids I grieve,'' she said. ``But it
gives me a fervor, and I sit down and write some more letters.''
   Ms. Bremner works part-time as a clerk to help pay the bills,
but ``Love Letters is really my full-time job.''
   The newsletters carry games, puzzles, jokes and ``witty and
whimsical'' stories, said Ms. Bremner, who has made it a rule never
to mention diseases or symptoms.
   But sometimes her correspondents address serious topics when
they write back, and she draws on her experiences with Andy.
   One 13-year-old girl wrote that she was being teased by
classmates because her hair was falling out.
   ``Andy had lost his hair five times and it grew back, so I wrote
her and told her it would grow back, too,'' Ms. Bremner said.
   When the girl's hair finally grew back, she sent a little lock
of blond hair with a note that read, ``You were right _ it grew
back,'' Ms. Bremner recalled.
   In the beginning, she was sending handwritten letters, she said.
   Now her pen pals get the newsletter, which is drafted on a
computer. About a dozen volunteers help design and and mail them.
   Ms. Bremner said she doesn't know how much is spent by Love
Letters, a non-profit organization. Postage alone runs $300 in an
average month.

   President Reagan plans to nominate James E.
Goodby, a veteran Foreign Service officer now a diplomat in
residence at the Foreign Service Institute, as ambassador to
Greece, the White House announced Friday.
   Goodby, 58, will succeed Robert Vossler Keeley on his
confirmation by the Senate.
   Goodby entered the Foreign Service in 1952. He was ambassador to
Finland in 1980-81, vice chairman of the U.S. delegation to the
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks from 1981-83, and U.S.
representative to the Conference on Security Building Measures and
Disarmament in Europe from 1983-85.
   He was diplomat in residence at Georgetown University in 1985-86
and since 1987 has been diplomat in residence and senior fellow for
the Center for the study of Foreign Affairs at the Foreign Service
Institute, the State Department's training agency.
   The White House also announced that the president plans to
nominate Sonia Landau, a New York city consultant and former
chairman of the board of directors of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, as coordinator for international communications and
information policy at the State Department. She would succeed Diana
Lady Dougan.

<HEAD>Transport Minister Suspends Crew After Airbus Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transport Minister on Friday suspended the
pilot and co-pilot of an Airbus A320 that crashed last month and
killed three people during a demonstration flight at an air show.
   Minister Michel Delebarre said in a statement that a preliminary
report submitted Thursday by an investigating commission revealed
``no failure of the aircraft or its equipment.'' The plane, he
said, followed all the orders provided by the crew.
   The computerized A320 is the latest Airbus model. The company, a
European consortium, says it is the fastest selling commercial
plane in history.
   In the June 26 accident near Mulhouse, the plane failed to come
out of a low pass, struck the tops of trees near a runway and
crashed into a forest.
   Delebarre criticized the state-run airline Air France, operator
of the plane, for the ``inadmissible conditions'' of the aircraft's
participation and mission at the airshow.
   He said he was suspending the two crew members because of
``elements about the circumstances of the flight exposed by the
commission investigating the accident.'' There was no elaboration
on either point.
   There have been conflicting reports about the altitude of the
plane at the time of the accident. The pilot has testified his
instruments showed the plane was flying at about 90 feet, but
sources quoted investigators as saying the plane was at 30 feet.
   Examining Magistrate Charles Bertin said the minister's decision
does not influence a judicial investigation of the accident still
under way.
   ``It is purely an internal sanction,'' the French news agency
Agence France-Presse quoted Bertin as saying. ``It does not at all
mean that the two pilots will be charged for penal infractions.''
   Bertin, who is in charge of the judicial probe, added: ``This
measure has nothing to do with judicial decisions which could
eventually be taken.''

   The best advice for those attending the
biggest convention in town is don't pack any clothes, don't forget
the suntan lotion and for goodness' sake don't stare.
   Nudists _ hundreds of men, women and children _ are meeting to
have fun and get naked.
   ``Looking is not a no-no, but staring is,'' said Turner Stokes,
60, of Leesburg, Va., an electronics engineer who is president of
the 30,000-member American Sunbathing Association. ``I'm sure the
staring is much worse out among the textiles.''
   ``Textiles'' is a nudists' term for people who wear clothes.
They are the outsiders at the 106-acre White Thorn Lodge, a
pleasant, wooded campground on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.
   Members of the Eastern Sunbathing Association, a division of the
national group, are meeting through Sunday to elect officers,
organize committees, lie in the sun, swim and play games.
   ``It's the freedom. It's the comfort. Our society equates nudity
with sexuality, but this is a totally non-sexual setting. People
are just people here,'' said Mary Lou Schloss, 40, of Rochester,
N.Y., a nudism activist who brought her husband and children to the
convention.
   ``I just like the swimming pool, the hot tub and the food,''
said her son, Evan, 8, a third-grader who wore only cherry soda on
his face Thursday.
   ``Most people seek the breeze, the sun, the rain and the freedom
of wearing no pantyhose,'' said Lynn Arnett, 44, a free-lance
writer from Paradise Lakes, Fla. ``You tell the first lie of the
day when you put your clothes on.''
   Security is very tight for the convention. Clothed and nude men
guard the gate. ``Textile'' reporters who shed only their ties are
escorted among friendly families sharing lunch on picnic tables,
smiling couples sitting on shaded lawn chairs and naked children
running across the grass.

   When Dorothy Davis opened her monthly
electric bill, she got quite a charge. It said she owed more than
$3 million.
   It was $3,500,043.00, to be exact.
   ``I nearly died. I called the company, and they said it was
bound to be a mistake,'' Mrs. Davis said. ``I said, ``Yes, it is.'''
   The error apparently occurred when a Kentucky Utilities Co.
employee changed Mrs. Davis' monthly bill, said company spokesman
Ed Van Hook.
   Mrs. Davis pays her bills on the company's budget plan. A
billing clerk was supposed to raise the bill from $43 to $50
because Mrs. Davis was using more electricity, Van Hook said. But
the clerk forgot to press a computer key to substitute the new
amount for the old amount, he said.
   Then another three and some zeros got combined with both the old
and new bills.
   ``If I had a bad heart, it would have given me a heart attack,''
Mrs. Davis said.

   State officials were ordered to put their
weekly Cabinet meeting reports in sealed envelopes after
confidential papers from the governor's office were found in a
men's restroom at the Capitol.
   The order came after a July 11 meeting, when a 10-page report
called ``Memorandum to Gov. Garrey Carruthers from staff'' was
discovered in the bathroom two floors away, said Carruthers'
spokesman, Don Caviness.
   A member of the Legislative Finance Committee found the document
when he was washing his hands, said committee director Phil Baca.
   ``To be frank with you, I never got around to reading the thing,
but some of the staff got a kick out of reading this stuff,'' he
said.
   Caviness said the report, which contained weekly highlights from
Cabinet secretaries and the governor's staff, was not ``designed to
be widely distributed.''

   You might say E.H. ``Curly'' Schukar and
the neighborhood squirrel see eye to eye at feeding time.
   Schukar has trained the animal to take peanuts as he holds them

   ``Everybody that sees me do that thinks I'm nuts, of course.
Naturally, with nuts you get nuts,'' Schukar said.
   Schukar, 80, and his neighbors adopted the squirrel this spring.
   ``No other squirrel would do that,'' Schukar said. ``No other

   The squirrel is reluctant to perform when people gather to watch

   The 90 residents of this central Ohio
village couldn't wait any longer for work to finish on the bridge
that links them with the rest of the world.
   Although reconstruction on the Toboso Bridge is not expected to
be completed for two to three weeks, the excitement over the
reopening gave way to a village party on the bridge, complete with
food, music and even a ribbon-cutting ceremony. A construction
crane and piles of gravel served as the backdrop.
   ``It's a test, really,'' Mike Scott said Wednesday night as he
sat at a table on the concrete span over the Licking River. ``If we
can get 200 people on the bridge and it holds up, they'll let the
cars across.''
   The bridge closed in April, and since then getting anywhere
since has meant miles of detours on winding county and township
roads.

<HEAD>Swaggart Conducts Service At Garden Tomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television preacher Jimmy Swaggart asked his
congregation to judge themselves, not others, during a service
Friday in the garden where tradition says Jesus was buried.
   ``Look into your own hearts today,'' said Swaggart, reading from
the Bible. ``Don't judge others.'' Turning to his 350 listeners, he
asked: ``Did you hear what I say?'' Several responded: ``Yes.''
   Swaggart, who arrived in Israel on Thursday for a 10-day tour of
biblical sites, lost his credentials as an Assemblies of God
minister earlier this year after he refused to stop preaching for a
year as punishment for meeting with a prostitute in New Orleans.
   After the service, Swaggart told reporters: ``God is the one who
puts things in the past ... That's the beautiful thing about
Christianity. People love, they forgive and they forget.''
   He said he had been humbled by the public scandal that occurred
after the disclosure of his sexual activities in February. The
disclosures led him to confess tearfully on nationwide television
that he had sinned.
   ``I think that I have more love for people now,'' said Swaggart.
``I think that I feel their pain a little more ... This world is a
hurting world and maybe I'm a little less condemnatorial, maybe I'm
a little bit less accusatorial.''
   Swaggart's congregants appeared moved by his 45-minute sermon.
Some cried. Others raised their hands in the air and uttered,
``Hallelujah'' or ``Praise the Lord.''
   ``I love him, I love him,'' said Ray Grant, 55, of Houston.
   But others voiced criticism of Swaggart.
   ``I wouldn't say his deeds enhanced his image,'' said Oleda
McCurdy of Fort Pine, Ala. ``But you have to forgive.''
   ``I was bothered by how the scandal was handled,'' said Charles
Kester, 20, of Siloam Springs, Ark. ``I wonder about the soundness
of his leadership.''
   Kester, in Israel for the first time, said the country was ``a
bit different from what I imagined. Here you see tanks and people
on street corners carry Uzi submachine guns. That's not the way it
looks in the picture on the back of the Bible.''
   Swaggart's tour is called ``Journey With A Purpose.'' A
television crew will tape his sermons and the footage will be shown
on his daily television show.
   The Garden Tomb is one of two sites where tradition says Jesus
was buried. The other is inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in
the Old City.

<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York, wife of Prince Andrew, will
soon give birth to her first child following an active pregnancy
which survived two accidents, a family scandal and a flood of
rumors.
   Buckingham Palace insists the birth is due in mid-August, but
Britain already looks set for a fresh bout of royal baby hoopla,
spurred by excited predictions in the tabloid press that the big
day is imminent.
   The Sun newspaper said Friday the duchess' weight and other
health problems may force a Caesarian delivery this weekend.
   On July 22, the Star claimed the birth was likely to be
artificially induced within 48 hours because the duchess feared
losing the baby.
   Every other day, Andrew is prematurely reported to have left his
Royal Navy ship in Singapore to be at her side during the delivery.
   But Buckingham Palace is sticking to its forecast and refusing
to comment on the press reports.
   The baby, to carry the title Prince or Princess of York, will be
Queen Elizabeth II's fifth grandchild and fifth in line to succeed
her.
   ``Complications which could endanger mother and baby have led
her doctors to give up the wait for a natural delivery,'' the Sun
reported Friday.
   The newspaper said without attribution that the duchess' doctor
had decided on a Caesarian section because she is suffering from
high blood pressure and severe water retention, and because the
baby is in a breech position, meaning it would be born bottom first
rather than head first, as is normal.
   The Star added that the ``roly-poly'' duchess has gained almost
50 pounds during the pregnancy.
   The 28-year-old duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, married
Andrew, the queen's second oldest son, in July 1986. When she
didn't become pregnant in the first year, the British media
speculated that ``Fergie'' was being treated for infertility,
although her family repeatedly denied it.
   The duchess radiated good health during the early months of her
pregnancy. She skiied in Europe, performed a full calendar of royal
engagements and worked at her publishing job until February. When
the palace confirmed her pregnancy on Jan. 25, the duchess was
taking a helicopter flying lesson.
   Then came two scares and a family scandal.
   The duchess fell into an icy stream while skiing in the French
Alps in March, when she was four months pregnant. Earlier this
month she escaped injury when her car, driven by a police
bodyguard, collided with another car on a busy highway outside
London.
   Meanwhile, the tabloids discovered that her father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, was frequenting a London massage parlor. The scandal
almost got him expelled from his polo club.
   The duchess has broken with royal tradition in her choice of
doctor and hospital.
   Instead of Dr. George Pinker, royal gynecologist since 1973 and
deliverer of nine princes and princesses, she has chosen Dr.
Anthony Kenney, a prominent London obstetrician known to favor
natural childbirth.
   She has picked the private, American-owned Portland Hospital in
west London, unlike her sisters-in-law, Princess Diana and Princess
Anne, who had their babies in the private wing of a state-run
hospital.
   The modern Portland Hospital is said to be Britain's most
expensive maternity clinic.
   The Sun says Room 201 has been reserved for the duchess and
decorated with pink wallpaper and mauve floral curtains.
   Andrew was quoted as saying in May that the baby will be a girl
and will be named Annabelle. He refused a gift of a child's cricket
bat from a Yorkshire cricket team, saying: ``It won't be much use
... I'm sure we are having a girl.''
   However, the prince has a reputation as a prankster, and
Buckingham Palace said of his comments, ``It's all speculation.''
   Bookmakers William Hill say Annabelle remains the favorite name
for a girl and David for a boy.

<HEAD>FAA Orders Inspection of Brakes on Long-Range DC-10s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday
ordered a special inspection of landing gear brakes on long-range
McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft and directed that the brakes be
replaced if they exceed prescribed wear limits.
   The order came in response to a May 21 accident involving an
American Airlines DC-10 last May in which eight of the plane's 10
brakes failed when the pilot aborted his takeoff, causing the plane
to skid 1,000 feet beyond the runway at the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport.
   The three crewmembers in the cockpit and five of the 240
passengers were injured and the plane was heavily damaged.
   The FAA directive applies only to McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Series
30 and Series 40 planes, the somewhat heavier long-range version of
the aircraft, said FAA spokesman Dick Stafford.
   According to McDonnell Douglas, there are 66 of the long-range
DC-10s in service in the United States and 229 worldwide. Among the
airlines that fly the long-range plane are Northwest Airlines,
United Airlines, American Airlines and the freight carrier Federal
Express.
   Under the FAA order, the inspections must be made by Aug. 20 and
by that date all brakes that do not meet prescribed wear limits
must be replaced, said Stafford.
   The order does not apply to lighter, shorter-range DC-10 Series
10 aircraft of which there are about 120 being flown by U.S. air
carriers, generally in domestic service, according to FAA and
McDonnell Douglas officials.
   Earlier this month, the National Transportation Safety Board as
a result of its findings in the Dallas-Fort Worth accident,
expressed concern about the FAA's brake wear requirements.
   The safety board urged a broad review of the requirements for
all types of jetliners. The FAA told the NTSB it was in the early
stages of reviewing its brake wear requirements.
   In the May 21 accident involving the American Airlines jet, the
pilot aborted his takeoff while traveling 204 mph down the runway
because he thought _ erroneously it later turned out _ that his
flaps or slats may have been in the wrong position.
   The plane slowed to 149 mph in the first six seconds, but ``the
deceleration decayed rapidly'' and the jet went off the end of the
runway still traveling 117 mph, according to the NTSB. The jet lost
its nose gear and plowed through the dirt for 1,000 feet before
coming to a halt.
   Investigators found that eight of the 10 landing gear brakes
``were near the maximum wear limits'' before the aborted takeoff
and failed within 8 to 9 seconds after being applied, the safety
board said July 11.

<HEAD>American Jewish Leader Urges Moscow To Adopt New Emigration Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent American Jewish leader, after a
meeting Friday with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, urged the
Soviet Union to broaden its recently proclaimed policy of allowing
Jews who emigrate to choose their new homeland.
   Morris B. Abram, chairman of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, said Moscow should allow more Jews to apply for exit permits
to any country of their choice, rather than just Israel. A Kremlin
official said Thursday that ``It's up to them where they go.''
   Most Soviet Jews permitted to emigrate are given exit permits
for Israel, but about 90 percent go to the United States once they
reach Vienna, the transit point to Tel Aviv.
   Concerned about the loss of immigrants, the Israeli Cabinet has
ordered a change in procedures. Soviet Jews granted exit permits
would receive their Israeli visas in Romania and go on to Israel.
From there it would be difficult to get to the United States
because they would no longer have refugee status.
   Abram said the Israeli government ``has a right to make that
decision'' and that it would be ``a travesty'' to permit immigrants
from the Soviet Union to retain refugee status once they reached
Israel.
   ``It would be a declaration that a Jew, welcomed as he is in
Israel, is a refugee in his homeland,'' Abram said. ``That would be
a terrible construction of the meaning and purpose of the Jewish
state.''
   Soviet Jews who go to Israel are considered immigrants under
U.S. law. As a result, it is much more difficult for them to gain
admission to the United States than as refugees in Vienna.
   The situation has caused some strains between American Jews and
Israel as well as disputes within the American Jewish community.
   The solution, Abram said, lies in the Soviet government's
assertion that it does not care where emigrants chose to live. He
cited a statement on Thursday by Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir
Petrovsky in Moscow that ``we just allow all these people to leave
the country. It's up to them where they go.''
   Abram said ``as long as that is the position of the Soviet
government it is quite possible for freedom of choice to be
exercised in the Soviet Union.''
   In the past year, the Soviet Union has increased Jewish
emigration to the West to a rate of more than 1,000 a month,
compared to 1,000 a year in the early 1980s.
   According to statistics compiled by The National Conference on
Soviet Jewry, 60 to 90 Jews a month are permitted to leave directly
for the United States. Abram said 6,000 non-Jews were allowed to go
last year.
   ``So the idea that it is Soviet policy to prevent people from
leaving directly on American visas doesn't seem to be the case,''
Abram said. ``In this case, it seems to be that what they say is
what they have been doing. Let's hope they continue.''
   Abram said Shultz supports the principle of freedom of choice.
Otherwise, he and State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman
declined to elaborate on Shultz's position.

   State agriculture officials banned the
movement of some fruits and vegetables in a suburban area and made
plans Friday to release millions of sterile flies to combat the
destructive Mediterranean fruit fly.
   No new Mediterranean fruit flies were found Friday in the
quarantine area, 62 square miles of the San Fernando Valley, a
collection of bedroom communities 10 miles northwest of downtown
Los Angeles.
   ``That's a very good sign that aerial spraying and ground
spraying are working,'' said Gera Curry, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Food and Agriculture.
   The Medfly infestation was discovered in the San Fernando Valley
city of Northridge more than a week ago. Four Medflies have been
found thus far.
   The Medfly, one of the most destructive crop-destroying insects,
is common in Hawaii and probably was carried into Southern
California on fruit brought by tourists.
   Last Monday, 16 square miles of the San Fernando Valley was
sprayed with pesticides by helicopter, and ground crews also have
been spraying.
   The produce quarantine, which began Thursday, bans removal or
movement of home-grown fruit and garden vegetables in the
quarantine area.
   The quarantine also prohibits the sale of produce from street
and pushcart vendors. In addition, it bans residents from taking
fruits and vegetables into their workplaces for distribution.
   ``By moving fruit out of that quarantine area, you may be moving
Medfly,'' Ms. Curry said. ``The whole point of this is to make sure
anything that moves is safe.''
   Grocery stores and fruit and vegetable stands whose suppliers
treat the food with pesticide will be allowed to continue selling
produce.
   Meanwhile, officials said they plan to release 4 million sterile
flies next week. The release of sterile flies will drastically
reduce the chances of the female Medflies laying eggs, state and
county officials explained.
   The quarantine is expected to last until early November, but
agriculture officials said it could end earlier if the infestation
is eradicated.
   There was a five-month, 110-square-mile quarantine in eastern
Los Angeles in July 1987, because of a slightly larger medfly
infestation. The state's most serious infestation cost $97.6
million in eradication efforts that continued from 1980 to 1982.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Angry at Wilderness Water Rights Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, in a decision
angering environmentalists, said wilderness areas have no automatic
claim to water rights, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said Friday.
   ``This is a major victory for the western states, water users
and the principles of federalism,'' Hodel, flanked by a happy group
of Republican lawmakers from the West, told a Capitol Hill news
confernce.
   Hodel said that soon-departing Attorney Gen. Edwin Meese III
concurs with a legal opinion by Interior solicitor Ralph Tarr that
Congress must specifically award water to a wilderness area when it
creates the no-development enclave.
   ``This is a public resource giveaway of monumental
proportions,'' said Debbie Sease of the Sierra Club. ``Hodel and
Meese are sacrificing the lifeblood of our wilderness areas _ water
_ by saying, `Come and get it, we won't defend it.'''
   Hodel noted that U.S. District Court rulings disagree on a major
question in the arid West: Does the mere creation of a wilderness
area by Congress guarantee it will have enough water to ensure its
proper management.
   He said the administration was siding with a recent ruling in
New Mexico that said there are no water rights unless Congress
writes them into wilderness legislation.
   Congress has been skirting the controversial issue in wilderness
bills, leaving it up to to the Interior and Agriculture departments
and the courts to settle conflicting demands for scarce water.
   ``In most cases, these wilderness bills would not have passed if
Congress had to take water away from someone,'' Hodel said. ``In
order to get this water, you have to take it away from someone
else.''
   Under the administration policy, the rights of existing water
users, including federal forests, parks and wilderness areas and
Indian tribes, wold be maintained and protected, according to Hodel.
   He indicated that new areas lacking specific statutory water
guarantees will have to compete for water with other users before
various state water allotment authorities.
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, said that ``the people who live along
the banks of the Snake River are much better qualified to make
decisions about water use than the people who live along the banks
of the Potomac River.''
   ``This is an important decision for all of us in the West,''
added Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah. Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, said the
policy ``will help us resolve an issue that has confounded us.''
   Hodel's announcement was immediately attacked by environmental
groups and by Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., who called the news
conference a political event because it reiterated a position the
administration has previously taken.
   ``The current administration feels threatened in the West
because of the all-out offensive by (Democratic presidential
nominee) Michael Dukakis,'' said Wirth, who sat in the audience at
the news conference.
   ``This is the first time I've seen a full-blown press conference
on a solicitor's opinion,'' Wirth said. ``This doesn't solve
anything except inflame things politically.''
   The policy runs counter to a U.S. District Court ruling in
Colorado in 1985 and to a 1979 opinion by an Interior Department
solicitor during the Carter administration, said Maggie Fox of the
Sierra Club.
   ``This marks a new low in Meese's and Hodel's flagrant disregard
for the law,'' she said.
   ``The spirit of James Watt is alive and well,'' said Wilderness
Society vice president Sydney Butler, referring to the
administration's first interior secretary.
   Christopher Meyer, a water lawyer for the National Wildlife
Federation, said that ``the decision reflects just about as much
careful thought as the administration's decision to sell arms to
Iran.''
   Hodel said the policy has ``the distinct possibility'' of
extending beyond the current administration.

   Iran's commander-in-chief said Friday
that enemy forces had pushed 65 miles into Iran and threatened a
provincial capital but that Iran had routed the invaders and was
pushing them back toward the border.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is also speaker of Parliament, warned
Iraq that if it ``decides to continue the war, then they must know
that our strength today is by far greater than that of the time
prior to the acceptance of the resolution,'' he said. Iran accepted
a U.N. cease-fire resolution July 18.
   Speaking at a prayer service broadcast on Tehran radio,
Rafsanjani said Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels entered a hospital in
the western town of Eslamabad and ``rained bullets on some 30
patients,'' killing all of them.
   In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, a spokesman for the rebel
fighters, the National Liberation Army of Iran, said they pulled
out of Eslamabad and Karand, 60 miles inside Iran, after holding
the cities for three days. The rebel group did not comment on the
Iranian charges of a massacre.
   A seven-member U.N. team, meanwhile, arrived in Baghdad on
Friday to discuss implementation of U.N. Resolution 598. The seven
officials, led by Norwegian Lt. Gen. Martin Vadset, arrived after
visiting Tehran and are expected to spend three days in Baghdad.
They refused to comment to reporters.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
denied persistent reports that his peace talks with Iran and Iraq
are in trouble.
   ``Be patient,'' Perez de Cuellar said. ``And we will make
progress rather soon ... I am constantly in touch with the parties.
I keep working.''
   The process has stalled over Iraq's insistence on direct talks
and Iran's rejection of a face-to-face meeting before a cease-fire
is declared in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf conflict.
   Iran said it drove the Iraqi-backed rebel fighters out of
Eslamabad and Karand, killing or wounding 4,500 invaders in a
``heavy battle'' against ``forces of the Baghdad regime and their
hypocritical mercenaries.''
   Iran's armed forces were chasing the troops back toward Sar-e
Pol-e Zahab, 24 miles from the Iran-Iraq border, Iran claimed.
   Iranian press reports, monitored in Nicosia, said thousands of
invaders were wounded and more than 1,000 Iraqi tanks and personnel
carriers were either destroyed or seized intact.
   ``The operation destroyed the Islamic republic's cancer, which
... could have caused problems for Iranians,'' Rafsanjani told the
prayer congregation in Tehran in an apparent reference to the
rebels.
   In the sermon, he acknowledged the invaders had pushed 65 miles
into Iran, coming within 22 miles of the provincial capital of
Bakhtaran.
   ``This was a revolt that had to be destroyed, and if the Iraqi
regime wants to continue its aggressions, it will receive the same
response,'' Rafsanjani said.
   Tehran radio interrupted its normal programs to play martial
music and announce the victory over the National Liberation Army.
   The rebel group, in a communique released in Baghdad, said its
fighters ``returned to their bases'' Friday after three days of
fighting in which 40,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards were killed
or wounded.
   No independent observers were allowed near the fighting and
claims from both sides could not be verified.
   The rebels, estimated at 15,000, operate a series of bases along
the border. The National Liberation Army, the fighting arm of the
resistance group known as Mujahedeen Khalq, set up its headquarters
in Iraq after being expelled from France in 1986.

<HEAD>Youth Crackdown Triggers Riot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An arrest for underage drinking triggered a
late night riot with 50 young people marching on the police
station, breaking windows, and bending a flag pole and taking the
flag, police said Friday.
   A crowd of up to 300 people gathered during the hour-long melee,
prompting the 13-member police force to call on state police and
eight nearby communities for reinforcements.
   Damage in the town of about 13,000 people in northcentral
Pennsylvania was estimated at several thousand dollars. Six adults
and two youths were arrested. Three police officers were treated
for minor injuries.
   Mayor Charles E. Moll imposed a state of emergency, prohibiting
groups of youths from walking the streets between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m.
for five days.
   ``I'm particularly disturbed about them bending over the flag
pole and taking the flag,'' he said.
   The disturbance was seen as the culmination of months of tension
between police and young people who gather on the town's main
thoroughfare, Market Street.
   ``All they want to do is loaf on the main street,'' Moll said.
``There's drugs, there's drink, there's sex.''
   Tensions flared late Thursday when police tried to arrest a
teen-age girl and another youth for alleged underage drinking on
Market Street.
   Police said the two, whom they would not identify, resisted
arrest. During a struggle, an officer was kicked in the groin
several times and other police were called, Brown said.
   During the arrest, a group of 30 to 40 youths stood across the
street and yelled obscenities, police said.
   After the two youths were wrestled into a police car, the group
marched toward the police station, growing to about 50 people who
knocked over trash cans and a soda machine, police said.
   At the police station, witness Kerry Wolf of Selinsgrove said he
saw about six or seven people pull up plants, smash windows and
urinate inside. Some people grabbed a rope on the flagpole outside
the station, yanked on it and bent the pole and tore off the flag.
   Within 15 minutes, after reinforcements had arrived, about 75
officers and Sunbury firefighters formed a line and dispersed the
crowd.
   Several witnesses told The Daily Item newspaper that police were
rough with the juveniles and later used nightsticks on some
bystanders.
   Wolf told the newspaper he saw the girl's head being slammed on
the roof of the police car. ``They did rough-house that kid,'' said
Roger Lauver, 23, of Sunbury.
   Sgt. Stephen Brown said police threw no punches. ``Force is
sometimes necessary to effect an arrest,'' he said.
   Moll said he was satisfied with police conduct.

<HEAD>Party Leadership Approves Reform Plans, Gorbachev Urges Lean Party</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Gorbachev remarks on pruning
party and accomplishments of nationwide conference; EDITS to
conform and TRIM.</NOTE>

   The Kremlin leadership on Friday adopted broad
goals for making government more responsive, and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev urged pruning the Communist Party to exclude all but the
best and brightest, Tass said.
   The Soviet leader asked the Communist Party Central Committee to
have the parliament meet in November to make constitutional changes
allowing contested elections next March, Tass said. But it was
unclear from the report whether the committee adopted all of
Gorbachev's proposals.
   Gorbachev's proposal calls for multi-candidate elections to a
new 2,250-member Congress of Peoples' Deputies, which in turn would
choose a full-time parliament of at least 400 members and a
president with broad powers.
   Tass, the official news agency, issued a brief dispatch on the
eight-hour meeting that included only vague descriptions of decrees
and decisions adopted by the Central Committee, which has about 300
members.
   Its report on Gorbachev's opening address said he touched on
many issues, including youth problems and nationalities,
specifically the debate over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh. The
Caucasus enclave is part of Azerbaijan but its predominantly
Armenian population wants it annexed to Soviet Armenia.
   The 57-year-old Soviet leader also said he wants the 20-million
membership of the Communist Party reduced ``significantly'' to
include only the vanguard of Soviet society.
   At present, less than 10 percent of Soviet adults gain
admittance to the all-powerful party.
   Gorbachev also said a nationwide conference held a month ago
confirmed the Communist Party's role as ``the real driving force''
of reform. He said the meeting's major accomplishment was
recognizing the party's predominance.
   Membership rolls are to be reviewed before the end of the year.
That process could be used to dump the idle and corrupt or to
strengthen Gorbachev's base by revoking the memberships of his
conservative opponents.
   Gorbachev also acknowledged Friday that the nationwide
conference also ``demonstrated that conservative sentiments,
longing for the past, attempts to sow doubts, to portray
perestroika not as a historic endeavor but almost as a social
destabilization have by far not yet been overcome in society.''
   ``Perestroika'' is the term for Gorbachev's program of economic
and social reform.
   Gorbachev has faced resistance from some party members who think
he is moving too fast to change how Soviet society and its economy
have operated for decades.
   The Central Committee approved resolutions on ``reports and
voting in party organizations'' and on ``the general directions of
reconstruction of the party apparatus,'' Tass said.
   A special commission was formed, with Gorbachev as chairman,
``for the preparation of proposals for implementing the decisions
of the 19th All-Union Party Conference,'' it reported.
   That forum, which ended July 1, authorized a major revamping of
individual rights and the structure of government. Among its
recommendations were limiting elected party and government
officials to two five-year terms and multiple candidates for
elective office.
   Tass said the Central Committee meeting was over and details of
its actions would be published in the press.
   A spokesman at the Central Committee's information department
would not say whether changes had been made to the 13-member ruling
Politburo.
   ``You will have to wait for the official announcements,'' he
said, and asked that his name not be used.
   Western and Soviet sources had predicted at least one
longstanding member would resign during the meeting and perhaps set
a precedent for orderly retirement from the Politburo, whose
members traditionally have served for life or been voted out in
disgrace.
   Among those reported in line for retirement are President Andrei
A. Gromyko, 79, and Mikhail S. Solomentsev, 74. There have been
persistent rumors that Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, the Ukrainian
party chief, would be ousted or retired and Viktor M. Chebrikov,
head of the KGB secret police, replaced.
   The Politburo decided July 4 that the Central Committee would
meet to implement ``reforms of the political system, the
democratization of party, state and social life.''
   Gorbachev has also called for a society ruled by laws, which he
said would avoid a return of Stalinist repression or the corruption
and stagnation that characterized Leonid I. Brezhnev's leadership.
   Resolutions adopted by the party conference provided an outline
for change, which the Central Committee must translate into
specific programs and a timetable.
   They range from ending bureaucratic meddling in agriculture to
making all non-classified government information available to the
citizenry.

<HEAD>Army Issues Reassurances on Five Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army issued reassurances Friday that it
was not making or storing chemical weapons at all five sites the
U.S. government would open up for inspection under a proposed
international treaty.
   And a spokesman, Lt. Col. John Chapla, stressed that U.S.
chemical weapons are designed not to become lethal until they reach
the battlefield.
   The Army issued a detailed statement the day after Ambassador
Max Friedersdorf, chief U.S. delegate to the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva, listed five sites that the American
government would declare as production facilities under a proposed
international convention banning chemical weapons.
   The talks, involving 40 nations, have been going on for 20 years.
   The sites mentioned by Friedersdorf were: Rocky Mountain
Arsenal, Colo.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark.; Muscle Shoals, Ala.;
Newport Army Ammunition Depot, Ind., and Aberdeen Proving Ground,
Md.
   In a related development, a Senate panel that has been
investigating the Army's chemical weapons program gave it high
marks for safety.
   ``At the most critical point, where workers are in close
proximity to the agent, the chemical safety program is the
strongest. The workers at chemical storage areas are confident that
they work in a safe environment,'' said the report, which was
written by the Army's inspector general and released by the Senate
Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee.
   The Army resumed producing chemical weapons last December after
stopping in 1969. Spokesmen say the current so-called binary
weapons pose fewer storage and handling dangers than earlier
unitary weapons because they consist of two separate chemicals
which are brought together in an artillery shell just before firing.
   ``The binary program is such that you never have a complete
weapon stored in any one place. The two chemicals are never kept
together and they will not be mated until just before firing,''
said Chapla, the spokesman.
   Should a chemical weapons treaty be signed, said Chapla, all
five sites mentioned in Geneva would be subject to whatever
provisions it may contain regarding the inspection or dismantling
of facilities.
   ``The context of Ambassador Friedersdorf's statement is that at
each of the locations he identified, facilities exist which are, or
were at one time involved in the production of chemical weapons,''
the statement said.
   ``While all five of the facilities mentioned had some historical
connection with production of unitary chemical weapons (using one
rather than two chemicals), the U.S. has not been involved in the
production of unitary chemical weapons since 1969,'' the statement
said.
   ``No chemical weapons production of any kind is going on at
Rocky Mountain Arsenal or Newport Army Ammunition plant,'' it said.
   ``The Army facilities at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, are involved in
the production of a non-lethal component for the binary weapons
system.''
   ``No chemical weapons are being produced at Aberdeen proving
ground. Aberdeen was formerly connected with the production of
unitary chemical weapons prior to 1969.''
   ``No chemical weapons are being produced at Muscle Shoals,'' the
statement said. ``At present, the Muscle Shoals facility is
involved in a pilot plant project which will be used to prove out
the production process for one of the'' two chemicals involved it
the final weapon.
   Spending for biological and chemical research has increased
sharply since President Reagan took office in 1981. In fiscal 1980,
the total research was $63.5 million, compared with $348 million
figure in fiscal 1986.

   Iraqi officials say their greatest
achievement in the Persian Gulf war was preventing Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini from exporting Iran's Islamic revolution
throughout the Arab world.
   Diplomats in Baghdad say the war also helped unite Iraq and make
it a more efficient nation which will be able to better use its
vast oil resources in the future, despite the tremendous debt and
losses suffered in the 8-year-old war.
   The Iraqis clearly view the humiliation of the Iranian leader as
the main benefit of the war, which killed an estimated 1 million
Iranians and Iraqis.
   ``The most important outcome was not the technical victories we
scored against the Iranian army, but rather the entire defeat of
the ideological foundation on which the Iranian regime is based,''
President Saddam Hussein said in a recent speech.
   ``Khomeinism was not only evil and dangerous to Iraq and the
Arab world but to humanity at large,'' Hussein said in the speech,
which followed Iraqi victories that led to Iran's acceptance of a
cease-fire resolution on July 18.
   A senior Iraqi official called recent developments ``a
watershed'' because Khomeini ``accepted defeat'' and ``the notion
of coexistence with a secular regime, of cooperation on political
boundaries.''
   ``By accepting this in a legal and political sense, it will be
the end of a model'' Khomeini hoped to spread throughout the
region, the official said.
   ``Nobody would imagine that Khomeini would humiliate himself''
by accepting the cease-fire he had long opposed, said the official,
who demanded anonymity. ``We're very happy because he's not going
to be the prophet anymore.''
   Khomeini came to power in 1979 vowing to export his revolution
throught the Islamic world. His call was taken up by Islamic
radicals throughout the Arab world, generating protests and
guerrilla action in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt,
Bahrain, Tunisia and other countries.
   The bloodiest protests occurred in Saudi Arabia, where
Khomeini-inspired fundamentalists briefly seized Islam's holiest
shrine, the Grand Mosque in Mecca, in 1979, and where Iranian
demonstrations led to a bloodbath during the Islamic pilgrimage to
Mecca in 1987.
   Iran responded to the 1987 clashes by demanding the downfall of
Saudi Arabia's own Islamic fundamentalist government, which is
based on mainstream Sunni Islam.
   The strongest factions are in Lebanon, where Iranian-backed
militias have called for creating an Islamic republic.
   Shiite Moslems, the overwhelming majority in Iran, revere the
martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson Hussein in 680, in an
Islamic factional war from which the Sunni and Shiite branches of
the faith developed.
   The Iran-Iraq war itself was preceded by Iranian threats against
Iraq's secular socialist government.
   During the war, Iran hosted a dissident Iraqi
government-in-exile headed by fundamentalist clerics, and it vowed
to pursue the conflict until Hussein and his associates were
toppled.
   Iraqi officials claim they were never worried about a
Khomeini-style revolution in their country. But they took strong
action against pro-Khomeini forces inside their country, which,
like Iran, has a Shiite Moslem majority.
   Shortly before the war broke out in 1980, the Iraqis deported
35,000 ethnic Iranians and executed Ayatollah Baqr al-Sadr, who had
vowed allegiance to Khomeini.It also crushed the pro-Khomeini Dawa
Party.
   Once the war started, Iraq's Shiites remained loyal.

<HEAD>Jordan Will Keep Some Ties With West Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMAL HALABY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan said Friday that its new policy of
distancing itself from affairs in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip to give the PLO a larger role does not mean cutting
its ties to the people there.
   Information Minister Hani Khasawneh noted that Jordan will
continue paying the salaries of teachers and other administrative
officials in the occupied lands and that Palestinians from there
could keep their Jordanian passports.
   Khasawneh stressed that Jordan's decision to give the
Palestinians ``a free hand to deal'' with their 40-year-old issue
``does not mean that we are cutting all links with Palestinians.''
   The Palestinians' right to ``citizenship and a passport ...
could not be changed unless it is the will of its holder,'' the
minister added.
   Jordan said Thursday it was ending a five-year, $1.3 billion
development program for education and other services in the
occupied territories started in 1986. Khasawneh also said that all
joint Jordanian-Palestinian institutions, such as the Jordanian
Parliament, were under review.
   Wahid Jabari, the representative from Hebron on the West Bank
and one of 30 Palestinian members of the 60-member lower house of
Parliament, said ties between Jordan and the occupied lands could
never be completely severed.
   ``Arab summits, international conferences or wishes of some
parties cannot abolish the sacred unity between the two banks,''
Jabari said.
   ``I do not support the Jordanian step to withdraw its
responsibility toward the Palestinian people whatever the reasons
were.''
   Jabari dismissed reports that the 8-month-old uprising against
Israeli military occupation had also fueled feelings against
Jordan's King Hussein.
   ``People there have deep respect and admiration for King Hussein
and his policies,'' he said.
   The territories have been occupied by the Israeli military since
the 1967 Middle East war, when Israel seized the West Bank from
Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Two-thirds of Jordan's 3.5
million population is of Palestinian origin, but carry Jordanian
passports.
   A senior Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Jordan's decision to give the Palestine Liberation
Organization more responsibility in the occupied lands, ``although

<HEAD>Police Arrest 13 More Abortion Foes Who Refuse To Give Names</HEAD>

   Thirteen more anti-abortion demonstrators were
arrested Friday and refused to give their names, raising to more
than 100 the number of abortion foes jailed in a waiting game of
anonymity with authorities.
   A group called Operation Rescue organized the protest outside
the Atlanta SurgiCenter, a clinic where abortions, among other
medical services, are performed.
   The group led a similar protest at the clinic during the
Democratic National Convention on July 19, when 134 were arrested.
   About 96 of the first batch have refused to give their names and
remain in jail, identifying themselves as numbered ``Baby Jane
Does'' and ``Baby John Does'' _ in solidarity, they say, with
aborted fetuses.
   All pleaded innocent to the only charge against them, criminal
trespass, in three days of Municipal Court appearances that ended
Friday.
   Those arrested Friday were charged with giving a false name,
criminal trespass, unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct and are
to appear in court Monday.
   One demonstrator entered the clinic and tried to talk people in
the waiting room out of having abortions, but was ushered out by
employees.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Lowell Patterson said about 75
percent of those jailed vowed to conceal their identities and
remain jailed until their appearances in State Court, if that date
is within the next month or so.
   He said some others would identify themselves in the next few
days and sign $500 recognizance bonds if business or personal
matters required them to leave.
   Court officials say they cannot free unidentified people on bond
because there is no way of keeping track of them or assuring that
they return for scheduled court appearances.
   ``We will continue not to provide our identities to break the
grip which the abortion industry holds over the criminal justice
system in Atlanta,'' said Randall Terry, director of Operation
Rescue.

<HEAD>Columnist Charged Will Illegal Handgun Possession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan, a longtime
proponent of strict handgun control, has been charged with
unauthorized possession of a weapon and ammunition after shooting a
teen-ager who took an unauthorized dip in his backyard pool, court
records show.
   District of Columbia officials denied Friday that they tried to
suppress public knowledge of the charges, even though they had told
reporters no decision had been reached a day after the paperwork
was filed on Wednesday.
   Rowan, 62, allegedly used an unregistered pistol and bullets to
shoot a trespasser in his backyard June 14. The youth suffered a
wrist wound and was treated and released the same day.
   Rowan is scheduled to appear in District of Columbia Superior
Court Monday for arraignment on the misdemeanor possession charges,
according to court records.
   If convicted on both counts, the columnist would face a maximum
penalty of two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   When contacted by a reporter in Reno, Nev., where he was
scheduled to deliver a speech before the National Conference of
State Legislatures, Rowan refused to discuss the legal developments.
   ``My lawyers are doing all the talking. I don't know all the
details yet,'' Rowan said.
   District of Columbia Corporation Counsel Frederick D. Cooke Jr.,
the city's top attorney, contended that an administrative filing
error left him and other top attorneys unaware that the charges had
been filed.
   ``The agreement we reached with Mr. Rowan's attorney was to file
charges next week, since he (Rowan) was out of town,'' said Cooke.
``There was never any intent to deceive the press or the public
about what was going on.''
   Rowan's attorney, Raoul L. Carroll, confirmed Cooke's account of
the matter.
   Questions remained about the city's delays in handling the case.
Rowan was charged nearly six weeks after the incident occurred,
while Cooke acknowledged that the city usually decides whether to
bring charges in such instances within three weeks.
   Rowan was cleared last month of assault charges in the shooting
incident after an investigation by the federal prosecutor's office.
But U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said at the time that he believed
Rowan should be prosecuted for possessing an unregistered handgun.
   Stephens deferred that decision to the city, which normally
handles such cases.
   After the shooting incident, pro-gun groups said Rowan was a
hypocrite for owning a handgun after criticizing the practice
numerous times in his column. Rowan said he obtained the weapon
only after receiving death threats, and was indirectly misinformed
by police about the need to register it.
   The district's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance requires that
all weapons be registered.
   But Rowan told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son,
Carl Jr., a former FBI agent, and that his son was told he did not
have to register the weapon after leaving the bureau.
   Rowan said he heard noises in his back yard, called police, and
then discovered Benjamin Smith, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., and three
other youths by his swimming pool.
   Rowan said he shot Smith after the teen-ager lunged at him.
Smith disputed that, saying he had not threatened the columnist and
had been shot while trying to flee.
   Smith, who was wounded in the wrist, was treated and released
the same day from Georgetown University Hospital. He was charged
with one count of unlawful entry, but prosecutors dropped the
misdemeanor charge in exchange for 40 hours of community service
work.
   ``My lawyer won't let me talk, but there's a lot I'd like to
say,'' Smith said when told Rowan would be charged. Calls to
Smith's attorney were not returned.

   The Treasury Department on Friday said it had
fined a Texas currency dealer $3.01 million in the first civil
penalty imposed in the department's efforts to crack down on money
laundering along the border with Mexico.
   The fine, for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, was levied on
Oscar's Money Exchange of Hidalgo, Texas, and its owner, Oscar
Ortiz Alvarez, and another man, Antonio Franco.
   Franco's organization was accused of laundering $5.56 million
through Oscar's Money Exchange. Federal agents in June 1987 seized
$2.55 million. The remaining $3.01 million was transported to
Mexico by Alvarez and others without filing the necessary forms
with the U.S. Customs Service, the department said.
   The Bank Secrecy Act requires anyone transporting cash of
$10,000 or more outside the country to notify the Customs Service.
   Alvarez, arrested in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday, was charged in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas with
money laundering.
   The department said Franco is serving 35 years in a federal
prison after being convicted of participating in a drug smuggling
and distribution ring.

<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. says it has no policy of pulling
its editorial punches on Edwin Meese, even though two major
Knight-Ridder newspapers have blocked editorial cartoons critical
of the attorney general as he nears a decision crucial to the
publishing company's bottom line.
   Editors at the Detroit Free Press and The Miami Herald
acknowledge that they decided against running some cartoons about
Meese while he was considering a proposed agreement by which the
Free Press and the Detroit News, a Gannett newspaper, would merge
business functions while remaining editorially separate.
   But other Knight-Ridder editors across the country said they are
not preoccupied with Meese's pending decision. In fact, one of the
papers described Meese in an editorial as ``a boob.''
   The editors also said they have received no corporate directive
on the issue.
   The partner in the Detroit deal, Gannett Co. Inc., said it has
not tried to guide its papers on covering Meese. ``We have not, and
do not, offer guidance to our papers on editorial matters,''
Charles Overby, Gannett vice president for news, said Thursday.
   Louis A. Weil III, publisher of Gannett's Detroit News, said the
pending Meese decision has not affected his newspaper's editorial
page content.
   Larry Jinks, senior vice president for news and operations at
Knight-Ridder's corporate headquarters in Miami, said Thursday that
corporate interference in editorial coverage would be out of
character for the newspaper group, winner of multiple Pulitzer
prizes and owner of 30 daily newspapers in 16 states.
   ``I don't tell people what to put on their editorial pages,'' he
said. ``It's a fundamental article of faith that we don't dictate
editorial page policy from the corporate level.''
   Meese has agreed to decide, before he leaves office next month,
the fate of an application from Knight-Ridder and Gannett to merge
the business functions of the two Detroit newspapers.
   Under the Newspaper Preservation Act, the attorney general has
the power to grant special antitrust exemptions to failing
newspapers by eliminating competition for advertising, as long as
each paper preserves its editorial independence.
   Miami Herald Editor Jim Hampton said he decided to ask Herald
cartoonist Jim Morin not to draw cartoons about Meese while the
decision is considered. Hampton said he has confined the
newspaper's commentary on Meese to the written word rather than
political cartoons, because ``a cartoon can't say `on the other
hand.' ''
   Free Press Editor Joe Stroud, who decided against running
several cartoons by staff cartoonist Bill Day, has said, ``We're
walking through a situation in which you can't deal with things as
freely as you can with a situation in which there is no vested
interest.'' Stroud noted the Free Press has carried Meese
editorials at ``all the key points'' during the period in which
Meese has fought allegations of financial improprieties and
unethical behavior.
   Another Knight-Ridder newspaper, the San Jose Mercury News, has
published nine editorials on Meese and a dozen Meese cartoons since
the beginning of the year. The cartoons about Meese were often
uncomplimentary, and one depicted the Justice Department as a
dilapidated, rat-infested building.
   Bob Stiff, editor of The Tallahassee (Fla.) Democrat, said his
paper has run numerous cartoons and editorials about Meese, ``all
critical of him.''
   Both The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News,
Knight-Ridder papers, have been critical of Meese in editorials and
editorial cartoons in 1988 and neither has withheld cartoons on the
attorney general, according to editorial page editors.
   Don Harrison, deputy editor for the editorial pages at the
Philadelphia Daily News, said the paper has run eight editorials
highly critical of Meese, including one referring to the attorney
general as a ``boob.''
   The Seattle Times' editorial page editor, Herb F. Robinson, said
his paper's coverage of Meese is ``no holds barred'' and has gotten
no corporate directives.
   ``I think I'd go to the wall on something like that,'' he said.
``An editorial cartoon isn't supposed to be fair.''
   Lloyd Gray, editorial page editor of the Sun Herald in Biloxi,
Miss., said he runs the work of three syndicated cartoonists, and
two have done fairly regular cartoons about Meese.
   ``We've taken the position he's not done a good job of keeping
out of trouble. We'll continue to make our judgments on things
entirely unrelated to (the Detroit decision),'' Gray said.
   Jack Swift, editor of The Columbus (Ga.) Ledger-Enquirer, has
not pulled Meese cartoons either.
   ``We have no such policy,'' Swift said. ``We've had no
communication or conversation with anyone from Knight-Ridder about
it, and we're doing basically what we feel is best for our
readers.''

<HEAD>Candidate Loses Auto Workers' Support For Admitting He Owns
Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM MITZELFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state House candidate who drove his
imported car to a United Auto Workers meeting has only himself to
blame for losing the endorsements of Michigan's two major labor
groups, a union spokesman says.
   David Rutledge, of Ypsilanti, complained earlier this week that
House Speaker Gary Owen coerced leaders of the Michigan State
AFL-CIO to support his hand-picked successor, Kirk Profit, over
Rutledge in a primary election despite a decision by the group's
local members to remain neutral.
   But Tim Hughes, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, said Rutledge's
admission to a UAW local screening committee that he owns a Subaru
and his wife drives a Mercedes killed any chance he had of winning
labor support.
   ``That's the first thing they do is look out the window and see
what you drive,'' Hughes said, chuckling.
   ``Somebody who thinks that little of workers in their district
that they're driving a foreign car is not going to get their
endorsement,'' Hughes said, insisting that Owen's preference never
came into play.
   ``If God himself endorsed (Rutledge), and he drove up in a
Subaru, he's not getting our endorsement,'' Hughes added.
   Rutledge said he's not surprised the union is using his choice
of cars against him, but he has borrowed an American-made car for
the rest of the campaign.
   ``If that's the only thing that Owen and company can find in
terms of a negative about David Rutledge, I accept that.''
   He said that if driving is an issue, perhaps voters should
consider that his opponent, Profit, has been arrested for drunken
driving. ``At least I can say I've never been caught drunk driving
in either one of my cars,'' he said.
   Profit and Rutledge will face off in next Tuesday's Democratic
primary for the right to take on the Republican winner in November.
   Political action committees for the Michigan UAW and AFL-CIO
have each contributed $2,500 to Profit's campaign.
   Owen's decision not to seek a ninth term in the House prompted
his two former staffers to compete for his seat.
   Profit, 35, served four years as assistant majority director of
House Democrats. He is a former undersheriff in Wayne County.
   Rutledge, 43, was recruited by Owen two years ago as deputy
director of the House Democratic Research Staff.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Up 3.6 Percent For Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products in July
rose 3.6 percent from June as drought continued to take a toll of
crop and livestock production, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that higher prices for corn, soybeans and eggs
contributed most to the July increase. Lower prices for oranges,
cattle and hogs partly offset the rise in other commodities.
   Compared with a year earlier, July prices averaged 10 percent
higher. The report also included revised figures showing that the
index rose only 2.2 percent in June, compared with the preliminary
reading of 3.7 percent announced a month ago.
   Department projections earlier this month showed that 1988 grain
production may be reduced by 24 percent from last year. Heat and
drought have dried up pastures and forced many producers to thin
out herds to cut down on rising feed costs.
   Prices of some major commodities are based on mid-month averages
and then are revised the following month when additional
information is available.
   John Buche of the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service said the July report did not reflect most of the recent
downturn in feed grain and soybean prices after rains improved
harvest prospects from earlier in the month.
   However, the market continued to be highly volatile. At the
Chicago Board of Trade on Friday, crop futures soared after falling
for nine straight sessions as processors and other users came into
the market.
   By the market's close, most corn and soybean futures had risen
their respective daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents per bushel,
while the limitless August contract for soybeans soared more than
34 cents.
   The USDA report, which uses prices at the farm level, showed
that as a commodity group, prices of feed grains and hay _ in great
demand for livestock in the stricken drought areas _ rose 16
percent from June to July, averaging 71 percent above a year ago.
   Prices of food grains, mostly wheat but also including rice,
rose 2.9 percent during the month and averaged 54 percent more than
in July 1987.
   Oil-bearing crops, mostly soybeans, were up 8.5 percent from
June and averaged 57 percent more than a year ago, the report said.
   Overall the July all-crops price index was up 7.1 percent from
June, averaging 26 percent above the year-ago level.
   The July livestock price index was unchanged from June but was
down 0.7 percent from July 1987. Lower prices for cattle and hogs
were offset by higher prices for eggs, broilers and turkeys.
   Prices of cattle and calves continued to edge lower, partly due
to many farmers and ranchers being forced by drought to sell
animals to slaughter plants or feedlots.
   Beef cattle, generally, fell to an average of $63.60 per
hundredweight in July, down $1.40 from June.
   The price index for poultry and eggs, collectively, rose 19
percent from June to July and averaged 32 percent more than a year
ago.
   Although the projections are subject to review as more is known
about 1988 crop and livestock production, USDA economists say now
that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $53 billion
to $59 billion this year, down from the record level of $56 billion
in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash
expenses during the calendar year.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
Before the drought took hold, USDA was predicting a 1988 food price
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
   Department officials have predicted that the drought may add 2
percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected
increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That
could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to
7 percent.
   The report also included new quarterly figures showing that farm
production costs in July were up 2.4 percent from April, averaging
4.9 percent more than in July 1987. Higher prices for feed and
gasoline were only partially offset by lower prices for feeder
livestock.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $63.605.20 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, down from $65 in June but up from $61.10 reported for
July 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $44.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $47.10 in
June and $59.60 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.89 a bushel, was up from $2.41 in June and the
average of $1.60 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.46 per bushel, compared with $3.36 in June and $2.32 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.35 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.29 in June
and $3.49 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $8.87 per bushel, compared with $8.14 in June and
$5.25 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 60.7 cents per pound, compared
with 61.2 in June and 68.3 cents in July 1987.
   _Eggs were 57.8 cents per dozen, compared with 45.7 cents in
June and 50.3 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $11.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $11.30 in June
and $12 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 42.1 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
36.7 cents in June and 27.6 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>Senate Votes To Increase Spending on Nutrition Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Friday approved a $31 million
increase in the government's nutrition program for women, infants
and children as part of a $47 billion measure to pay for
agriculture, nutrition and rural development programs for the year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The lawmakers voted 87-4 to boost money for the popular WIC
program as they worked through a list of amendments to the overall
spending measure, and made up the cost by trimming spending from a
whole spectrum of farm programs.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who proposed the increase, said
it would provide benefits to nearly 100,000 eligible poor women and
children who now are left out of the program because of funding
limits.
   The bill would provide about $1.9 billion for the WIC program
for the coming year, an increase of about $125 million over the
current year's level, and $31 million more than had been
recommended by the Appropriations Committee for next year.
   To stay within spending limits for the overall bill, the
increase in WIC was paid for with a 0.7 percent across-the-board
cut on farm programs in the bill.
   DeConcini argued that while the program provides food
supplements to about 3.6 million low-income pregnant and nursing
mothers and young children, at least that many more are not served
because the program is underfunded.
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., the senior GOP member on the
agriculture Appropriations subcommittee, argued against the change,
noting that participation in the program has grown 79 percent since
1980 and that it already ``is funded in a very generous way.'' He
said it would be unfair to other farm programs to impose further
cuts in order to boost WIC spending.
   The WIC program is popular _ particularly in an election year _
because it targets one of the most vulnerable groups in the
population and by providing preventive care helps save money on
later health-care costs. It provides packages of fortified infant
formula, milk, cereal, cheese, eggs and fruit juices through local
health clinics.
   The money bill, passed on a 74-8 final vote, now goes to a
House-Senate conference committee to work out differences between
the Senate version and one passed by the House on June 16. The
House bill makes available $3 billion less than the Senate version.
   Among differences between the two versions is a House provision
putting a $250,000 cap on loans to honey producers, some of whom
collect large federal payments for selling their surplus honey to
the government. The Senate dropped that provision from its bill.
   The Reagan administration is opposed to the overall spending
bill on numerous grounds, and the president's top advisers have
vowed to recommend a veto if it is not changed before being sent to
the White House.
   Among its objections, the administration lists a provision that
requires the government to base its cost-benefit calculations for
irrigation projects on the subsidized value of surplus crops that
will be grown on the irrigated land, rather than the value of the
crops before subsidies.
   The requirement produces a double subsidy problem which the
administration has been trying to eliminate, according to a
statement from the Office of Management and Budget.
   The bill also reinstates a list of programs the administration
has sought to eliminate, including rural housing loans and grants
and agricultural research and extension programs.
   Among its provisions, the Senate bill makes available:
   _$12.5 billion for farm programs, including crop subsidies, crop
insurance, agricultural research and extension.
   _$12.4 billion in rural development programs, including Farmers
Home Administration loans, reimbursements to the Rural
Electrification Administration and soil conservation programs.
   _$16.2 billion for domestic food assistance, including $13.4
billion for the food stamp program, $4.6 billion for child
nutrition and $50 million for the Temporary Emergency Food
Assistance Program.
   _$1.2 billion for foreign programs including Food for Peace and
subsidies to encourage exports of U.S. agricultural products.
   _$534 million for the Food and Drug Administration and $35.5
million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

<HEAD>To Review Cases of People Imprisoned During Anti-communist
Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cases of about 400 people
imprisoned during the 1956 anti-Communist uprising that was crushed
by Soviet tanks will be reviewed by the end of August, a Justice
Ministry official said Friday.
   The reviews could lead to amnesty and permission to travel
abroad for some of the 400.
   But Jenoe Laszlo, head of the ministry's legislation drafting
department, also was quoted by the newspaper Magyar Nemzet as
saying those who were convicted of high treason or espionage for
their acts between Oct. 23, 1956, and May 1, 1957 would be excluded
from the planned amnesty.
   Laszlo said amnesty would not be considered for those convicted
of committing common crimes such as homicide, robbery and ``acts
causing danger to the public'' during that period, the newspaper
reported.
   The revolt began in October 1956 with demonstrations demanding a
new government and that Soviet troops leave Hungary. On Nov. 4,
1956, about 4.2 million Soviet troopers and 2,500 tanks struck at
Budapest.
   Karoly Grosz, premier and Communist Party leader, said last week
during a U.S. visit that his government was preparing a measure to
remove travel restrictions for those sentenced for having played a
role in the uprising. He said the proposal could affect 400 people.
   Police can deny exit visas to people who have a criminal record.
   Hungarians generally have greater freedom of travel under
regulations approved Jan. 1. They allow passport holders to travel
to the West as often as they can afford within the country's
currency restrictions.
   Seven dissidents went on a hunger strike last week, however, to
protest what they said were arbitrary decisions by police over who
receives a passport. Most of the hunger strikers have been refused
permission to travel abroad for allegedly violating Hungarian
regulations on previous trips.
   Jenoe Fonay, one of the hunger strikers, was involved in the
1956 revolt and could be affected by the new ruling.
   Grosz said that among the cases to be reconsidered would be
those of people who had been refused amnesty earlier because of
political affiliation with the leaders of the 1956 uprising.
   But Grosz has steadfastly ruled out rehabilitation of the
leaders of the revolt, including Imre Nagy who was the Communist
Party leader at the time. His trial and execution were announced in
1958.
   Laszlo said those who were sentenced to five-year prison terms
or less following the uprising were given amnesties after their
release in the late 1950s or early 1960s.
   Those who served more than five years will have to apply for the
invalidation of their criminal record, he said.
   About 20,000 people jailed during and after the revolt were
released in a general amnesty in 1962.

   Michael Dukakis accused the Reagan
administration Friday of permitting the Pentagon's procurement
scandal and said if he is elected ``we're not going to surrender
our national security to greed and corruption.''
   ``We're not going to use our defense dollars to line the pockets
of Washington consultants,'' the Democtratic presidential nominee
said.
   Dukakis, visiting the state where he suffered the worst
embarrassment of his primary campaign, toured a General Motors
truck assembly plant to underscore his pledge to work for ``full
employment'' and his call for private and government investment in
modernizing industry and creating new jobs.
   He also met with Jesse Jackson supporters who had helped Jackson
win the state last spring. He got outspoken backing from one key
figure.
   At the GM plant, where Chevrolet and GMC light trucks are
manufactured, Dukakis walked along the assembly line to shake hands
with workers. He climbed behind the wheel of a new red, four-wheel
drive truck and drove it off the assembly line, carrying with him
United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber and Michigan's two
senators, Carl Levin and Don Riegle.
   As he had done in other cities a day earlier, Dukakis met
privately with leaders of Jackson's former campaign _ an
organization that produced a two-to-one Jackson victory over
Dukakis in Michigan's hybrid caucus system.
   ``I want them; I need them; I want them to be a part of not only
a great campaign but what I hope will be a great administration,''
Dukakis said.
   He met twice with Joel Furguson, Jackson's former Michigan state
chairman, who voiced support for the Dukakis-Lloyd Bentsen ticket.
``Our entire organization is ready to plug in and go,'' Ferguson
said.
   The candidate also met with the state's top Democrats, including
Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, one of the few black elected leaders
who backed Dukakis over Jackson in the primaries.
   Dukakis, speaking to 500 people outside another GM plant, where
Buicks are assembled, cited the report on Pentagon procurement
practices conducted for the administration by a commission headed
by David Packard. He said the report indicated the Reagan
administration had helped create a climate where ``honest and
efficient military acquisition is impossible.''
   ``In a Dukakis administration, we're not going to surrender our
national security to greed and corruption,'' Dukakis said.
   In the plant, Dukakis was greeted warmly by workers and
presented a maroon jacket with the UAW name and ``Duke for
President'' embroidered on the back.
   ``We want good jobs and these are the kinds of jobs we want for
the people of this country, to make our industrial base and
manufacturing industries competitive again,'' he said.
   The rally was in the same town where another GM auto assembly
was closed within the past year, leaving more than 3,000 people out
of work. Both Jackson and another primary rival, Rep. Richard
Gephardt, had traveled to that closed Flint plant for speeches last
spring.
   Asked what hope he could offer the laid-off workers, Dukakis
cited his plan to spend half a billion dollars investing in
economic development in distressed regions of the country.
   Dukakis repeated his criticism of the administration's handling
of Pentagon contracts later in Sturtevant, Wis., where he toured a
plant that makes metal casings for auto transmissions and other
machinery.
   Dukakis repeated his criticism of the administration's handling
of Pentagon contracts later in Sturtevant, Wisc., where he toured a

machinery,
   Dukakis spoke to about 300 people in the parking lot of the
Wisconsin plant, where he said that bringing labor and management
together will be a ``major challenge to me if I'm president.''
   About 25 anti-abortion and other demonstrators chanted protest
slogans for much of his speech.

<TEXT>
   ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' the
critically praised series dropped by NBC for low ratings, is moving
next year to the Lifetime Cablevision Network, Lifetime announced
Friday.
   ``Molly Dodd'' was nominated Thursday for three Emmy Awards,
including Blair Brown for best lead actress in a comedy.
   Pat Fili, Lifetime's senior vice president of programming,
called ``Molly Dodd'' ``the perfect show for us.'' Lifetime is
geared toward female viewers. ``Molly Dodd'' is a bittersweet
comedy about a divorced woman in her late 30s living in New York.
   ``We expect this show will flourish in its move from network to
its new home on cable where the talent will have more creative
freedom and less restrictions,'' said Fili.
   In January, Lifetime will begin airing the 26 episodes already
produced and has contracted for 13 new episodes that will begin
running in the spring.
   The acquisition marks the first time since the USA Network
continued production of ``Airwolf'' two years ago that cable has
continued production on a show canceled by a network.
   Lifetime's purchase of ``Molly'' is significant in view of the
decline in network ratings and higher cable viewership.
   Jay Tarses, the creator and executive producer of the show, said
he was thrilled that the show would stay in production.
   ``Lifetime is doing something that could be very revolutionary,
could signal a new age in television for the creative community,''
said Tarses. ``It's another place to go, and there should be other
places to go, because this is a show that a lot of people wanted to
watch and the network said there just weren't enough people.''
   Tarses had been critical of NBC Entertainment President Brandon
Tartikoff's taste in programming after NBC moved the show around
the schedule and complained about its low ratings. But Tarses
avoided criticizing Tartikoff anew.
   ``I think he's one of the most intelligent men in the United
States,'' Tarses said, getting a big laugh from TV critics
attending the news conference.
   ``I said some things when all this was going on at NBC because I
was very upset about what had happened, but it all had to do with
the emotion of the moment,'' he said.
   Tarses also produced ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story'' on ABC. It was
dropped after a season. An earlier Tarses co-production, ``Buffalo
Bill,'' became a cult hit in reruns on cable. It too received
critical praise on the network, but was canceled due to low ratings.
   Tarses said he had to be convinced that a move to cable was
worthwhile, but is now sold on the idea.
   ``This could be the answer for people like me,'' he said.
``Maybe cable is exactly where we should be. `Frank's Place' (on
CBS) got nine Emmy nominations, but last week it was 72 (in the
Nielsen rankings).
   ``I don't want `Molly' to die, and this looks like genuine life
to me.''
   Tarses said the show would be produced in New York instead of
Los Angeles and that production would resume in January. The show
is unaffected by the writers' strike because the production company
has an independent contract with the Writers Guild.
   Tarses said Brown was shooting a movie in London and he had not
talked to her but ``I think she feels the same way I do'' about
moving the show to cable.

   An organization of Iranian guerrillas fighting
to overthrow Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Friday it had held
two towns in Iran for three days this week and killed or wounded
40,000 troops loyal to Khomeini.
   The National Liberation Army of Iran is now withdrawing from the
towns of Islamadab and Karand, southwest of Tehran, said Dr. Aladin
Pouran, a representative of the year-old organization.
   In three days of fighting, the NLA forces caused 40,000
casualties, and shot down two F-4 Phantom jets and two Cobra
helicopter gunships, Pouran told a news conference.
   ``Heavy fighting continued incessantly until Friday morning
between NLA forces and Khomeini's Revolutionary Guards at different
points along the front, from the border region to the
Islamabad-Kermanshah highway,'' Pouran said.
   Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman called
for restraint by all parties in the conflict.
   He said the NLA, formed in June 1987 as the military arm of the
Mojaheddin, operates with the support of Iraq and seeks the violent
overthrow of the Iranian government.
   ``Our view is that peace will require that both sides refrain
from interfering in the internal affairs of the other,'' Redman
said.
   Once again, the spokesman sidestepped questions about Iraq's
insistence on direct negotiations with Iran.
   ``Both sides have indicated that they seek a negotiated
settlement, but getting there is going to require patience and
flexibility,'' he said. ``We have been in close contact with the
(United Nations) Secretary-General and with members of the Security
Council to lend our support to this process, and will continue to
do that.''

   Vice President George Bush's decision against
addressing the National Urban League next week is a ``serious
miscalculation'' that could hurt him among black voters, the
president of the group said Friday.
   ``I believe it is a critical error on the part of the Bush
campaign to not come and address this group,'' John E. Jacob said.
``We did not offer the invitation because we needed someone to come
fill up a slot. We can get speakers to come to the Urban League.''
   The 5,000 largely middle class and affluent blacks gathering for
the league's annual conference will hear from Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis on Monday night and from Jesse
Jackson on Wednesday.
   New York Congressman Jack Kemp, who sought the GOP nomination
until Bush plled away from the field during the primaries, is part
of a Tuesday night panel discussion on the 1988 election.
   ``I would not care to characterize it as an insult,'' Jacob said
of the Bush campaign's action. ``We believe it is important to
anyone who in 1988 believes that he will occupy the White House to
recognize that the black vote is critical to that. Obviously the
people who were advising the vice president and the vice president
himself disagree with that.''
   Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for Bush's campaign in Washington,
did not return two phone calls seeking comment.
   Jacob said the profile of the average league member _
characterized as a 34-to-54 year old college-educated black,
earning at least $30,000 a year _ made the league a good forum for
a GOP candidate. The league itself is non-partisan.
   ``You've got to appreciate the profile because if there are any
black folks in America who just might be sensitive to giving an
audience to the vice president, it would be a group with this
profile,'' Jacob said. ``The fact that they do not have an
appreciation for this profile not only sends a message to this
group but it sends even a greater message to the group that doesn't
fit that profile.''
   ``It's in his best interest to present his case to black
America,'' Jacob said. ``The fact that he obviously feels he can
get elected without it I think is a serious miscalculation on his
part.''

Unfairly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A human rights lawyer accused the Justice
Department Friday of setting up Mariel Cuban detainees for unfair
treatment with a proposal that immigration judges be allowed to
ignore evidence of persecution in some asylum cases.
   Arthur Helton, director of the Political Asylum Project of the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, said the proposal appears to be
an effort to expedite denial of asylum to the Mariel Cubans, many
of whom have criminal records in the United States.
   Under the proposed regulation, judges would not need to inquire
into the nature of a ``well-founded fear of persecution'' in the
home country of an asylum applicant who had committed a
``particularly serious crime'' in the United States.
   The Justice Department says the serious crimes include murder,
drug trafficking, armed robbery and rape.
   But Helton said refugees with U.S. convictions for burglary,
weapons possession, simple assault and marijuana possession could
be affected too. Helton is director of the Political Asylum Project
of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   About 2,600 Cubans, mostly criminals and mental patients, sent
by Cuban leader Fidel Castro in a 1980 boatlift from the port of
Mariel are detained in the United States. Nearly 1,500 are being
held in federal prisons, said Rick Kenney, a spokesman for the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``The real target of this proposal seems to be the Cuban
Marielitos who remain in immigration custody,'' said Helton. ``The
Justice Department wants to expedite the denial of any asylum
applications filed by the Cubans, many of whom have criminal
histories in the United States, so that they can be deported
quickly back to Cuba.''
   The proposal is ``absolutely not targeted at'' the Mariel
Cubans, although ``it would have application to some Mariels,''
said Steven R. Valentine, a deputy assistant attorney general in
the Justice Department's civil division.
   The regulation was prompted by an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals opinion, not by the prospect of Mariel Cubans seeking
asylum, Valentine said.
   ``The basic purpose is the prevention of unnecessary delays in
the removal of all aliens regardless of nationality who have
committed particularly serious crimes,'' said Valentine.
   The cases of the 2,600 Cubans are being reviewed by the INS to
determine whether to release them or to detain them.
   About 70 Cuban detainees have been served with deportation
notices, said Gary Leshaw, a lawyer in Atlanta who has represented
many of the Mariel Cubans. Filing an asylum application is one step
to avoid being repatriated to a home country.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 31 that under
an existing Justice Department regulation, asylum applicants are
entitled to present their evidence and to have their claim of
persecution considered by immigration judges in deportation and
exclusion proceedings, despite the fact that the applicants may
have serious criminal convictions.
   The new proposal, which is open for public comment until Aug.
26, would close that opportunity.
   The 11th circuit case, Arauz versus Rivkind, involved a
Nicaraguan man who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with
intent to distribute marijuana. He had been arrested aboard a
fishing vessel carrying more than 4,000 pounds of marijuana.
   The proposal also would cover refugees with a well-founded fear
of persecution who have participated in the persecution of others
or who pose a danger to the security of the United States.
   The proposal is part of a comprehensive rule-making which
involves revamping asylum procedures in line with a 1987 Supreme
Court ruling, INS versus Cardoza-Fonseca. The Justice Department
plans to complete the comprehensive rule-making later.

   With mixed feelings of warmth and caution, Moscow
Jews welcomed the first Israeli diplomats to visit the Soviet Union
in 21 years to Sabbath prayers at sundown Friday.
   ``Shalom!'' shouted the burly, bearded delegation head, Meron
Gordon, as he and the five other Israelis met a crowd of 60 Jews
and reporters outside Moscow's Choral Synagogue.
   The Soviet Jews replied with shouts of shalom, a Hebrew word
that means both hello and peace.
   The diplomats, four of them Soviet-born, flew to Moscow Thursday
for a two-month visit. They are to inspect the former Israeli
Embassy in Moscow and review the Dutch Embassy's processing of
requests by Soviet Jews for Israeli visas.
   It is the first such mission to the Soviet Union since 1967,
when the Kremlin broke relations with the Jewish state to protest
Israel's occupation of Arab territories in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Inside the synagogue, Gordon, 41, who emigrated from the Soviet
Union in 1957, chatted in Hebrew with the Soviet Union's chief
rabbi, Adolf Shayevich.
   ``This is really special for us,'' Gordon told journalists.
``Every synagogue for us is the crucial point, the crossroads where
the Jewish community meets.''
   He and the other Israelis, wearing the traditional skullcap, the
yarmulke, took seats for Sabbath prayers.
   Many of the Soviet Jews said they learned of the planned visit
to the synagogue from radio newscasts on Voice of America and from
Israel.
   Several Soviet Jews outside the synagogue on central Moscow's
Arkhipova Street told reporters Friday night that they want to
emigrate.
   A 28-year-old man who identified himself only as Arya said he
had ``warm feelings'' toward the Israeli visitors, but was
concerned they had come in part to enforce a new Israeli policy
limiting the options of Jews who want to leave.
   The Israeli Cabinet ordered a change in procedure in June that
would force most emigrating Soviet Jews to go to Israel. Under
current rules, most emigres can choose where they want to resettle,
and most go to the United States.
   Arya said he just received Soviet permission to emigrate with
his wife and 2-year-old daughter, and might prefer some other
country than Israel in which to settle.
   Boris Chernobylsky, a prominent refusenik, or Soviet Jew refused
permission to emigrate, told a reporter he doubted the Israeli
diplomats would push for freer emigration.
   ``They are afraid of Soviet authorities and want to please
them,'' he said.
   Shayevich, who some Jews say is under the tutelage of the
government, told reporters he believes most Soviet Jews who want to
leave have already emigrated. He said the Soviet government has a
legitimate right to force people to stay if they had access to
classified material.
   From January to June, 6,017 Soviet Jews emigrated. Last year,
the Soviet Union allowed 8,011 Jews to leave.
   The rabbi said he hoped the Israeli mission would lead
eventually to restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet
Union.
   The Kremlin says it won't restore ties until Israel withdraws
from the occupied lands and agrees to an international Mideast
peace conference.

   There were 107.9 million head of cattle on the
nation's farms and ranches as of July 1, the lowest count since
mid-year inventories were started in 1973, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   The latest total was down 1 percent from 109.5 million head a
year earlier and 4 percent fewer than the 112.2 million of two
years ago.
   Although drought has forced some producers to thin out herds
because of poor forage supplies and high feed costs, the cattle
herd has been shrinking for six years.
   Last Jan. 1, for example, the inventory dropped to 99 million
head, a 27-year low and the first time that the Jan. 1 count had
been less than 100 million since 1961.
   Officials said the 1988 calf crop is expected to be about 40.2
million head, up fractionally from 1987 but down 2 percent from
1986.
   The July 1 inventory of 107.9 million head _ which includes
calves and dairy cattle as well as beef stock _ included these
categories, compared with the last two years, respectively:
   _Beef cows, 33.8 million head, down 1 percent from both July 1,
1987, and 1986.
   _Milk cows, 10.3 million, down 1 percent from last year and 6
percent below two years ago.
   _All heifers, 500 pounds and over, 16.5 million, down 3 percent
from last year and 6 percent from two years ago.
   _Beef replacement heifers, 4.8 million, unchanged from both
years.
   _Milk replacement heifers, 4.4 million, down 4 percent from 1987
and down 6 percent from 1986.
   _Other heifers, 7.3 million, down 4 percent from 1987 and down 9
percent from 1986.
   _Steers weighing 500 pounds and over, 14.5 million, down 2
percent from last year and down 5 percent from 1986.
   _Bulls weighing 500 pounds and over, 2.2 million, unchanged from
both years.
   _Calves under 500 pounds, 30.7 million, down 1 percent from 1987
and down 5 percent from 1986.

   Farmers who have grain price support loans
coming due on July 31 will have an option to extend them to Aug.
31, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Officials said the action was taken as a result of a preliminary
injunction issued July 21 by U.S. District Court Judge Harry H.
MacLaughlin in St. Paul, Minn. However, they left the door open for
a possible appeal of the court's order.
   The court order barred the secretary of agriculture from
implementing notices issued by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service to county offices concerning
the extension of loans and whether or not certain commodities would
be eligible for storage in the agency's farmer-owned reserve
program.

department's Commodity Credit Corp., said all terms and conditions
of the individual contracts will remain the same.
   Producers who have reserve contracts, special storage loan
contracts and 1985 and 1986 extended loan contracts will continue
to earn storage payments through Aug. 31, he said. The payments for
the additional month's storage will be made when farmers settle
their loans.
   Meanwhile, Bedenbaugh said USDA and the Justice Department are
``examining possible courses of action which could be taken in this
litigation.''
   He said the one-month extension of all loans was ``to alleviate
any confusion among producers and in the commodity markets'' that
might have been caused by the court's injunction.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen said Friday that Republican George Bush had been slow
to recognize the need for more child care, but he also said the
vice president's proposal on the subject was ``a step in the right
direction.''
   That was a kinder verdict than Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis gave during a news conference while campaigning in
Wisconsin. Dukakis said of Bush's proposal, ``I don't know of
anyone who is seriously concerned about child care who thinks that
makes sense.''
   Bentsen flew back to his native Texas to complete a three-day
campaign swing, his first solo tour since receiving his nomination
last week at the Democratic National Convention. With a rally and
news conference in Amarillo, he was campaigning hard on the home
turf of his Senate-race opponent, Rep. Beau Boulter.
   He told reporters he was going ``full bore'' on both of his
candidacies and intended to spend all the money he raised for his
Senate race on that contest, despite Republican complaints that it
was unfair. Texas law allows Bentsen to run for both offices at
once.
   Earlier Friday, Bentsen visited a state-subsidized day care
center at the UCLA campus, posing with pre-schoolers and listening
to parents' and employees' questions about why there was not more
federal day care help.
   One mother getting her degree in education told him that her
``whole eight years of education is more or less down the drain''
until her child is old enough to go to school, since she won't be
able to afford day care once she leaves the campus program.
   ``We're beginning to make some headway. We're really beginning
to see some attention given to this issue,'' Bentsen said, citing
his involvement last year in creating a commission to study
children's issues in Congress.
   Bentsen told reporters afterward that the Reagan administration
had fought him last year when he earmarked $50 million for federal
day care subsidies to local government. He said Bush's $2.2 billion
proposal amounted to a ``conversion.''
   ``I think the Bush proposal is a step in the right direction and
I'm delighted to see them get aboard on this issue,'' said Bentsen,
who as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee reviews any changes
in tax law. ``They have not been very supportive of these kinds of
efforts over the past eight years.''
   Asked if he supported the Bush plan's tax credits to mothers who
stay home with their children, Bentsen declined to comment, saying
he wasn't familiar with the details. He pointed out that Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., had drafted a competing plan with
subsidies and standards for day care centers.
   Dukakis has said he supports the Senate Democrats' legislation
in principle.
   The UCLA center, available for students and employees of the
university, is heavily subsidized with parents paying part or none
of the cost depending on their income. The center has an annual
budget of $650,000 and there are 77 youngsters enrolled, said
administrator David Menninger.
   The most a parent pays is $440 a month, which is less than
two-thirds the cost for care at the center which is just off Sunset
Blvd.
   Bentsen predicted Congress would eventually approve a blend of
the different child care proposals, including some tax credits and
some subsidies.
   Sen. and Mrs. Bentsen, who have three children and five
grandchildren, spent about 15 minutes with the children, some of
whom were frightened by the media commotion. Others seemed to enjoy
the scene.
   The 67-year-old Texas Democrat, dressed in a suit suitable for
the Senate chamber, bounced a boy on his knee, telling him
``Ride-em, Cowboy.'' He also got close-up looks at a wide variety
of plastic dinosaurs.
   On another subject, Bentsen, who is chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, praised Nicholas Brady who has been widely
reported as the next Treasury secretary if and when James Baker III
leaves that job to take over as Bush's campaign chairman.
   Bentsen said he expected there would be little opposition to
Brady, whose nomination would have to be cleared by his committee.
   Though Baker is still in his job and no nomination of Brady has
been announced, Bentsen spoke as if the changes had been put in
motion.
   ``I think that's a good choice,'' he said. ``Nick served in the
United States Senate. He was appointed to that job and served there
a few months, made a lot of friends. I'm very pleased to see the
choice. He's a man who has broad experience in the area and I think
will bring a lot to the job.''

   A cancer patient who said he must smoke
marijuana to avoid starvation was convicted Friday of possessing 7{
ounces of marijuana, but jurors fined him only $1 and ordered no
jail time.
   The Johnson District Court jury followed the recommendation of
Assistant County Attorney Tom Blaha, who had urged them to show
compassion.
   The maximum penalty that could have been levied was 90 days in
jail and a $250 fine.
   The trial that began Thursday was the first time a cancer
patient has mounted a medical defense against a marijuana charge,
although people suffering from glaucoma and other disorders have
done so, said Kevin Zeese, a lawyer for the Drug Policy Foundation,
based in Washington, D.C.
   Rick Morris, 31, was a truck driver who weighed nearly 200
pounds in March 1987 when doctors detected a large tumor wrapped
around his brain stem, said Ned Pillersdorf, Morris' attorney.
   His weight dropped below 125 pounds by the time therapy
concluded, he said. Until Morris began smoking marijuana, even the
smell of food would cause him to vomit, Pillersdorf said.
   ``After the radiation and chemotherapy stopped, things were
getting worse instead of better,'' Pillersdorf told jurors. ``When
he made a decision to smoke marijuana, he made a decision to save
his life.''
   Morris was arrested in November after officers saw a bag of
marijuana on a table at his apartment when they responded to a
medical emergency there, Blaha said.
   Officers returned later with a search warrant and confiscated 7{
ounces of marijuana, some pills and marijuana paraphernalia, Blaha
said.
   A defense witness from the Drug Policy Foundation, Daniel
Dansak, a psychiatrist teaching at the University of South Alabama,
told jurors that marijuana is the best drug to help cancer patients
deal with the side effects of radiation treatments and chemotherapy.
   Kentucky is not among the 34 states that have legalized
marijuana for medical purposes. County Attorney Scott Preston said
in May that he did not want to inflict more pain on Morris, ``but
if they want to change the laws, the place to do it is in the
Legislature.''

<HEAD>At Least 15 Die In Sinhalese Violence On 1st Anniversary Of Peace
Pact</HEAD>

   Sinhalese extremists set buses afire
and attacked government buildings Friday, the first anniversary of
a pact intended to end an ethnic war with Tamil rebels. Authorities
said at least 15 people were killed.
   Military officials in Colombo said at least 13 of the dead were
Sinhalese militants shot by police during the attacks in southern
and central Sri Lanka. The officers cannot be identified under
briefing rules.
   Extremists killed a soldier in the Hambantota district of the
south and a civilian was slain in an attack on a tavern, they said..
   Most shops, offices and businesses in Colombo closed Friday
because the owners feared violence, police said.
   A round-the-clock curfew was imposed in the south after
Sinhalese nationalists called for a general strike to protest the
Indian-sponsored accord aimed at ending the Tamil war, which has
taken more than 8,000 lives in five years.
   Residents of Vavuniya, a city about 125 miles northeast of
Colombo, said by telephone that Indian soldiers had put a curfew on
parts of the north and east to guard against attacks by Tamil
separatist guerrillas.
   The main Tamil rebel group and the People's Liberation Front,
extremists from the island's Sinhalese majority, oppose the peace
agreement signed by India and Sri Lanka last July. It offers Tamils
limited autonomy.
   Sinhalese radicals say the deal gives Tamils too many
concessions and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam say it is not
enough.
   When the Tigers continued fighting, India sent soldiers in
October to enforce the agreement. At least 50,000 now are on the
island.
   A firebomb wounded a railroad engineer as his train pulled into
Colombo, a police officer said. He said Sinhalese extremists set at
least eight government buses ablaze.
   Electricity was cut off in at least four southern towns after
the extremists blew up electricity transformers Thursday night,
officials said.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and claim discrimination by the
Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist and control the
government and military.
   India became involved in trying to settle the Tamil war because
it is the region's major power, is an overwhelmingly Hindu nation
and has a Tamil minority of 60 million in southern Tamil Nadu
state, just across the Palk Strait from Sri Lanka.

   The scriptwriters' strike will delay TV Guide
magazine's fall preview issue three weeks, and even then the weekly
magazine's top-selling issue may not be up-to-date, the editor said
Friday.
   ``This may be the year TV Guide does a new-season issue and
there's no new season,'' said Editor Dave Sendler.
   The 21-week strike by scriptwriters has halted Hollywood
production and jeopardized the fall television season. Negotiators
for the scriptwriters and the television and film producers engaged
in contract talks this week under a news blackout.
   Last year's TV Guide fall preview issue sold more than 18
million copies. The magazine, based in suburban Philadelphia, has a
circulation of 16.4 million, said spokeswoman Julianne Hastings.
   The fall preview issue offers one-page glances at the networks'
new programs, with photographs of key characters and comments on
the story lines. Delays in getting the photographs and information
for the stories have pushed the publication from Sept. 10 to Oct. 1.
   ``We're going to do the best we can _ we're going up to the last
minute,'' Sendler said. ``We could get caught.''
   Television casts and crews are usually producing new episodes at
this time, making it easy for photographers to get the pictures
they need, Sendler said.
   But with production halted by the strike, magazine staff members
have been forced to find props and set up many of the shots that
would typically be taken in a studio, Sendler said.
   Things also have been difficult for the magazine's senior
editor, Myles Callum, who writes all the show summaries for the
preview section.
   Callum begins writing about new falls shows in the spring after
watching the pilot episodes. For the preview issue, he reviews
scripts made available by the networks, but this year there are no
writers _ and no scripts _ to help him with his writing.
   Viewers are usually bombarded with 20 or more new shows at the
beginning of the season, but Sendler said some of the shows slated
for the preview issue may never make it to television this fall
because of the strike.
   The magazine will be able to make changes in the preview issue
up to its Sept. 7 deadline. After that, the new fall lineup of
shows is set on paper, whether or not the programs ever make it on
the air.
   In the meantime, the magazine's Sept. 3 issue is a ``survivor's
guide'' offering ``the best you can do'' for fresh programming in
September and October, Sendler said.
   Members of the Writers Guild of America have been on strike
since March 7. Issues in the impasse are payments for reruns of
one-hour television shows rebroadcast domestically and all shows
rebroadcast overseas.

<HEAD>FCC Ordered To Reconsider Rules For `Indecent' Broadcasts</HEAD>

   The Federal Communications Commission must
reconsider an order that broadcasters can only air programs with
``indecent'' content from midnight to 6 a.m., a federal appeals
court ruled Friday.
   The ruling said the FCC failed to make a case for those specific
hours, but _ in a victory for the agency _ affirmed its right to
regulate programming to protect children.
   The unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
also upheld the commission's definition of indecent material on
radio and television.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said after the ruling, ``I intend
to respond promptly to the court's question regarding those
specific times by recommending the initiation of a commission
proceeding.''
   The commission's midnight-6 a.m. policy, adopted in 1987, was a
change from a 1978 policy which only allowed programs with indecent
material to be aired on television or radio from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
The FCC made the switch because it believed many children were
still awake between 10 p.m. and midnight.
   Broadcasters, program suppliers and public interest groups
challenged the new time restraint, saying the programs with adult
content could only be aired when most listeners were asleep. They
said this violated the First Amendment by denying adults access to
constitutionally protected material.
   The petitioners also challenged the definition of indecent
programs as too vague.
   The court said that ``in view of the curtailment of broadcaster
freedom and adult listener choice ... the commission failed to
consider fairly and fully what time lines should be drawn.''
   The judges said that in the three radio shows used as test
cases, the commission cited population figures that estimated the
number of teens in the total listening audience.
   There was no indication of the size of the predicted audience
for the specific radio stations in question, the court said.
   ``More troubling, the FCC ventures no explanation why it takes
teens aged 12-17 to be the relevant age group for channeling
purposes,'' the court said.
   The judges noted that in 1976, the FCC was mainly interested in
preventing children under 12 from seeing or hearing the indecent
material.
   ``We agree the FCC's midnight advice, indeed its entire position
on'' the time restriction ``was not adequately thought through,''
the judges said.''
   ``Thus, the FCC must endeavor to determine what ... rule will
most effectively promote parental _ as distinguished from
government _ control.''
   Patrick said he was ``delighted that the court ... has
unquestionably affirmed the commission's authority to regulate the
broadcast of indecent material, permitting parents to control their
children's access to sexually explicit programs.''
   The indecency definition that was upheld was adopted by the FCC
from a Supreme Court ruling. It defines indecent programming as:
   ``Exposure of children to language ... that depicts or
describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.''
   Peggy Charren, president of Action For Children's Television in
Cambridge, Mass., praised the ruling.
   She commented, ``The case says it wasn't a good idea to close
down the window on indecency from 10 o clock to midnight. We think
that limits speech important to the public.''
   The ruling was written by U.S. Circuit Judge Ruth B. Ginsburg.
Concurring were Circuit Judges Spottswood W. Robinson III and David
Sentelle.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Mandelas Not Target in Arson Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned
leader of the African National Congress, and his family were not
the targets of an arson attack that destroyed their home, Mandela's
attorney asserted Friday.
   Attorney Ismail Ayob said he had ``an idea'' of what prompted
the attack but that he had to honor Mandela's request that no
statement be made.
   ``Mr. Mandela was not the target, the family was not the
target,'' Ayob told a news conference after spending the night
talking to youths in Soweto, a black township oustide Johannesburg.
   He said Mandela had sent a message from Pollsmoor Prison saying
there should be ``no prosecutions, no witchhunts'' for Thursday's
attack on the Mandela home. Mandela, 70, is serving a life sentence
after being convicted in 1964 of sabotage and plotting to overthrow
the government.
   Ayob also disputed a claim by Robert J. Brown, a businessman
from High Point, N.C., who said he had been given power of attorney
by the Mandelas to protect their interests.
   The attorney said the Mandela family would not file a complaint
with police about the arson attack and would work with community
leaders to try to bring peace and avoid reprisals.
   He called ``laughable'' a report that police were investigating
the possibility that the African National Congress' rival guerrilla
group, the Pan Africanist Congress, may have been involved in the
arson.
   Ayob would not respond to questions about reports by black
journalists that teen-agers who guard the Mandela house had been
involved in a dispute with students at a nearby high school over a
girl. The reports said about 40 youths, including some wearing
jackets from the high school, attacked the house after one or more
students were beaten by members of the group guarding the home.
   Ayob said the modest four-room bungalow, in which the Mandela
family has lived since the 1940s, would be rebuilt and the work was
expected to take a few weeks.
   Mrs. Mandela, her youngest daughter Zindzi, and two
grandchildren who lived in the house were away at the time of the
attack.
   Ayob challenged statements by Brown who, after visiting Mandela
in prison, announced that he had been given the power of attorney
to represent the family's interests worldwide and to prevent
concerts and other events from being staged in the Mandela name by
people with no connection to the family.
   Brown made the announcement last week outside the prison with
Mrs. Mandela standing beside him.
   Ayob read to the news conference a statement he said had been
dictated by Mandela.
   It said in part: ``Mr. Robert Brown does not represent the
Mandela family's interests in any way.'' It said that at the July
23 meeting with Brown, Mandela had ``firmly rejected'' the
suggestion that Brown be given power of attorney, and said ``any
matter related to the family would only be dealt with by the
African National Congress.''
   The ANC is the main guerrilla organization fighting South
Africa's white-controlled government.
   Ayob said he discussed the issue with Mrs. Mandela Thursday
night, after her house burned down, and she agreed to the contents
of the statement he released.
   However, American publicist Armstrong Williams, a colleague of
Brown, said Mrs. Mandela had called him in North Carolina and asked
him to announce on her behalf, ``It's nonsense what Ayob said.
Everything he said was exaggerated.''
   The ANC issued a statement from its headquarters in Lusaka,
Zambia, supporting Ayob and saying Brown's ``claims are proved as
false.''
   Brown has known the Mandelas for more than two years. He has
paid for their eldest daughter, Zenani, and her husband to attend
Boston University.
   He said from his Johannesburg hotel room that Mrs. Mandela and
Zindzi were with him during the discussion with Mandela in the
prison cell and Ayob has no one to corroborate his statement
purportedly from Mandela.
   Brown said, ``The family asked me to do something. Mrs. Mandela
has asked me to stop the ripoff of the Mandela family name. ... As
long as the family wants me to do something about that I will do
that with vigor.''

<TEXT>
   A sailor who said he dropped out of the
Navy Rescue Swimmer School because he feared for his life will
retake the course that was revamped after the death of a recruit.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Phil Nazzaro, 27, an electronics
technician at Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, said Friday
that Navy officials made their offer last month, shortly after he
talked to the news media about the school.
   Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died March 2
during a training exercise at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   The Navy barred instructors from touching students after an
instructor was accused of holding Mirecki's head under water,
causing him to panic and literally die of fright, according to
testimony in an investigative hearing.
   ``My command wasn't aware of what I went through,'' Nazzaro told
the Pensacola News Journal. ``They were real sympathetic and
helpful.''
   Nazzaro said he dropped out of the school last summer, three
days before graduation, after he nearly drowned during a training
exercise called ``sharks and daisies.'' He said he decided to speak
out about the experience after Mirecki's death.
   The day of his death, Mirecki panicked, climbed out of the
training pool and shouted that he was quitting, but instructors
pushed him back in the water where he collapsed and died. A
pathologist said Mirecki had a phobia of being dragged under water,
which triggered heart failure followed by drowning.
   The Navy shut down the school a few weeks after the recruit
died. A curriculum review resulted in the ban against instructors
touching students and abolished the ``sharks-and-daisies'' drill,
during which instructors played the roles of panicked air-crash
survivors and would randomly put head-holds on students who were
trying to rescue them. The student was to pull the instructor under
water to break the hold, then place him in a rescue carry.
   The changes also require students to immediately be removed from
a drill if they ask to quit. In the past, instructors would force
trainees to complete an exercise before allowing them to withdraw.
   Nazzaro said he didn't expect the Navy to go as far as it did in
its curriculum changes.
   ``I think they're long overdue and they sound great to me,'' he
said.
   Nazzaro said if he passes the course he can reclaim the
helicopter anti-submarine warfare rating he lost when he dropped
out of rescue swimmer training.

<HEAD>Boeing Running Behind on Delivery of New Presidential Jet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department has been notified that
the Boeing Co. is running behind schedule for delivery of the new
Air Force One, the jet that carries the president.
   Air Force Capt. Michael Laughlin said Friday that the
manufacturer ``had set a goal a long time ago of trying to get
delivery'' by Nov. 30.
   ``But it's a one-of-a-kind'' sort of plane, the spokesman said
in a telephone interview.
   He said Boeing told Pentagon officials it was having ``technical
difficulties with the installation of wiring bundles and the
availability of parts associated with'' the interior wiring.
   Loughlin said that Boeing is going to announce soon ``a new
delivery date,'' and administration officials hope the wide-bodied
Boeing 747 jet will be ready in time for some use by President
Reagan.
   At the White House, James C. McKinney, director of the military
office, said presidential aides hope Boeing can have the plane
ready at least by Jan. 20, 1989, inauguration day.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, would then get to use the new
aircraft to fly to their home in California.
   Asked if it appeared the aircraft would not be ready by
mid-January, McKinney said, ``Not so far, but everybody's got their
fingers crossed.''
   Meanwhile, the Air Force is building a new hangar kitchen to
replace the one at Andrews Air Force base in suburban Maryland that
has been used so far to prepare in-flight meals for passengers of
the presidential jet.
   Because the larger Boeing 747 will allow the seating of 93
people on the custom-made jet, compared to 69 seats on the existing
Boeing 707, the Air Force must have a hangar kitchen capable of
turning out as many as 4,000 meals at a time for Air Force One and
another Boeing 747 that flies as its backup.
   The custom-made presidential jet has a private compartment for
the chief executive as well as a flying office and separate
compartments for aides, guests, Secret Service agents and traveling
reporters.
   Laughlin acknowledged that it would be unlikely that Air Force
One and its traveling companion, the backup Boeing 747, would ever
need as many as 4,000 meals.
   But he said that capability is based on a ``worst-case
requirement,'' and that it represents the amount of food-serving
capacity that would be necessary if 93 passengers aboard each
aircraft made a seven-day trip and had three meals per day.
   Laughlin said the construction of an enlarged kitchen at the
Andrews Air Force Base hangar was necessitated by the need to keep
a larger volume of meals ready for loading onto the planes.
   ``You can make the pre-packaged meals in about the same space,
but it's storing them that's the problem,'' he said.

Adair put out the last blaze Friday at the Piper Alpha petroleum
platform, which was demolished three weeks ago by an explosion and
fire that killed 167 men.
   A spokeswoman for Occidental Petroleum, the operator and main
owner of the platform, said Adair's crew poured concrete down the
last of the oil wells at the site, 120 miles east of Scotland in
the North Atlantic.
   She added that ``there is much work to be done yet'' on the
burned-out platform, which exploded in a fireball the night of July
6. It was the world's worst oil rig disaster, and Occidental said
it suspected a gas leak was responsible.
   Adair, 73, was called in to extinguish fires that continued
burning at many of the platform's 36 wellheads. He and his crew
pumped sea water into the wells and sealed them with concrete plugs.
   The Occidental spokesman said Adair will return to Aberdeen this
weekend if his men make enough progress with their remaining tasks.
   Lloyd's insurance exchange has said the accident is expected to
cost insurers a record of more than $1 billion.
   Work continued on stabilizing the platform. One of the legs has
been partly filled with cement and a steel cross-frame is to be
built.

<HEAD>West Germany reduces number of low-level military flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry said Friday it is
reducing the low-altitude military training flights over West
Germany by 2,000 hours a year.
   Public protests about low-altitude flights have increased
because of several accidents involving NATO jets on training
missions.
   Rupert Scholz, the defense ministser, told reporters he had
rescinded an order for the training of jet fighter pilots as bomber
pilots, ``eliminating without replacement 1,000 hours of low-level
flights.''
   Another 1,000 hours of low-altitude training flights are to be
moved to a training area at Decimomannu on the Mediterranean island
of Sardinia, Scholz said.
   Since March 31, five U.S. Air Force F-16 jet fighters have
crashed on training flights over West German territory, including
three June 29.
   Fighter jets of the British, French and West German air forces
also have crashed in the past four months.
   Scholz announced July 5, after a West German F-4 Phantom
crashed, that he was making reduction of low-level training flights
a priority.
   According to the Defense Ministry, about 45,000 hours of flight
training are carried out by NATO military units annually over West
Germany.
   Military officials have said the flights are necessary to keep
pilots at top readiness.
   Scholz said he hopes to achieve further reductions in domestic
flights by West German air force fighters.
   Training of West German pilots at Goose Bay, Labrador, will be
increased by about 1,000 hours to 5,000 hours a year in 1990 or
1991, Scholz said. He also said he has been in contact with other
NATO officials to urge them to take all possible measures to reduce
the number of low-altitude flights.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Friday that Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis ``is
for a weaker defense.''
   Fitzwater made the comment after a visiting West German
conservative leader, Franz Joseph Strauss, said at the White House,
``Every American president will provide the same policy regardless
of who wins'' the presidential election.
   Strauss, speaking with reporters after a meeting with President
Reagan, said, ``The guidelines of American policy will remain
unchanged.''
   However, presidential spokesman Fitzwater said, ``We have great
differences with the Democratic nominee in terms of defense posture.
   ``He basically is for a weaker defense and cutting defense, and
we are for a strong defense. He is for reducing commitments all
around the world, it would seem. So I would simply ask that anyone
take a pretty close look at Mr. Dukakis' foreign policy and defense
policies and they can judge for themselves.''
   The Dukakis campaign was quick to respond. ``Marlin Fitzwater
must be consulting the White House astrologer on Dukakis' position
on defense,'' said senior campaign adviser Kirk O'Donnell.
   ``Dukakis is for a strong defense and a strong America and he is
for strengthening alliances like NATO,'' O'Donnell said.
   Strauss, the minister-president (governor) of Bavaria and head
of the Bavarian branch of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing party,
talked to reporters in English.
   Vice President George Bush, the expected Republican presidential
nominee, walked up to reporters questioning Strauss and posed for
pictures with the visiting leader.
   Asked what difference it would make to West Germany whether he
or Dukakis became the next president, he stressed his familiarity
with the North Atlantic Alliance, saying, ``I understand the
alliance, I have been part of strengthening the alliance, I have
been working for the alliance.''
   Asked specifically to comment on Strauss' view that the election
would mean little difference to U.S. policy, Bush said Strauss ``is
a good man and he's my friend. He can say anything he wants here. I
don't want to put him in a difficult position.''

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frankfurt airport has become the
hub for arms shipments to the Persian Gulf region, according to a
book that goes on sale Monday.
   Juergen Roth, a West German journalist and television writer,
says in ``The Illegal German Weapons Business and Its International
Entanglement'' that the national airline Lufthansa carried military
supplies to Iran as late as June.
   Arms and ammunition are brought to Frankfurt by foreign
transport planes every two months, transferred to Iran Air and Iraq
Air cargo jets and flown to the gulf, he said. Iran and Iraq have
been at war since September 1980.
   Georg Schreiber, spokesman for the Frankfurt airport customs
office, said Friday no illegal arms were passing through the
airport.
   ``We control strategic goods coming in and passing through.
There has never been a case of such illegal wares being
transferred,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Roth accused West German security officials of ``silently
tolerating'' illegal arms transfers.
   He said an Israeli cargo jet landed at the airport last Dec. 29
and customs police provided security while it was unloaded. The
cargo included ``electronic spare parts and air-to-air rockets for
U.S.-built Iranian air force F-14 and F-15 jet fighters,'' Roth
said.
   According to the author, the plane also carried supplies for
Iranian Hawk air defense artillery batteries and about 80 TOW
rockets, and the cargo was transferred to an Iran Air jet.
   Citing investigations by Swedish customs officials, and
statements from a West German weapons dealer identified as Paul
Beermann, the writer said the weapons were being shipped by a
syndicate of several European companies.
   He said many of the arms moved under false manifests, sometimes
as industrial chemicals and hardware.
   Companies involved are located in West Germany, Britain,
Switzerland, France, The Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Belgium and
Sweden, Roth said.

   A minister who was abducted by two state
prison escapees and forced to drive them away in a church van was
released unharmed Friday and one of the convicts was captured,
police said.
   Michael Truitt, youth and education minister at Cresthill
Baptist Church, was released when the inmates abandoned the van
about 100 miles away, said Chatham County Police Chief Al St.
Lawrence.
   The two inmates who abducted the minister escaped with a third
man Thursday from a work detail at the prison near the Savannah
International Airport.
   Captured Friday was Steve McDuffy, 31, of Baldwin, who was
serving a 20-year sentence for burglary. McDuffy was arrested
without incident shortly before 4 p.m. while trying to make a
telephone call a couple of miles from where the van had been
abandoned, police said.
   Dennis L. Williams, who was serving two life sentences for
killing his two infant sons, was found hiding in a boathouse on
Thursday. He told police he was left behind by the other two
convicts when they waded into the marsh because he could not swim,
detectives said.
   Officers identified the man still at large as Kendal Eugene
Yawn, 25, of Alamo, who also is serving a 20-year sentence for
burglary.
   Truitt, 29, drove the van to the church Friday morning to meet
children who were to attend a day camp, St. Lawrence said. The
escapees had broken into a restroom at the church sometime during
the night, he said.
   None of the children had arrived when the abduction occurred and
the trip was canceled.

   The United States will keep providing aid to
Palestinian Arabs through private relief groups while it seeks an
explanation from Jordan for abandoning a special development
program on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   ``These projects enhance the well-being and economic development
of the Palestinian people,'' State Department spokesman Charles E.
Redman said Friday.
   U.S. contributions this year are expected to total $7 million.
   Jordan announced on Thursday it was canceling the development
program in a move to give more responsibility over the 1.5 million
Palestinians in the Israeli-held territories to the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   A Jordanian statement in Amman said the kingdom was taking the
step in ``response to PLO demands.''
   The program, which exists largely on paper, is a $1.3 billion
plan for which the United States contributed $5.5 million in 1986,
$14 million in 1987 and $5.7 million this year.
   Italy has contributed about $20 million and Britain a lesser
amount.
   The plan had the enthusiastic support of Secretary of State
George P. Shultz as a means of improving the ``quality of life'' on
the West Bank and in Gaza, and also had the endorsement of Israel.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it
was not clear whether the fund would be canceled, turned over to
the PLO or operated in some other way.
   The State Department avoided any criticism of Jordan's decision.
   ``I don't have any reaction other than to say that we're
consulting with the government of Jordan regarding the announcement
and how it intends to implement the decision,'' Redman said.
   He said Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy would
take up the issue with Jordanian leaders when he is in Amman next
month. Murphy also will visit Egypt, Israel and Syria and has urged
Palestinians to meet with him.
   While King Hussein's decision was widely interpreted as at least
a partial withdrawal from the West Bank, the State Department said
it was too early to make any analysis.
   ``I just don't have any way to further evaluate the impact of
the Jordanian decision, and that's why we're going to talk to them
about how this decision is going to be implemented,'' Redman said.
   Asked if the United States would keep making contributions if
the fund were run by the PLO, the U.S. official said: ``Obviously
not.''
   Shultz is counting on Hussein to support a U.S. plan for peace
talks with Israel that would exclude the PLO but include
Palestinians in a Jordanian delegation.
   Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir have not
endorsed the plan, but Shultz is expected to make a fifth
peace-seeking trip to the region in the fall to solicit their
support.
   ``We don't interpret this announcement that we're talking about
as any lessening of Jordan's intention to remain actively involved
in the peace process,'' Redman said.

   A ransom note left by the kidnapper of an
ailing woman indicates the abduction may have been an act of
revenge against her wealthy husband, a psychiatrist said.
   Annie L. Hearin, 72, was reported missing by her husband, Robert
Hearin, Tuesday night shortly before he found the note, which
demanded an unspecified amount in ransom and instructed him not to
notify police, authorities said.
   Police spokesman Sgt. Chip Pippen said Friday that police would
not be making any statements about the case until there is a major
development.
   Mrs. Hearin was last seen Tuesday afternoon when she held a
bridge party at her Jackson home. Her husband found the typewritten
note inside the front door.
   Hearin, 70, is president and chief executive officer of
Mississippi Valley Gas Co., one of Mississippi's biggest utilities,
and is a major stockholder in Lamar Life Insurance Co. and
Trustmark National Bank, the state's second-largest financial
institution.
   He also has oil and gas and other interests and once owned a
stake in football's New York Jets. His wealth has been estimated at
more than $100 million.
   Rodrigo Galvez, a psychiatrist called in to analyze the letter
and profile the kidnapper, said the note listed several groups as
``being wronged.'' The psychiatrist refused to identify the groups
or give further details.
   The kidnapper ``will tell later how much the family must pay,''
Galvez said. He said the letter promised Mrs. Hearin will be
returned to her family if the note is followed.
   Mrs. Hearin suffers from a chronic inflammation of the small
intestine that requires daily medication, without which she could
die, officials said.
   Mayor Dale Danks said the note was ``very vague and difficult to
comply with'' because it made no specific demands of where to send
ransom money or how much to send. He said the kidnapper had made no
further contact with the family.

   A police communique released Friday
reported the killings of six peasants, a mayor, two union officials
and a policeman but did not say who might be responsible for the
deaths.
   It said all 10 victims were slain Thursday.
   The peasants were killed at a ranch near the town of Puerto
Libertador, 230 miles north of Bogota, according to the report.
   Right-wing death squads have been accused of killing dozens of
peasants in northern Colombia in the last six months. Some
officials have blamed leftist guerrillas.
   The communique also said gunmen fatally shot Ramiro Garcia,
mayor of the town of Convencion, 250 miles northeast of Bogota. It
did not give details. Garcia, of the Conservative party, was
elected mayor March 13.
   The report said two officials of the petroleum workers union
were killed in the oil refinery town of Barrancabermeja, 160 miles
north of Bogota, by a gunman on a motorcycle.
   A policeman in the southeastern town of Aguas Claras also was
fatally shot by a man on a bicycle, the communique said without
elaborating.

   Leftist guerrillas sent a message to a
sparsely attended peace conference Friday saying drug traffickers
should included in the talks because they cause so many problems in
Colombia.
   Neither the government nor any of Colombia's six guerrilla
groups was represented at the conference, which the Roman Catholic
Church sponsored. The government had threatened the rebels with
arrest if appeared.
   Rebels demanded the peace conference in exchange for releasing a
former presidential candidate, Alvaro Gomez Hurtado. He was
abducted May 29 by the April 19 Movement, known as M-19, and held
for 53 days.
   Guerrillas and a representative of President Virgilio Barco sent
messages to the conference. About 60 people attended, including
church officials, 20 congressmen and business leaders.
   The nation's smallest guerrilla group, the Workers'
Revolutionary Party, said in a message that drug traffickers should
attend ``because they are the main factors of destabilization'' of
Colombia.
   Other guerrilla groups said they would not surrender their
weapons as long as the army wages what the insurgents call a dirty
war.
   Hundreds of people have disappeared and death squads have killed
more than 800 leftists in three years.
   Guerrillas also demand that Gen. Rafael Samudio be fired as
defense minister and replaced by a civilian.
   Cardenal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo said in a speech the rebels must
show sincerity in any negotiations arising from the peace
conference and ``make some concrete gestures that demonstrate
willingness to end bloodshed.''
   A cease-fire negotiated with some guerrilla groups in 1982
collapsed over the next two years, with rebels and army blaming
each other for truce violations. The army said the guerrillas
tricked the government into peace negotiations to give themselves
time to recuperate from military setbacks.
   Barco spokesman Rafael Pardo said in a message to Friday's
conference the boycott does not mean the government refuses to talk
with the guerrillas.
   He said talks should lead not to just ``living together with the
guerrillas,'' but should have a goal of bringing the rebels ``into
the legal political process.''
   Pardo is Barco's adviser on talks dealings with guerrillas and
has met several times with leaders of the Colombian Revolutionary
Armed Forces, the country's largest guerrilla group with an
estimated 5,000-10,000 combatants.
   In his message, Pardo asked the guerrillas to say what the
government would have to do to get them to end 30 years of
insurrection.
   Gomez was released despite the government's refusal to agree to
be host for the conference. The Catholic church, which helped
negotiate Gomez's freedom, organized the conference and Gomez
attended it.
   All of Colombia's six living former presidents were invited but
none attended.

   Here are some comments Friday from the

   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, saying he won't tolerate another Pentagon

going to use our defense dollars to line the pockets of Washington
consultants.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, giving Bush credit for unveiling a $2.2 billion
day care proposal earlier this week: ``I think the Bush proposal is
a step in the right direction and I'm delighted to see them get
aboard on this issue.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, saying he won't divulge his choice of a running
mate until the Republicans convene in New Orleans: ``I will keep my
own counsel.''
   
   MARLIN FITZWATER, presidential spokesman, correcting a statement
by visiting West German leader Franz Joseph Strauss that American
policy will stay the same regardless of who wins the presidential
election: ``He (Dukakis) is basically for a weaker defense and
cutting defense, and we are for a strong defense. He is for
reducing commitments all around the world, it would seem.''

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition alliance said Friday it has
asked the military to stop officers from campaigning because it
compromises the forthcoming presidential referendum.
   Patricio Aylwin told a news conference the coalition delivered a
letter to the military junta Tuesday protesting such activity.
   Aylwin is president of the centrist Christian Democratic Party,
one of 16 political groups that formed the alliance to promote a
``no'' vote in the referendum.
   The government plans a yes-or-no ballot in October on a single
candidate, who will be nominated at a meeting Aug. 30 of the army,
navy, air force and national police commanders. President Augusto
Pinochet, 72-year-old army commander who seized power in 1973 coup,
is expected to be chosen.
   Several high-ranking officers who favor Pinochet's nomination
have been campaigning at public rallies and in military gatherings.
Aylwin said that ``compromises the legitimacy of the (electoral)
process.''
   Chile's Constitution charges the armed forces with ensuring the
impartiality of elections.
   The coalition's letter, copies of which were given to reporters
Friday, said ``a significant number of officers, almost all of them
from the army, have begun to openly carry out an ostensible
political-electoral activity in favor of a `yes' vote.''
   It said the officers also were calling on troops in barracks
speeches to support the candidacy of Pinochet, ``whom they descibe
as the `supreme leader' or the `chieftan of the armed forces, with
a rhetoric similar to ... that of fascist and other dictatorial
regimes.''
   The referendum will be the first presidential ballot since a
Marxist, Salvador Allende, won the 1970 electoin. Gen. Pinochet
overthrew him in September 1973 and Allende died in the coup.
   If a majority votes for the candidate, he will begin an
eight-year term in March 1989. If he is rejected, a Pinochet is to
remain in power until a free election in 1990.

   A federal appellate court panel ruled 2-1
Friday that the nation's space agency must release the audio tapes
of the ill-fated Challenger shuttle flight.
   The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals here affirmed a lower
court decision that the tapes should be made public under the
Freedom of Information Act.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had refused to
give up the tapes, saying release would invade the privacy of
families of the seven astronauts who died in the Jan. 28, 1986
disaster.
   The judges said the tapes cannot be held back under a FOIA
exemption that permits withholding of ``personnel and medical files
and similar files'' that constitute ``a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy.''
   NASA cited that exemption in refusing to release the taes, even
though it made public written transcripts of the astronauts'
conversations. NASA said the tapes contain no new information on
the flight.
   U.S. Circuit Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III said in the
majority opinion that the court had to decide whether the sound of
the human voice, communicating non-personal information, should be
considered a ``similar file'' that could be withheld.
   The court concluded, ``a file is not to be considered `similar'
unless at a minimum it contains personal information _ information
somehow related to an individual's life.
   ``To call the sound of a human voice `personal information'
distorts the plain meaning and common understanding of the phrase
... As such, the tape recording of the voices of the astronauts ...
without more, does not constitute a `similar file''' that could be
withheld.
   Robinson said that Congress intended that the exemption be
designed to protect individuals from injury and embarrassment
resulting from unnecessary disclosure of personal information.
   ``To accept NASA's ... argument would be to hold that every tape
recording of audible human utterances, regardless of its content,
is invariably a similar file because every person's voice is
essentially unique,'' the ruling said.
   U.S. Circuit Judge Harry Edwards concurred in the opinion.
   In a dissent, U.S. Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg argued NASA
should have a chance to show that the tapes would invade the
privacy of the astronauts' families. He said the court could not
make such a determination based on the record as it now exists.
   ``I find it inconceivable that the sound and inflection of a
person's voice during the last seconds of his or her life is not
information that somehow relates to an individual's life,''
Ginsburg said.
   ``Whatever insights can be gleaned from their voices, whatever
inferences can be drawn about their thoughts and feelings at the
very moment of their deaths, they are not to be found in that
transcript; if they are anywhere, they are in the tape.''

   The Radio Sandino news show ``En Directo'' was suspended for 48
hours for violating communications law, according to an Interior
Ministry communique published Friday in the government newspaper El
Nuevo Diario.
   The private news show ``Fabuloso Siete'' said the suspension was
ordered because of ``strong criticism'' by the government program
of one of the deputy directors of the opposition newspaper La
Prensa.
   A Radio Sandino newswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the suspension stemmed from a commentary made Thursday by one
of the broadcasters of ``En Directo.''
   The suspension of a state-run program may represent an effort to
project an image of fairness in the government's series of
broadcast and newspaper closures. It was the first action against a
state-run news organization.
   The crackdown began after government opponents held a big
demonstration July 10 outside Managua. Police battled protesters
and arrested about 40 people.
   The next day, the government complained of media coverage and
ordered La Prensa, Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper, and the
Roman Catholic station Radio Catolica closed. La Prensa reopened
Wednesday after its 15-day suspension, but the Catholic station was
closed indefinitely.
   A private news show, ``El Despertar,'' was also shut down
indefinitely. Another private show, ``El Noticiero,'' broadcast on
Radio Mundial, returned to the air this week after a 48-hour
suspension.
   Also Friday, El Nuevo Diario reported that a group of family
members blocked a road Thursday leading to Masachapa, about 30
miles southwest of Managua, to protest recruitment of youths into
military service.
   The newspaper said the demonstration ``was manipulated by
certain individuals.''
   La Prensa showed a photograph in its Thursday night edition of
special police forces shoving women.
   The two-year mandatory military service has been bitterly
opposed by many Nicaraguans.

<HEAD>Ben Ali Opens First Party Congress Since Bourguiba Ousted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali opened a
congress of the governing party Friday, the first since
President-for-Life Habib Bourguiba was ousted nine months ago.
   Ben Ali told 2,000 delegates representing the 1.5 million
members of the Constitutional Democratic Rally they must adapt to a
new democratic spirit.
   ``Only democracy can restore to the citizen his dignity, to the
people their sovereignty and to the country its rightful place in
the world,'' he said.
   Changes undertaken since the bloodless Nov. 7 coup are
irreversible and will lead to a society of ``rights, liberties and
pluralism,'' the president said.
   Ben Ali, 52, said at the time of the coup that Bourguiba was
senile.
   Bourguiba will be 85 next month and remains under house arrest
in a villa at Mornag outside Tunis. He had ruled ruled this North
African nation since its independence from France 31 years ago.
   Ben Ali, a former interior minister, has promised to open the
political system, which was monopolized by Bourguiba's Destourian
Socialist Party. The party's name was changed earlier this year to
the Constitutional Democratic Rally.
   He told the congress: ``The life of the party, its rules and its
programs have repercussions on all public affairs and all aspects
of life in our country.''
   Representatives of the three legal opposition parties were
invited to the opening session of the congress, which ends Sunday.
   Opposition leaders have said they will be watching to see if
steps are taken to separate the power of the party from that of the
state.
   As in the past, the chief of state also is the president of the
governing party and the prime minister is the secretary-general.
   Opposition leaders noted that Ben Ali appointed 125 of the 200
members of the party Central Committee, with the others elected by
party members.
   Officials of Ben Ali's party said up to 80 percent of the
delegates are new and this is the first congress they have attended.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge issued a permanent injunction
Friday against the Justice Department's drug-testing program, under
which the agency would test 1,800 employees who are in sensitive
law enforcement posts.
   U.S. District Judge George Revercomb initially issued a
preliminary injunction, saying mandatory random drug testing cannot
be justified because the department does not consider drug use to
be widespread at the agency.
   ``It is impossible to argue that mandatory random urinalysis
drug testing serves the purpose of deterring illegal drug use by
trusted and apparently law-abiding employees,'' Revercomb said in a
14-page opinion granting the preliminary injunction.
   The judge said the 42 Justice Department employees who sued in
an attempt to block the program show ``a strong likelihood of
success'' on their claim that compulsory random urinalysis drug
testing is an unreasonable search and seizure that violates the
Fourth Amendment
   The government had asserted a critical interest in the security
of sensitive and classified law enforcement information and in the
integrity and public image of the department.
   Yet ``given the absence of a drug problem at the Department, it
is difficult to see how security of sensitive information, or the
integrity and public image of the Department would be much served''
by drug testing, said the judge.
   Revercomb noted that employees also might embezzle, obstruct
justice or accept bribes, but that ``no one could seriously argue
that, absent any grounds to suspect misconduct,'' the Justice
Department would be justified in tapping the employee's telephone,
censoring his mail or searching his house.
   ``Something more than unfounded fears must justify an intrusive
search,'' Revercomb said. ``Even though a relaxed `reasonableness'
standard applies to a search by the government as an employer, such
a search must be for a non-investigatory and work-related purpose.
... Referring to previous cases, Revercomb noted that
individualized suspicion is ``usually a prerequisite to a
constitutional search or seizure.''
   Under the Justice Department plan announced late last month, the
agency would have started testing in as soon as 60 days. Seven
percent of a group of 1,800 employees in positions deemed sensitive
would be tested annually.
   After issuing the preliminary injunction, the Justice Department
sought, and was granted, a permanent injunction. The government
will ask the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals next week for a stay of
the permanent injunction so that the department can proceed with
the program, said Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown.
   It can be more difficult to obtain a stay of a preliminary
injunction because the legal question presented in that instance is
whether a district judge abused his discretion, which is quite
broad. The review of a permanent injunction would examine the
merits of the constitutional arguments in the case, a prospect
favored by the Justice Department.
   Assistant Attorney General John Bolton had argued Thursday to
Revercomb that ``the whole world is watching,'' including leaders
of the Medellin cocaine cartel and Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Stephen Sachs, the former Maryland attorney general, who is
representing 42 Justice Department employees who filed sued to stop
the program, said the agency ``clearly does not understand the
difference between ends and means.''

   At least nine people died of cholera or
gastroenteritis in New Delhi on Friday, raising July's death toll
from the two diseases to 191, a city health official said.
   The United News of India reported that Lt. Gov. Harkishan Lal
Kapur, the top administrator of New Delhi, submitted his
resignation after a meeting Friday with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
on the water-borne diseases.
   No reason was given for Kapur's resignation and there was no
word whether it was accepted.
   The city health official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said 1,027 new cases of the diseases were reported Friday in the
city.
   Meanwhile, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, 157
people have died in the gastroenteritis and cholera epidemic that
has broken out in at least 30 of the state's 57 districts,
newspapers said Friday.
   The deaths raised the number of victims nationwide to 618 since
monsoon rains started in late June. Officials blame the epidemic on
the contamination of the water supply by rainfall flowing through
sewage and uncollected garbage.

<HEAD>New Program To Help Children With Serious Disabilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush's office announced
Friday a new federal program aimed at helping children with serious
disabilities to receive additional benefits for care in the home.
   The idea behind the program to be administered by the Department
of Health and Human Services is to allow such children to be with
their parents in instances where the family income is too high to
qualify these adults for home care expenses under the Supplemental
Security Income program.
   Such care previously has been available to these children only
in hospitals, and Bush's press office said this had the effect of
discouraging parents from ``keeping their families at home.''
   The program was developed by the Health Care Financing
Administration, a part of HHS, in response to a request that Bush
made last March to a meeting of the Presidential Task Force on
Regulatory Relief, which he heads.
   The problem was brought to the vice president's attention by the
family of Kaileigh Mulligan, a 2-year-old Methuen, Mass., girl born
with Downs Syndrome compounded by heart and respiratory problems.
   Kaileigh, who was hospitalized for most of her first year of
life, was able to return home under a Medicaid program for
children, which pays for home care when that care costs no more
than institutional care.
   ``However, when Kaileigh left the hospital, she was notable to
retain the Supplemental Security Income payment she had been using
for personal needs such as diapers, aspirin and other
non-prescription drugs,'' the press office said in a statement.
   The new program involves states to seek waivers for normal home
and community-based care. This would permit, in Kaileigh's case,
the Massachusetts Medicaid program with matching federal funds to
reimburse families for extra non-prescription drugs and medical
supplies that children could receive free at the hospital.
   ``Not only will this plan help keep families together by
facilitating home care of disabled children and eliminating an
incentive to keep them in hospitals, but it is anticipated that
states will be able to reduce the total cost of such care by
reducing the need for institutionalization,'' Bush said in a
statement.

   A professor convicted of killing and
dismembering a teen-age prostitute with a chain saw was sentenced
Friday to 25 years to life in prison by a judge who said the
educator was ``a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.''
   Max Bernard Franc, 58, whose secret life as a homosexual voyeur
was disclosed during his trial, coughed slightly but remained
impassive as Superior Court Judge John Reid imposed the maximum
sentence.
   Reid described the murder of Tracy Leroy Nute, 18, and the
dismemberment of his body with a chain saw as ``hideous, cruel and
callous.''
   Franc was accused of shooting Nute, a runaway from Kansas City,
Mo., chopping up the body and distributing it across 200 miles of
California. Franc said a transient named Terry Adams committed the
crime. But Adams was never found.
   ``Dr. Franc, the one thing that becomes very clear to me is you
are two different people,'' said the judge. ``You're the scholar to
your colleagues. Your students talk about you as if you were the
second coming as a teacher. But none of them talk about what was
going on in the Hollywood area of your life.''
   Franc, who taught at Fresno State University until his arrest
last August, had maintained an apartment in West Hollywood, some
200 miles away, where he paid young men to pose for nude
photographs, his attorney has said.
   ``An analogy has to be drawn to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' said
the judge.
   He imposed the sentence after Franc's sister, Carol Waiters, a
social worker from Philadelphia, made an impassioned plea for her
brother, describing him as a brilliant, bilingual teacher who
inspired his students.
   ``I ask, I beg of you, Judge Reid, do not let this mind go to
waste in prison,'' Mrs. Waiters said in a trembling voice.
   ``He has so much to offer,'' she said. ``To shut him away and
snuff out his creativity and productivity would be a terrible waste
to society.''
   Reid said he hoped Franc would use the time in prison to help
uneducated inmates improve themselves.
   ``I hope you do something beneficial with the rest of your
life,'' he said. ``I think it's a shame it had to come to this. But
these are your acts, no one else's acts.''
   Franc, a native of DePere, Wis., was arrested after a chain saw
he had rented was returned with bits of flesh and blood in it.
   ``Even if the only thing you did was watch someone else kill
Terry Nute, what type of person could go and rent a chain saw
knowing it would be used to cut up a body?'' the judge asked Franc.
``There's no question that's exactly what you did.''
   Deputy Public Defender Mark Kaiserman lost a bid for a new trial
and reduction of the first-degree murder conviction. The judge said
he felt the jury's verdict was proper even if Franc had only aided
and abetted in the murder. He conceded that what actually happened
was never clear and he could not conclude positively that Franc
pulled the trigger to kill Nute.
   Deputy District Attorney Sterling Norris said Franc ``ought to
feel lucky that he doesn't go to the gas chamber'' because special
circumstances were not involved in the case.
   He said the pleas for leniency based on Franc's status as a
college professor ``smacks to me of class distinction.''
   Kaiserman said Franc will appeal his conviction.

<HEAD>Singapore Proposes Elected President, Keeping Parliamentary System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official government report proposed Friday
that Singapore have an elected president who would act as custodian
and not as chief executive, and that the parliamentary system be
kept intact.
   The first deputy prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, said in
presenting the suggested government reforms to Parliament:
   ``The president will not be an executive president. He will only
have a custodial role in two areas _ safeguarding our financial
reserves and the integrity of our public service.''
   Goh said the president should not have power to initiate
policies or make executive decisions.
   The president currently has no special powers but is ceremonial
head of the state. He must assent to any bill passed by Parliament
before it becomes law.
   The recommendations, drawn up by senior ministers, said the
parliamentary system of government should not be altered. The prime
minister and his Cabinet should govern the nation.
   On critical issues, they would still make the decisions but
would have to seek the president's concurrence. If the president
did not go along, the government could take the issue to the people.
   Parliament now elects the president for a four-year term. Under
the changes, the people would directly elect the president for a
six-year term.
   Sinnathamby Rajaratnam, senior minister in the office of
longtime Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, indicated on July 22 that Lee
could be chosen president.
   ``As far as I know, they (ministers) have decided Goh should
become the next prime minister the moment Prime Minister Lee steps
down,'' Rajaratnam was quoted as telling reporters.
   Lee will be 65 years old in September.

   The remains of an Vietnam War Air
Force man listed as missing in action for 22 years were returned
Friday to his native soil in this Florida Panhandle fishing village.
   A funeral and burial ceremony with full military honors were
held for Herbert Eugene Smith, 30, killed July 29, 1966, when his
plane was shot down during a top secret mission over Laos. He was a
flight engineer.
   His remains and those of five other crew members were among
those of 17 U.S. servicemen returned March 2. Smith was a chief
master sergeant in the Air Force.
   Smith's wife, Barbara, 47, of Satellite Beach, said she believed
he might still be missing until forensic experts in Hawaii and
Colorado confirmed the remains were those of her husband.
   ``I was shocked,'' she said in a telephone interview published
Friday in the Pensacola News Journal. ``It was like ... for 22
years, even though he wasn't alive, he wasn't dead. He was still a
part of me. He was a part of my life. Then I was told it was
definite ... it was no longer a mission in my life to find out what
happened to him.''
   Before leaving Travis Air Force Base, Calif., Smith called his
wife on June 30, 1966, their 10th wedding anniversary. A month
later his plane disappeared.
   The Air Force initially told her the plane disappeared over
Thailand where the aircraft was based and there was hope her
husband survived. She also was told not to discuss the matter
because it might hinder his rescue.
   But years later she learned from the Central Intelligence Agency
that her husband was on a top secret mission over Laos. That news
angered her.
   ``I feel like I was lied to lots of time,'' she said. ``I feel
like they withheld information.''
   Mrs. Smith, who had gone to Laos in search of her husband in
1973, cried throughout the service.
   A seven-member honor guard from Tyndall Air Force Base near
Panama City fired three rifle volleys and two buglers played taps.
The U.S. flag that draped the casket was presented to the widow.
   Smith's children, now ages 23 to 31, were struggling with
burying a man few of them remember, Mrs. Smith said.
   Mrs. Smith, who earned a high school diploma and eventually a
master's degree in social work after her husband disappeared, works
as re-adjustment counselor for the Vietnam Veterans Outreach Center
in Orlando.

<HEAD>Deadline Extended For Completing Deal With Bass Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal thrift institution regulators said
Friday they have extended the deadline for completing a deal with
the Robert M. Bass Group to take over one of the nation's largest
savings and loan associations.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it expected to wrap up
negotiations with the Fort Worth, Texas-based Bass group for
acquisition of American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton,
Calif., by Sept. 1.
   The bank board had announced on April 21 that it had granted
exclusive negotiating rights to Bass until July 5, but later
extended that to Aug. 1.
   According to the agency's statement, ``then as now ... the
extension was granted because of the substantial progress made in
the negotiations to that date.''
   The ailing American Savings, owned by the Irvine, Calif.,-based
Financial Corp. of America, the second largest thrift holding
company in the nation, has been a candidate for a government rescue
for nearly a year.
   When the deal is finally completed, it is likely to set a record
as the largest rescue of a savings institution.
   According to a source familiar with the negotiations, the cost
to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures
deposits in S&Ls up to $100,000, would be roughly $1.3 billion to
$2 billion.
   But, the source said, little or none of the assistance would be
in cash. Most of it would come in the form of promissory notes from
FSLIC or in guarantees against the risk of certain kinds of future
losses.
   One of the factors apparently snagging the deal is the Bass
Group's concern that the FSLIC assistance would be subject to
California's 11 percent corporate income tax.
   The California legislature has scheduled a hearing Aug. 8 on a
bill that would make it clear the tax does not apply.
   ``These have been complex negotiations, and the staff has worked
out most of the economic terms,'' said M. Danny Wall, chairman of
the bank board. ``However, there are other details to work out and
documents to complete, and we as a board need time to carefully
review the final recommendation from our staff.''

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Jill Ireland, who lost her
right breast to cancer four years ago, said Friday the illness has
returned but she will fight it with radiation therapy and willpower.
   Miss Ireland, 52, said she learned this week she has a localized
malignancy in her lymph nodes, but it is not spreading. She will
undergo five weeks of radiation treatment.
   ``I was absolutely terrified again'' and her husband, tough guy
actor Charles Bronson, was ``shocked and fearful'' when told the
diagnosis, she said during a news conference.
   The cancer was discovered when Miss Ireland sought treatment for
what she thought was a strained shoulder. Instead, it turned out to
be swollen lymph glands pressing on nerves above her right collar
bone, she said.
   Miss Ireland said she will also use a technique called
visualization to battle the illness.
   ``I visualize my cancer as fish eggs, and three times a day I
will visualize my piranha fish destroying, literally gnashing their
teeth and destroying my cancer,'' she said. ``That's a very good
technique because it stops you feeling like a victim.''
   Miss Ireland wrote a best-selling book called ``Life Wish''
about her 1984 bout with cancer and announced her new book, ``Life
Lines,'' will appear in March.
   She declined to reveal the contents, calling it ``somewhat
explosive.''
   She also is scheduled to be host of a syndicated television talk
show this winter, she said.

   An Armenian dissident expelled by
the Soviet Union will fly to Rome on Saturday in another step
toward his eventual destination of the United States, a U.S.
diplomat said.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan arrived in this East Africa nation, a Soviet
ally, after he was charged with slander and expelled from the
Soviet Union on July 21.
   The accusations stemmed from his reports to Western journalists
on a campaign by ethnic Armenians for annexation of the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan by the neighboring southern
Soviet republic of Armenia.
   Ayrikyan, 39, has been promised asylum in the United States. He
has said his wife, three children, and several other relatives will
join him there.
   However, he has vowed never to abandon efforts to return to
Armenia.
   The activist served 17 years in Soviet prisons and labor camps
before his release last year.
   The U.S. diplomat, who spoke Friday on condition of anonymity,
did not say when Ayrikyan would arrive in the United States.
   Ayrikyan has said he will reunite with relatives in France
before heading for the United States. He planned to settle in the
Los Angeles area.

   The military deployed thousands
of troops to guard against violence in a march Friday that marked
the 1975 killing by security forces of 14 student demonstrators.
   About 600 students walked peacefully from the University of El
Salvador campus to the downtown site where the 14 were killed on
July 30, 1975.
   The marchers, many of them masked and carrying wooden staves or
iron bars, placed banners and a wreath of evergreen branches and
yellow roses at the site and sang a revolutionary song before
returning to campus.
   Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova, the defense minister, told a news
conference military intelligence had expected about 70 armed
guerrillas among the marchers. He said leftist rebels battling the
U.S.-backed government are infiltrating labor, student and peasant
unions.
   At a separate news conference, a new alliance of peasants,
students and leftist workers called the Bread, Land, Work and
Liberty Movement accused the armed forces of killing one of its
leaders, Rigoberto Orellana.
   The government had called the alliance a guerrilla front.
   Orellana died Thursday after he was hit by a car in downtown San
Salvador. Jorge Villegas, Jaime Estevez and Santiago Flores, also
leaders of the group, said the car had followed him for days and
that he was run over intentionally.
   Armed forces officials were not available for comment on the
allegation.
   After a July 21 rally by students and workers that turned
violent, authorities were apprehensive about Friday's march.
   Police broke up the July 21 march with tear gas and gunfire. At
least nine vehicles were burned in that demonstration.
   Col. Galileo Torres, head of the armed forces press office, said
thousands of troops were mobilized Friday, including all National
Police and Treasury Police units in the capital. He said the 1st
Army Brigade and air force paratroopers were put on alert.
   Police with assault rifles were posted throughout the capital
near dawn. Loaded troop trucks patrolled downtown and two
helicopters hovered over the marchers.
   ``We don't cry for the martyrs of July 30th, we imitate them
with combative struggle,'' the marchers chanted. ``Yankee invader,
El Salvador will be your tomb.''
   The only incident occurred when soldiers tried to prevent U.S.
journalist Chris Norton, doing work for the Christian Science
Monitor, from photographing a water cannon.
   They tried to handcuff him, then threw him to the ground before
other journalists came to his aid and identified him. The soldiers
then let Norton go.

   Convicted cocaine kingpin Roberto Suarez
Gomez told reporters Friday the U.S. government is responsible for
the cocaine problem and that he allowed himself to be captured
because he opposes drug trafficking.
   Eight Bolivian journalists were allowed to meet with Suarez
Gomez in the San Pedro Prison in La Paz.
   He was arrested 10 days ago at his ranch 350 miles east of La
Paz.
   ``I hold the Reagan administration totally responsible for the
great advance of this (drug) affliction against humanity because it
had the obligation to delineate an efficient policy to confront the
problem,'' Suarez Gomez told the reporters.
   They quoted him as saying,``Without taking credit away from the
police, I facilitated my capture precisely because I could not
continue to carry the guilt of traffickers on my shoulders. That is
why I decided to come and face the situation that awaited me and
clear up my situation.''
   He added: ``I am not the king of cocaine, but rather the king of
the fight against cocaine. I have always fought to keep the price
of cocaine high to save my people and humanity from the brutal
effects of trafficking.''
   Suarez Gomez, 57, was greeted with shouts of ``Long live the
king!'' by inmates when he arrived at the La Paz prison Tuesday
from another jail.
   He is serving a 15-year prison sentence imposed this year after
he was convicted, in absentia, of dealing with illegal drugs.
   Suarez Gomez was indicted in Florida in 1980. He was accused of
conspiring to ship 854 pounds of cocaine into the United States.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Admininistration spokesman Jack Hook has
said Suarez Gomez dealt in tons of cocaine.
   ``He could be considered one of the pioneers involved in
manufacturing and trafficking cocaine to the United States,'' Hook
said of Suarez Gomez.
   The prisoner also told the reporters that the cocaine trade has
a strong influence in the world of politics, but he did not give
any names of politicians who might have connections with drug
traffickers.
   Bolivia, an impoverished country with a population of 6.7
million, produces at least a third of the cocaine that reaches U.S.
and European markets, according to the DEA. It is estimated that
about 350,000 Bolivians depend for their livelihood on cultivating
coca leaves, processing them to be turned into cocaine or
trafficking.

<HEAD>States Along Mississippi Disagree Over Duck Hunting Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives from 14 states along the
Mississippi River disagreed Friday on how to restrict hunting to
ease pressure on a duck population crippled by years of habitat
destruction.
   Droughts this year and last added to the problem, which wildlife
services and hunting organizations in the United States and Canada
have battled for years, said Hugh Bateman, chief of the game
division of Louisiana.
   The Mississippi Flyway Council, which represents three Canadian
provinces and a corridor of states stretching to the Gulf of
Mexico, is meeting to decide on season and bag limit
recommendations it will present on Aug. 3 to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.
   Less than a decade ago many states had seasons of 50 days or
more. Last year, seasons averaged about 40 days in the flyway.
   The so-called upper flyway committee of the northern states
Friday decided to go along with federal suggestions for a 30-day
season, eding Jan. 1, and a four-duck bag limit.
   The lower flyway committee of the South went along with the
30-day season but wanted to continue the point system on the number
of ducks taken _ each duck worth so many points with the point
limit at 100 a day. For example, a Mallard would be worth 35 points.
   The real sticking point is the season's end.
   ``There is no way I can go for a January 1st date,'' said
Bateman, chairman of the lower flyway committee. ``In north
Louisiana, in Mississippi if you don't get the right weather you
have no duck hunting until Christmas. You're talking about a week's
season.''
   His panel agreed, proposing an ending date of Jan. 15.
   Both committees were to report Saturday to the full council for
a compromise.
   Federal wildlife experts say the flight population of ducks is
expected to be 66 million this year, the lowest since the record of
1985 when 62 million were estimated to have moved through the
flyway.
   Drought conditions have been a problem in the nesting grounds of
the Canadian prairies for much of the decade, according to a
federal report handed out at the council session.
   ``Moreover, agriculture activities continue to remove nesting
and brood breeding habitat from the landscape,'' said the report.
``The outlook for a rapid return to better breeding conditions and
much improved duck population is not good.''
   Upper flyway panel states are Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan,
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri.
   The southern states in the council are Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky.

   A convoy of 44 U.S. activists
delivered several tons of food, medicine and clothing to the
leftist Sandinista government Friday and President Daniel Ortega
praised them at a public ceremony.
   ``These people are representatives of the American people who
don't want war, they want peace,'' Ortega said to about 200 people
who gathered in Luis Alfonso Velazquez Park.
   Wounded Nicaraguan soldiers watched the ceremony and children
mobilized by the Sandinista Party chanted: ``Let's go to war, carry
the bullets!''
   The Veterans Peace Convoy, sponsored by a Washington-based
coalition of six activist groups, journeyed across Mexico and
Central America for two weeks after a dispute with the U.S. Customs
Service.
   Customs officials said the group, which includes many veterans,
would violate a 1985 economic embargo if they donated their
vehicles, as they plan to do. Humanitarian aid is allowed under the
embargo.
   ``While Reagan sends arms to the (rebel) Contras to murder our
children, he tried also to obstruct this caravan,'' Ortega said.
``He said they carried goods that threatened the security of the
United States.''
   Ortega had a child bring him a box of the goods and took out a
baby bottle. ``Look at the weapons they brought,'' he said, holding
it up. ``This is what Reagan did not want to arrive.''
   He screwed the top on the bottle. ``The weapon is ready to
fire,'' he announced. ``All it needs is milk.''
   Convoy member Raul Valdez spoke out against U.S. funding for the
rebels, known as Contras, who have been trying to overthrow
Nicaragua's leftist government for nearly seven years.
   ``This money that is sent to cause death here is being taken
away from our children,'' he said. ``Our taxes shouldn't be used to
kill Nicaraguans. It's unjust, immoral.''
   The activists were given military T-shirts and Sandinista army
hats. The ceremony ended with the Sandinista anthem, which
proclaims: ``We fight against the Yankees, enemies of humanity.''
   A convoy spokesman said the supplies would go to three
Sandinista organizations representing children, workers and women.
He also said 18 of the 20 vehicles would be left in Nicaragua with
party organizations, including labor unions.
   The operations of the Sandinista Party and the government are
closely intertwined in Nicaragua.
   When the veterans crossed the U.S. border, they were told they
faced fines of up to $50,000 each and 10 years in prison if they
did not bring the vehicles back within 30 days.
   A U.S. Treasury Department official in Washington, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Friday that no decision had been made
on whether to file charges against convoy members. He said the case
was under active review by the department's Office of Foreign
Assets Control.
   In June, U.S. Customs officials stopped the original convoy of
38 vehicles from crossing into Mexico. About 100 convoy
participants drove to Washington to demonstrate against the
decision, circling around the White House and in front of the State
Department for three days.
   Eight members of the group were arrested July 9 when they
refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a Rio Grande
bridge crossing at Laredo, Texas. The convoy finally crossed the
border July 14.
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada said thousands of people
greeted the convoy when it crossed the Honduran border Wednesday
into Nicaragua.

   Two environmental protesters came down from
their treetop perches into the waiting arms of sheriff's deputies
Friday after professional climbers scaled a tree and cut loose one
man's food and water.
   The tree-sitters had gone out on a limb in an attempt to stop
construction of a logging road and to prevent the taking of timber
in the remote section of the Siskiyou National Forest. The forest
is in Oregon's coastal mountains.
   ``It's inevitable,'' a protester who identified himself as Bald
Mountain Bill said after he rappelled down a rope from his perch 80
feet up a charred Douglas fir. ``Obviously, they're not going to
let us stop a $1 million road.''
   He and the deputies traded good-natured jibes during the 90
minutes between their arrival and the arrests.
   A woman also came down from her plywood perch lashed to a trunk
after watching two tree climbers who perform at timber carnivals
scale the other protester's tree and cut loose the small platform
holding his food and water.
   Authorities identified the tree-sitters as Cornelius P. Sinnott,
28, of nearby Cave Junction, and Denise Elke, 27, of Novato, Calif.
   Deputies arrested a third person on a ridge overlooking the
site. He was identified as Matthew D. Haun, 27, of Salt Lake City.
   All three were charged with trespassing.
   The environmental group Earth First! is fighting U.S. Forest
Service plans to extend a gravel road nearly a mile to allow
salvage logging. The area was burned last summer in Oregon's
biggest forest fire in 50 years, a 96,500-acre blaze.
   The timber industry contends the dead trees will otherwise go to
waste. Opponents argue that building roads and logging will promote
erosion that will damage salmon and steelhead spawning beds in
tributaries of the Illinois River.
   Earlier this month, the National Wildlife Federation failed in a
bid to get a court order stopping the road and the logging.
   Josephine County Sheriff Bill Arnado sent deputies Friday to
remove the protesters. The trees were cut down immediately after
their arrest. He said one tree-sitting protester escaped before
dawn today while deputies camped below.
   The three tree-sitters had taken the places of three who had
spent eight days in the trees before one of them was surprised and
arrested Wednesday evening while taking a break on the ground.
   The sheriff said deputies would be on 24-hour guard to keep
other protesters out of the trees.

<HEAD>China Blames Vietnam for Failure of Cambodian Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's official news agency Saturday blamed
Vietnam for blocking progress at this week's Cambodian peace talks
in Indonesia.
   The Xinhua News Agency said little was accomplished at the
meeting, which ended Thursday.
   It characterized Vietnam's stance at the talks as ``indeed
disappointing.'' The agency also said the Hanoi-backed government
in Cambodia ``had neither new ideas nor sincerity for the
solution.''
   The talks brought together for the first time Cambodia's leaders
and rebels from a three-party coalition, but they reached no
agreements on a solution to the nine-year conflict in Cambodia. The
sides agreed to set up a working group for further discussions.
   Vietnam said the talks led to some general progress, but the
strongest guerrilla faction, the Khmer Rouge, called that assertion
``a shameless lie.'' Cambodian Premier Hun Sen blamed lack of
progress on the Khmer Rouge.
   In its commentary, Xinhua said Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach and Hun Sen tried to take the initiative by holding
news conferences and putting forth a seven-point peace proposal.
   However, the news agency charged that ``their basic stand on
three key issues did not change at all.'' The commentary said
Vietnam refused to set a definite timetable for rapid withdrawal of
its troops, continued to insist on disarming the Khmer Rouge and
ousting it from the resistance coalition, and refused to dissolve
the current Phnom Penh government.
   Vietnam has pledged to withdraw its estimated 120,000 troops
from Cambodia by 1990, but it also demands assurances the Khmer
Rouge will not return to power. The Khmer Rouge ruled from 1975-78,
and are accused of killing more than a million people in a reign of
terror while trying to turn Cambodia into a primitive agrarian
society.
   China is the main supplier of arms and funds to the Khmer Rouge.
It also strongly supports the three-party resistance coalition.

   An oceanographer's study released Friday says the medical-type
waste washing ashore on northeastern beaches was probably dumped
near the mouth of New York Harbor in mid-June.
   The waste, including syringes, vials of blood and what appeared
to be hospital or clinic equipment, began appearing on New York's
Long Island in early July and in Rhode Island and Massachusetts
later in the month. It resulted in periodic beach closings.
   In New York City, two large beaches reopened to swimmers Friday
after authorities reported that only a small number of syringes and
other debris had washed ashore. But about 30 beaches along a
10-mile stretch from Pelham Manor to Rye on Long Island Sound were
closed to swimmers because of syringes washing up, and a popular
Long Island beach was closed because of sewage.
   Heavy rain in the Boston area this week prompted officials to
close beaches and ban shellfishing in some areas. The rain poured
more than 400 million gallons of dirty storm water into Boston
Harbor and neighboring streams.
   University of Rhode Island oceanographer Malcolm Spaulding said
the medical-type waste sightings in northeastern states are
consistent with a release in the V-shaped section of ocean leading
to New York Harbor on June 11-16.
   Rhode Island Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said he was sending copies
of the report to Govs. Mario Cuomo of New York and Thomas H. Kean
of New Jersey and urging them to crack down on waste dumping.
   ``It seems clear from this excellent scientific detective work
that our beaches are being fouled by wastes from other states,''
DiPrete said in a statement accompanying the report.
   Spaulding said his study was based on meteorological data from
the National Weather Service. He said he used the wind and current
data to both track the waste backward from where it was found and
forward from potential sources.
   On Friday, New York City Health Department spokesman Barry
Adkins said Rockaway Beach in the borough of Queens was reopened
because the amount of medical waste found, including nine syringes,
was not considered significant.
   Although authorities refer to the problem as medical waste, they
say many of the syringes could have come from individual diabetics
or drug users. The waste has not been linked to any hospital or
clinic.
   Long Beach, a popular Long Island bathing spot, was closed
Friday after sewage debris was seen floating in the water. The
beach, along a four mile stretch of western Nassau County, will
remain closed until health inspectors can ensure that the water
quality is safe, according to Nassau County Health Department
spokeswoman Shelly Domash.

<HEAD>Anglicans Seek Compromise on Issue of Woman Bishop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A compromise shaped up from private
discussions at the Lambeth Conference Friday on the issue of
consecrating the first women bishop in the Anglican church.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, head of the Anglican
communion, has said that although all Anglican churches probably
would accept women priests, a woman bishop could split the
communion. The U.S. Episcopal church and New Zealand church are
considering consecrating women bishops.
   The 525 bishops representing 70 million Anglicans in 164
countries will debate the issue Monday at the Lambeth Conference.
   A compromise resolution drafted Friday by John Neill, bishop of
Tuam in Ireland, urges the conference to respect differences of
opinion.
   It says the conference recognizes ``the serious hurt which would
result from the questioning of the validity of the episcopal acts
of a woman bishop, and likewise the hurt experienced by those whose
conscience would be offended by the ordination of a woman to the
episcopate.
   ``The church needs to exercise sensitivity, patience and
pastoral care toward all concerned.
   ``While addressing the issue we have tried to stress the deep
hurt that will be involved both ways among those who are offended
by it and by those who do not feel it goes far enough.''
   Archbishop Donald Robinson of Sydney, Australia, introduced a
resolution saying women should not be consecrated as bishops ``for
the avoidance of further impairment of communion both within and
between the churches.''
   Monday's debate will come at the start of the last week of the
three-week conference.
   This is the first Lambeth Conference to be held in 10 years.
Each of the 27 Anglican churches worldwide is self-governing but
they look to the Church of England for guidance and Runcie is the
world Anglican leader.
   The last Lambeth Conference in 1978 evaded the issue of women
priests by saying all the member churches should respect each
other's decisions. The question of a woman bishop did not arise at
that time.
   According to conference statistics, some 1,200 women have been
admitted to the priesthood by a minority of the Anglican churches,
most of them in the United States, Canada and New Zealand.
   Opponents say the concept of woman priests does not exist in
Bible teaching. They also say that bishops are considered the
successors of Christ's Apostles, who were men, and if a woman
bishop is consecrated some churches might leave the communion on
grounds she could not be in communion with the other bishops.

<TEXT>
   A pipe bomb exploded early Friday in a
mailbox at Salem, just hours after a similar bomb was discovered in
the county courthouse at South Bend, about 200 miles to the north,
authorities said.
   No one was injured in the Salem explosion, and damage was minor,
police said. The bomb found in the St. Joseph County courthouse was
removed safely and detonated by police explosives experts.
   In Indianapolis, police said eight sticks of dynamite were found
Thursday in a city park, but were not wired to explode, police
said. ``I have no idea if there is a connection, or if it is a
copycat thing,'' said Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Robert Ward.
   Since early July, a variety of explosive devices have been
planted in four Indiana communities. No arrests have been made, and
investigators have established no connection among the incidents.
   The bomb that detonated about 12:45 a.m. at Salem High School
was the second to explode in the state in a week. An exploding bomb
destroyed a door at a Loogootee school the night of July 22,
causing about $500 damage but injuring no one.
   In the first Salem incident on July 5, 13 dynamite time bombs
were discovered scattered around the city, prompting the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to send an investigative
team from Washington.
   ATF agent James M. Vaughn said in Louisville, Ky., that he does
not believe the two Salem incidents are related. Investigators also
discount the possibility of a link with the explosion at Loogootee,
about 50 miles west of Salem, said Vaughn.
   In South Bend, the investigation is being handled by city and
county authorities. On Wednesday a section of pipe wired to a
battery and timing device, but containing no explosives, was found
on a city street. ``We are not discounting the theory that the
incidents are connected,'' said sheriff's Cpl. Charles Feirrell.
   The courthouse bomb was found around 8 p.m. by a cleaning worker
in a basement restroom, said Sheriff Joseph Nagy. Police evacuated
six employees who had remained after office hours and routed
traffic away from the courthouse. The bomb was removed by a
remote-operated pulley and exploded at a gravel pit outside the
city, police said.
   The dynamite used in the original Salem bombs was traced to a
theft of dynamite last month from a crushed stone quarry in
English, about 30 miles southwest of Salem, investigators say.
   Investigators said the bombs were improperly wired. Three of the
bombs ignited, but did not explode, and produced only smoke and
small fires. The Indiana Arson Crime Association and ATF each have
offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and
conviction.

   The movie ``Cry Freedom''
opened in more than 30 South African theaters Friday with the
censor's approval, but police said it threatened public safety and
seized the copies seven hours later.
   They cited two bombs, anonymous phone threats and violent scenes
in the movie as evidence that it was dangerous.
   Movie-goers at the Northcliff Theater in a rich white
Johannesburg suburb arrived to find posters being taken down and
police ready to confiscate the film. ``Cry Freedom'' was replaced
by ``I Was A Teen-Age Vampire.''
   Richard Attenborough, who directed the movie, said in London:
``I never believed they would show it. ... The overall reason for
making the film was to tell people the truth about apartheid, and
about how it struck both black and white South Africans.''
   Nomphelo Ndabula, 19, emerged from a theater in tears. ``I was
nearly heartbroken,'' she said. ``The people, especially whites,
must see the film. They will see that the black man must have
rights. They will see that blacks are people.''
   In Los Angeles, Tom Pollock, chairman of the MCA Motion Picture
Group, said of the police action: ``We at Universal Pictures
condemn the actions of the government of South Africa. However, we
applaud the courage of UIP, the film's overseas distributor, and
local theater owners throughout South Africa who agreed to play the
film despite the controversy and pressure.''
   Glenn Gumpel, executive director of the Directors Guild of
America, issued a statement saying, ``We abhor any censorship,
wherever found in the world, and are appalled by the actions of the
South African government.'' Attenborough is a guild member.
   The Publication Appeals Board ruled Friday morning, for the
second time, that the film could be shown. It said the movie, which
depicts the death in detention in 1977 of young black consciousness
leader Steve Biko, was biased against police but did not endanger
race relations or state security.
   Gen. Hendrik de Witt, the police commissioner, declared in a
statement Friday evening that the film ``endangers the safety of
the public, the maintenance of public order, and will delay the
termination of the state of emergency'' imposed on June 12, 1986.
   Minister of Information Stoffel van der Merwe said the
government decided to override the board because the censors could
not judge ``the situation on the streets.''
   ``The security forces are portrayed in such a negative light
that their public image would be seriously undermined,'' he said.
``Whites are typified as privileged and surrounded by wealth, as
opposed to blacks living in great poverty and subjected to
exploitation and repression.''
   Van der Merwe said those portrayals were not accurate.
   South Africa's apartheid system establishes a society in which
the 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate
residential districtes, schools, health services and recreation
areas.
   The movie, directed by Attenborough in neighboring Zimbabwe, is
based on two books by Donald Woods, a white newspaper editor who
befriended Biko and fled the country after Biko's death.
   Woods is banned in South Africa and it is illegal to quote him,
as actor Kevin Kline does in portraying him, but De Witt did not
mention that point in ordering the copies confiscated under
emergency regulations.
   Explosions, but no injuries, were reported at two theaters
showing ``Cry Freedom.'' The blast at the Metro theater in downtown
Durban occurred soon after police evacuated a multiracial crowd of
300 and the other was at Kings Cinema in Alexandra, a black
township outside Johannesburg.
   Theaters in Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, Durban and in Soweto, the
largest black township near Johannesburg, reported receiving
anonymous bomb threats.
   The censorship board approved the film without restrictions in
November. It was to open in April but distributors withdrew it,
asking for assurances no one would be prosecuted for showing the
film. The government made no promises.
   Stoffel Botha, home affairs minister, ordered the board this
week to review its decision. The censors held a hearing Thursday
and announced Friday morning the movie could be shown with an age
restriction of 19.
   Showings began half an hour later.
   Van der Merwe told a news conference the movie was intended as
an anti-South Africa propaganda instrument, and ``We don't need
that sort of internal disturbance and excitement from people like
Richard Attenborough.''
   Police reported threats and violence at one theater but did not
name it. There were no reports of such disturbances from
journalists who joined audiences around the country.
   ``I don't think people will go out and riot because it's about
events we all know about,'' said a black youth at the Kine Theater
in Johannesburg. He would not give his name.
   The audience of 200, most of them black teen-agers, jumped
forward in their seats and hissed during the scene at the end in
which white policemen open fire on marching Soweto schoolchildren
in 1976.
   Sobs also could be heard. People sat with hands in front of
their mouths. The hissing grew when the camera showed patches of
blood on the children's crisp, white school shirts.
   Several blacks sang softly along with the soundtrack of ``God
Bless Africa,'' which many blacks consider to be their national
anthem.
   It ends with the shout, ``Amandla!'' the Zulu word for power.
Many viewers joined the shout, then the audience filed out without
waiting for the credits.

<HEAD>Government Closes Visa Loophole For Tennis Stars, Golfers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian government closed a loophole Friday
that allowed South African tennis stars, golfers and other athletes
to compete in Canada despite a Commonwealth ban on sporting links
with South Africa.
   Foreign Minister Joe Clark said in the future, individuals
traveling on South African passports and seeking entry into Canada
to participate in a sports event will be denied visas.
   The change means that South African tennis players Gary Muller
and Christo van Rensburg, scheduled to compete in next week's
Canadian Open tennis tournament in Toronto, will be denied visas.
   The minister told Parliament earlier this week that he intended
to close the loophole in a 1977 agreement that encourages
Commonwealth countries to combat apartheid by discouraging contact
or competition with athletes from South Africa.
   Ambassador Johannes Hendrik de Klerk of South Africa reacted to
that announcement by saying sports in his country had been fully
integrated for years.
   ``Isolating individual South African sportsmen and women can
make no positive contribution towards change in South Africa,'' de
Klerk said.
   Opposition members of Parliament pointed out that the agreement
was effective against sports teams from South Africa, but
individuals were entering the country on business visas.
   Clark said his action ``is fully in keeping with the major role
the Canadian government has played in the international struggle
against apartheid.''
   Next week, the Commonwealth committee of foreign ministers on
Southern Africa will meet in Toronto to review the fight against
apartheid, although no new sanctions are expected. Clark is
chairman of the eight-member committee.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which
South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.
The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Light Source At Bottom Of Pacific</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREA BLANDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is light at the bottom of the deep dark
seas, scientists say they have discovered off the Washington coast.
   A group of scientists headed by University of Washington
oceanographers said they photographed the ocean-bottom light at
hydrothermal vents 180 miles off the Washington coast.
   The vents, openings along the ridges where the plates of the
Earth's surface meet, spew out 650-degree water that has picked up
minerals in the seabed.
   The light confirms a hypothesis that Cindy Lee Van Dover, 34, a
graduate student in oceanography in a joint Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
program, has been working on for two years.
   The discovery also ends the long-held scientific belief that
there is no light at the ocean bottoms, said John Delaney, 46, UW
professor of oceanography and lead scientist for the dive.
   Ms. Van Dover, after whom the light has been named the ``Van
Dover Glow,'' began her research in the summer of 1986 on live
shrimp that crowded together around Atlantic Ocean hot springs
feeding on bacteria. The creatures lack normal shrimp eyes.
   Ms. Van Dover said she noticed large organs beneath their shells
that had no lenses, but otherwise looked like eyes. Further study
proved the organs were light-sensitive, although they could not
form images.
   ``If hot springs glow, then the shrimp would be able to use the
organs to lead them to the glow, and hence, to food,'' Ms. Van
Dover hypothesized.
   Tuesday, during the research submersible Alvin's final
2,200-meter dive, which is nearly 1.4 miles below sea level, the
scientists said they finally proved the hypothesis.
   Submarine pilot Dudley Foster held the vessel steady enough
against strong currents for a camera to take 20-second exposures of
the hot springs.
   When processed, the images showed light coming from two
different hot springs, the scientists said.
   The university announced the findings before the scientists
could publish them in any journal where they would be subject to
peer review.
   Ms. Van Dover said scientists do not yet know what produces the
light, but it could be because the minerals in the water heat up so
much they glow or it could be due to a chemical reaction.
   The light could offer some new possibilities to theories of
evolution of living creatures, Ms. Van Dover said.
   ``The thought that there could be photosynthesis (using light to
produce food) down there is an entirely new idea,'' she said.
``There has been a lot of thought on the origin of life and how
deep-sea life may have played in it.''
   The Alvin is scheduled to make another dive in four weeks, and
Delaney said either he or Ms. Van Dover will be aboard. The two are
considering experiments for that trip including identifying the
color of the light, its wavelength and measuring how far it
penetrates through the water, Delaney said.

   Maria DeSillers refused Friday to give her
fingerprints to police, who said they have new evidence in the
investigation of how she handled donations for her dying son's
liver transplants.
   Dade County prosecutors have been looking into Mrs. DeSillers'
handling of more than $689,000 donated for her 7-year-old son
Ronnie, who died in April 1987 awaiting his fourth liver transplant.
   Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Joseph Gerwens said new
developments from the investigation prompted his department to
issue a search warrant for the finger and palm prints of Mrs.
DeSillers and several others.
   He refused to elaborate on the information, saying only that no
arrests have been made.
   Mrs. DeSillers' Miami attorney, Roy Black, filed a motion in
Dade Circuit Court Friday, saying issuance of a search warrant for
the woman's fingerprints is ``an invasion of her body.''
   Judge Ralph Person scheduled an emergency hearing on the matter
Monday.
   Repeated telephone calls to Mrs. DeSillers' home by The
Associated Press resulted in a busy signal. Fred Kerstein, who is
handling the Dade County investigation, refused to comment.
   Ronnie, born with defective liver ducts, first attracted
national attention after a February 1987 robbery at St. Anthony's
Roman Catholic School in Fort Lauderdale, in which $4,000 collected
by schoolmates was taken.
   News of the incident prompted a nationwide outpouring of
donations for Ronnie's medical care, including a $1,000 gift from
President Reagan.
   Gerwens refused to say whether the fingerprints are related to
the parochial school robbery.
   Mrs. DeSillers has refused to pay $262,000 in medical bills to
Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, saying her son received improper
care.
   A court-appointed caretaker of the donated funds said Mrs.
DeSillers improperly used $200,000 of the money on luxury items
ranging from jewelry to a BMW sports car.
   On Thursday, a Dade Circuit judge ruled that she is not entitled
to the remaining $240,000 of the donated money and that it should
instead pay medical bills, debts and help other needy ill children.

<HEAD>South Atlantic Nations Condemn Apartheid, Shun Waste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented meeting of 22
South Atlantic nations ended Friday with a call for sanctions
against South Africa and an end to transferring nuclear and toxic
waste to the region.
   The participants also called on Argentina and Great Britain to
reach a definitive peace settlement in their dispute over the
Falkland Islands, off the Argentine coast.
   Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and 19 African nations signed the
declaration at the end of the five-day meeting, the first of its
kind for the region.
   The 22 countries met at Brazil's invitation to create a ``zone
of peace and cooperation'' in the South Atlantic. The concept
involves keeping the region free of military bases and nuclear arms
in accordance with a 1986 U.N. resolution.
   The countries voted to ``condemn the abhorrent policy of the
racist regime of apartheid in South Africa, the continued illegal
occupation and colonial domination of Namibia, South African acts
of aggression against Angola and other neighboring states.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   The 22 nations recognized SWAPO, the South West Africa People's
Organization, as the ``sole and legitimate'' representative of
Namibia, also known as South-West Africa.
   The group endorsed ``the imposition of comprehensive and
mandatory sanctions against the South African regime.''
   The statement also urged joint efforts to block transfer of
toxic waste to the South Atlantic. Countries in West Africa have
recently shown mounting concern over the dumping of garbage there
from Western nations, including the United States.
   The participants called on Argentina and Great Britain to
continue talks on the future of the Falkland Islands, which
Argentina calls the Malvinas. Argentina claims it owns the
British-held islands and waged an unsuccessful war in 1982 to take
them over.

   A lawyer who won acquittal two weeks ago for a
suspected guerrilla leader was found shot to death on an oceanside
highway near Lima, the Interior Ministry said Friday.
   It said Manuel Febres Flores, 45, was killed Thursday morning
and his body was recovered hours later, with no identification.
Police said he was beaten and was shot seven times.
   Febres Flores, a member of a laywers' group accused by the
government of having ties to the leftist Shining Path guerrillas,
successfully defended Osman Morote against terrorism charges and
won his acquittal.
   The president of the Association of Democratic Lawyers, Alfredo
Crespo, blamed a ``repressive instrument of the government'' for
the killing.
   A group calling itself the Rodrigo Franco Democratic Front,
after an official slain by the Maoist-oriented Shining Path last
year, called Lima newspapers and claimed responsibility for the
death, reporters said.
   Government officials denied any knowledge of the group and the
Interior Ministry vowed to track down Febres Flores' killers.
   The government considers Morote the Shining Path's No. 2 leader
and military strategist. Morote was cleared for lack of evidence
but remains in jail facing other terrorism charges.
   In his state of the nation address Thursday, President Alan
Garcia, head of the left-of-center Aprista Party, condemned
Morote's acquittal and demanded tougher anti-terrorism laws.
   Crespo told The Associated Press that members of the lawyers'
association have been receiving death threats for six months. The
association frequently defends people accused as guerrillas and is
considered a Shining Path front by the government.
   The Shining Path insurgency began eight years ago. The
government says it has claimed 15,000 lives and caused $10 billion
in damage. The Shining Path, which has no known ties to any
guerrilla organization in Latin America or elsewhere, seeks to
overthrow the government and create a communist state.

<TEXT>
   Hungarian leader Karoly Grosz, ending a 30-hour
visit to Canada after a U.S. tour, said Friday that reforms in his
country will not include loosening Communist Party control.
   Grosz, premier and head of the Communist Party, said Western
capital is necessary to help finance economic progress in his
country but Hungary is not prepared for a political system with
more than one party.
   ``This is not timely today in Hungary,'' he told a news
conference. ``I've seen countries in the world having a multiparty
system and still having no democracy.''
   Two weeks ago, the Hungarian Communist Party's Central Committee
approved economic and political reforms that include the creation
of a ``socialist market economy'' and legalizing the framework for
a pluralist party system.
   Grosz said the reforms will not undermine the goals of communism.
   ``We want a socialist system that works better,'' he said. ``If
a theory is carried out in a mistaken way, this doesn't necessarily
mean the system is not working.''
   Grosz, who has acknowledged the failure of austerity measures he
pursued after becoming premier in June 1987, said joint business
ventures between Hungarian industries and foreign corporations are
a key to overcoming the nation's economic stagnation.
   ``But I wouldn't like the Hungarian government to engage in
doing business, that's up to businessmen,'' he said.
   After a 55-minute meeting with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,
Grosz said the Canadian leader ``agreed 100 percent with all the
ideas I put forward.'' There was no comment from Mulroney.
   Grosz also met hydroelectric, atomic energy and
telecommunications company executives to discuss possible joint
ventures.
   He refused to meet with Hungarian-Canadian human rights
activists angry at Romania's resettlement plans that include the
elimination of about 7,000 villages populated mainly by ethnic
Hungarians.
   Grosz said Hungary has sent a protest letter to the Romanian
government and added: ``As for the refugees (coming from Romania),
we accept all those who ask for the right to stay with us in
Hungary.''

   The Inter-American Court of Human
Rights on Friday found the Honduran government guilty in the 1981
disappearance of a student in police custody and ordered it to pay
damages to the man's family.
   A government spokesman said Honduras will comply with the order,
the first verdict handed down by the court.
   The decision in the case of Angel Manfredo Velasquez, 35, a
university student leader, came after an eight-month trial.
   The court is an agency of the Organization of American States
based in San Jose, the capital of neighboring Costa Rica. Its seven
international jurists are handling other cases of Central American
citizens who disappeared while in custody or suffered other human
rights abuses.
   Honduras' independent Human Rights Commission claims 150 people
have disappeared in Honduras during the past eight years, and
another 800 have been slain for political motives.
   Velasquez, a leftist, was a student at the National University's
College of Economics when police arrested him Sept. 8, 1981, during
the rightist military government of Gen. Policapo Paz Garcia. He
has not been heard from since.
   Student and labor activists protested his disappearance at the
time and several armed groups briefly invaded radio stations,
newspapers, news agencies and other media to press demands for an
investigation.
   Lisando Quesada, a spokesman for President Jose Azcona Hoyo,
told reporters: ``Velasquez's family will be (compensated) by the
state because Honduras faithfully complies with obligations under
international agreements.''
   Quesada refused to say how much the compensation will be.
   Ramon Custodio, president of the Human Rights Commission, said
he was satisfied with the court's decision and hoped it will mark a
new stage in respect for human rights in the region.
   ``Let us hope this case constitutes a starting point for wider
investigations on abuses of human life in Latin America,'' he said.
   Honduras had denied the charges against it, but two key
witnesses in the case were shot to death in the Central American
nation in January in what human rights advocates claim was an
effort by death squads to silence their critics.

   Folk singer Pete Seeger and New York City
activist Al Sharpton were sentenced to 15 days in jail Friday on
disorderly conduct charges stemming from a racially charged
demonstration over an alleged rape.
   Albany Police Court Judge Thomas Keegan also found 10 others
guilty of disorderly conduct for disrupting traffic during an April
4 demonstration near the state Capitol in Albany. The protesters
claim racism in the investigation of a claim by Tawana Brawley, a
black Wappingers Falls teen-ager, that she was abducted and raped
by six white men last November.
   Two defendants were acquitted after the three-day, non-jury
trial. One of those acquitted, Rodney Stewart, had tears running
down his face as he said he wanted to join the others as they were
taken directly to jail.
   As he was led out of court, Sharpton, a minister who also is the
subject of state and federal investigations into his financial
dealings, raised his fist and shouted, ``Tell Cuomo to straighten
this out!''
   Sharpton and two other Brawley advisers, New York City lawyers
Alton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason, have accused New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo of racism because he appointed the state attorney
general, rather than a prosecutor of their choosing, to look into
the Brawley case.
   A handful of demonstrators in court briefly chanted ``No
justice, no peace'' following the sentencing.
   The defendants, who all got 15 days in jail, were led away to
begin serving their sentences immediately at the Albany County Jail.
   Maddox, who represented all the defendants except Seeger, called
the decision a ``political hit.''
   ``It's clear the Constitution does not apply to Al Sharpton,
Pete Seeger and any other people who support the elimination of
racism and discrimination and particularly those who support Tawana
Brawley,'' Maddox said.
   Maddox said after the sentencing he was searching for a judge
that he could ask to grant bail Friday evening pending appeal of
the demonstrators' convictions.
   Maddox had argued that the defendants were exercising their
constitutional right to free speech in the demonstration.
   Assistant Albany County District Attorney Steven Dougherty
focused his case on whether the demonstrators ignored repeated
warnings by police to disperse when they tried to block traffic. He
said the demonstrators could have gotten off with fines if they had
not insisted on a trial.
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams has said his inquiry will
probably end without the arrest of any suspects because Miss
Brawley and her family will not cooperate, on the advice of
Sharpton, Mason and Maddox.

   Higher humidity Friday gave firefighters
the upper hand against a 3,000-acre forest fire that had destroyed
15 homes on the western edge of the city, but it remained the
top-priority fire in the nation.
   ``We're very confident today,'' said Steve Gallegos, fire
incident commander. He said the fire was 90 percent contained by
afternoon.
   Only a wisp of smoke was visible during the afternoon, drifting
with light wind.
   ``If the weather holds we're pretty confident that no other
structures will be lost,'' fire information officer Rich Homann
said.
   Homann said much of Friday was spent strengthening fire
containment lines.
   Firefighters said they hoped to contain the arson blaze by early
Saturday and control it by Sunday. That was the first time since
the fire started Tuesday that firefighters had given an estimate of
when they might get a handle on the blaze in the forested Black
Hills.
   ``It's looking a lot more positive than it has,'' said fire
information officer Mike Ball.
   Hundreds of people had evacuated their homes from several
subdivisions in and around the forest, and all but 125 people were
allowed to return home by Friday evening.
   Gene Ickler, who left his home on Wednesday, said he didn't know
what to expect when he returned Friday. The fire burned to within a
few feet of his house, but it was not damaged.
   ``You feel like doing a cartwheel to see your home standing,''
he said. ``The emotions really run.''
   Fire crews in Yellowstone National Park, where about 93,000
acres of forest has burned, took the calculated risk Friday of
setting their own fires in dead timber and brush to rob major fires
of fuel paths to building complexes.
   Park officials said the south entrance to the park will reopen
Sunday because the danger of fire reaching buildings around the Old
Faithful geyser had been significantly reduced.
   Fires fed by drought-dried fields and forests also blackened
regions of Alaska, Montana, Idaho, California, Washington and
Wisconsin. But all of Utah's fires had been tamed by Friday,
officials said.
   Humidity of 40 percent to 50 percent was expected to slow the
Rapid City fire, Ball said.
   ``Last night firefighters were able to work on that line that
they've been trying to complete in the southeast along Highway
44,'' Ball said Friday. Crews working by hand finished burning all
the fuel between the edge of the fire and the fire line.
   Flames jumped the highway at one point but only about 20 acres
burned on the other side before the fire was extinguished, said
Mary Sue Waxler, spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service.
   The blaze licking into housing developments in hills along the
western edge of this city of 50,000 people was the top priority
fire in the nation, Homann said.
   ``That basically means that when resources are requested for
this fire we will receive first priority,'' he said.
   Members of volunteer fire departments from around the state
saved 100 houses Thursday with an estimated value of $3.7 million,
Ball said. Those departments had brought 65 fire trucks to the area
to pump water onto threatened houses. A local businessman and his
father have started a fund for the firefighters, saying they should
be rewarded for their work.
   ``Firefighters are really risking their lives to protect
structures as well as they can,'' Homann said. ``One house had the
aluminum window sills melted out of it, and firemen were still able
to save the house.''
   In addition, National Guard helicopters carried hundreds of
loads of water to dump on buildings in the path of the fire.
   Considering that the fire spread over 600 more acres of housing
areas Thursday, firefighters did well to lose only eight houses
that day, said Waxler.
   The fire also had destroyed 40 outbuildings and more than 40
vehicles.
   Elsewhere, 10 families driven from their cabins in two
developments in a mountainous area northeast of Boise, Idaho,
because of the 4,600-acre Willis Gulch fire were allowed to return
home Friday night.
   More crews joined firefighters on the lines Friday, raising the
number of firefighters to more than 970.
   Firefighters in Yellowstone revised the number of acres burned
from 95,000 down to about 93,000 after aerial infrared mapping in
the 2.2 million acre park, which is the size of Delaware and Rhode
Island combined.
   On the 10,100-acre Shoshone fire, which forced the closure of
the park's Grant Village and threatened buildings in the complex,
officials got part way through a planned 300-acre burnout designed
to put a quarter-mile buffer around the village.
   Heli-torches _ flame throwers on helicopters _ were used to set
burnouts on the northeast flank of the 8,800-acre North Fork fire,
which threatened the large hotel and services complex surrounding
the Old Faithful geyser.
   ``We're happy with the burnout so far,'' said fire spokesman
Brian Fox. ``Once we get the northeast head of the fire dealt with,
it can go north, away from Old Faithful.''

   The high heels, bunny tails and
figure-shaping costumes that transformed cocktail-serving into a
sexual fantasy will be just a memory Saturday, when America's last
Playboy Club closes.
   The Playboy Club in a Lansing hotel was filled to its 250-patron
capacity on Friday night for one last party, and 60 people ended up
standing outside.
   ``I want to grab a cottontail,'' said 42-year-old Bill McDonald.
   ``This is the first and last time I'll be here, so it's worth a
wait,'' said Lynda Nagle, who had never been to the Lansing club
but had fond memories of visits to the Playboy Club in Detroit more
than a dozen years ago.
   ``The food was great, the atmosphere was great. It was a place
to go to meet executive-type husband material,'' she said.
   Inside, Milos Tavorsky, a quiet man of ``around 60,'' sat alone
at the end of the bar, watching the camera crews and shaking his
head.
   Tavorsky said he'd been a three-times-a-week patron for the past
four years and couldn't remember a time when it was as crowded.
   ``A week ago there weren't 20 people hre,'' he said. ``This is
something.''
   Outside in a hallway, bunny Michelle _ even on the last night
they obeyed the rules about revealing their last names _ was taking
a snapshot of the waiting crowd while bunny Rochelle posed for with
a beaming man who tipped her $10 and whispered his hotel room
number.
   Rochelle just rolled her eyes.
   ``We get a lot of this,'' she said.
   Rochelle, a bunny for two years, said the last week had been
tough on America's last nine bunnies, though tips were good.
``There's few girls, so it's been difficult to take care of the
quantity of people,'' she said.
   On Saturday, the Playboy trappings _ oversized posters of
magazine covers and other memorabilia _ were to be auctioned for
charity.
   The custom-fit bunny costumes, however, will not be on the
auction block, said Playboy spokeswoman Terri Tomcsin in Chicago.
   ``Those go back to Playboy Enterprises,'' she said.
   Hugh Hefner opened the first Playboy Club in Chicago in 1960 and
the clubs had their heyday in the 1970s, when there were 22 around
the world.
   The company-owned clubs were closed in 1986, and the three
remaining franchise contracts _ with hotels in Des Moines, Iowa;
Omaha, Neb.; and Lansing _ were not renewed this year, Tomcsin said.
   Thriving clubs remain in Japan and the Philippines, and Tomcsin
said the company plans more overseas operations.
   Tomcsin said she has been surprised by the media attention the
Lansing closing received.
   ``We just had a big deal with the last of the company-owned
clubs,'' she said. ``That was different. We had been around for 26
years. We were very established. The Lansing club opened in '82 _
you can't really compare.''
   Tomscin said the media attention shows the Playboy philosophy
had an impact on America. ``We were more than just a fad,'' she
said. ``We had become an important part of American culture.
   Writer Gloria Steinem, who once took a job as a bunny to write
an expose, offered a different perspective.
   ``I think that Playboy clubs were based on sexual repression of
men and economic, kind of, oppression of women and I'm glad to say
both things are ending,'' Steinem said in an interview with ABC
News.
   Officials at the Lansing Hilton said the closing announcement
boosted business at the club, which scrapped the key cards and let
in the general public in 1987.
   ``Business has increased four or five times,'' said Hilton
general manager Rick Barrett. ``I think a lot of people realize
it's the end of a bit of Americana.'

<HEAD>Newly Merged Party Names Ex-Commando as Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newly merged Social and Liberal Democratic
Party on Thursday elected a former Royal Marine commando, Paddy
Ashdown, as its first leader.
   Ashdown, 47, a member of Parliament since 1983, faced a tough
fight to restore the flagging fortunes of Britain's centrist,
third-ranking political movement. Its ratings have slumped in
acrimony over the merger, which was made final last March.
   Ashdown defeated Alan Beith, by 41,401 votes to 16,202, in a 72
percent turnout by the party membership after a lackluster
campaign. Both men formerly belonged to the Liberal Party.
   Ashdown said after his election that the new party had three
years _ until to the next election _ to supplant the opposition
Labor Party as the only prospect of providing a viable alternative
to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.
   ``I don't underestimate the scale of the task,'' Ashdown said in
a television interview. ``But if I didn't believe we could do that
I wouldn't be doing this job.''
   The Liberals precipitated the merger after their electoral
alliance with the Social Democratic Party failed at the last
election in June 1987 to break the power grip of the Conservatives
and Labor..
   Social Democratic leader David Owen, a former foreign secretary,
refused to merge and has maintained a breakaway faction as a
separate party, thus splitting the already minority centrist vote.
   Liberal Party leader David Steel, who did not run for the
leadership of the new party, blamed the alliance's disappointing
showing in 1987 partly on having two leaders.
   The alliance took 22.5 percent of the vote, down from one-fourth
at the previous general election in 1983.
   The centrists' ratings in the latest poll, by Harris last week,
were down to 7 percent for the Social and Liberal Democratic Party
and 3 percent for Owen's faction.
   Ashdown, who represents Yeovil in southwest England, served in
the Royal Navy's elite, undercover Special Boat Service in the Far
East and later as a Royal Marine captain in the Middle East and
Northern Ireland, before turning diplomat.

<TEXT>
   Two gunmen wearing hardhats, masks and
sunglasses pistol-whipped a guard and stole more than $300,000 from
an armored car outside a bank, authorities said.
   The robbers fled, and an automobile matching witnesses'
description of their getaway car was found in a residential area
six blocks from the Wells Fargo bank branch office, said FBI
spokesman Tom Griffin. No arrests were made.
   Griffin said more than one shot was fired during the robbery,
but he did not elaborate.
   A guard in the Loomis Armored Inc. armored truck was struck in
the forehead with a gun by one of the robbers. The guard was
hospitalized and reported in good condition.
   Kim Kellog, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo at the company's
headquarters in San Francisco, said the robbery occurred as the
Loomis truck arrived to deliver currency and coins to the branch
office. She confirmed that ``more than $300,000'' was taken.
   Investigators said the suspects attacked one of the guards at
the rear of the car as he prepared to make a delivery.
   ``They immediately started hitting him on the head with a
handgun,'' said police spokesman Sgt. Bob Burns. ``We don't know if
the shot was fired accidentally or if he fired a shot to frighten
him.''

   A U.S. drug enforcement official says former
White House staffer Oliver L. North suggested in 1984 that $1.5
million designated for a drug sting operation be diverted to the
Nicaraguan Contras instead.
   Ron Caffrey, now in charge of the Atlanta office of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, told a House panel Thursday the DEA
rejected the idea. Caffrey said he told North the suggestion would
have compromised the chief operative in one of the agency's most
significant undercover operations.
   As it turned out, according to Caffrey and other DEA witnesses,
the investigation was compromised anyway _ and closed prematurely _
several weeks later when details were leaked to the Washington

refuse to give their names remain jailed, most vowing to stay until
their next court date or the city frees them.
   Lawyers said Thursday that the jailed protesters, charged with
criminal trespass, cannot be freed on bond until they give

   The nation's biggest brokerage house said Thursday it had fired

   The Reagan administration says the federal
deficit will be $5.6 billion higher than it predicted back in
February, with the government's red ink now estimated to total
$152.3 billion this fiscal year.
   While the new administration estimate released Thursday is
higher, it is still below the more gloomy projections earlier this
year by many private economists, who were forecasting a deficit of
$160 billion or worse.
   Those economists have been busy revising their own figures, and
some now say the administration's new deficit forecast for the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30 may actually be too pessimistic.

Gorbachev urged pruning the Communist Party to exclude all but the

   The Soviet leader asked the Communist Party Central Committee to
have the parliament meet in November to make constitutional changes

unclear from the report whether the committee adopted all of
Gorbachev's proposals.
   Gorbachev's proposal calls for multicandidate elections to a new
2,250-member Congress of Peoples' Deputies, which in turn would
choose a full-time parliament of at least 400 members and a

   The United States hopes to pay $188 million of
its debt to the United Nations before the year is out, to help
prevent the world body from running out of money when it may need
to mount a peacekeeping operation in the Persian Gulf, U.N.
Ambassador Vernon Walters said Friday.
   Walters told reporters he is ``guardedly optimistic'' that a
cease-fire will be arranged to halt the Iran-Iraq war, and
estimated initial costs of a U.N. peacekeeping force at $15 million
to $20 million.
   Walters, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said that if progress is reached at resolving other
world problems _ including the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan,
the Cuban presence in Angola, a transition to independence for
Namibia, and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia _ the U.N. could
face an annual peacekeeping bill of more than $1.5 billion.

<TEXT>
   Nickelodeon's ``Nick at Nite'' service knows
its audience is the TV generation, so it will expand its lineup
this fall to include more old comedies and a new but old-style
cartoon series from animator Ralph Bakshi.
   ``The Patty Duke Show'' comes to the cable channel's night-time
lineup of nostalgia, which already includes such classics as ``Mr.
Ed,'' ``My Three Sons,'' ``The Donna Reed Show'' and ``Make Room
for Daddy.''
   Nickelodeon is also adding two more contemporary comedy
showcases. Beginning Sept. 12, viewers can see ``The Best of
`Saturday Night Live'' and ``SCTV'' back-to-back nightly, 10-11
p.m. EDT.
   ```Nick at Nite' is targeting the new American family. Our
demographics tell us that both kids and their parents are watching.
We're not sure who is dragging whom to the set _ the mom who loves
`Donna' and remembers it or the kid who just discovered `Mr. Ed,'
'' Nickelodeon Vice President Linda Kahn told a meeting of
television critics.
   ``We've decided we've become a Museum of Broadcasting with a
beer and a fridge thrown in for good measure,'' she said.
   Bakshi, who also appeared at the presentation to TV critics,
said his half-hour cartoon ``Tattertown'' would be an homage to the
old-style animation of the 1920s and '30s.
   The series is set in a village inhabited by cartoon characters.
   ``We'll have characters sitting in bars or in parks wondering
why didn't they make it; they could have been as big as Mickey, but
they didn't have an organization behind them,'' Bakshi said. The
concept sounds something like the wildly successful feature-length
animated film ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' which is set in 'Toon
Town.
   Bakshi said he created the concept for ``Tattertown'' back in
high school, but added, ``if it does sound like it (`Roger
Rabbit'), that's fine.'' For ``Tattertown,'' Bakshi said he will
create new characters, where ``Roger Rabbit'' featured cameos by
already famous cartoon characters.
   Bakshi didn't escape questions about his network cartoon show,
``Mighty Mouse,'' and the charge by conservative media critic Rev.
Donald Wildmon that Mighty Mouse snorted cocaine in one episode.
Bakshi said the mouse was sniffing flower petals, but later cut
those seconds from the episode to quiet the controversy.
   ``When an adult makes a statement enough times, the kids are
going to believe it, and I didn't want it to become an issues at
school _ did he or didn't he?'' said Bakshi, adding he has a
10-year-old son. He said if it had been an adult cartoon, he would
have resisted any changes, but in this case, ``my first concern was
with the kids.''
   ``Nick at Nite'' will also have its own satirical news show,
``Global Village,'' which boasts a similarly satirical promo, a
takeoff on the currently popular up-close, cinema verite
commercials. The ``Global Village'' motto is, ``If we don't cover
it, it doesn't matter.''
   As far day-time Nickelodeon, which features kids' programming,
the cable channel plans to add the new show ``Kids Court,'' in
which kids decide such issues as whether to turn in a friend for
cheating on a test, and who should have to fix a broken portable
stereo.
   There's also ``Eureka's Castle,'' a show aimed at pre-schoolers'
problems, such as being afraid of the dark or having to make a
telephone call. Kids will also get to vote in a Nickelodeon poll on
who should be president after a series of reports on the campaign
by a kid reporter. Nickelodeon announced it is developing a kids'
news show, but it will probably be a few years before it gets on
the air.
   MTV Networks, which owns Nickelodeon, also announced some
changes for its music video channel VH-1. That channel, aimed at
older viewers, is going this fall to a half-hour format rather than
radio-like continuous music. Each half hour, viewers will get an
entertainment news update, a video, a comedy short, another video,
then a ``time capsule'' look back at a moment in history before the
half hour concludes with more videos.

since it's the 40th anniversary of the awards, the show will
feature montages of shows with similar themes, such as how a
problem might have been solved in family sitcoms, dating from
``Father Knows Best'' to ``Growing Pains.'' Also as a note of
nostalgia, Michaels plans to put a band on stage _ probably
including SNL bandleader G.E. Smith _ and bring back the phrase,
``May I have the envelope please?''

<HEAD>Forecasters See Writers Strike Having Little Effect on Standings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Madison Avenue's forecasters say the writers'
strike is unlikely to have much effect on television network
standings in the fall.
   Executives of two major New York advertising agencies predict
that NBC will keep a tight grip on first place in the Nielsen
ratings.
   Betsy Frank of Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, New York's largest
agency, said ABC and CBS would be neck-and-neck for second place.
   ``It's unlikely the standings will change from our original
forecasts, even given the fact there will be cut-and-paste
schedules in the fall,'' she said by telephone from New York. ``The
pattern of network viewing is pretty hard to shake.''
   Joel M. Segal, executive vice president and director of national
broadcast for McCann-Erickson, also sees tough competition for
second place. ``NBC will remain the No. 1 network,'' he said. ``If
anything, ABC may have a leg up because of the promotion time
available in `War and Remembrance' to promote its new schedule. I
think CBS will postpone its new shows until after `War and
Remembrance' in November.''
   ABC plans to telecast the first 18 hours of Herman Wouk's ``War
and Remembrance'' miniseries in seven parts over 11 days in
mid-November. It advanced the showing because of a program shortage
caused by the writers strike.
   Both agencies published reports on the fall season as originally
planned by the networks. Although Segal was more optimistic about
the end of the strike, both executives looked for a return to work
that would enable the networks to get their new shows on by late
November or early December.
   ``I can't make any predictions about individual shows until the
strike's over,'' Segal said in a telephone interview. ``All bets
are off until then.''
   Segal had forecast in the McCann-Erickson report that despite
vigorous competition from cable, videocassettes, Fox Broadcasting
and Ted Turner's TNT the networks would lose only a small share of
their audience. He said the audience would drop to about 71 percent
this year from 72 percent in 1987.
   ``It's impossible to make any forecast at this time,'' he said,
``but I would say `War and Remembrance' and the Olympics and World
Series on NBC will tend to increase viewing. But repeats of old
shows and series that were never meant to be on the air, like NBC's
`The Hardy Boys,'' would tend to reduce viewing.''
   Frank said that the clients of her agency had already made their
network advertising purchases based on the original fall schedules.
She said the delay in starting the fall schedule could alter the
performances of individual programs forecast in her report.
   The Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton report sees ABC's ``Roseanne''
and NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear John'' as the three hottest new
shows of the fall. It also forecast a ``very good'' chance for CBS'
``Murphy Brown'' and ``Almost Grown'' and NBC's ``Unsolved
Mysteries'' and ``Tattinger's.''
   It offered little hope for such long shots as ``ABC's ``Knight
Watch'' and CBS' ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Close to Home.''
   McCann-Erickson predicted ``smash hits'' for ABC's ``Roseanne''
and NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear John.'' It gave ``passing
grades'' to CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' and NBC's ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' ``Baby Boom'' and ``Tattinger's.''
   ``Roseanne,'' from the same people who make ``The Cosby Show,''
stars comedienne Roseanne Barr as a blue collar woman juggling her
husband, kids, home and a job. ``Empty Nest,'' a spinoff of ``The
Golden Girls,'' stars Richard Mulligan as a widower with three
grown children who has now become an eligible bachelor. It also
stars David Leisure, Kristy McNichol and Dinah Manoff. Judd Hirsch
stars in ``Dear John'' as a newly divorced man who joins a singles
support group.
   McCann-Erickson said ABC's ``Knight Watch'' and ``Murphy's
Law,'' CBS's ``Almost Grown,'' ``TV 101,'' ``Paradise,'' ``Dirty
Dancing,'' ``Close to Home'' and the new comedies starting Dick Van
Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore were likely failures.

   For many retired Americans, the temptations are
growing stronger to venture back into the labor force.
   The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 14 years, and
new young workers are scarce because of the low birth rates that
prevailed in this country in the 1960s and early 1970s.
   Students of population trends say the situation will almost
certainly grow more acute over the next few years.
   Retail stores, restaurant chains, supermarkets and many other
types of businesses are looking to the retired as one source of
help for their labor-shortage problem.
   What's more, even in an era where reported inflation is
relatively low, many retirees may find that they want or need some
extra income.
   The match seems perfect. However, says a leading advisory firm
on business and financial affairs, retirees are well advised to do
some reckoning before they go out in quest of a new paycheck.
   ``Social Security beneficiaries who want to rejoin the work
force should calculate carefully before making the move,'' says
United & Babson Investment Report, published in Boston.
   As the firm points out, Social Security recipients under age 70
who earn money from a job lose $1 in benefits for every $2 of wages
they receive above specified limits.
   At the same time, they must pay income taxes and Social Security
taxes on their earnings from the job.
   ``A working beneficiary could conceivably lose 65 percent or
more of his or her added income,'' United & Babson says.
   Of course, the decision to work or not to work in a person's
later years may be influenced by emotional factors as well as
financial ones.
   When a leading graduate business school asked recently at what
age the members of a reunion class would like to retire, a very
large percentage of those who filled out the questionnaire checked
``never.''
   Still, it is a sensible idea to figure out beforehand whether
taking a job in your retirement years is going to make you enough
take-home money to justify the effort.
   This year, Social Security recipients between ages 65 and 70
begin to lose benefits after their wage and salary earnings exceed
$8,400. For those under 65, the cutoff point is $6,120
   ``If a retiree goes back to work at a salary significantly above
the limit, he should request that benefits be suspended,'' United &
Babson's analysts advise.
   That goes especially for workers 65 to 70 years old, they add,
since passing up current benefits will increase the Social Security
payments they are eligible to receive later on.
   All this raises the question of whether the limits on
recipients' earnings serve a useful purpose.
   Says United & Babson: ``In the 1930s, when the Social Security
system originated, the earnings test (limit) was included as a way
of encouraging older workers to leave the work force to free jobs
for younger people.
   ``In recent years the age distribution of the population has
shifted dramatically. Today fewer young workers are entering the
work force, and labor shortages are a problem in many cities.
   ``Although 20 or so bills seeking the elimination of earnings
limits have been filed in Congress, this legislation is not
considered a high-priority item.''

   The drought of '88 is a test of nerve and
confidence for farmers across the American heartland. This report,
third in an occasional series on the Chases of Barry County, Mich.,
examines the emotional strain on one family determined to keep
their dream alive.

   From Kurt and Dena Chase's back porch,
fields of corn stretch away toward the horizon, a healthy-looking
green. But the stalks have no ears. The rains came too late in
Barry County.
   Day by day, as they endure the worst drought of their lifetime,
the young farm couple try not to dwell on their worries, especially
in front of their two small children.
   But 4-year-old Jesse knows something is wrong.
   ``There's not a prayer Jesse says that he doesn't ask for
rain,'' Dena says sadly, but with a mother's proud smile. ``He
says, `If there's anything up there, Jesus, let it pour!' ''
   And some rain has come.
   When a pair of storms roared through in mid-July and dumped 2
inches of rain _ more than farmers here had seen in several months
_ the cornstalks shot up a foot in four days.
   The rain boosted morale. But the Chases know it did not arrive
soon enough for most of the 350 acres of corn they farm with Kurt's
parents, Gordon and Jean Chase. Had the skies opened up two weeks
earlier, it might have done some good.
   The two generations of Chases, who live less than a mile apart
off a gravel road, will see underdeveloped ears on most plants and
none at all on others. Some stalks never made it out of the ground.
   The soybeans and hay now have a chance at survival _ but only if
the rain continues. The helplessness the family feels has taken its
toll.
   ``I've never really thought about doing anything else but
farming,'' says Kurt, 28, as he relaxes on the living-room couch,
Jesse and 2{-year-old Abby wrestling at his feet.
   ``But a year like this one kind of makes you wonder.''
   Kurt has been helping his father on the farm ever since he can
remember. Now he is a partner.
   His 30-year-old sister, Kim, lives with her husband and two
young children, and his 26-year-old brother, Kyle, works for an
insurance company. They both live within an hour's drive of the
farm and come over often to help out.
   ``For me, it just felt right to stay in farming,'' Kurt says.
   But he has felt the temptation to trade in 90-hour weeks of
endless chores for a 40-hour week at a factory and more time with
his family. It's a temptation he resists.
   Some days he doesn't get to see his daughter at all. She's
sleeping when he leaves at 4:30 a.m. to milk the cows, and she's
been tucked in for the night by the time he gets home at 9:30 p.m.
Sometimes, Kurt must ``baby-sit'' the irrigation system through the
night to make sure nothing goes wrong and no water is wasted.
   ``I probably spend more time with my father than with Dena,''
says Kurt, who has his father's thick blond hair, fair skin and
football player's physique.
   He and Dena, a pretty brunette, met in high school and were
married eight years ago. They are expecting their third child in
January.
   Their 115-year-old, five-bedroom farmhouse needs paint, and the
rickety stairs out back need fixing. But inside, bunches of dried
flowers hang from the ceiling, and art and ornaments grace the
walls. The same attention to detail can be seen in Gordon and
Jean's home, right down to the flagpole and Old Glory outside.
   Kurt and Dena find time together when they can.
   Dena, 27, sometimes packs lunches and takes the children out to
where Kurt is working in the fields, and they share a picnic.
During spring planting, the children spent long hours with their
parents in the cab of a tractor.
   Neither Kurt nor his father can find the words to explain fully
the sense of pride they feel in owning and cultivating land. But
the pride seems to more than make up for the stress that, even in
good times, accompanies it.
   Kurt beams as he watches Jesse play with a miniature John Deere
tractor in his sandbox.
   ``He does everything his dad does,'' Dena says.
   The farming operation is based at Jean and Gordon's home. As
cows graze outside, a computer terminal inside shows the changing
prices corn, soybeans and other commodities on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   ``There's a lot of stress involved when your business is based
at home,'' Jean says. ``It seems salesmen always pull in when
you're halfway through your meal. ... That's probably why vacations
are so important to us.''
   It's also probably why Gordon and Jean plan to build a home
nearby, ``but not on this road,'' when they're ready to retire.
That's when Kurt and Dena will move into their house.
   Gordon and Jean believe their son and daughter-in-law will build
a better, but not necessarily bigger farm when they take over.
   ``We see something different in their generation _ they have
different priorities,'' Jean says. ``Maybe seeing our parents come
through the Depression, we thought bigger was better. But they
don't _ maybe after witnessing all the hard times we've had.''
   This year will surely stick in their memories.
   The drought's final impact will not be known until the harvest
is finished in late fall. Much still depends on whether the rain
continues.
   ``All we can do,'' says Jean, ``is wait and hope.''

   Finding a reliable auto mechanic, a big
problem for many people while at home, can be even more taxing
while traveling.
   While honest service stations can be found, the American
Automobile Association warns that there are some unscrupulous shops
that overcharge for repairs and recommend unnecessary work,
especially when dealing with motorists from another state, warns
the American Automobile Association.
   Officials of the Government Employees Insurance Co. urge having
the car checked out by a local mechanic before embarking on a
vacation or other trip, just to head off any developing problems.
   In particular, have the mechanic check the cooling system,
brakes, fan and power belts and tires, since these are the most
common items that break down.
   Make sure the spare tire is fully inflated too, and have the
mechanic check for proper wheel alignment and balance.
   Both Geico and AAA remind motorists to stay with their cars
while stopping at unfamiliar service stations. If someone needs to
use the bathroom or walk the dog, take turns, they advise.
   Check your water and oil levels each morning before starting
out, as well as the tire pressure.
   Properly inflated tires can prevent accidents, increase tread
life and stretch out gas mileage, reports the Tire Industry Safety
Council.
   The AAA advises motorists to be suspicious of any attendant who
seems to go out of his way to inspect the car while pumping gas.
   Geico warns that occasionally an attendant will create a problem
by cutting a fan belt or splashing some oil on the shock absorbers
to make it appear there is a leak.
   To avoid problems:
   If the car does break down, get a written estimate explaining
exactly what is to be done before any work starts, and get a signed
receipt for the work.
   If the car is not disabled, consider getting a second opinion on
the problem and the cost of repairs.
   Make certain any old parts are actually replaced, not merely
cleaned and put back in the car. Ask for the removed items, take
them home with you and have a mechanic inspect them to see if they
really needed to be replaced.
   If a repair shop refuses to provide a written estimate or to
return replaced parts, have the work done somewhere else, even if
the car has to be towed, AAA says.
   Check with a local AAA office for recommendations. Local Better
Business Bureaus and consumer affairs offices can help with
warnings about shops that have generated many complaints.

   David Strode is so single-minded about his
religious beliefs that he welcomes ridicule and willingly risks
physical abuse to preach the Gospel where and whenever he sees the
need, whether it's in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant or
on a crowded city street.
   He even has a mini-sermon on his telephone answering machine.
   ``The Bible says repent ye, therefore, and be converted that
your sins be blotted out,'' begins the taped message to those who
phone his rented home in this western North Carolina mountain town.
   Strode, 40, is a dark-haired, powerfully built man, a skilled
machinist and a non-stop talker.
   For the past three months, he has been mostly talking about the
controversy which erupted last spring when his sons began preaching
on their elementary school playground, calling their teachers and
classmates ``whoremongers'' and ``fornicators,'' among other things.
   Strode says he sees his actions, and those of his children, as
the living testimony and witness of ``totally saved Christians.''
   Others in the community see the Strodes as the most frustrating
and infuriating people they've ever encountered.
   They describe the father as a know-it-all zealot who likes to
spout scripture and loves the attention his actions, and those of
his children, bring to the family.
   ``The media has made a big deal out of the Strodes and it has
gone to their heads,'' asserts Doug Moyers, an area resident.
   Lisa Mahan ruefully recalls the day last spring at Eastfield
Elementary School, when she attempted to present Strode with a
parents' petition. It asked Strode to restrain his sons, Duffy, 11,
and Matthew, 5, who were attracting hordes of reporters with their
preaching and screeching on the school grounds.
   ``He simply wouldn't listen,'' said Mrs. Mahan, who has a child
at the school. ``We only wanted him to control his children and
have them quit disrupting the school, but he just laughed and
called me a `Jezebel' and a lot worse.''
   She paused, then added, ``I'll tell you one thing: nobody wants
anything to do with him anymore, or those kids either.''
   Mike Jones, managing editor of The McDowell News, Marion's daily
newspaper, says the Strodes have upset practically everyone in the
community.
   ``It's not the fact that the Strodes preach that upsets
people,'' he added. ``It's where they do it and how they do it and
what they call people. For example, the teachers really got upset
after the boys started calling them whores and fornicators, as you
might imagine.''
   The Strodes appear to have little or no support even among
fundamentalist Christians locally, he said.
   Strode himself, who swears by the King James version of the
Bible and calls everything else ``trash,'' readily acknowledges
that he has become a pariah among Marion's 3,000 residents.
   ``A guy came at me with a crowbar the other night, while me and
another preacher was preaching from the back of a pickup truck down
at the Pizza Hut parking lot,'' he said. ``They're trying to run us
out of town.
   ``I was laid off from my job in May. The bosses at the plant
deny it, but I know it was because of my preaching. Now, nobody
will give me a job, even though I have 20 years of experience and
there's a need for machinists in this area.''
   He also says the Rev. Danny Castle, pastor of Marion's New Manna
Baptist Church, where his family has attended for the past 18
months, recently asked him not to come back.
   ``He said we were hurting the church,'' Strode said. ``Can you
believe that? Here I am living a good Christian life and preaching
the Gospel and they ask me and my kids not to come back.''
   Castle has said publicly that his congregation is taking flak
because of the Strodes' actions. Bruce Ward, the assistant pastor,
said Strode repeatedly refused requests to tone down his preaching
style, especially his tendency to call passersby names.
   ``David Strode is a very tough case,'' Ward said. ``It's a real
shame about those kids but I feel the church not only went the
extra mile with Strode, but three extra miles; it's just that he
seems to think differently from most other people.''
   Strode, who has been on several television and radio talk shows
in recent weeks, says he is beginning to believe Marion is a
``bad'' community.
   ``The world is a wicked place,'' he said as he sat in his living
room. ``It's plain to see. The same thing happened to us up in
Pennsylvania, before we came down here.''
   Robin Strode, his 27-year-old wife and mother of Duffy, Matthew
and daughter Pepper, says she fully supports the preachings of her
husband and sons.
   She also says her husband and sons, who literally scream when
they preach, are loving and soft-spoken at home.
   ``It's just that they have to change, sort of fill themselves
with anger, when they're preaching,'' she said. ``It's like they
have to hate the world to be able to see the wickedness that's
everywhere around us.''
   Mrs. Strode says her children get their religious convictions
and preaching style from their father, who was ``saved'' eight
years ago while watching television back home in St. Thomas, Pa., a
hamlet near Chambersburg.
   Recalling the incident, she said, ``It was late one night and he
was turning the dial, looking for something to watch. He found what
he thought was a horror show but it turned out to be the Rev. Jack
VanImpe, an evangelist from Royal Oak, Mich., who's known as the
`living Bible' because he can recite the entire New Testament.
   ``After hearing VanImpe, my husband got a Bible and began
reading it day and night. In about two weeks he was totally saved.''

   Mrs. Strode, who said she met her husband in a Chambersburg
barroom when she was 15 and married him a year later, acknowledges
she resisted the Lord for years after her husband and children were
converted.
   ``I even left one time, for 18 months, because I couldn't take
the constant preaching anymore,'' she said.
   ``During that time I lived like a whore, with seven or eight
different men. I was trying to see what the world had to offer but
I realized it didn't have anything for me, and I came back to my
family. A few months after that I was saved.''
   The family moved from Pennsylvania to North Carolina in January
1987.
   ``Everything we had was piled up on top of a flatbed truck,''
she said. ``We looked like ol' Jed Clampett of the Beverly
Hillbillies when we hit town.''
   Strode and his wife are natives of the Chambersburg area, just
north of the Maryland line.
   ``Robin quit school in the 12th grade because she was pregnant
with our second child, but I'm a high school graduate,'' he said.
   He said he went to high school in Gettysburg, living in a
children's home after his mother's death when he was 14. He spent
two years in the Army in West Germany and served a four-year
machinist's apprenticeship, he said.
   ``I used to be a drunken fornicator, but I always worked and
made good money.''
   Strode says he came to Marion after hearing a taped sermon by
Danny Castle.
   ``Things weren't going so good in Pennsylvania for us and I
really liked Danny Castle's preaching,'' he said. ``But now I'm not
so sure that he's really, truly saved.''
   In Pennsylvania, Strode was twice arrested while preaching,
charged with disturbing the peace, and he in turn accused
Chambersburg officials in a suit of violating his First Amendment
rights. The charges and the suit were eventually dropped, with the
city agreeing to pay his lawyer's fees.
   Will there be more trouble when public school starts up again,
on Aug. 22?
   ``We may send the kids to school or we may try and teach them at
home, if we can get together the money for the books and so
forth,'' he said.
   Asked what their response will be should the Strode children
resume their preaching on school grounds this fall, McDowell County
school officials would say only that they intend to enforce school
regulations to the letter.
   Those rules say children must go directly into the school when
they arrive. The Strode boys refused to go inside immediately,
instead preaching outside until the bell rang.
   ``Frankly, I'm afraid they might suspend my kids, like they did
last spring, and then try to take them away from me,'' Strode says.
``I love my kids and that's something I could never allow to happen.
   ``Who knows? We're in the process of building a house. Maybe
we'll just sell it and move away. Somebody probably would buy it in
a minute, just to get rid of us.''
   If the Strodes do leave Marion, the mayor of Chambersburg,
Robert Morris, he hopes they don't return to his community.
   ``Strode's a terribly disrupitve influence,'' Morris said in a
telephone interview. ``He used to go up and down our main street,
screaming at the top of his voice, calling people whores and
whoremongers and so forth.
   ``It's much quieter here since the Strodes left the area and,
frankly, we hope they never return.''

   Consumer spending increased in June at the
fastest pace in 10 months, the government said, fueling concern
over inflation and whether the economy will have room for
production of exports.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that personal consumption
spending shot up a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent in June, the
steepest climb since a 1.3 percent gain last August.
   The report was a disappointment to many economists who are
looking for growth in consumer demand to slow in order to narrow
the nation's trade deficit.

   The price of imported goods, one of the main
inflationary yardsticks in the U.S. economy, rose 2.7 percent in
the April-June quarter, the largest increase in more than a year,
the government reported.
   The Labor Department said Thursday that the second-quarter rise
followed a 1.2 percent increase in the January-March period and was
the steepest since the 4.1 percent jump in the first three months
of 1987.

   The most comprehensive banking bill since the
Great Depression cleared a House committee after 16{ grueling hours
of debate, but it faces an uncertain future with little time left
in Congress' legislative year.
   The bill, approved Thursday by the House Banking Committee,
grants banks broad new securities powers but restricts their
ability to enter real estate and insurance and imposes new
obligations on them to serve the poor.
   The bill now is headed for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, where the chairman, Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., is
known to be skeptical of letting banks into the securities business.

   Congress overwhelmingly approved some $6 billion in aid for
drought-stricken farmers after scaling back provisions for special
assistance to milk producers and ethanol fuel makers.
   Also Thursday, the Reagan administration projected the federal
deficit for the upcoming budget year at $140.1 billion _ short of
the trigger for across-the-board spending cuts _ but warned that a
hefty drought-relief bill could cause the automatic reductions to
kick in.

   The nation's No. 3 automaker said Thursday its earnings fell to
$320.4 million, or $1.45 a share, from $424.1 million, or $1.98 a
share, in the second quarter of 1987.

   A plan to resurrect MGM and United

Kerkorian and Burt Sugarman announced they couldn't agree on
details of the $400 million deal.
   Extensive talks failed to produce a definitive agreement, MGM-UA

   The investors had reported just two weeks earlier an agreement

<HEAD>Giant Drugstore Chain Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOROTHY GAST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Revco D.S. Inc.'s inability to pay the
huge debt incurred in its 1986 leveraged buyout has forced the
giant drugstore chain into federal bankruptcy protection, and
illustrated the potential risks to companies and investors involved
in such transactions.
   Revco D.S. Inc., which operates 2,000 U.S. drugstores in the
Midwest, Southeast and Southwest, filed for protection from
creditors Thursday, just over a month after failing to make a $46
million interest payment to holders of bonds issued to finance the
$1.5 billion buyout, the largest ever to fail.
   Boake A. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer, told a
news conference that holders of $400 million in junk bonds
accelerated the payment schedule after Revco missed the interest
payment June 15.
   Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk notes commonly issued to
fund leveraged buyouts and other types of corporate takeovers.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with
borrowed funds that are repaid with the company's cash flow or sale
of its assets.
   Revco's buyout foundered as increased competition and sluggish
cash flow crippled the company's ability to cover its obligations.
   Against a tide of new discount operations and supermarkets
adding pharmacies, Revco tried to slash prices and move beyond
drugs to big-ticket items like small appliances. Lately, as those
efforts faltered, it refocused on its core drugstore business.
   Revco, which has annual sales of $2.3 billion, fills more than
65 million prescriptions a year.
   ``Revco's leveraged buyout didn't work out, and hundreds more
have,'' Sells said. ``Junk bonds have been the best investment on
Wall Street...but if you'd only invested in one junk bond you'd be
pretty unhappy if it was Revco.''
   D.S. Partners of New York owns controlling interest in Revco,
Sells said. When the drugstore chain missed its June 15 interest
payment, bondholders established a steering committee that
contacted the company.
   Proposed talks over having Revco turn over stock to satisfy the
debt broke down before they even started, Sells said.
   Revco has been ``husbanding'' cash the past few days to meet its
payroll and to pay venders who sell to the company after Thursday's
Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron.
   Revco's two largest venders reacted well to news of the
bankruptcy filing, Sells said. He said the reorganization might
disrupt shipments from a vender or two, but he does not expect much
change in day-to-day operations.
   The company does not play to lay off any of its 28,000 employees
because of Chapter 11 and has received court permission to continue
payments of salary and benefits, Sells said.
   The Chapter 11 filing includes Revco; its parent company, ANAC
Holding Co., and most of its subsidiary operations. Insta-Care
Pharmacy Services is not included, the company said.
   The filing allows Revco to obtain new credit and invoices for
goods and services, and requires the company to submit to
bankruptcy court a reorganization plan restructuring the company's
debt.

<HEAD>City Capital Bids $2.46 Billion For Interco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI DODGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A partnership bidding $2.46 billion to acquire
Interco Inc. may have to raise its offer to satisfy shareholders,
some industry analysts say.
   Interco said Thursday that its board would meet Aug. 8 to
consider the $64 a share bid made by City Capital Associates, a
Washington, D.C.-based limited partnership.
   Wall Street indicated it believed bids for the apparel and home
furnishings manufacturing and retailing company. Interco stock
soared $13.37{ a share to close at $67.75 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Thursday.
   Interco's best known brand names include London Fog clothes,
Florsheim and Converse shoes and Broyhill and Ethan Allen furniture.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, City
Capital said it already owned 8.7 percent, or 3.14 million, of
Interco's 38.4 million outstanding shares.
   City Capital listed its principals as Steven M. Rales and
Mitchell P. Rales. They are respectively the chairman and president
of Danaher Corp., a Washington-based manufacturer of automotive and
industrial products and vinyl building materials.
   Ned Armstrong, a securities analyst in the Washington, D.C.,
office of Johnston, Lemon, expressed confidence in the Raleses
ability to attract financial backing for what looks to be a
highly-leveraged bid for Interco.
   City Capital said it did not have financing commitments for the
proposed buyout, but said it was confident of being able to arrange
them.
   The partnership said that if it succeeded in acquiring Interco,
it planned to sell the apparel business and was considering the
sale of parts of its general retail merchandising and footwear
manufacturing and retailing businesses.
   But City Capital left open the possibility that it might reach
``a different conclusion as to which of (Interco's) assets might be
retained or sold'' after a review of the company's assets,
operations and policies.
   In a letter to the Interco board, City Capital also said it
might increase its offer based on a further review of information
about the target company.
   Robert F. Buchanan, a retail industry analyst with the
investment firm A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said he
believed Interco was worth more than the City Capital offer.
   ``I think a fair value is somewhere around $67,'' he said.
   Buchanan, who said Interco's footwear and furniture segments
were its most valuable divisions, said the company likely would
want to remain independent.
   Laurence C. Day, an analyst with Newhard, Cook and Co. Inc.,
agreed, saying he would be surprised if Interco was receptive to
the offer, even if City Capital offered to keep Interco management
intact.
   Day said recent actions by Interco were defensive moves designed
to boost the price of its stock and make a takeover attempt more
expensive.
   The company announced earlier this month it was considering
selling its apparel manufacturing group as part of a restructuring
that began in 1985.
   ``I think it's a real question whether Interco is interested,''
Day said. ``I would doubt it.''
   In addition to its manufacturing operations, Interco operates
201 retail locations in 15 states, including home-improvement
centers, general merchandise discount stores, men's specialty
apparel shops and specialty department stores.
   Interco had sales of $3.34 billion last year, with the apparel
group contributing about 24 percent.
   Buchanan said Interco's performance ``hasn't done as well as it
could in recent years'' and its stock price had languished.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major currencies in
modest trading today but traders predicted fear of central bank
intervention would limit the currency's upswing.
   Gold prices fell slightly.
   Foreign exchange dealers said end-of-the-month commercial
requirements and technical short-covering nudged the U.S. currency
up in early trading.
   The dealers said dollar demand stemmed largely from corporate
customers who needed to cover their commercial obligations before
the end of the month. Some market operators were covering
short-dollar positions, or buying dollars to fulfill agreements to
sell them, ahead of the weekend as well, they said.
   Italian traders, however, predicted the market would not see a
significant rise in the dollars this session because fear of
central bank intervention inspired some caution.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7170, compared
with $1.7225 Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8764 West German marks, up from 1.8645; 1.5615
Swiss francs, up from 1.5505; 6.3280 French francs, up from 6.2885;
2.1088 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0920; 1,386.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,370.50; 1.2100 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2086.
   In Tokyo, whose business day ends before Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.43 yen to close at 132.53. Later, in London, it was
quoted at 131.92 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $432.10 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $433. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $432.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $432.25, down from $432.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid price of $434.48, up
from Thursday's closing bid price of $433.78.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.82 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $6.79.

   The dollar dipped slightly in afternoon trading in
Tokyo today but closed higher at 132.53 yen, while stocks continued
to rise.
   The dollar, which opened trading at 132.60 yen, finished 0.43
yen higher than Thursday's close of 132.10 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 57.52-point
winner Thursday, gained another 115.54 points, or 0.42 percent, to
finish the day's trading at 27,911.63.
   After opening slightly above the 28,000 mark, the most widely
followed barometer on the exchange remained higher than 28,000
through most of the morning session, but edged down in afternoon
dealings.
   It was the first time the index exceeded 28,000 points since
July 15. The Nikkei has fluctuated at the mid- and low-27,000 level
over the past two weeks.
   The market was helped in part by an overnight gain in New York,
traders said.
   Financials such as banks closed higher, led by Sumitomo, Fuji
and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Banks.
   Also among gainers were heavy industrials such as
Ishikawajima-Harima, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsui
Engineering and Shipbuilding.
   Electricals fell back after early gains as some investors took
profits.
   ``It has been an established pattern that if market opens
higher, it declines because of profit-taking,'' said a broker at a
major securities firm who would not be quoted by name. ``But the
environment is good and the dollar seems stable for some time.''
   Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's strength to
reduced concern about growing inflation in the United States. In
New York overnight, the U.S. currency rose 1.05 yen to close at
132.60 yen.

   Here are details of the drought-relief bills
passed by the House and Senate:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHO'S ELIGIBLE?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Producers of any commercial crop would be eligible for disaster
payments under drought-relief legislation passed by both chambers,
if they lost more than 35 percent of their 1988 harvest due to
drought.
   _Producers of crops covered by federal farm programs and those
that are not would be equally eligible for the payments, which
would equal 65 percent of their losses over the 35 percent
threshold.
   _Under the House version, farmers also would be eligible if the
damage were caused by hail, floods or other natural disasters.

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Growers whose crops were severely damaged would be eligible for
supplemental payments. Under the House bill, this would amount to
an additional 30 percent of losses over 75 percent of expected
harvest. The Senate version would cover an additional 20 percent of
losses over 75 percent.

   _A special program would reimburse up to 50 percent of the cost
of replacement feed purchased during the emergency, allow sale of
government-owned feed at reduced rates, donate government feed to
producers unable to purchase it, pay up to 50 percent of some feed
transportation costs and provide up to half the cost of deepening
wells and certain other steps needed to water livestock.
   Livestock producers already eligible for existing government
feed programs and those in areas where USDA determines a feed
emergency exists would be eligible.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Look for Quick Delivery of Drought Bill to Reagan</HEAD>

   Lawmakers are promising to iron out House and
Senate differences over a $6 billion drought-relief package in a
quick flurry of action next week and speed the measure on to
President Reagan's desk.
   ``My opinion is that the president would accept this bill as it
is passed today, although there have been some things he objects
to,'' Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., said Thursday after 94-0
Senate passage of the bill.
   The House had approved its version 368-29 a few hours earlier
after scaling back a plan to increase milk price supports, a
proposal widely criticized as excessively favoring the dairy
industry.
   The revised version would impose a temporary increase for three
months next year. Milk price supports previously had been scheduled
to decrease on Jan. 1.
   Senators tightened up a similarly controversial benefit in their
bill that would allow companies that make ethanol for fuel to buy
corn from government surplus bins at what could shape up as a
substantial discount.
   However, there were still warnings that Congress was flirting
with budget trouble by inserting special benefits for constituents
back home into the measure.
   The House, urged by Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika''
de la Garza, D-Texas, acted to cap the price tag of its bill at
$5.8 billion.
   The Senate had no comparably firm figure. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, said latest estimates put the cost of the Senate measure
at between $5.85 billion and $6.55 billion.
   Gramm warned that running over a $5.8 billion ceiling calculated
under the Gramm-Rudman budget law would set off nasty fiscal and
political repercussions.
   At the heart of the bill are provisions that would provide
disaster payments to farmers equal to 65 percent of losses beyond
35 percent of expected harvest. Many dairy and livestock producers
would become eligible for benefits under an expanded government
feed aid program.
   Farmers especially hard hit by the drought would get
supplemental payments under both House and Senate bills.
   A number of other points remain to be resolved when lawmakers
meet in a House-Senate conference committee next week. The House
version requires farmers to buy federal crop insurance for each of
the next two years if they are to be eligible for disaster payments
this year.
   The Senate version does not contain such a provision, which is
opposed by both the Reagan administration and a wide array of major
crop producer groups.
   Both bills would cancel a 50-cent cut in the milk price-support
level scheduled for Jan. 1 but the House version would go beyond
that. The House provision would raise the price-support level from
April through June 1989 by 50 cents, to $11.10 cents for each 100
pounds of milk.
   Dairy-state lawmakers wanted even more, pushing for a permanent
increase.
   ``This is a most dangerous and wrongheaded precedent,'' Rep. Pat
Roberts, R-Kan., said in opposing the measure. He said it was
unfair to provide such aid to dairymen and not also to cattle,
sheep and poultry producers, who must pay the same increased feed
costs.
   The House, however, voted 217-181 for the temporary increase, a
compromise sponsored by Reps. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., and Tim
Penny, D-Minn.
   House conferees are going to be looking hard at a Senate
provision that would allow the nation's ethanol makers to purchase
surplus grain from government bins at 110 percent of the
Agriculture Department's acquisition cost. Much of the government
corn was acquired long before the drought pushed up prices.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., sponsored the measure, but offered a
compromise amendment to end the program in September 1989 and cap
the amount of corn that could be used at 16 million bushels.
   By Daschle's calcuation the price break for ethanol makers would
be about 10 cents a bushel, although that includes transportation
costs and other factors. He said the measure is aimed at helping
small ethanol producers, but it also would be a boon to the Archer
Daniels Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill., which produces the lion's
share of U.S. ethanol.
   House debate began with Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa., complaining that
a temperature control project to encourage salmon spawning in the
Sacramento River near Shasta dam had been placed in the bill. He
demanded to know who ``wants this pork garbage in the bill.''
   De la Garza said that the project, a favorite of Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., was intended to assure consumers an adequate
supply of food.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,
told reporters later that he had tried to keep so-called pork
barrel projects out of the Senate bill ``but some wends its way
through despite the tightest security.''

   The Reagan administration says the federal
deficit will be $5.6 billion higher than it predicted back in
February, with the government's red ink now estimated to total
$152.3 billion this fiscal year.
   While the new administration estimate announced Thursday is
higher, it is still below the more gloomy projections earlier this
year by many private economists, who were forecasting a deficit of
$160 billion or worse.
   Those economists have been busy revising their own figures, and
some now say the administration's new deficit forecast for the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30 may actually be too pessimistic.
   As the year began, the administration predicted the overall
economy as measured by the gross national product would expand at a
sluggish 2.4 percent rate. The new budget has boosted that GNP
estimate to 3 percent.
   The higher growth this year has helped push the unemployment
rate down to a 14-year-low of 5.3 percent. More people working
means more tax revenues for Uncle Sam.
   Tax revenues are expected to be $4.2 billion higher than the
administration's February projection, according to the new report.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he is
now predicting the 1988 deficit will total $145 billion based on
the gains in tax revenues which have already occurred.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said he is
forecasting a deficit this year of $151 billion, slightly lower
than the administration's estimate.
   The administration is calling for the deficit in the next fiscal
year to decline to $140.1 billion, an estimate that private
economists say is generally in line with their own forecasts.
   That deficit estimate is $5.9 billion below the $146 billion
level which would trigger automatic spending cuts as required by
the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   However, White House budget director James Miller warned that
the $5.9 billion cushion did not leave much room for error,
especially given a lengthy list of spending measures Congress is
considering in an election year.
   The measure with the highest price tag is a drought-relief
package for farmers, which Miller estimated would cost the
government between $4.3 billion and $6.6 billion.
   Miller said President Reagan supports drought relief but is
opposed to using ``the plight of the farmers as an opportunity to
make a Christmas tree out of that bill'' by loading it up with
other farm assistance that has little to do with drought relief.
   Miller also listed as potential budget-busters measures to step
up the battle against illegal drugs and provide more aid the hungry
and homeless.
   He said if all the proposals were enacted by Congress, it would
increase spending between $6.4 billion and $8.7 billion, enough
even at the low end of the estimate to trigger the automatic
spending cuts.
   ``We can't do all the things that Congress has on its list right
now,'' Miller told reporters at a White House briefing.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., agreed
that the administration's mid-session review points up the need for
lawmakers to make tough choices in coming weeks.
   ``All of the urgent needs of the nation cannot be funded at the
levels most of us would support in less difficult times,'' Gray
said.
   Evans said he doubted that Congress would risk triggering the
across-the-board spending cuts, especially since they would take
effect only weeks before the November election.
   ``I think Miller is trying to hold people's feet to the fire so
Congress doesn't go crazy with the drought bill, but it would snow
in July before Congress would allow across-the-board spending cuts
to go into effect,'' Evans said.
   Evans said that last year, when Congress faced similar budget
problems, it found a way to keep within the deficit targets by
pushing $5 billion in spending from September to October, the start
of a new fiscal year. He said if necessary, lawmakers would resort
to similar budgetary tricks this year to escape mandatory spending
cuts.
   The administration's mid-session budget review projected that
the budget deficit would decline steadily in coming years.
   It forecast a 1990 deficit, if Congress accepts its proposals on
further spending cuts, of $102.3 billion, declining to $85.4
billion in 1991, $64.9 billion in 1992 and $34.2 billion in 1993,

<HEAD>Takeshita Calls on Parliament to Reform Tax System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told Japan's
legislators Friday that tax reform is the most important domestic
issue facing the nation, and urged them to approve the first major
overhaul of the tax system since it was set up by U.S. occupation
forces in 1950.
   In a speech before the Japanese parliament, the Diet, Takeshita
delivered a strong appeal for passage of a tax reform package he
has pinpointed as a top item on his political agenda.
   ``There is an urgent need to rectify (distortions of the present
tax system) to institute a new tax system that is fair, simple and
acceptable to the people,'' he said.
   Tax reform has been long awaited by the average Japanese
salary-earner who bears a heavy direct tax burden, compared to
self-employed individuals and other categories of taxpayers who are
eligible for substantial tax breaks.
   Takeshita said that if his package is approved taxpayers will
win an unprecedented amount in tax cuts totaling 5.6 trillion yen,
the equivalent of $43 billion, for fiscal 1988 ending next March.
   But a shadow already looms over the tax reform plan.
   Opposition parties refused to open Diet proceedings until the
prime minister's ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed to
substantial tax cuts. They are also demanding the government scrap
plans to introduce an indirect consumption tax of 3 percent on
goods and services next April.
   Takeshita indicated he was prepared to compromise: ``It is
important that the tax burden be passed along smoothly and justly,
and the administration will work to create the right environment
for this.''
   Earlier Friday, the Cabinet approved six tax bills making up
Takeshita's reform package due for debate in the Diet in upcoming
weeks.
   The new plan calls for reducing the 12 brackets in the
progressive income tax system, with rates ranging from 10.5 percent
to 60 percent, to five brackets ranging from 10 to 50 percent.
Residential taxes would also be reduced and corporate taxes would
drop from 42 percent to 37.5 percent.
   Eight categories of goods and services have been earmarked as
non-taxable, including medical care, education costs and capital
gains from land transactions.
   The 70-day extraordinary Diet session opened Tuesday after a
one-week delay and after an agreement by the ruling party to
investigate two recent developments: the role of a government
submarine in a marine disaster last Saturday and the recent
disclosure of unethical stock deals that reaped massive profits for
government officials, including a Takeshita aide.
   Takeshita opened his speech with an apology over the collision
between a military submarine and a leisure vessel that claimed 30
civilian lives.
   He also alluded to the legal but shady stock purchases in which
selected individuals were offered shares of the Recruit-Cosmos Co.,
a real estate firm, prior to their release for over-the-counter
dealings.
   ``We must always be mindful of political ethics and
self-discipline in government service ... and it is imperative that
we continually fulfill our responsibilities without even a hint of
impropriety,'' Takeshita said.
   The scandal involves more than a dozen prominent political and
business leaders suspected of earning huge profits by obtaining the
unlisted shares and then selling them after they were released on
the market.
   To date, Takeshita, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and
former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe have admitted their aides at
the time earned profits.
   In Japan, however, it generally known that aides act on behalf
of the politicians they serve.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Rises From Previous Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan posted a current account surplus of $6.43
billion in June, up 11 percent from the previous month but down 14
percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced Friday.
   In May, Japan's current account surplus totaled $5.79 billion,
while in June 1987 it registered $7.5 billion.
   The current account is the broadest measure of a country's
commerce, measuring trade in goods and services as well as other
capital flows.
   Ministry officials said imports continued to rise sharply during
the month. But they said exports also increased, continuing the
double-digit rise that began last November despite the higher value
of the Japanese yen.
   The officials said demand remained strong for Japanese products
in other countries, including the United States.
   ``The U.S. economy has been doing very well and that is one of
the major reasons for this increase, despite the yen's
appreciation,'' one official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A higher yen makes Japanese products more expensive and
therefore less competitive overseas.
   The officials said demand remained especially high for Japanese
items such as automobiles, steel, semiconductors and business
machines.
   Japanese imports have been growing because of strong domestic
demand resulting from Japan's current economic expansion and
because of the higher yen, which tends to reduce the cost of
foreign products.
   Growth of imports of non-ferrous metals, lumber and steel was
particularly strong during the month, the officials said.
   Record numbers of Japanese tourists traveling overseas, taking
advantage of the yen's appreciation, helped reduce the current
account surplus, the officials said.
   The portion of the current account measuring flows of money
related to tourism, shipping, insurance, banking and commodity
services showed a record deficit of $737 million during the month,
they said. In May, the figure was $612 million, and in June 1987 it
was $251 million.

<HEAD>Subroto Expects Oil Prices Rise Over Coming Weeks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto, one name, is correct.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC Secretary-General
Subroto said he expects the price of oil to rise in coming weeks
because of the possibility of an end to the Persian Gulf war,
according to a report published Friday.
   Statements by Subroto, who heads the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, were published in the United Arab
Emirates newspaper Al-Ittihad.
   Subroto was in the emirates for discussions on the oil market
situation with U.A.E. leaders in advance of an OPEC pricing
committee meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland on Aug. 3.
   The state-run Al-Ittihad quoted Subroto as saying the world
market ``looks forward to positive results'' from the pricing
committee. It said he expressed his expectation of an increase in
oil prices over the coming weeks.
   In Subroto's view, the paper said, prices have been improving
because of the prospects of a peaceful end to the nearly 8-year-old
war between Iran and Iraq.
   That settlement would lead to a positive impact on the oil
market and oil prices, the paper further quoted Subroto as saying.
   But it said he could not predict whether prices would increase
beyond the OPEC benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   The pricing committee, whose members are oil ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and Venezuela, was meeting in
wake of Iran's decision to accept a U.N. Security Council
cease-fire resolution to end its war with Iraq.
   Subroto has toured OPEC member states seeking assurances about
compliance with the cartel's production quotas to help stabilize
oil prices around the $18 benchmark.
   Because of the war, Iraq has refused to accept its OPEC-decreed
quota and produces almost double what it is assigned. Meanwhile,
Iran is widely accused of discounting prices to market its crude
oil under the wartime conditions.
   That could change if the war came to an end, fueling hopes that
prices could rise.
   Other OPEC member states have also violated the cartel's
production and pricing rules.
   In June, the U.A.E. said it would ignore its OPEC oil production
quota of 948,000 barrels and produce about 1.5 million barrels per
day.
   Subroto has conferred with U.A.E. Oil Minister Mana Saeed Otaiba
and with U.A.E. President Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan to whom
he delivered a message from the OPEC president and Nigerian oil
minister, Rilwanu Lukman.
   The official Emirates news agency WAM reported after the
meetings Thursday that Sheik Zayed affirmed his nation's support
for ``unity and cohesion'' within OPEC.

<HEAD>Japan's First-Half Automobile Exports Down 5.1 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's exports of four-wheeled automobiles fell
5.1 percent during the first six months of this year from the same
period of 1987, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said
Friday.
   The association attributed the decline to the Japanese yen's
appreciation, which makes Japanese products less competitive abroad.
   Japanese car exports have been declining for two years. The last
time auto exports grew from year-earlier levels was in the first
half of 1986, when a 5.2-percent increase was reported.
   Expanding production in the United States by Japanese car makers
was another factor for the sustained fall in exports, the JAMA
report said.
   Exports of four-wheeled autos totaled 3.1 million in the first
half, the association said.
   Auto exports to the United States slid 17.5 percent to 1.3
million vehicles, accounting for 40.8 percent of the total
shipments to overseas markets.
   A total of 721,459 vehicles were exported to the European
Economic Community, down 3.2 percent from a year earlier.
   Those to Southeast and Northeast Asian countries, including
China, dipped 0.4 percent to 219,954 vehicles.

<HEAD>Japan's Unemployment Rate Reaches 67-Month Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High demand for workers resulting from rapid
economic growth pushed Japan's unemployment rate down to 2.4
percent in June, its lowest level in 67 months, the government
announced Friday.
   The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for June was 0.1
percentage point lower than in May and 0.6 percentage points below
the previous year's level, the Management and Coordination Agency
said.
   ``Many companies were eager to hire new workers because of the
economy's continuing expansion,'' an agency official said.
   The number of job holders during the month totaled nearly 61.1
million, equaling the record set in May, the agency said. The
number represented an increase of 1.1 million jobs from June 1987.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a sizable
number of workers had left their jobs voluntarily during the month.
   The number of jobs increased in virtually all sectors except for
agriculture, which experienced a drop of 1.4 percent, or 70,000
jobs, from the previous year, the agency said.
   Agency officials said the last time an unemployment rate of 2.4
percent was registered was in November 1982. A record low of 1.0
percent was set on three occasions: November 1968, November 1969
and March 1971.
   Japan's unemployment rate would be higher if it were calculated
by U.S. and European methods.
   In Japan, armed forces personnel and people who work more than
one hour in the last week of the month, when statistics are
tabulated, are counted as employed. In the United States, military
personnel are not considered part of the labor force, and those who
work less than 15 hours a week are considered unemployed.

   American Health Cos. Inc., parent of Diet
Center Inc., a franchiser of diet centers in North America, has
agreed to be acquired for $157 million by two investor groups.
   The company said Thursday the groups, CDI Holdings Inc. and DC
Acquisition Corp., will pay $22.50 per share to acquire about 6.95
million shares of American Health stock.
   American Health's common stock rose 25 cents in over-the-counter

   The sale was announced Thursday after a meeting of American
Health's board of directors in Salt Lake City.
   American Health spokesman Jim Liljenquist declined to discuss
why the company agreed to the proposal.
   Diet Center is a leading franchiser of diet and nutrition
centers, with about 2,300 outlets in the United States and Canada.
   Separately, American Health said Thursday it earned $3.5 million
in the first quarter of its fiscal year. The profit in the three
months ended June 30 was 16 percent higher than the $3 million
earned in the opening quarter of last year.

   Lloyds Bank PLC on Friday joined other major
British banks in announcing a return to profitability during the
first half of 1988 following its losses of a year ago.
   Lloyds said it had a net profit in the six months ended June 30
of 288 million pounds, the equivalent of $495 million, or 35 pence
a share, compared with a net loss of 516 million pounds in the same
period of 1987.
   The loss in the 1987 period, like those chalked up by other
major banks, was caused by Lloyds' additions to its reserves
against possible bad Third World loans.
   Revenue, which includes net interest income, foreign exchange,
commission, fees and other earnings, rose 11 percent to 1.46
billion pounds from 1.31 billion pounds.
   Interest income rose to 930 million pounds from 867 million
pounds.
   Lloyds' merchant bank recorded a profit of 5 million pounds,
compared with a loss of 32 million pounds a year ago.

<TEXT>
   Pearson PLC, the British conglomerate which
publishes the Financial Times, said Friday it sold its British oil
subsidiary, Whitehall Petroleum Ltd., to Amerada Hess Ltd. for $162
million in cash.
   Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive of Pearson, said
Whitehall's oil interests had potential but Pearson would have to
make a substantial capital investment in the subsidiary and wait
for years before it would make a significant contribution to the
conglomerate's profit.
   Sam Laidlaw, Amerada Hess Ltd.'s managing director, said the
acquisition ``is in line with our intention to further expand and
develop our North Sea interests.''
   Whitehall's principal assets are interests in Ivanhoe, Rob Roy
and the Waverley fields in the North Sea operated by Amerada Hess
Ltd. In addition, Whitehall has a portfolio of prospective acreage
with interests in 28 offshore licenses and 15 onshore licenses.
   Whitehall had operating profits of 2.5 million pounds, the
equivalent of $4.3 million, in 1987.
   Amerada Hess Ltd. is the British subsidiary of Amerada Hess
Corp. of the United States.
   The deal is subject to British regulatory approval, the
companies said.
   Publisher Rupert Murdoch acquired a stake of more than 20
percent in Pearson earlier this year, a move which Pearson called
unwelcome.

<TEXT>
   Koppers Co. said today a planned $660 million
leveraged buyout of its chemicals business has fallen through.
   The announcement came a day after sources disclosed new concerns
about the segment's environmental liabilities that jeopardized the
planned sale of the business to a group led by its management.
   British businessman Brian Beazer had counted on the sale of the
business to help finance his $1.8 billion takeover of Koppers Co.
While Beazer was going to sell the business segment, he would have
retained responsibility for its past environmental liabilities.
   Gordon Cain, head of Sterling Group of Houston and a specialist
in chemicals industry buyouts, was to be an equity partner with
management.
   Koppers said it is now free to consider other offers for the
business.
   ``We have received a number of inquiries relating to this
transaction over a period of several months,'' Beazer said this
morning by telephone from Koppers' headquarters in Pittsburgh.
   ``We have not pursued those inquiries because of our undertaking
to give exclusivity to the management group,'' he said. ``It is our
intention to seek purchasers of a serious nature immediately, and
that is already under way.''
   We do not expect any difficulty,'' Beazer said.
   Beazer, who prevailed June 1 in a bitter takeover battle against
Koppers' former top management, declined today to say whether he
intends to sell the chemicals group as an entity or in pieces.
   He said Thursday that discussions about the chemicals buyout
were continuing. But those last-ditch efforts proved fruitless.
   One official at Koppers headquarters, who would not speak for
attribution, said managers of the chemicals segment were being told
that a financial consultant to the deal had raised new concerns
about the extent of Koppers' environmental liabilities. That
apparently created differences over the agreed purchase price.
   Breaking up the chemicals group would be a blow to the nearly
2,700 Koppers employees who were expected to keep their jobs after
the buyout.
   The Pittsburgh company also has major interests in construction
materials, which Beazer wanted as an addition to his international
construction operations.
   Glen C. Tenley, slated to move from Koppers president and chief
operating officer to president and chief executive of the new
company, on Thursday referred questions to Beazer.
   A Wall Street securities analyst who follows Koppers said he was
not surprised by the reports that environmental issues were at the
root of the problem, although he said he was unaware of the snag.
   ``The company doesn't know what the liabilities are. The EPA
gets around to these plent sites one at a time, and until they get
around to some of these places, you don't know,'' he said, speaking
on condition he not be named.
   The analyst said Cain ``is a smart guy and usually he sets these
deals so that the environmental liabilities are covered. He's been
careful about that because it's sucn an open-ended thing.''
   Selling the chemicals businesses in pieces ``would take longer,
but they might get a better price,'' he said.
   In the battle against the Beazer group, Koppers' former top
management argued in court documents that with environmental
liabilities of $200 million over the next decade, the chemicals
business could not survive without cash from the construction
materials business.
   Tenley has estimated the segment's sales would grow from about
$600 million in 1987 to $1 billion in the 1990s. It had operating
profits of around $40 million last year.

   Crop futures opened higher today on the Chicago
Board of Trade with soybeans leading the rebound from the depressed
price levels of recent days.
   After falling for nine straight sessions, soybean futures are
priced at attractive levels for commercial processors who want to
hedge against a return to higher prices, analysts said.
   Corn futures also were attracting bargain hunters after
Thursday's steep declines.
   ``We've seen some commercial buying in everything today,'' said
Dale Gustafson, grain market analyst with the investment firm
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago. ``There's a little bit
better tone all around this morning.''
   The wheat market also was benefitting from prospects for a
pickup in export business, said said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with
Chicago-based G.H. Miller & Co.
   Analysts expected trading to become cautious ahead of the
National Weather Service's 30- and 90-day forecasts, which were due
out after the close.
   In early trading, wheat was 6 cents to 10 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.64 a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 3} cents higher with September at $2.68{ a bushel; oats
were 7 cents to the limit 10 cents higher with September at $2.65{
a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 11{ cents higher with August at
$7.53 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of the Agriculture Department's

   Should Americans be advising the Japanese on how to
take over American companies?
   The issue raised a rumpus among Americans in Tokyo recently
after the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan and the American
State Offices Association sponsored well-attended courses for
Japanese businessmen on how to acquire U.S. companies.
   Representatives of several state offices complained that such
seminars were against the rules of the Chamber of Commerce, and
both of the sponsors had to defend the seminars.
   ``To have a seminar here in Tokyo, a three-hour seminar, and not
touch on the subject of hostile takeovers would be incomplete,''
answered William Franklin, president of the Chamber of Commerce in
Japan, adding that the Chamber was not promoting hostile takeovers.
   The debate over Japanese takeovers is gaining momentum both here
and in the United States as Japanese investors expand their
American interests beyond government securities and real estate.
Just last week, Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest securities
house, bought a 20 percent stake in Wasserstein, Perella & Co., one
of America's hottest merger-and-acquisition firms.
   Speakers at the Japanese seminars described how to target U.S.
companies for acquisition, how to prepare proxy statements for the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and ways to avoid antagonizing
American employees and customers of the companies they are taking
over.
   Also covered were such subjects as how to conduct friendly,
neutral or hostile takeovers.
   An accountant told the businessmen how to spot companies in
trouble, a businessman told them how to recognize and avoid bluffs
by American companies, and another participant advised the Japanese
that they often paid more for American companies than necessary.
   Billy Cody, director of Oregon's representative office in Japan,
said the state offices association ``has no business teaching
Japanese how to take over an American company, whether or not it
wants to be taken over.''
   The American State Offices Association, which represents the 39
U.S. states with offices in Japan to promote trade and investment
in their states, sent out a letter saying it does not censor
speeches of experts who appear at such seminars.
   The association does not ``in any way promote hostile takeovers
by Japanese companies in the U.S., and data substantiates that this
is not even a primary or common form of Japanese investment in the
United States,'' the letter said.
   The course was first offered in Osaka, attended by more than 100
persons, many of them Japanese businessmen. Following objections
over a portion of the course that dwelt on hostile takeovers, the
course was modified and offered again in early July in Tokyo,
drawing more than 150 businessmen, most of them Japanese.
   Franklin said mergers and acquisitions are a fact of life in
American business, and the seminars were designed to make the
Japanese better informed.
   The controversy placed the Chamber in an awkward situation,
because it wants to guide the Japanese in investing their surplus
cash in the United States, and thus to stave off protectionist
sentiment in Congress.
   The U.S. government and many American companies have welcomed
Japanese investment, as long as U.S. management is left intact, and
American consultants are active in Tokyo advising the Japanese on
takeover prospects.
   So far, Japanese companies have been content to play the role of
``white knights'' who rescue companies from unwanted invaders.
However, participants at the seminars urged the Japanese to be more
aggressive and seek out companies that might be ripe for mergers.
   Mie Teno, chairman of the Invest in U.S.A. Committee of the
Chamber of Commerce, told the Tokyo seminar that mergers and
acquisitions are a good way to get into business in the United
States quickly and without a lot of startup costs.
   Compared with the United States, where takeovers are commonplace
and even the biggest corporations are targets, there are few
takeovers in Japan. Japanese companies tend to hold large blocks of
each other's stock permanently, creating alliances and making it
difficult to mount a hostile takeover attempt.
   Cody said Japanese companies have a paternalistic feeling toward
their employees and believe that selling part of their company is
like selling a member of the family.
   ``Not only would this not happen in Japan, government and
businesses would work together to prevent it,'' the Oregon
representative said.
   According to Yamaichi Securities Co., Japanese companies
concluded 469 mergers and acquisitions in 1987, and 451 in 1986. Of
those mergers, more than 200 each year were outside Japan. Last
year, for the first time, foreign takeovers by Japanese companies
exceeded domestic takeovers.
   Only about 22 foreign companies in 1986 and 25 in 1987 were able
to acquire Japanese companies, according to an investment broker
who asked that he not be identified.
   The first foreign hostile takeover bid against a major Japanese
firm ended in failure last year when Trafalgar Holdings Ltd. of the
United States and Glen International of Britain sold the shares
they had acquired in the Japanese Minebea Co. The Japanese
government had decided that much of Minebea's business was
defense-related and should not be sold to an outsider.

   The stock market marched ahead in moderate
trading today as a stable bond market buoyed investor enthusiasm
for equities.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 15.29 at 2,097.62
at midday.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 808 issues up, 413
down and 532 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 89.72 million shares as of noon
on Wall Street.
   Traders said a stronger bond market helped support equities. In
addition, investors welcomed comments by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan who indicated Thursday that the Fed hasn't changed
monetary policy recently.
   ``It must mean investors are more comfortable with the interest
rate scenario,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a trader with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., who said the strong opening was a
follow-through to Thursday's rally.
   Greenspan also supported the current level of the dollar against
the major foreign currencies. But while a firmer dollar helped the
stock market on the opening, there were reports that the Fed and
other European central banks were intervening to stem the dollar's
rise.
   Technology issues, often a leading force in the stock market,
were showing strength. ``We'll see if this market can hang on'' as
the Dow approaches 2,100, a key resistance level, Vandenberg said.
   Among actively traded issues IBM was up 1 at 124}; Union Carbide
was up 1{ at 23; Texaco was down { at 47, and Eastman Kodak was up
| at 45\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.98 to 151.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 304.34, up 0.71.

<HEAD>Aetna Reports 32 Percent Drop In Operating Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aetna Life & Casualty reported Friday its
second-quarter earnings dropped 45 percent, due in part to a $45.1
million charge in connection with its coverage of A.H. Robins Co.
   Aetna said its second quarter earnings totaled $136 million, or
$1.19 per share, down from $248 million, or $2.12 per share, in the
same quarter of 1987.
   The results reflect the after-tax charge resulting from the
reorganization of Robins. The charge is in addition to reserves
previously established by Aetna for insurance obligations for
claims by users of Robins' Dalkon Shield intrauterine devices.
   Aetna's second-quarter earnings also were depressed by a $17
million capital loss and lower tax benefits in the prior year.
   Revenue rose to $6.33 billion from $5.54 billion in the second
three months of 1987.
   Aetna Chairman James T. Lynn called the results in line with the
company's expectations.
   Net income for the first six months of the year was $268
million, or $2.33 per common share, compared with $469 million, or
$4.03 per common share, for the first half of 1987.
   First-half revenue increased to $12.3 billion from $10.66
billion.
   As of June 30, 1988, Aetna's total assets were $75.7 billion, 6
percent greater than a year ago.

   The stock market moved sharply higher in
moderate trading today as gains in the bond market buoyed investor
enthusiasm for equities.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 33.60 to 2,115.93
at midafternoon.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 12 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 984 issues up, 413
down and 484 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 133.36 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   The Dow opened higher and advanced in a measured manner,
piercing the 2,100 level at midday. ``We'll see if this market can
hang on,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a trader at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Analysts said the gains reflected fresh strength in the bond
market. In addition, investors continued to react favorably to
comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who indicated
Thursday that the Fed hasn't changed monetary policy recently.
   ``Those comments encouraged people to believe interest rates are
not going to go up any further and maybe even go down,'' said
Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp.
   With the spotlight off interest rates, Jensen said investors
were able to turn their attention to the flood of positive
corporate earnings reports that have been pouring in over the past
few weeks.
   ``We've had very good earnings, but most of the stocks did not
participate last week'' because of fear that higher interest rates
would dilute corporate profits down the road, Jensen said.
   Much of the day's activity centered on blue-chip issues.
Strategies to capture quarterly dividends also accounted for a fair
share of overall volume.
   Technology issues, often a leading force in the stock market,
were showing strength.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was up 1| at 125];
Union Carbide, which withdrew a planned offering of 15 million
common shares, was up 1~ at 23], and Eastman Kodak was up ~ at 45{
amid rumors the company may sell its household products division
for as much as $2 billion.
   Public Service of New Mexico, which was unchanged at 15, was the
most active issue with 22 million shares changing hands as traders
moved to capture the utility's quarterly dividend.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.97 to 152.37. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 305.09, up 1.46.

   Prices closed higher on London's Stock Exchange in
a lazy session Friday, spurred upward by a strong start on Wall

   Dealers said interest in the overall market continued to sag, as
only speculative activity in certain stocks drove the market higher.

<HEAD>Dukakis Allies With Management In Fighting Hostile Takeovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Revlon Group made a hostile bid to seize
Boston's own Gillette Co., Gov. Michael S. Dukakis engineered
passage of a state anti-takeover law and signed it with fanfare on
a Gillette softball fied.
   When Campeau Corp. bought Federated Department Stores, Dukakis
asked the Federal Trade Commission to review the $6.6 billion
purchase, which included Filene's Basement, the discount store
where the governor buys his suits.
   On the campaign trail, the Democratic presidential nominee has
said ``merger-mania'' is ``tearing companies apart as if they were
erector sets.'' And he has called for tougher enforcement of
federal antitrust laws and regulations to protect management
against takeover artists seeking to make a fast buck.
   In a state where sharks circle regularly around corporate giants
such as Gillette and Polaroid Corp., Dukakis, portrayed as a
liberal by his Republican opponents, has forged an alliance with
management in attacking corporate raiders.
   ``He's very concerned about hostile takeovers that lead to
protracted battles, cost jobs, might result in paying greenmail and
don't create new economic value,'' said Harvard Business School
Professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
   ``However, he's very well aware that there are a large number of
mergers and acquisitions and some takeovers that replace weak
management with stronger management or result in combinations that
do create new economic value,'' the Dukakis adviser said this past
week.
   Wall Street analysts acknowledge some trepidation among
potential buyers over a possible Dukakis presidency. Some fear he
will try to curb takeovers; others worry that a recession will
dampen the merger wave, as it did after last year's stock market
crash. With the future uncertain, merger activity has spurted in
recent months.
   ``There is some basis to say that were Dukakis to win, then
antitrust enforcement would be more vigorous than under the Reagan
Administration,'' said Les Fabuss, senior vice president for
mergers at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``But I don't think Dukakis
would be Draconian on this. He tends to be middle-of-the-road is my
impression.''
   Dukakis is on the record supporting measures to curb hostile
takeovers, including:
   _A Senate bill sponsored by Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., to
force raiders to make their efforts more public.
   _Outlawing greenmail, the premium paid by a company to buy back
stock from a raider who agrees to drop a takeover bid.
   _Reducing the 10-day period in which a company can acquire a
block of another company's stock without disclosing whether it
intends to mount a takeover.
   _Stricter enforcement of antitrust and insider trading laws.
   _Barring firms from using pension fund surpluses to repay debts
incurred during takeover financing.
   ``I don't want to stop mergers and acquisitions in this
country,'' the candidate told Forbes magazine in an interview
appearing in the Aug. 8 issue. ``But you've got a lot of
responsible business people who would suggest that there are
reasonable rules of the game, beginning with antitrust policy that
you can believe in.''
   In high-tech Massachusetts, Dukakis has tried to discourage
hostile takeovers that force companies relying on long-term
research and development to focus on boosting short-term profits to
defend against raiders.
   Massachusetts' anti-takeover law followed Revlon chairman Ronald
O. Perelman's failed bid for Gillette in 1986, in which the
personal care giant paid $558 million to buy back 9.2 million
shares of stock. Gillette currently is involved in a legal battle
with Coniston Group of New York, which wants to gain control of the
company and sell it to the highest bidder.
   In February, when Stop & Shop Cos. came under siege from the
Dart Group, Dukakis co-sponsored legislation giving corporate
directors the right to consider the interests of workers, the
community and the economy in weighing a takeover. The bill died in
committee after the takeover attempt failed.
   Dukakis also commissioned a panel from government, business,
labor and academia to assess Massachusetts' anti-takeover law,
similar to ones passed in about 20 other states, and report to him
by October.
   Under the state law, the voting rrs acquiring 20
percent of a company can be suspended for up to 50 days so
management and shareholders can evaluate the bid.
   Opponents maintain that anti-takeover laws strip power from
stockholders and allow incumbenights of investot management to perpetuate
inefficiency by failing to respond to market forces.
   ``If they fall short, there's nobody there to snap at their
heels and say, `Improve your performance or we can make more money
for the shareholders,''' said Joseph Lufkin of the United
Shareholders Association. ``They don't feel the pressure to
compete.''
   Coniston partner Paul E. Tierney, who supports Dukakis'
presidential bid, said anti-takeover legislation has made strange
bedfellows of Democratic politicians like Dukakis and typically
conservative company management.
   ``I think (Democratic legislators') hearts are with the work
force in Massachusetts, but they are passing laws and giving
speeches that essentially protect m Salvador's history, has
benefited more than half a million people since its inception in
1980 and is radically changing the social structure of the
countryside. Land reform was designed, principally by U.S.
officials, as a means of undercutting the leftist guerrillas in
their efforts to win the sympathy of the rural poor. The process
has cost almost $300 million, most of it provided by the United
States.

   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government said the economy expanded at a healthy 3.1
percent annual pace from April through June, but rising food,
energy and clothing costs pushed the inflation rate to 4.7 percent,
its highest level in almost six years. Another quarterly report
showed the price of imported goods rose 2.7 percent in the
April-June period. Other reports showed big jumps in consumer
spending and orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket'' durable
goods during June.
   _The Labor Department said major collective bargaining
settlements in private industry during the first six months of this
year resulted in wage increases averaging 2.2 percent a year, a
slight decline from the average increases negotiated two to three
years ago.
   _A real estate trade group said sales of existing homes rose in
June to the highest level in a year and a half as buyers tried to
beat out rising mortgage rates.
   _The most comprehensive banking bill since the Great Depression

   The dollar was higher against major currencies in
European markets Friday in expectation of higher U.S. interest
rates and despite heavy intervention by central banks.
   Gold and silver rose.
   The dollar was bolstered because ``all the signs point to a
higher interest rate environment'' in the United States, according
to Marek Stefamovicz, a corporate advisor at Nomura Bank
International.
   He and other dealers said the market interpreted remarks
Thursday by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to mean
monetary authorities in the United States are worried about
inflationary pressures.
   In particular, they pointed to Greenspan's comment that he found
the 4.1 percent inflation rate in the second quarter, as indicated
by the gross national product deflator, ``a bit surprising.''
   Dealers in Frankfurt said repeated dollar sales by the U.S.
Federal Reserve, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Swiss National Bank
and the Nederlandsche Bank could not contain the U.S. currency's
strength.
   Both the Bank of Italy and the Swiss monetary authorities also
confirmed their intervention.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7105, cheaper for
buyers than $1.7225 Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday
rates, included: 1.8750 West German marks, up from 1.8645; 1.5615
Swiss francs, up from 1.5505; 6.3202 French francs, up from 6.2885;
2.1185 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0920; 1,377.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,370.50; 1.2105 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2086.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to a closing 132.53. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 133.05 yen.
   The spot price of gold rose on technical factors, although
trading was generally quiet, traders in Zurich said.
   Dealers said that after gold broke through the $435 level in the
European afternoon, the outlook for the price improved.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $435.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $433.
   In Zurich, gold was higher, closing at a bid of $436.50 compared
with $432.50 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid price of $434.48, up
from Thursday's closing bid price of $433.78.
   Later, silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.81 a
troy ounce, up from Thursday's $6.79.

   The stock market moved sharply higher in
moderate trading today as fears of higher interest rates abated,
whetting investors' appetite for equities.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 36.27 at 2,118.60
an hour before the closing bell.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by roughly 3 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,110 issues
up, 358 down and 456 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 159.65 million shares as of 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   The Dow opened higher and advanced in a measured manner,
piercing the 2,100 level at midday.
   Analysts said the gains reflected fresh strength in the bond
market. In addition, investors continued to react favorably to
comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who indicated
Thursday that the Fed hasn't changed monetary policy recently.
   ``Those comments encouraged people to believe interest rates are
not going to go up any further and maybe even go down,'' said
Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp.
   With the spotlight off interest rates, Jensen said investors
were able to turn their attention to the flood of positive
corporate earnings reports that have been pouring in over the past
few weeks.
   ``We've had very good earnings, but most of the stocks did not
participate last week'' because of fear that higher interest rates
would dilute corporate profits down the road, Jensen said.
   Much of the day's activity centered on blue-chip issues.
Strategies to capture quarterly dividends also accounted for a fair
share of overall volume.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was up 1~ at 125|;
Union Carbide, which withdrew a planned offering of 15 million
common shares, was up 2 at 23{, and Eastman Kodak was up 1 at 45|
amid rumors the company may sell its household products division
for as much as $2 billion.
   Public Service of New Mexico, which was unchanged at 15, was the
most active issue with 22 million shares changing hands as traders
moved to capture the utility's quarterly dividend.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.25 to 152.65. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 305.39, up 1.76.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and sobyean futures scored their first
major advance in more than two weeks Friday, closing sharply higher
in a rebound sparked by a basketful of bullish factors.
   ``Mr. Excitement jumped in here today,'' said Jerry Gidel, an
analyst with G.H. Miller & Co. in Chicago.
   Most corn and soybean futures soared their respective daily
limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel while the limitless August
soybean contract gained more than 34 cents.
   After more than a week of generally falling prices across the
board, an overnight increase in cash corn prices spurred some
hedge-type buying of corn futures by commercial grain dealers and
processors, analysts said.
   The depressed soybean market also attracted bargain hunters
while wheat gained on news of a 400,000-metric-ton sale of U.S.
wheat to China and on the Agriculture Department's decision not to
reduce for next year the portion of the acreage wheat growers must
set aside to qualify for federal price supports.
   A rumor later in the day that the Soviet Union was in the market
for corn prompted further buying of corn futures.
   A soybean production estimate of 1.56 billion bushels by
meatpacker Conagra Corp., compared to the Agriculture Department's
latest estimate of 1.65 billion bushels, added further support to
the soybeans, analysts said.
   And private weather forecasts reducing the prospects for rain
this weekend in the drought-stricken Farm Belt lent strength across
the board.
   At the close, wheat was 10 cents to 17 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.68 a bushel; corn was 6
cents to 10 cents higher with September at $2.75 a bushel; oats
were 7 cents to the limit 15 cents higher with September at $2.71{
a bushel; soybeans were 9{ cents to 34{ cents higher with August at
$7.76 a bushel.

   The stock market advanced broadly today as fears
of higher interest rates abated and a vibrant technical rally took
hold.
   Analysts said much of the day's gains reflected fresh strength
in the credit markets, where bond prices rose and interest rates
declined.
   Stock prices opened higher and advanced in a measured manner
throughout the session. Analysts said computer-triggered buy
programs helped boost the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
beyond the 2,100 mark, a key pscyhological barrier, at about midday.
   With the Dow firmly above that level, institutional investors,
believing that a foundation had been built for a further advance,
left the sidelines in search of equities, said Philip Puccio, a
senior vice president at Dillon, Read & Co.
   Analysts said that as long a the bond market holds onto its
gains, there is an incentive for the stock market's summer rally to
resume.

<TEXT>
   Koppers Co. on Friday announced the collapse
of a $660 million deal to sell its chemicals division to a
management-led group.
   The sale would have helped British construction magnate Brian
Beazer finance his $1.8 billion purchase of Koppers. Beazer said he
was optimistic other buyers could be found for the chemicals
business.
   The announcement came a day after sources said that recent
concerns about the chemical segment's environmental liabilities
were jeopardizing the agreement for Beazer to sell the operations
to managers and their outside partner.
   Beazer and his takeover partners, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
and a British bank, had agreed to remain responsible for the
environmental liabilities after the leveraged buyout.
   Beazer expressed confidence Friday that a sale can be arranged
with other parties.
   ``We have received a number of inquiries relating to this
transaction over a period of several months,'' he said by telephone
from Koppers headquarters in Pittsburgh. ``We have not pursued
those inquiries because of our undertaking to give exclusivity to
the management group. It is our intention to seek purchasers of a
serious nature immediately, and that is already under way. We do
not expect any difficulty.''
   Beazer gave the managers the exclusive right to negotiate for
the business. The managers will now have to compete with outside
bidders if they are to salvage their plan.
   Asked what killed the management-led buyout, Beazer told The
Pittsburgh Press ``you should ask Gordon Cain. We have a signed
contract and are prepared to honor it.''
   Cain, head of The Sterling Group of Houston, is a chemicals
industry financier. He was an equity partner with the Koppers
managers and was announced as the chairman of the new Koppers
Chemical Co.
   Cain's office on Friday referred all questions to Koppers.
   Glen C. Tenley, the Koppers president and chief operating
officer who was to become president and chief executive of Koppers
Chemical, was out of his office Friday and not expected back until
Monday, a secretary said.
   Beazer said Thursday that discussions were continuing, in an
apparent last-ditch effort to save the chemicals buyout.
   After bitter resistance in federal court, Koppers' former top
management conceded defeat and agreed June 1 to sell the company
for $61 per share to Beazer and Shearon Lehman Hutton.
   Beazer wanted Koppers in order to add its construction materials
business to his international construction operations.
   The ousted management estimated the chemical segment's
environmental liabilities as $200 million over the next decade.

   Times Mirror Co. said a deal to trade its
cable television operations in Arizona for cable properties owned
by Tele-Communications Inc. and United Artists Communications has
collapsed.
   The decision to call off the deal, which was announced in March,
``was a mutual agreement between all three parties,'' Times Mirror,
owner of the Los Angeles Times, Newsday, and the Baltimore Sun
papers, said Thursday.
   The swap, valued by analysts at about $740 million, involved
Times Mirror's cable franchises in Phoenix, Bullhead City, Casa
Grande, Lake Havasu and Nogales, Arizona. In return, the company
was to get Tele-Communications' cable syustems in Reno and Carson
City, Nev., South Lake Tahoe, Calif., and Zanesville, Ohio; and
United Artists properties in Brookhaven, N.Y., Decatur, Ill., and
Taunton and North Attleboro, Mass.
   A separate agreement for Times Mirror to buy
Tele-Communications' cable system in Rock Island, Ill., also fell
through, the company said.

<TEXT>
   The first big failure of a leveraged buyout
failed to stir the junk-bond market Friday, and analysts predicted
the bankruptcy filing by drugstore chain Revco D.S. Inc. would
concern few holders of other high-risk corporate bonds.
   Revco, which announced its filing Thursday, is the only major
company to seek protection from its creditors after going private
in a junk-bond financed buyout.
   ``Many people had expected it (the Chapter 11 filing),'' said
Robert Waill, managing director and junk bond analyst at L.F.
Rothschild & Co. in New York. ``There had been a general
understanding from investors that this was risky ...''
   The Twinsburg, Ohio-based company failed to make a June interest
payment on about $700 million in outstanding debt that was used to
go private 19 months ago. The company sought protection from
creditors after talks with bondholders broke down.
   ``There was no ripple effect,'' said Robert Levine, director of
high-yield bond research for Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York.
   As a result, traders said, prices of most junk bonds remained
fairly firm in the secondary market Friday, including some of
Revco's securities.
   Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk notes commonly issued to
fund leveraged buyouts and other types of corporate takeovers. In a
leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds
that are repaid with the company's cash flow or sale of its assets.
   Some traders and analysts even predicted that Revco bonds might
rebound after the chain files its reoganization plan with the
bankruptcy court and gets back on its feet financially.
   All of Revco's debt had been considered speculative grade, or
``junk,'' a category assigned by the big credit-rating services for
companies considered more likely to default on their bonds due to a
variety of reasons, including tough economic conditions in a
particular industry.
   Junk bond yields are generally three- to four percentage points
higher than comparable Treasury bonds to compensate for their low
rating, making them attractive to some investors.
   The majority of junk bond buyers are large sophisticated
institutional investors, rather than individuals, who diversify
their portfolios enough to compensate for future risks.
   Revco's problem resulted from the heavy debt load incurred as a
result of its leveraged buyout in December 1986. The company listed
its total debt as $1.5 billion in the bankruptcy filing.
   Chairman Boake A. Sells said Thursday that the company's
investment adviser planned to propose a recapitalization that would
have swapped equity in Revco for debt, but he said discussions with
major bondholders broke down even before the plan was proposed.
   Sells maintained that most of Revco's 2,000 drug stores were
profitable but that the company was not generating enough cash to
both operate its business and make millions of dollars in annual
interset payments.
   Revco is the only leveraged buyout company that has failed to
meet its obligations to bondholders, according to Gail I. Hessol, a
managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp.
   In all of 1987 there was a record $9 billion in corporate
defaults, she said. As of June 21, there were $2 billion in
defaults.
   Waill said as a result of the Revco filing, ``I don't think
people would say that this teaches us a lesson (that) we should be
more careful of LBOs.''
   ``Investors tend to look at this as an isolated, separate event
which was determined by its own particulars,'' he said. ``Unlike
high-grade bonds, each of these (junk bond) companies lives its own
life.''

   Oil prices made slight gains Friday in light
trading dominated mostly by technical factors.
   Traders said activity was slowed in advance of the weekend and
in anticipation of a possible meeting next week of OPEC's pricing
committee.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark U.S.
grade, gained 16 cents to settle at $16.31 a barrel.
   Among refined products, the August contract for wholesale
unleaded gasoline attracted the most activity on its last day of
trading. The contract lost .21 cent to settle at 51.74 cents per
gallon, while prices for later months advanced slightly.
   The August contract for heating oil, which also expired, gained
.32 cent to 44.66 cents per gallon.
   ``You have a market that's tired of being news generated ... and
is trading flat,'' explained Greg Dreis of Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.
   Traders began heading to the sidelines of the volatile market
Thursday, showing reluctance to make big commitments in advance of
the Aug. 3 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries' pricing committee.
   The Lausanne, Switzerland session is expected to deal with the
13-nation cartel's continuing overproduction problems, which have
helped depress prices.

   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. fired a broker
Friday and Advest Inc. said it suspended one in connection with a
widening probe of possibly fraudulent trading based on advance
leaks of Business Week articles.
   Another firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., disclosed that up to
three former brokers may have traded improperly on advance
knowledge of the information as well.
   And R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. of Chicago, one of the companies
that prints Business Week, said federal authorities had subpoenaed
lists of its employees at two printing plants near the offices
where the affected brokers worked.
   The moves came a day after Merrill Lynch Inc. said it had fired
a broker because of suspicious trades surrounding stocks touted in
Business Week.
   Prudential-Bache said it had dismissed Brian Callahan, a broker
in its 33-member office in Anaheim, Calif., after it detected
questionable trading by him. The firm said it had notified the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that
enforces securities laws.
   Peter Costiglio, a spokesman at Prudential-Bache's headquarters
in New York, said Callahan, 28, had worked for the firm for about
3{ years.
   Executives at Prudential-Bache's Anaheim office referred all
queries about Callahan to Costiglio, who said he did not know the
whereabouts of the broker.
   Directory assistance said there was no listing for a Brian
Callahan in Anaheim.
   Advest, based in Hartford, Conn., said the broker it suspended
worked in the firm's office in New London, Conn., where 10 brokers
are based. Spokeswoman Martha Payne declined to disclose the
broker's identity or career history.
   ``The suspension was the result of an internal investigation
which we conducted,'' she said. ``We've notified the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The investigation is continuing.''
   Shearson said in a statement that an undisclosed number of
ex-brokers in the Hartford, Conn., office of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc., which Shearson acquired last December, ``may have accepted
and executed trades based on advance knowledge of articles that
were published in Business Week.''
   A source at Shearson, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
at least one and possibly three brokers were involved, but said
their whereabouts were not clear.
   The statement said the questionable trades occured prior to the
acquisition and the brokers are no longer with the company. It said
the SEC and New York Stock Exchange had been notified but provided
no further details.
   The disclosures widened to four the number of brokerages
involved since Business Week, the nation's leading business weekly
with a circulation of nearly 1 million, said last week it was
investigating whether stock trading was occuring based on leaks of
its unpublished ``Inside Wall Street'' columns.
   Evidence uncovered so far suggests that workers who print
Business Week shared information about the market-moving columns
with brokers before the magazine was available to the public.
   Two of the four plants that publish Business Week are in Old
Saybrook, Conn., near New London; and in Torrance, Calif., near
Anaheim.
   Business Week officials have said there is no indication that
any of the magazine's editorial staff is involved.
   Lawyers likened the situation to the securities fraud case
brought against former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster
Winans, who sold tips about his impending stock columns to broker
Peter N. Brant. Both were convicted for trading based on stolen
confidential information.
   Merrill Lynch said Thursday it had fired broker William Dillon
from its New London office after investigating a pattern of
suspicious trading he conducted on stocks featured in ``Inside Wall
Street.''
   Dillon did not return phone calls to his home in Old Lyme,
Conn., seeking comment.
   People familiar with Merrill's internal probe, who spoke on
condition they not be identified, also said a second broker in the
firm's New London office, James Smith, was under investigation but
no disciplinary action had been taken against him. Smith's
secretary said he was unavailable for comment.
   Business Week, published by McGraw-Hill Inc., said on July 21
that its legal counsel was examining the entire operation for
possible leaks.
   The magazine has retained a high-powered New York detective
agency, Kroll Associates, to assist its investigation. Kroll has
been involved in several major securities probes, particularly
those involving insider trading, proxy fights and hostile takeovers.
   Business Week ackowledged it was investigating possible leaks
after Dow Jones Professional Investor Report made the initial
disclosure about possible misuse of information in the column.
   Professional Investor Report said its analysis of 20 stocks
mentioned in the column had found at least eight rose sharply the
day the magazines came off the presses but before they were
available to the public.
   The SEC and the major stock exchanges also are investigating the
matter.
   Donnelley, which operates the Old Saybrook and Torrance plants,
said that it was conducting its own investigation into possible
leaks and that anyone accused of wrongdong faced disciplinary
action.
   James Ratcliffe, a spokesman for Donnelley, said Friday that the
SEC had subpoenaed lists of employee names and addresses at the two
plants and that the firm's own investigators had intervewed more
than 21 workers.

<HEAD>Giant Japanese Bond Issue Helps Fill Triple-A Void</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese have invaded the U.S. financial
markets in a big way again.
   In Samurai style, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. issued
$500 million in 10-year notes _ one of the largest foreign bond
issues ever floated in this country, according to its underwriters.
   The July 19 issue was snapped up by U.S. institutional investors
hungry for old-fashioned, triple-A bonds, even if they aren't
American.
   With a dwindling number of triple-A U.S. corporate bonds now on
the market, analysts say there's plenty of room for ``Yankee
bonds'' issued by foreign governments and companies to raise
capital _ most of which also carry the top rating.
   ``Yankee bonds'' are issued in the United States by foreign
entities and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   ``I don't see any kind of volume that can't be absorbed,'' said
Jim Nickelson, a senior vice president of Daiwa Securities Inc.
``There haven't been enough (triple-A) issues to really saturate
the market.''
   In recent years, a number of major U.S. banks that had enjoyed
triple-A ratings were stripped of them by the credit-rating
agencies after they took steep losses on loans to developing
countries. Some big oil companies were similarly downgraded after
the world oil price slide in 1985.
   Even more recently, the surge in corporate takeover activity in
this country has brought downgraded ratings for some blue-chip
companies that piled up their debt to pay for big acquisitions.
   ``Dwindling ranks, no question about that,'' said John Lonski,
senior economist for Moody's Investors Service, referring to the
number of triple-A U.S. companies. Moody's is one of the top rating
agencies, along with Standard & Poor's Corp.
   There are currently 13 U.S. companies with triple-A ratings from
both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, Lonski noted, down from 18 in
1981.
   The survivors include International Business Machines Corp.,
Exxon Corp., Amoco Corp., Procter & Gamble Co., Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co., Aetna Life & Casualty Co. and some of the regional
telephone companies.
   There's a peculiar irony here. Some U.S. industrial giants, like
General Motors Corp., lost their triple-A imprimaturs largely as a
result of competition from Japanese companies. Now, Japanese
conglomerates like Nippon Telegraph and Japan Air Lines are jumping
into the triple-A void with big bond issues in the United States.
   Like Nippon Telegraph, other foreign companies have been raising
capital in the United States with big bond issues. Earlier this
month, the West German Bank for Economic Progress sold $300 million
in 10-year notes in the U.S. market. And the governments of Sweden
and Finland recently issued what Daiwa's Nickelson calls ``real
barn-burners'' _ 40- and 50-year bonds that fetched high prices.
   Conservative U.S. investors ``love the Yankee bond market,''
said Larry Kreicher, an international economist and bond strategist
for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   Many of the foreign bonds offer investors high-quality,
regulated securities which still sell for less than U.S. Treasury
issues, Kreicher explained. He noted that the ``Yankee'' market has
grown from $3.7 billion in 1985 to a projected $6.8 billion this
year.
   What makes the Nippon Telegraph issue noteworthy is the size of
the company as well as the magnitude of the sale. The Japanese
utility can be considered the biggest company in the world, with a
stock market value of around $300 billion.
   That's equivalent to the combined market values of these giants:
IBM, Exxon (both rated triple-A), General Electric Co., American
Telephone and Telegraph Co., Ford Motor Co., GM, Merck & Co. Inc.,
Philip Morris Companies Inc. and Du Pont, according to the
investment firm Goldman, Sachs & Co.
   The Nippon Telegraph sale was ``a museum-piece issue,'' said
Michael Lynch, a senior partner in the Global Finance Department of
Goldman, Sachs, the lead underwriter of the issue. ``It's such a
strong entity ... It's hard to extricate it from the Japanese
economy.''
   The giant utility had been part of the Japanese government until
April 1985, when the government sold 25 percent of its shares to
the public.
   Other state-owned Japanese companies that are on the drawing
boards to be privatized in the near future _ such as Japanese
National Railways and Japan Tobacco Co. _ also are strong
candidates for bond issues in the U.S. market.

Possibilities</HEAD>

   Macmillan Inc., the target of a pair of
unsolicited takeover bids, said Friday its board has authorized
management to evaluate the possibility of selling all or parts of
the company and other options.
   The publishing and information services concern said the board
gave those instructions as it voted to oppose a tender offer from a
group led by Texas investor Robert M. Bass that values the company
at $1.9 billion. The board called the bid inadequate.
   Macmillan said its board authorized management to explore a
variety of alternatives, including another version of its proposed
restructuring that has been tied up in court, a merger or the sale
of all or parts of the company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Macmillan said it had discussed with unidentified third parties
``their interest in a possible acquisition of all or part of the
company'' but that no negotiations occurred.
   The company said it had provided confidential information to one
third party and might provide information to others, and said it
could engage in negotiations in the future.
   But at the same time, the company said the board reaffirmed its
intention for a vigorous appeal of a Delaware court decision that
blocked implementation of its restructuring plan. The company said
the appeal would be heard Aug. 15.
   The announcement of the board's rejection of the $75-a-share
tender offer launched last week by the Bass Group came as no
surprise.
   British entrepreneur Robert Maxwell already indicated he was
prepared to offer $80 a share under certain conditions for all of
Macmillan's 25.9 million shares, or about $2.06 billion.
   On Wall Street, traders anticipated that the bidding for
Macmillan might go higher. Macmillan rose 87{ cents a share to
$84.62{ in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Bruce Thorp, a media analyst for Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia, said he thought Macmillan's top priority was to
pursue its restructuring.
   If the Delaware Supreme Court refused to allow the company to
proceed with the current restructuring plan, Thorp said the company
might then have to seek outside help to sweeten its restructuring
plan or find a friendly buyer.
   Bert Boksen, who follows the publishing business for Raymond
James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., said the board appeared
to have told management to ``come up with a reasonable
alternative.''
   ``This forces Macmillan management to respond to legitimate
offers,'' he said. Boksen said management might well find ``the
course of least resistance would be to find suitable buyer for the
whole company.''
   Thorp repeated his estimate that Macmillan might be worth about
$85 a share, while Boksen said it could be worth about $90 a share.
   In its statement, Macmillan said its board rejected the latest
Bass offer at a meeting on Thursday, and would recommend to
Macmillan shareholders that they not tender their shares under
terms of that offer.
   A call was placed to the Bass Group, which is based in Fort
Worth, Texas, but its spokesman was said to be unavailable for
comment.
   Macmillan said its board was notified about Maxwell's proposal,
but ``determined to review that proposal in due course in light of
the company's other alternatives.''
   The Bass Group, which owns a 9.1 percent stake in Macmillan,
proposed in mid-May to pay $64 a share for the Macmillan stock it
did not already own.
   Macmillan subsequently proposed a restructuring that would pay
shareholders a special dividend and split the company into two
separate entities, a publishing company and an information services
concern.
   The Bass Group challenged the restructuring plan in Delaware
Chancery Court, which blocked Macmillan from putting it into
effect. Bass also sweetened its bid for Macmillan, first to $73 a
share and then to $75 a share and launched a tender offer at the
higher price on July 18.
   Maxwell's proposal contained several conditions, including
Macmillan's dropping the restructuring plan. Maxwell Communications
Corp., the company Maxwell heads, is the largest printer in
Britain, owns the Mirror Group of newspapers there and publishes
scientific journals.
   Maxwell has said he wants to make his company one of the world's
largest communications concerns and has spent $1 billion making
smaller acquisitions in the United States over the past year. He
failed in a bid last year to acquire Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc., a Florida-based publishing, insurance and theme park concern.

<TEXT>
   The federal government and the New York Stock
Exchange said Friday they are examining an apparently bogus claim
of a large investment in General Cinema Corp. that triggered a
sharp rise in the price of the company's stock.
   Securities experts said the filing by an unknown London man from
a fictitious London address of a 6.1 percent stock acquisition in
the soft drink bottler and movie theater operator raises questions
about Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.
   ``It's very disconcerting,'' said Sam Scott Miller, a New York
securities lawyer. ``The system is designed to provide for very
speedy dissemination, which is highly desirable to let the public
know when someone takes a position. But the incident certainly
shows that can be taken advantage of by someone.''
   General Cinema, based in Chestnut Hill, received a brown manila
envelope with no return address and a New Jersey postmark late
Thursday morning.
   Inside was a copy of a letter to the SEC from a Kile Johnasen of
15 Apple St., London, and a copy of a partial 13-D form, required
whenever an investor holds more than 5 percent of a stock. The man
said he used ``personal funds'' to acquire 2.8 million shares of
General Cinema worth about $61 million.
   But London directory information showed no one named Johnasen,
and London police told the company there is no Apple Street in the
city, General Cinema spokesman Peter Farwell said.
   ``We thought it was hoax when it arrived here,'' he said. ``The
copy that was made, the fact that it wasn't a completed 13-D, made
us feel it was a hoax.''
   But shortly after 2 p.m. Thursday, the Dow Jones News Service
carried the report of the filing with the SEC in Washington on its
financial wires. Before the company could react, the stock, which
opened at $20.87{ a share, rose to a high of $23.25 before closing
at $21.75. The stock was unchanged Friday.
   ``It's a serious matter,'' Farwell said. ``People are making
investment decisions. You want them made on accurate information.''
   SEC filings are not reviewed before being made public. Balancing
the need to ensure the authenticity of the SEC's 70,000 annual
filings with the public's right to quickly learn about major stock
acquisitions is difficult, securities experts said.
   ``When a messenger walks in with a filing, how do you know the
messenger didn't print it up in his basement?'' said Ira Lee
Sorkin, a former SEC regional administrator now working as a
white-collar crime and securities lawyer in New York.
   ``Filings occur all the time,'' he said. ``How do you check each
one? It's a very difficult process.''
   Sorkin said false filings are ``not uncommon,'' but typically
involve misrepresentation of facts and not outright fiction. Form
13-D filings sometimes are the first sign of a takeover bid and can
influence stock trading heavily.
   SEC spokesman Chiles Larson said the commission was examining
the General Cinema filing.
   ``If a filing comes in to the commission it's received by a
clerk through the mail,'' Larson said. ``Clerks are not really
securities analysts. The commission holds all respondents
responsible for the accuracy.''
   New York Stock Exchange spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said General
Cinema had asked the exchange to review the incident ``and we'll
certainly cooperate.''
   Miller, the securities lawyer, called on the SEC to review its
guidelines and impose safeguards.
   ``I think the SEC and the securities bar should think hard about
how safeguards could be implemented without impeding the speed and
efficiency of the system,'' he said. ``In retrospect we're
fortunate this hasn't happened more often.''
   The stock price jump was considered unusual because General
Cinema chairman Richard Smith owns about 30 percent of the
company's stock, including virtually all of its Class B stock, both
of which are needed to approve any change in control.
   ``I think the bizarrest part was that the market reacted to
it,'' said Harry E. Wells, an analyst with Adams Harkness & Hill.
``Dick Smith has total control of the company. The odds are
somewhere between slim and none that he would ever sell. A 13-D
with General Cinema means absolutely zip. Why the market went up a
point is beyond me.''
   General Cinema also owns Neiman-Marcus department stores and
acquired an 18.4 percent interest in Cadbury Schweppes PLC of
London earlier this year.

   The dollar rose broadly against major currencies
Friday in anticipation of higher interest rates and continued
strong economic growth and despite central bank intervention.
   Gold prices also rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
gold at a bid of $436 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from
$432.75 late Thursday.
   Analysts said the dollar reached its highs for the week against
some currencies, after falling in early trading as central banks
intervened to suppress its rise.
   ``For awhile it was working. Then the Fed and other central
banks stepped away for some reason and the dollar bounced right
back up,'' said Garrett Glass, vice president of First Capital
Corp. of Chicago.
   Dealers here and in Frankfurt said repeated dollar sales by the
Federal Reserve and the central banks of West Germany, Switzerland,
Italy and the Netherlands could not contain the U.S. currency's
strength.
   Dollar buying has persisted in recent days on the assumption
that interest rates are heading higher and that economic growth is
continuing strong, analysts said.
   Interest rates in the financial markets rose earlier this week
on speculation that the Fed was moving to tighten credit to stem a
rise in inflation. Higher interest rates increase the value of
dollar-denominated investments.
   The dollar was bolstered because ``all the signs point to a
higher interest rate environment'' in the United States, according
to Marek Stefamovicz, a corporate advisor at Nomura Bank
International.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to a closing 132.53 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.05 yen. In New York, the
dollar rose to 133.145 yen from 132.55 yen late Thursday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7105, down from
$1.7225 Thursday. In New York, the pound fell to $1.7090 from late
Thursday's $1.7215.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late
Thursday, included: 1.87985 West German marks, up from 1.86615;
1.56325 Swiss francs, up from 1.5505; 6.3355 French francs, up from
6.2875; 1,384.50 Italian lire, up from 1,377.75; and 1.21055
Canadian dollars, up from 1.20785.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with rates late
Thursday, included: 1.8750 West German marks, up from 1.8645;
1.5615 Swiss francs, up from 1.5505; 6.3202 French francs, up from
6.2885; 2.1185 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0920; 1,377.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,370.50; 1.2105 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2086.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery
closed at $436.10 a troy ounce, up from $432.50 late Thursday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $435.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $433. In Zurich, gold rose to $436.50
an ounce compared with $432.50 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $434.48 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's closing bid of $433.78.
   Silver for August delivery finished at $6.807 a troy ounce on
New York's Comex, up from $6.707 late Thursday. Silver was quoted
earlier in London at a bid price of $6.81 a troy ounce, up from
Thursday's $6.79.

   The stock market climbed sharply Friday in a
robust rally that surprised traders and lured institutional
investors from the sidelines.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed at 2,128.73, up
46.40 points in its largest one-day advance since June 8, when the
index rose 48.36. The Dow average's gain on the week totaled 67.74
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 15 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,178 issues up, 329 down and 470 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 192.34 million shares,
up from 154.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
217.91 million shares.
   The market's advance steadily gained momentum and breadth
throughout the session, peppered with computer-triggered buying
activity.
   The Dow average's push above the 2,100 level at midday helped
lure money from the institutional investors who had been reluctant
to participate.
   The rally ``took most traders by surprise,'' said Hugh Johnson,
senior vice president at First Albany Corp., noting that many had
expected ``it would be a typical summer day.''
   Pointing to volume higher than the anemic levels seen earlier in
the week as well as broad overall increases in stock prices,
Johnson said the rally was ``healthier than (those) we've seen
recently.''
   The Dow average climbed more than 28 points in the previous
session, but the advance mostly was confined to blue chip and
technology issues.
   ``This was encouraging market behavior (that) suggests we could
break out of the malaise,'' Johnson said.
   Analysts attributed the advance to fresh strength in the dollar
and continued favorable reaction to comments by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who indicated Thursday that the Fed hasn't
changed credit policy recently.
   The comments served to ``quiet some fears that have been
reflected in bond prices,'' Johnson said.
   With the spotlight off interest rates, investors were able to
turn attention to the positive corporate earnings reports pouring
in over the past few weeks. Investors had been reluctant to react
to the favorable reports for fear that higher interest rates would
dilute corporate profits down the road.
   Analysts were optimistic that the market could build on gains in
the coming week. ``I love to see a rally on a Friday in the summer,
because a lot of people aren't here to participate, and hopefully
the decision makers will come back Monday and further the rally,''
said Philip Puccio, a senior vice president at Dillon, Read & Co.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, IBM rose 2 to 125}.
Chevron, which said it would realign certain departments in its
domestic oil and gas subsidiary, rose 2 to 48{.
   Macmillan was up ~ at 84|. The publisher said it was exploring
options after rejecting a $75-a-share bid from the Robert M. Bass
Group.
   Union Carbide, which withdrew a planned offering of 15 million
common shares, rose 1~ to 23]. Eastman Kodak gained ~ at 45| amid
rumors the company may sell its household products division for as
much as $2 billion.
   Public Service of New Mexico, down [ at 14~, was the most active
issue with nearly 23 million shares changing hands as traders moved
to capture the utility's quarterly dividend.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $47.7 billion, or 1.80
percent, in value.
   The NYSE index climbed 2.95 to 153.35.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials gained 6.68 to
313.98, and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 6.00 at 272.02.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.55
to 306.18. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 387.33, up 3.25.

<HEAD>Tokyo's Rollercoaster Stock Market Spooks U.S. Traders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock dealers have been faced for some time with
an emotional dilemma over the Japanese equities market _ envy and
fear.
   Riding Japan's post-war economic boom, the Tokyo market soared
both before and after October's bloody stock market collapse. While
traders here might be green with envy over that market's stellar
performance, many maintain that a crack is inevitable.
   The Tokyo market's recent volatility has only served to heighten
concerns that trace back more than a year.
   ``It's like dealing with Las Vegas,'' said one trader in New
York. ``There's a great amount of paranoia. We know it's going to
crack, we just don't know when.''
   During the week ended July 22, the key Nikkei 225-share index
suffered its biggest single-day drop ever and a net loss of 590
points for the week. The Tokyo market recouped in the past week,
with the Nikkei index gaining a net 610 points despite signals that
Japanese economic growth might be flagging.
   The Japanese government reported that its index of leading
indicators measured 40 in May, the first time in 17 months the
index sank below 50, which is considered the base number indicating
an expanding economy.
   Stan Weinstein, editor and publisher of the Professional Tape
Reader newsletter in Hollywood, Fla., sees fissures in Japan's
stock market irrespective of what's going on the economy.
   Among those problems are a technical weakening of certain issues
and the psychological inability among investors to acknowlege any
downside potential, both of which could spark a ``serious''
downward move within the next 18 months, Weinstein said.
   The Nikkei index plowed beyond its pre-crash high even after
shell-shocked foreigners sold some $21 billion in Japanese
securities in October and November last year.
   Although the broader Japanese market has not advanced as
impressively as the Nikkei, ``nobody can concede it will go down,''
Weinstein said. ``Some are talking about 35,000'' in the Nikkei
index, which closed the week at the 27,900 level, he said.
   Indeed, Hideo Karino, general manager of foreign stock trading
at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., said the Tokyo market
``is going into a golden age _ it's going to be the `nifty '90s,'''
he said, predicting further advances for at least three or four
more years.
   Here at home, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
traded as high as 2,722 last August, finished the week up 67.74 at
2,128.73.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 3.80 to
153.35; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
fell 0.02 to 387.33, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index edged up 0.07 to 306.18.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 163.98 million shares a day,
against 150.13 million the week before.
   Karino explained that Japanese fund managers, who are faced with
low interest rates at home, have little choice but to invest in
equities. Wall Street, he says in contrast, ``is in a recession
because most investors would like to keep their money in cash.''
   American traders complain bitterly that the Japanese market is
``rigged,'' since large corporations typically own big stakes in
each other that they do not sell. In addition, they say that
Japanese government involvement in the market would preclude any
sharp downward spike.
   ``They have a vested interest in trying to kite the market
higher,'' Weinstein said. ``But there always comes a point where
enough is enough, and Japan is reaching that point.''
   Some have criticized the Japanese market as being driven by
rumors, while traders in the United States are more apt to take a
formalized, technical approach stocks, buying and selling based on
company performances and fundamental economic data.
   ``Perhaps we're a little wiser,'' Weinstein said. ``We've seen
1929 and know what happens after that.''
   In the short term, however, a selloff in Japan can be positive
for domestic markets. Japanese investors who dump stocks in Tokyo
are likely to put that money into U.S. stocks and bonds.
   American traders probably are overreacting when they point to
Japan as the epicenter of the next international economic cataclysm.
   ``But on the other side, the Japanese are just so complacent
about their market _ they think it can continue to go up, so it's
like these two investor classes are living in two totally different
worlds,'' one analyst said.
   Experts say the Japanese market is characterized by two extremes
_ foreigners who fear they are about to fall through a trap door,
and Japanese who think it can go on forever.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Soar Their Limits; Commodities Advance
Broadly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and sobyean futures scored their first major advance in
more than two weeks Friday and many other commodity markets
followed suit, reversing a trend of generally falling prices.
   But a surprising government report showing the nation's cattle
herd to be larger than many experts had predicted was expected to
bring a sharp drop in cattle futures prices next week.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed Friday ahead of that
report.
   On other exchanges, sugar, coffee and precious metals futures
all rebounded; stock-interest futures advanced sharply; and most
energy futures gained.
   A basketful of bullish factors sparked a buying binge in grain
and soybean pits of the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``Mr. Excitement jumped in here today,'' said Jerry Gidel, an
analyst with G.H. Miller & Co. in Chicago.
   Most corn and soybean futures soared their respective daily
limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel while the limitless August
soybean contract gained more than 34 cents.
   An overnight increase in cash corn prices spurred some
hedge-type buying of corn futures by commerical grain dealers and
processors, analysts said.
   A rumor later in the day that the Soviet Union was in the market
for corn prompted further buying of corn futures.
   The depressed soybean market attracted bargain hunters early in
the session. Then meatpacker Conagra Inc. released a prediction
that this year's U.S. soybean production would total 1.56 billion
bushels, compared to the Agriculture Department's latest estimate
of 1.65 billion bushels, which added further support to the soybean
market, Gidel said.
   Wheat prices advanced on news of new export sales and on the
USDA's decision not to reduce from the current 10 percent the
portion of their acreage that wheat growers must set aside to
qualify for federal price supports.
   ``There had been a lot of talk of it going down to 5 percent, so
that got the wheat market off to a good start,'' Gidel said.
   Private weather forecasts reducing the prospects for rain this
weekend in the drought-stricken Farm Belt lent strength across the
board, analysts said.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued several
forecasts predicting warm and dry conditions in the Midwest next
weekend, a mixed precipitation picture in the Farm Belt during
August and above-normal rainfall in the region in September and
October.
   Wheat settled 10 cents to 18 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.68\ a bushel; corn was 6\ cents to 10
cents higher with September at $2.75 a bushel; oats were 7 cents to
the limit 15 cents higher with September at $2.71{ a bushel;
soybeans were 9 cents to 34{ cents higher with August at $7.76 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the USDA's semi-annual cattle
inventory report, which was widely expected to show about a 2
percent reduction from a year ago in the nation's cattle herd.
   But the report showed the cattle herd to be down only 1 percent,
at 107.9 million head, basically because of a 1988 calf crop that
was larger than expected.
   Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington
Heights, Ill., said the estimated calf crop of 40.2 million head
indicated the bovine birth rate during the first half of the year
was the third-highest in the past 17 years.
   ``That's where the biggest part of the surprise came in,'' he
said.
   Prices of cattle for delivery next year have generally been
rising on the assumption that this year's drought will cut into
next year's cattle supply.
   But analysts predicted prices of 1989 cattle futures would
plunge on Monday because of the large calf number.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .55 cent higher with August at
66.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with August at 79.45 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent lower
to .60 cent higher with August at 43.87 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .43 cent lower to .65 cent higher with August at 30.52
cents a pound.
   Sugar and coffee futures rebounded from three days of sharp
declines in mostly technical buying on New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange.
   September coffee settled .93 cent higher at $1.2472 a pound;
October sugar was .72 cent higher at 11.54 cents a pound.
   The inflationary implications of rising commodity prices,
combined with a drop in Treasury bond interest rates gave precious
metals futures a boost on New York's Commodity Exchange, analysts
said.
   Gold settled $3.50 to $4.10 higher with August at $436.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 9.5 cents to 10.2 cents higher with September at
$6.855 a troy ounce.
   The decline in interest rates also helped trigger a sharp rise
in stock-index futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where
the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 6.40 points higher at 273.25.
   Energy futures prices made slight gains on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in light trading dominated mostly by technical
factors.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 16 cents to 21 cents
higher with September at $16.31 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent
to .40 cent higher with August at 44.66 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .21 cent lower to .87 cent higher with August at 51.74
cents a gallon.

<HEAD>China Buys Another 400,000 Tons of Subsidized U.S. Wheat</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought an additional 400,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the Agriculture Department
said Thursday.
   The sales, equal to about 14.7 million bushels, were handled by
two companies: Cargill Inc., 200,000 tons; and Ferruzzi USA Inc.,
200,000 tons.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the sales were part of an
authorzed 2 million tons of wheat announced April 5 under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, and some left over from an
earlier authorization.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent wheat prices at farm points have averaged around $3.46 per
bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $50 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Prior to the new authorization on April 5, China had bought 4.9
million tons of wheat under EEP subsidy arrangements. Sims said
China has 610,000 tons still available for use.
   Under the program, exporters can sell U.S. commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonuses due the four companies averaged $9.84 per
ton of wheat, or about 27 cents a bushel. The bonuses will be paid
in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose Friday, bolstered by the
dollar's resilient rise against other major currencies.
   The gains were greatest in longer-term issues. The Treasury's
closely watched 30-year bond rose about ] point, or $3.75 for every
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price
and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, dropped to 9.21
percent from 9.26 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said bond prices got a lift from the advancing dollar,
which defied the efforts of some central banks to drive the U.S.
currency lower by selling dollars in the open market. The dollar
rose to 133.14 Japanese yen in late trading in New York from 132.55
yen late Thursday.
   ``I think you had to be impressed,'' said Marilyn Cohen,
president of Capital Insight, an investment firm in Beverly Hills,
Calif. ``This was a very good day for the bond market.''
   A falling dollar, on the other hand, tends to erode the value of
dollar-denominated investments such as Treasury bonds.
   Bond values also drew support, analysts said, from indications
by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the central bank
was not changing its credit policy.
   ``Reserve data shows the Fed has not really tightened (credit)
and that was confirmed by Greenspan,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief
economist at Norwest Corp., a bank holding company in Minneapolis.
The Fed chairman testified before a congressional committee
Thursday.
   Tighter monetary policy tends to push interest rates up, driving
bond prices lower.
   Earlier this week, bond prices fell as interest rates rose amid
speculation the Fed was tightening credit to restrain rising
inflation, which devalues fixed-income securities such as bonds and
notes.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues gained 1-16 point to [ point, intermediate
maturities rose 5-32 point to 9-32 point, and 20-year issues
advanced about ] point, according to figures provided by Telerate
Inc., a business information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, rose 2.08 to 1,136.72.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, edged up 0.34 to 282.17.
   Three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, declined 3 basis points
to a discounted rate of 6.94 percent and a yield of 7.15 percent.
Six-month bills slipped 1 basis point to a discounted rate of 7.12
percent and a yield of 7.48 percent, while one-year bills fell 6
basis points to 7.33 percent to yield 7.86 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7 13-16 percent, unchanged
from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Stocks, Bonds, Dollar, Farm Prices All Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Stocks and bonds strengthened sharply Friday in rallies stemming
partly from the dollar's appreciation against foreign currencies,
counteracting fear of higher inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 46.40 points
to 2,128.73, the largest one-day advance since a 48.36-point gain
June 8. Broader market barometers also rose strongly.
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy, the
Treasury's key 30-year issue rose more than $3 per $1,000 face
amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 9.21
percent from 9.26 percent late Thursday.
   Market economists attributed part of the advances to a jump in
the dollar's value in foreign exchange trading, which increases
overseas demand for securities denominated in dollars and lessens
the prospect of sharply higher domestic inflation, a constant
source of concern to investors.
   The U.S. currency gained more than a West German pfennig to
1.87985 marks and nearly a half Japanese yen to 133.145 yen. The
gains came despite central-bank dollar selling to slow its
appreciating value.
   In other economic news Friday, the Agriculture Department said
the prices farmers received for raw products this month rose 3.6
percent from June, reflecting the drought's devastating effect on
crop and livestock production.
   The department's said higher prices for corn, soybeans and eggs
contributed most to the July increase. Lower prices for oranges,
cattle and hogs partly offset the rise in other commodities.
   Department projections earlier this month showed 1988 grain
production may be reduced by 24 percent from last year. Heat and
drought have dried pastures and forced producers to thin herds to
cut down on rising feed costs.

<TEXT>
   Television is teaching Britons to love the once
little-known sport of football, and American sporting goods
companies are cashing in on a craze for everything from uniforms to
T-shirts, badges and fluffy toys bearing NFL team logos.
   ``The market here is a six-year-old market,'' said Andrew
Maconie, whose company, Licensing Management International, handles
licensing, publishing and marketing for the National Football
League in Britain. ``It was created with television.''
   Britain's Channel 4 television began broadcasting weekly
highlights of NFL games in 1982, calling the program ``American
Football'' to distinguish it from soccer, called simply
``football'' here. Audiences have tripled to around 3 million
viewers each week, the TV station's studies say.
   Many British fans have gone beyond armchair-quarterbacking. More
than 100 teams have sprung up in the country, a league has been
formed sponsored by Budweiser beer, and several magazines dedicated
to the imported sport are being published.
   As the game has caught on, sales of American football
paraphernalia have taken off.
   Last year, Maconie sold more than $43 million worth of
NFL-licensed products, a 15 percent increase over the previous
year. He expects a similar climb this year.
   ``We started with zero in 1982, so we've obviously had some very
dramatic growth,'' said Maconie, who worked to put football on TV
here.
   The growth has attracted some of the top names in American
sporting goods to Britain. They have been helped by the U.S.
Embassy, which staged an ``American Football Equipment Exhibition''
to coincide with a pre-season NFL game Sunday at London's Wembley
Stadium between the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers, dubbed
``The American Bowl.''
   The British market for football items ``is here to stay, there's
no question about that,'' said Tom Knight, general manager of All
American Import Co., which distributes products made by St.
Louis-based Rawlings Sporting Goods.
   Standing at his booth decorated with samples of team shirts,
footballs and shoulderpads, Knight said sales of playing equipment
have leveled off as the sport has become more established.
   But, he said, sales of souvenir-type items, especially to
youngsters, ``is a side of the business which has been very big.''
   ``They, having seen their fathers and big brothers play, now
want to play themselves. That market can develop well,'' Knight
said.
   Chris Bye, an official with the Thames Valley Chargers, a team
in the Budweiser league, was hoping to find a good deal on helmets
at the trade fair.
   ``Each player takes 300 pounds (about $500) or more to kit each
year,'' he said. ``You have a squad of 50 players, that's a lot of
money.''
   Bye added that he was hoping to find higher quality goods for
his team.
   ``I believe that the existing stuff marketed to the general
public in England at the moment isn't of high enough quality,'' Bye
said. ``The stuff in the States is very good. We could sell some of
that over here.''
   Teddy Craze, whose Fast Lane Sports distributes for Champion
Products of Rochester, N.Y., says his sales of uniforms and various
NFL-licensed items have gone up by 300 percent in one year.
   ``There's really a good hard core'' of fans hungry for
American-made football goods, he said, ``and this is really
developing very strongly.''
   Another British firm, Woolgrove American Imports, recently began
distributing products made by Wilson Sporting Goods of River Grove,
Ill.
   Product manager Doug Proctor, his sales booth crammed with
Wilson footballs and other football paraphernalia, agreed that the
televised NFL highlights created a market that did not exist before.
   He said the NFL pre-season contests staged at Wembley the past
three summers also have sparked a lot of interest _ and sales.
   ``I think it's probably the best marketing system we have, in
fact, to have the top teams coming over here and showing how the
game is properly played,'' Proctor said. ``And it's a big spinoff
in the market.''

<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Singer Co. announced Friday it has
agreed to sell its American Meter Division to Ruhrgas AG of Essen,
West Germany, for about $132 million.
   American Meter is a leading supplier of residential gas meters
to the United States gas utilities and also produces and markets
gas metering-regulating equipment for industrial and commerical
applications. It is headquartered in Philadelphia.
   Ruhrgas is the world's largest importer of natural gas and the
largest gas company in West Germany.
   The sale is part of Singer's previously announced divestment
program. Under that program, the company has now reached seven
sales agreements with a total value of about $1.7 billion.
   Paul A. Bilzerian, chairman and chief executive officer of
Singer, said the latest agreement is favorable for both Ruhrgas and
American Meter.
   ``Ruhrgas will acquire a business that has a long and
distinguished history of innovation and customer service in the
field,'' Bilzerian said. ``American Meter's potential for future
growth, in turn, will be enhanced as it becomes part of an
organization with other major committments in the industry.''
   Singer and Ruhrgas said they expect to complete the transaction
shortly.

<HEAD>GSA Pushes Back Deadline For New Federal Phone System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Services Administration said
Friday it has pushed back its deadline for awarding bids for an
all-new federal telephone system known as FTS 2000.
   In a brief statement, the GSA said award of the contracts,
scheduled for Sept. 30, has been delayed until the end of the year.
   Contracts on the FTS 2000 system, worth as much as $25 billion
over 10 years, were originally scheduled to have been awarded by
the end of 1987. However, that date slipped when the GSA, under
pressure from Congress, decided to split the contract, with 60
percent going to one vendor and 40 percent to another.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has joined with the Boeing
Corp. to compete against a team consisting of US Sprint
Communications Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp.
   The GSA the latest delay was being made ``to make available
additional time for evaluating the large amount of technical and
financial bid data.''
   AT&T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company was ``very
disturbed'' by the delay.
   ``AT&T has expended significant resources to meet requests from
the GSA for information so that the agency could make good on its
commitment to meet the Sept. 30 deadline for awarding the
contract,'' he said.

<HEAD>Boeing Announces Aircraft Orders Estimated At Up To $790 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. announced Thursday it had received
orders for 12 commercial jets, with a total value estimated at up
to $790 million, from a Canadian and an Australian airline.
   In addition, Rolls-Royce said Thursday that an Australian
leasing group, Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services, had converted
options on six Rolls-Royce powered Boeing 757 aircraft into firm
orders. But Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said the Seattle aerospace
company had not been able to confirm that deal yet with Ansett.
   If the Ansett order goes through, it would give Boeing its
fourth straight record year in dollar value for commercial jet
orders. Ansett had taken the options in October when it placed a
firm order for six 757s.
   Canadian Airlines International Ltd. on Thursday ordered three
747-400s and took options for three more, while Australian Airlines
ordered nine 737-400s with options for five more.
   Neither airline announced the values of their orders. But Cole
said a 747-400 sells for $115 million to $130 million, and the
smaller 737-400 for $29 million to $33 million. The orders also
include provisions for training and spare parts, which Cole said
usually boost the cost by 15 percent.
   At those prices, the Canadian Airlines' order would be worth
between $396.8 million and $448.5 million, and Australian's order
would be for $300.2 million to $341.6 million.
   So far this year, Boeing has had orders for 438 jet aircraft
worth about $19.75 billion. That compares with last year's 366 jets
worth $19.9 billion, a record for dollar value. The record for
number of jets ordered is 461 in 1978.
   Canadian Airlines is to receive its new jets from late 1990
through March 1991. It said in a news release that it will use the
new jets on Pacific routes, such as Toronto-Tokyo and
Vancouver-Hong Kong.
   The 747-400, which made its first flight last spring and is to
be delivered to its initial customer before the end of the year,
can carry up to 660 passengers, but will normally carry up to 412
to achieve an 8,200-mile range. Boeing has had 149 orders for
747-400s, and 873 orders for all versions of 747s.
   The 737-400, a stretch version of the twinjet, will seat 139 in
Australian's configuration and have a range of about 2,500 miles.
The airline is to receive the planes in 1990 and 1991.
   Australian Chairman A.E. Harris said it plans to use the planes
to start replacing its Boeing 727-200 aircraft, which it began
operating in 1970.
   Boeing has 125 orders for 737-400s. There have been more than
2,150 orders for all 737 models.

   Revco D.S. Inc., a giant drugstore chain,
has filed for bankruptcy protection, a month after missing a $46
million interest payment to bondholders, officials disclosed.
   Revco Chairman Boake A. Sells said Thursday the stage was set
for the reorganization filing when Revco failed to pay the interest
on $400 million in junk bonds June 15. Bondholders were demanding
payment of the principal as well as the interest.
   Revco issued the bonds to finance its $1.5 billion leveraged
buyout in late 1986. When it missed the interest payment, the Revco
buyout became the largest leveraged buyout to fail.

   The U.S. Postal Service began a 16-month,
$700,000 quest to lick the problem of stamps that don't stay stuck,
urging industry to produce an adhesive to serve as a ``seat belt
for a stamp.''
   Gordon C. Morison, a senior assistant postmaster general, made

   Prime Computer Inc. said Thursday its
second-quarter earnings fell 54.1 percent despite a 73 percent
revenue rise.
   Prime said it earned $7.2 million, or 15 cents a share, in the
three months ended July 4 compared with a profit of $15.7 million,
or 32 cents a share, a year ago.
   The company reported revenues of $408.4 million for the quarter,
up from $236 million a year earlier.
   The latest results include a onetime charge of $5.1 million
after taxes for the previously-disclosed withdrawal of its
mini-supercomputer from the market.
   The 1987 figures do not include results of Computervision Inc.,
which merged with Prime in February.
   On Monday, Prime pulled its MXCL5 mini-supercomputer from the
marketplace, citing competitive pricing and a slumping market for
the action.
   In a statement, Prime President Joe M. Henson said the company
met its earnings and revenue expectations despite the charge on the
MXCL5.
   ``We're pleased that in the midst of a difficult industry
environment and our integration with Computervision, we were able
to meet our revenue and expense goals for the quarter,'' Henson
said.
   For the first six months of the year, Prime said it earned $21.7
million, or 45 cents a share, down from $27.6 million, or 56 cents
a share, a year ago.
   Six-month revenue rose to $772 million from $458 million in 1987.
