<HEAD>Government Authorizes La Prensa to Reopen, Suspends Radio News
Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Ministry authorized the
opposition newspaper La Prensa to resume publishing Wednesday
following a 15-day suspension imposed for reporting violence at an
anti-government protest.
   But a statement released Tuesday by the ministry said La
Prensa's directors at a meeting with government officials ``were
admonished for constant disrespect for the laws of the nation.''
   Also Tuesday, the ministry suspended for 48 hours the radio news
program El Nicaraguense. It accused the program directors of
broadcasting ``false news'' but did not elaborate. The program is
broadcast by the privately owned station Radio Mundial.
   The left-wing Sandinista government ordered the suspension of La
Prensa on July 12, one day after the newspaper reported a violent
police crackdown at a July 10 demonstration in the southern city of
Nandaime.
   More than three dozen opposition leaders were detained by police
during the demonstration.
   In ordering the shutdown, the government accused La Prensa of
``flagrant abuse of the freedom of expression to the detriment of
the public order and the interests of the people.''
   Also on July 12 the government ordered an indefinite suspension
of Radio Catolica, the station operated by the Nicaraguan Roman
Catholic church, for its reporting of the Nandaime demonstration.
   Cristiana Chamorro Barrios, deputy director of La Prensa, told
The Associated Press Tuesday night the newspaper rejected the
Interior Ministry's claims it had violated laws.
   She said Wednesday's editions would include a special section
covering events that occurred during the suspension.

   They said 19 people perished in highway accidents Sunday
compared to 25 deaths on the corresponding day last year.
   The regulations went into effect Sunday and reduced speed limits
from 87 mph to 68 mph on major highways and from 68 mph to 56 on
secondary roads.
   Public Works Minister Enrico Ferri anounced the lower limits
last week following a weekend in which 95 people were killed in
highway accidents. The limits are to be in force until Sept. 11.
   Police said 6,000 speeding tickets were issued Sunday.

   Former astronaut Alan B. Shepard has
announced plans for a U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame that he hopes
will offer a look at the heavens from an astronaut's perspective.
   Shepard, the first American to fly in space, said the museum
will feature personal mementos of America's seven original Mercury
spacemen and will be displayed in complex to be built near this
spaceport.
   The Hall of Fame ``will explain space travel from the
astronauts' point of view'' with photographs, displays of training
equipment, personal log books, clothing and souvenirs of the
nation's first corps of astronauts, Shepard said Monday.
   He said the attraction, to be opened in 1990, will share an
18-acre complex with the U.S. Space Camp of Florida and a 200-room
hotel located in Titusville, just outside the gates of the Kennedy
Space Center.
   Besides Shepard, the Mercury astronauts, named in 1959, were
Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally
Schirra and Deke Slayton.
   Grissom, as a member of the Apollo 1 crew, died in a launch pad
fire in 1967. The others are active in the Mercury Seven
Foundation, which operates the Florida Space Camp and funds college
scholarships in science and technology.

   It's hardly a big fish story but two

   A critical test-firing of space
shuttle Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad has been
put off 24 hours, until Sunday, to give crews more time to seal the
engine compartment.
   A practice countdown, the first of two leading to the firing,
was halted Monday when the launch team decided it could not close
out the compartment work in time to conduct the test on Saturday as
intended.
   The postponement was announced as engineers assessed two major
candidates for fixing a small shuttle gas leak without having to
take Discovery off the launch pad, a move that could delay the
planned early September launch by as much as two months.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials believe
that even if the leak can be fixed on the pad, the launch will be
delayed past the middle of September.
   The two most promising approaches for reaching the inaccessible
leak for a launch pad fix are:
   _Cutting a hole through the rear wall of the shuttle cargo bay
and clamping a clamshell-shaped device over the leak, filling it
with a sealant.
   _Running a flexible tube topped by a badminton-like shuttlecock
through the 20-foot gas line, filling in the area behind the
shuttlecock with a sealant.
   Tests of both systems have been promising, NASA officials said.
Shuttle managers were scheduled to meet again Thursday to consider
the latest test findings.

<HEAD>Fraud, Abuse Increase with Number of Financial Planners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The explosion in the number of financial
planners in the 1980s has been matched by a surge in fraud and
abuse, state securities regulators told Congress today.
   The North American Securities Administrators Association, in a
report to the Senate Banking subcommittee on consumer affairs, said
losses to fraud and abuse totaled $397 million between mid-1986 and
mid-1988.
   The losses were suffered by 22,100 investors in 79 separate
cases pursued by officials in 30 states.
   That compares with $91 million lost in 31 cases between mid-1983
and mid-1985, the association said.
   ``The absence of effective national oversight of the financial
planning industry has created an enormous opportunity for con
artists and ... (others) who have few scruples about how they earn
their living,'' the association said.
   The group, which represents regulators in all 50 states, said an
``alarming rise'' in large swindles contributed to the increase. It
also said more aggressive enforcement probably led to more cases
being uncovered.
   ``Most disturbing is that we are seeing a substantial surge in
the number of `big ticket' cases with investor losses in the
eight-figure range,'' said James C. Meyer, Tennessee's top
securities regulator and president of the association.
   A 1985 association survey turned up only one case where
investors lost more than $10 million, while the latest check found
five cases where losses totaled more than $30 million.
   With the proliferation of investment options in recent years,
millions of Americans have turned to financial planners for advice
on saving for retirement, college education or buying a house.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies
offering advice concerning securities to register as investment
advisers. But, in contrast to stock brokers, who are required to
pass an exam, there are no educational standards.
   Also, financial planners offering advice that does not involve
buying securities do not have to register. Neither do lawyers and
accountants whose advice is incidental to their work. And,
individuals can work for a registered planner without registering
themselves.
   Another contentious issue is how financial planners, who are
supposed to offer independent advice, are paid. Some work only for
fees paid by their customers. But, according to an SEC study in
February, 85 percent are compensated at least in part through
commissions on what they sell.
   In May, the SEC censured and suspended a New Mexico firm for
failing to disclose it received commissions for the securities it
recommended.
   The International Financial Planning Association, based in
Atlanta, says its membership has tripled from the end of 1982 to
about 25,000. It estimates there are as many as 150,000 financial
planners overall. About 13,000 firms have registered with the SEC
as investment advisers.
   Charles Finn, a financial planner in Hartford, Conn., and
chairman-elect of the association, said his group has been pushing
for more federal regulation, including the creation of a
self-regulatory organization similar to the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which oversees brokers who trade
over-the-counter stocks.
   ``We're talking here about rotten apples and my feeling is we
should get those rotten apples out of the barrel,'' he said. ``One
of the things I'm concerned about in this business is that somebody
can call himself a financial planner with impunity.''
   In a related matter, the SEC is scheduled to consider a rule
Thursday which would require investment advisers to keep records
for five years to back up performance claims made in their
advertising.
   The 30 states included in the most recent NASAA survey were:
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas,
Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   Connecticut, Oregon and Wisconsin were not included in the 1985
survey. Delaware, Michigan and Wyoming were part of the earlier
study, but not the 1988 survey.

<HEAD>Promotion of Blacks Lags in Navy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is studying why the promotion of
blacks in its ranks lags behind that of the other services, 40
years after President Harry S. Truman ordered the nation's military
to integrate.
   The Navy has launched an intensive two-month study to report to
Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Carlisle Trost on why the service
has so few black officers and why so many blacks are subject to
disciplinary action.
   The study was initiated at the suggestion of Vice Admiral L.A.
Edney, chief of naval personnel.
   ``Progress has slowed. We need to find out why,'' Edney said at
a convention of the mostly black Naval Officers' Association
earlier this month in Atlanta.
   The review coincides with the 40th anniversary today of Truman's
Executive Order 9981 for ``equality of treatment and opportunity
for all persons in the armed forces without regard to race, color,
religion or national origin.''
   The road has been slow, especially in the Navy. The number of
black officers in the Navy has grown from 254 in 1965 to 2,518
today. But that means that only 3.4 percent of the Navy's officers
are black, far behind the Army's rate of 10.3 percent, and the 6.6
percent in the military as a whole.
   In the Air Force, 5.4 percent of the officers are black, and in
the Marine Corps, 5.4 percent.
   The Navy goal is to reach 6 percent by 1996. That would be quite
a change for a service which declared as recently as 1933 that
blacks would be accepted only as mess stewards and which did not
name its first black admiral, Samuel L. Gravely Jr., until 1971,
according to the weekly Navy Times.
   Navy rolls now list six black admirals, two of them promoted
this year. The highest ranking black in the Navy is two-star Rear
Adm. Benjamin T. Hacker, commander of the Navy base and naval
training center at San Diego, a major port for the Pacific fleet.
   ``While we have experienced significant growth in numbers and
opportunities for minority personnel, we have clearly not met all
of our challenges,'' Edney said in his speech, given July 8.
   ``Despite our best efforts, the Navy still suffers from
shortages in minority officer accessions, officer promotions,
enlisted advancement and _ while lower than past years _ slightly
higher minority involvement with uniform code of military justice
violations,' he said.
   The Navy has ordered a separate report, due by the end of the
year, to determine why the court-martial rate for blacks last year
was 1.65 percent compared to 1.34 percent for all naval personnel.
   Within two months, a task force is to report to Edney and Trost
on ways to improve the promotion of blacks in the service.
   Edney proclaimed a commitment to ``keep equal opportunity on the
front burner as a top priority. It is the right thing to do. Equal
opportunity is fundamental to good leadership, morale and
discipline.''
   The white majority of Navy officers, he said, have ``a natural
tendency to be less sensitive to the perceptions and human needs of
minorities, be they minorities of race, religion or gender.''
   ``Top leaders must recognize this tendency and not tolerate such
insensitivity. We must have checks and balances to make sure the
chain of command is responsive,'' Edney said.
   The admiral promised that ``this will not be just another study
of equal opportunity programs. It will be a hard, introspective
look.''

<TEXT>
   Government biologists are discussing a 25
percent cutback in duck hunting seasons this fall, saying drought
has produced ``the worst habitat conditions'' biologists have ever
seen.
   Reduced hunting is one suggestion that advisory committees are
being asked to consider before the Fish and Wildlife Service holds
hearings early next month on guidelines for states to use in
adopting actual hunting regulations.
   Also put up for discussion, spokeswoman Megan Durham said
Monday, are a three-bird bag limit _ the typical recent limit has
been four _ and an early closing of the period when hunting is
permissible, Jan. 1 instead of Jan. 20.
   In other drought-related activity in Washington, President
Reagan wrote key members of agriculture committees in Congress on
Monday that some features of a bipartisan drought relief bill for
farmers might violate principles he believes should be followed.
   The president did not say specifically what troubled him, but
during a tour of drought-stricken corn and soybean producing areas
in southern Illinois earlier this month, Reagan voiced concern that
the relief package might take on the appearance of a ``Christmas
tree,'' in which lawmakers attach favored amendments on legislation
they know will pass the Congress.
   The advisory committees' discussion is beginning with a
prediction by the Fish and Wildlife Service that the fall duck
migration will total 66 million ducks, second lowest behind only
the 62 million of 1985.
   All the reduction from last year's 74 million will come in the
Mississippi and Central flyways. The migration on the Atlantic and
Pacific flyways is expected to be unchanged.
   The service has warned several times that hunting most likely
would have to be restricted this fall, not only because of this
year's drought but also because of drought throughout most of the
1980s in the marshy breeding areas of Canada and the northern
plains states.
   The early-season guidelines for blue-winged teal hunting in
September call for canceling the season outright in 13 states and
for major reductions elsewhere.
   Last week, the service released population counts showing the
breeding populations of 10 major duck species down 3.7 percent from
1987 and 17 percent below the long-term 1955-1987 average. The
Northern pintail duck is at a record low of 2.58 million, 18
percent fewer than in 1987 and 54 percent below average.
   ``Biologists are beginning to worry that continued low water
conditions in the areas waterfowl use for migration stopovers and
wintering will concentrate the birds and make them more vulnerable
to disease later this year,'' the service said in a survey of
drought problems as seen by its biologists around the country.
   There are fewer statistics on non-duck species, but the service
reported the Platte River in Nebraska has been turned into a
``river of sand,'' exposing the nesting piping plover and the
interior least tern to threats of predators and death of aquatic
food species.
   Pheasant, quail and grouse may not be affected until next
spring, when they'll have less cover during nesting season.
   Some other highlights from the survey:
   _Geese are faring better than ducks, since they nest on more
permanent wetlands and are better able to protect their young from
predators.
   _Federal hatcheries in South Carolina and Georgia report rising
water temperatures are increasing mortality of young trout and on
Monday, North Carolina state hatcheries were reported rushing
600,000 fish to the state's cooler streams a month earlier than
usual.
   _Fish and Wildlife Service biologists on the Great Lakes report
flows on tributaries are so low they cannot safely apply chemicals
to control lamprey, which prey on lake trout, and that dredging
necessitated by low water will spread contaminated bottom sediment,
threatening other aquatic life.
   _Without significant rain soon, a near-total failure of the
acorn crop from oak trees in the Midwest and South will occur,
spelling problems for deer, squirrels and wild turkey dependent on
acorns for food.
   _All 750 seedlings of the green pitcher plant, an endangered
species planted by the service in Alabama this spring, have been
killed.
   The duck population surveys recorded increases and in some cases
record numbers of ducks in northern Canada and Alaska. This means
they couldn't find suitable wetland areas further south, and may
not have the energy left to breed at all after their longer flights.
   Frank Dunkle, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said
last week he expects increased emphasis on habitat management. He
said marshland managed specifically for waterfowl has provided the
only relief for ducks and other species dependent on prairie
wetlands.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci says he
hopes to curb Pentagon purchasing abuses by ordering new limits on
the number of ``final offers'' that defense contractors can make on
a single deal.
   Carlucci said at a news conference Monday that he was surprised
to learn how frequently companies were allowed to revise supposedly
final bids, although he described it as ``the exception'' rather
than the rule.
   In the past, contractors have been allowed to amend their final
offers in consultation with the Pentagon to change prices or
technical specifications to meet military needs.
   The Pentagon has been rocked in recent weeks by allegations that
private consultants working for defense contractors bribed top
military purchasing officials for secret contract information.
   Many of the alleged abuses disclosed in the Justice Department
investigation involve contractors who, through the consultants,
learned the price or other specifics of bids by competing
companies, and then submitted a new ``best and final offer''
tailored to win contracts, some of them worth billions of dollars.
   ``It is the `best and final offer' that seems to us to create
the most intensive point in the competitive cycle. And that means
that information is at a premium,'' Carlucci said.
   ``We intend to continue with our competitive process. But when
you repeat it once, twice, or three times, then it can readily
become subject to abuse,'' Carlucci added.
   Carlucci, who was scheduled to testify before the House Armed
Services Committee today, also said his aides had drawn up a
``protocol'' for the military to follow as more information is
disclosed from the Justice Department investigation. Carlucci said
the department has:
   _Required that 17 companies implicated in the investigation
certify they did not engage in ``illegal or improper activity'' to
obtain a defense contract;
   _Required those 17 to agree, in any new contract greater than
$100,000, to include a clause allowing the government to recover
profits or 10 percent of the contract value if the deal is tainted;
   _Started procedures to lift the security clearances of six
people, including one suspended without pay from the Navy
Department and five others transferred to other duties pending
results of the investigation;
   _Sent letters to the top 200 defense contractors urging them to
implement strong internal ethics programs, ``stringent management
controls, and asking them to report back to us on their
self-governance programs;''
   _Reviewed federal acquisition regulations to tighten controls on
consultants employed by defense contractors;
   _Formed an audit task force to review the cost imposed on the
military budget by consultants employed by private defense
contractors.
   Carlucci said the certification requirement was being applied
only to the 17 implicated companies to avoid penalizing contractors
who were not under suspicion.
   ``This is a rifle action. It is not a shotgun action,'' he said.
``We are directing this at certain contractors. We do not intend to
apply it indiscriminately, because it does impose a burden on
people.
   ``And where there are burdens, there are costs, and those costs
may come back to the Pentagon and the U.S. taxpayer,'' he said.
``It is only where we have reason to believe that people are under
suspicion that we are doing this.''
   Carlucci declined to identify people whose security clearances
were being lifted, saying only that ``we are taking steps to revoke
the security clearances of individuals who have been involved in
illegal or improper actions.''
   In a related development, the White House announced that
President Reagan intends to nominate Milton L. Lohr to the new
position of deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition.
   Since 1983, Lohr has been president of the Defense Research
Corp. in La Jolla, Calif. Before that, he was executive vice
president of Flight Systems Inc., from 1969-83.
   Lohr, a 63-year-old native of Revere, Mass., graduated from the
University of Southern California in 1949 and the University of
California at Los Angeles in 1964.

   President Reagan is praising Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney at a time when Mulroney is encountering
opposition to a sweeping U.S.-Canadian free-trade pact.
   At the same time, Reagan had kind words Monday for a U.S.
Congress that often has come in for his criticism, saying lawmakers
had put the agreement ``on a fast track'' _ just as he asked.
   The setting for the president's remarks was a Roosevelt Room
ceremony at which Reagan signed letters transmitting to Congress
legislation to implement the agreement.
   ``Throughout North American history, whenever and wherever trade
barriers have been lowered, we've seen our economies bloom like
mountain meadows after a spring rain,'' the president said.
   ``This agreement is a sun rising on a new morning of economic
vitality,'' he said. ``It will save U.S. consumers up to $3 billion
a year. It will help keep the North American economy growing for a
generation to come.''
   On Jan. 2, Reagan and Mulroney signed an agreement that provides
for the elimination of all tariffs in the two countries' $150
billion-a-year trade. It also would reduce many non-tariff
barriers, liberalize investment practices and provide new rules
covering cross-border trade in services.
   Reagan did not allude to the political situation in Canada,
where Mulroney's Liberal Party opposition has threatened to stall
legislation implementing the accord there until Mulroney calls new
elections.
   But Reagan quoted his Canadian counterpart as saying, ``The
choice couldn't be more clear-cut _ the voices of the past against
a vision of the future.''
   ``I asked the Congress to put this on a fast track, which it
did, and then some,'' he said. (Auto racing driver) Rick Mears
couldn't have driven it any faster, which shows what we can do when
Democrats and Republicans work together.''
   The accord ran into trouble last week in Canada when the
opposition Liberal Party vowed to block ratification until Mulroney
calls a general election.
   But Mulroney, in a heated House of Commons exchange, rejected
demands for an immediate election to settle the free-trade issue _
a debate that has divided Canadians for a century.
   ``At an appropriate time, there will be an election,'' Mulroney
said last Wednesday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he did not believe
U.S. officials would comment ``on the internal affairs of Canada in
terms of their elections.''
   However, he said, ``we're still hopeful that they proceed with
the Free Trade Agreement and that they'll be able to get that
passed up there as well.''
   Fitzwater also said he hoped Canada would not amend or modify
the agreement. He said he did not know whether such a move would
require a renegotiation of the treaty.
   The Free Trade Agreement is scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1,
1989, provided Congress and the Canadian Parliament pass
implementing legislation. The changes will be phased in during a
10-year period.
   The House of Commons approved it in principle July 6 and has
scheduled a third and final reading in mid-August after committee
hearings. The legislation then goes to the Senate, which has a
large Liberal majority.
   Canada's two opposition parties, the Liberals and socialist New
Democrats, have accuse Mulroney of sacrificing the nation's
sovereignty. But Mulroney claims the deal will create prosperity
and shield Canada from U.S. protectionism.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz completed
his sixth year in office just a few days ago, and it's hard to
recall a time during that period when things looked better for him.
   East European nations are showing an increasing tendency to
diversify their diplomatic contacts, reflected in planned visits to
Washington this week by Hungarian Communist Party leader Karoly
Grosz and Poland's Foreign Minister Tadeusz Olechowski. Years have
passed since either of these Soviet allies sent high-level visitors
to Washington.
   In southwestern Africa, prospects have never seemed brighter for
the withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from Angola and
for Namibian independence from South African colonial rule.
   Pushed along by a U.S. mediation effort, South Africa, Cuba and
Angola have agreed to a statement of principle governing future
negotiations and are to meet next week to discuss a timetable for
the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the region.
   As Shultz sees it, the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola
will free the area of superpower competition for the first time
since the Cubans began arriving there in 1975. In addition, a South
African pullback from Namibia would create conditions for
independent rule in Africa's last colony.
   Perhaps the best news for Shultz lately is Iran's decision to
accept the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution
aimed at ending the 20th Century's longest major war.
   The administration has been working hard to encourage negotiated
settlements in both southwestern Africa and the Persian Gulf. And
administration officials in recent days have been feeling heady
about the progress in both areas.
   But it's difficult to say whether these gains are the result of
administration policy or just plain war weariness among the
combatants. The fighting in Angola dates back to the early 1960s;
the war in the gulf has claimed more than 1 million lives.
   Even Vietnam is showing a far friendlier face to the outside
world these days. Vietnamese forces have occupied neighboring
Cambodia for more than nine years, but Hanoi has promised to
withdraw 50,000 troops this year and the rest in two years.
   It also has demonstrated a far more forthcoming attitude toward
the United States on such issues as accounting for the nearly 2,400
American servicemen still listed as missing from the Vietnam War
and its treatment of former officials identified with the former
U.S.-backed regime in Saigon.
   An American team of technical experts is in Hanoi for
discussions on arrangements for joint on-site inspections to help
resolve the fate of the missing Americans.
   All this raises the possibility of eventual diplomatic ties with
Hanoi for the first time since North Vietnam became independent
more than 30 years ago. For now, however, the administration
refuses even to discuss that possibility, waiting instead for a
complete Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia and a satisfactory
accounting of MIA's.
   On at least two issues, Shultz is unable to claim progress. His
efforts to promote Arab-Israeli peace talks have not borne fruit.
In Nicaragua, although a fragile cease-fire remains in place, the
peace process is at an impasse and there is talk once again of
renewed American military aid to the Contras.
   Still, the world seems like a far less contentious place to
Shultz than it was at the time of the last presidential election.
In those days, Shultz was able to cite the U.S. victory over the
Grenadan Army as an achievement but not much else.
   That was before the rise of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
a time when Democrats were criticizing President Reagan for being
the first U.S. president in more than 50 years who had not met with
a Kremlin leader. That was four Soviet-American summits ago.

<HEAD>Political Debate Over Free Trade Has Parallel In 1911 Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX8</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   For the second time this century, political furor
over free trade with the United States could force a Canadian
government out of office.
   The precedent was set in 1911 when long-serving Liberal Prime
Minister Sir Wilfred Laurier proposed free trade but was pressured
into an early election and defeated by the Conservatives.
   The roles are reversed this time.
   A Conservative prime minister, Brian Mulroney, has negotiated
the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement with Washington, while the
Liberal opposition claims the deal will turn Canada into little
more than a resource base for the Americans.
   The agreement to dismantle duties and non-tariff barriers over a
10-year period is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. President Reagan
presented final legislation Monday to Congress and the Canadian
House of Commons is expected to approve the deal in August.
   In a bid to halt the ratification process, Liberal leader John
Turner played his final card last week. The Commons member asked
the Liberal-dominated Senate, an appointed chamber that can delay
and amend legislation, not to consider the bill until Mulroney
calls an election on the issue.
   Mulroney accused Turner of hijacking the authority of elected
members of Parliament _ meaning the Commons where Conservatives
hold 207 of the 282 seats. Turner's argument is that Mulroney has
no mandate for entering a treaty that radically changes the future
of Canada. In 1983, Mulroney spoke against free trade and the issue
was not part of the Conservative election platform in 1984.
   ``The agreement should not go into effect until the people of
Canada have had the opportunity to vote (on it),'' said Turner, who
maintains that such a pact would make Canada subservient to its
giant neighbor.
   He urged Mulroney to call a September election, one year before
his five-year term expires. That would provide enough time to
implement the agreement if voters return Mulroney to office. The
Liberals would tear up the deal if they win, Turner said.
   Polls show Canadians divided 50-50 on the issue and in favor of
an election.
   But Mulroney reacted calmly to what he termed Turner's ``act of
desperation'' and said he has a full legislative agenda to complete
before an election.
   He got a political boost Monday when a prominent Liberal, George
van Roggen, resigned as chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee so he could speak out in favor of free trade.
   Mulroney's camp hoped more Liberals would break ranks.
   ``There's a lot bubbling around here and we'll have to wait and
see what kind of stew comes out of the pot,'' Bruce Phillips, a top
Mulroney aide, said. ``John Turner has put a helluva lot of
pressure on a lot of senators.''
   Canada's second opposition party, the socialist New Democrats,
dislikes free trade. But party leader Ed Broadbent has accused
Turner of abandoning democracy by using the Senate to impede the
will of the elected Parliament.
   The Conservatives have climbed steadily in the polls this year,
while the other two parties have slumped.
   For Turner, deploying the Senate is a gamble because he gave the
Conservatives two diversionary election issues: his judgment in
defying elected legislators and the need for Senate reform.
   ``The election outcome may very well be determined more by
people's feelings about the Senate than about free trade,''
columnist Orland French wrote Monday in The Globe and Mail, the
national newspaper.
   The situation has many parallels with 1911. The Conservatives
then stirred up public opinion with the slogan ``No truck nor trade
with the Yankees'' and filibustered for five months to force
Laurier into an early election. Then, as now, the government had
not included free trade in its election platform.
   But in 1911, the Conservatives did not use the Senate to stop
the treaty.

<TEXT>
   More than 300,000 Mercedes-Benz automobiles
are under investigation to determine if hundreds of reports of
unintended acceleration are true, the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration says.
   The agency said Monday it had broadened its probe into
allegations that the vehicles speed up without the operator's
intervention to encompass 309,000 cars made by Mercedes from 1984
through 1988. The cars are all equipped with gasoline engines and
automatic transmissions.
   NHTSA in October had begun an investigation into 42,353
1986-1987 Mercedes Model 124 300E cars. The new engineering
analysis broadens the regulatory case to include the Mercedes
models 107 SL, 126 SE, SEL and SEC, and 201 190E.
   NHTSA said it has received reports of 301 instances of sudden
acceleration in the Mercedes cars. The agency said 217 of the
instances reportedly resulted in accidents that injured 92 people
and killed one person.
   Mercedes-Benz of North America will cooperate fully with the
NHTSA investigation, said A.B. Schuman, a spokesman for the company
in Montvale, N.J.
   He said in the company's investigation of 283
sudden-acceleration reports, ``our technicians have never found any
electrical, electronic or mechanical defect in our cars that could
cause unintended acceleration.''
   The Mercedes case is among six NHTSA investigations into alleged
sudden acceleration involving at least 4.8 million vehicles. Other
makers and the number of vehicles involved are Ford Motor Co., 3.2
million; General Motors Corp., 800,000; Audi, 255,000; Nissan,
183,000; and Honda, 62,500.
   The Mercedes investigation was opened at the request of the
Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group often at odds with the
auto industry and its regulators.
   ``The steady increase in sudden acceleration incidents in
numerous Mercedes models other than the 1986-87 300E demonstrates
that Mercedes' entire line of recent-year gasoline engine cars with
automatic transmissions is affected by this defect,'' the center
said.
   The center said it had received 164 reports of sudden
acceleration in Mercedes cars, resulting in 125 accidents, 46
injuries and one death.

<HEAD>USDA Says Peanut Program Hikes Prices But Keeps Quality High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's peanut program restricts
production and causes ``somewhat higher retail prices,'' says an
Agriculture Department economist.
   But the program also helps provide ``a steady, high-quality
supply of peanuts for consumers'' through a two-tiered price
support system, says Jim Schaub of the department's Economic
Research Service.
   The two-tier system is scheduled to continue at least through
the 1990 peanut marketing year. It involves a support rate for
peanuts grown under a national quota, and a much lower rate for
peanuts grown in addition to the quota.
   Quota peanuts are sold for domestic food and related uses, while
the ``additional'' peanuts are used for export or crushing into oil
and meal.
   Schaub, whose analysis is in the current National Food Review,
said net outlays by the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
averaged $10 million annually between 1982 and 1986, well below the
average of $30 million during the 1960s and the $61 million of the
1970s.
   ``The current program is expected to keep costs to U.S.
taxpayers to a minimum because the program is designed for quota
production to equal domestic food and related demand,'' he said.
   However, Schaub acknowledged that the peanut program could cost
substantially more if the national marketing quota greatly exceeded
what processors want to buy at the quota rate. Should that happen,
the government would wind up buying the unwanted peanuts and hold
them as surplus.
   The 1988 price support, or loan rate, is $615.27 per ton for
peanuts grown within a farmer's quota. The support for additional
peanuts is $149.75 per ton.
   Farmers put their crop in storage arranged by grower
associations. The peanuts then are pooled and controlled by the
associations and the CCC. If the association sells the peanuts at a
profit, growers participating in that pool are eligible for
dividend payments.
   If the peanuts cannot be sold on the market at the quota price,
the CCC is obligated to buy them at the quota rate.
   Schaub said the peanut program does raise consumer prices and
lower supplies by supporting farmers' prices and setting quota. But
it's difficult to say what prices would be without the program.
   ``We do know that the break-even price for peanuts _ the longrun
average price needed for growers to recover all production costs _
was about $420 (per ton) in 1986,'' he said. ``Therefore, a free
market price would likely be closer to $420 than the $607-a-ton
quota loan rate set for that year.''
   But Schaub added that even these numbers can be questioned
because the peanut programs _ which go back to 1934 _ have existed
so long that farmers have altered production and marketing
practices accordingly.
   Americans consume an average of about 8.5 pounds of peanuts a
year, on a per capita basis, including peanut butter and candy, as
well as roasted, salted and from the shell.
   Schaub said the government programs probably have not had a
significant impact on peanut demand, at least partly because there
are few good, comparably priced substitutes. In other words, he
said, lower prices would not necessarily mean substantially greater
consumption.

   A 26-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 64 in
southeastern Tennessee is the first segment of a new National
Forest Scenic Byways system set up by the Agriculture Department.
   Forest Service chief F. Dale Robertson said Monday the byway is
located in the Cherokee National Forest and passes through scenic
areas dominated by rock bluffs, mountain peaks and Lake Ocoee.
   The byway also offers ready access to white-water rafting,
boating, swimming and historical sites related to the Civil War and
the Cherokee Indian culture, he said.
   The program was begun this summer ``to increase the scenic
enjoyment of the millions of people who drive through national
forests each year,'' Robertson said.
   Despite a variety of more active recreational activities,
driving for pleasure remains the most popular in the nation's 156
national forests located in 43 states, he said.
   Various groups are working with the USDA agency to place
interpretive signs, develop brochures and provide facilities
designed to make a drive through the forests more enjoyable,
Robertson said.
   A spokesman for the agency, Jay Humphreys, said he expected
``probably three or four more'' scenic byways will be designated by
the end of summer. He said nominations are due by Oct. 1.
   The Tennessee byway was the first to be nominated and the first
to be approved, Humphreys said.

   The nation's hens worked a little harder last
month, but because of fewer birds the extra effort fell short of
the year-ago production mark, according to an Agriculture
Department report.
   June output was estimated at 5.52 billion eggs, down 2 percent
from June 1987, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said
Monday. Meanwhile, the number of hens in laying flocks declined 3
percent during the month to an average of 269 million birds.
   Individually, however, the fewer hens shelled out more eggs _ an
average of 2,054 eggs per 100 birds during June, up from 2,033 a
year earlier, the report said.

Race</HEAD>

   Some $46 million in public money to finance
Michael Dukakis' Democratic presidential campaign is being held up
temporarily by a tangle over running mate Lloyd Bentsen's dual
campaigns for vice president and the Senate.
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee filed a complaint
with the Federal Election Commission alleging that any money
Bentsen spends on his Senate re-election bid in Texas will directly
benefit the party's presidential ticket and give it an unfair
advantage over the Republicans.
   The FEC was considering the matter today. Commission spokeswoman
Sharon Snyder said the commission has 10 days to decide how to
handle the unprecedented issue.
   The Dukakis campaign filed its request for the money late
Friday, and the existence of the GOP complaint will add to the time
it takes to release the federal campaign funds, she said.
   Jann Olsten, executive director of the GOP Senate committee,
said at a news conference Monday that Bentsen is poised to spend
more than $4 million on his Senate re-election campaign at the same
time he is running for vice president. An unusual Texas law permits
Bentsen to seek both offices simultaneously.
   ``There is no denying that one (race) is going to impact the
other,'' Olsten said. ``A dollar spent by Senator Bentsen in Texas,
whether for the Senate or the vice presidential campaign, is going
to directly and immediately benefit both... It just isn't fair.''
   The 1976 law that created public financing for presidential
campaigns stipulates that candidates who receive the federal money
cannot accept private funds for their campaigns. The $46 million
each for the Democratic and Republican tickets comes from a $1
check-off on individual income tax returns.
   The NRSC, in a complaint filed Friday with the FEC, asked that
the government withhold the federal campaign funds until it either
bars the spending of Bentsen's Senate campaign chest or determines
to count any Senate campaign spending against the $46 million limit.
   Bentsen's Senate opponent, Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas, said at a
Houston news conference that Bentsen intends to circumvent the law
and should either bow out of the Senate race or not spend money
raised for the Senate race.
   ``Nobody expects him to do either,'' Boulter said. ``He wants it
both ways.''
   Bentsen spokesman Jack DeVore said Bentsen's legal advisers had
researched the issue and believed there was no problem with
conducting and financing both campaigns, and said the GOP was
trying to win a free ride for Boulter.
   ``They know the Bentsen Senate campaign would help the national
ticket whether Sen. Bentsen was part of the ticket or not,'' DeVore
said. ``What they're really saying is they're scared silly.''
   FEC spokeswoman Snyder noted that the only other case involving
a similiar, but not parallel situation, was in 1976 when Bentsen
ran for president and for the Senate.
   The commission at that time was asked to rule on whether he
could spend the legal limit for both his Senate and presidential
primary race. The decision was that he could not because he would
gain a `'significant publicity advantage'' over his rivals by
spending more money overall throughout Texas.
   But that ruling is not a good precedent for this case because
there are no limits on Senate campaign spending any more and the
issues are different, said Snyder.
   ``It was a different legal situation,'' she said.
   The current case is more likely to revolve around how various
campaign expenses are paid for _ such things as whether Senate
campaign photos of Bentsen with Dukakis could be paid out of his
Senate fund or would be considered presidential expenditures.
   Another potential gray area might involve which campaign would
pay for signs stating ``Vote Bentsen'' without any further
indication of what office was being referenced.
   Olsten said if the FEC should rule against the Republican
complaint it was likely that the party would seek a federal court
injunction to halt the flow of federal campaign money.
   Bentsen's latest Senate campaign report shows he has $3.9
million in cash on hand for his Senate race. Since the beginning of
1987, he has raised more than $6 million.

   Business is booming at the nation's movie
theaters this summer with hits like ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit''
producing revenues running well ahead of last year's record $4.2
billion take.
   ``The business is really rolling along. It's got momentum
because there's variety, a selection for every taste,'' John Krier
of Exhibitor Relations Co. said Monday.
   With the completion of eight weeks of the traditionally rich
summer season, more than $934 million worth of tickets have been
sold, 13 percent more than for the period last year.
   The industry trade paper Daily Variety said when all the
receipts are tallied the summer box office may reach $1.7 billion
compared with $1.59 billion a year ago.
   Analysts attributed the revenue gains to the diversity of this
summer's films _ ranging from mindless comedies, animated and
partially-animated films and violent, action-packed fare.
   ``When you have many popular films, you have a great summer,''
said Variety's Art Murphy. ``You notice there are no films that did
$10 million or more. That's because there is competition. It's the
quality of product.''
   Steven Spielberg's collaboration with Disney, ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit,'' featuring the technological wizardry of live and animated
characters, regained the No. 1 position at the nation's box offices
last weekend with a take of $8.9 million.
   It nudged out last week's top film ``Coming to America.'' The
second-place Eddie Murphy film earned $8.8 million, just $33,000
shy of the leader.
   Bruce Willis' ``Die Hard'' was third, Clint Eastwood's ``Dead
Pool'' was fourth, the Robert DeNiro-Charles Grodin comedy
``Midnight Run'' was fifth and the re-release of the 46-year-old
Disney classic ``Bambi'' was sixth.
   The mindless ``Big Top Pee-wee'' faired poorly in its debut,
bringing in $4.6 million to place seventh, and ``Caddyshack II''
was eighth with $4.4 million.
   The Tom Hanks hit ``Big,'' placing ninth, maintained its stature
after eight weeks of release by adding $3.9 million in receipts for
a total gross of $75.2 million. ``Bull Durham'' rounded out the top
10 with $2.4 million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release and estimated production costs when available.
   1. ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' Disney, $8.92 million, 1,402

   2. ``Coming To America,'' Paramount, $8.89 million, 2,064
screens, $4,305 per screen, $81.2 million, four weeks, $20 million.
   3. ``Die Hard,'' 20th Century Fox, $7.1 million, 1,276 screens,

<HEAD>Dukakis Sticking To Statehouse Duties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is maintaining his hybrid schedule
of Statehouse duties and presidential campaigning by tending to
gubernatorial tasks today, including a law-and-order event.
   Dukakis was spending most of today at the office, with a visit
to a new police post at a downtown subway stop to swear in six new
members of the state transit authority police force.
   The Massachusetts governor spent all of Monday at the
Statehouse, putting aside state business for an hour-long meeting
with Hungarian Prime Minister Karoly Grosz before the communist
leader headed to Washington to meet President Reagan.
   Wednesday also was to be a Statehouse day for Dukakis, who kicks
off an eight-state campaign swing Thursday.
   Dukakis kept a low profile Monday, refusing to comment as he
walked Grosz out of his office to an elevator surrounded by
reporters.
   Grosz is the first East European communist party leader to come
to the United States in 10 years and the first Hungarian leader to
visit this country in more than 40 years.
   At the top of Dukakis' state agenda is legislative unrest with
some of the $138 million in planned spending Dukakis vetoed from
the state's fiscal 1989 budget. Some lawmakers, irate over the
slashing of $91 million in local aid, have asked the legislative
leadership to halt a summer recess so they can attempt to override
the vetoes.
   ``Not to worry _ all is well,'' Dukakis said when asked Monday
afternoon to discuss a meeting between the administration's top
budget officer and House Speaker George Keverian.
   Dukakis' schedule this week fits with his primary season
practice of spending Monday through Wednesday at the Statehouse
before heading out to campaign. He is expected to continue that
pattern through much of the general election campaign.
   The tentative schedule for this week's trip includes stops in
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri, Illinois,
Wisconsin and North Carolina.
   Dukakis' running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, took a weekend
campaign trip with Dukakis but was not scheduled to campaign with
the governor this week.

   A one-time police chief, a former white
supremacist leader and three other men have been charged in what
prosecutors say was a scheme to pass $100,000 in counterfeit money
to raise money for paramilitary organizations.
   The federal indictment revealed Monday accuses James P.
Wickstrom, 45, with attempting to buy conterfeit $20 and $50 bills
through Victor F. Rizzo, a chiropractor in Cambria County, about 70
miles east of Pittsburgh.
   Wickstrom, who was arrested June 24, is a former leader of the
supremacist group, Posse Comitatus.
   At a hearing June 29, Secret Service agent Thomas Reddington
said Wickstrom planned to pass the fake bills for genuine currency
overseas to help support right-wing, paramilitary organizations.
   Also named in the six-count indictment was David F. Gardner, 44,
who was police chief in Youngstown, about 35 miles southeast of
Pittsburgh, from 1980 to 1983; and Thomas M. Ryan, 29, of Dublin,
Ireland, who was staying with Rizzo and was identified as his
driver.
   The indictment charges them with conspiracy, counterfeiting and
firearms violations.
   The fifth man named in the indictment, Harry Luttner of Latrobe,
is in Westmoreland County prison on state burglary charges. He is
accused of providing paper for the production of phony bills.
   Gardner now works as a paramilitary instructor, according to
documents prepared for his appearance before a federal magistrate
after his arrest Monday. He was released on $5,000 bond. He is
accused of agreeing to provide armed protection when the phony
money was purchased.
   Rizzo and Ryan were arrested June 22 when Rizzo took delivery of
counterfeit bills from an undercover Secret Service agent. They are
free on $10,000 bond.
   Wickstrom, who has been in custody since his arrest June 24,
served a 13-month prison sentence in Wisconsin for Posse-related
activities. He lives in Homer City, about 45 miles east of
Pittsburgh. Authorities claim he began a branch of the
white-supremacist Christian Identity Church in that town.

   Disturbances broke out among inmates at a
maximum-security prison, injuring eight guards, a prison
psychologist and three inmates, authorities said.
   ``It appears to be under control,'' Luther Starnes, assistant
press secretary to Gov. William Donald Schaefer, said about an hour
after ambulances were sent to the Maryland Penitentiary in downtown
Baltimore.
   State Police spokesman Cpl. Greg Shipley said no prisoners
escaped.
   Schaefer met Monday night with the prison warden and state
prison officials, and said afterward that he was satisfied with
their handling of the disturbance.
   Shipley said the disturbance began in the recreation yard
shortly before 1 p.m, spread to a crisis clinic where the
psychologist was having a session with inmates, and erupted again
in another section of the yard. He said a minor fire also was set
in the clinic.
   Baltimore police carrying shotguns immediately surrounded the
perimeter of the prison, and a police helicopter flew overhead.
Several downtown streets were blocked off, causing traffic backups.
   Prison officials did not know the reason for the three incidents
and do not think they were organized, Shipley said.
   Two homemade knives were recovered, and several gunshots also
were fired, he said.
   Officials said the prison immediately was ``locked down,'' with
inmates locked in their cells.
   Two inmates, one in critical condition and one in fair, were
being treated for gunshot wounds, said Anita Hisley, spokeswoman
for Johns Hopkins Hospital. The third inmate was being treated at
the prison hospital, which handles less-serious injuries, officials
said.
   One of the eight injured guards suffered a gunshot wound to the
neck, but authorities believe he may have been wounded by another
officer during the melee. He and two other guards were
hospitalized, while the others were treated and released.
   The psychologist was treated for facial injuries and released.
   The problem apparently resulted from an altercation that
possibly followed an aborted escape attempt, said Bill Bowlander,
executive director of Council 92 of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents
correctional officers.
   The penitentiary, which opened in 1811, ordinarily holds 700 to
800 men, but Monday's inmate count was 1,270. Eighteen of its
inmates are on death row.

<HEAD>Duarte Lauds Peace Plan; Rebels Attack Bowling Alley In San
Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
called a Central American peace plan a regional ``declaration of
independence'' but accused Nicaragua of not fulfilling obligations
under the year-old effort.
   Also Monday, guerrillas set fire to a bowling alley in the
capital to retaliate after police dispersed an anti-government
march, the manager said.
   No one was reported hurt and no group claimed responsibility for
the attack.
   Duarte, 62, appeared energetic Monday during his first news
conference since he returned to El Salvador July 11 after six weeks
of medical treatment in the United States. He is suffering from
terminal liver cancer and doctors give him six to 18 months more to
live.
   Duarte accused Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government of not
adhering to terms of the peace plan signed Aug. 7 in Guatemala by
the five Central American presidents.
   The plan calls for negotiations between governments and
insurgents to end civil wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala. It also calls for amnesties for politically motivated
crimes, moves toward democratization and a ban on outside support
for guerrilla movements.
   The plan ``has fulfilled many of its objectives and must be
considered a declaration of principles and, for me, it has been a
second declaration of independence for Central America,'' Duarte
said.
   ``In the short term, some of the plan's objectives have been
fulfilled, and some have not been fulfilled,'' he said, without
elaborating.
   ``Nicaragua, in signing (the accord), made an appearance of
trying to put it into practice, but obviously that put it into
confrontation with democracy,'' he added.
   Duarte accused the Sandinistas of supporting leftist Salvadoran
guerrillas battling his U.S.-backed government.
   Duarte's government declared an amnesty for political crimes and
lifted a state of emergency to comply with the peace initiative.
But there have been no talks between the government and rebels
since October.
   The foreign ministers of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and
Honduras meet Aug. 1 in Guatemala City with U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz to discuss the plan's achievements and shortcomings.
   Duarte said there are no plans for a meeting of presidents to
mark the initiative's first anniversary.
   Meanwhile, 10 to 12 masked men with pistols and at least one
submachine gun set fire to a bowling alley after taking money from
about 30 patrons and identifying themselves as ``urban commandos''
of the Faribundo Marti Liberation Front, said Guillermo Castro,
manager of the Bolerama Jardin.
   The front, a coalition of five guerrilla groups, has waged an
8-year-old war against the government.
   Castro said the guerrillas took ``money they said was a
`contribution' to the cause. They said the attack was in reprisal
for the government's repression of Thursday's march.''
   The guerrillas then doused several pool tables in a room
adjoining the main bowling area with gasoline and set them afire,
Castro said.
   Firefighters arrived within 15 minutes and extinguished the
blaze.
   Castro said none of the bowling alley's owners has any
connection with the government and that he did not understand why
the business was targeted.
   On Thursday last week, police used tear gas and fired shots in
the air to break up an anti-government demonstration in San
Salvador. Protesters then burned at least nine vehicles.
   Human rights groups estimate more than 65,000 people have been
killed in El Salvador since the civil war began in October 1979.

<TEXT>
   A judge has scheduled an impeachment
trial for an 85-year-old mayor who last week donned a turban and
rubber snakes while declaring ``National Voodoo Week.''
   But an attorney for Florala Mayor H.T. Mathis said the trial is
moot because the mayor's four-year term ends Oct. 3.
   ``Really I think he is more interested in clearing his name than
anything else,'' said attorney James Prestwood.
   Covington County Circuit Judge William Baldwin on Monday refused
to dismiss charges of neglect of duty, corruption and incompetency,
and set an Aug. 29 trial date.
   Last week, while clad in a turban and rubber snakes, Mathis
proclaimed ``National Voodoo Week'' at a midnight news conference
on the steps of the county courthouse.
   The mayor said ``National Voodoo Week'' was aimed at promoting
publicity for the town and peace among the residents.
   Attorney General Don Siegelman has accused Mathis of
mismanagement and improperly pardoning about two dozen drunken
drivers in Florala, a town of about 2,200 residents on the
Alabama-Florida border.
   Mathis has said he has pardoned numerous DUI convictions because
of what he calls overzealous police officers.
   Siegelman said Mathis' ``voodoo antics'' may be an issue at the
trial.
   Mathis said Siegelman had no right to ask a judge to empanel the
county grand jury that returned the impeachment recommendation.
   Prestwood said he was ``absolutely optimistic'' that Mathis
would be found innocent at the impeachment trial, but may seek a
delay to prepare for the trial.

<HEAD>US Serviceman Killed While Jogging Near Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A soldier who was jogging in a neighborhood
near Clark Air Base became the first U.S. serviceman to be killed
in the Philippines in nine months when gunmen shot him from a
speeding car, authorities said.
   A U.S. Air Force statement identified the victim as Technical
Sgt. Richard Blackmer, 31, of the Cleveland suburb of Brook Park.
Blackmer was assigned to the 1961 Communications Group.
   The statement said he was shot while jogging in the Mountain
View subdivision of Angeles City, less than a mile from the base's
main gate. Angeles City is 50 miles northwest of Manila.
   A Clark base spokeswoman, Capt. Maryellen Jadick, said ``initial
reports indicate the shooting was criminal in nature and not
politically motivated.'' Ms. Jadick, interviewed by telephone from
the Associated Press bureau in Manila, would not elaborate on how
Blackmer was killed.
   Police Lt. Federico Naguit said a car sped by Blackmer as he
jogged in Mountain View and gunmen in the vehicle sprayed the man
with automatic gunfire.
   It was the first slaying of a U.S. serviceman in the Philippines
since Oct. 28, 1987, when gunmen killed two active-duty American
servicemen and a retired U.S. military man outside Clark. Leftist
guerrillas claimed responsibility for the October attacks.
   The Pentagon said the Clark Office of Special Investigations and
local authorities are conducting a joint probe of the shooting.
   Nearly 40 people have been killed in Angeles City and other
communities around Clark Air Base since Jan. 1. Police say most of
the slayings are politically motivated, and consider the district
around the base a communist stronghold.

<HEAD>Agency Investigating Wiring Insulation at Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
re-evaluating the use of a wiring insulation found in most U.S.
nuclear power plants after discovering damaged electrical circuits
at several facilities, according to a published report.
   Uldis Potapovs, chief of the commission's unit that inspects
vendor-supplied plant equipment, said the insulating material known
as Kapton appears to damage easily under mechanical stress and even
in routine handling by plant maintenance crews, the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram reported in Tuesday's editions.
   Worn or damaged Kapton has been discovered on electrical wires
that connect reactor containment buildings with main-plant control
circuits located outside the reactor, Potapovs told the newspaper.
   He said such damage is a ``significant concern'' because it
could cause erroneous equipment readings or failure of equipment,
but there has never been a failure serious enough to produce a fire.
   Kapton can be found on wiring in most of the nation's 104
operating nuclear power plants, Potapovs said.
   Kapton, made by E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., is a thin,
lightweight insulation often used to wrap wiring in
high-performance aircraft. It has been cited as a factor in dozens
of aircraft fires and is suspected of contributing to dozens more,
the Star-Telegram has reported in a series of stories this week.
   Du Pont has long maintained that its insulation does not crack
or break any sooner than other insulation.
   The U.S. Navy, which has banned Kapton in its aircraft, says the
material deteriorates prematurely, cracks easily and even explodes
under certain conditions.
   But other Kapton users, including the Air Force and most
commercial aircraft builders, say the insulation is the best on the
market for the job.
   Asked if the NRC might call for a ban on Kapton in nuclear
plants, Potapovs said, ``That certainly would be a possibility.''
   But Potapovs added that it seems more likely that the agency
will issue a non-binding notice to plant operators recommending
that Kapton wires be reinforced with a sleeve or coating and that
maintenance crews be instructed in how to best handle the material.
   The NRC has already issued one notice dealing with Kapton
problems at nuclear power plants, agency records show. The agency
reported Feb. 4, 1987, that wires wrapped with Kapton had shorted
out because of ``insulation degradation'' on two occasions at
separate plants.
   The wires were in small electric motors that regulated the
opening and closing of steam supply valves at the plants.

<HEAD>Cancer Gene Linked To Breast And Lung Cancers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gene found to be defective in a rare
eye cancer has been linked to breast cancer and a common form of
lung cancer, researchers say.
   The gene was the first of a new group of anti-cancer genes that
normally protect against cancer but allow cancer to appear when
defective, said Ray White of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at
the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.
   Similar anti-cancer genes now have also been linked to colon
cancer, another common and lethal form of cancer.
   The findings that the gene is linked to breast cancer and
so-called small-cell lung cancer suggest that it and other
anti-cancer genes could play a major role in many types of human
cancer, White told genetics students at the Jackson Laboratory in
Bar Harbor on Monday.
   Identifying those genes and determining how they go wrong does
not mean cancer will then be eliminated, White said. But the
understanding of these genetic abnormalities is crucial to
ultimately being able to wipe out cancer, he said.
   Over the shorter term, he said, understanding the genetics of
cancer might allow doctors to diagnose subtypes of common cancers
and learn to treat them better.
   The gene was identified in children with a rare eye cancer known
as retinoblastoma. White and Webster Cavenee at the Ludwig
Institute for Cancer Research in Montreal were among the scientists
who made that initial discovery and learned how the gene worked.
   Later, those retinoblastoma children were found to develop
osteosarcoma, a bone cancer, also as a result of defects in the
retinoblastoma gene.
   More recently, researchers at the University of California, San
Francisco, led by Wen-Hwa Lee and Eva Lee, have found that the gene
is defective in certain breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory.
   About the same time, Frederic Kaye and colleagues at the
National Cancer Institute-Navy Medical Oncology Branch reported
seeing retinoblastoma gene defects in small-cell lung cancer cells
in the laboratory.
   ``It may well be that the majority of small-cell lung cancers
involve a lesion in the retinoblastoma gene as well as several
others,'' said White.
   Retinoblastoma affects perhaps 1,000 Americans annually, but
small-cell lung cancer strikes 30,000 people in the United States
every year, and breast cancer strikes 130,000.
   Suddenly, a gene that was important only in a rare disease is
now seen to be significant in two of the most important and most
devastating human cancers.
   Meanwhile, White had identified a similar anti-cancer gene in a
rare form of inherited colon cancer.
   He said Monday he has now shown that this anti-cancer gene plays
a role in the much more common non-inherited form of colon cancer
that is another one of the country's leading cancer killers.
   Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore also has identified several other genetic
defects associated with colon cancer.
   He estimated that perhaps as many as seven genetic defects must
occur for colon cancer to develop. He said he and White have now
identified five of those defects.
   ``You can look at these genetic alterations as the causes of
cancer _ just as you can look at bacteria as the causes of
infection,'' Vogelstein said in a telephone interview. ``Except
it's more complicated in cancer.''

   David Rose thought a clump of grass
got caught in his car's suspension during a camping trip. But he
was in for a surprise when he tried to remove the object.
   ``I touched it and it moved _ and then I moved, too!'' Rose, 33,
said Monday. ``I thought it was a snake or something.''
   The ``grass'' turned out to be a hedgehog, a small, spiny,
porcupine-like mammal. The hedgehog hitched 350 miles underneath
the car last weekend before Rose found the prickly little beast
curled up in the suspension.
   ``I thought it was grass,'' Rose said.
   Rose said he found the hedgehog while cleaning the car and his
camping trailer after a seven-hour drive from Cornwall, in
southwestern England, to Long Eaton, near Nottingham in the north.
   ``I dropped a screwdriver under the car,'' he said. ``The
hedgehog really surprised me.''
   Rose, a sheet-metal worker, dismantled the suspension and
removed the frightened animal, taking care not to touch it. He fed
the ``ravenous'' little creature cat food and milk.
   The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals later
picked up the hedgehog and planned to release it in the
countryside, Rose said.
   Hedgehogs, which grow to a foot in length including the tail,
are covered with sharp spines and often roll into a ball when
alarmed. They inhabit the undergrowth in woodlands and along the
edges of fields and rarely venture out in daylight.

   They pay no dues, have no scheduled meetings and
wear no skull rings.
   They have a policy of ``kindly waves of the left hand to
indicate fellowship'' with other riders.
   They are the Chickens From Heck Motorcycle and Bridge Club, an
organization not known for striking fear into the hearts of
motorists, small communities or other riders.
   ``The Chickens From Heck Motorcycle and Bridge Club do not
consider themselves superior or patronizing in any respect,'' said
Blair Chotzinoff, the five-member club's ``Grand Capon.''
   The club, whose motto is ``ride slow and snack often,''
undertakes no ``runs,'' or major trips. Its haphazard ride schedule
consists of last-minute phone calls when one of the Chickens feels
like a leisurely jaunt at ``highway speeds close enough to legal
limits to be of no interest to police,'' Chotzinoff said.
   A good thing. One of the Chickens is Denver Traffic Court Judge
Ray Satter.
   It would be a mistake to call them hard-core riders. They have
canceled more trips than they have taken because comfort plays a
major role in their decision-making.
   Last Thursday, for example, the Chickens rode to the Denver
Botanic Gardens for high tea.
   They bring pate and other gourmet treats on their Denver
Symphony Orchestra benefit rides _ a premium offered to those who
donate $50 or more during the orchestra's annual fund-raiser. They
have yet to make an out-of-state trip.
   ``We were going to take our first and go to Omaha, but there
were tornadoes and rainstorms that week and I don't know what
else,'' Chotzinoff said. ``So instead we went out to the Pawnee
Grasslands, but they had no more grass than anywhere else.
   ``We did find a great truck stop south of Greeley on that
trip,'' Satter said.

<HEAD>U.S. Doubts New Soviet Troops Have Entered Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say they have come up with no
hard evidence that Soviet troops are returning to Afghanistan,
despite a statement Saturday from Pakistan's President Mohammad Zia
al-Haq.
   The officials did tell The Associated Press on Monday, however,
that the Soviets would have difficulty meeting the Aug. 15 deadline
for withdrawing half the 115,000 troops they had in Afghanistan.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said Monday, ``We
fully expect the Soviets to honor their obligation under the Geneva
accords, to have half their troops out of Afghanistan by Aug. 15th,
and we'll continue to watch the situation carefully.''
   Redman said the United States had received assurances from
Moscow ``that they intend to meet their Afghan accord
responsibilities.''
   ``The basic fact of the matter is there is no evidence of a
re-introduction of Soviet troops,'' said one official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``We doubt they are sending new troops in, but it will be very
difficult to get the old ones out,'' another U.S. official said.
   The pace of withdrawal stalled over the last two or three
months, ``but they have enough time to get out by Aug. 15,'' a
third U.S. official said.
   U.S. officials still expressed concerned that some Soviet
military leaders found withdrawing under rebel fire difficult and
that the Soviet military commander in Kabul had indicated last week
that thousands of new troops would be sent to the embattled country.
   The commander's remarks were conveyed to Zia by the United
Nations team that is monitoring the Red Army's withdrawal.
   Zia then touched off alarm bells on Saturday with a statement
that the Soviets ``decided not only to stop their withdrawal, but
they have brought in something like 10,000 troops back from the
Soviet Union into Kabul because Kabul was under threat.''
   The Soviet military commander in Kabul may have spoken without
the authorization of his superiors in Moscow or he may have been
trying to unsettle the Pakistanis, who channeled U.S. weapons to
the rebels and took in hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees,
officials said.
   ``We may never understand what happened,'' one U.S. official
said. ``Maybe the Soviet general was speaking prematurely or they
were trying to get the Pakistanis off balance when he made the
statement to Zia.''
   In Moscow, the chief of the Soviet general staff, Marshal Sergei
F. Akhromeyev, rejected the Pakistani charge over the weekend as
``pure slander'' and said the Soviet withdrawal was ``proceeding in
full compliance'' with the Geneva accords.
   The Soviets pledged in the accords signed in May to withdraw
half their troops by Aug. 15 and the remainder by Feb. 15. The Red
Army has fought for 7{ years alongside the pro-Soviet government in
Kabul against the U.S.-backed rebels, some of whom want to
establish an Islamic fundamentalist state along the lines of the
one in Iran.

   A 16-year-old Oregonian who wants
to help child victims of drug and alcohol abuse was crowned Miss
Teen USA on Monday night at a pageant where a contestant was
disqualified.
   Pageant officials said only that the disqualification of Miss
Teen California, 16-year-old Alison Moreno, was prompted because
she broke a rule. She was allowed to participate in Monday night's
nationally televised contest.
   Mindy Duncan of Hillsboro, Ore., was delighted with her victory.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said the high school student on learning she
was the choice among 51 initial competitors, ages 15-18. ``It's a
feeling you can't explain.''
   Miss Duncan, a 5-foot, 3-inch enthusiast of dancing, running and
water skiing, said it is her ambition to work with children who
suffer drug and alcohol problems. She has done some of this work on
a volunteer basis.
   The four runners-up were: Jessica Collins of Amsterdam, N.Y.;
Amy Pietsch of Ringgold, La.; Kathleen McClellan of Bloomington,
Ill.; and Anna Mingus of Enterprise, Ala.
   An estimated 70 million viewers in the United States were
expected to watch the two-hour show, which was broadcast on CBS-TV.
The hosts were Dick Clark and actress Tracy Scoggins.
   The winner took the crown from 1987 Miss Teen USA Kristi Addis
of Holcolm, Miss., and $150,000 in cash and prizes, including a
Jeep, jewelry, a mink coat and mink jacket, exercise equipment and
an electronic keyboard.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Volcker, the former head of the Federal
Reserve Board, says the World Bank is in danger of fading away as
the biggest source of aid to the Third World unless Congress acts
soon to make a new contribution.
   The bank, headed by Barber B. Conable, a former congressman from
New York, wants a U.S. pledge of $70.1 million a year over the next
six years for a badly-needed increase in its capital.
   ``Our influence and leadership within the bank are certainly at
stake, and I would raise the question,'' Volcker told a news
conference on Monday, ``if the United States is not going to
participate in capital increases ... whether the bank itself can
survive over a long period of time.''
   So far, 140 of the 151 governments that own the bank have
decided to contribute. President Reagan has urged approval of the
U.S. contribution, but it has been held up in Congress by
disagreement over what should be done to handle the bulk of the
Third World's $1.2 trillion debt.

   Federal rules requiring shrimp fishermen to
use devices to prevent sea turtles from being snared and drowned in
nets would be delayed until next year under a compromise approved
by the Senate.
   The Senate on Monday gave voice vote approval to a compromise
worked out by opponents and backers of the regulation.
   The amendment proposed by Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., says
shrimp boats would not have to use turtle excluder devices in
offshore waters before May 1, 1989, or in inshore waters before May
1, 1990.
   The agreement allows debate to move forward on legislation to
reauthorize and strengthen the Endangered Species Act, which has
technically been without legislative authorization since Oct. 1,
1985. Senate leaders gave no indication when they expected to
complete work on the reauthorization bill.

<HEAD>New Regulations Adopted For Horse Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Horse shows for all breeds will be able to
continue under new Agriculture Department regulations that were
supported by horse organizations, according to Sen. Mitch McConnell.
   Horse shows for many breeds were closed earlier this year after
the American Horse Protection Association filed a lawsuit seeking
enforcement of regulations, primarily for walking horses, that had
adversely affected much of the industry.
   ``These recommendations were reached after weeks of negotiations
with every major horse organization throughout the country,''
McConnell, R-Ky, said Monday. ``Now that the regulations are
permanent, horse shows throughout Kentucky and the nation can
continue without the fear of being shut down.''
   Major provisions of the new regulations include a new uniform
standard for pads that would apply to all horse breeds; new rules
on pad material; rejection of a proposal by USDA to further limit
the weight of horseshoes; and new guidelines on examination
procedures for horses exhibited in walking horse shows.

   Filipino officials announced Tuesday
they were indefinitely suspending talks on the status of U.S.
military bases because of ``substantial disagreement'' with U.S.
officials over compensation.
   But an American spokeswoman said the break in the talks that
began in April was only temporary and that the U.S. side expects
the negotiations to resume ``shortly.''
   ``As has happened several times in the past, there has been a
temporary break in the talks,'' said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Mary
Carlin Yates in a telephone interview. Mrs. Yates is also the U.S.
panel's spokeswoman.
   ``We do not consider the talks suspended,'' she added. ``Such
temporary break occur from time to time particularly when one side
needs time to consider a proposal from the other.''
   The current talks are held every five years to review terms of
the 1947 agreement allowing the United States to keep Clark Air
Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations.
   The Manila government is pressing for an increase in the $180
million it receives annually from Washington for use of the bases.
Before the talks began, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said the
amount of $1.2 billion annually would be ``more realistic.''
   ``The amount offered (by the Americans) was far, far below what
we were demanding,'' said Leonides Caday, a member of the
Philippine panel. He added that the suspension would last
indefinitely, declined to elaborate.
   ``I don't see the point in continuing these talks,'' Juanita
Amatong, another Philippine panel member, quoted Manglapus as
telling U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt before the talks broke off.
   On Monday, Manglapus said that the two panels were nearing
agreement but that they may not complete the negotiations by an
end-of-the-month deadline.
   Tuesday's statement said only that ``there was substantial
disagreement on the compensation issue, as a result of which the
(Philippine) panel moved for the suspension of the talks.''
   The talks do not directly affect the status of the bases after
1991, when the agreement expires. But a successful review is
expected to influence the Manila government's decision on whether
to extend the agreement beyond 1991.
   President Corazon Aquino says she will honor the current
agreement but refuses to say whether she will support an extension
after 1991.
   Under the new Philippine Constitution, any extension must be in
the form of a treaty ratified by the Philippine Senate, where
opposition to the bases is currently strong.

<TEXT>
   An animator has given in to a conservative media
watchdog group and cut a segment from a Mighty Mouse cartoon, but
maintains the scene shows the cartoon character sniffing flowers,
not snorting cocaine.
   ``These 3{ seconds of footage have been taken totally out of
context by individuals who seem to be searching for sinister
undertones in a cartoon,'' animator Ralph Bakshi said in a
statement Monday.
   ``Some have chosen to interpret the frames as showing a
character using drugs,'' continued Bakshi, who won an Action for
Children's Television award for the Mighty Mouse series on CBS-TV.
``Nothing could be further from the truth.''
   But the Rev. Donald Wildmon, head of the American Family
Association, called Bakshi's decision a victory for his group.
   ``This is a de facto admission that indeed Mighty Mouse was
snorting cocaine,'' Wildmon said from his Tupelo, Miss., office.
``We have been vindicated by CBS itself.''
   Wildmon on Monday also demanded Bakshi's removal as producer of
the Saturday morning cartoon and reiterated his call for the firing
of Judy Parker, CBS-TV's vice president for children's programming.
He asked for a public apology by the network because of the April
23rd episode, titled ``The Littlest Tramp.''
   CBS said the cartoon has been rerun twice and will be shown
again, but no date was given.
   The 11-minute episode involves Mighty Mouse's efforts to save
Polly, ``a poor but industrious flower seller,'' from a villain who
destroys her flowers.
   Just before vanquishing the villain, Mighty Mouse either sniffs
cocaine (according to Wildmon) or inhales the aroma of flowers ``in
typical cartoon fashion'' (according to CBS).
   ``Mighty Mouse was happy after smelling the flowers because it
helped him remember the little girl who sold it to him fondly,''
said Bakshi, creator of the X-rated ``Fritz the Cat'' animated
movies in the 1970s.
   ``But even if you're right, their accusations become part of the
air we breathe. And that's why I cut the scene. I can't have
children wondering if Mighty Mouse is using cocaine.''
   Bakshi said the work of the American Family Association ``is the
same thing'' as McCarthyism.
   ``The principal thrust of this episode is to show the redeeming
quality of love and kindness,'' said CBS Entertainment President
Kim LeMaster in a statement supporting Bakshi. ``There is nothing
in the story line, the dialogue or the behavior of Mighty Mouse
that would suggest otherwise.''
   Wildmon last year pressured CBS into scrapping plans for a
cartoon based on the ``Garbage Pail Kids'' cards.
   Other targets of the fundamentalist preacher have been the
``Bloom County'' comic strip, and adult magazines like Penthouse
and Playboy. The 7-11 and Stop-n-Go convenience store chains
dropped Penthouse and Playboy in part due to pressure from Wildmon.

   An oil exploration ship crashed into a
barge and overturned, leaving 71 people missing and feared dead in
the second major boat accident in southwestern Sichuan province in
four days, reports said today.
   The Sichuan Daily said the Yunhang No. 24, a wooden vessel
leased by the Sichuan Petroleum Administration, overturned Monday
morning in the Yangtze River after colliding with a barge.
Twenty-five people were rescued.
   Most of those on board were workers from a geological
prospecting team, the report said.
   The collision took place in Yunyang county, about 280 miles east
of the provincial capital of Chengdu.
   The daily said the boat's engine died after the vessel slammed
into a rock. The boat then began drifting backward with the rapid
current, crashing into the oncoming barge.
   The report said the Yangtze, China's longest river, is deep and
swift-moving in the area of the accident, making rescue efforts
difficult. It said $675,000 of oil surveying equipment sank with
the ship.
   The daily also said 77 bodies had been recovered from a
passenger boat which sank on Thursday after hitting a rock in the
Min River, a tributary of the Yangtze.
   It said 153 people were rescued from the Chuanyun No. 24, while
more than 100 remained missing.
   The official Xinhua News Agency late Monday said 72 deaths had
been confirmed, 152 were safe and about 30 were unaccounted for.
   Estimates on the number missing have varied considerably, partly
because of poor communications with the remote mountain area where
the accident occurred and partly because of confusion over the
number of passengers aboard.
   The ferry reportedly stopped at several places along its route
from Yibin to Leshan, letting people off and taking on new
passengers.
   China has been plagued by disasters on its overcrowded
transportation system this year. Five fatal train accidents have
left 169 dead, while the crash of a Chinese airliner, also in
Sichuan in January, killed 108.

   Patti Shamp's young daughter,
Crystal, has been one of the few bright spots in her life since a
stroke disabled her two years ago.
   Today the 4-year-old girl is in the middle of a custody fight
between Ms. Shamp, 28, and her estranged husband, Danny Howdeshell.
At issue is whether a handicapped person can adequately care for a
child.
   ``I may not be capable of taking care of her, but, I can care
for and love very much and do,'' Ms. Shamp said in a message
printed through her computer. The stroke has left Ms. Shamp unable
to speak.
   ``I have overheard Crystal say she wants to stay here. Why
shouldn't she? I am her mother! What about the way I feel or
doesn't that matter anymore?'' asked Ms. Shamp, who uses a
wheelchair and has been living in a nursing home since October 1986.
   Ms. Shamp, in order to keep Crystal, has asked her parents, Max
and Joan Shamp, to seek temporary custody of the child, who has
been living with them since she was 8 months old.
   The Shamps, who live in this town of 3,100 residents, filed for
temporary custody in May 1987. Howdeshell, who lives in Morenci,
Ariz., later filed for permanent custody.
   The case is in the hands of Wood County Probate Court Judge
Robert Pollex, who listened to five hours of testimony at a hearing
last week. He is expected to make a decision the first week of
August.
   Jeff Lublin, Howdeshell's lawyer, said his client's rights are
paramount to those of the grandparents, since the child's mother is
unable to care for Crystal.
   But Mrs. Shamp said in an interview that taking Crystal away
from them would be ``just like taking one of our own away.''
   ``We have raised that little girl,'' she said. ``The only reason
we filed for temporary custody is because Patti asked us to. We all
want Crystal to stay here.
   ``Everybody seems to treat Patti as though she doesn't exist,
like she was dead. Mentally, there is absolutely nothing wrong with
her. It seems that her feelings about Crystal don't count because
she's handicapped,'' she said.
   Ms. Shamp met Howdeshell when her family lived in Morenci in the
late 1970s. But shortly after they were married in 1979, their
relationship soured.
   After they separated several years ago, Howdeshell gained
custody of their son, Shane, now 7. Ms. Shamp had custody of
Crystal and went home to live with her parents, who had moved to
this village 25 miles south of Toledo. Ms. Shamp was granted a
divorce in 1986.
   Ms. Shamp later moved to South Carolina, leaving Crystal with
her parents while she tried to put together her life. She suffered
the stroke Sept. 10, 1986.
   Since then, Ms. Shamp has lived in the St. Francis
Rehabilitation Center and Nursing Home in nearby Green Springs. She
sees Crystal on the weekends at her parent's house.
   At the hearing, Howdeshell said he believed his daughter would
be ``better off in a healthier atmosphere with her brother.
   ``I love my daughter and believe she should be with us,'' he
said.
   The Shamps said they can provide a loving home for Crystal.
   ``She's all that Patti has. Patti looks forward to seeing her
daughter. She looks forward to coming home on the weekends ... to
having Crystal crawl up on her lap and hug her. If you take this
away, it may be taking the only thing that Patti has that is worth
fighting for,'' Mrs. Shamp said.

<HEAD>Government Lifts Import Ban On Beef</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government sought to cool trade
tensions today by lifting a 3-year-old ban on imported beef, but
limited this year's shipments to 14,500 tons.
   Agriculture Minister Yun Kun-hwan, who made the announcement,
did not say how much beef will be imported after this year, but
indicated imports will be limited in order to protect the local
beef industry.
   Officials said the government will maintain an import quota
system, which has been opposed by Washington.
   The end to the import ban was designed to avoid trade friction
with foreign countries while at the same time alleviating domestic
beef shortages, Yun said.
   Washington has been pressing South Korea to drop the ban on beef
and many other imports to help correct Seoul's $10 billion trade
surplus with the United States.
   There was no immediate reaction from local farmers who have
strongly opposed imports of beef unless the government guaranteed a
definite price support system before lifting the import ban.
   Many Korean farmers went bankrupt due to an excessive import of
foreign beef cattle before the last ban was imposed in 1985.
Farmers have staged demonstrations to demand retention of the
import ban.
   Imported beef will be stockpiled in case the government needs to
stabilize prices if domestic sales prices exceed designated levels,
Yun said.
   Yun has said previously that this year's proposed quota will
include 3,000 tons of high-quality American beef for tourist
hotels. Officials said that beef could start arriving next month.

   A mild earthquake jarred the central
Coast Ranges area, apparently causing a small landslide near
Hollister. No damage or injuries were reported.
   The quake struck at 8:27 p.m. Monday and measured 4.5 on the
Richter scale, said the University of California Seismographic
Station at Berkeley. Its was centered 10 miles north of King City
and 40 miles southeast of Monterey, said seismologist Robert
Uhrhammer.
   State forestry workers discovered the landslide 18 miles outside
Hollister in San Bernardino County shortly after the earthquake,
said spokeswoman Debbie Fortulgaliza.
   ``I would have to think it (the earthquake) was what caused
it,'' she said. The rocks blocked a road until they were removed.
   Liz Liskey, a dispatcher with the Monterey County sheriff's
department in Salinas, said the quake was felt by people working in
the basement of the county courthouse. ``It was just a little
one,'' she said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.0 can cause moderate damage.

   Negotiations to end the 20-week-old
scriptwriters strike continued past midnight Monday's deadline set
by a federal mediator.
   At the opening of contract talks Monday afternoon,
representatives of the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers were told they had nine
hours to end their labor dispute that has crippled the industry.
   ``At 12 midnight, we're going to be through,'' said Floyd Wood,
district director for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service. ``I'm going to conclude the negotiations at midnight.''
   But the talks continued after midnight.
   Wood, one of two mediators taking part in Monday's talks, did
not say what would happen if the two sides were unable to reach a
settlement by that time. He did say, however, the deadline was
imposed ``to keep these people thinking about solutions'' and push
them toward a settlement.
   Wood also had said the writers and producers were making
progress in the marathon contract talks, which were ordered by
mediator Leonard Farrell last week and began Saturday. ``Both sides
are working hard,'' Wood said.
   Because of a news blackout ordered by Farrell, neither the WGA
nor the producers alliance could comment on the negotiations.
   WGA sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said earlier Monday that the producers
alliance so far has made few concessions in weekend bargaining
sessions, the first two of which lasted 13 hours each.
   At issue in the strike, which began March 7, are payments for
one-hour television programs rebroadcast domestically and all
television shows rebroadcast overseas.
   On June 22, the WGA roundly rejected the producers' last
contract offer, which the producers alliance has repeatedly
described as ``final.''
   The strike has resulted in a delay of the fall television season
and sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry.
   The WGA is proceeding with pickets called for Wednesday morning
at the offices of television producer Aaron Spelling and the Warner
Bros. and Columbia studios.

   Police plan to demonstrate at a
performance next month by Willie Nelson because the country singer
participated in a fund-raiser for Leonard Peltier, an American
Indian convicted of killing two FBI agents.
   Charleston-area officers intend to follow the lead of Rhode
Island police, who planned a demonstration this weekend at a Nelson
concert to express their displeasure with Nelson's support of
Peltier, who was convicted in the agents' deaths in a 1975 shootout
on a South Dakota reservation.
   Last October, Nelson participated in a concert in Costa Mesa,
Calif., to raise money for Peltier's supporters, who are seeking a
new trial.
   This weekend, Nelson will play at Warwick, R.I., and on Aug. 27
he is scheduled to open the Charleston Sternwheel Regatta. Both
performances are unrelated to Peltier's case.
   ``I'm kind of surprised an entertainer would try to raise funds
for someone who's killed two policemen,'' said Al Leavitt of West
Virginia Fraternal Order of Police. ``It's just a slap in the
face.''
   Bill Brotherton, president of the Charleston Festival
Commission, said he wasn't expecting any problems at the Regatta.
   ``He's not raising any money for anybody but the Charleston
Festival Commission when he's here,'' Brotherton said.
   In 1983, Nelson ordered patrolling police officers off the stage
before performing at an outdoor concert here.

<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro today marks the
35th anniversary of his revolutionary fight to power, facing a
battle against inefficiency that has dogged the economic
performance of his communist state.
   Castro traditionally gives his most important speech of the year
on the anniversary of his failed effort to take the Moncada
garrison here on July 26, 1953. He came to power less than six
years later, on Jan. 1, 1959.
   The government has a 2-year-old ``rectification campaign'' to
eradicate employee absenteeism, low productivity and other signs of
inefficiency in the island nation's economy.
   But domestic commercial production fell by 3.2 percent last
year, while Cuba's foreign debt grew by $671.8 million to $5.6
billion. The economy is heavily dependent on the sugar industry,
which has suffered poor harvests for three consecutive years
because of severe drought.
   In marked contrast to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
``perestroika,'' or restructuring that involves economic
liberalization, Castro has moved away from economic incentives and
loosening state economic controls to focus on moral persuasion in a
bid to increase productivity.
   ``I don't see why one thing should be linked with the other,''
Manuel Menendez Diaz, editor of the Cuban Communist Party monthly
magazine El Militante, told foreign correspondents Monday when
asked about the apparent differences between Cuban and Soviet
policy. ``The problems are our problems ... stemming from our own
situation,'' he said.
   Menendez Diaz said that political work was neglected in favor of
economic incentives in the decade preceding the rectification
campaign. The government implemented, then abandoned, such
experiments as a restricted free market for agricultural goods.
   ``The formation of the New Man was lost a little,'' Menendez
Diaz said.
   Although a possible Cuban agreement with South Africa and Angola
that could lead to the withdrawal of nearly 50,000 Cuban troops
from Angola has drawn heavy international attention, officials in
Cuba have been reluctant to discuss the issue and there is little
mention of ongoing talks in the domestic news media.
   Cuban newspapers instead have focused almost entirely on the
anniversary celebration, including extensive historical
recollections of the failed battle and the startlingly young faces
of Castro and his companions 35 years ago.
   The attack Castro led on the Moncada military barracks in
Santiago, Cuba's second city after Havana, failed. But the
brutality with which it was suppressed by the regime of Fulgencio
Batista triggered popular support for Castro's later revolutionary
insurrection.
   Celebration plans called for Pioneer Youth groups to recreate
each step of the Moncada attack.
   Castro has been in the Santiago area since last week to
inaugurate public works projects, including the nation's second oil
refinery, built with Soviet help, and a new hotel held up as an
example of what can be done to expand the tourist industry and
attract badly needed foreign exchange.
   Castro timed the attack on Moncada, now a museum and elementary
school, to coincide with the traditional Carnival celebration to
take government forces by surprise. Carnival still is celebrated
these days simultaneously with the Moncada anniversary.

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita today ordered an
all-out search for 21 people still missing after a collision
between a submarine and a fishing boat.
   Nine people have been confirmed dead and Takeshita, during a
Cabinet meeting earlier today, ordered an extensive effort to find
the rest of the passengers, Defense Agency chief Tsutomu Kawara
told a news conference.
   The crash happened Saturday afternoon when the 2,200-ton
submarine Nadashio collided head-on with the 154-ton Fujimaru, a
charter fishing boat, while the naval vessel crossed a busy
shipping lane near the entrance of Tokyo Bay.
   Of the 48 people aboard the charter boat, 19 people were
rescued, but one died later in a hospital. Twenty-one others are
missing and presumed dead.
   None of the 75 crewmen aboard the submarine were reported
injured.
   The Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard, said about 200
divers continued to search for the missing people while others
worked on the ocean bottom today to attach cables to the hull of
the boat in an effort to raise it with a crane.

   The Miss Teen USA pageant crowned
a petite redhead who wants to help child victims of drug or alcohol
abuse, but disqualified a contestant and declined to say why.
   The winner of Monday night's nationally televised pageant was
16-year-old Mindy Duncan of Hillsboro, Ore.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said the Newberg High School student. ``It's
a feeling you can't explain.''
   Miss Duncan, a 5-foot, 3-inch enthusiast of dancing, running and
water skiing, said it is her ambition to work with children who
suffer drug or alcohol problems. She has done some of this work as
a volunteer.
   Midway through Monday night's proceedings, officials began
referring to 50 contestants instead of the 51 initially entered.
   No formal announcement of the disqualification of Miss Teen
California, 16-year-old Alison Moreno of El Toro, was made until
reporters questioned the change in the number of contestants.
   Roger Neal, a pageant spokesman, said in a brief statement that
Miss Moreno broke a pageant rule. She was allowed to participate in
the CBS-TV broadcast but was dropped from eligibility.
   Later, a newspaper reporter who persisted in attempting to
determine why Miss Moreno was declared ineligible was escorted from
the pageant site by security guards and told not to return.
   Pageant officials said the matter of eligibility rested between
the pageant and Miss Moreno, and declined to elaborate, citing her
age.
   TV personality Dick Clark and actress Tracy Scoggins were hosts
of the pageant, whose contestants ranged from ages 15-18.
   Miss Duncan succeeds Kristi Addis of Holcolm, Miss., and wins
$150,000 in cash and prizes, including a Jeep, jewelry, a mink coat
and mink jacket, exercise equipment and an electronic keyboard.
   This year's four runners-up were: Jessica Collins of Amsterdam,
N.Y.; Amy Pietsch of Ringgold, La.; Kathleen McClellan of
Bloomington, Ill.; and Anna Mingus of Enterprise, Ala.

   Guards quelled an uprising at the overcrowded
177-year-old Maryland Penitentiary in less than an hour, but
officials were unsure today what sparked the knifings and gunshots
that left 12 people injured.
   In Massachusetts, about 30 inmates, some with metal pipes and
clubs, brawled in an exercise yard at a maximum-security prison,
officials said. Two sustained minor injuries in Monday's
disturbance.
   Authorities here were trying to determine whether a corrections
officer shot a fellow guard during Monday afternoon's riot. The
injured officer was one of four guards still hospitalized today
after order was restored at the downtown maximum-security prison.
   In all, eight guards, three inmates and a prison psychologist
suffered broken bones, knife wounds or gunshot wounds in the melee,
which was confined to the recreation yard and crisis clinic,
officials said.
   ``I think the warden acted properly. I think ... he took action
as soon has he felt there was something unusual happening,'' Gov.
William Donald Schaefer said in defense of prison warden James
Rollins.
   Schaefer said that after Rollins noticed only a few inmates
turned up for breakfast and lunch, he bolstered the 116-guard force
by transferring some officers from administrative posts to the yard.
   The disturbance began in a yard about 12:45 p.m., spread to the
clinic where the psychologist was conducting a session with
inmates, and erupted again in another section of the yard, said a
state police spokesman, Cpl. Greg Shipley. He said a minor fire
also was set in the clinic.
   ``There were assaults on guards by groups of inmates,'' Shipley
said.
   Shipley didn't know if the disturbances were coordinated. He
said the penitentiary tactical force suited up in riot helmets and
batons to quell the uprisings.
   The prison was locked down by early afternoon and remained so
today, officials said. Two homemade knives and two baseball bats
were recovered.
   Throughout the day and evening, city police officers remained
stationed near the 1811 prison, the nation's second-oldest, and
helicopters circled.
   One inmate was in critical condition after surgery for gunshot
wounds to the head and neck, while another was in fair condition
with a gunshot wound to the head, said Johns Hopkins Hospital.
   One guard was listed as serious at Hopkins and one was in
surgery there early today.
   Two other guards were listed as stable at Mercy Medical Center.
Four guards and the pyschologist were not hospitalized.
   Spokesmen for two of the three unions representing the guards
blasted corrections officials for deteriorating conditions at the
prison, which housed 1,270 inmates on Monday though it's supposed
to hold 700 to 800.
   In Massachusetts, officials said the brawl at the Cedar Junction
prison at Walpole was divided along racial lines and may have
resulted from the stabbing of a black prisoner by three whites
Sunday night. The victim was hospitalized in stable condition with
stab wounds to the chest.
   On Monday, 60 to 70 inmates climbed through the windows of an
industrial workshop to try to join the brawl, but were stopped when
a tower guard fired warning shots into the air, said Deodato
Arruda, a state Department of Correction spokesman.
   Arruda said the fighting lasted less than 15 minutes. Two
inmates suffered cuts requiring ``two or three stitches'' at the
prison infirmary.
   No guards were injured, he said.

<HEAD>Arafat Aide: Reagan Representative Asked Delay In Hostages'
Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A representative of then-candidate Ronald Reagan
asked the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1980 to try to delay
Iran's release of the American hostages until after the U.S.
presidential election, a PLO offical said.
   The White House quickly denied the allegation made to Playboy
magazine by an aide to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Also in the magazine's September issue, Arafat said a close
adviser to then-President Jimmy Carter sought the PLO's help in
speeding the release. In the wake of the 1973 war between Israel
and its Arab neighbors, the United States agreed not to have
contacts with the PLO because the organization refuses to recognize
Israel's existence.
   Minutes after Reagan's inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, the 52
Americans held 444 days at the U.S. embassy in Tehran were freed.
   In the interview, Arafat said he was instrumental in helping
thousands of Americans escape from Beirut in 1976 and 1977, and in
winning release of some of the U.S. hostages in 1980.
   ``We released the first hostages from the embassy, the first 13
embassy personnel,'' Arafat said. ``They were released according to
my personal efforts.''
   Arafat said he undertook the mission at the request of Carter.
   ``There was a special and permanent contact between me and
President Carter,'' Arafat said. ``I have written documents from
President Carter himself.''
   Arafat said that although he had a letter of thanks from former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for his help in 1976 and 1977,
the U.S. government never acknowledged his alleged role in the 1980
hostage release.
   Arafat's chief adviser, Bassam Abu Sharif, said in the interview
that a member of Reagan's 1980 campaign staff asked the PLO to help
stall the release.
   Reagan's supporters in 1980 made much of Carter's failure to
obtain the release of the hostages.
   ``We were told that if the hostages were held, the PLO would be
given recognition ... and the White House door would be open for
us,'' said Sharif.
   ``It is not true,'' White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk
countered Monday in a telephone interview from Washington. Popadiuk
declined to elaborate.
   Sharif said he met in Beirut with one of Reagan's ``closest
friends'' during the 1980 presidential race. He identified the
supporter as a major financial contributor to the campaign but did
not name the individual.
   Sharif said the Reagan associate ``asked that I contact the
chairman and make the request.''
   Carter was not available for comment Monday, but a spokeswoman
said he had been asked previously about reports that a Reagan
supporter had attempted to delay the hostages' release.
   ``We have reports similar ... but I never sought or received any
confirmation of the allegations,'' Melissa Montgomery quoted Carter
as saying.
   Neither Arafat nor Sharif was paid for the interviews, which
were conducted in April and May, said magazine spokesman Bill Paige.
   He said he did not know if Arafat was present when Sharif made
the allegation that a Reagan ally had sought the PLO's help in
delaying the hostages' release. Arafat made no comment on the
allegation in the printed interview.

   Iran claimed Iraqi troops pushed further
into Iranian territory today as a United Nations team arrived in
Tehran to discuss a truce between the Persian Gulf enemies.
   Iraq, after a series of sweeping attacks during the weekend,
denied the claim and said it was moving its forces out of Iran and
would take its dispute to the bargaining table.
   Meanwhile, the National Liberation Army of Iran, an Iraqi-backed
forced opposed to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, claimed its forces
had taken two Iranian towns and had marched 95 miles into Iran.
   In New York, diplomats for both countries were preparing to meet
Wednesday with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
discuss an end to the 8-year-old gulf war.
   A separate team of U.N. advisers arrived in Tehran today to
begin working on the technical aspects of a truce. Lt. Gen. Martin
Vadset, the team leader, said he will explore ways to implement and
maintain a cease-fire, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the seven officials would
remain in Tehran for three days, then fly to Baghdad.
   Another team of U.N. experts is already in Tehran to determine
the status of prisoners of war.
   The peace moves were made possible after Iran announced July 18
that it accepted a U.N. resolution calling for a cease-fire. Iraq
accepted the resolution shortly after it was adopted in July 1987.
   But since then, Iraq has sought to take as many Iranian
prisoners as possible, saying it captured more than 8,000 in three
days in attacks that began Friday, apparently as a bargaining chip
during peace talks.
   A communique carried by the official Iraqi News Agency said
Iraqi troops would ``be withdrawn in line with our declared policy
that we have no territorial ambitions in Iran.''
   Announcers on state-run Iraqi television said troops would pull
back today from Qasr-e Shirin, Sumar and Sar-e Pol-e Zahab, all on
the central war front.
   A military spokesman said on Baghdad radio today that Iraqi
forces had pulled out of Gilan-e Gharb in the morning and would
soon withdraw from the other towns.
   But the Iranian news agency said Iraqi troops thrust further
into Iran early today and tried to take the town of Karand, 35
miles from the border, and the nearby town of Eslamabad.
   It said Iranian fighters launched a counter-offensive and pushed
the Iraqis out of Karand, killing or wounding hundreds, with the
help of residents.
   It said the Iraqis still held Eslamabad but Iranian forces were
battling to free the town in ``heavy fighting.''
   The deputy speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Mehdi Karrubi,
announced the legislature was to be ``temporarily closed so that
the deputies may go to the war fronts,'' the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   In Baghdad, Information Minister Latif Jassem called the Iranian
claims ``lies and fabrications'' and re-asserted that Iraq planned
to complete its pullout on the central front today.
   A spokesman in Baghdad for the National Liberation Army, an
alliance of anti-Khomeini exile groups, claimed it took Karand.
   Large numbers of Iranian troops in the area defected to the
opposition army, bringing their weapons and equipment, said the
spokesman, Alireza Jafarzadeh.
   He said ``several divisions'' of the army were 95 miles inside
Iran and heading toward the provincial capital of Bakhtaran.
   The conflicting claims could not be independently confirmed.
   Perez de Cuellar said Monday in New York that he will meet
separately with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his
Iraqi counterpart Tariq Aziz. He said Iran is not yet prepared to
have direct talks with its enemy, but the U.N. chief said he may
suggest direct meetings later.
   ``We have certainly contemplated direct talks,'' he said. He
predicted a truce could be implemented within 10 days.
   The resolution provides for a cease-fire, withdrawal to
recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an
investigation of which side started the war.
   In a related development, members of the U.N. Security Council
began private consultations Monday on an Iranian complaint that
Iraq used chemical weapons in the weekend offensive. The use of
chemical weapons violates the 1925 Geneva Convention.
   In Washington, President Reagan said Monday the United States is
prepared now to talk to Iran about American hostages held in
Lebanon. An administration official said the potential end of the
Persian Gulf war might signal a thaw in U.S.-Iran relations.

<HEAD>Feds Indict `Marco Polo' of Drug Smuggling, 21 Others in Asian
Marijuana Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Briton dubbed the ``Marco Polo of drug
trafficking'' was arrested on a federal indictment charging 22
people with running a worldwide hashish and marijuana smuggling
ring based in Asia, authorities said.
   The indictment accuses all 22 defendants of racketeering,
including ringleader Dennis Howard Marks, interim U.S. Attorney
Dexter Lehtinen told a news conference Monday.
   Marks, 42, was arrested Monday in Madrid, Spain, with his wife,
Judith, and fellow Briton Geoffrey Kenion.
   Marks was previously acquitted of drug charges in England after
falsely claiming he worked for MI5, the British counterintelligence
agency, Lehtinen said.
   Marks, an Oxford University graduate and a London resident,
operated all over the world, authorities said.
   ``He was the Marco Polo of drug trafficking,'' said Thomas Cash,
head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Miami office.
   The ring led by Marks for 17 years shipped marijuana from
Thailand and hashish from Pakistan, authorities said. It operated
in England, West Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal,
Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States and other
countries.
   ``They shipped in ton quantities, thousands of tons,'' said
Lehtinen.
   The ring had its own ship and amassed $30 million in property
that the U.S. government now wants confiscated, he said.
   The traffickers laundered money through banks and corporations
around the world, officials said.
   Lehtinen said he expected Spain to quickly extradite the
Markses, Kenion and William Roger Reaves, who was arrested several
weeks ago in that country.
   More arrests were expected, including some in the United States,
Lehtinen said.
   Several of the people indicted were Marks' relatives. Patrick
Alexander Lane, a British citizen arrested Monday in Miami, Marks'
brother-in-law, authorities said.
   ``Marks made a family enterprise out of it, using his wife, his
brother-in-law and sister-in-law,'' said Cash.
   Marks was the subject of ``The Life and High Times of Dennis
Marks,'' a British book in which he detailed his drug career in the
late 1970s and early 1980s.

   Ten elementary school pupils from one of the
city's poorest, roughest neighborhoods were leaving for a
three-country tour of Africa after studying French and raising
$30,000 for the trip.
   The pupils at Suder Elementary School on the West Side have
worked since October, studying African culture after school and
getting shots, passports and visas in preparation for their
departure this afternoon, Principal Brenda Daigre said Monday.
   The children, aged 11 to 14, will make a one-day stopover in
Brussels, Belgium. Then it's on to Dakar, Senegal; Abidjan, Ivory
Coast; and Lome, Togo. They are scheduled to return to Chicago Aug.
9.
   In preparing for their trip, the youngsters have heard African
speakers and visited the U.S. Customs Service branch at O'Hare
International Airport here, Mrs. Daigre said in a telephone
interview.
   ``We taught them how to set long-range goals,'' and how to meet
short-term goals along the way, she said. ``I think we have made
them much more sophisticated about meeting people ... how to carry
themselves.''
   Mrs. Daigre, one of five adults going on the trip, helped
organize it.
   She said setting up travel to any country would be instructive
for the students, but that for students from an all-black school it
would be particularly beneficial to visit countries dominated and
run by blacks.
   ``I have traveled extensively, and nothing hit me as hard as
when I went to Africa,'' said the principal, who also is black.
``There is a kinship that you feel, there is an openness that you
feel.
   ``I felt as though I went home, I really did,'' she said.
   Yo-seanda Baines, 13, who will be an eighth-grader at Suder this
fall, said she's anxious to meet people in Africa and see ``how
they dress and the food they eat.'' She also wants to see what
houses and clothes look like in Africa.
   Yo-seanda's mother, Vernya Baines, said she thinks the trip will
be a ``beautiful experience'' for her daughter, who has never been
on an airplane or traveled out of Illinois.
   ``We're poor, but I think it'll give them a chance to see people
that are poorer than we are,'' Mrs. Baines said. ``Maybe she'll
appreciate some of the things she maybe takes for granted.''
   More than $30,000 was raised for the trip from churches,
community groups and fund-raising events such as candy sales, said
Mrs. Daigre, who is paying her own way. The cost for each child is
$2,700.
   School officials told the students that some African cities
would look much like American cities, and that the old stereotype
of Africa as a land of villages and huts may not apply, Mrs. Daigre
said.
   ``Abidjan is referred to as the Paris of Africa,'' she said.
``When you go downtown, you think you are in a small, metropolitan
city.
   ``The lesson from that is travel and find out for yourself.''

   Two states, Louisiana and Texas, ended fiscal
year 1988 in the red while Arkansas and Alaska expect deficits in
1989, according to a national survey.
   The study, released Monday by the National Conference of State
Legislatures, said the total budget balance of the 50 states on
June 30, the end of fiscal year 1988, was $6.1 billion.
   That equaled 2.6 percent of overall general-fund state spending
in fiscal 1988 _ about half the minimum surplus economists
recommend.
   ``The margin of safety for many states is not much,'' said Steve
Gold, fiscal affairs director for the lawmakers' group. ``But it's
amazing, I think, that more states didn't have problems.''
   Louisiana showed an 18.9 percent deficit for 1988 and Texas a
3.4 percent deficit.
   In last year's survey, Louisiana and Texas also were the only
states with deficits.
   The new survey also found Arkansas projected a 10.2 percent
deficit in 1989 and Alaska a 3.5 percent deficit for that year.
   In addition, it found that 43 states estimated they had
surpluses for fiscal 1988.
   Wyoming led with a 17.7 percent budget surplus this year,
followed by Nebraska at 15.7 percent, Hawaii at 15.5 percent,
Delaware at 15.3 percent, Nevada at 14.8 percent, Indiana at 13.1
percent and Rhode Island at 10.1 percent.
   Those were the only states with double-digit percentage
surpluses this year, according to the survey of 49 states. Complete
information from Massachusetts did not come in time to make the
survey.
   Overall, the preliminary survey indicated that a strong national
economy helped 20 states become better off in 1988 than in 1987,
while 18 states held their own and 10 states declined.
   ``In many states, there has been an improvement over the past
few years,'' Gold said at the meeting of 1,500 of the nation's
state legislators, who are in town through Friday for their annual
conference.
   Gold said many of the fiscal problems have been caused by
budgeting uncertainty because of unpredictable federal policies.
   States like California, New York, Florida and Washington are
``traveling in unchartered waters'' because of several U.S. law and
policy changes, he said.
   Those include tax reform, federal mandates for new state
programs that lack the necessary funding, and reduction of federal
funding in areas such as housing, welfare, education and
transportation.
   ``People were really working in the dark,'' Gold said. ``States
are gradually taking on more and more roles. Where the federal
government has cut back, the states have taken up the slack.''
   Ted Strickland, president of the national legislatures group,
agreed.
   ``Uncertainties in budgeting are growing and states must
continue to be cautious in their budget and revenue decisions,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Burma's most powerful leaders met today to
discuss a successor to Ne Win as chairman of the country's ruling
socialist party, sources said.
   The Central Committee of the Burma Socialist Program Party
gathered to choose successors to Ne Win and party Vice Chairman San
Yu, the country's two most powerful figures, the sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   The 77-year-old Ne Win, who came to power in a 1962 military
coup, announced abruptly Saturday that he was resigning. He cited
his age and violent anti-government rioting in March and June as
key factors in his decision.
   The Central Committee, elected in 1985, includes about 270
members and normally abides by decisions made by the party's most
powerful body _ the 15-member Central Executive Committee.
   The most senior member of the executive committee, party General
Secretary Aye Ko, is considered Ne Win's likely successor.
   No details of the meeting were available. It comes one day after
a special party congress concluded its meetings on sweeping reform
proposals.
   The three-day congress session ended Monday with a vaguely
worded announcement, possibly reflecting splits within the party
over the dramatic events of recent days.
   The official Radio Rangoon said delegates ``firmly suggested''
against a voter referendum on whether Burma's 26 years of one-party
rule should be replaced by a multi-party system.
   The rejection of Ne Win's recommendation for the referendum was
the first known time the party had not rubber-stamped his proposals.
   Some liberalization of the economy last year has failed to stop
Burma's downward spiral. Inflation is soaring, government stores
are virtually empty and the country is saddled with a foreign debt
of about $4 billion.

<HEAD>Delegation Leaves For Historic Visit To Moscow</HEAD>

   An Israeli delegation including two Soviet-born
Jews headed today for Moscow on the first such official trip in 21
years.
   The five Israelis will kick off their visit by attending Sabbath
prayers in a Moscow synagogue, where they hope to have a chance to
meet informally with Soviet Jews, said Soviet-born diplomat Meron
Gordon, who heads the group.
   In addition to Gordon, 41, who came to Israel at the age of 10,
the delegation includes Yaakov Kedmi, a former Soviet dissident
named Yasha Kazakov who came to Israel in the 1960s.
   ``We are both very moved,'' Gordon said on Israel Television.
``When we left there, we were young. I don't think either of us
ever thought we could return to the Soviet Union _ certainly not as
official representatives of Israel.''
   The delegates left for The Hague, where they are to pick up
two-month visas and then travel to Moscow on Thursday.
   The Soviet Union severed ties with Israel in 1967 after the Six
Day War to protest Israel's occupation of the territory captured
from three Arab countries.
   The two countries still have no official diplomatic relations,
but links between Moscow and Jerusalem have recently improved.
   In the summer of 1986, Israeli and Soviet delegates met in
Helsinki, Finland, for the first official session since 1967. Last
summer, a Soviet delegation arrived in Tel Aviv on two-month visas
that since have been extended.
   Before leaving from Ben Gurion International Airport, Gordon
told reporters the Israeli delegates would visit a Moscow synagogue
Friday evening for Sabbath prayers.
   The delegates, most of whom speak Russian, will work out of an
office in the Dutch Embassy, which represents Israeli interests in
the Soviet Union. One of their first jobs will be to inspect the
old Israeli Embassy building, Gordon said.
   The other delegates are Danny Megido, Gershon Gorev and Ehud
Balsar. Gorev's wife, Hasia, also is accompanying the team.

<HEAD>Hamadi Sent Postcard From Greece One Day Before Athens Hijacking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi sent a
postcard from Greece the day before the TWA airliner he is accused
of hijacking departed from Athens, according to evidence introduced
today.
   The postcard, introduced by prosecutors during Hamadi's trial on
air piracy and murder charges, was dated June 13, 1985, and had
been sent to the brother of Hamadi's West German girlfriend.
   TWA flight 847 was hijacked on June 14, 1985, and diverted to
Beirut, Lebanon, after it had departed Athens. A U.S. Navy diver
was fatally shot and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   The postcard was read by Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger at the
start of the fourth week of Hamadi's trial in a courtroom on a
Frankfurt prison compound on charges of hijacking, murder and
possession of explosives.
   The postcard, written in German, is addressed to Paul Mueller,
brother of Hamadi's former West German girlfriend, Birgit Mueller.
Hamadi lived in West Germany for two years until November 1984.
   The postcard carries a stamp June 13, 1985, and reads: ``I send
you this card after seven months because you are my friend and
brother. Take care of my daughter Lydia. Your brother Mohammed.''
   In the text, Hamadi purportedly wrote: ``Today is my birthday
and I am now in Greece.''
   Mueckenberger said the postcard was sent from Greece.
   Hamadi is being tried by a Frankfurt juvenile court, which is
attempting to determine his age at the time the TWA hijacking
began. Depending on the court's decision on the age issue, Hamadi
could receive a maximum prison sentence of 15 years as a young
adult, or life imprisonment as an adult if found guilty as charged.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, allegedly sent another
postcard dated June 11, 1985, to his girlfriend in the southern
West German town of Saarlouise.
   Mueckenberger said the stamp on the second postcard had been
torn off and it was not clear if the card had been sent from Greece
or Lebanon.
   The card says, ``To my Lydia, greetings from Lebanon and
Greece.''
   The postcards were introduced as evidence during testimony by
Lydia Mueller, mother of Paul and Birgit Mueller.
   Mrs. Mueller, 48, testified that Mohammed Hamadi had told the
family he was born on June 13, 1964, which would have made him 21
when the hijacking took place.
   Court records show Hamadi was born on June 13, 1964, but Hamadi
has said the year of his birth on official records was altered by
his father, making him ``one or two years older,'' to gain more
social support payments for his family in warn-torn Lebanon.
   Also scheduled to testify was the former wife of Hamadi's older
brother, 29-year-old Abbas Hamadi.
   A Duesseldorf court in April convicted Abbas Hamadi of
masterminding the Beirut kidnappings of two West Germans in an
attempt to gain the release of his brother. Abbas Hamadi was
sentenced to 13 years in prison.
   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13,
1987, after customs officials discovered bottles of liquid
explosives in his luggage.
   Shortly after his arrest, two West Germans, Rudolf Cordes and
Alfred Schmidt, were kidnapped in Beirut.
   Abbas Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 26, 1987,
after returning from Lebanon and charged with the abductions.
   Schmidt was released by his captors in September, but Cordes
remains a hostage.

<HEAD>Midnight Deadline Passes, Talks Continue In Writer's Strike</HEAD>

   Both sides refused to speculate on how
negotiations were going today in the 20-week-old writers strike
after a federal mediator stopped the clock on his own deadline,
keeping representatives at the bargaining table.
   ``The talks continue and the mediator is still present,''
Writers Guild of America spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said early
today. ``The mediator stopped the clock.'' Talks were supposed to
end at midnight.
   There was no comment on whether the two sides were nearing
agreement, as a news blackout was imposed by Leonard Farrell, the
federal mediator who ordered both sides to resume negotiations last
week.
   ``There's just no way to predict'' the outcome, Ms. Rhoden said.
   At the opening of contract talks Monday afternoon,
representatives of both the guild and the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers were told they had nine hours to
end their dispute.
   ``At 12 midnight, we're going to be through,'' said Floyd Wood,
district director for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, who imposed the deadline. ``I'm going to conclude the
negotiations at midnight.''
   Wood also said at time that the writers and producers were
making progress in the talks. ``Both sides are working hard,'' he
said.
   Guild sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the producers had made few concessions
in bargaining sessions Saturday and Sunday, which lasted 13 hours
each.
   However, there were reports on the guild's computer bulletin
board Monday that Farrell had threatened the producers with fines
for refusing to bargain at the commencement of talks Saturday. The
threat was confirmed by an independent guild source familiar with
the negotiations, who spoke anonymously.
   Adding pressure on the producers to settle was the Teamsters
union, which said its Hollywood members may strike next week. A
Teamsters strike could halt almost all film production in Hollywood
studios.
   ``I certainly hope we don't strike,'' said Earl Bush, secretary
treasurer of Teamsters Local 399. ``But there's always that
possibility when a contract expires.''
   The Teamsters contract with the producers expires Sunday at
midnight.
   At issue in the writers' strike, which began March 7, are
payments for one-hour television programs rebroadcast domestically
and all television shows rebroadcast overseas.
   The strike has delayed the fall television season and has led to
sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry.

<HEAD>North Korea Wants To Discuss Olympics Participation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea told South Korea in a
surprise letter today that it was willing to talk about entering
the Olympics in Seoul, but insisted again on discussing its demand
to co-host the Games, officials said.
   The North had said previously it would boycott the Sept. 17-Oct.
2 Games unless it was made a co-host. South Korea and the
International Olympic Committee have said some events could be held
in the North, but that the Games are awarded to a single host city
_ in this case Seoul _ and not to countries.
   Aides to Kim Chae-sun, speaker of South Korea's National
Assembly, said today's letter was from Yang Hyong Sop, chairman of
North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly. It was received at the
border truce village of Panmunjom, they added.
   As made public by the aides, the letter said, ``We are willing
to discuss the issue of our participation in the Olympics as
demanded by your side.''
   The letter came as South Korea was considering its response to
an earlier North Korean letter proposing parliamentary talks on a
non-aggression pact between the two rivals, split since 1945 into
the communist North and capitalist South. They fought a bloody war
in 1950-53.
   The new North Korean letter said, ``We propose with courtesy
that the scheduled North-South joint parliamentary conference be
held within August at the latest before the opening of the Olympics
and discuss as an urgent agenda such issues as your request for our
participation in the Olympics and our proposal for its co-hosting.''
   The South Korean government had no immediate comment.
   The IOC has said North Korea could stage archery, table tennis,
women's volleyball, preliminary soccer games and a cycling road
race. The North has insisted on more, including its own set of
opening and closing ceremonies in Pyongyang and a share of
television revenue.
   Seoul Olympic officials have said the offer to the North would
be kept open until the last possible moment in hopes of promoting
North-South reconciliation.
   South Korea's political leaders had been working to solve
differences among themselves before sending a unified response on
Monday next week to the North's earlier letter.
   South Korean government officials have been reluctant to agree
to immediate full-scale parliamentary talks, saying preliminary
negotiations are needed for such conferences.
   North Korea is one of only six countries that have not accepted
invitations to the Olympics in Seoul. The others are Cuba,
Ethiopia, Albania, Nicaragua and the Seychelles.
   A record 12,000 athletes from 161 nations are expected to
compete in the Games. The 161 include North Korean allies China and
the Soviet Union, which have no diplomatic relations with South
Korea.

<HEAD>Conviction Overturned in Cable Franchise Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An appeals court has overturned the conviction
of a public relations man accused of collaborating with the late
Queens Borough President Donald Manes in soliciting a bribe for the
awarding of a cable television franchise.
   The Appellate Division of State Supreme Court on Monday
overturned the indictment, conviction and sentence of Michael A.
Nussbaum, a political associate of Manes and one-time aide to
former Mayor John Lindsay.
   Nussbaum, 40, was convicted Aug. 7, 1987, of collaborating with
Manes in soliciting a $250,000 bribe from Al Simon, president of
Orth-O-Vision Inc., in 1981, when the company was competing for a
cable television franchise in Queens. The prosecution said Simon
refused to pay. His company did not win the franchise.
   Nussbaum, who had worked on Gov. Mario Cuomo's 1982 campaign,
was sentenced to one to three years in prison.
   In its ruling Monday, the four-judge appeals panel said it
``agreed with the defendant's contention that the evidence adduced
was legally insufficient to support his conviction.''
   Nussbaum's lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin, said Nussbaum was
``grateful and relieved'' and determined to ``get on with his
life.''
   Nussbaum was free without bail pending the appeal, living in
Queens and working as a sales consultant.
   Nussbaum's was one of three trials that stemmed from
investigations into the awarding of cable franchises in Queens.
   In another of the cases, real-estate developer John Zaccaro, the
husband of former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro, was acquitted last October of working with Manes to extort
a bribe for the awarding of a cable franchise.
   In the third case, former Queens Administrative Judge Francis X.
Smith was convicted in July 1987 of perjury and criminal contempt.
He was sentenced to one year in jail but has remained free on bail
while an appeal is being prepared.
   Manes fatally stabbed himself in the heart in March 1986 as word
of the indictments leaked out.

   A special administrative council
dominated by Gurkhas will be set up in West Bengal state as part of
a plan to end a separatist war by Gurkha militants, the government
says.
   The council will administer 1,080 square miles in the
tea-growing Darjeeling district of West Bengal.More than 1.4
million Gurkhas, who are Indians of Nepalese descent, live in the
area.
   S. Narendra, a spokesman for the Home Ministry, said the
decision was made at a meeting between Home Minister Buta Singh,
West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu and Gurkha leader Subhas
Ghising.
   The three met at Singh's residence in New Delhi. The Home
Ministry is responsible for Indian internal security.
   ``The Darjeeling Gurkha Hill Council will be set up as soon as
practicable,'' Narendra said. He estimated it would take about
three months.
   ``A final agreement will be signed at Calcutta very soon,'' he
added. Calcutta is the capital of West Bengal state.
   Militant Gurkhas launched an campaign for a separate state
within the Indian union in May 1986, claiming their cultural and
social identity was being swamped by migrants from other parts of
West Bengal.
   More than 300 people have been killed in attacks by the
militants. Most of the deaths have occurred in the Darjeeling
district, known for its tea and breath-taking views of the Himalaya
mountains.
   The separatist campaign was suspended at the end of June after
Ghising held discussions with Singh and Basu, where the creation of
the hill council was agreed to in principle.
   A sticking point, the inclusion of the word ``Gurkha'' in its
title, apparently was resolved at Monday's meeting.
   Sunday, a weekly news magazine, reported earlier that the
council would be responsible for land allotment, tourism, public
works, health and education.
   It will be made up of 42 members, with 30 to be elected and the
rest named by local legislators, the magazine said.
   Narendra said the council would be set up after the proposal
received the sanction of the West Bengal legislature and plans for
the elections were worked out.
   An estimated six million Gurkhas reside in India.

   A dummy round kept an automatic pistol
from firing when Benjamin Crewshaw pointed the gun at a friend and
pulled the trigger.
   ``OK, shoot me,'' Donald Glen Mora, 23, told his friend, said
Sgt. Lee Wasdin of the Escambia County Sheriff's Department.
   Crewshaw, 25, pulled back the slide on the gun and it ejected
the dummy round. When he pulled the trigger again, a live bullet
fired, hitting Mora in the lower right chest, killing him, Wasdin
said Monday.
   ``He had forgotten he had a loaded clip in the gun behind the
dummy round,'' Wasdin said.
   Crewshaw had bought the dummy round, a safety extender, barrel
extender and a cleaning rod at the Pensacola Gun and Knife Show at
Bayfront Auditorium on Sunday.
   ``When he put the barrel extender on, the weapon was not sliding
properly, so he was examining it to see what was wrong with it,''
Wasdin said.
   At that point, Mora and two friends showed up at Crewshaw's
door, asking to borrow a part for a car. While they were talking,
Crewshaw aimed the .45 caliber automatic at Mora, Wasdin said.
   The shooting, although considered accidental, remains under
investigation, Wasdin said. No charges have been filed.

   The body of a man found shot four times
in the head has been identified as that of a former Texas
schoolteacher wanted on kidnapping and drug smuggling charges,
police say.
   Juan Francisco ``Frank'' Garcia, 38, his head wrapped in a gauze
bandage and his hands tied behind his back, was found dead in the
back seat of an abandoned car shortly after midnight Saturday, said
Hernan Guajardo, state judicial police director.
   Guajardo said the body was identified through fingerprints sent
from federal authorities in Texas. The body was found by municipal
police in Guadalupe, a suburb of Monterrey.
   In a news conference Monday, Guajardo described Garcia as a
``person dedicated to narcotics trafficking on a grand scale.'' He
said Garcia had been sought in the United States since the early
1980s.
   Garcia taught elementary history in the Donna Independent School
District for two years in the early 1970s. He also taught migrant
students in Edinburg, Texas, according to records kept by the
Edinburg Daily Review newspaper.
   Garcia failed to appear in Hidalgo County Court in Edinburg in
1984 on a charge of kidnapping. The case involved the abduction of
a South Texas couple taken to Dallas and tortured in an attempt to
find more than $500,000 in gold coins Garcia believed had been
taken from him, according to the Daily Review.
   Garcia also is wanted on a federal indictment in Houston in 1985
charging him with involvement in a narcotics smuggling ring.
   That so-called ``Cash Crop'' indictment alleged that Garcia and
43 other people were involved in smuggling about 250,000 pounds of
marijuana from Mexico into the United States.

allowed to return without being prosecuted, the Los Angeles Times
reported today.
   A Marcos spokesman in Hawaii called the report of the offer
absurd.
   The offer is part of a package being pursued by Marcos aides
that includes a pledge to promote national reconciliation in the
Philippines if he isn't charged with wrongdoing in the United
States, the newspaper said.
   ``If there is no indictment, he will support the government of
the Philippines,'' said Col. Arturo Aruiza at Marcos' Honolulu home
in exile. ``There will be a national reconciliation.''
   Representatives of Marcos are talking with Philippine officials,
including Mrs. Aquino's brother Jose Cojuangco and Philippine
Ambassador to the United States Emmanuel Peleaz, trying to work out
the $5 billion deal, according to A. James Gregor, a University of
California, Berkeley, political science professor.
   Gregor, who has been in direct contact with the Marcos camp in
Hawaii, and with U.S. officials in Washington, D.C., said Marcos
has agreed to stay out of Filipino politics, stay out of the
capital Manila and support Mrs. Aquino if he is allowed to return.
   But the ousted ruler, accused of siphoning billions of dollars
from the national treasury during his tenure as president, has
asked that his son Ferdinand Marcos Jr. be allowed to run for
political office, perhaps for governor of the family's home
province of Ilocos Norte, Gregor said.
   Asked about the $5 billion offer, Pelaez said, ``You have long
ears. ... I'm not sure whether I can talk about it or not. I'd
rather you didn't ask me.''
   Marcos' spokesman in Honolulu, Gemmo Trinidad, however, quoted
Marcos as saying the report about a $5 billion offer ``is totally
absurd.''
   ``The president (Marcos) told me negotiations are going on, but
they do not involve any money,'' Trinidad told The Associated
Press. He said he was not privy to information on who was
particating in the negotiations.
   Estimates of the amount of money allegedly diverted from the
Philippine treasury by Marcos and his associates range from $1
billion to $10 billion.
   The $5 billion offer was so high it reportedly caught Philippine
officials by surprise and raised suspicions as to how much money he
may have put away.
   ``That's why the negotiations haven't been easy,'' Gregor said.
``Everyone (in the Philippines) is saying, `If he's got $5 billion,
maybe he's got $40 billion.''
   In the two years since the revolution that led to Marcos' flight
to Hawaii, Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly said he couldn't return to
the Philippines.
   But recently she has softened that position, saying Marcos could
return if he agreed to stand trial.
   Federal officials in New York City have recommended that Marcos
be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges stemming from his
alleged use of Philippine government funds to buy art and real
estate in the United States while concealing their ownership.
   In Manila, Quintin Doromal, an official of the Presidential
Commission on Good Government, said he was unaware of the offer.
The commission is responsible for tracking down and recovering
money Marcos allegedly stole during his 20 years in office.
   ``I don't think the commission knows anything about it,''
Doromal said. ``If there is such a thing, we would know something
about it but it's zero, no information along that line.''

<HEAD>PTL Will Auction Gifts That Were Stored in Vault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appraiser will begin setting prices
today on gifts by PTL contributors _ ranging from old coins to fur
coats _ that were stashed in a vault at Heritage USA.
   PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said the items, which
supporters donated over a 10-year period, will be auctioned early
next month to raise money for the ailing television ministry.
   ``I don't know of a more critical time to use these gifts than
right now as we try to undergo the reorganization,'' Benton told a
reporter Monday, as he examined a bag of coins taken from a
15-by-16-foot vault at the World Outreach Center.
   Although the vault looked like any other storage closet,
valuable coins and dollars were found in some file cabinets and
stamps were organized in books or piled in envelopes. Furs were
strewn across some cartons.
   The ministry hasn't determined the value of the items, but
Benton's administrative assistant, Wally Stalnaker, said he was
told one stamp book was worth $28,000 to $30,000.
   ``We can't answer the value of what we have until the
appraisal's made, but some of these dollars in there are worth $100
or more,'' he said.
   Many of the furs that had been in the vault were sold at earlier
auctions, he said.
   ``The partners send it in just to help support the ministry,''
said Delores Jones, supervisor of cash management, as she reached
for gold bank notes and a bag of coins, some of them dating to 1853.
   Besides auctioning the valuables, ministry officials expect to
auction cars, trucks, a train, heavy equipment, some motor homes
and a boat that had been used at Heritage Lake.

   A woman walking to her car in the
parking lot of a bank thought it was a joke when an 8-year-old told
her to hand over her money or he'd kill her.
   When she refused, the youngster flashed a knife. She ran to her
van. He threw the knife at her as she drove off.
   ``I just thought it was a kid messing around, so I told him to
beat it,'' said Sandra Lamusta. ``Then he pulled out a knife, and I
took him seriously.''
   Ms. Lamusta drove to a nearby convenience store and called
police, who arrested the boy and a 12-year-old friend a short time
later.
   The two boys were charged with attempted armed robbery, said Lt.
F.M. Adams. Police could not release the suspects' names because
they are juveniles.
   ``It's sort of discouraging to think that our society has gotten
that bad,'' said Adams. ``It tells me our whole system is out of
whack.''
   Ms. Lamusta, a mother of three adult children, said she could
not believe it either. ``Kids do strange things,'' she said. ``It
upset me.''
   Ms. Lamusta told police she had seen the boys sitting under a
tree when she first pulled up at the bank.
   ``It's a busy intersection there,'' she said. ``It never
occurred to me that anyone would be up to any shenanigans.''

   Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk today rejected the Vietnamese-installed
government's latest peace plan, but said he was willing to meet
with Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   The warring Cambodian factions today met for a second day of
informal talks at the Dutch colonial summer palace of Indonesia's
late President Sukarno at Bogor, about 35 miles outside Jakarta.
   Sihanouk resigned July 10 as president of the guerrilla
coalition fighting the government and Vietnamese troops in
Cambodia. He is widely considered central to any settlement in the
9{ year civil war, but vowed he would not attend the peace talks
that began Monday.
   The talks bring together Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia and
the leaders of the three resistance groups _ Khieu Samphan of the
Communist Khmer Rouge, Son Sann of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who represents his
father, Sihanouk.
   In a meeting today with Japan's ambassador in Jakarta, Sihanouk
rejected a seven-point plan proposed by Hun Sen as an old proposal
aimed at preserving the current Phnom Penh government, Japanese
reporters said.
   Sihanouk told Ambassador Sumio Edamura that he was willing to
attend talks in Jakarta's presidential palace Wednesday with Hun
Sen and Sihanouk's guerrilla coalition partners, Khieu Samphan of
the Khmer Rouge and Son Sann of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front.
   Sihanouk said he would make ``a very important speech'' then,
according to the Japanese journalists. Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia
from 1941 to 1970, also said he would meet with President Suharto
of Indonesia at a dinner Wednesday.
   Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, who organized the
talks today and Monday, said the atmosphere at Monday's session was
good and that the talks would last ``as long as it takes.'' He said
the Cambodian factions agreed on the need for a new coalition
government and a neutral, non-aligned Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and has more than 100,000
troops there supporting the Hun Sen government. Vietnam met the
guerrillas for the first time ever during the talks Monday.
   Officials said the Cambodians previously have agreed that an
early political settlement is necessary, that a new coalition
government must be formed and Cambodia must become a neutral and
non-aligned nation.
   But Hun Sen told reporters he and the guerrilla leaders resolved
no concrete problems Monday. He presented at the talks a
seven-point peace plan containing proposals already rejected by the
guerrillas.
   The plan said that before elections for a new government, the
status quo must be maintained _ defying guerrilla demands that Hun
Sen's government be dismantled before elections.
   In one new move, Hun Sen said that in order to bridge this
dispute he was proposing formation of a ``national reconciliation
council'' headed by Sihanouk to implement any peace agreements and
organize elections.
   The plan also repeated demands for elimination of the Khmer
Rouge leadership, and dissolution of its army, the largest of the
guerrilla forces. Only this, Hun Sen said, would ensure the Khmer
Rouge cannot return to power.
   From 1975 until Vietnam invaded, the fanatical Khmer Rouge
regime killed hundreds of thousands of people in Cambodia and
launched bloody attacks on Vietnam's western border.
   Diplomats in Thailand say the Khmer Rouge is storing arms for
all-out attacks when Vietnam withdraws all its troops by 1990, as
it has pledged.
   However, China, which arms the guerrillas, recently indicated it
was prepared to lessen its once-unequivocal support for the Khmer
Rouge and said it supported a government in which the group would
not have a dominant role.

   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods,
propelled by a big jump in aircraft orders, increased 8.8 percent
in June, the largest advance in 42 months, the government reported
today.
   The Commerce Department said orders totaled $125.23 billion last
month, an increase of $10.14 billion over the May figure.
   Virtually all of the gain reflected a big jump in orders for
aircraft. The transportation category shot up 35.5 percent to
$38.24 billion last month.
   Without this gain, total orders would have risen only 0.1
percent, the government said.
   The big increase in total orders had been expected because of
announcements by the Seattle-based Boeing Co. of a string of giant
orders for commercial aircraft in recent weeks.
   Those orders have totaled $8 billion. But the report said that
demand for commerical aircraft rose by about $3 billion, indicating
that the rest of the Boeing orders will show up in coming months.
   The overall increase of 8.8 percent was the largest single-month
gain since an 8.9 percent increase in December 1985, also a month
when the orders report was propelled by a big jump in the
transportation category.
   While there have been concerns that high factory operating rates
would contribute to inflationary pressures, economists said they
were not too alarmed by the big jump in manufacturing orders in
June since it was contained in one industry.
   The 0.1 percent rise in demand excluding the transportation
category was slightly below expectations.
   The overall increase of 8.8 percent followed a 1.9 percent drop
in May which had been the biggest setback since last August.
   Manufacturing has been one of the top performers of the economy
this year as U.S. companies have benefited from rising export
demand.
   The 35.5 percent jump in transportation orders was the biggest
increase since a 45.3 percent rise in December 1985. In addition to
the strong gain in aircraft, the shipbuilding and tanks categories
also reflected big increases as the military stepped up its orders.
   The total defense category showed a gain of 88.6 percent last
month, the biggest advance since a 123.2 percent rise in December
1982.
   The category of non-defense capital goods posted a 9.8 percent
increase to $34.57 billion with the $3.1 billion increase
reflecting the rise in commercial aircraft orders.
   Orders for electrical machinery were up for the third
consecutive month with the June increase a 0.6 percent advance to
$20.3 billion. Orders for non-electrical machinery rose 1.3 percent
to $20.8 billion.
   Orders for primary metals fell 3.5 percent to $411.5 billion.
This was the first decline since January.
   Shipments of durable goods rose 1.5 percent to $116.3 billion in
June following a 1.8 percent increase in May.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Angry Mourners At Funeral of Christian Arab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Palestinian mourners shook their
fists and chanted anti-Israeli slogans today at a memorial service
for a Christian Arab killed by Israeli troops.
   Jeris Kunkar, 40, a tailor from the town of Beit Jalla near the
biblical city of Bethlehem, was hit by three bullets during
anti-Israeli protests Sunday.
   The army said Kunkar was shot accidentally when a soldier
chasing Arab stone-throwers stumbled and his gun discharged.
Palestinians said Kunkar was not involved in the violence and
happened to step out of his house when he was hit by bullets.
   Mourners today decked the Kunkar home with outlawed Palestinian
flags and chanted, ``With our spirit and blood, we will avenge the
martyr'' as church bells pealed in the background.
   The army stayed away from Beit Jalla during the service, Israel
radio said.
   Kunkar was the third Christian Arab to die over the past 10 days
and the fourth since the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied
teritories began last Dec. 8.
   A total of 233 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed.
   The deaths of Christian Arabs have heightened anti-Israeli
sentiment among West Bank Christians, considered more moderate than
their Moslem brethren.
   In the West Bank city of Hebron, a small home-made bomb exploded
today in the outdoor market but did not cause damage or injuries,
an army spokeswoman said. She said soldiers closed off the area and
carried out searches.
   In another development, the army asked the Foreign Ministry to
lodge a complaint against Belgium's consul in Jerusalem, Roger
Dewulf. The army charged Dewulf spat at Israeli soldiers guarding a
Palestinian prisoner and knocked away one soldier's hand.
   An army spokeswoman said the incident occurred last week outside
the military government building in Bethlehem.
   A Foreign Ministry official said the matter would be
investigated. He told The Associated Press that Dewulf acknowledged
giving the soldiers a disapproving look, but denied spitting at
them.
   Officials at the Belgian Consulate refused comment and referred
queries to the Foreign Ministry in Brussels.

   The government announced it will stop funding
research into the development of a space plane because the project
is too expensive for Britain.
   Instead, the plane is to be developed internationally as a joint
venture between two British companies _ Rolls Royce PLC and British
Aerospace PLC _ and foreign partners, former Trade and Industry
Minister Kenneth Clarke said Monday. Clarke, who did not name the
foreign partners, was appointed health secretary after making the
announcement.
   The Hotol _ or horizontal take-off and landing _ project is
aimed at developing an unmanned, reusable spacecraft capable of
operating like a conventional plane. Its supporters believe it
could put a satellite into orbit more cheaply than the U.S. space
shuttle.
   Clarke said the government had funded about half the $5.2
million cost of a research study on the Hotol's commercial and
technical viability, completed earlier this year by the two British
companies.

   It's all in the nose, a doctor told a man
afflicted by attacks of sneezing after lovemaking.
   A nose spray recommended by a California doctor in a
question-and-answer section of the Journal of the American Medical
Association has given a 60-year-old man relief and should clear up
his problems, his family doctor said.
   ``He would have four to five sneezes starting at about one
minute after. As soon as they finished lovemaking, his wife would
run and get a box of Kleenex,'' said Dr. William H. Hunter of his
60-year-old patient, who had what appeared to be an allergy for
about two years.
   In describing the man's symptoms in JAMA, Hunter wrote, ``This
is the most unusual problem I have ever been presented with by a
patient.''
   The sneezing is probably due to a condition called vasomotor
rhinitis, ``a fairly common syndrome'' in which the nasal passages
are chronically swollen, responded Dr. Jeffrey A. Wald of San Diego
in last week's issue of the journal.
   The swelling of the tissue inside the nose leads to an increase
in secretions, which probably trigger the sneezing, Wald said.
   ``Somehow the AMA always finds an answer, no matter how obscure
the problem,'' said Hunter, a past president of the South Carolina
Medical Association.

   The Williamsburg Bridge, which caused commuter
misery for three months while under repair, was fully opened to
traffic today for the first time in three months.
   ``The bridge is now stronger than it's been since World War
II,'' said Transportation Commissioner Ross Sandler as he watched
the first cars roll over the last four lanes that had been closed.
   The rusting 85-year-old span was closed April 12; two lanes for
motorists traveling from Manhattan to Brooklyn were opened in May
and another two in June. Subway service was also restored in June.
   The opening of all lanes this morning came two weeks ahead of
schedule. Brooklyn-bound trucks remain forbidden, but should be
allowed on the bridge come mid-August, Sandler said.
   Work was done on what Sandler called an emergency contract
basis, which meant workers labored seven days a week to add 150
tons of steel to the bridge. He said the total cost was just under
$10 million.
   ``We did a five-year job in three months,'' said Deputy
Transportation Commissioner Samuel Schwartz.
   An estimated 107,000 vehicles and 420 subway trains crossed the
bridge each day before its closure. The closure tied up traffic in
southern Manhattan and Brooklyn, added to problems throughout the
city and forced the city Transit Authority to reroute trains.

   Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh says
Oliver North is trying to turn his trial from a criminal to a
political one and should not be allowed to use politics to win a
six-month delay.
   Walsh urged U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell on Monday to
reject North's motion for a delay until after the presidential
election.
   ``Having failed in several attempts to avoid completely the
trial of this case, while proclaiming his innocence in speeches,
the defendant Oliver L. North is now grasping at the criminal
defendant's maneuver of last resort _ delay,'' Walsh said.
   ``This trial in particular should not be held hostage to a media
which the defendant himself has strenuously sought to inflame,''
Walsh said in a brief filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell.
   Walsh also rebutted North's contention that his actions had been
approved.
   ``The government knows of no presidential decision that North
can point to as authorizing his activities,'' Walsh said, adding:
   ``The government also is not aware of any superior, except
North's co-conspirators (Robert C.) McFarlane and (John M.)
Poindexter, who knew enough about North's activities to have
conveyed even informal or implicit approval.''
   Had Walsh found Reagan responsible for authorizing North's
activities, the prosecutor would have been unable to charge North
in March with defrauding the United States because North would have
been acting with the necessary presidential approval.
   The prosecutor included 15 newspaper clippings reporting North's
recent speeches about his case and in support of Republican
congressional candidates. He quoted North's own statement after his
indictment last March: ``I have now been caught in a bitter dispute
between the Congress and the president over the control of foreign
policy. ... It is a shame that the new battleground for such a
fight will be a courtroom.''
   Delaying the trial would give court approval to ``North's
transparent attempt to transform this trial from a criminal into a
political one,'' Walsh argued.
   A retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel and former White House
aide, North is the first of four defendants scheduled to be tried
on charges including a conspiracy to defraud the United States by
illegally diverting profits from U.S.-Iran arms sales to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Last Wednesday, one of North's attorneys, Barry Simon, told the
court that `no fair-minded person could argue that this trial
should be started seven weeks prior to the presidential election.
The intense publicity generated during the final seven weeks of a
presidential campaign would deny (North) a fair trial.''
   But Walsh said, ``To the extent that North's trial may become a
political issue in the upcoming elections, North bears at least a
substantial measure of responsibility, and therefore has little
credibility in complaining.'' Walsh said North has made many
pretrial speeches and statements ``in which he had claimed that the
charges should be evaluated in a political context.''
   Walsh said North's trial could begin Sept. 20 as planned with an
impartial jury despite the presidential campaign and urged Gesell
to reject North's motion for a six-month delay, which Walsh said
was filed ``simply as a stalling tactic.''
   Walsh said courts in the District of Columbia are well trained
by their experience with Watergate and other political scandals to
conduct trials in cases which receive a lot of publicity. He said
the trial would draw media attention no matter when it occurred and
that much of this publicity has been favorable to the defendants.
   Of the 16 counts against North, Walsh said those involving false
statements and obstruction of justice, personal enrichment and tax
fraud could easily be tried Sept. 20.
   To meet that date for the conspiracy, theft of government
property and wire fraud charges, Walsh said Gesell would have to
modify a July 6 order granting North access to additional
classified documents.
   Walsh enclosed a letter from CIA general counsel Russell J.
Bruemmer to support such a modification. Bruemmer said some of the
documents already had been provided, others including excepts from
the President's Daily Brief on intelligence matters, and summaries
by the Central American Joint Intelligence Task Force could be
ready in four weeks, but others are not readily available and would
require several months to gather.
   Walsh noted that Gesell ordered the documents on the basis of a
meeting with defense lawyers from which prosecutors were excluded.
   Walsh said no defense argument he could envision would make the
documents relevant to the case. He indicated that most of them
refer to other government covert actions abroad and said no other
covert action had ever involved the transfer of funds from one
operation to another.
   Walsh asked Gesell to require North to come up with more
specific reasons for seeing items before they are ordered turned
over to him.
   Gesell did not rule on the motion immediately.

   Eastbound motorists on Interstate 64 are
being forced to take a six-mile detour only 10 days after officials
opened the last link in a continuous highway from Virginia to St.
Louis.
   Structural problems on a bridge between Kenova and Huntington
forced highway workers to close the lanes for at least 10 days,
Highway Department spokeswoman Carol Melling said. District
Engineer Sam Beverage said the bridge had a 4-inch gap.
   On July 15, Gov. Arch Moore and other top state officials had
opened of the final 36-mile stretch of I-64 between Beckley and Sam
Black Church in southeast West Virginia.
   The link completed 1,125 miles of continuous four-lane road from
Norfolk, Va., to St. Louis on I-64, through Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia. The highway had been under
construction in West Virginia since the early 1960s.
   The closed span at Twelvepole Creek, near the Kentucky border,
is one of the oldest sections of I-64 in West Virginia and is not
part of the section just opened.
   Beverage said engineers spotted cracks last Wednesday and said
the gap had expanded to 4 inches by Sunday night.

   Gunmen in a speeding car shot and
killed a U.S. Air Force sergeant while he was jogging with his dogs
in a neighborhood near Clark Air Base, police said today.
   In a separate incident, U.S. Navy authorities said the Filipino
wife of an American serviceman was robbed and slain Sunday night
near the base, located 50 miles north of the capital Manila.
   Police said both incidents appeared to be criminal and not
related to the 19-year communist insurgency. Communist rebels
operate in the Angeles area and have threatened to attack American
military personnel.
   News of the killings came as talks between the Philippines and
the United States over U.S. bases here broke down over
compensation. The rift was expected to fuel Filipino sentiment
against the bases.
   Mary Carlin Yates, a member of U.S. panel in the talks,
described the suspension as a ``temporary break in the talks.'' But
the chief Filipino negotiator said the two sides were so far apart
he doubted talks could resume.
   Police said Tech. Sgt. Richard Blackmer, 31, of the Cleveland
suburb of Brook Park, was jogging near his home in the Mountain
View subdivision about 9:30 p.m. Monday when gunmen opened fire
with M-16 rifles. His home is about one mile from the base's main
gate.
   The assailants also killed his two German shepherd dogs, police
added.
   Police officers who spoke on condition of anonymity said a
preliminary investigation indicated the killing may have been the
result of a marital dispute.
   They said Blackmer was estranged from his Filipino wife and was
living with another woman. Police picked up the wife, Maria, for
questioning late Monday but said no charges had been filed.
   Blackmer was the first American service member slain in the
Philippines since October, when communist rebels killed two Air
Force enlisted men, a retired Air Force sergeant and a Filipino
civilian of U.S. ancestry.
   But a Filipino investigator, who also requested anonymity, said
the style of the killing and weapons used did not fit the pattern
of guerrilla atacks.
   Rebel assassination teams normally use .45-caliber pistols and
fire at close range, he said.
   In the other incident, U.S. officials said Esther Billa Heacox,
41, wife of Navy Petty Officer James A. Heacox, was found fatally
stabbed late Sunday about three miles north of Clark Air Base.
   Master Sgt. James Katzman of the Clark Public Affairs Office
said Mrs. Heacox's body was found in the car after witnesses saw
the vehicle run off the road and two Filipino males flee.
   Her husband, assigned to a Navy communications station in nearby
Arlac province, said the victim left their home to drive Clark and
was carrying about $150, which was missing.
   A base spokeswoman, Air Force Capt. Maryellen Jadick, said U.S.
authorities had not imposed any new retrictions on the nearly
26,000 American troops, Defense Department civilians and dependents
living in this city of some 200,000.
   Nearly 40 people have been killed in Angeles and other
communities around Clark Air Base this year. Police say many of the
slayings are politically motivated.
   Communist rebels have been fighting to overthrow the Philippine
government since 1969.
   In December last year, an assistant U.S. defense secretary for
East Asia, Karl D. Jackson, said the Pentagon was taking steps to
protect the 8,000 U.S. servicemen stationed at Clark and 6,000
uniformed personnel at the Subic Bay Naval Base. They are the two
largest American military installations outside the United States.
   Jackson said measures included tighter security on the bases,
reductions in off-base leaves, anti-terrorist training for
servicemen, reduction in travel to the bases and increased police
patrol in the city outside Clark.
   Philippine officials have agreed to improve security, but no
details have been announced.
   About 40,000 U.S. servicemen, civilian personnel and dependents
live near Clark, Subic Bay and four smaller U.S. military
installations.

   A passenger train collided with a
locomotive engine in suburban Brussels today, injuring 30 people,
officials said.
   Some passengers suffered broken bones, according to Louis
Gillieaux, a spokesman for the Belgian railways. He said most
injuries were minor.
   The train from Brussels hit the side of the locomotive at 10:30
a.m. just outside the station of Braine-Le-Compte, about 6 miles
south of Brussels.
   ``The locomotive was somewhere where it should not have been,''
said Hugo Van Herle, another railway spokesman.

<HEAD>Zoo Plans Unprecedented Effort to Save Expected Panda Cub</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA M. HAMM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of the National Zoo, where four
panda cubs have been stillborn or died shortly after birth, said
today an unprecedented technological effort is planned to save the
expected offspring of female giant panda Ling-Ling.
   ``We're, in fact, taking a step that's altogether unprecedented,
but really on the best medical advice,'' said Dr. Michael Robinson,
the zoo's director, in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning
America''.
   Ling-Ling, who lives with her mate Hsing-Hsing in the zoo's
Panda House, gave birth to three stillborn cubs before giving birth
to a live cub last year. Zoo employees' hopes were raised when that
baby was born apparently healthy and screaming lustily, but the cub
died four days later.
   ``What happened last year is that the baby had no immune
system,'' said Robinson. ``When we did the autopsy, (we found)
there were no immunoglobulins in the baby's blood. And that means
that it had no protection against any kind of bacteria that it
could encounter in the world around it.''
   Robinson said zoo officials, who in the past have not intervened
with panda births for fear of alienating the mother from her baby,
will be aggressive from the start this year. They believe the
female panda will give birth this weekend or early next week.
   ``We're going to remove the baby from the mother and inject it
with immunoglobulins we've extracted from his (Hsing-Hsing's)
blood, and hope that that will confer a greater immunity than the
last one had,'' Robinson said.
   ``We're going to be extraordinarily careful about that, of
course,'' he added. ``The baby will be removed by our veterinarians
wearing surgical gloves and gowns and masks in the usual way, so it
shouldn't acquire any human odor. And we will treat it before we
return it to Ling-Ling with materials from the mother so that it
acquires her odor.''
   Zoo offiicals believe Ling-Ling is pregnant because she mated
with Hsing-Hsing three times in April during her brief annual
period of fertility, according to Robinson. He said her hormone
levels are similar to those she displayed at this stage in her
pregnancy last year.
   Zoo officials believe the 19-year-old Ling-Ling is nearing the
end of her childbearing years.
   Nobody knows how many years pandas are fertile, Robinson said.
``The estimates are between 19 and 23 or 24 years. But there are no
good longevity records on pandas from anywhere in the world, so
that's just `guess-timating'.''
   Only about 1,000 of the endangered giant pandas are alive in the
world today, including just 14 outside of China.

<HEAD>Philippines Breaks Off Talks Over Bases, Citing Compensation Gap</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Philippines broke off talks today
with the United States on U.S. military bases and Foreign Secretary
Raul Manglapus said differences over compensation were so wide he
doubted the talks could be revived.
   Manglapus made the remark to reporters after a meeting with
President Corazon Aquino during which he informed her the nearly
4-month-old talks were suspended indefinitely.
   ``I don't know whether the talks can resume ... but right now,
our positions are so far apart that I don't think we can resume,''
he said.
   Manglapus, head of the Philippine panel in the negotiations,
said Mrs. Aquino ``realizes that our position is a reasonable one
and that we should stick to it.'' He declined to elaborate, saying
revealing more details could create more difficulties.
   The Manila government is pressing for an increase in the $180
million it receives annually from Washington for use of the bases.
Before the talks began, Manglapus said $1.2 billion annually would
be ``more realistic.''
   The talks are held every five years to review terms of the 1947
agreement allowing the United States to maintain Clark Air Base,
Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations.
   U.S. spokeswoman Mary Carlin Yates told The Associated Press in
a telephone interview the break was temporary and the U.S. side,
headed by Ambassador Nicholas Platt, expects the talks to resume
``shortly.''
   She denied the U.S. panel approved a statement that Filipino
spokesman Leonides Caday described as a joint statement and read to
reporters. It said: ``There was a substantial disagreement on the
compensation issue, as a result of which the (Philippine) panel
moved for the suspension of the talks.''
   ``As has happened several times in the past, there has been a
temporary break in the talks,'' Mrs. Yates said. ``We do not
consider the talks suspended. Such temporary breaks occur from time
to time particularly when one side needs time to consider a
proposal from the other.''
   During previous interruptions, however, neither side had
described the talks as ``suspended.'' In previous instances,
spokesmen for both sides said talks had been temporarily recessed
because of foreign travel by negotiators or to allow time to study
proposals.
   On Monday, Manglapus said that the two panels were nearing
agreement but that they may not complete the negotiations by an
end-of-the-month deadline. The talks had initially been scheduled
to end during the first week of July.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz has said the United States
did not oppose an increase in compensation but would not agree to
paying any ``staggering amount.''
   The talks do not directly affect the status of the bases after
1991, but a successful review is widely expected to influence
Manila's decision on whether to extend the agreement. Mrs. Aquino
has refused to reveal her position.
   Meanwhile, the communist-led National Democratic Front, accused
Mrs. Aquino maneuvering for ``an impending sell-out of our national
sovereignty and interests.''
   The front, an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist rebel groups,
said in a statement delivered to news agencies by courier that the
Aquino administration ``has actually agreed to retain the bases
beyond (1991) in exchange for U.S. assurance of its survival.''

<HEAD>USIA Hints U.S. Will Abandon Cultural Exchange Treaty Over Court
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States may abandon an
international cultural exchange agreement if it loses a court
battle with documentary filmmakers over allegations of censorship,
a federal official suggested in a court filing.
   The threat by Charles Z. Wick, director of the United States
Information Agency, is the latest development in a battle over
allegations the agency has hampered international distribution of
documentaries with liberal themes.
   Movies that are certified by the USIA as being of an
educational, scientific or cultural nature are exempt from import
duties in some 60 countries under a 40-year-old international
treaty known as the Beirut Agreement.
   The suit, filed in December 1985 on behalf of makers of movies
on subjects ranging from Nicaragua to nuclear power, accuses the
USIA of, in effect, censoring the work of liberal moviemakers by
making it more expensive to export their work.
   Two courts have sided with the moviemakers, ordering the USIA to
rewrite its rules for determining whether a movie is of an
educational, scientific or cultural nature.
   If the government fails to get the rulings reversed, Wick said
in a statement to be filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,
``it is my intent to recommend that the United States terminate its
participation in the Beirut Agreement.''
   An attorney for the seven moviemakers in the case, David Cole of
the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, called Wick's
response unreasonable.
   ``It's like the kid with the football who says, `If I can't win
the game, I'm taking the ball home,'' Cole said in a telephone
interview Monday.
   Justice Department officials handling the case did not respond
to a telephone request for comment.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima sided with the
moviemakers in 1986, ruling that the USIA policies violated the
moviemakers' constitutional rights to free speech. He ordered the
agency to redraft its rules.
   Last May, Tashima rejected new rules, which included a provision
allowing the government to brand a movie propaganda.
   The USIA has appealed that ruling and has asked the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which upheld a challenge
to Tashima's original ruling, to reconsider.
   Wick wrote that the redrafted rules were a good-faith attempt to
implement the court order and that broadening the rules further
would amount to abandoning the treaty.
   In keeping with its interpretation of the treaty, the agency
demanded that movies that advocate a point of view acknowledge that
another point of view exists, Wick said.
   Cole said his organization, a public interest lawyers group, and
the American Civil Liberties Union have drafted a proposed set of
rules for movie certification, but USIA officials had refused to
consider it.

   Riot police today arrested about 1,400
striking locomotive engineers and their relatives whose protests
paralyzed the national railway system.
   Police said thousands of riot police were mobilized to disperse
sit-ins by engineers and their supporters at railway stations in
Seoul and other cities. The strikers were demanding higher pay and
shorter working hours.
   In Seoul, hundreds of police stormed a Korean National Railroad
building and arrested about 300 engineers.
   No clashes were reported.
   Police said they would release most of the detainees, but that
others would be charged with illegal activity under laws banning
wildcat strikes by government officials.
   The state-run Korea National Railroad, a government agency, said
the strike _ which began shortly after midnight _ disrupted about
90 percent of normal daily service of 2,050 trains and affected
more than 1 million passengers.
   The engineers, who earn an average of $1,230 a month, are
demanding a 100 percent increase in wages, including overtime.
About 4,400 train engineers and their assistants work for the
national railroad.
   The railroad management has offered the workers a reduction in
working hours from the current average of 245 hours to 224 hours a
month, in addition to monthly raises from about $100 to about $138.

   Veteran announcer Jack Clark, the
announcer for NBC's popular ``Wheel of Fortune'' game show, has
died following a long battle with bone cancer. He was 62.
   Clark died Thursday at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank,
said Laura Meyer, a spokeswoman for the show.
   Clark introduced Wheel hosts Pat Sajak and Vanna White. He also
announced the show's contestants, described prizes and named the
show's sponsors.
   Ms. Meyer said many fans had written letters asking about Clark
after he left the show several months ago.
   ``His voice was so well-known,'' she said.
   Clark began his career in broadcasting more than 40 years ago,
and received his first professional job as a substitute radio
announcer at KROW Radio in Oakland. After graduating, he worked as
a staff announcer for CBS radio.
   By 1952, Clark had moved to New York, where he became the
program announcer for the TV game shows ``Password,'' ``To Tell The
Truth,'' ``Split Second'' and ``The $25,000 Pyramid.''
   In the 1970s, Clark hosted TV game shows such as ``Dealer's
Choice'' and ``The Cross-Wits.''
   Clark was born in St. Joseph, Mo., and raised in California. He
is survived by his wife, Barbara, and four children.

<HEAD>Union Drops Opposition To Detroit JOA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last newspaper union to oppose a proposed
partial merger of Detroit's two major newspapers has dropped its
objections, and backers say the plan now meets all requirements for
federal approval.
   The Newspaper Guild of Detroit on Monday said it would not
oppose a joint operating agreement between the Detroit Free Press
and The Detroit News after receiving concessions from the Free
Press, according to Don Kummer, administrator of Newspaper Guild
Local 22.
   The U.S. Justice Department's Anti-Trust Division and an
adminstrative law judge, along with suburban Detroit newspapers,
remain opposed to the plan. Five other newspaper unions have
endorsed the proposal.
   Knight Ridder Inc., owner of the Free Press, and Gannett Co.
Inc., owner of the News, filed a statement with the Justice
Department saying the merger application meets the standards for
approval set by the Newspaper Preservation Act.
   The newspapers asked the Justice Department in 1986 for an
exemption in antitrust law allowing them to merge business,
advertising and circulation departments. Editorial departments
would remain separate.
   A spokesman for Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who must rule
on such exemptions, has said he will decide on it before he leaves
office, which a spokesman has said will be by Aug. 15.
   Meese said Monday in Washington that the Guild's new position
would not affect his ruling. He declined further comment.
   Knight-Ridder has said if Meese rejects the request, it would
close the Free Press, resulting in the loss of 2,200 jobs. Both
newspapers claim they have lost millions of dollars in recent years.
   The Guild's agreement with the Free Press reduces the number of
Guild members to be laid off at the Free Press under a joint
operating agreement from 100 to no more than 75. The agreement also
guarantees the jobs of 45 maintenance workers at the News.
   The Guild represents about 650 editorial and business employees
at the Free Press and about 300 editorial workers at the News.
   The Guild filed a statement with the Justice Department which
``urges that the (merger) be approved.'' The statement said the
union has become convinced ``that the closing of the Free Press is
inevitable if the JOA is not approved.''
   Knight Ridder issued a statement Monday welcoming the Guild's
decision. News President and Publisher Louis A. Weil III declined
to comment.
   The Free Press had 1987 circulation of 639,720 daily and 724,342
on Sundays, while circulation of the News was 678,720 daily and
839,319 on Sundays, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation.

   The grandson of an elderly woman who found
nitroglycerin tablets in her coffee has been arrested for
investigation of attempted murder, police said.
   Alfred Sevilla, 23, was arrested Monday after numerous
inconsistencies in his story to detectives surfaced, said police
Lt. Sergio Robleto.
   Before the arrest, however, a market in the woman's eastside
neighborhood, which had sold her the coffee, pulled it from the
shelves. The brand was removed after police contacted the store,
which was not identified, and said there was a possibility the
product had been contaminated.
   Sevilla's grandmother, Irma Rangel, 67, reported finding
crushed, broken and whole white pills in a coffee jar when she
started preparing a cup on Friday, Robleto said.
   Lab tests of the pills revealed they matched those from a
prescription vial of nitroglycerin in Ms. Rangel's home, Robleto
said.
   No one in the household suffered any ill effects, Robleto said.
   Nitroglycerin is often prescribed to heart patients to dilate
blood vessels that become constricted.

   The government expelled a Spanish

theology, the Roman Catholic radio station Caritas reported.
   Juan Antonio de la Vega, 65, was escorted by police Monday
across a bridge into the Argentine town of Clorinda, according to a
statement by the priest broadcast by Caritas.
   De la Vega was arrested 11 days ago and questioned about
liberation theology, a movement that advocates political change as
a way of achieving social reform. He later was released.
   At least 19 foreign priests have been expelled since 1969 by the
government of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   ``(De la Vega) has words of open opposition to our government.
He exhorted (people) to take arms to make a change,'' Carlos Ortiz
Ramirez, political secretary of Stroessner's Colorado Party, said
in a July 20 interview.
   ``Corrective measures are going to be taken in this case ... We
cannot permit a foreigner to get involved in our affairs.''

<TEXT>
   Mayor B.A. Johnson has ordered police to
``shoot to stop'' anyone caught fighting in the city's park.
   ``There has been too much fighting in the park _ young men from
Louisville, young men from Bartow, young men from Wadley _ and the
only way to break it up is for police to shoot them,'' Johnson said
Monday.
   The mayor said fighting in the 12-acre Hope Williams Memorial
Park has been a frequent problem, but Sunday's brawl involving
eight youths who used ``big sticks with nails driven in them'' as
weapons prompted him to take action against such skirmishes.
   He said no one was seriously injured in the fight, but it
presented a threat to the families and children who wanted to use
the park as well as a threat to the town's reputation.
   Johnson has ordered an increased police patrol in the park
during weekends. ``There will be a full-time policeman every
Friday, Saturday and Sunday,'' Johnson said. ``They are to shoot
from the waist down only.''
   ``We're going to fix it so decent people can go to the park. All
the hoodlums in Bartow, stay in Bartow,'' he said. ``All the
hoodlums in Louisville, stay in Louisville, and all the hoodlums in
Wadley have been suspended from the park for the rest of the year.''
   Johnson said he also has increased the fine for fighting in the
park from $71.50 to $125.
   Reports from the Police Department said seven of the eight
involved in Sunday's fight were juveniles and were turned over to
juvenile authorities. The adult was charged with fighting and
released on a $125 bond.
   Wadley, Louisville and Bartow are in a rural area of eastern
Georgia about 130 miles southeast of Atlanta.
   Johnson's ``shoot to stop'' order is the latest in a series of
such orders he has issued in the past three years.
   In 1986, Johnson issued a ``shoot to wound'' order _ instructing
police officers to shoot suspected burglars from the waist down _
after a rash of burglaries in the east Georgia town of 2,700.
   In 1985, Johnson ordered police to shoot stray dogs on sight to
control the animals, which city officials said roamed the streets
in packs, destroyed property, snapped at children and howled at the
moon. He even offered a bounty of $3 for every dog shot.
   No shooting ever took place and both orders were eventually
rescinded.
   Also in 1985, Johnson ordered police to arrest anyone using
profane language in public. The order was aimed at young people
playing basketball in the city park whose games were frequently
accompanied by loud streams of what then-City Administrator Lee
Garner described as ``pure, unadulterated profanity.''

White said. The strike was the first in the 50-year history of
Local 250 of the Hospital and Institutional Workers, which has
1,700 members.
   Karen Henry, a lawyer representing the hospitals, said Monday
that patients would not be affected by the walkout by licensed
vocational nurses, aides, housekeepers and laundry workers.
   The six hospitals in San Francisco and one in neighboring Daly
City hired additional workers and also will use management
employees, she said.
   Union officials disputed the hospitals' claim that patient care
would not suffer.
   ``The union takes the stand that that attitude is irresponsible.
You can't take away 1,700 workers from seven institutions and
expect it not to have any effect,'' said Joe Twarog, Local 250's
chief negotiator.
   As Affiliated Hospitals of San Francisco, the hospitals had
negotiated with Local 250 for a new, two-year contract since
February. A federal mediator adjourned talks Saturday because no
progress had been made.
   Health insurance was the major issue in the dispute. Affiliated
Hospitals offered full coverage at no cost to employees, but a new
provision would require contributions of $30 a month from full-time
employees for family benefits.
   Also at issue were wages, with Affiliated Hospitals offering 3
percent raises for vocational nurses and lower-tier employees and
no increase for higher-tier workers. Pay currently ranges from
$7.90 an hour for housekeeping, laundry and food service employees
and hospital aides to $11.70 an hour for technicians and vocational
nurses.
   Talks continued between six of the hospitals and about 2,000
registered nurses. The California Nurses Association has voted to
strike Aug. 2 if no agreement is reached.
   The hospitals are St. Mary's, St. Francis, Marshall Hale,
Children's, Pacific Presbyterian and Mt. Zion hospitals in San
Francisco and Seton Medical Center in Daly City.

   Burma's ruling party today chose its No. 4
ranked leader _ Sein Lwin _ as party chairman to replace Ne Win,
who wielded authoritarian power over this Southeast Asian nation
for a quarter century.
   A brief news release said the Central Committee of the Burma
Socialist Program Party elected the 64-year-old retired army
general during a special session.
   Sein Lwin, a hardliner widely criticized for his ruthless
handling of student demonstrations, has served as the party's joint
general secretary since 1985. He also holds the government post of
Council of State secretary.
   His elevation to the country's top post appeared to dash hopes
among the public here that Ne Win's retirement would lead to
widespread reform of Burma's one-party, military-backed system.
   Shortly after the announcement, state radio reported that Prime
Minister Maung Maung Kha and Attorney General Myint Maung had been
dismissed from their posts after being found reponsible for bloody
student riots here last March.
   It was Sein Lwin who was widely criticized in Burma for the
brutal suppression of those riots, in which 100 people are said to
have been killed.
   The radio annoucement gave no further details.
   Ne Win asked to step down Saturday after 26 years in power. On
Monday, a special party congress accepted his resignation and that
of the second most powerful figure in the country _ party Vice
Chairman San Yu, also the country's president.
   The 77-year-old Ne Win, who came to power in a 1962 military
coup, cited violent anti-government rioting in March and June, for
which he acknowledged some reponsibility, and his age as reasons
for stepping down.
   Today's news release said the vice chairmanship of the party was
left vacant and Aye Ko, who some had expected to succeed Ne Win,
retained the No. 3 job of general secretary. It was not clear why
Aye Ko was passed over for the top job.
   A three-day special party congress ended Monday with little but
vaguely-worded statements issued to the public, possibly reflecting
splits within the party over recent events.
   After the congress ended the 1,061 delegates were suddenly
summoned back _ some from areas outside Rangoon _ but the session
did not reconvene.
   Official Radio Rangoon announced Monday that delegates had
``firmly suggested'' rejecting a referendum called by Ne Win which
could have ended 26 years of one-party rule.
   It marked the first known instance in which the party did not
rubber-stamp Ne Win's proposals.
   State radio announced late Sunday that an emergency parliament
session would convene Wednesday, apparently to act on the
referendum proposal. Although the parliament is empowered to order
a referendum by majority vote, it is not expected to oppose the
party decision.
   The emergency session could also deal with the appointment of a
new president to replace San Yu. By tradition a party leader who
quits his party post also resigns his government job.
   The political changes in Burma follow months of street riots and
deepening public discontent over the country's deteriorating
economic situation.
   Public anger peaked last October when the government withdrew
several currency notes from circulation and failed to provide any
compensation, sparking the first major riots in Burma since 1974.
   Sein Lwin commanded the military forces that brutally put down a
student protest in Rangoon last March in which more than 100 people
are said to have died. Recently the government admitted that 41
protesters suffocated in a van after their arrests.
   He also commanded an army company which killed 22 students
during anti-government demonstrations at Rangoon University in July
1962.
   Efforts to liberalize the economy last year failed to stop
Burma's downward spiral. Inflation is soaring, government stores
are virtually empty and the country is saddled with a foreign debt
of about $4 billion.
   Sein Lwin was among several party members who offered their
resignations alonmg with Ne Win last week. But the party congress
rejected them, saying the leaders were still young enough to rule.
   Succeeding Sein Lwin as joint general secretary was Kyaw Htin, a
member of the Central Executive Committee as well as deputy prime
minister and defense minster.

<HEAD>Wage Increases During First Six Months Averaged 2.2 Percent a Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major collective bargaining settlements in
private industry during the first six months of this year provided
for wage increases averaging 2.2 percent a year, the government
said today.
   The Labor Department said that the last time these settlements
were negotiated, generally in 1985 or 1986, the wage increases over
the life of the contract averaged 2.9 percent.
   The contracts negotiated in the first six months of the year
involved 1.02 million workers.
   The report said that the average pay increase for the first year
of the contracts was 2.6 percent, compared to a first-year wage
boost of 2.3 percent the last time labor and management in these
industries negotiated.
   Meanwhile, in a second report, the department said that wage and
benefit increases rose 4.6 percent for the 12 months ending in
June. This compared to a 3.3 percent increase during the same
period a year ago.
   This increase included wages and benefits such as employee
contributions to health and pension plans.

   A woman who hijacked an airliner with 146
people aboard to Cuba 19 years ago has been arrested in Albany,
where she has lived for five years under assumed names, authorities
said.
   Linda Joyce Grinage, 39, was arrested Monday, said FBI agents,
who added they have 14 aliases listed for her. She was living under
the name of Haziine Eytina with her husband and five children.
   A hearing to certify Grinage's identity was postponed until
Wednesday. Grinage's husband, Milo Eytina, told acting U.S.
Magistrate Joseph Scully that a New York City lawyer had agreed to
represent his wife, but could not get to Albany today.
   Eytina, also a lawyer, said the identification of his wife as
the hijacker was ``absolute poppycock.''
   Grinage and her then-husband, Tyrone Ellington Austin, took a
2-year-old boy hostage on an Eastern Airlines flight from New
York's Kennedy International Airport to Miami on Jan. 2, 1969, then
forced the pilot at gunpoint to fly to Havana, authorities said.
   While running up the aisle, Austin shouted ``Black Power'' and
``Havana,'' according to authorities. None of the 138 passengers or
eight crew members was hurt.
   Grinage and Austin were indicted on air piracy charges later
that year, although they remained in Havana for a time after the
passengers and crew returned, according to the FBI. Austin died in
1971 from wounds he received during a shootout with New York City
police while fleeing a bank robbery.
   Authorities did not say how or when Grinage and Austin
re-entered the United States.
   Grinage had been living in the Albany area since 1983 but police
were not tipped about her whereabouts until receiving an anonymous
phone call in July 1987, said Barbara Cottrell, an assistant U.S.
attorney. Police did not make an arrest until Monday because they
needed time to confirm her identity, she said.
   Authorities did that through writing samples and telephone
records of a phone call made to the Rev. Walter Staten of New York
City, Grinage's grandfather, according to an affidavit made for a
search warrant.
   Grinage, who wore a red bandanna, jeans and a T-shirt in court,
walked by reporters without commenting.
   Eytina said he believed the arrest was a mistake.
   The charges are ``completely inconsistent with the person I
know,'' Eytina said. ``It's absolute poppycock. It makes excellent
fiction.''
   In court, Eytina said his wife ``has roots in the community, is
gainfully employed in the community and has resided in the
community for 10 years.''
   ``She is unable to respond in her present state,'' Eytina told
Scully, describing his wife as ``distraught.''
   If convicted, she could be imprisoned for 20 years to life.
   Cottrell said Grinage had at least six addresses in Albany since
1983. The prosecutor said she wasn't aware that the woman had a job.
   Cottrell said she would ask that Grinage be held without bail,
and would not comment on whether authorities would pursue charges
against Eytina.

   Firefighters today called in helicopters and said they would use
natural barriers to try to maneuver a forest fire that burned
within 10 miles of Old Faithful geyser in parched Yellowstone
National Park.
   Helicopters slinging torches that spit a napalm-like substance
were called in, and ground crews used meadows and streams as a wall
against the fire, said Incident Commander Larry Caplinger. A final
decision on sending out the helicopters was expected later today.
   ``What we can do, we can go out to one side or the other of the
head of a fire, and ignite fire and get it to building and have it
draw the head of the fire in one direction or another,'' he said
this morning.
   ``We would just be trying to further influence the fire. It's
going in the direction that we want it to go, but the more we can
get it going in a more northerly direction, the better,'' Bob
Smart, fire planning coordinator, said today.
   About 450 firefighters moved into the area Monday, and by
tonight the total was expected to swell to 800 to protect the Old
Faithful complex of hotels and cabins from the North Fork fire,
which covered more than 2,700 acres.
   While officials earlier had said the fire burned to within eight
miles of the geyser, Caplinger said it was still 10 to 12 miles to
the west today and burning toward the northeast.
   ``The fire will burn to the northeast and will miss the Old
Faithful area,'' Fire Information Officer Lee Poague predicted late
Monday. ``We're not in as much jeopardy as we thought we were.''
   Blazes in America's oldest national park have blackened about
52,400 acres of its 2.2 million acres, which is mostly in Wyoming's
northwest corner but extends into Idaho and Montana. In addition to
Wyoming, wildfires burned in sections of seven other Western states
and Alaska.
   Nearly 15 miles southeast of Old Faithful, hot embers Monday
night rained down on Grant Village, burning through power lines as
the 4,500-acre Shoshone fire and the 3,000-acre Red fire approached
the area.
   The fire did not damage a small hotel, National Park Service
staff apartments and several house trailers in the area because
they were made of cinder block and other non-flammable materials,
Poague said.
   The area was evacuated last weekend, along with the Lewis Lake
campground nearly 10 miles to the southwest and the park's southern
entrance was closed.
   At Lewis Lake, the fires burned to within one-eighth of a mile
of the campground, and crews hosed down structures to keep them
from catching fire, Poague said. About 500 firefighters battled
both blazes.
   The threat to the Old Faithful area had seemed more serious
because of aerial surveys and misleading winds, Poague said.
   Ground winds blew the blaze northeast into backcountry where it
could burn untended, away from the geyser that erupts every 30 to
100 minutes, Poague said. But another wind at a higher altitude
blew smoke west, toward Old Faithful, making it seem the blaze was
headed that way.
   No services or accommodations at Old Faithful have been closed,
but visitors have been advised such action may be necessary, said
park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   About 1,200 guests generally spend a night at the historic Old
Faithful Inn, the Snow Lodge and cabins in the area around Old
Faithful, said park Assistant Superintendent Ben Clary.
   Crews also fought the 31,500-acre Clover Mist fire in the park's
eastern half to keep it out of adjacent Shoshone National Forest,
Poague said.
   In the Teton Wilderness along Yellowstone's southern border,
more than 700 firefighters made progress today along the northern
side of the 24,400-acre Mink Creek fire, working to keep it from
spreading into Yellowstone Meadows and Shoshone, officials said.
   Precipitation at Yellowstone is 7.5 inches below normal for the
year, and the Old Faithful area got just 0.75 of an inch of rain in
June, the National Weather Service said.
   Other fires crackled across hundreds of acres of brush and
forest elsewhere in Wyoming and in parts of Idaho, Washington,
Oregon, Utah, Colorado and Montana. Temperatures Monday climbed to
more than 100 degrees in sections of Oregon and Washington.
   Firefighters in central and northern California mopped up dozens
of little fires while more lightning strikes were reported in the
Sierra Nevada range. Crews virtually extinguished a pair of fires
in Calaveras County that burned about 11,000 acres and eight homes,
officials said.
   In Alaska, where more than 50 fires have charred about 1.2
million acres, firefighters were battling only 22 of the blazes.
   Among the many fires in Alaska, one near Waring Mountain, east
of Kotzebue in northwest Alaska, had jumped in size by 10,000
acres, spreading to 207,000 acres, the Bureau of Land Management
reported Monday.
   BLM spokeswoman Sue Mitchell said the blaze destroyed an
unoccupied cabin and authorities were unsure if it was abandoned or
in use.
   Fire lines were holding in check a 323,000-acre fire near
Livengood in interior Alaska. It was just seven miles from the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline, but the line was in no danger, Mitchell
said.

   The Communist Party leadership in Armenia today
sharply criticized activists who led a six-month campaign to annex
an Armenian region in a neighboring republic.
   The party position, outlined in the newspaper Pravda, reflected
an unusually harsh line against those pressing for Armenian control
of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave in neighboring
Azerbaijan.
   Coming after a hardline speech by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in which he rejected ethnically motivated claims, it
seemed designed to show pro-annexation activists they could no
longer count on high-level support. Armenia's parliament voted in
June to annex Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Azerbaijani authorities opposed the change, and the Kremlin last
week deemed annexation ``impossible.''
   Pravda reported that party leaders in Armenia met Monday to
discuss ``the instigatoray character of speeches at meetings'' held
in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
   The Armenian leaders ``condemned the extremist, instigatory,
politically harmful speeches and urged ... all the ideological
agencies to launch effective efforts to expose the anti-people
character ... of the activists,'' Pravda reported.
   Armenians account for about three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's
162,000 residents, and they have complained of mistreatment by the
government of Azerbaijan, which is predominantly Moslem. Most
Armenians are Christians.
   Labor unrest that brought Nagorno-Karabakh to a virtual
standstill for two months began subsiding Monday, when Tass said 78
percent of the region's workers showed up at their jobs.
   Both the state-run media and activists in Stepanakert,
Nagorno-Karabakh's central city, reported Monday that the strikes
were over and business was proceeding at a normal pace.
   Some have vowed to continue the fight for annexation, but
central authorities have made it clear that a tougher stance will
be taken by police in future demonstrations or work stoppages.
   Activists in Yerevan called last week for a five-day strike to
protest the July 18 decision by the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, but most residents ignored the proposal.

   The government is dropping forfeiture
proceedings against the owners of a top ocean research vessel that
had been seized under the government's ``zero tolerance'' anti-drug
policy, an attorney said.
   The multimillion-dollar vessel is being released because the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution of Massachusetts didn't know
any drugs were aboard, according to its attorney, Raymond Zvetina.
   Zvetina said he was notified Monday that the U.S. Treasury
Department has decided to drop forfeiture proceedings. The vessel
had been seized May 18 after Customs officers found a trace of
marijuana and two drug-related pipes when the vessel returned from
a trip off the coast of South America.
   Atlantis II, a 210-foot vessel that participated in the 1986
exploration of the sunken liner Titanic, had been allowed to
continue its scheduled scientific voyages, but the institute was
required to inform Customs of its movement pending the outcome of
forfeiture proceedings.
   According to the Treasury Department, the forfeiture proceedings
will be formally terminated after Woods Hole pays the expenses of
the seizure.
   However, Zvetina said the institute may not have to pay any
expenses because its personnel operated the ship during the entire
seizure period.
   The Treasury Department, which has authority over Customs,
determined the institute was innocent because it had no knowledge
of the drugs and had taken reasonable precautions to prevent a
violation, Zvetina said.
   Richard F. Morris, the crew member in whose stateroom the
marijuana was found, pleaded guilty in May to a misdemeanor charge
of possession of a controlled substance. Morris, 27, of Buzzards
Bay, Mass., was sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and
fined $100.
   Capt. Joe Coburn, marine operations manager for the institute,
said Morris also was put on three months' suspension.

<HEAD>Normalization Of Relations Seen As `Very Difficult'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with Walters television
interview remarks on Iran; Picks up 3rd graf pvs, White House.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said
today it would be ``very difficult'' to restore normal relations
with Iran before the release of hostages held in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian extremists.
   Vernon Walters said he thought it was unlikely there would be
any re-establishment of relations with Tehran, at least in the next
couple of months, because of the hostage situation.
   Walters made the remarks amid statements from the Reagan
administration that it is prepared to discuss the hostage problem
with Iran, but only with authoritative figures and with no
deal-making.
   President Reagan, asked Monday whether the time had come to talk
to Iranian officials about the hostages, replied, ``If they're
willing and ready to talk, it's time.''
   The administration has expressed interest in establishing a
dialogue with ``authoritative'' Iranian leaders, but no official
has yet publicly suggested that a rapprochement could take place in
the absence of a hostage release.
   In an interview on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'', Walters was asked
if it was possible to normalize relations with Iran before the nine
American hostages are released.
   ``Well, it would be very difficult,'' he replied. ``There's no
question that the people that are holding the hostages have some
kind of allegiance or connection with Iran. I think it would be
very difficult for us to justify anything unless they released the
hostages.''
   Walters said Iranian officials would have to explain why the
hostages remain in captivity.
   ``I mean, what are they holding these people for, that have
nothing to do with the policies they don't like?'' the ambassador
said. ``These people are college professors and doctors and
librarians, and what have they got to do with the U.S. government
policies that the Iranians don't like? It's a totally illogical and
rather cowardly thing to hold those hostages.''
   ``I think the whole fact that they seized our embassy and held
150 people there hostage for a year, they've probably destroyed the
embassy or seriously damaged it,'' Walters said. He said there
would have to be arrangements about ``where we'd go'' and a whole
lot of other complicated logistical arrangements
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials hope
that Iran's acceptance of a U.N. ceasefire resolution ``will lead
to an improving relationship and circumstances where we might be
able to have a dialogue.''
   ``But that does not diminish the fact that we will only have a
dialogue with authoritative representatives of the government,''
the spokesman said, ``and that has not occurred.''
   The White House often has said that it was doing all it could to
win the release of nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian elements, and recent developments have prompted new
speculation about a possible hostage release.
   Reagan made only a terse statement in response to a reporter's
question Monday as the president concluded a Rose Garden ceremony
honoring youths selected for the American Legion's Boys Nation
political studies program.
   The president has steadfastly defended his administration's
clandestine sale of U.S. anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to
the revolutionary government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in
1985-86.
   Reagan has offered conflicting accounts of whether the sales
amounted to an arms-for-hostages deal.
   Two hostages, the Rev. Benjamin Weir and David Jacobsen, were
released during the time of the transfers of U.S. arms to Iran.
Money from the arms sales eventually was diverted to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels, leading to the Reagan administration's worst scandal.
   Reagan did not elaborate on his terse statement of Monday.
   But Fitzwater told reporters that ``our position remains the
same, that we're always available to talk any time, any place about
the safety or the release of the hostages but we will not negotiate
for them and we don't anticipate any negotiations.''
   An administration official noted earlier Monday that the United
States had sent a new message to Iran last week asking about the
possibility of talks aimed at normalizing relations. Tehran still
has not sent an ``authorized'' reply, the official said.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said the United
States would like to talk to the Iranians about ending the Persian
Gulf war, the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon, and
terrorism. But he said the U.S. message did not specify conditions
for a resumption of relations, which were severed in 1980.

<HEAD>Doctors Issue Special Appeal To American Indians For Marrow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors are asking American Indians to
consider donating bone marrow for a transplant to save the life of
a 4-year-old Indian girl suffering from a rare form of leukemia.
   The appeal to potential Indian donors for Rae Lynn Geshick was
made because heredity factors make this the best approach, doctors
said Monday.
   Without the transplant, the girl will probably die within six
months, said Dr. Philip McGlave, director of the Adult Bone Marrow
Transplant Program at the University of Minnesota.
   If she gets the transplant, her chances of surviving are 1 in 3,
McGlave said during a news briefing at the American Indian Center.
   Rae Lynn's four siblings and her biological parents do not have
compatible bone marrow, and a search of the National Bone Marrow
Donor Registry found no match among the 18,000 registered donors,
said Dr. David Stroncek, medical director of the registry. Most of
those registered are Caucasian.
   Rae Lynn, who lives with her foster parents, was diagnosed as
having a rare form of blood cancer _ chronic myelogenous leukemia _
when she was 8 months old. She received intensive chemotherapy and
her disease went into remission for about three years, but she
became ill again last April.
   ``All of my people, please get out and help this little girl,''
said her foster mother, Lillian Bruehl, who is a Chippewa Indian.
   If 1,000 American Indian volunteers can be tested, two or three
may be found with bone marrow that matches Rae Lynn's, Stroncek
said.

   The former head of the Justice Department's
criminal division said today he had told Edwin Meese III in
resigning that he thought the attorney general had probably
committed felonies in doing favors for his long-time friend, E.
Robert Wallach.
   ``I advised Mr. Meese on the day I resigned,'' said former
Asssistant Attorney General William Weld, that Wallach had
``certainly'' violated the federal law barring the giving of
gratuities to publich officials in exchange for official acts and
that Meese ``probably had violated the statute as well.''
   Weld said that as a lesser Justice Department official he had
won convictions of Massachusetts building inspectors and a
congressman with less evidence on the same charge.
   Weld listed for the Senate Judiciary Committee 63 items of fact
concerning the attorney general's relationship with Wallach which
Weld said bolstered his contention that Meese had violated ethics
regulations and probably had violated the gratuities statute.
   Weld questioned Meese's actions in assisting the scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp., an Iraqi oil pipeline project and regional Bell
telephone companies.
   Another top aide, who resigned with Weld, told the committee he
had quit because the department's morale and performance were
deteriorating due to Meese's legal problems.
   That aide, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arnold
Burns, testified that, ``from my vantage point, I could see that
performance by the Department of Justice was being impeded by a
deep malaise that was setting in by virtue of Mr. Meese's problems
and the public outcry for his resignation.''
   Weld told the committee that Meese had certainly violated
federal ethics guidelines prohibiting public officials from
committing acts which give any appearance of impropriety.
   ``Because I had concluded that Mr. Meese's conduct over the
years had given the appearance of partiality to Mr. Wallach, and
constituted the use of Mr. Meese's public office for Mr. Wallach's
private gain, I would have resigned from the Justice Department
when I did irrespective of whether I had felt Mr. Meese's conduct
also infringed the provisions of the gratuity statute.
   ``A possible defense against a gratuity charge being applied to
Mr. Meese is that all of the things of value he received from Mr.
Wallach were done in the name of friendship, and had no relation to
any of the official acts performed by Mr. Meese which benefited Mr.
Wallach,'' Weld said.
   ``My conclusion was that there were simply too many official
acts performed by Mr. Meese to benefit Mr. Wallach, and too many
things of value conferred by Mr. Wallach on Mr. Meese, for a
prosecutor to conclude as a matter of fact or law that the gratuity
provisions ... would not apply.''
   ``Not only did Mr. Meese perform many official acts for the
benefit of Mr. Wallach, but his efforts in that regard were
unusual, in the case of'' Wedtech, the oil pipeline and Meese's
decision, following a receipt of a memo from Wallach, on behalf of
the regional Bell telephone companies.
   ``In return, Mr. Wallach appears to have become, over time, the
financial `Johnny-on-the-spot' for Mr. Meese,'' said Weld.
   According to Weld as well as an 814-page report by independent
counsel James McKay, some of the items of value which were provided
to Meese by Wallach included legal services for which Wallach did
not charge Meese, arranging to provide Meese with the services of
financial manager W. Franklyn Chinn and helping arrange a
$40,000-a-year job for Meese's wife, Ursula.
   Weld said that he had outlined his views of Meese's culpability
to President Reagan and Vice President Bush, as well as
congressional leaders and other White House aides.
   ``It is well-documented that Mr. Wallach enjoyed unparalleled
access to Mr. Meese and saw him frequently throughout the time Mr.
Meese was in the White House and at the Justice Department,'' Weld
said. ``I concluded that if Mr. Meese were an ordinary public
official he would be prosecuted under the gratuity law. When I was
the U.S. attorney in Boston, we successfully prosecuted building
inspectors who accepted gifts from friends who maintained they
merely wanted to `get in good' or `say thanks' or `expedite' an
otherwise lawful official action.
   ``And when I was head of the Justice Department's criminal
division in Washington, I reviewed and approved the indictment of a
sitting U.S. congressman who took an action to benefit a company in
his district and received two free trips to Florida from a business
and social acquaintance who had an interest in the company. The
congressman was indicted and convicted of a violation of the
gratuity provisions.
   The federal gratuity law is a felony punishable by up to two
years in prision. McKay came to the conclusion that Meese had not
violated the gratuity statute based largely on the conclusion that
the things of value that passed between Wallach and Meese were done
in the name of friendship.
   Testifying before Weld, Burns said that Meese ``was recused in a
number of matters and recusals multiplied by virtue of his being
defended by a law firm which had many matters in the Department of
Justice. This, coupled with the devotion of enormous amounts of
department time and resources to Mr. Meese's defense, adversely
affected morale and performance.''
   In addition, Burns testified, there have been a number of cases
where other department employees, ranging from senior officials to
line personnel, were placed with Meese's approval on administrative
leave while serious allegations of misconduct against them were
under investigation.
   ``I was confronted with the argument that it was wrong for us to
place an employee on administrative leave where allegations were
not as serious as those facing Attorney General Meese and that the
same standard should apply, that the attorney general should be
measured by the same standard as any other department employee and,
if there were a difference in the standard, the one applying to the
attorney general should be more stringent,'' Burns said.
   ``I had no answer to this argument,'' he said.
   Burns said that he held discussions with Weld and others in the
department, had discussions with White House counsel A.B.
Culvahouse and White House chief of staff Howard Baker, and that
``I decided that I had to leave.''
   ``It became clear as a bell to me that I could no longer bear
silent witness to the deterioration of morale, the paralysis and
performance setting in in the department and the continuing erosion
of public confidence in the department,'' he said.
   Burns said he was prohibited by the 1978 Ethics in Government
Act from discussing his concerns directly with Meese during the
criminal investigation of the attorney general.
   ``There was only one way I could make a statement that something
was wrong,'' Burns said. ``I chose it. I resigned.''
   Meese on Monday attacked Burns and Weld, saying they failed to
conduct a ``competent and thorough'' departmental inquiry of Meese
in the spring of 1987, resulting in the criminal probe by
independent counsel James McKay.
   McKay recently concluded that Meese ``probably'' broke criminal
laws on four occasions, but the independent counsel did not seek an
indictment.
   Meese has announced he will resign, probably by mid-August,
claiming he is ``completely vindicated.''
   In a speech at the National Press Club, Meese declared that
``the evidence now shows that if a competent and thorough
preliminary investigation had been directed by the then-deputy
attorney general and the former head of the criminal division,
there would likely have been no cause for referral to an
independent counsel.'' The attorney general did not refer to Burns
and Weld by name.
   Meese said the decision to launch a criminal investigation of
him was based on ``hearsay'' from executives of the scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. who had pleaded guilty to felony charges.

   Republican George Bush today proposed
rewriting conflict-of-interest rules that govern federal employees
to cover a wider variety of misconduct and said members of Congress
no longer should be exempt from the provisions.
   ``Those who take on the people's trust must hold themselves to
an exacting code of conduct. We can expect, and indeed, tolerate
nothing less from the people who work for the government,'' the
vice president said.
   Bush, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, discussed the
subject of ethics and standards of conduct in a speech to a
gathering of congressional interns at the Library of Congress. It
comes on the heels of Democrats' charges of ``sleaze'' in the
Reagan administration.
   Bush said that in his many years of government he has been
``guided by a moral compass of decency, integrity, fairness and
public purpose.''
   He said his philosophy is ``it's a privilege to serve, it's an
honor to hold the public trust and it's a disgrace to violate it.''
   Bush said that as president he would establish an office of
senior counselor to the president whose first responsibility would
be ethics. He said the counselor would be in charge of a White
House ethics office that would complement the work of the existing
Office of Government Ethics.
   Bush complained that the present system of federal ethics law
``is a confused quiltwork of executive policy statements,
administrative regulations, criminal laws. Indeed, virtually every
agency of government issues its own set of standards of conduct.''
   He said that under his administration the code of conduct would
be clear, uniform and reflect common sense. ``Nothing will be
overly technical. What is intuitively right _ what your conscience
tells you _ will invariably be the written rule,'' he said.
   He said the standards he would prescribe would eliminate
``needless restrictions'' to avoid discouraging good people from
serving in government.
   ``The sanctions imposed by law for breach of the standards of
conduct must be fair and proportionate,'' the vice president said.
``Today there is little or no room under the conflicts law for the
exercise of discretion and the fashioning of a measured response.
   ``To put it in high relief, one is either charged with a felony
or nothing at all,'' Bush said. ``This is plainly unacceptable.''
   He said prosecutors should be free to exercise their judgment to
pursue civil remedies as well as enhance criminal sanctions.
   ``A wider variety of misconduct will consequently be reached,
with fair and proportionate responses for all,'' he said.
   He said the conflict-of-interest statutes must cover members of
Congress. ``To exempt Congress from any of these rules, as does
current conflict-of-interest law, is to establish a double standard
that breeds suspicion, breeds cynicism and in my judgment breeds
abuse,'' he said.
   In a break with the current administration, Bush said, ``I
whole-heartedly endorse the concept of an independent counsel,''
but again said that the independent counsel law should apply to
members of Congress as well.
   More than 100 administration officials have been accused of
wrongdoing during Reagan's term, including some of his closest
advisers, such as Michael Deaver, convicted of three counts of
perjury, and Lyn Nofziger, convicted of three charges that he
illegally lobbied the executive branch for private clients.
   Bush's speech has been long in the making, but was delayed until
the release of a report on the investigation of Attorney General
Edwin Meese III by independent counsel James M. McKay, who found
that Meese probably broke two tax laws and twice violated a
criminal conflict-of-interest statute. However, McKay decided not
to prosecute Meese, who is resigning.
   Bush, talking with reporters on Air Force II over the weekend,
said the Democrats are ``going to try to run against Meese. He
won't be around.''
   The vice president said the Justice Department, in particular,
must be above ``even the perception of wrongdoing.''
   ``I would have to reluctantly conclude _ reluctantly because I
like Meese _ that those standards were not met,'' Bush said.
   But he said he disagreed with the description of Meese as a
``sleaze'' by Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Little in the Wedtech
bribery and corruption case in New York.
   In accepting the Democratic presidential nomination to run
against Bush, Michael Dukakis said the government should set high
ethical standards for itself.
   ``We're going to have a Justice Department that isn't the
laughingstock of the nation,'' he said. ``We're going to have a
Justice Department that understands what the word `justice' means.
...
   ``And in the Dukakis White House ... if you accept the privilege
of public service, you had better understand the responsibilities
of public service. If you violate that trust, you'll be fired. If
you violate the law, you'll be prosecuted. And if you sell arms to
the ayatollah, don't expect a pardon from the president of the
United States.''

<HEAD>Sex Charges Against Teacher Prompt Changes At School For Deaf and
Blind</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only state-supported school in
Florida for the deaf and blind has tightened its hiring procedures
as a result of sex charges brought by male students against a
former dormitory teacher.
   The Florida School for the Deaf and Blind, whose alumni include
musician Ray Charles, now requires six, instead of three,
references from prospective employees and includes more questions
on job applications about contact with children.
   In addition, non-teaching staffers must undergo fingerprint and
criminal background checks. All new Florida teachers, including
those at the St. Augustine school, must already undergo such checks
to be certified.
   Dormitory teacher Charles Johnston, 22, was fired in April when
he was charged with sexually molesting 17 of the boys he was
entrusted to protect.
   Johnston, hired in 1985, pleaded innocent and is being held
without bail in the St. Johns County Jail pending a September trial.
   His accusers include 19 deaf boys aged 9 to 14 who are students
at the school founded in 1885. Most of the 550 students at the
school are deaf and live on campus.
   ``There has been an enormous shock because the individual
alleged to have done this is a person (who) had earned the trust of
many kids, parents,'' Principal Kenneth D. Randall said in an
interview published in Monday's editions of The Tampa Tribune.
   As a dormitory teacher, Johnston looked after the boys and
taught them how to dress, clean and study. He also supervised them
in games.
   Johnston is the fifth school employee since 1986 to be arrested
and fired on charges involving students at the school.
   In separate, unrelated cases, a classroom teacher and three
dormitory staffers pleaded no contest to charges including child
abuse, attempted lewd and lascivious assault, or solicitation of
sexual activity by someone in a custodial position.
   School administrators have hired a psychologist as a consultant
and are offering counseling to the students and their families.

   President Reagan struck back at the Democrats today, saying
their criticism of his administration has gotten ``my Irish up.''
George Bush, faced with Democratic charges of administration
``sleaze,'' criticized laws that he said mean officials are
``charged with a felony or nothing at all.''
   Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, was facing
heat at home over budget-line veto decisions in his role as
Massachusetts governor.
   Bush, the expected Republican nominee to succeed Reagan, said
recently he expects the Democrats are ``going to try to run against
Meese,'' a reference to Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who faced
a conflict-of-interest investigation but was not charged. But Bushf-interest
rules that govern federal employees to cover a
wider variety of misconduct and said members of Congress no longer
should be exempt.
   In his administration, Bush said, the code of conduct would be
clear and would reflect common sense. ``Nothing will be overly
technical. What is intuitively right _ what your conscience tells
you _ will invariably be the written rule,'' he said.
   ``Today there is little or no room under the conflicts law for
the exercise of discretion and the fashioning of a measured
response,'' he added. ``To put it in high relief, one is either
charged with a felony or nothing at all. This is plainly
unacceptable.''
   Reagan, at the outset of a White House meeting with Republican
congressional leaders today, lambasted the Democratic Party.
   ``To hear the opposition talk, you would think growth in our
economy had come to a dead halt,'' said Reagan, adding that
criticism emanating from the Democratic Convention in Atlanta got
``my Irish up.''
   ``The opposition talks about growth. We deliver,'' he said.
``The opposition talks about jobs, we deliver.''
   Reagan, reading his statement to reporters, said, ``George Bush
will cut taxes again. What will their nominee do? I mean, what will
he really do?''
   The president said he will be an active participant in the fall
campaign. He gave his own version of a campaign line associated
with the late President Harry S. Truman: ``I'm going to give the
opposition the truth, and they'll think it's hell.''
   Reagan was consulting with Republican congressional leaders on
his threat to veto legislation requiring companies to give workers
60 days' notice of plant closings and layoffs. The Democrats have
made the plant-closing measure a campaign issue.
   Dukakis, carrying out his duties as Massachusetts governor while
campaigning as the Democratic nominee for president, was spending
most of today at his Statehouse office.
   He faces legislative unrest over some of the $138 million in
spending he vetoed from the state's fiscal 1989 budget. But he was
upbeat Monday afternoon after a meeting between the
administration's top budget officer and House Speaker George
Keverian, declaring ``all is well.''
   Dukakis planned to break for a law-and-order appearance in
Boston, visiting a new police post at a downtown subway stop to
swear in six new members of the state transit police.
   He met for an hour Monday with Hungarian Prime Minister Karoly
Grosz before the communist leader headed to Washington to meet
President Reagan.
   Dukakis' running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, returned to his duties as
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee today as the panel began
writing a bill to correct errors and make changes in the 1986 tax
overhaul.
   Discussing today's White House meeting on plant closings,
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan probably would
veto the bill but no final decision had been made.
   The administration's stand on the issue has been repeatedly
assailed by Democrats, who say employers owe it to workers to tell
them when they are about to lose their jobs. Reagan says business
should have the ``flexibility'' to close plants and lay off workers
without the 60 days' notice.
   Bush, certain to win his party's nomination at the Republican
Convention next month, has stated sentiments similar to Reagan's on
the issue. There have been reports, however, that the Bush campaign
would prefer to see the president let the bill become law to ease
the political heat on Bush.
   Bentsen's dual campaigns for vice president and the Senate have
caused a temporary setback for the Dukakis campaign. Some $46
million in public money for the campaign is being held up because
of a complaint from the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
The Federal Election Commission planned to begin reviewing the
issue today.
   The Republican complaint says any money Bentsen spends on his
Senate re-election bid in Texas will directly benefit the
Democrats' presidential ticket and give it an unfair advantage. An
unusual Texas law permits Bentsen to seek both offices
simultaneously.

   Peace activist Philip Berrigan was sentenced
today to six months in jail in connection with an Easter
demonstration aboard a warship in which the ship's missile
launchers were ``symbolically disarmed.''
   U.S. Magistrate Tommy Miller ordered about 40 of Berrigan's
supporters to leave the courtroom when the group began reading a
statement.
   One man was dragged from the courtroom, but there were no
arrests. The demonstration continued in a hallway.
   Berrigan, 64, a former priest and longtime activist who resisted
the draft during the Vietnam War and now operates a Christian peace
mission in Baltimore, faced a maximum six months in prison on his
conviction of misdemeanor trespassing.
   Berrigan, along with Gregory Boertje, 32, Andrew Lawrence, 27,
and Sister Margaret McKenna, 57, were convicted by Miller in May of
misdemeanor trespassing in connection with the demonstration aboard
the battleship Iowa.
   The four ``symbolically disarmed'' the ship's cruise missile
launchers by beating on them with hammers and smearing them with
blood.
   They boarded the warship as part of an open house at the Norfolk
Naval Base, slipped away from their escorts and attacked the
armored launchers, doing minor damage.
   The four are members of the anti-nuclear group Plowshares
founded by Berrigan. The group claims the missiles are outlawed by
international law, and that their actions to symbolically disarm
the weapons were not illegal because they had no criminal intent.
   Sister McKenna received a two-year suspended sentence and was
placed on probation on the condition she not enter a military
establishment.
   Lawrence received a 4-month sentence and Boertje a 6-month term.
Both also were ordered to appear in federal court in Pennsylvania,
Lawrence for a probation violation hearing and Boertje for a
fugitive warrant.
   Boertje is wanted for failing to appear at a 1987 sentencing for
a similar demonstration. In that incident, protesters entered the
Willow Grove Naval Base outside Philadelphia and took hammers to
several aircraft, doing more than $165,000 in damage. Boertje faces
a possible 11{-year sentence in that case.

   Thunderstorms rumbled over much of the nation today, bringing
rain to drought-parched land, after severe storms belted the
Midwest and South with tornadoes, lightning, hail and fierce winds
that killed two people.
   A cold front hammered violent storms through the central United
States on Monday, producing severe weather in Michigan, Missouri
and Illinois.
   In Arkansas, a late evening thunderstorm whipped up high winds
that caused widespread damage around Pine Bluff. One person was
killed when a tree was blown onto an occupied car.
   In Michigan, lightning struck and killed a Jackson County woman
as thunderstorms packing winds up to 60 mph raced across the
state's southeastern Lower Peninsula, knocking out power to
thousands.
   Two tornadoes ripped through southeastern Michigan Monday
afternoon and a third touched down a few hours later, uprooting
trees and damaging crops near the eastern town of Lapeer.
   Elsewhere in Michigan, thunderstorms unleashed winds that downed
large trees near Alma, Saginaw County and Lapeer County and hail up
to an inch in diameter.
   The storm knocked out power to 20,288 Consumers Power Co.
customers in the southern Lower Peninsula; power was restored this
morning to all but 5,480 customers, company spokesman Kelly Farr.
About 1,200 Detroit Edison Co. customers scattered across southeast
Michigan also lost power, but only about 150 were without power
this morning, the utility said.
   In Missouri, thunderstorms generated high winds that downed
trees near Buffalo, Nevada, Cape Girardeau and Blodgett.
   Thunderstorms developing along the same cold front produced
severe weather at a few places in Illinois, Kansas and Oklahoma.
   In Illinois, farmers hoping for a little rain instead saw crops
battered by damaging hail as storms moved across the state,
stripping leaves off plants and causing spotty power outages from
Chicago to southern Illinois.
   More than 2 inches of rain fell at Cooksville in McLean County,
while more than 1.5 inches fell in Chicago and Springfield.
   Foul weather across central and south Florida damaged homes,
uprooted trees, downed power lines and left potholes up to 2 feet
long in a runway at Miami International Airport apparently caused
by lightning strikes.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over portions of the southern Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley,
the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and inland areas of the northern and
middle Atlantic Coast, lso over the south Atlantic coastal states
and eastern portions of the Gulf Coast states; and widely scattered
thunderstorms near Lake Superior and across the mountain areas of
the Western states.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s along the Pacific
Coast and the shores of the upper Great Lakes and in northern
Maine, between 95 and 105 degrees through the southern Plains,
western portions of the northern Plains and lower elevations west
of the Rockies; between 105 and 115 in the desert Southwest; and
between the 80s and low 90s throughout the rest of the United
States.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 94 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is
expected to make an unprecedented visit to a Soviet air base near
Moscow and naval facilities on the Black Sea during a visit to the
Soviet Union beginning next week, a senior Pentagon official said
today.
   Carlucci is scheduled to leave Washington on Thursday, rest in
Helsinki, Finland, arrive in Moscow on Monday, and travel to
Sevastapol in the Soviet Crimea before heading for Turkey next
Thursday, said the official.
   While in Moscow, Carlucci is expected to visit the General Staff
Military Academy in Moscow, the Kubinka Air Base about 30 miles
west of the Soviet capital, and a base housing the Truman division,
an element of Soviet ground forces. He is expected to fly to
Sevastopol on Wednesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition that he not be further
identified, expressed chagrin that the Soviets have not notified
Carlucci of his exact itinerary.
   He said Carlucci would not accept Soviet offers to negotiate
arms control agreements through the defense department.
   ``The Soviet Union frequently tries to engage various parties in
government and out of government as surrogate negotiators in the
arms control area ... We are there in the capacity of the Defense
Department. We are not there to negotiate arms control agreements
... or to play these kind of games,'' said the official.
   Carlucci's visit to Moscow is the latest in a series of military
talks that began during the Washington summit last December.
Carlucci met with his Soviet counterpart, Gen. Dmitri Yazov, in
Switzlerland last March and in Moscow in June.
   At the beginning of July, Soviet military Chief of Staff Marshal
Sergei Akhromeyev took a tour of U.S. facilities that included a
cruise aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt to watch
flight operations and a look inside a B-1 bomber and Minuteman
missile training facility.
   In return, U.S. officials let it be known that they wanted to
see the Soviet Blackjack bomber and visit Soviet ships at sea. But
so far, they have not received confirmation.
   ``Our formal agenda has not been agreed to yet,'' said the
official. ``... we let Marshal Akhromeyev know in detail what was
going to happen.''

<HEAD>Lugar Presses Bentsen to Keep Supporting Contras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top Republican on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee made a public appeal today for Lloyd Bentsen,
the new Democratic vice presidential nominee, to continue to vote
for aid to the Nicaraguan Contras despite the opposition of Michael
Dukakis.
   ``We believe we ought to have that vote,'' Sen. Richard Lugar of
Indiana told reporters. ``He voted consistently in support in the
past.''
   ``My guess is there will be a lot of criticism of Sen. Bentsen
if he abstains or doesn't vote on the Contra aid package,'' he
said. ``He has stood for that and been part of the bipartisan
coalition and to suddenly opt out now would be very strange.''
   Bentsen has supported President Reagan's requests for aid to the
Contra rebels in the past. A forthcoming vote that is expected in
the Senate would be his first opportunity to cast a vote on the
issue since becoming the running-mate of Democratic presidential
nominee Dukakis, who opposes Contra aid.
   Lugar commented after a meeting of GOP congressional leaders
with the president at the White House.
   He said the Contra issue was discussed and ``there was a general
consensus that the legislation ought to proceed.''
   He said there was no discussion of figures.
   ``We believe there ought to be military assistance,'' Lugar
said. ``We believe those funds will bring about some credibility in
negotiations.''
   ``Without there being humanitarian assistance, at least with
some military on the way if it doesn't work out, the thing really
won't accomplish what we want,'' he said.

<HEAD>Error-Correcting Bill Wins Committee OK</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee today approved a
bill of several hundred pages designed to correct errors in the
1986 tax overhaul.
   Attached to the bill, which won unanimous approval, was a
provision exempting farmers from paying the federal tax on diesel
fuel they buy for off-road use. A 1987 change requires them to pay
the tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and then apply for a refund at
yearend.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, said the
``technical corrections'' bill is too important to clutter with
other amendments that might delay its enactment. But he said
committee staff will attempt to put together a package of unrelated
tax amendments that would be added to the bill when it reaches the
Senate floor, if a majority of committee members can agree.
   That presumably would include, for example, an amendment
allowing free-lance writers and artists to deduct certain expenses
even before a book or painting begins producing revenue. Another
likely amendment would free owners of mutual fund shares from
paying a tax on certain operating expenses of the fund.
   Those provisions and numerous others were added to the
technical-corections bill by the House Ways and Means Committee, as
were selected tax increases targeted to pay for the tax benefits.
The House bill, for example, would impose a tax of $2.67 a pound on
pipe tobacco and bar moonlighters and others who work out of their
homes from deducting any part of their base monthly telephone bill.

   West Germans increasingly are snubbing
their traditional wurst and potatoes for vegetables.
   Vegetable consumption climbed from 152 pounds per person in 1982
to 170 pounds last year and is expected to continue to increase,
according to the Central Marketing Association for German
Agriculture.
   West German officials are among those lining up for plates of
leafy greens and vegetables. There's a new daily salad buffet
available at the commissary for employees at the office of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Vegetable dishes have also become a favorite at the cafeteria
for federal lawmakers, even though the traditional breaded cutlet,
sausages and ham sandwiches still are popular.
   The environmentalist Greens Party led the charge in altering the
menu at federal government cafeterias to include vegetarian dishes.
   Chefs at Kohl's personal kitchen say the chancellor sometimes
orders food from the commissary available to his employees, but
they refuse to say whether the portly politician is among those who
make a beeline for the salad buffet.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican's daily newspaper on Tuesday
criticized advertisements on Italian television that recommend
using condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS.
   The article in L'Osservatore Romano reaffirmed the Vatican's
opposition to promoting the use of condoms in the fight against
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, declaring that, as with
smoking, the best medical advice is abstinence.
   The Vatican commentary said the theory of not striking at the
roots of evil but only its consequences has resulted in the
promotion of condoms as the ``routine remedy'' of dealing with what
is presented as ``the evil of the century.''
   In a major statement in March, the Vatican newspaper said the
issue of sexual permissiveness was the ``true cause'' of the AIDS
problem.
   The latest commentary said the TV spots fit into the logic that
``the essential issue is not to prevent the evil but to control its
effects.''
   The spots, contracted by the Ministry of Health, begin Tuesday
on RAI-TV's three channels and run through Aug. 8, and then again
in mid-September.

<HEAD>Israeli Delegation To Moscow, First Visit in 21 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MASHA HAMILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of Israeli diplomats, including a former
Soviet dissident, left Tuesday for Moscow in a visit seen here as
critically important to Soviet-Israeli relations, which were
severed 21 years ago.
   The five delegates plan to join in Sabbath prayers at the main
synagogue on Friday evening in Moscow and to make themselves highly
visible among Soviet Jews, many of whom have been choosing to
emigrate to the United States and Europe instead of Israel.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who met Tuesday with visiting
Russian Orthodox Metropolitan Filaret, said he hoped for a
substantial improvement in Soviet-Israeli relations.
   The visit will be especially emotional for two of the Israelis.
Delegation head Meron Gordon emigrated from the Soviet Union at the
age of 10, and Yaakov Kedmi, 43, is a former Soviet Jewish
dissident who came here at the age of 24.
   ``We are both very moved,'' Gordon, 41, said on Israel
Television. ``When we left there, we were young. I don't think
either of us ever thought we could return to the Soviet Union _
certainly not as official representatives of Israel.''
   Yeshayahu Anug, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry, spent
the last year heading efforts aimed at gaining Soviet permission
for the official Israeli visit.
   He called it a ``major event'' and added ``the atmosphere is
promising ... but we don't intend to conquer the Soviet Union in
one day.''
   He said the immediate purpose of the delegation was to help
process Israeli visas both for Soviets wishing to emigrate and
those wishing to visit.
   From January to June, 6,017 Soviet Jews emigrated and 840 of
those went to Israel, according to the Geneva-based
Intergovermental Committee For Migration.
   In addition, the team will inspect the empty Israeli Embassy
building, for which Israel pays about $100,000 annual rent.
   Anug said the delegation's limited mandate could be expanded,
although there was no plan for it to take part in political talks
with Soviet officials.
   The diplomats traveled Tuesday to The Hague, where they are to
pick up two-month Soviet visas and then leave Thursday for Moscow.
Israel hopes the delegates will be allowed to stay longer.
   The Soviet Union severed ties with Israel after the 1967 Middle
East War to protest Israel's occupation of territory captured from
three Arab countries.
   Israel and the Soviet Union still have no official diplomatic
relations, but links between Moscow and Jerusalem have recently
improved.
   In the summer of 1986, Israeli and Soviet delegates met in
Helsinki, Finland, for the first official session since 1967. Last
summer, a Soviet delegation arrived in Tel Aviv on two-month visas
that since have been extended.

   George Bush Jr. says his father was
``right where he was supposed to be as vice president'' in response
to the rhetorical attack from Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy and
other Democrats of ``Where was George?''
   Kennedy, in a speech at last week's Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, wondered why the likely Republican
presidential nominee didn't take a stand against such controversial
Reagan administration policies as the sale of arms to Iran in
exchange for hostages.
   ``Where was George?'' the Massachusetts senator asked repeatedly.
   But the younger Bush, in a brief campaign stop Monday, said,
``George was right where he was supposed to be as vice president of
the United States, a loyal, solid vice president who is willing to
take the good news out of this administration, and the bad news.''
   ``And for every policy that didn't work, I hope Teddy stands up
and says, `Thank you, George,' for fighting for an economy that has
a 5.2 percent unemployment rate. Or `Thank you, George' for
fighting for a military buildup that's now kept the Russians at the
negotiating table so that for the first time in my lifetime, we
have eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.
   ``And `Thank you, George' for fighting for conservative judges
up and down the judicial system. That's what he ought to be
saying,'' he said.
   Bush, appearing with a local Republican candidate, predicted a
``tough, close election'' between his father and Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis.

<HEAD>Hunting May Be Limited for Drought-Stricken Ducks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought has reduced the expected fall duck
migration to the second smallest on record and could mean a 25
percent reduction in hunting this year, federal wildlife officials
say.
   The migration will total about 66 million ducks, according to
biologists of the Fish and Wildlife Service. Only 1985's estimated
migration of 62 million was lower, and last year's was a hopeful 74
million.
   All the decline will come in the Central and Mississippi flyways
because of steady loss of marshy breeding areas in the northern
plains states and southern Canada in the 1980s. The flight on the
Atlantic and Pacific flyways should be unchanged from last year.
   The service has been warning for weeks that major new
restrictions probably will be needed for hunting seasons starting
in October.
   States are in charge of actual hunting regulations, but they
must choose from possibilities set out by the service. Early-season
guidelines for hunting the blue-winged teal in September call for
no season at all in 13 Central and Mississippi flyway states.
   Regular-season guidelines will be decided upon next week after a
public hearing in Washington. Advisory committees meeting in Denver
on Monday were asked to discuss a 25 percent cutback in the number
of days during which duck hunting is allowed, a reduction in bag
limits from the typical four to three and an early closing of the
season on Jan. 1 instead of Jan. 20, said Megan Durham, spokeswoman
for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
   It isn't just this year's drought that has reduced breeding
activity in the marshes. There have been many dry years in this
decade, allowing farming to be extended into areas previously too
wet for crops, particularly in Canada.
   Surveys released last week showed record numbers of ducks in
northern Canada and Alaska, with populations up 9 percent there.
Those ducks couldn't find suitable areas farther south, and the
longer flights may have tired them too much to breed, biologists
fear.
   Overall, the census by U.S. and Canadian biologists showed the
breeding populations of 10 major species down 3.7 percent from last
year and 17 percent from the 1955-1987 average. There were only
2.58 million Northern pintail ducks, 18 percent fewer than last
year and 54 percent below average.
   Mallards in southern Saskatchewan fell below 1 million for the
first time.
   ``Biologists are beginning to worry that continued low water
conditions in the areas waterfowl use for migration stopovers and
wintering will concentrate the birds and make them more vulnerable
to disease later this year,'' the service said.
   Frank Dunkle, director of the service, was quoted as expecting
increased emphasis on management of wetlands for waterfowl as
provided for under the 1986 ``North American Plan'' agreement with
Canada, because such areas in many cases have provided the only
relief for drought-stressed waterfowl.
   Some other findings from the survey:
   _The Platte River in Nebraska has been turned into a ``river of
sand,'' exposing the nesting piping plover and the interior least
tern to threats of predators and death of aquatic food species.
   _Geese are faring better than ducks, since they nest on more
permanent wetlands and are better able to protect their young from
predators.
   _Flows of tributaries to the Great Lakes are so low biologists
cannot safely apply chemicals to control lamprey, which prey on
lake trout. Dredging necessitated by low water will spread
contaminated bottom sediment, threatening other aquatic life.
   _The acorn crop from oak trees in the Midwest and South could be
a near-total failure without major rain soon, spelling problems for
deer, squirrels and wild turkeys dependent on acorns for food.
   _Pheasant, quail and grouse, though doing well in Kansas and
Nebraska now, could be hurt next winter and spring through
drought-caused loss of food and cover. Poor production of pheasant,
grouse and Hungarian partridge is expected in the Dakotas.
   _Some fish won't spawn in the upper Mississippi and Missouri
rivers because of low water, and high temperatures in the Dakotas
has eliminated or reduced production of walleye, northern pike,
smallmouth bass and largemouth bass at federal hatcheries.

   The Reagan administration's top Mideast
official will meet next week with his Soviet counterpart to discuss
developments in the Persian Gulf and the stalled Arab-Israeli peace
process, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy will meet in Geneva
early next week with Vladimir Polyakov, a specialist on the Middle
East at the Soviet foreign ministry, said the official. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Murphy-Polyakov meeting is part of regularly scheduled
contacts between the two officials, although they have increased
the pace of their meetings this year, said the official. They last
met in March.
   Murphy will travel to the Mideast after the Geneva meeting, said
another official. He declined to elaborate or to be named.
   Arab-Israeli peace moves have been moribund since attempts
earlier this year by Secretary of State George Shultz to bring the
sides to the negotiating table and defuse the Palestinian uprising
in Israeli-occupied territories.
   The United States appears to have placed its peace plan on hold,
pending the outcome of general elections in both countries in
November.
   The Soviet Union is seeking an increased role in the peace
process, which so far has been dominated by the United States.
   In the Gulf, the superpowers are cooperating in supporting
attempts by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to bring
about a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq.
   The two neighbors, who have been at war for almost eight years,
agreed last week to accept a year-old U.N. cease-fire resolution
designed to end the conflict. Perez de Cuellar is meeting this week
in New York with representatives from both sides to work out
implementation of the cease-fire.
   Murphy and Polyakov are also expected to discuss implementation
of the cease-fire, as well as rehabilitation plans for the
devastated region. Japan has offered to provide financial help for
rehabilitation projects.
   The Soviets enjoy good ties with both parties, while the United
States is seeking to renew the dialogue it had with Iran before
ties were broken following the 1979 take-over of the U.S. embassy
in Tehran by Iranian militants.

   The tiny principality of
Liechtenstein on Tuesday marked the 50th anniversary of the coming
to power of Prince Franz Josef II, Europe's longest-reigning head
of state.
   Parliament held a special session in honor of the 81-year-old
monarch, and a portrait of the prince etched onto Liechtenstein
marble was unveiled in the government building in the capital,
Vaduz.
   Franz Josef is the second-longest ruling head of state in the
world, behind Japan's Emperor Hirohito, 87, who has reigned for 62
years.
   He oversees a 62-square-mile principality with a homogeneous
population of 27,000.
   Four years ago, Franz Josef turned over administrative duties to
his eldest son, Hans Adam, and since then his role largely has been
ceremonial.
   Under Franz Josef's rule, Liechtenstein moved from being a poor
agrarian state to a modern industrial nation. The prince also is
credited with resolving internal political unrest before World War
II and with keeping the principality, nestled between Switzerland
and Austria, neutral during the war.

   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar today held
the first round of peace talks on implementing a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq War.
   As he arrived at U.N. headquarters, Velayati condemned the
latest Iraqi offensive and said Iraq was jeopardizing peace efforts
by using outlawed chemical weapons.
   Perez de Cuellar said he would hold negotiations today with
Velayati on a cease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange,
formal peace talks and a U.N. peace plan. The talks had been set
for Wednesday.
   Further talks with Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq
Aziz, are to be held Wednesday.
   Aziz was scheduled to arrive in New York later today. It was not
known if he would see the secretary-general today.
   U.N. officials said Perez de Cuellar was aided by senior
political, military and legal officers. Perez de Cuellar said
Monday he is optimistic a truce date can be set within 10 days.
   Iran announced July 18 that it accepted the year-old Security
Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in the nearly
8-year-old war. Iraq previously accepted the resolution.
   Since Friday, Iraq has captured Iranian territory and prisoners
in a series of attacks but has said it did not intend to keep the
land. Iraq has said it intended to take the prisoners to improve
its bargaining position in cease-fire talks.
   ``They have intensified the war on the front ... in the last few
hours they have attacked some cities and invaded our border,''
Velayati said today.
   He said Iraqi officials declared Monday that their forces would
withdraw from Iran by midnight. However, he said, Iraq invaded two
northwestern cities ``and still the war is going on very seriously
and they have used chemical weapons on a large scale.''
   Velayati declined to answer reporters' questions about the
possibility of restoring a dialogue with the United States.
   Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said
today it would be ``very difficult'' for the United States to
normalize relations with Iran before the nine U.S. hostages were
freed from captivity in Lebanon.
   ``There's no question that the people that are holding the
hostages have some kind of allegiance or connection with Iran,''
Walters said in an interview on CBS' ``This Morning.''
   ``I think it would be very dfficult for us to justify anything
unless they released the hostages,'' he said.
   The longest-held among the 18 foreign hostages believed held in
Lebanon is Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman on Monday reaffirmed
the U.S. willingness to hold a dialogue with Iran. He told
reporters the United States sent Iran a message last week raising
the possibility of talks, but no reply had yet been received.
   The United States broke diplomatic relations with Tehran after
Iranian revolutionaries stormed the U.S. Embassy there in 1980 and
took hostages. The last 52 U.S. hostages in Iran were freed 444
days later.
   A seven-member U.N. team, meanwhile, arrived in Tehran today to
work out the technical details of the cease-fire and was to visit
Baghdad later in the week.
   U.N. team leader Lt. Gen. Martin Vadset said he would explore
ways to implement and maintain a truce, Iran's Islamic Republic
News Agency reported in a dispatch monitored in Cyprus.
   Five of the officials are from the Jerusalem-based U.N. Truce
Supervision Organization and two are from United Nations
headquarters in New York.
   Other U.N. experts already were in Tehran to determine the
status of prisoners of war. An exchange of prisoners is a key
aspect of the U.N. cease-fire resolution.

   The Senate today side-stepped a controversial
pension issue during debate on the fiscal 1989 health and human
services spending bill, after having rejected attempts to terminate
the nation's family planning program.
   The massive $137 billion bill, which also contains money for the
departments of labor and education, is traditionally a lightning
rod for controversy.
   President Reagan has said he would veto the entire bill based on
a Senate provision permitting Medicaid funds for abortions where
pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Current law permits
payments only where the life of the mother is endangered.
   Senators agreed today to leave out another provision opposed by
Reagan, a one-year moratorium on companies cashing out overfunded
pension plans. The Senate Appropriations Committee had approved the
moratorium, but the full Senate instead passed a resolution
directing the Finance Committee to deal with the issue.
   Hundreds of companies have dipped into their plans and labor
leaders say the money is often used for mergers or other business
moves not in workers' interests. ``Company after company has turned
its pension plan into a piggybank'' while paying meager benefits to
retirees, said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chief sponsor of the
provision.
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., a leading opponent of the moratorium,
said the Metzenbaum approach would have encouraged companies to
underfund their plans. He also said the Appropriations Committee
had no expertise in the complicated area of pension law.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., lost attempts Monday to eliminate the
$140 million Title X family planning program and to require
unmarried minors seeking contraceptives from federally funded
clinics to have written parental consent.
   The Senate voted 65-21 against getting rid of Title X and 54-34
against the mandatory parental consent proposal.
   In other action Monday on the labor-HHS spending bill, the
Senate approved by voice vote an abortion ``conscience clause''
sponsored by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.
   The provision says none of the money in the bill can be used to
require any person or entity to perform or facilitate abortions. It
applies to medical personnel or denominational hospitals with
religious or moral objections to abortion.
   Title X provides money to states, local health departments and
private groups for family planning clinics serving primarily
low-income women.
   Helms alleged that Title X recipients are using federal funds
for abortion-related services and for ``secret sex programs for our
nation's teen-agers.''
   ``The federal government takes money from American parents and
then uses that money to give contraceptives ... to their
children,'' Helms said. ``This is wrong. This is immoral.''
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., countered that ``Title X is not an
abortion program. It's a knowledge program. It has been enormously
successful.''

   Six stolen artworks discovered a year ago hidden in
the Paris home of an Italian have been returned to Italy, the
Cultural Ministry announced Tuesday.
   A 15th century triptych by Gabriele di Francesco was among the
works. The painting, in three side-by-side panels, was stolen in
1985 from the altar of the Cathedral of Roniglione, 33 miles north
of Rome.
   A 15th century painting by Francesco Raibolini, three 17th
century compasses with ivory cases, and Francesco Netti's 1800
``Procession of Penance During the 1794 Eruption of Vesuvius'' also
were recovered. The three were stolen from Italy between June 1983
and August 1984.
   The Italian news ANSA said the works were found in the home of
Giambattista Ongaro. It quoted Culture Ministry officials as saying
several other works that had been exported illegally from Italy
also were found in the home.
   No charges were filed against Ongaro. The ministry said there no
evidence to link him to the thefts.

<HEAD>Bentsen Panel Moves To Fix Errors In '86 Tax Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday
stripped away all issues of controversy and unanimously approved a
bill correcting hundreds of errors in the 1986 tax overhaul law.
   The chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, won quick approval of
the bill by promising colleagues that the committee staff would
attempt to put together a separate package of their favorite
unrelated tax provisions. If such a package could win approval of a
majority of the panel, Bentsen said, it could be offered as an
amendment when the bill reaches the Senate floor, perhaps in
September.
   That package likely would include amendments to permanently free
about 20 million mutual fund shareholders from a tax on certain
fund operating expenses and to allow free-lance writers and artists
to deduct expenses before a book or painting starts producing
income.
   Most of the Finance Committee's bill is designed to correct
mistakes in the 1986 law, but there is a new provision which
   would exempt farmers and some other diesel users from paying tax
on fuel used for off-road purposes. A 1987 law requires that such
users pay the tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and apply for a refund at
year-end.
   ``This is the last major piece of legislation we expect to come
out of this committee this year,'' said Bentsen, the running mate
of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. He cautioned
that many tax incentives that members want to add to the bill
cannot be accepted because of budget constraints.
   While members of the committee probably would have no trouble
agreeing on some relatively small selective tax increases, Bentsen
said, the problem would come in deciding which of many pet tax
incentives would go into the final bill.
   ``Unless we follow what you suggest,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood of
Oregon, senior Republican on the committee, ``we will have no bill
at all.''
   The committee's action left in doubt the fate of several major
provisions that the House Ways and Means Committee added to its own
version of the ``technical corrections'' bill.
   These include tax credits for business research and
experimentation, for owners of low-income rental housing and for
employers that hire the poor, as well as a tax exemption for bonds
used to help low-income families buy their first home.
   The Ways and Means Committee also approved several tax increases
to pay for those and other incentives. Those provisions range from
a new tax of $2.67 on a pound of pipe tobacco to a reduction in tax
benefits for single-premium life insurance policies.
   ``There is a whole litany of things we would like to do but were
are not going to be able to get them in'' this bill, Bentsen said.
   Accountants and tax lawyers are especially eager to have the
technical-corrections bill enacted because many provisions in the
massive 1986 law are unclear or ambiguous.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ordered state Rep.
Thomas Reed's extortion trial moved from Montgomery to Mobile after
Reed's attorneys complained that pre-trial publicity made a fair
trial impossible.
   The veteran Tuskegee lawmaker is also president of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Alabama.
   He is charged with accepting $10,000 in cash and between $5,000
and $10,000 in restaurant equipment from the family of convicted
murderer Anthony Dennis Chesser to secure his early release from
prison.
   Reed was scheduled for trial Aug. 8, but U.S. District Judge
Joel Dubina moved it to Sept. 26 in Mobile. Dubina will still
preside.
   The six week delay is to allow one of Reed's defense attorneys,
former Lt. Gov. Bill Baxley, to recover from a bleeding ulcer.
   In a court hearing today, Reed's defense team presented two
television reporters who testified about the extensive coverage
Reed's case received on their Montgomery stations.
   A private investigator working for Reed's lawyers said he had
interviewed more than 300 people in central and south Alabama about
the Reed case and at least 90 percent were convinced Reed was
guilty.
   Private investigator Sam Wright said the least opinionated
people he found in his survey were in the Mobile area.
   After listening to the testimony Dubina agreed to move the trial.
   ``I think that's some indication the judge agrees Mr. Reed has
been mistreated, or treated differently,'' Baxley said.

   Sein Lwin first rose to prominence in
Burma by commanding an army company that shot and killed 22
protesting students in a 1962 riot at Rangoon University.
   Last March, when thousands of students went on a rampage in some
of the worst rioting in Burma's history, it again was Sein Lwin who
led the forces that put them down.
   Analysts had suggested the 64-year-old hardliner would be a
logical scapegoat as the government of Ne Win, his close ally,
sought to appease critics and stabilize the country.
   Instead, Sein Lwin emerged Tuesday as Burma's most powerful
leader, succeeding Ne Win, who resigned Saturday.
   The new chairman of the Burma Socialist Program Party _
virtually the country's sole political institution _ is like almost
all of its members a retired military officer.
   He joined the army in 1942 when Burmese officers, including Ne
Win, were siding with Japan against the Allies _ specifically
Britain, which had colonized the onetime kingdom.
   As the war progressed, the officers switched allegiance to the
Allies, realizing Japan posed as much a threat to Burmese
independence as had the British. Independence from Britain in 1948
was followed by a chaotic, 14-year experiment with democracy.
   That experiment ended in 1962, the year Ne Win seized power in a
military coup and began to enforce his brand of economic socialism,
military-backed authoritarian rule and isolation from much of the
world.
   That same year, Sein Lwin led his army unit in quelling the
protest at Rangoon University, firmly establishing his reputation
as an unbending leader prepared to wield an iron fist to root out
opposition.
   Little has been pubished about Sein Lwin and others in Burma's
senior hierarchy, most of whom live secluded lives away from the
public eye.
   Sein Lwin retired from the army and in 1977 became a member of
the party's guiding body, the Central Executive Committee. He took
the No. 4 party slot of joint general secretary in 1985.
   Also in 1985, he was named secretary of the Council of State,
the No. 3 position in the government after president and vice
president. The 28-member council directs all state organs.
   He has also held ministerial portfolios for cooperatives,
transport, communications, and home affairs.
   On March 18, in a day that was later dubbed ``Bloody Friday,''
thousands of students stormed through downtown Rangoon, burning
cars and shouting anti-government slogans for the second time in
three months.
   The ``Lon Htein,'' or riot police, were called out, reinforced
by regular army units and armored vehicles. According to Western
diplomatic and Burmese sources, Sein Lwin commanded the police from
a tactical command headquarters at the government broadcast station.
   Sein Lwin overruled some leaders who wanted to handle the riot
more leniently, the sources said. The government has since admitted
to 43 deaths but more than 100 people are believed to have been
killed.
   Analysts, among them the respected Hong Kong-based Far Eastern
Economic Review, had suggested Sein Lwin would take the fall for
the violence, which deepened anti-government sentiments.
   Home Minister Min Goung resigned, several other officials were
sacked or reprimanded. On Tuesday, the nation's prime minister and
attorney general were dismissed in connection with the riots, and
Sein Lwin emerged as leader.

<TEXT>
   NASA has selected two sites in Mississippi as
the best locations for proposed government-owned facilities for the
production and testing of a new space shuttle solid rocket motor,
the space agency announced today.
   A location in northeastern Mississippi known as Yellow Creek was
selected as a production site for the space shuttle advanced solid
rocket motor, NASA said, and the Stennis Space Center near Bay St.
Louis, Miss., has been selected as a site for the testing of the
motor.
   Yellow Creek is owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, and
Stennis is a NASA facility.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said work at
the Yellow Creek site could provide about 1,400 new jobs, and an
additional 600 jobs would be created at Bay St. Louis.
   The space shuttle advanced solid rocket motor is planned to
replace the current redesigned shuttle rocket motor in the
mid-1990s. The advanced motor is expected to provide more
reliability and safety, and enable the space shuttle to carry more
cargo into orbit.
   Under the NASA advanced rocket motor plan, the space agency will
now ask for contract proposals for work on the rocket motor at the
two Mississippi sites. Companies will be asked to make bids on
building a government-owned facility that would be operated by the
contractor.
   Companies may also propose that the work be done in facilities
built and owned by contractors at a privately owned site of the
contractor's choosing.
   After evaluating the options, NASA will make a final decision on
the advanced solid rocket motor contract.
   NASA said that an advanced solid rocket motor program in
Mississippi will make ``maximum utilization'' of the Michoud
Assembly Facility and the Slidell Computer Complex, both located
nearby in southeastern Louisiana.

<HEAD>Study Says Many Lower Back Disc Operations May Be Unnecessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The spine specialist who prescribed back
surgery for football star Joe Montana says at least twice as many
operations as necessary are performed for ruptured discs in the
lower back.
   Dr. Jeffrey Saal of the San Francisco Spine Institute said
surgeons generally use the wrong criteria in deciding to operate.
He reported findings of his three-year study, co-written with his
brother, Dr. Joel Saal, to the North American Spine Society in
Colorado Springs, Colo., on Monday.
   These include severe pain, leg weakness, failure to respond to
bed rest and diagnostic exams showing a fragment of the disc's
nucleus has broken through the disc wall and is pressing against a
nerve root.
   None of those, Saal said, should be used as overwhelming
evidence that surgery is needed. Instead, the decision should be
based on the patients' level of function and whether that can be
improved by an active rehabilitation program, he said.
   ``More than 20 percent of patients with (lower back) disc
problems have surgery but less than 10 percent may really need it
if there are no other problems, such as stenosis, or narrowing of
the spine,'' Saal said in an interview.
   Other studies have noted the presence of stenosis as a reason
for failed lumbar disc surgery and estimated the presence of
stenosis in 30 percent of those patients.
   Rapid, progressive weakness in the leg is an indication surgery
is needed, Saal said. Montana had those symptoms, along with
stenosis, before his surgery in 1986.
   Montana's back surgery was so successful, it was commonly
referred to on the sports pages as a ``miracle.'' At mid-season,
doctors said the surgery would sideline him for the rest of the
year, possibly forever. But he was back on the field in weeks to
lead the 49ers in the playoffs.
   Most patients with ruptured lumbar discs have less severe
symptoms and can return to work and sports within four months after
starting active, non-operative treatment, Saal said.
   ``He's probably correct,'' said Frances Conley, chief of
neurosurgery at the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital and associate
professor of surgery at Stanford University. ``Far too much surgery
has been done on lumbar discs, and we're becoming more aware about
how much it's been overdone now because we have better tools, such
as magnetic resonance imaging.''
   Saal's treatment included teaching patients how to reduce the
risks of further injury, training for spine stabilization and
exercises to develop overall body strength and flexibility while
the disc heals itself. Injections or drugs sometimes were used to
block pain and reduce swelling.
   Such treatment, he said, can cost up to $3,500, compared with
more than $30,000 for surgery and post-operative care, while
involving much less risk.
   More than 2 million Americans suffer from ruptured discs in
their necks and lower backs, and they spend more than $3 billion
annually on lumbar disc treatment, according to the American
Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.
   An estimated 237,000 operations on discs in the neck and back
were performed in 1986, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics.
   Ronald Mortara, neurosurgeon at University Hospital in Boston
and associate professor at the Boston University School of
Medicine, said he agreed that lumbar disc surgery is sometimes
performed unnecessarily but was unaware of any studies indicating
how often that occurs.
   But he was skeptical of Saal's claim that 90 percent of lumbar
disc patients could be healed without surgery if they have severe
pain.
   ``We're quite conservative here, as a rule,'' he said. ``But if
the patients have failed bed rest, physical therapy, pain
medication, antispasm drugs and are out of work and can't do the
things they like, then surgery is probably indicated.''
   Saal's study, based on 59 patients averaging 35 years old and
thought to be free of stenosis, found their symptoms _ sciatic pain
in their toes, legs or buttocks, a tingling sensation in their toes
and weakness in their feet _ lasted an average of five months.
   Only six patients required surgery after the non-operative
program, but four of those were found to have stenosis.
   Eighteen patients asked surgeons for a second opinion of their
cases and all were recommended for surgery as soon as possible to
avoid long term complications. Fifteen of those, however, rated
themselves good or excellent after treatment without surgery.

<TEXT>
   The Blue Diamond Coal Co. said it will
build a $20 million plant that will process 1,250 tons of coal an
hour.
   Construction is to begin in July 1989 at Beech Fork Hollow in
southeastern Kentucky and be finished by October 1990, Everett
Kelly, Blue Diamond's general manager of mines. said Monday.
   Kelly said the plant should help the Knoxville, Tenn.-based
company expand to meet the needs of more utilities. The plant,
which would be among the largest in the eastern United States, will
provide 2 million to 3 million tons of coal a year, Kelly said.
   Kelly said the facility could allow the company to hire more
people to work in Blue Diamond's mines. But the plant itself will
be highly automated and may employ fewer people than now run the
company's grinding and washing plant at Leatherwood, he said.
   The company also plans to develop a $12 million longwall mining
system at two new eastern Kentucky mines.
   A longwall uses a large cutting machine that runs back and forth
on a track, shearing hundreds of tons of coal off a seam as it
passes. Hydraulic systems keep the track _ and temporary, metal
roof supports above it _ advancing as the machine cuts into the
seam.
   Blue Diamond will finance the projects with roughly $30 million
it received from the Georgia Power Co. when that utility bought
itself out of a high-cost contract last year.

   Rains have relieved ``drought stress'' in
parts of the Corn Belt, but crops have shown little improvement, a
report by the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   ``The precipitation gave most crops a boost in the central and
southern Great Plains, Delta and Southeast,'' the report said.
``Soil moisture improved but was still mostly short in the eastern
half of the nation.''
   In the central and eastern Corn Belt, rain during the week of
July 18-24 may have come too late to improve corn harvest
prospects, the report said.
   Soybeans were reported in ``mostly fair'' condition but showed
little improvement as a result of rain in the central and eastern
Corn Belt areas, the report said. However, soybeans continued to
improve in the Great Plains, where the crop was reported in ``good
to fair'' shape.
   Livestock was reported in ``mostly fair'' condition. Recent
rains have helped pastures, although forage was still in short
supply.
   The facility is operated jointly by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the Agriculture Department.

   The House Judiciary Committee today approved
17 articles of impeachment against U.S. District Judge Alcee L.
Hastings of Miami, and sent the historic bribery case to the full
House.
   Hastings, 51, is the first federal judge to face impeachment
after his acquittal in a criminal trial on the same charges, and
the first black to face removal from federal office under the
impeachment procedure.
   In Miami, Hastings said that those who voted against him ``acted
in blind ignorance. They could not have read the material.''
   The committee voted 32-1 to approve all the 17 impeachment
articles.
   A number of committee members said they had done considerable
soul searching because they feared Hastings may have been correct
in his assertion that he was the victim of racism. But those
expressing such reservations said that factual circumstances of the
case showed impeachment was warranted.
   Hastings would be removed from his lifetime office if the full
House votes for impeachment and he is convicted in a Senate trial.
   Hastings is accused of conspiring to solicit a bribe from two
defendants who appeared before him and of lying about the scheme to
a federal jury. He also is accused of leaking information about a
wiretap.
   William Borders, a Washington attorney accused of participating
with Hastings in the bribery scheme, has been convicted of the
charges. Hastings, in a separate 1983 trial, was acquitted.
   The first of the articles of impeachment, which are similar to
an indictment, accused Hastings of engaging in a corrupt conspiracy
to obtain a $150,000 bribe from two brothers. Other articles
accused him of lying about the scheme at his trial by denying
specific parts of the conspiracy; of leaking wiretap information;
and of undermining the confidence of the federal judiciary.
   Eleven impeachment cases have come to trial before the Senate,
and five defendants, all judges, have been removed from office.

<TEXT>
   A screenwriter wants his home town to be
in pictures, but he has encountered some reluctant stars.
   Public and private school officials are concerned about the
script, in which students flout authority to keep their school from
closing.
   ``We'll be equated to whatever takes place'' in the film, said
Sister Kevyn Maiers, administrator at Cathedral High School, where
much of the filming would take place.
   There's another set of problems at Apollo High School, where
screenwriter Steve Sommers was graduated in 1976.
   ``The script calls for a car on the football field. Especially
during the time of football season, that creates some concern,''
said Kathy Zavala, community relations specialist for St. Cloud's
public school district.
   The moviemakers would like to film two Apollo football games,
but don't want to become the main attraction themselves at the
games, she said.
   But Sommers, writer-director of ``Catch Me If You Can,'' says
the script is ``very innocent.''
   ``In the end, the school principal is the hero. He's revered
throughout,'' Sommers said Tuesday from his office in the Los
Angeles area, where casting is under way.
   Sommers wouldn't reveal many details about the script, but said
it's generally ``about a principal who believes in kids and kids
believe in him. And there's a romance about two kids from the
opposite sides of the track who get together to do something
positive'' to keep their school open.
   ``There's no sex at all. There's a big kiss at the end,''
Sommers added.
   About two weeks of filming in St. Cloud would begin in
September, and the public and private school boards are expected to
decide in the next few weeks whether to approve the project.
   Sommers, who also graduated from St. John's University at
Collegeville, said he expects approval.
   ``It'll be great for the school. I'm from St. Cloud and I'd
never do anything to offend or embarrass anybody there. I love my
home town. My family still lives there,'' he said.

   When a bicyclist grabbed 80-year-old Sara
Foster's purse as she was walking home from the grocery store, Lee
Dowd raced to the rescue. So did Jack Price. So did three
construction workers.
   ``This is one grateful old lady,'' Mrs. Foster said, recounting
the events of Monday.
   She said she had set her shopping bag down on a fire hydrant,
put her purse inside it ``and I took about four steps when that
young man came by ... just picked my purse right out, right out of
the bag, and kept on going.''
   Ms. Dowd, 34, was driving by when she saw the man steal the
purse and she began chasing him.
   ``The creep,'' she said. ``I figured he could ride his bike for
as long as he wanted to but I could chase him. I thought about
hitting him, but I didn't do it because I knew I'd get sued.''
   Price, 30, was driving behind Ms. Dowd, and he too gave chase.
   ``Hang on tight,'' he told his 6- and 8-year-old daughters. ``A
lady's in trouble.''
   Trapped in a cul-de-sac, the bicyclist ditched the purse and
jumped over a fence.
   Mrs. Dowd returned the purse, containing $26 and eyeglasses, to
Mrs. Foster. Meanwhile, Price gunned his car around the block to
catch the thief on the other side, but missed him.
   He asked several construction workers if they had seen a guy in
a plaid shirt.
   Clint Hutchinson began looking for him, saw the man peeking
around the corner of an apartment building and ran toward him.
Hutchinson also yelled to an elderly man on his front porch to call
police.
   Two other construction workers, Kevin Godfrey, 18, and Tom
Haywiser, 28, sprinted toward the man in the plaid shirt. ``You
know anything about a purse-snatching?'' they yelled.
   ``I don't want no drugs,'' the man hollered back, and he ran,
with the pair right behind.
   Half a mile later, Godfrey tackled the man in a mall.
   ``The security guard walked up to me. He didn't know what to
think. I was huffing and puffing and all I could say was `Call the
police,''' Godfrey said.
   But officers John Bowden and Darrell Hasty were already there.
The elderly man and at least two other residents had been phoning
details of the chase along the way.
   Jackie Lee Hadley, 19, was arrested and in the Orange County
Jail without bond Tuesday, charged with strong-arm robbery.

   The Williamsburg Bridge, closed when inspectors
discovered such extensive corrosion they feared it might collapse,
was reopened Tuesday following nearly $10 million in surface work.
   ``The bridge is now stronger than it's been since World War
II,'' said Transportation Commissioner Ross Sandler, who watched
the first cars roll over the span linking Brooklyn and Manhattan at
7:45 a.m.
   The bridge was built in 1903 for bicycles and horse-drawn
buggies. By the time it was closed April 12 it was carrying more
than 100,000 vehicles and 420 trains daily.
   The closing of the bridge affected millions of daily commuters
not only on that structure but on the neighboring Manhattan and
Brooklyn bridges, to which displaced traffic was rerouted.
   Two lanes for motorists were opened in May and another two in
June. Tuesday's ceremony marked the opening of all eight lanes to
cars. Brooklyn-bound trucks remain forbidden, but should be allowed
on the bridge by mid-August, Sandler said.
   Sandler said the city was able to complete the work two weeks
ahead of schedule because contractors and city employees worked
seven days a week, adding some 150 tons of steel to the structure.
   More extensive, long-term work _ particularly on the approach
roadways leading to the bridge _ is still needed, Sandler said.
   A $350 million, seven-year project will begin once federal and
state funds are secured. Closures then will be one lane at a time,
he said.
   ``We now know what we need to do to preserve this bridge,'' said
Sandler. ``When we're done it will be like new and should last
hundreds of years _ if we take care of it.''

   Contaminated rainwater in the slums of
New Delhi is blamed by city officials for an epidemic of
water-borne diseases that killed 14 more lives Tuesday, bringing
the death toll to 157.
   At least 317 people suffering from gastroenteritis and cholera
were hospitalized Tuesday and that the epidemic is spreading to new
areas of the Indian capital.
   More than 4,400 residents, mostly children, are hospitalized
with the diseases, caused by contaminated water from monsoon rains
that has seeped into the city's primitive pipes and wells.
   About 1,200 new cases were reported Monday from nine areas of
New Delhi with a combined population of half a million people. Most
of the earlier cases were reported from only two neighborhoods.
   More than 11,700 people have sought treatment since July 9.
   Officials say they have inoculated more than 200,000 people to
halt the spread of the diseases.
   Dr. Raj Saxena, a physician in the district of Sunder Nagri,
says he and his team are inoculating 30 people every hour.
   ``But it seems it's not working,'' he said. ``Frankly speaking,
the situation is out of our hands. The damage has been done, we are
just trying to check it.''
   Hit hardest by the epidemic are slums built after 1975 in
outlying areas to the east.
   Of New Delhi's 8 million people, 2.4 million people live in
slums, 25 percent of which have no power supply, 49 percent no tap
water and 32 percent no toilet facilities.
   The impoverished Nand Nagri district, east of the Yamuna River,
was the first area hit by the epidemic and is worst-affected. It
has 50,000 residents.
   Garbage in the area has not been collected for four or five
months after a dispute between the Delhi Development Authority and
the Municipal Corp. over which agency was responsible for the slum
areas.
   Health officials say rain water flowing through garbage and
sewage into shallow wells is spreading the diseases among the
congested dwellings.
   Health officials ordered city wells shut off and water tanked
in. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi toured the area last week and
ordered the garbage cleared.
   But the Indian Express newspaper reported Tuesday that the slums
``still looked like cesspools.''
   Dr. T.S. Rana, a private physician with a clinic in Nand Nagri,
said the number of cases may be greater than reported.
   ``At least four to five people are dying of cholera from this
area daily who are not reported,'' he said.
   ``People here do not have money to take patients to hospitals,''
he said. ``They try the local doctors and then just pray, and
cholera is a disease which does not respond to prayer.''
   The monsoon rains began in New Delhi in the last week of June.

<TEXT>
   Prairie House, the mountain retreat
of the late Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, is for sale
for $275,000.
   ``Part of me hopes nobody will buy it, but I just can't get out
there enough,'' said the owner, Cathleen Douglas Stone, the fourth
and last wife of the late jurist.
   Now practicing law in Boston and married to an insurance
executive, she spent her first honeymoon at Goose Prairie in 1966
as the 23-year-old bride of Douglas, then 67. Title to Prairie
House passed to her when Douglas died in 1980.
   The house came on the market during the last three to four
weeks, said Muff Rouse, owner of Heritage Brokers Inc. and listing
agent for the home. Rouse said she has had many inquiries and is
working on one offer but has declined to speculate when she would
sell the house.
   She noted it is in a remote area with the nearest phone 14 miles
away. ``It could be frustrating if you need access to
communication,'' Rouse said.
   The Swiss-style chalet sits in a meadow facing the snow-covered
flanks of Old Scab, Buffalo Hump and Old Bald in this hamlet east
of Mount Rainier National Park.
   The eight-acre property also includes a small barn and a tree
stump bearing a plaque that reads, ``Absolutely Nothing Happened on
this Spot, Sept. 6, 1859.''
   ``Goose Prairie is my place in a sense that Washington, D.C.,
never could be,'' Douglas wrote in his autobiography ``Go East,
Young Man.''
   Of the setting in the Bumping River valley, he wrote, ``Nursery
of splendid trees. Garden of brilliant flowers. Abode of birds
without number. Greenhouse for succulent mushrooms. Gateway to wild
and high country.''
   The house has three fireplaces. The back of the property borders
the 166,000-acre William O. Douglas Wilderness Area, established
and named after his death.
   Douglas grew to love the area as a teen-ager in Yakima, about 50
miles to the east, hiking the rugged terrain to strenthen his legs
after a bout with polio.
   It was from his summer home in August 1970 that he ruled the
bombing of Cambodia, ordered by President Richard M. Nixon, was
illegal _ a finding overturned within six hours by the eight other
justices in a telephone conference.
   Stone a time when she and Douglas were camped on Bismarck Peak.
   ``He saw these guys dressed in business suits who had hiked up
to our camp. `Tell 'em I'm the wrangler,' he muttered,'' she said.
   After hearing what the lawyers had to say, Douglas told them he
was headed for a still more remote camp but promised to write a
legal opinion and leave it in a tree stump.
   ``The next day, only one of the attorneys was in shape to hike
back up to camp,'' said Kay Kershaw, a neighbor who also recalled
the incident. ``As promised, the opinion was waiting in the stump.
He turned them down.''

<HEAD>Fourth Fly Found; Helicopters Spray Suburban Area</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fourth Mediterranean fruit fly was found
just hours before a pair of helicopters sprayed presticide over a
16-square-mile suburban area, but officials said Tuesday they don't
plan to repeat the airborne effort.
   The next step in efforts to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit
fly, one of the most destructive crop-destroying insects, will be
the release next week of about 20 million cobalt-treated sterile
flies, said Bill Edwards, chief deputy for the Los Angeles County
Department of Agriculture.
   After that, he said, there will be daily releases of sterile
flies to prevent females that escape the poison from reproducing.
   The fourth Medfly was found Monday in a peach tree at a home in
the San Fernando Valley community of Reseda, a quarter-mile west of
the zone treated with the pesticide malathion.
   Gov. George Deukmejian proclaimed a state of emergency for the
county last week after two female Medflies were found in traps. The
proclamation was a necessary step for spraying the pesticide. A
third Medfly, a male, was found Monday morning about a mile from
where the two females were found July 20.
   The helicopters, laden with 1,100 gallons of the malathion mixed
with a corn-syrup bait, began spraying the infested area at 10 p.m.
Monday and finished early Tuesday.
   Each helicopter made three passes at 500 feet over the area,
said Edwards.
   ``There were no complications. It was a good, clean operation,''
he said.
   The Medfly, common in Hawaii and probably carried into Southern
California on fruit brought in by tourists, has a potential for
spreading rapidly.
   The insect is considered a major threat to California's
multibillion-dollar agricultural industry. In 1981, California
spent about $100 million to eradicate a statewide Medfly
infestation that destroyed $100 million in crops.
   Meanwhile, concerned residents deluged hospitals and the
county's Medfly hot line with questions about possible health
hazards from the spraying.
   ``We've had a few _ a few thousand calls,'' said Robert
Dingfelder, a county agricultural inspector.
   Medical experts say most residents need not fear the pesticide,
which has been diluted to about one ounce for every acre of land
sprayed. Only people with serious respiratory ailments might be
affected, doctors said.
   Nonetheless, officials advised residents to hose down lawns
after the spraying, especially if they have pets, and to cover
their cars because the spray can corrode auto paint.

   Gunmen shot and killed a U.S. Air
Force sergeant while he was jogging with his dogs near Clark Air
Base, in an incident that may have been caused by a marital
dispute, police said Tuesday.
   In a separate incident, police said the Filipino wife of an
American serviceman was slain Sunday near the base, about 50 miles
north of Manila.
   In a third incident, police said two Belgian Embassy officials
were shot and wounded Sunday south of the capital, and the Filipino
companion of one of them was shot dead. Police said robbery
appeared to be the motive in the last two cases.
   Tech. Sgt. Richard Blackmer, 31, of the Cleveland suburb of
Brook Park, was jogging near his home about one mile from the
base's main gate about 9:30 p.m. Monday when gunmen in a car opened
fire with M-16 rifles, killing him and his two dogs, police said.
   Investigators, who requested anonymity, said a preliminary
investigation indicated the killing may have been caused by a
marital dispute.
   They said Blackmer was estranged from his Filipino wife and was
living with another woman. Police Monday picked up the wife, Maria,
for questioning but said no charges were filed.
   Police Capt. Gener Mangune said Mrs. Blackmer refused to answer
questions and expressed resentment over receiving a smaller amount
of financial support than Blackmer was paying to his common-law
wife.
   Meanwhile, U.S. authorities said Esther Billa Heacox, 41, the
wife of Navy Petty Officer James A. Heacox, was found stabbed to
death about three miles north of Clark Air Base.
   Master Sgt. James Katzman of the Clark Public Affairs Office
said Mrs. Heacox's body was found in a car after witnesses saw two
Filipino men fleeing from the vehicle, which had run off the road.
   The woman's husband, assigned to a Navy communications station
in nearby Tarlac province, said the victim was on her way to Clark
when she was killed. He said his wife's jewelry and about $150 were
missing.
   In Manila, a gunman wounded a Belgian diplomat and shot dead his
Filipino companion, Adorata Capistrano, in an apparent robbery
attempt Sunday near the Taal volcano, a tourist resort about 30
miles south of Manila, according to a Belgian Embassy official.
   He said Benoit Standaert, second secretary at the embassy,
suffered two gunshot wounds but was released from the hospital.
   Embassy spokeswoman Marie Louise Vanherk quoted police in
Batangas province as saying that they suspected robbery was the
motive because the gunman fled with Ms. Capistrano's purse.
   Nearly 40 people have been killed in communities around Clark
Air Base this year. Police say many of the killings were blamed on
communist rebels, who have been fighting to overthrow the
Philippine government since 1969 and have threatened to attack
American military personnel.
   Blackmer was the first American service member slain in the
Philippines since October, when the rebels killed two Air Force
enlisted men, a retired Air Force sergeant and a Filipino civilian
of U.S. ancestry.
   But a Filipino investigator who requested anonymity said the
style in which Blackmer was killed and the weapons used did not fit
the pattern of guerrilla atacks.
   A base spokeswoman, Air Force Capt. Maryellen Jaddick, said U.S.
authorities had not imposed any new restrictions on the nearly
26,000 American troops, Defense Department civilians and dependents
stationed at the base.

<HEAD>Armenian Officials Condemn Activists in Territorial Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Armenia's Communist Party leaders leveled an
unusually harsh attack Tuesday on activists who sought annexation
of an Armenian region in a neighboring republic, indicating the
activists could no longer count on high-level support.
   The party position, outlined in the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda, came after Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave a
hardline speech rejecting the transfer of Nagorno-Karabakh, a
mostly Armenian enclave in the republic of Azerbaijan, to the
jurisdiction of neighboring Armenia.
   Activists in Armenia and in the disputed region itself have been
pushing for the transfer since February, and Armenia's legislature
voted in June to accept the area.
   But Azerbaijani authorities opposed the idea, and the Kremlin
last week deemed annexation ``impossible.''
   Pravda reported Tuesday that party leaders in Armenia met a day
earlier to discuss ``the instigatory character of speeches at
meetings'' held in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
   The leaders ``condemned the extremist, instigatory, politically
harmful speeches and urged ... all the ideological agencies to
launch effective efforts to expose the anti-people character ... of
the activists,'' Pravda reported.
   About three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's 162,000 residents are
Armenians, and they have complained of discrimination at the hands
of Azerbaijani authorities. Armenians are mostly Christian, while
Azerbaijan is predominantly Moslem.
   Widespread general strikes and work stoppages that have
disrupted the disputed region for two months began subsiding
Monday, when Tass said 78 percent of the region's workers showed up
at their jobs.
   On Tuesday, more than 85 percent of the first-shift workers in
the 17 largest factories in Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's main
city, reported for work, Tass said.
   It said all the region's factories, stores, service shops and
public transport agencies were working for the second day in a row.
   Some Armenians have vowed to continue the fight for annexation,
but central authorities have made it clear that police will come
down harder on future demonstrations or strikes.
   The Tass report from Stepanakert indicated Communist Party
leaders were conducting a mass campaign to persuade
Nagorno-Karabakh's residents that the Kremlin's rejection of their
demands was correct.
   Activists in Yerevan called last week for a five-day strike to
protest the July 18 decision by the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, but most residents ignored the call.

<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin has announced a bid
for a third two-year term, promising to work for a universal health
care plan similar to that recently adopted in Massachusetts.
   ``It's a basic need that must be met,'' the 54-year-old Democrat
said in a speech delivered Monday at Burlington's new community
boathouse. ``Every Vermonter has the right to good health care
services, and no Vermonter should be denied such services because
he or she can't pay for them.''
   Also on the agenda is implementation of a controversial law to
control growth, which Kunin championed during the last legislative
session. The law requires that communities planning for growth
follow specific guidelines. It also increased the property transfer
tax to help pay for planning.
   Kunin doesn't have a challenger in the September primary
election. She is likely to face House Republican Leader Michael
Bernhardt of Londonderry in November. Bernhardt also is unopposed
in the primary.
   Kunin said after her speech that she did not have a specific
plan to fund the health care program but suggested that it would be
funded jointly by the public and private sectors.
   The Massachusetts law requires the state by 1992 to arrange
pooled insurance for small businesses and individuals, which
participants can buy on a sliding fee scale based on income.
   The law also requires businesses with more than five full-time
employees to offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment
surcharge to help the state provide coverage to the uninsured.
   Kunin is a strong backer of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
the Democratic presidential nominee.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian Prime Minister Karoly Grosz dampened
expectations Tuesday of a unilateral withdrawal of Soviet troops
from his Warsaw Pact country, saying any withdrawal of the Red Army
should be linked to troop reductions elsewhere in Europe.
   Grosz said he had talked about the presenceof 65,000 Soviet
troops in Hungary with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and ``we
agreed to continue this discussion.''
   But in a speech and a news conference in Washington on Tuesday,
Grosz, who heads the Hungarian Communist Party, said, ``To withdraw
forces from Hungary, others would have to be disbanded as well.''
   He plugged hard for U.S. trade and promised widespread economic
and political reforms while acknowledging Hungary was plagued with
problems of alcohol and stagnant factories.
   Grosz said the Hungarian constitution would be revised next year
and that four times as many Hungarians were permitted to leave the
country to visit abroad in the first half of this year than in the
first six months of 1987.
   Grosz in May succeeded Janos Kadar, who took charge in Budapest
in 1956 as Soviet troops suppressed what Grosz called a
``counterrevolutionary'' uprising.
   He will see President Reagan on Wednesday and has spent a week
traveling in the United States sampling the products of capitalism
and committing Hungary to a more independent course than the
country followed under Kadar.
   Explaining Hungary's economic problems, Grosz said the country
had not moved fast enough on the political front to expand the
rights of the individual workers and factory managers to make their
own decisions.
   ``Political without economic reform, no, it's not possible,'' he
said, speaking through a translator.
   On the same theme, Grosz said, ``The two processes must be
fitted to each other. You cannot separate them practically.
Political and economic endeavors take place in one body.''
   He said writers were gaining more freedom and all Hungarians
were able to express their views, although the Communist Party also
retains the right to do so.
   At the same time, Grosz said works by Hungarian expatriates were
not permitted into the country ``if they are against the
constitution'' and that he was against removing Hungary from the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Speculation that Gorbachev would withdraw the Red Army
unilaterally from Hungary has circulated for at least a month. U.S.
officials, citing intelligence sources, kept the rumors moving. But
they have not panned out.
   Grosz's remarks suggested Gorbachev would blend any withdrawal
from Hungary into larger negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact on an overall reduction of conventional troops, armor and
aircraft in Europe.
   No date has been set for negotiations, with the chief stumbling
block a U.S. demand that the Soviets agree to hold simultaneous
talks about human rights improvements at home and in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>IBM To Build Highly Automated Air Traffic Control System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. has
landed a $3.6 billion contract for a computer system that will
replace voice communications between air traffic controllers and
pilots with electronic messages and eventually may usher in the use
of computers to actually direct aircraft.
   The system, expected to be in full operation at the turn of the
century, also would give controllers advance warning of overcrowded
air traffic conditions.
   An IBM executive called the contract the largest ever received
by the company and officials said it was the largest ever awarded
by the Transportation Department.
   IBM bested Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of General Motors
Corp., for the 10-year contract to develop the Advanced Automation
System for the Federal Aviation Administration. IBM had spent $233
million of the FAA's money and about $80 million of its own in the
competition.
   The system, which is to be developed by IBM and more than a
dozen subcontractors, is designed to provide controllers with more
modern computer capacity and flexibility to handle increased air
traffic loads.
   The project outlined in the contract is expected to be completed
in 1998, although other enhancements are likely to be made after
that to meet additional requirements, officials said. The new
system is to be introduced in 1992 when it is scheduled to be
installed at the FAA's air traffic control center in Seattle.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor called the new system ``a
significant milestone and a historic step toward the future'' of
air traffic control.
   The new computer system and radar screens will allow controllers
to use modern computer terminals and provide clearer displays,
weather information and eventually the means to predict when
airspace is expected to become crowded, FAA officials said.
Controllers eventually will communicate with aircraft by data link
_ computer messages _ instead of by voice.
   Although planners envision eventual modifications that would
allow the computers to talk directly to aircraft through data
links, McArtor said there always will be ``a controller in the
loop.'' The new technology will allow controllers ``to work smarter
not harder,'' McArtor said.
   The FAA estimates that the increased automation represented by
the new system would reduce the number of additional controllers
needed over the next 20 years.
   Mimi Dawson, deputy secretary of transporation, called the
system to be provided by IBM ``an entirely new generation of air
traffic control hardware and software'' that will ``provide the
capacity needed for continually increasing air traffic well into
the next century while substantially enhancing safety.''
   She said IBM's Federal Systems Division was selected over Hughes
Aircraft's Ground Systems Group largely because its bid was lower.
She declined to characterize how much lower the IBM bid was, except
to say the government ``benefited a great deal (on costs) from the
strong competition.''
   ``Both bids were extremely competent technically,'' she told a
news conference.
   Gerald W. Ebker, an IBM vice president and head of its Systems
Integration Division, said the contract ``is the largest contract
that IBM has ever received'' either from the government or private
industry.
   About 50 percent of the $3.6 billion project will be
subcontracted to other companies, although a list of subcontractors
has yet to be developed, said William D. Carson, the project
manager.
   Two of the biggest subcontractors will be Raytheon Co. of
Lexington, Mass., which will design and manufacture the consoles
and display equipment, and Computer Sciences Corp. of Falls Church,
Va., which will develop the software.
   First word of the contract being awarded to IBM came in a
one-sentence announcement late Monday, although at the time DOT
officials refused to elaborate or provide additional details.
   The Advanced Automation System is the cornerstone of the
government's broad-ranging air traffic control modernization

   Aviation experts have long complained that the FAA's current

installation of an interim computer system, also produced by IBM
under a separate $197 million contract, which is to serve as a
bridge until the more advanced system is available.

   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on
Tuesday refused to permit the federal government to give drug tests
to federal prison employees while a lawsuit over the practice is
pending.
   Justice O'Connor denied without comment an emergency government
request for a stay of a lower court injunction against testing
during the lawsuit.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on July 1
had refused to disturb the lower court injunction. It was that
appelate action the Bureau of Prisons sought to set aside through
the petition to Justice O'Connor, who handles emergency matters
from that circuit covering western states.
   The American Federation of Government Employees is suing to
overturn the bureau's plan to require random testing of 5 percent
to 10 percent of some 13,000 prison employees each year. The union
contends that random testing, without individual suspicion of
illegal drug use, violates, among other things, the constitutional
prohibition against illegal searches.
   The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments this fall on the
Reagan administration's drug-testing program in other government
agencies.

<HEAD>Report: Cage Around Bus' Fuel Tank Wouldn't Have Helped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crash and fire that killed 27 people
on a church bus probably would not have been prevented by a
protective cage around the vehicle's fuel tank, a state fire
marshal reported Tuesday.
   After examining fuel-tank cages on other buses, investigators
concluded ``the protective cage is to prevent the tank from being
torn away during collision and not to protect it against
puncture,'' the report said.
   The report confirmed that the fire which engulfed the bus owned
by Radcliff First Assembly of God church was caused by gasoline
gushing from a puncture, 2{ to 3 inches long, in the fuel tank.
   The bus, carrying 67 people home from an outing at an Ohio
amusement park, and a pickup truck going the wrong way collided
near Carrollton on Interstate 71 on May 14.
   The truck driver, Larry Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, was driving
while drunk, authorities said. He was indicted Friday on 27 counts
of murder _ one for each victim of the crash _ and pleaded innocent.
   The puncture probably was caused by one of the bus' front leaf
springs and the fuel tank was pushed 24 to 26 inches to the rear of
its normal position, the report said.
   ``Given the location of the puncture with respect to where the
cage would have been, it is doubtful ... that a protective cage
would have prevented the puncture of this particular tank in this
particular incident,'' the report said.
   The report said investigators could not pinpoint the source of
ignition. But investigators confirmed that the bus' front door was
knocked from its mounts, blocking escape.
   The 1977 Superior bus, bought by the church from a school
system, was among the last models manufactured before fuel-tank
cages became a federal requirement on school buses.
   The fire marshal's report recommended escape-exit windows and
roof hatches in new and old buses. The state has ordered
``pop-out'' emergency windows on new buses and recommended them for
old ones, but decided against action on roof hatches.
   The report's other recommendations included relocating fuel
tanks away from the side door of a bus; requiring emergency escape
training for passengers who ride buses on daily or weekly
schedules; restricting use of flammable materials in seats; and
improved driver training.
   Meanwhile, residents of Carroll County, where the accident
occurred, on Monday turned over a petition to the county clerk,
calling for a referendum Oct. 4 on banning liquor sales.
   A group called Concerned Citizens for Better Life gathered 1,076
signatures, more than twice the 509 needed for the alcohol sales
referendum. By Tuesday, Judge-Executive Robert Westrick had not
verified the signatures.
   A 1985 vote that let Carrollton businesses sell liquor by the
drink was decided by just 13 votes.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci departs
Thursday on a Soviet trip expected to include unprecedented visits
to air, ground and naval bases, although a senior U.S. official
expressed chagrin Tuesday that Moscow had not set the exact
schedule.
   During four days in the Soviet Union, Carlucci will meet his
Soviet counterpart, Gen. Dmitri Yazov, to continue discussions on
reducing military tension between the superpowers.
   But Carlucci will not be drawn into discussions of conventional
and nuclear arms control issues that U.S. officials say should be
conducted in established and ongoing negotiations involving
diplomats from the United States and its allies in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``The Soviet Union frequently tries to engage various parties in
government and out of government as surrogate negotiators in the
arms control area,'' a senior U.S. official said.
   ``We are not there to negotiate arms control agreements ... or
to play these kind of games,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition he not be further identified.
   Despite the tough talk, Pentagon officials were looking forward
to a visit they hoped would provide their first close look at
Soviet bases since World War II.
   ``We find it useful to have greater access to the Soviet Union,
not only to tell our story, but to see for ourselves firsthand the
types of leadership they have and their approach to military
issues,'' the official said.
   Carlucci, accompanied by Assistant Defense Secretary Ron Lehman,
representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and State Department,
and a planeload of other officials, was to depart Andrews Air Force
Base on Thursday for Helsinki, Finland. There they will meet with
Finnish President Mauno Koivisto and other officials before
arriving in Moscow on Monday for the talks.
   After departing the Soviet Union next Thursday, Carlucci will
fly to Turkey for meetings with Turkish President Kenan Evren,
Prime Minister Turgut Ozal and senior defense officials.
   He was to visit Ankara, Istanbul and a NATO base at Izmir before
returning to Washington on Aug. 8.
   In Moscow, Carlucci was expected to visit the Frunze General
Staff Military Academy, the Kubinka Air Base about 30 miles west of
the Soviet capital and the base of the Tuman division, part of the
Soviet ground forces. He is expected to fly to Sevastopol on the
Crimean Peninsula on Wednesday to look at elements of the Black Sea
fleet.
   At the beginning of July, Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal Sergei
Akhromeyev took a tour of U.S. facilities that included a close
view of flight operations on the aircraft carrier USS Theodore
Roosevelt and a look inside a B-1 bomber and a Minuteman missile
training facility.
   In return, U.S. officials let it be known that they wanted to
see a Soviet Blackjack bomber and visit Soviet ships at sea.
   ``We understand that ... (Carlucci) will go out on the Black
Sea. But we have not heard the details as to whether that will be
on a combat vessel or on a ferry boat,'' the official said.
   U.S. officials said they did not know whether the Soviets would
allow reporters and photographers to accompany Carlucci during his
visit. Such coverage was permitted for parts of Akhromeyev's trip.
   A senior Pentagon official who discussed the trip with reporters
complained that the Soviets had not given Carlucci an exact
itinerary.
   ``Generally, when we are going there, the details of the
schedule are often left until the last few minutes,'' the official
said.
   ``While we went out of our way to make sure that everything we
showed Akhromeyev was unclassified ... he saw real equipment and
real troops. ... He saw the real world. What we are looking for is
the real world, not a rigid display or a Potemkin village,'' the
official said.
   Carlucci will ask Yazov more about the Soviets' highly
publicized doctrine of ``defensive sufficiency,'' which the Kremlin
says precludes the offensive use of military forces.
   ``When Marshal Akhromeyev came here last time, he indicated he
would answer all of our questions. Let me say, it is not clear that
he answered any of our questions,'' said the official. ``So far, we
have seen no changes in Soviet force posture, production or
military spending.''
   Carlucci also will press the Soviets to move ahead on an
agreement announced on July 11 between Akhromeyev and the chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe, to set up a
working group to discuss ways of avoiding dangerous military
situations.
   And he will try to nail down specifics of an agreement announced
by Akhromeyev and Crowe for the exchange of visits by warships,
professors at military academies and senior staff and field
commanders.

   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on Tuesday
accused Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of possibly missing a chance
to end the Palestinian uprising by not accepting the U.S. plan to
resolve the dispute.
   Legislators who spoke on condition of anonymity reported on the
shouting match in a closed-door meeting of the Defense and Foreign
Affairs Committee, which signaled the start of Israel's election
campaign.
   Also Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the
governing Likud bloc to intervene in a pre-elections squabble,
paving the way for holding national and municipal elections on
separate dates, which Peres' left-of-center Labor party favors.
   Likud has asked the high court to intervene in Monday's
legislative decision to oust a Likud committee chairman who blocked
a bill separating national and local elections.
   The decision means the bill will probably pass, a defeat for
Likud, which had hoped to ride on the coattails of strong local
councils and win more votes to the parliament.
   Peres said Shamir's rightist Likud party inspired the
Palestinian uprising by rejecting Secretary of State George P.
Shultz's peace initiatives, which include an international Middle
East conference.
   Aides to Peres said he intends to make the peace negotiations a
central element in his campaign for the premiership in the November
elections.
   Peres' right-wing adversaries, led by Shamir, have also vowed to
make peace in the occupied territories central to the campaign, and
to attack Labor Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin for his failure to
quell the nearly 7-month-old Arab uprising, in which 233
Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed.
   Labor supports a retreat from the occupied territories in return
for peace, while Likud opposes any concessions to the Arabs. The
two parties have shared governmental powers after a 1984 coalition
agreement was forged to break an election stalemate.
   Peres opened the two-hour foreign policy briefing by lashing out
at Shamir, who implied that Labor sided with Egypt in a 1986
Israeli government decision to submit a border dispute to
international arbitration.
   Recent Israeli news reports said the arbitors may restore to
Egypt the strip of desert beach called Taba, which Israel seized
when it occupied Sinai in the 1967 Middle East War.
   ``This is the first time in my life that someone who also voted
for the arbitration tries to absolve himself of responsibility,''
Peres was quoted by Labor legislators as saying.
   Peres accused Shamir of ``missing a chance for peace'' by
failing to accept Shultz's plan.
   ``If it weren't for the sabotage of the peace process, of the
Shultz initiative, by half the government, then maybe we wouldn't
be in the middle of the intefadeh,'' Peres reportedly said, using
the Arabic word for ``uprising.''
   Likud legislator Eliahu Ben-Elissar interrupted Peres, shouting,
``You're not coming here with clean hands!''
   He called Peres a ``bolshevik,'' referring to the Labor Party's
left-leaning ideology.
   Peres responded by shouting at Ben-Elissar, ``You're always
slandering! You act like a fascist!'' according to Labor legislator
Micha Harish.
   Harish said the debate reflected the significance of the peace
issue in the election campaign. ``It will be without a doubt the
central issue,' he said.
   Pollsters predict a tight race between Labor and Likud, with the
latter holding a slight edge largely due to support for Israeli
hawkishness in response to the Palestinian uprising.

   Major collective bargaining settlements in
private industry during the first six months of this year provided
for wage increases averaging 2.2 percent a year, the Labor
Department reported Tuesday.
   The department said this was a slight decline from the 2.9
percent average wage increases in the contracts the last time they
were negotiated, generally two to three years ago. The contracts in
the first six months of the year covered 1.02 million workers.
   While the report on collective bargaining agreements indicated
no rise in inflationary pressures, another report covering both
union and non-union employees did show a pickup in labor costs.
   The department said that overall wages and fringe benefits rose
4.6 percent for the 12 months ending in June, compared to a smaller
3.3 percent increase a year ago.
   This report, in addition to covering union and non-union
employees, also measures total labor costs, including salaries and
such fringe benefits as health insurance and pension plans.
   The report said much of the acceleration in labor costs came
from rising health insurance premiums.
   Economists have been watching closely for accelerating wage
demands at this advanced stage of the recovery from the 1981-82
recession. Many economists believe that as long as wage demands
remain moderate, inflation will not be a threat and the Federal
Reserve will be able to keep credit conditions loose enough to keep
the recovery alive.
   John Hagens, senior economist at the WEFA Group, a private
economic forecasting firm, said that the slowdown in wage increases
in collective bargaining agreements provided solid evidence that
wage pressures are not beginning to build.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., called the rise
in collective bargaining agreements a ``very modest increase'' but
he said the pickup in overall labor costs as reflected in the
government's employment cost index was more worrisome.
   ``I think we are already seeing wage pressures in some
industries, such as services,'' he said. ``Next year, with
unemployment rates in the current low range, we will see even more
pressure on wages.''

<HEAD>Agriculture Department to Hold Referendum on Pork Research Program</HEAD>

   A referendum will be held among hog producers
and importers to determine whether a national pork promotion and
research program will continue, the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.
   The vote will be held Sept. 7-8 at county extension offices,
said J. Patrick Boyle, administrator of the department's
Agricultural Marketing Service.
   ``All pork producers or persons importing hogs, pork or pork
products between Nov. 1, 1986, and Sept. 6, 1988, will be entitled
to vote in the referendum,'' Boyle said. ``A simple majority (one
vote more than half the number cast) will determine if the ...
program will continue.''
   The 1985 farm law authorized the pork program, which is paid for
by an assessment of one quarter of 1 percent of the market value of
all hogs sold in the United States, and an equivalent amount on
imported hogs, pork and pork products.
   A final regulation setting up the program was issued by USDA on
Sept. 5, 1986, and the assessments began that fall on Nov. 1.
Congress stipulated that for the program to continue in effect a
referendum must be held between 24 months and 30 months after the
department issued the final regulation.

   President Reagan said Tuesday his pro-growth
administration also has been ``staunchly pro-environment'' and the
message being sent to polluters is, ``You're out of luck.''
   In a White House ceremony honoring 94 volunteer efforts to
preserve the nation's natural treasures, Reagan recited a litany of
successes by his administration in protecting scenic rivers,
endangered species of animals and fragile habitats.
   He said the administration has cracked down on polluters with
record numbers of criminal convictions. He praised the
Environmental Protection Agency's handling of toxic waste disposal,
likening federal regulators to actor Clint Eastwood's tough-guy
movie cop, Dirty Harry.
   ``The message to polluters is crystal clear. We told them in the
words of Dirty Harry: `You're out of luck.' Cleaner air, cleaner
water, increased protection for American wildlife _ this pro-growth
administration has also been staunchly pro-environment,'' Reagan
told the ``Take Pride in America'' awards ceremony. Eastwood is a
spokesman for the program.
   ``The same spirit of creativity and innovation that's created 17
million jobs has also benefited the land itself, making America the
beautiful more beautiful,'' Reagan said.
   But a spokesman for the Sierra Club attacked Reagan's claims and
said the administration's record on the environment is absymal and
ranks as ``the worst ever in history.''
   ``There's no question Reagan and his appointees have cooperated
to cut back virtually every environmental program we have and have
ignored facts on some of our new problems,'' said David Gardiner,
legislative director of the Sierra Club.
   Gardiner said Reagan's speech was an attempt to boost Vice
President George Bush's bid for the presidency because the
environment has ``clearly become a campaign issue.''
   Reagan praised the ``Take Pride in America'' winners for their
stewardship of the nation's ``crown jewels.''
   ``You helped clean litter out of the Grand Canyon, have given
medical care to Alaskan wildlife, planted gardens in Philadelphia
and helped preserve the wetlands of California and much, much
more,'' he said.
   More than 540 groups and individuals were nominated for the
second-annual awards. The program is a public-private partnership
involving 44 states, two U.S. territories, nine federal agencies
and dozens of private organizations.
   Flanked by Interior and Agriculture Secretaries Donald Hodel and
Richard Lyng, Reagan used the occasion to say his administration
has ``set the highest standards of enforcing the environmental
protection laws'' and pointed to 852 civil enforcement actions
filed in his first term, nearly 2{ times the rate of the Carter
administration.
   ``But we didn't stop there. We took it one step further and
established the environmental crimes unit because in the past
virtually no environmental cases were criminally prosecuted. We've
obtained over 400 criminal indictments and over 300 convictions and
guilty pleas,'' he said.
   Among his administration's other accomplishments are a $1
billion restoration program to improve and protect national parks,
the addition of millions of acres to the national wilderness
preservation system and the creation of 34 new national wildlife
refuges totaling more than 400,000 acres in 20 states.
   The number of rivers protected as wild and scenic has tripled
since 1981, he said, and the administration has made 271 additions
to the endangered and threatened species list.
   Emissions of ``manmade pollutants into the air have been
significantly reduced,'' Reagan said.
   The EPA has used the ``Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program
to complete work at more than 1,000 emergency hazardous waste sites
and work currently is under way at 700 sites on the national
priority list for toxic cleanup, Reagan said.
   ``We've kept America's commitment to land and wildlife
management, clean air, clean water and a healthier environment for
us all,'' Reagan said.

   Peace activist Philip Berrigan was sentenced
to six months in jail Tuesday for trespassing on a Navy warship.
   ``You have eight prior felony convictions and at least nine
misdemeanor convictions ... because of that you have forfeited the
right to vote or be a candidate, to do things where you can make a
difference,'' federal Magistrate Tommy Miller said in setting the
maximum sentence.
   Miller ordered the courtroom cleared for the sentencing after
about three dozen Berrigan supporters began reading a statement in
unison.
   Berrigan, along with Gregory Boertje, 32, Andrew Lawrence, 27,
and Sister Margaret McKenna, 57, admitted boarding the battleship
Iowa during an open house at the Norfolk Naval Base, slipping away
from escorts and attacking two of the ship's cruise missile
launchers with hammers, boltcutters and vials of blood. They did
only minor damage to the armored launchers.
   The four claimed their action was the ``symbolic disarming'' of
nuclear weapons that they said were illegal under international law.
   Miller found all four guilty of misdemeanor trespassing in May.
   At Tuesday's sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey M.
Wasileski said the sincerity of the four did not excuse their
actions.
   ``Mr. Berrigan's record shows 20 years of offenses in the name
of his cause,'' Wasileski said. ``It saddens the government that he
should so thoroughly reject the democratic process.''
   Berrigan offered no evidence or argument during the sentencing.
   Previously, Sister McKenna was placed on two years probation on
the condition she not enter a military establishment. Lawrence
received a 4-month jail sentence and Boertje six months.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon will release an unclassified
report on the downing of Iran Air flight 655 as soon as possible,
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Tuesday, but he declined to set
a date.
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, who is supervising the
investigation, will prepare classified and unclassified versions of
the report on why the USS Vincennes shot down an Iran Air A300
Airbus with 290 people aboard on July 3. U.S. officials said the
ship mistook the airliner for an attacking F-14 fighter.
   ``The investigating group is working on a concurrent
unclassified version of the report in addition to the normal
classified report,'' Howard said.
   The report will go first to Fogarty's immediate superior, the
commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen. George B. Crist,
then to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and finally to Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci before it is released. Each layer in the command
structure usually takes a week to review such a report, Howard said.
   ``I don't have a timetable for release,'' said Howard. Fogarty,
originally asked to complete his investigation by July 15, was
granted an extension through the end of July.
   Howard said the Pentagon was trying to avoid the delay
experienced release of a report on an attack by an Iraqi fighter
against the USS Stark on May 17, 1987.
   ``In the case of the Stark investigation, it was five months
before the report was actually released. We'd like to do a better
job of getting it to you earlier,'' said Howard.
   The spokesman said it was ``unlikely'' that the report would be
released before Carlucci returns Aug. 8 from a trip to the Soviet
Union and Turkey.

despite President Reagan's warning not to create ``windfalls for
some'' or bust the budget.
   ``It is the duty of this committee to assure that there is an
adequate supply of milk,'' said Rep. James Jeffords, R-Vt., as the
panel adopted the provision to raise the price support for each 100
pounds of milk by 50 cents.
   The committee approved the dairy plan 15-12 and then sent the
entire $6 billion relief bill to the House floor, where
consideration is expected this week.
   The bill already contained a provision to cancel a 50-cent cut
in the dairy price support scheduled for Jan. 1. The further
benefit for the politically influential dairy industry would
actually raise the price support.
   The move brought warnings that the bill could be headed for
trouble.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said that provision ``does tend to
treat one segment of agriculture more favorably than other segments
of agriculture.''
   ``This amendment makes the whole bill more vulnerable when we go
to the floor,'' Glickman said.
   There also was speculation that the dairy increase, which would
cost the government $145 million over two years by committee
estimate, might trigger a presidential veto of the legislation.
   No similar provision is contained in the Senate's drought relief
bill, which also is expected to come to the floor this week. Farm
lawmakers from the two houses are planning to meet in a conference
committee next week to fashion a final version of the legislation.
   The House panel acted despite a specific warning from President
Reagan not to provide windfalls to special interests or run to
excess with spending proposals.
   ``To put it very simply, we must not bust the budget,'' Reagan
said in a letter to House Agriculture Committee Chairman E.
``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas. He also said that ``creating
windfalls for some will mean less for the truly deserving.''
   He urged de la Garza to avoid penalizing farmers who purchase
federal crop insurance by providing equal benefits to those without
it. And he called on the chairman not to ``force farmers to do
unreasonable things.''
   ``No program should, for example, include any incentive for a
farmer to plow under his crops,'' Reagan said.
   Jeffords, whose home state is a major source of the East Coast's
milk supply, warned that dairy herds would dwindle without the
increase in the support level and cause a milk shortage that would
be hard to rectify.
   ``Cows don't drop from the sky,'' he said. He said the shortage
would raise prices and ``then you're going to hear screams from
consumers that you just won't believe.''
   Proponents shrugged off studies by the Agriculture Department
and a private group of agricultural economists holding that no milk
shortage was in the offing under the program as it stands.
   At the outset of the committee's session, Deputy Agriculture
Secretary Peter Myers told lawmakers that the administration
already disapproved of provisions of the bill that would expand
government feed benefits for livestock and dairy producers.
   He also said the administration was opposed to a provision that
would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance in the next two
years in order to be eligible for disaster payments now.
   The measure would provide disaster payments for growers of all
crops whether or not they are covered by federal farm programs
equal to 65 percent of crop losses in excess of 35 percent of
expected yield.
   There would be additional payments for farmers who suffered an
almost total wipeout of their crops. The Senate Agriculture
Committee was still struggling to add a similar provision to its
version, although the panel already has given final approval to its
bill.
   Benefits for livestock producers, primarily from expanded and
streamlined federal feed assistance programs, would be capped at
$50,000 for each individual. Payments to crop producers would be
limited to $100,000 per person.
   Crop producers would not be required to repay so-called
deficiency payments, or federal income supports, that they already
have received in advance.
   Before approving the measure, the House committee also showed
compassion for Texas cotton growers in the district of Rep. Larry
Combest, R-Texas, whose crops were damaged in 1987 by hail. The
panel approved a $24 million amendment that also would supply
disaster payments to those growers.
   Proponents acknowledged that the damage had nothing to do with
the drought but noted that there was a similar disaster relief bill
in 1986 but not in 1987. They said the Combest plan would ``fill in
the gaps.''

   Friends and relatives on Tuesday eulogized
Carter Cooper, the Vanderbilt heir who committed suicide by leaping
from his mother's 14th-floor apartment despite her entreaties.
   First lady Nancy Reagan was among the dignitaries and
celebrities at the funeral at St. James Episcopal Church on
Manhattan's Upper East Side. The sky darkened and rain fell as the
service began. Cooper died Friday at age 23.
   The ceremony was closed, leaving reporters and onlookers outside
under umbrellas and awnings. Inside, one of Cooper's brothers and
three friends eulogized him during the 75-minute service, attendees
said.
   Mrs. Reagan and Gloria Vanderbilt, who is Cooper's mother,
embraced after the funeral in Mrs. Reagan's limousine. The women
are longtime friends.
   Cooper, who had been under treatment for depression, jumped to
his death from a window in Ms. Vanderbilt's Upper East Side
apartment Friday, police said. Son of the late Wyatt Cooper, he was
graduated last year from Princeton University and worked as a
magazine writer and editor.
   He was the third of Ms. Vanderbilt's four sons.
   Ms. Vanderbilt, known for the blue jeans that bear her name, is
the great-great granddaughter of railroad and shipping magnate
Cornelius Vanderbilt. She was dubbed ``the poor little rich girl''
after she became the focus of a heated custody battle in the 1930s.

   Walter H. Bunzl, Austria's honorary consul
general in Atlanta since 1967, has died of a heart attack at age 75.
   Bunzl, born in Austria, came to Atlanta in 1939 after Germany
occupied his homeland. He operated a travel agency here from 1967
until 1986. His territory as consul general covered six Southern
states.
   He succeeded his father, the late Robert Bunzl, in the post,
which is unpaid.
   He died Thursday at Northside Hospital as he was getting dressed
after a routine medical examination. Family members said he had no
history of heart trouble.
   Bunzl was treasurer of the Atlanta Consular Corps and was active
in symphonic and other cultural activities.
   Survivors include his wife, Frances Hamburger Bunzl, two
children and a brother.

<TEXT>
   Old Faithful Geyser,
shooting water hotter than 200 degrees as high as 184 feet in the
air, is Yellowstone National Park's most popular tourist attraction
and often is considered the symbol of the country's national park
system.
   The geyser is about 10 miles east of the 5,500-acre ``North
Fork'' fire, and firefighters are trying to help wind turn the
blaze from the area.
   While the geyser, one of more than 200 in Yellowstone, is not
the most powerful in the park, it is the best-known, attracting 78
percent of the park's visitors as it erupts 21 to 23 times a day at
intervals from 33 minutes to more than two hours.
   The geyser was discovered by an exploring party in 1870, two
years before the park was established by Congress.
   A geyser is a hot spring from which water and steam are ejected
periodically. The eruptions are caused by the contact between
ground water and rock that is hot enough to create steam.
   The Old Faithful Inn, built in 1904, was the first building in
the area, which now has three lodges, including one for use during
the winter.
   The inn, placed on the U.S. Department of the Interior's list of
national historic landmarks in 1987, was expanded in 1913 and 1927
to provide 324 rooms.
   Other accommodations at the site include the Old Faithful Lodge
cabins, providing 132 rooms, and the Old Faithful Snow Lodge, which
remains open in winter, with 65 rooms.
   Old Faithful is the one of two areas of the park open for winter
users who reach the area on cross-country skis or by snowmobile.
Mammoth Hot Springs is also open in winter.
   Other services at Old Faithful include a general store and two
service stations, one of which remains open in the winter. There
are no campgrounds in the area.

<HEAD>House Ethics Panel Names Democratic Activist To Head Wright Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee named attorney
Richard J. Phelan to conduct an ethics investigation against House
Speaker Jim Wright, and Phelan, a prominent Chicago Democrat,
promised ``an independent, full review'' of allegations that Wright
abused his office for personal gain.
   Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., said Democratic
and Republican members of the evenly divided 12-member panel had
agreed on the selection of Phelan, and were satisified that he
could do an impartial job even though he has been active in
Democratic campaigns and fund raising.
   The committee is satisfied, ``notwithstanding the fact that he
has exercised his right (to political activity), based on his
ability and his reputation, that he can in this case be fair and
impartial,'' Dixon said.
   Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind., the panel's senior Republican,
concurred.
   Dixon said the committee had decided to hire outside counsel
when it formally opened its six-count investigation of Wright,
D-Texas, on June 9, but had withheld announcement of the decision
until someone was chosen for the job.
   The contract with Phelan's firm, Phelan, Pope & John, will be
for no more than $300,000, he said. Dixon said he could not
estimate how long the investigation will take to complete.
   ``As I see our job, it's to conduct an independent, full review
of all the facts that have been presented in the inquiry and report
back to the committee,'' Phelan told reporters in a brief
appearance outside the closed committee room.
   ``The fact that I'm a Democrat doesn't stand in my way of being
fair and full,'' he added. ``I would hope that no citizen would be
branded unfair or unobjective simply because he exercised his basic
American right.'' He said his selection was ``a great opportunity
for me, and I appreciate the confidence the committee had. I'm
going to do my very, very best.''
   But Dixon, in response to a question, said Phelan would not be
authorized to go beyond the scope of the six-count resolution of
inquiry unanimously adopted by the panel on June 9.
   That drew a complaint from Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., Wright's
chief accuser, who said no inquiry could be considered independent
if it does not permit investigators to follow leads to their
conclusions.
   ``The independent counsel has to be truly independent,''
Gingrich said. ``He cannot be on a short leash held by the
Democratic chairman of the committee.''
   Gingrich objected to the choice of Phelan, whom he called a
partisan Democrat. The Chicago lawyer has been a fund-raiser for
the presidential campaign of Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois, according to an article in the January issue of the
American Lawyer.
   Phelan's selection also was criticized by Citizens for Reagan,
which sent a Mailgram to the committee saying, ``The appointment of
liberal Democrat activist Richard Phelan as outside counsel in the
Wright case certainly calls into question the independence of the
ethics committee inquiry.''
   Wright complained that Gingrich appears to be trying to set
impossible standards for the investigation so he can criticize it _
no matter what the outcome _ as a whitewash.
   ``Failing to have any substance on which to rely, they are
trying to lay the impression that the inevitable result of a clear
bill of health is somehow a whitewash,'' Wright said. ``They would
have said that no matter whom they chose'' as outside counsel, he
added.
   Wright is under formal investigation on charges of using his
office to lobby federal officials and others on matters in which he
had a financial interest, and for alleged improprieties in the
publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which Wright
received unusually high royalties, among other charges.
   Just a few hours before the announcment, the lobbying group
Common Cause asked the committee to demonstrate publicly that any
outside counsel will have authority and independence.
   The request, in a letter from Common Cause Chairman Archibald
Cox to Dixon, said that could be done by giving the investigator
full authority to investigate, review documents, issue subpoenas
and present evidence to the panel; to hire whatever staff is needed
to conduct the inquiry; and to recommend formal charges be brought
before the committee if warranted.
   The panel also should guarantee that the outside counsel ``shall
be free, after discussion with the committee, to make such public
statements and reports as the counsel deems appropriate,'' Cox said.
   Dixon declined to respond publicly to the Common Cause letter.
He said the panel had been considering Phelan as outside counsel
for several weeks and said the Chicago attorney had been
interviewed individually by all Republican and Democratic members
of the committee.
   Wright said he does not know Phelan, but added, ``apparently,
he's a reputable attorney.''

   Top aides to Michael Dukakis said Tuesday they
expected Jesse Jackson to take a short vacation before campaigning
for the Democratic presidential nominee but that some Jackson aides
could join the Dukakis effort within days.
   ``We're talking about people at every level and things look real
good,'' said Donna Brazile, Dukakis' deputy national field
director. ``A lot of progress has been made since the convention.''
   Top Jackson aides were huddling Tuesday in Chicago to discuss
their future and Brazile said the Dukakis campaign expected to
receive a list of names of Jackson workers interested in working on
the fall campaign.
   ``We'll be talking to them in the next 24 hours and hopefully
we'll have something to announce within 72 hours or so,'' Brazile
said in a telephone interview.
   The Dukakis campaign has several state director posts vacant and
has said it will recruit Jackson organizers for some of them.
Brazile and Charlie Baker, the Dukakis campaign's national field
director, met with several Jackson field staffers Friday in Atlanta
before returning home from the Democratic National Convention.
   As for Jackson himself, Dukakis aides said no definite campaign
schedule has been worked out as yet.
   Joseph Warren, the Dukakis campaign secretary who has assumed
the added title of general election campaign coordinator, said it
was his understanding that Jackson wanted to take a brief vacation.
   ``We're anxious for him to get going but that hasn't been worked
out yet,'' said Warren, a college classmate of Jackson and the
ranking black in the Dukakis campaign.
   When Jackson does travel, Warren said he expected the money to
come from the Democratic Party because the trips will be focusing
on voter registration and related efforts more than direct
campaigning for Dukakis.
   ``But that has not been totally settled yet, either,'' Warren
said. ``We know that that we're going to find the money to get him
around.''
   Brazile said she has asked Jackson aides interested in joining
the Dukakis camp to express their interest soon so that the
campaign can draft its fall campaign payroll by early August.
   In addition, she said Dukakis and aides would use the next few
campaign trips to reach out to volunteers and elected officials who
supported Jackson during the primaries. Meetings are planned in
Cleveland and Milwaukee during the Dukakis campaign swing this
weekend, she said.
   Brazile, who worked for Jackson in 1984, said Dukakis has moved
to include Jackson supporters much faster than 1984 nominee Walter
Mondale.
   ``It took a long time for the Mondale people to get us on board,
late August,'' she said. ``We're in a much better position.''

   A married woman missing for nearly two
months may have been killed and buried in a desolate grave beneath
a crude cross, the victim of her lover's suicidal obsession with
voodoo, police said Tuesday.
   Caroline M. Rubia's disappearance June 2 and the discovery of a
makeshift altar and mystical paraphernalia in her boyfriend's
closet have led detectives on a search through the strange
subculture of the primitive religion.
   Police theorize that Rubia, 52, was killed by her lover of 20
years, a roofing contractor who changed his name in 1979 from
Charles William Turner to Che Francois Toussaint.
   Toussaint, 47, was found dead in his bed of cyanide poisoning
when investigators broke into his barricaded home June 7 expecting
to find Rubia's body.
   Investigators found a crude altar and other items in his closet,
including three snapshots of Rubia covered with salt and three
one-quart Mason jars turned upside down with a strip of tape
labeled ``Me'' on one, a second labeled ``Carol Rubia'' with ``Stop
it!'' written underneath and a third reading ``Carol and I.''
   The jars were covered with salt and contained spices, peppers
and molasses. A recipe found in Toussaint's garbage can mixed
tartar powder, crushed red pepper and crosses.
   Investigators went to a Berkeley religion expert with the items.
They also presented the expert with desperate letters Toussaint
mailed before his suicide blaming Rubia and her ``witchcraft'' for
his bad health and business failures.
   The expert theorized Toussaint buried Rubia in a way that would
prevent her spirit from escaping. He said the grave likely would be
covered with salt and pins and that the victim's hands probably
would be tied.
   ``Salt and pins were to keep her spirit confined, even in death,
and that's why the expert was sure she was tied, too,'' said Young.
   Authorities are hoping the expert will help them find Rubia's
body.
   Her bloody prescription glasses were found in Toussaint's pickup
truck after he committed suicide.
   The Berkeley expert, a self-described ``good witch'' who police
did not name, told officers the items are those used in voodoo, an
African-born religion based on a belief in sorcery.
   The jars, molasses and spices were supposed to seal in bad
spirits and prevent them from attacking Toussaint, the expert said.
   ``He wanted a barrier between him and her in both worlds,''
Young said. Toussaint's ex-wife said Toussaint was fearful of
spirits when married to her and would cover her doll collection to
smother its power.
   Toussaint told friends Rubia was slowly poisoning him, said
Detective Sharon Young, of the San Jose Police Department's
missing-persons unit.
   Rubia attended a Catholic retreat shortly before her
disappearance at which she decided to leave her lover and devote
herself to her husband and family, Young said.

   Thousands of mourners chanted prayers
Tuesday as the bodies of the head priest of the Golden Temple and
another Sikh leader were cremated the day after they were slain by
extremists.
   The bodies of Sohan Singh, head priest of Sikhism's holiest
shrine in Amritsar, and Bhan Singh, a scholar and secretary of the
Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, which manages the temple,
were borne in separate processions from their homes to the Golden
Temple.
   They were then laid out at nearby cremation grounds, where Sikh
rites and prayers chanted by 3,000 mourners accompanied the burning
of the bodies on funeral pyres.
   ``This is an attack on all Sikhs because the post of head priest
carries special status and honor among us,'' said former Sikh chief
priest Kirpal Singh, who performed the last rites.
   Sikh gunmen opened fire Monday on Sohan Singh, Bhan Singh and
Mal Singh Ghuman, another temple official, as they emerged from a
meeting at a college in Ludhiana, about 75 miles southeast of
Amritsar. Ghuman was seriously injured in the attack but was
reported out of danger Tuesday after surgery.
   The Khalistan Liberation Force and the Babbar Khalsa group _
both extremist groups _ claimed the killings in a handwritten note
found Tuesday outside the house of a journalist from a
Punjabi-language newspaper. The reporter asked that his name not be
used.
   Underground Sikh groups in the northern Punjab region have been
waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for an independent homeland.
   A.P. Pandey, a senior police official in Ludhiana, said the note
gave no clue to help in the statewide manhunt for the killers. He
said there had been no breakthrough in the case.
   On Tuesday, three more people, including two members of one
family, were killed in attacks blamed on Sikh extremists, United
News of India reported.
   The latest casualties raised the death toll to nearly 1,600 in
the guerrilla war this year.
   Militant Sikhs, who are a majority in Punjab but make up less
than 2 percent of India's population, charge they are discriminated
against by the majority Hindus.

<TEXT>
   Former Justice Department criminal division
chief William Weld testified on Tuesday that he resigned in protest
last March after telling his boss, Edwin Meese III, that the
attorney general had probably broken the law.
   And Meese's former top deputy, Arnold I. Burns, said he quit the
same day because of the ``deep malaise'' at the department, adding
that Meese was living in ``a world of Alice in Wonderland'' about
his problems.
   Weld told the Senate Judiciary Committee that if Meese were an
ordinary citizen, he probably would have been prosecuted for taking
gratuities from his longtime friend E. Robert Wallach.
   Weld, who resigned March 29 to protest Meese's continued tenure
in the face of a criminal investigation by independent counsel
James McKay, said that he told Meese the day hequit that the
statute barring the acceptance of gratuities in exchange for the
performance of official duties ``Certainly would reach the conduct
of Mr. Wallach and probably that of Mr. Meese.''
   Weld said he reiterated his views in April in a 40-minute
meeting with President Reagan and Vice President George Bush.
   Weld said he concluded that the attorney general had certainly
violated federal ethics guidelines prohibiting public officials
from committing acts which give any appearance of impropriety.
   Before resigning, Weld said he decided that ``if Mr. Meese were
an ordinary public official, he would be prosecuted under the
gratuity law.''
   ``When I was the United States Attorney in Boston, we
successfully prosecuted building inspectors who accepted gifts from
friends who maintained they merely wanted to `get in good,' or `say
thanks,' or `expedite' an otherwise lawful official action,'' the
former assistant attorney general told the committee. ``In short, I
came to the conclusion that this set of facts was sufficiently
serious that I felt I could not continue as chief of the criminal
division at the Justice Department.''
   Weld and Burns, the former deputy attorney general, disclosed
new details about their White House meeting with Reagan, with Burns
describing Bush as becoming ``florid, very upset.'' Burns said
Reagan appeared ``distressed'' during what Weld described as a
``very frank and candid'' discussion in which Burns, among other
things, outlined how a ``deep malaise'' had set in at the Justice
Department because Meese refused to step down.
   Weld listed for the committee 63 items of fact concerning the
attorney general's relationship with Wallach, which Weld said
bolstered his contention that Meese had violated ethics regulations
and probably had violated the gratuities statute.
   Wallach publicly proclaimed his access to Meese, and Wallach was
paid from $1.3 million to $1.4 million by the scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp.
   ``That's too much for a San Francisco tort lawyer helping out a
company in a government contracting context'' and ``raises a
question as to what he's doing for them,'' said Weld.
   Burns said Meese ignored his advice to distance himself from
Wallach.
   Burns said that he told Meese around April 8, 1987 that Wallach
``was in a lot of trouble'' and that Weld had told Meese that
``Wallach was in deep yogurt.'' Wallach currently is under
indictment for alleged racketeering in the Wedtech scandal.
   ``I advised Mr. Meese to distance himself from Mr. Wallach, told
him to sever his relationship with Mr. Wallach, told him to
repudiate Mr. Wallach. My advice was not heeded,'' said Burns.
   Burns said he was shocked around May 1, 1987 when Meese, weeks
after being told that Wallach was under criminal investigation in
the Wedtech scandal, told Burns that a job offer by Meese to
Wallach to become his counselor in the Justice Department was still
open.
   ``Mr. Wallach crept up on him; Mr. Wallach horn-swoggled him,''
Burns said when asked by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, to explain
why Meese would have continued to hold a post open for Wallach.
   Meese last week categorically denied that he had entertained any
idea of hiring Wallach at the Justice Department once he learned
that the San Francisco personal injury lawyer was under
investigation in the Wedtech scandal.
   Burns responded bitterly to Meese's suggestion Monday that Burns
and Weld had failed to carry out a competent and thorough
preliminary inquiry in the spring of 1987, thus triggering the
criminal investigation of Meese by McKay, who has decided not to
seek an indictment of the attorney general.
   Burns disclosed a letter of May 11, 1987 from Meese's lawyers in
which they ask that matters concerning Meese be referred to a
court-appointed independent counsel.
   ``According to Mr. Meese, everybody is wrong,'' said Burns.
``Mr. Meese continued to defend one E. Bob Wallach ... You can get
the flavor of what life is like in the Department of Justice ...
It's a world of Alice in Wonderland, a world of illusion and
allusion, a world in which up is down and down is up; in was out
and out was in ... Into the various situations ... there was a
common denominator; that common denominator was E. Bob Wallach.''
   ``Mr. Wallach appears to have become, over time, the financial
`Johnny on the spot' for Mr. Meese,'' Weld testified.
   Wallach was paid $150,000 by a partner in a $1 billion Iraqi oil
pipeline. Meese assisted Wedtech and the pipeline and both were
subjects of McKay's criminal investigation.
   The $150,000 was pooled with Meese's money and that of other
investors by financial manager W. Franklyn Chinn, who turned a
$40,000 profit for Meese on a $55,000 investment in just 18 months.
   In addition, Wallach provided Meese with free legal counsel and
introduced Meese to Chinn in the first place.
   ``It is well documented that Mr. Wallach enjoyed unparalleled
access to Mr. Meese, and saw him frequently throughout the time Mr.
Meese was in the White House and at the Justice Department,'' said
Weld.

   A woman accused of helping hijack an
airliner to Cuba in 1969 worked as a preschool teacher's aide for
the last five years before authorities ended her 19 years as a
fugitive.
   Neighbors and her employer said Tuesday they were surprised to
learn that the quiet, friendly woman they knew as Haziine Eytina
had been using that name and 13 other aliases to keep the FBI off
her trail.
   ``We were just as shocked as everybody when the FBI was outside
with guns pointed at everybody,'' said Betty Bellino, director of
the Masterson Day Care Center a few doors away from Eytina's
apartment in a working-class neighborhood of Albany.
   Rifle-toting FBI agents surrounded the home of 39-year-old Linda
Joyce Grinage and her husband, lawyer Mylo Eytina, and took her
into custody Monday on a charge of air piracy, which carries a
sentence of 20 years to life in prison.
   The glum-looking Grinage, who wouldn't talk to reporters while
being led away in handcuffs from brief court appearances Monday and
Tuesday, had worked for five years as a bus monitor and teacher's
aide for Head Start, a preschool for low-income youngsters, said
Robert Burns, of the organization's board of directors.
   On Jan. 2, 1969, authorities say, Grinage and her then-husband,
Tyrone Ellington Austin, took a 2-year-old boy hostage on an
Eastern Airlines flight from New York's Kennedy International
Airport to Miami, then forced the pilot at gunpoint to fly to
Havana.
   The woman, who had an infant strapped to her back, ran up the
aisle of the plane screaming, followed by Austin shouting ``Black
power, Havana'' to terrified passengers and crew, according to news
accounts of the hijacking.
   It was unclear how Grinage returned to the United States, but
authorities said they lost track of her during the 1970s. Austin
died in 1971 from gunshot wounds suffered in a bank robbery attempt
in New York City.
   An anonymous phone caller tipped off authorities a year ago that
Grinage was living in Albany, and time was taken to nail down the
case, said Barbara Cottrell, an assistant U.S. attorney.
   Eytina said the charges against his wife were ``absolute
poppycock.'' He said his wife had lived and worked in Albany for 10
years, although police said they had only traced her Albany
residence to 1983.
   ``I think people should speak highly of me and my wife because
we've worked diligently to be spoken highly of,'' Eytina said
Tuesday, after a federal hearing to establish his wife's identity
was put off for one day.
   The couple had six children, but one was killed last year in an
auto accident, said Wayne Alford, a spokesman for the FBI's Albany
office. He said he didn't know how long the couple had been married.
   Grinage, who gave Head Start officials the name of Haziine Ey
Tina, had caused no problems at work, Burns said. He said officials
checked child abuse records and references and made an ``informal''
check with local police.
   ``If we had any indication that this was a hostage-taker, we
wouldn't be sitting here today,'' Burns said. ``There's nothing
significant in her five-year history that would indicate there was
any abuse or violence toward children.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders VA in Washington State To Refund Foreclosure Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered the Veterans
Administration to refund $3 million to $6 million to veterans in
Washington state who lost their homes in foreclosures on VA-backed
loans.
   The order, received Monday by attorneys in the class-action
suit, also ordered the VA to erase at least $45 million in debt the
agency has tried to collect from more than 3,500 veterans who lost
their homes to foreclosures.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer found the VA had violated a
state law governing the amount of money that could be collected
under a section providing a ``shortcut'' for foreclosures.
   David Leen, a lawyer representing five veterans, said a similar
suit is pending in federal court in San Francisco and that more
than $200 million in uncollected debts are at stake in California.
   Several other states have laws similar to Washington's, which
could mean hundreds of millions of dollars are due veterans who
lost their homes, Leen said. Those states include Oregon, Idaho,
Alaska, Minnesota, New Mexico, Montana and Texas, said Lisa
Donaldson, a law clerk to Leen.
   The Veterans Administration ``basically wanted their cake and
they wanted to eat it too, plus a second helping,'' Leen said.
   The Washington state law established for lenders a shortcut way,
known as non-judicial foreclosure, to seize a home from a borrower
who failed to make payments on a home loan.
   In the five cases that made up the class-action suit, the VA
chose the non-judicial route to save time and legal fees, believing
it could rely on its own regulations to collect from veterans any
extra costs it incurred, such as legal fees, court filing costs and
losses on resale of the home.
   However, Dwyer said Washington state law provided that lenders
could not collect such extra money from debtors when the
foreclosure was settled non-judicially, or out of court.
   Dwyer's ruling said the law was meant to protect debtors and
that it superceded the VA's regulations.
   Henry Cohn, staff attorney for the VA in Washington, D.C., said
Tuesday the agency had not decided whether to appeal Dwyer's
ruling. Part of that decision depends on what effect an appeal
might have on other states, he said.
   Dwyer's ruling requires the VA to repay veterans money collected
in foreclosures since 1981, the effective date for the statute of
limitations. Leen sued in 1987.
   VA officials estimated they had collected, and would need to
refund, $3 million to $6 million.
   Last August, the VA said it was trying to collect more than $45
million from veterans involved in foreclosures in Washington state.
Leen said papers the VA filed in court now place that figure at $63
million.
   The VA stopped trying to collect foreclosure costs in June 1987
after Leen filed the class-action suit. The agency said the
moratorium would last until the suit was settled.
   Leen filed the class-action lawsuit after winning a similar case
for Rudy Vallejo, 31, of Seattle. Vallejo, a roofer, sued the VA
over $8,700 in foreclosure costs it sought from him after he lost
his home in 1982.
   ``This is great,'' Vallejo said. ``A lot of people are going to
get their money back.''

Policies</HEAD>

   Both presidential candidates will make natural
gas the key to their energy policies, two Texans working for the
campaigns told the gas industry Tuesday.
   Each promised a different menu of tax breaks, to be phased out
if prices rise, to help domestic oil and gas drillers.
   George Bush ``feels strongly one of the ways we can solve this
tremendous import problem is by playing the gas card,'' said Robert
Mosbacher Sr., the Bush campaign finance chairman and Houston
independent oil and gas producer.
   Michael Dukakis ``is going to be somebody who is absolutely the
strongest advocate of natural gas we have ever had in this
country,'' said John Sharp, chairman of the candidate's Texas
campaign.
   Mosbacher referred to the growing dependence on imported crude
oil and refined products, now more than 41 percent of consumption
compared with 35 percent a year ago.
   Many domestic producers have advocated a tariff on oil imports,
but neither man mentioned such a measure in brief speeches before
the Natural Gas Roundtable, a monthly luncheon sponsored by gas
trade associations.
   Despite low prices, the country is not consuming all available
natural gas. Consumption last year was 25 percent below the 1972
peak and according to industry estimates at least 10 percent to 15
percent below what could be easily delivered from existing wells.
   Bush would use natural gas for transportation, both as a vehicle
fuel in its own right and a source for methanol, Mosbacher said.
This would help air pollution problems in cities where the strategy
is followed, he said.
   His package of tax breaks, some of which would restore tax
treatment of some oil and gas practices to what it was before the
1986 income tax changes, would be ``phased out as the industry
recovers and prices rise,'' Mosbacher said.
   Mosbacher said offshore oil drilling, which Dukakis has said he
opposes in environmentally sensitive areas, and nuclear energy must
be part of the nation's energy future. Dukakis opposes further
construction of reactors until waste disposal questions are solved
and a new design is available.
   Bush would grant tax credits for exploration expenses and would
seek certain exemptions from application of the alternative minimum
tax, Mosbacher said.
   Dukakis is exploring a ``strategic natural gas reserve,'' in the
form of underground storage dispersed around the country, Sharp
said. Though many gas companies maintain storage, a national
program would help counter fears of a resumption of the shortages
of the late 1970s, he said.
   Dukakis also is considering a $5 per barrel premium for
purchases from new domestic wells for the strategic petroleum
reserve, Sharp said. In some recent years Mexico has supplied all
the oil for the reserve and domestic producers have been reluctant
to bid.

   Smokey Tennison reads the business
section every day, edits a newspaper and plans to become president
of the United States someday.
   That is, if the 11-year-old doesn't take a shine to being host
of a late-night television program after he appears on ``The
Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'' this week.
   Smokey, who prefers suits and ties to jeans and T-shirts, is on
a campaign to keep his ``Garfield News'' alive at Garfield
Elementary School.
   He and some friends put together seven issues of the newspaper
during the school year.
   But Garfield Principal Denis Clark told Smokey he couldn't
distribute the paper at school this fall because of spelling
mistakes, lack of adult supervision and the amount of time Smokey
spent on the paper.
   Right now, one of his concerns, Smokey said, is what to wear on
the nationally televised program. He said he's leaning toward
wearing a suit, but definitely will wear a tie.
   ``Why don't you just look like a normal 11-year-old?'' asked his
mother, Sue Tennison.

   Several residents of a Potomac neighborhood
say they are just as likely to hear a sermon preached on their
telephone lines as they are to hear the person on the other end of
the line.
   Carolyn Anderson is one of several residents who for the last
several years have picked up Christian broadcasts from a nearby
radio station on their telephones, home computers, home intercom
systems, and other electronic systems.
   ``I can hear it through the telephones all the time, everytime I
pick up the telephone,'' Ms. Anderson said. ``I've kept my
telephone conversations shorter because sometimes it's as loud as
the person I'm talking to.''
   The neighborhood, in the Bedfordshire section of Potomac, is
next to the Falls Road Public Golf Course, site of transmitting
towers for WCTN.
   John Vogt, executive vice president and general manager of WCTN,
said the problem is as frustrating for the station as it is for
residents.
   ``We definitely want to be a service to the community not an
annoyance,'' Vogt said.
   Ivy Pascal, a neighbor of Ms. Anderson, said once the broadcast
blared out of a bedroom telephone while it was on the hook.
   ``It was preaching hell and damnation, and I was lying on my bed
minding my own business. I had to unplug my phone,'' Ms. Pascal
said.

   Birtie and John Weaver began their union
when Teddy Roosevelt was president and have seen it through two
World Wars, the advent of airplane phones, and more than 100
great-grandchildren.
   On Monday they celebrated their 81st anniversary.
   ``We think as much of one another as we did when we were
married,'' said Weaver, 96. Mrs. Weaver is 97.
   The Weavers have been nationally recognized as the
longest-married couple in the United States by Worldwide Marriage
Encounter, a non-profit organization.
   Their marriage began in defiance when as teen-agers, they eloped
from the disapproving frowns of her parents in rural south Georgia.
They took to back roads and finally found a justice of the peace
who consented to marry the young rebels.
   Six of the Weavers' 13 children are alive _ the oldest is 75 and
the youngest 45. The couple has about 50 grandchildren, more than
100 great-grandchildren and some 25 great-great-grandchildren.
   Neither of them had visited a hospital until their ninth decade,
and now they rely on daily visits from their children for meals and
household tending.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Urge FCC Action Against Independent Operator
Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two consumer groups Tuesday asked the Federal
Communications Commission to order the five largest independent
telephone operator services out of business, claiming the companies
charge excessive rates.
   Washington-based Telecommunications Research and Action Center
and San Francisco-based Consumer Action said their survey shows
these providers' rates are as much as 3{ times higher than those of
the major long-distance companies.
   The companies, called alternative operator services or AOS
companies, provide service to guests in hotels and motels and at
pay phones, as well as at some hospitals and universities, which
receive commissions from the AOS.
   The companies handle credit card, collect and third-party billed
calls, routing ``0''-plus calls over lines leased from the major
long-distance carriers.
   David Wagenhauser, staff attorney for the center, said consumers
need to be protected from the high rates of these companies.
   ``Just because these are transient consumers doesn't mean they
should be moving targets,'' he said at a news conference outside
the FCC headquarters.
   The FCC, prompted by a surge in complaints about AOS companies
last spring, launched an investigation into the industry, which
began developing about a year and a half ago. The agency also
issued a consumer alert advising callers to ask operators what
rates they will be charged.
   The FCC does not regulate the rates AOS companies charge for
interstate long-distance calls. Several states, however, have begun
considering regulation of the industry for intrastate calls.
   The consumer groups criticized the FCC for failing to take
action against AOS providers.
   Greg Vogt, chief of the FCC's telephone enforcement unit,
defended the agency against the criticism, noting its inquiry into
the industry and its work on behalf of irate consumers seeking
credit for AOS calls.
   The FCC also has been meeting with AOS companies, Vogt said.
``I've been pleased with the response with the industry, admitting
there are problems and working out solutions.''
   The consumer groups said the FCC should revoke the operating
authority of Central Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; International
Telecharge Inc. of Dallas; National Telephone Services Inc. of
Rockville, Md.; Payline Systems Inc. of Portland, Ore.; and
Telesphere Network Inc. of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.
   A. Roger Pease, president of Payline Systems, acknowledged that
``there are some bad apples'' among AOS providers, but he said,
``this industry has a right to compete.''
   Pease said the consumer groups' petition to the FCC is
unwarranted. He said the marketplace will shake out the unethical
companies and a newly formed trade association for operator service
providers will help establish a code of ethics for the industry.

   Here is a brief summary of the 17 impeachment
articles approved by the House Judiciary Committee against U.S.
District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami.
   Article 1: ``From some time in the first half of 1981 and
continuing through Oct. 9, 1981, Judge Hastings and William
Borders, then a Washington, D.C. attorney, engaged in a corrupt
conspiracy to obtain $150,000 from defendants in United States vs.
Romano, a case tried before Judge Hastings, in return for the
imposition of sentences which would not require incarceration of
the defendants.''
   Articles 2 through 15 accused Hastings of lying at his trial on
specific aspects of the case.
   Article 16: ``As supervising judge, Judge Hastings learned
highly confidential information'' from a wiretap. ``On Sept. 6,
1985, Judge Hastings revealed'' information from the wiretap ``as
follows ... On the morning of September 6, 1985, Judge Hastings
told Stephen Clark, the mayor of Dade County, Fla., to stay away
from Kevin `Waxy' Gordon, who was `hot' and was using the mayor's
name in Hialeah, Fla.
   ``As a result of this improper disclosure, certain
investigations then being conducted by law enforcement agents of
the United States were thwarted and ultimately terminated.''
   Article 17: Through his corrupt relationship with Borders, false
testimony, fabrication of false documents submitted as trial
evidence and improper disclosure of confidential wiretap
information, Hastings did ``undermine confidence in the integrity
and impartiality of the judiciary and betray the trust of the
people ... thereby bringing disrepute on the federal courts and the
administration of justice ... .''

<TEXT>
   A minister and his community are taking a
leap of faith and opening ... a supermarket.
   The Rev. Jerry Young noticed that in recent years two chains
opened and then closed supermarkets in the shopping center down the
road from his New Hope Baptist Church in northwestern Jackson.
   It seemed to him that retailers were deserting the area as
low-income people moved in, forcing residents to leave their
neighborhood to buy groceries.
   So Young decided to try to revitalize the shopping center.
   He recruited some deacons and other church officials to form
Help Inc. and sold stock to area residents for $10 a share. Help
Ltd., a partnership formed by community leaders, bought the
shopping center land and buildings. Church officials did not
disclose the price.
   Today, the shopping center, renamed Jackson North Plaza,
includes an ice cream parlor and Family Dollar Store. A supermarket
is to open next month. It will be called Broma, a biblical word
meaning food.
   Profit was not the primary motive, said Young, but he did his
homework in hopes of making Broma a success. The pastor and some
deacons visited grocery stores around the state to get ideas on how
to run theirs.
   Young also hired a former supermarket co-manager to run the
store. About 60 other workers, mostly teen-agers, will stock
shelves and run the cash registers.
   Young admits the venture is a ``tremendous step of faith.''
   ``We're trying to address a need. The community will respond to
that,'' he said.
   But the supermarket will have to survive with a handicap: It
will not sell beer. ``It's against our doctrine,'' Young said.

   Minority-owned broadcast stations provide more
programming of interest to minorities than non-minority-owned
stations, according to a congressional report.
   The report by the Congressional Research Service also found that
stations owned by women cater to female audiences to a larger
extent than male-owned stations, though not to the degree that
minority-owned stations program to minority audiences.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce telecommunications subcommittee, requested the study for
use in a pending federal court case challenging the
constitutionality of the FCC's policy giving preference to
minorities and women in awarding broadcast licenses.
   The FCC had argued in that case, involving a new FM station at
St. Simon Island, Ga., that its preference policy may be
unconstitutional because it had no factual evidence that the
policies contributed to diversity of programming at radio and
television stations.
   However, Congress last year added a stipulation to the FCC's
budget authorization barring the agency from eliminating the
preferences.
   In releasing the study this week, Markey said, ``The commission
wanted empirical evidence, and now it has a clear record.''
   Diane Killory, FCC general counsel, said the agency was
reviewing the study and had no comment on it.
   ``The commission has to decide what position to take,'' she said.
   The study analyzed data from an FCC survey of 8,720 U.S. radio
and television stations, about 79 percent of the total.
   It cautioned about difficulty in determining to what extent a
station's programming decisions was driven by the racial, ethinic
or female make-up of its audience or resulted from
minority-ownership interests.
   However, the report concluded, ``there is a strong indication
that minority and women station-ownership results in a greater
degree of minority programming.''

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian who may be linked with a
terrorist attack aboard a Greek cruise ship appeared in court
Tuesday, but the hearing was postponed after he claimed he had not
been briefed on the case.
   After the complaint, a new hearing to check the identity of the
Palestinian, identified as 39-year-old Mohammed Rashid, was set for
Aug. 2, a judicial spokesman said.
   Rashid was sentenced July 13 to seven months for entering Greece
on a forged passport. Greece is considering a U.S. request for his
extradition on charges of planting a bomb on a Pan Am jumbo jet
that killed a Japanese teen-ager and injured 15 in Hawaii in 1982.
   Police theorize that a machine gun and grenade attack against
the City of Poros cruise ship on July 11 was a bungled attempt to
hijack the ship and force Rashid's release.
   The assault left nine people dead and more than 90 injured.
   Tuesday's hearing before an appeal court prosecutor was a
routine procedure in cases where mistaken identity is claimed, said
the judicial spokesman, who requested anonymity in keeping with
Greek practice.
   Rashid claims his real name is Mohammed Hamdan and told
reporters at the court ``the Greek police arrested the wrong man.''
   He was arrested May 29 at Athens Airport while carrying a forged
Syrian passport in the name of Mohammed Hamdan.
   He was identified when his fingerprints matched those of Rashid,
who was jailed in Greece from 1973-76 on narcotics smuggling
charges, police said.
   Rashid also is accused of bombing a TWA jetliner over Greece in
April 1986. Four people, among them a baby girl, died when the
explosion blasted them out of the plane.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
Tuesday he will ``move decisively'' and quickly against defense
contractors implicated in the ongoing bribery investigation as soon
as he receives more details from the Justice Department.
   Carlucci has already ordered a number of changes in the way the
Pentagon buys weapons and more are likely as a result of the
investigation, he told the House Armed Services Committee.
   The Justice Department probe centers on allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of whom are former Pentagon
employes, bribed Defense Department officials for inside details
about contracts. No charges have yet been filed.
   Carlucci said he had no new details about the two-year-old
investigation, which became public June 14 when subpoenas were
served around the nation.
   At one point, Carlucci ordered contacts frozen on nine military
programs because of the possibility that they may have been
tainted, but he rescinded that order 10 days later when a quick
review showed there were no problems.
   Carlucci acted after an affidavit for a search warrant was
unsealed in Dallas, providing details about the Justice Department
investigation.
   The Justice Department has sought to have the affidavits sealed,
but several news organizations have challenged that action.
   Carlucci promised to ``move decisively ... as soon as we receive
facts from the Justice investigation.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the committee, noted that
``in the next few weeks, it is expected that the United States
attorney will authorize the release of information on the
investigation now under court seal.''
   ``When that information is available, the Department of Defense
will have more specifics on contracts or source selections that may
have been influenced by improper activities,'' he noted.
   Carlucci repeated his appeals to Congress to wait until all the
facts are made public before ordering sweeping overhauls in the
complicated Pentagon purchasing procedures.
   Carlucci said he meets daily with a special task force he set up
last month to track the investigation and recommend changes.
   ``My instructions do not limit the nature of the changes,'' he
said. ``Nothing is sacred _ neither organizational structure,
regulations, nor the need to change existing law.''
   Carlucci cast cold water on one proposal which has surfaced in
Congress _ holding corporate chief executives responsible for their
firms' actions. ``I think it's really impractical,'' he said, and
would probably only result in firms declining to bid for Pentagon
contracts.
   ``Ill-conceived reforms can quickly convince many firms that
defense business does not provide a sufficient chance for a
reasonable profit to make it worthwhile or compensate for the
perennial `stops and starts' of military business,'' he said.
   He said profit-and-earning ``ratios in the industry are alrady
low. If we drive them down further, industry will lack the capital
to keep up with modernization.''
   He also warned against wide-ranging bans that attempt to close
the so-called ``revolving door'' between government and private
employment, such as working for the Pentagon and then going to work
for a defense contractor.
   ``The problems we face in attracting into government service
talented individuals from the private sector would be exacerbated
by the imposition of a broad post-government employment bar,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Leads Bush By 17 Points in Latest Gallup Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, riding a wave of
positive publicity from the convention that nominated him for
president last week, led Vice President George Bush by 17 points in
a Gallup poll released Tuesday.
   Dukakis drew 54 percent support to 37 percent for Bush in the
survey, conducted among 1,001 registered voters Friday through
Sunday, radio station WEEI in Boston, one of the poll's sponsors,
reported.
   A Gallup poll for Newsweek on Thursday and Friday had the same
spread, with 55 percent for Dukakis and 38 percent for Republican
nominee-to-be Bush. The Democratic National Convention ended
Thursday with a well-received acceptance speech by Dukakis.
   The Massachusetts governor's lead in the new Gallup polls were
better than twice the size of his six-point lead in a
pre-convention Gallup poll. Presidential candidates frequently
enjoy a bounce in support after their nominating convention.
   The convention bounce usually settles down as voters focus on
the issues of the race.
   The new Gallup poll had a 3-point margin of error. In addition
to 54 percent for Dukakis and 37 percent for Bush, 9 percent were
undecided.

<HEAD>Pentagon Reports Drug, Alcohol Abuse Declines In Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug and alcohol abuse in the armed forces is
steadily declining from the alarmingly high levels of 1980,
Pentagon officials said Tuesday.
   ``We are pleased with this latest decline, which can be
attributed to the message that has been sent out to all our
military personnel: If you want to stay in, you have to stay off
drugs,'' said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.
   The percentage of military personnel acknowledgng the use of
illicit drugs in the 30 days prior to their being surveyed dropped
from 27 percent in 1980, to 19 percent in 1982, 9 percent in 1985
and 5.5 percent in 1988.
   Alarm bells rang when the results of the first drug survey were
released by the Pentagon in 1980. Comprehensive anonymous surveys
have been conducted in 1980, 1982, 1985 and this year.
   In the latest survey, conducted for the Pentagon by the Research
Triangle Institute, the 17,213 men and women taking part did not
put their names on the forms, and the exercise was not intended to
root out abusers. Those answering the questionaires were chosen to
provide a representative sampling of those in the armed forces by
age, sex, ethnic group, rank and branch of service.
   Military officials also conduct random urine tests of suspected
drug abusers, and those results also show a declining rate of use,
officials say.
   The most common illegal drug was marijuana, used by 3 percent
within the previous 30 days, down from 7 percent in 1985, and by 7
percent within the previous 12 months, down from 11 percent in 1985.
   Marijuana use was highest in the lower enlisted ranks, with 6
percent reporting use within the previous 30 days compared to 11
percent in 1985 and 15 percent within the previous 12 months,
compared to 19 percent in 1985.
   Drinking also fell in the military, according to the survey.
Heavy drinking, defined as consumption of five or more drinks at
least once a week, was reported by 9 percent, down from 12 percent
in 1985.
   And cigarette smoking was down to 57 percent who reported no
puffing in the previous 30 days, compared to 54 percent in 1985.
Twenty-three percent smoked a pack a day or more, compared to 27
percent in 1985.
   The final report, with a more complete breakdown of drug,
alcohol and tobacco use, was to be complete in December, Pentagon
officials said.

<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Miss Teen USA said Tuesday
she's happy to be a winner and doesn't think the disqualification
of a rival detracts from her victory.
   ``I'm really proud of where I am,'' said Mindy Duncan, a
16-year-old from Oregon. ``It was a wonderful experience, it was
such a confidence-booster.''
   Miss Teen California, 16-year-old Alison Moreno of El Toro, was
allowed to participate in the televised pageant Monday night but
was disqualified from competition for rule-breaking, said pageant
spokeswoman Martha Kaiser.
   Publicist Les Schecter said after the Monday night telecast that
Miss Moreno had violated curfew, but Ms. Kaiser on Tuesday refused
to specify the infraction. The 51 girls in the contest were
chaperoned and required to abide by a number of rules during their
three-week stay prior to the pageant.
   Telephone calls to Miss Moreno's home went unanswered Tuesday.
   It was the second time in six weeks that controversy has
interfered with a beauty contest in California.
   On June 13, as the winners of the Miss California contest were
being announced in a televised pageant in San Diego, Michelle
Anderson, 21, of Santa Cruz unfurled a white silk banner that read
``Pageants hurt all women.'' She was hustled from the stage.
   Miss Duncan, who gets cash, a Jeep, furs, jewelry and other
merchandise worth $150,000, said she didn't know Miss Moreno had
been disqualified until right before the show and wasn't told the
reason.
   ``I know nothing about that,'' Miss Duncan said. ``We were told
right on stage that she wouldn't be allowed to participate.''
   A brief disclaimer preceded the CBS telecast of the pageant. At
a gathering afterward, a reporter who persisted in questioning the
contestants about Miss Moreno's disqualification was ordered to
leave by contest officials.
   The semifinalists appeared in bathing suits and evening gowns
for 12 celebrity judges. Each was interviewed by Dick Clark, host
of American Bandstand and the $100,000 Pyramid game show.

   Iranian rebels based in Iraq claimed
Tuesday their forces drove more than 60 miles into Iran, and the
Iranians said their soldiers had killed more than 1,000 of the
``counterrevolutionary elements.''
   A seven-member U.N. team arrived in Tehran to work out details
of a cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old war, which both sides have
offered to accept, and Iraq said it was withdrawing its troops from
Iranian territory.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and the U.N.
secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar, met for 90 minutes in
New York.
   Velayati said afterward: ``We had very constructive and fruitful
talks about the implementation of Resolution 598,'' the cease-fire
resolution the Security Council passed unanimously on July 20, 1987.
   Iraq accepted the resolution soon after it was adopted, on
condition Iran do the same, but the Iranians refused until
reversing their position July 18.
   Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister flew to New York on
Tuesday for similar discussions with Perez de Cuellar. The
resolution calls for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized
borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation
to determine which side started the war.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman urged
both sides to exercise restraint and stop pursuing the war.
   Also on Tuesday, Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Parliament and
armed forces commander-in-chief in Iran, said his country will use
its influence to try to free American hostages held in Lebanon if
Washington releases Iranian assets frozen in the United States. He
spoke on TV, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in
Washington, ``We have heard this kind of thing before, but as far
as we are concerned you just can't link the two. ... No deals. The
clearest signal they could send is to release the hostages.''
   Ali Riza Jaffaer Zada, a spokesman for the Iranian rebel group
Mujahedeen Khalq, said its fighters were advancing on Bakhtaran, a
provincial capital, and had ``liberated hundreds of villages.''
   He said the attack, code-named ``Eternal Light,'' began at 3
a.m. Monday and rebel units had overrun the cities of Karand, about
40 miles inside Iran, and Eslamabad, 20 miles farther.
   The rebel spokesman also claimed the Mujahedeen Khalq's fighting
force, called the National Liberation Army, destroyed the 27th
Revolutionary Guards unit based between Eslamabad and Bakhtaran, 90
miles inside Iran in the central border region.
   Iran acknowledged the invasion, initially blaming it on the
Iraqi army, but said its soldiers had retaken Eslamabad and killed
1,100 rebels.
   Tehran radio said Iraq ``made use of counter-revolutionary
mercenaries to infiltrate the population and to martyr the heroic
men and women there.''
   ``Intense fighting is continuing between the forces of Islam and
counterrevolutionary elements,'' said the broadcast, monitored in
Nicosia.
   Iraq says it is withdrawing from all Iranian territory it
occupied last week after Iran announced its acceptance of the
Security Council resolution.
   On state television, a military spokesman said Iraqi forces had
left Gilan-e Gharb and Salehabad, two Iranian towns, before noon.
   Information minister Latif Nussayif Jassim said Iraqi forces
would complete the withdrawal after ensuring safety for their
troops.
   A war communique issued late Tuesday said Iraqi jet fighters and
helicopter gunships flew 353 combat missions along the 730-mile
border warfront.
   Iraqi officials said earlier their invasions on the central and
southern fronts were designed to smash Iran's weakened war machine
and take more prisoners, apparently to equalize the numbers for
exchange under a truce.
   According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, Iran
held 50,000 Iraqis and Iraq had 13,000 Iranian prisoners before the
past week's fighting.
   Lt. Gen. Martin Vadset, leader of the U.N. team, said in Tehran
he would explore ways to implement and maintain a truce, Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The dispatch, monitored in Nicosia, said the group would be in
Tehran for three days, then fly to Baghdad.
   A separate U.N. team is in Tehran to discuss prisoner exchange.
   IRNA dispatches said Iranian soldiers killed ``at least'' 1,500
Iraqi soldiers overnight and recaptured the border city of
Salehabad, Iranian planes flew 10 sorties against Iraqi border
positions and Iranian forces repelled an attack on Mehran, a city
on the central frontier.
   It claimed Iraq used chemical weapons in an attack east of
Ahwaz, a southwestern provincial capital.

   Israeli troops fatally shot a 13-year-old
Palestinian girl and wounded three youths during fighting Tuesday
in occupied Gaza City, Arab hospital officials reported.
   The army confirmed the girl's death but said it had not
determined the cause.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin toured a detention center in Gaza
and vowed to quell the eight-month old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   ``We don't accept the present level of violence,'' Rabin told
Israel television. ``On the contrary, today we have the methods. It
will take some time but we shall succeed.'' He did not elaborate.
   The military commander of the West Bank lifted a curfew that had
confined more than 120,000 Nablus residents to their homes since
last Thursday, the army announced.
   It said Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna took the action as a gesture of
goodwill for the holiday of Eid al-Adha, the Moslem Feast of
Sacrifice.
   In Gaza, 13-year-old Suheir Fuad Afana of the Beach refugee camp
was critically wounded when she was hit in the stomach by army
gunfire, said a Shifa Hospital surgeon. The girl died on the
operating table, according to the doctor, who spoke on the
condition he not be identified.
   Hospital officials said troops also shot and wounded three boys
ranging in age from 11 to 15 and that all three were hit in the
lower body.
   Army officials confirmed the death but said they were unable to
determine the cause because the family took the girl's body from
the hospital.
   They said an army unit sent to break up a riot in the Beach camp
opened fire when Palestinians ``hurled bricks at it from a close
distance.''
   The army said soldiers fired at the brick throwers and it was
checking to determine if the girl's death was a result of the
shooting.
   A curfew was imposed on the Beach camp, home to about 42,000
Palestinians.
   According to Arab reports, the clashes started about 6 p.m., and
protests continued for several hours after the girl was killed. An
Arab reporter said the body was brought back to the camp where
residents marched, shouting ``Allahu akbar!'' or ``God is great!''
   The fatality brought to 234 the number of Palestinians killed
since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, in which four Israelis also
have died.
   In the West Bank, an army spokesman quoted Mitzna as saying he
lifted curfews after Arab leaders had appealed to the army's civil
administration to ease the restrictions.
   Right-wing Israeli settlers, who built their West Bank homes in
the heart of the Arab city of Hebron, warned of an escalation of
violence following a bomb blast earlier in the day.
   The settlers told Israel army radio they might retaliate for a
small, homemade bomb that caused no injuries when it exploded near
a playground.
   In the West Bank town of Beit Jalla, hundreds of Palestinians
mourned a man killed by soldiers Sunday.
   The mourners draped the dead man's home with outlawed
Palestinian flags, and chanted ``With our spirit and blood, we will
avenge the martyr!''
   Palestinians say Jeris Kunkar, 40, was an innocent passer-by who
was shot to death by troops chasing a stone-throwing group of Arab
youths. The army said Kunkar, who was hit by three bullets, was
shot when a soldier tripped and his gun fired accidentally.
   Troops stayed out of Beit Jalla during the service to reduce
tensions, Israeli radio said.
   In the predominantly Arab Israeli city of Jaffa, near Tel Aviv,
police arrested three Arab citizens suspected of destroying $1.25
million worth of Jewish property through vandalism and arson, the
Itim news agency reported.
   All of the damage was done during the Palestinian uprising, and
the suspects apparently were motivated by sympathies with the Arabs
in the occupied territories, Itim said.

   The judiciary committee, controlled by Democrats, said it wanted
to investigate the departures of Burns and Weld to determine
whether operations of the department were affected by Meese's legal
troubles.
   Weld said that on the morning he and Burns resigned, the
criminal division chief told Meese:
   ``Ed I don't gainsay that there are other reasons why you might
have wanted to push these two projects (a $32 million engine
contract for Wedtech and the Iraqi oil pipeline) _ redeem the
campaign pledge in the South Bronx, save our cities, peace in the
Middle East. That is not the question.''
   ``The question,'' Weld said he conveyed to the attorney general,
``is whether Mr. Meese is taking official actions that he knows are
going to redound to the financial benefit of his friend'' Wallach.
   Meese ``did a lot for Mr. Wallach. No doubt he was front and
center'' for Wallach, said Weld.
   ``Mr. Meese took unusual actions to advance the ends requested
of him by Mr. Wallach,'' said Weld.
   In connection with the Iraqi oil pipeline project involving
Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, ``Mr. Wallach within two hours of
being retained by Mr. Rappaport calls up Ed Meese,'' said Weld.
``There's no doubt in Mr. Wallach's mind about why he has been
retained. Mr. Meese understands that he's been retained by Mr.
Rappaport. Mr. Wallach says `help us with this pipeline.''' Meese
arranged a meeting for Wallach with National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane and the attorney general met briefly on the
pipeline project with then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
   Weld also commented on the $150,000 payment from Rappaport for
Wallach's service which Wallach directed be sent directly to Chinn,
who in effect combined it with Meese's and other investors' money
to obtain hard-to-get brand-new stock issues. Weld said he knew in
April 1987 that Wallach had gone to Meese and told the attorney
general, ``I am worried about how this looks.''
   According to McKay's report issued earlier this month, Meese
testified that Wallach ``was somewhat apprehensive that ... someone
would think that there was something strange about'' the payment.
   Wallach had not reported the $150,000 on his tax return, a fact
which McKay said Wallach ``apparently made no mention'' of to Meese
or Rappaport, said McKay's report. Weld noted that Meese ``did not
relay that conversation (about the disposition of the $150,000) to
anybody else.''
   Even Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was critical of Meese's
relationship with Wallach, but he placed the blame all on Wallach,
saying ``I don't think he was a good friend.'' Of Meese, Hatch
said, ``I don't think there is a dishonest bone in his body. He was
done in by his friends.''
   When Hatch challenged Burns' assertion that morale was low in
the department because of McKay's investigation of Meese, Burns
replied, ``There is no way one can draw down the shade.''
   ``As time went on, it became apparent to me that morale at the
Department of Justice was deteriorating rapidly,'' Burns said in
his prepared testimony. ``I heard complaints everywhere. I heard
stories of employees being embarrassed and ridiculed. One employee
had to leave a party of friends when the personal abuse became
intolerable. Graffiti containing obscenities appeared in the very
halls of the Justice Department. One Justice Department employee
was upbraided by a desk clerk at a hotel on checking in because he
was associated with the Meese Justice Department.''
   ``I say `big deal,''' Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., responded.
Humphrey dismissed the abuse at a party and being upbraided by a
desk clerk as the kind of criticism that is leveled in a time of
great public controversy.
   Asked by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., what they would have done
had they come under criminal investigation, Burns said he would
have ``seriously considered'' stepping aside while Weld said have
``seriously thought about the leave of absence route.''
   Burns said he decided last November that he would leave in
January, and Weld said the issue first came up in a discussion
between the two men in December.
   ``He was more concerned than I at the outset'' about problems
the probe of Meese was causing the Justice Department, Weld said.
``In the end, I passed'' Burns ``on the outside lane'' in terms of
concern leading to a decision to resign.
   Weld said he discussed resignation with Solicitor General
Charles Fried, the department's No. 4 official, the day before
Weld's departure. Weld agreed with a characterization by Humphrey
that he ``planted'' the idea of resigning with Fried, but said he
did not suggest it.
   Regarding their decision to resign the same day, Weld said he
and Burns were ``trying to steer a middle course'' between leaving
silently and holding a news conference on the Justice Department
steps announcing they were quitting in protest. The two remained
silent about their reasons for resigning until the judiciary
committee session.
   Regarding the early April meeting in which he urged Meese to
distance himself from Meese, Burns said the attorney general told
him that Wallach ``is going to be in my office tomorrow morning''
returning from overseas. ``I don't know if Mr. Meese did or he
didn't'' meet with Wallach subsequently, said Burns.
   Because he felt there were obvious violations of ethics
regulations, ``I would have taken a hike whether or not I felt it
was over the line,'' Weld said of his resignation.
   Weld called the Arpil White House discussion with Reagan and
Bush ``a fairly grim meeting'' while Burns said ``things were very
frank and very candid in the extreme.''
   When Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, questioned Weld about who
might have leaked the substance of the White House meeting with
Reagan the day after it occurred, Weld responded, ``I did nothing''
and insisted he ``did everything to prevent it.'' When pressed
about leaking details of private conversations with the president,
he responded, ``Twern't me.''

   President Reagan met with a group of veterans
of the Korean War on Tuesday and ordered flags flown at half staff
on Wednesday in remembrance of the cease-fire that ended the
conflict 35 years ago.
   Reagan met with members of the Korean War Veterans Memorial

chairman of the board.
   He also issued a proclamation declaring the current week as
National Week of Recognition and Remembrance for Those Who Served
in the Korean War.
   He ordered the flags flown at half staff ``as a symbol of our
gratitude to those who died as a result of their service in Korea
and of our steadfast commitment to preserving the values for which
they fought.''
   ``As we approach the 35th anniversary of the cease-fire that
marked the end of active combat in the Korean War, it is
appropriate that we take time to remember and express our gratitude
to those who served in that fierce conflict,'' the president said.
   Reagan's actions were requested in a resolution passed by
Congress.
   Congress two years ago approved construction of a Korean War
Veterans Memorial, to be located on the Mall southeast of the
Lincoln Memorial.
   Construction is likely to be completed early in the next decade.

   Here are some comments Tuesday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, breaking with the Reagan administration by calling
for legislation applying the independent counsel law to Congress:
``Those who take on the people's trust must hold themselves to an
exacting code of conduct. We can expect, and indeed, tolerate
nothing less from the people who work for the government.''
   
   New Hampshire Gov. JOHN SUNUNU, acknowledging Bush sent him
questionnaire forms used in the vice president's search for a
running mate, but refusing to elaborate further: ``I have no
comments on this at this time at all.''
   
   PRESIDENT REAGAN, lambasting Democrats for taking shots at his
administration last week during the Democratic National Convention:
``To hear the opposition talk, you would think growth in our
economy had come to a dead halt.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, saying Reagan should have asked for Attorney
General Edwin Meese's resignation in April after two former Justice
Department officials told the president and Bush that they believed
Meese violated the law: ``I hope I never have a briefing like the
one Mr. Burns and Mr. Weld gave the vice president three months
ago. But if I do, I won't sit there and do nothing.''

<HEAD>Four Opposition Parties Unite to Challenge Gandhi</HEAD>

   Four Indian opposition parties announced
Tuesday they will merge to challenge Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
governing Congress Party.
   The announcement was made by V.P. Singh, a former defense
minister and leader of the Jan Morcha, or the People's Forum.
   Singh said the new party ``would spare no efforts ... to fulfill
the aspirations of the people of India, who are today groaning
under the corrupt and authoritarian rule of the Congress.''
   Singh, a former Gandhi ally turned foe, defeated the Congress
Party candidate for a seat in Parliament in a June by-election in
Uttar Pradesh state.
   The united opposition party, to be called the Samajvadi Janata
Dal, or Socialist People's Party, will be formed by Aug. 15, Singh
said. The decision came after meetings with leaders from Singh's
party, the Janata Party, the Lok Dal and the Congress-S Party. The
Congress-S is a splinter group of Gandhi's party.
   ``The merger will shake these gentlemen a bit _ these Congress
wallahs,'' said veteran opposition leader Biju Patnaik. ``Wallah''
is Hindi for man.
   The new party is expected to field candidates in parliamentary
elections to take place before January 1990.
   Major opposition parties merged into the Janata Party to defeat
the Congress in general elections in 1977, but the government
served only two years of its five-year term.
   The Parliament dissolved in 1979 after the coalition split and
bickered over the choice for prime minister.
   Patnaik said the leadership of the new party has not been
decided.
   The four parties control only two of India's 25 state assemblies
_ northern Haryana and southern Karnataka _ and their members hold
just 21 seats in the 544-member law-making lower house of
Parliament.
   Gandhi's Congress Party holds more than 400 seats in the lower
house, but its fortunes have been declining since it swept to
victory in the 1984 general elections.
   The Congress Party has lost 10 of 14 state elections held since
then. It also lost four of the seven Parliament seats in the
by-elections.
   Much of the Congress Party's decline has been blamed on
allegations of inefficiency and corruption in government.
   News media and opposition politicans have alleged that kickbacks
were paid on major defense contracts and that some money may have
gone to Gandhi allies. The Congress Party has denied that.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Thunderstorms scattered rain and hail over much of the central
and eastern portions of the country Tuesday, but rainfall amounts
were mostly moderate.
   In the South, showers and thunderstorms covered northern
Louisiana, southeastern Arkansas and northwestern Mississippi, as
well as northwestern Florida. Alexandria, La., received just under
three-quarters of an inch of rain in six hours.
   Thunderstorms also stretched from the lower Great Lakes to New
England and down across the central Appalachians. Hail up to one
inch in diameter pelted Wernersville, Pa., while Elmira, N.Y.,
recorded 0.88 inch of rain in the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Rain diminished in the central Plains during the morning, but
thunderstorms were scattered over southern Kansas and northeast
Oklahoma in the afternoon.
   Thunderstorms in northeastern South Dakota dropped half-inch
hail and heavy rain on Aberdeen, and storms also were reported in
Nevada.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures around the nation ranged from 62
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., and North Bend, Ore., to 108
degrees at Palm Springs, Calif. The nation's overnight low was 42
degrees at Pacific City, Ore., and West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Wednesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms to
extend from the Atlantic Coast to the Appalachians, and from
Georgia and Florida to Mississippi and southeast Louisiana.
Scattered showers also were predicted for the eastern part of Upper
Michigan and central Arizona.
   Highs in the 70s and 80s were forecast in much of the East, from
the Great Lakes to New England and the Middle Atlantic states, and
in the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. Highs were forecast to reach 100
degrees or more in northern and central Texas and eastern Montana,
and up to 115 through the desert Southwest. Highs in most other
parts of the nation were expected to be in the 90s.

   A prison inmate was sentenced to 10
years in prison for stabbing another prisoner with a steak bone,
and as a result of the attack inmates in solitary confinement don't
eat T-bone steaks any more.
   A Union County jury Monday convicted Miguel Menendez of
aggravated assault and possession of contraband in the Nov. 11,
1987, stabbing of Fidel Campos at Union Correctional Institution
near Raiford.
   Menendez was sentenced to 10 years for each conviction. The
sentences will be served concurrently.
   Campos was stabbed with the sharpened bone from a T-bone steak
that had been served the previous night to Menendez and other
inmates in solitary confinement, according to court testimony.
   Campos was stabbed in his back and leg and was treated at a
hospital.
   Sgt. M.S. Vinci, who witnessed the attack, testified in the
trial that T-bone steaks should not have been served to inmates
confined for disciplinary reasons.
   ``It was an oversight, passing this kind of bone on to
confinement inmates,'' he said.
   As a result of the attack, the Corrections Department
implemented a new policy that prohibits T-bone steaks and pork
chops with bones from being served to inmates in solitary
confinement, said Paula Tully, a department spokeswoman. Food
service policy did not previously specify cuts of meat that should
not be served.
   Steaks are served to inmates once every six weeks, she said.
   Menendez claimed he stabbed Campos in self defense after the
inmate threatened him and swung a razor blade at him in an exercise
area. Menendez said he found the bone on the ground as Campos
approached.
   He is currently serving a 15-year sentence for trafficking in
cocaine. According to Department of Corrections records, Menendez
entered prison on Dec. 31, 1986.
   Carol Roney, a deputy court clerk in Union County, said Menendez
will not begin serving the new sentences until he completes his
current term.

   One of 22 people charged with running the largest
Asian-based marijuana ring ever uncovered appeared in court Tuesday
for a hearing to expedite his extradition to the United States.
   Nick Jordan, a spokesman for Scotland Yard, the London police
force, identified the prisoner as Chi Chueun Lo, a 29-year-old
travel agent. Neither Scotland Yard nor the court would give Lo's
nationality or the identity of three other men arrested in Britain
Monday.
   On the Spanish Mediterranean island of Majorca, three Britons,
including one man described by U.S. authorities as ``the Marco Polo
of drug trafficking,'' were jailed Tuesday following their arrest
on similar charges. They were among 22 people indicted Monday by a
federal grand jury in Miami.
   The three in Majorca were identified as Dennis Howard Marks, 43,
his wife, Judith Marks, 34, and Geoffrey Kenion, 46.
   U.S. authorities said the ring was led by Marks, an Oxford
University graduate who in the past claimed to be an agent for MI6,
the British counterintelligence agency.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said the group shipped marijuana
from Thailand and hashish from Pakistan, and operated in England,
West Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Australia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States and other nations.
   The authorities said the group amassed $30 million worth of
property that the U.S. government wants confiscated.
   Police agencies from many of the countries involved participated
in the investigation. U.S. authorities called it the largest
Asian-based drug ring ever uncovered.
   In London, the jailer's office at Bow Street magistrate's court
said Lo, whose arrest warrant claims he was importing hashish into
the United States between 1980 and 1988, had been remanded in
custody until Aug. 2.
   Jordan said that British police are still seeking one other man,
and that the three in custody in London are being interviewed prior
to being charged.
   Marks reportedly told a British court following a 1974 arrest on
drug charges that he had been involved in smuggling while trying to
infiltrate the IRA for British intelligence. He was acquitted.
   Marks, his wife and Kenion had been living on Majorca, said
officials in the island city of Palma.
   A Majorca police spokesman, who would not give his name in
keeping with Spanish custom, said it was expected the U.S. request
for extradition would be made and acted upon within the legal limit
of 80 days.
   The police spokesman also described as ``lies'' news reports
that Palma police had arrested a suspected IRA activist named James
McCann along with the Marks and Kenion.
   Six people meanwhile remained in custody Tuesday after police
discovered a cache of 17 tons of hashish in a tunnel north of
Barcelona on Sunday. It was the biggest drug bust in the country's
history.

   A General Services Administration official and
the heads of a North Carolina business were indicted Tuesday by a
federal grand jury on conspiracy, fraud and bribery charges,
according to U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens.
   Named in the seven-count indictment were Lester H. Finotti Jr.,
chief of the accounts management and claims branch of the GSA's
Office of Transportation Audits; William H. White, Jr., president
Southern Investment Co., of Fayetteville, N.C., and Carmine W.
DePietro, the company's executive vice president.
   According to the 23-page indictment, the North Carolina
businessmen paid more than $24,000 over an 18-month period from
March 1985 to September 1986 to Finotti in exchange for his help in
advancing the business interests of Southern Investment. The pair
also provided Finotti with the use of a 1985 red Thunderbird, the
indictment alleged.
   Operating as a factoring agent, the North Carolina-based company
purchased the government bills of lading issued by transportation
companies shipping goods and equipment for the federal government.
According to the indictment, the company bought the bills from
transportation companies at a discount and submitted them to GSA
for payment at face value.
   Finotti was charged with manipulating payment of government
bills of lading for the benefit of Southern Investment.
   White, 59, of Pinehurst, N.C. and Fredericksburg, Va., and
DePietro, 53, also of Fredericksburg, were each charged with one
count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and one count of
bribery of a public official.
   Finotti, 56, of Waldorf, Md., was charged with one count of
conspiracy to defraud the United States, one count of accepting a
bribe, three counts of conflict of interest and one count of making
a false statement on his financial disclosure forms.

   Officials at the overcrowded Maryland
Penitentiary isolated 36 inmates Tuesday who had participated in a
disturbance that injured 12 people, but they still don't know why
the violence erupted.
   Bishop Robinson, the secretary of public safety who is heading
the investigation of the riot, said officials identified the
inmates who took part and isolated them in the south wing of the
downtown, maximum-security prison.
   There is no indication that inmates had planned the uprising,
Robinson said.
   Inmates remained locked in their cells one day after prisoners
attacked guards within a recreation yard and a crisis clinic and a
minor fire was set in the clinic. No one escaped during Monday's
riot and authorities restored order in about an hour.
   Three guards and three inmates remained hospitalized Tuesday,
but none was in serious condition. One of the guards and all three
inmates had suffered gunshot wounds.
   ``The only guns found were those used by the officers, but we
won't know for sure (where the wounding shots came from) until
ballistics checks are in,'' said Beverly Marable, spokeswoman for
the Maryland Division of Correction.
   The violence broke out shortly after a group of prisoners had a
regular meeting with wardens to discuss grievances, Gov. William
Donald Schaefer said.
   ``(The warden) said he was not able to give them possibly the
answers that they wanted,'' Schaefer said.
   Prison officials said they did not know what caused the
violence, though.
   ``The investigation isn't complete enough to be specific as to
who the primary instigators were,'' Ms. Marable said.
   Officials are interviewing guards and inmates, she said.
   The prison, the nation's second oldest, was built in 1811 and is
designed to hold 700 to 800 inmates. It has been chronically
overcrowded, though, and held 1,270 on Monday.
   Former Maryland Attorney General Stephen H. Sachs described
conditions there in 1984 as ``the innermost circle of hell in the
Maryland prison system.'' The prison is slated to be torn down in
several years, and a new maximum security prison built elsewhere.
   Guard Kevin Atkins, 23, was listed in fair condition at Johns
Hopkins Hospital with two fractured elbows, a broken hand, head and
eye injuries and lacerations, hospital officials said.
   At Mercy Medical Center, guard Antoine Givens, 29, was in fair
condition with a gunshot wound to the neck, and guard Russell
Biddle, 50, was in satisfactory condition with stab wounds and head
injuries.
   Inmate Anthony Hughly, 22, was listed in fair condition at Johns
Hopkins with gunshot wounds in the head and neck, and inmate Wymann
Ushry, 25, was in fair condition with a gunshot wound in the head.
   Another unidentified inmate remained in the prison hospital with
a gunshot wound in the foot. Officials did not release his
condition.

   A U.S. District Court judge on Tuesday
struck down the government's appeal and granted bail to a travel
agency owner accused of plotting to kill former White House aide
Oliver North.
   Judge Albert Bryan upheld last week's ruling by a U.S.
magistrate who ordered Mousa Hawamda freed on $250,000 bail.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson has accused Hawamda, a naturalized
American with a Jordanian passport, of participating in a plot to
assassinate a senior government official. Another official has
identified the target as North, who engineered the U.S. aerial
bombing of Libya in April 1986.
   Hawamda is also accused of illegally funneling Libyan government
money for recruiting the support of American dissidents.
   The state has based much of its arguments on information
supplied by two unnamed informants but has so far failed to charge
Hawamda or seven other people arrested in the case last week.
   Bryan said he was convinced Hawamda had sufficient ties in the
United States that he would not flee the country pending resolution
of the case.

<HEAD>Dukakis Slams Bush on Ethics; Bush Says He'll Have ``Exacting
Code''</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 3 grafs on Jackson meeting with aides</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis slammed George
Bush on Tuesday for taking a ``do-nothing'' approach to Attorney
General Edwin Meese's legal difficulties. Bush said if he wins the
White House he will hold officials to an ``exacting code of
conduct.''
   Dukakis, who formally won the Democratic presidential nomination
last week, also criticized Bush for not trying to block the
arms-for-hostages deal at the center of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Bush, who receives the GOP nomination at the Republican National
Convention next month, said that civil penalties as well as
criminal sanctions should be used to punish ethical violations by
government officials. He said conflict of interest laws should be
broadened to include Congress. Departing from Reagan administration
policies, Bush also endorsed the use of independent counsels to
investigate wrongdoing.
   Dukakis, boosted by the positive reaction from the Democratic
National Convention, led Bush by 17 points in the latest Gallup
poll of 1,001 registered voters conducted Friday through Saturday.
   The survey, reported Tuesday by radio station WEEI in Boston,
found Dukakis with 54 percent support to 37 percent for Bush. The
poll reflected the frequent bounce enjoyed by presidential
candidates after their nominating conventions.
   Nine percent were undecided in the survey, which had a margin of
error of 4 percent.
   The two would-be presidents debated ethics long distance as the
current occupant of the White House told reporters that the
rhetoric at last week's Democratic National Convention got ``my
Irish up.''
   ``To hear the opposition talk, you would think growth in our
economy had come to a dead halt,'' said President Reagan.
   Republicans were at work readying the Superdome for next month's
national convention in New Orleans, while Atlanta was settling back
to normal after last week's invasion of the Democrats.
   Security officials said the lost and found bins in the
Democratic convention city were overflowing with items such as a
woman's silk suit, eyeglasses, keys, watches and wallets. They said
anything unclaimed after 90 days would be turned over to the
Salvation Army.
   The Federal Election Commission voted to release $46 million in
federal campaign funds that Dukakis is entitled to as the
Democratic nominee. The 6-0 vote came despite objections from a
Republican group complaining about Lloyd Bentsen's dual campaigns
as Dukakis' vice presidential running mate and as a senator seeking
re-election from Texas.
   Bentsen tended to his Senate duties, chairing a meeting of the
Finance Committee at which legislation was approved to correct
errors in the landmark 1986 tax overhaul bill.
   Bush, his nomination secure for early next month, proposed
rewriting conflict of interest rules that govern federal employees
to cover a wider variety of misconduct, and he said members of
Congress should be covered by the law.
   ``Those who take on the people's trust must hold themselves to
an exacting code of conduct. We can expect, and indeed, tolerate
nothing less from the people who work for the government,'' he said
in a speech before congressional interns at the Library of Congress
in Washington.
   He said he would establish a new office, senior counselor to the
president, whose first responsibility would be ethics issues.
   Bush complained that the present system of federal ethics law
``is a confused quiltwork of executive policy statements,
administrative regulations, criminal laws. Indeed, virtually every
agency of government issues its own set of standards of conduct.''
   It was the second time in several days that Bush has tried to
ease a campaign problem.
   Democrats have long campaigned against the alleged ``sleaze'' of
the Reagan administration, and the vice president's ethics speech
seemed designed to reassure the voters on that score. Over the
weekend, in a proposal widely viewed as an attempt to increase his
appeal to female voters, he called for giving tax breaks to
low-income mothers to help pay for child care.
   He said he didn't intend to discuss ethical questions about
Meese.
   But Dukakis did.
   At a news conference in Boston, he said the American people
``are embarrassed and ashamed by some of the things that they see''
in the Reagan administration, including the handling of misconduct
allegations against Meese.
   Dukakis said Reagan should have asked for Meese's resignation
and Bush should have demanded his ouster immediately after two
former Justice Department officials told the president and vice
president in April that they believed Meese had violated the law.
   ``I hope I never have a briefing like the one Mr. Burns and Mr.
Weld gave the Vice President three months ago,'' Dukakis said.
``But if I do, I won't sit there and do nothing.''
   Dukakis referred to former Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns
and Assistant Attorney General William Weld, who told Congress
earlier in the day they briefed Reagan and Bush in April.
   Weld testified that he thought Meese had probably committed
felonies while in office, although independent counsel James McKay
said earlier this month he would not seek a criminal indictment.
Meese, contending the McKay report vindicated him, has announced
plans to resign.
   On another topic, Dukakis denied reports that he plans to resign
as Massachusetts governor to pursue his quest for the White House.
   Meanwhile, Jesse Jackson, who contested the Democratic
nomination until last week, met with aides in Chicago to map out
the next phase of his involvement in the campaign.
   ``Fundamentally it was about pulling everyone together to kind
of wrap up the Atlanta convention, to sort things out, to lay out
our basic plan and the various tracks,'' said Jackson's longtime
aide Frank Watkins.
   Watkins said the transition of some Jackson aides to the Dukakis
campaign was discussed, but said no specifics about Jackson's role
had yet been decided.

<TEXT>
   Political jockeying over where to locate a new
defense reactor to produce raw materials for nuclear weapons
spilled into the open Tueday at a Senate subcommittee hearing.
   Energy Department officials testifying before the Senate
Appropriations Committe's energy and water development subcommittee
offered no clues as to what the department will recommend, but
various members of the committee tried to put their own spin on
what an advisory panel's report had found.
   ``We should not gamble with the nation's security and go with an
unproven technology,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., adding
that the Savannah River complex in his state long had been involved
in producing materials for nuclear weapons.
   Hollings facetiously suggested that the ideal solution was to
build two new production reactors at Savannah River, one in Idaho
and convert a mothballed plant at the Hanford nuclear reservation
in Washington state.
   ``But I question whether we have the money,'' Hollings said.
   Hollings took note of the split in the Washington state
congressional delegation over whether to convert the mothballed
plant.
   ``One senator says we should and another says we shouldn't,''
Hollings said.
   Washington Republican Sen. Dan Evans supports the conversion
proposal and Washington Democratic Sen. Brock Adams opposes it.
Neither are members of the appropriations committee.
   DOE is scheduled to unveil by the end of the month its
recommendation on where to locate the new production reactor and
what technology to use.
   Possible sites for the multibillion-dollar reactor, which would
produce tritium, include the Savannah River complex near Aiken,
S.C., the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls,
and the Hanford reservation in southcentral Washington state.
   A report from an Energy Department advisory panel, while making
no recommendations, concluded that construction of a new
heavy-water reactor at Savannah River offered the ``best chance''
of ensuring a steady supply of tritium, a key radioactive
ingredient in nuclear weapons.
   The report, however, did not completely rule out any of the
other options, including converting a mothballed Washington Public
Power Supply System nuclear plant at the Hanford reservation.
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, said he had no objection to
building a new production reactor at Savannah River, but urged that
at least one more be built at a different location to avoid putting
``all our eggs in one basket.''
   McClure said building only one reactor at one site could expose
`` our national security unecessarily to events that can bring us
to our knees in terms of nuclear deterrence capabilities
   ``Whether it's an act of God, a terrorist attack, an unfortuante
safety concern or an unanticipated design flaw, we could find
ourselves without any production capability if we select only one
site or one technology.''
   McClure said his chief concern was national security and if a
site other than Idaho was selected it would be ``fine with me.
   ``My goal isn't simply to get a reactor built in Idaho.''
   Oregon Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield, who opposes conversion of
the nuclear plant at Hanford, said he thought conversion would
violate nuclear non-proliferation laws as it would involve using a
civilian reactor for defense purposes.
   ``I'm deeply concerned about the implications,'' Hatfield said.
   The nation's three existing defense production reactors, located
at Savannah River, have been operating at less than 50 percent of
full power because of safety concerns.

   There are ``significant problems and
limitations'' in the Pentagon's fledgling try-before-you-buy
program, as evidenced by flawed planning and testing of the Navy's
Aegis air defense system and five other major weapons, the General
Accounting Office said Tuesday.
   The five-year-old program, ordered by Congress, still is ``not
adequate to assess'' whether the weapons will work in combat, the
congressional watchdog agency reported.
   The GAO review centered on the Pentagon's Office of Operational
Test and Evaluation, which is headed by Jack Krings, a former
lobbyist for McDonnell Douglas. It was the second time in two years
the GAO had criticized the operation of the office.
   Congress created the office in 1983 as part of an effort to do a
more realistic job of testing weapons. The legislation was
triggered by the discovery of serious flaws in several major
weapons systems after they were well into development.
   Among those weapons were the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle,
which has been plagued with problems, and the Army's Sergeant York
gun, which was canceled because of poor performance, but not until
more than $1.5 billion had been spent on it.
   The GAO review looked at the testing of six new major weapons,
including the Navy's Aegis air defense, the sophisticated tracking
system that was involved in the July 3 shootdown by the Navy
cruiser Vincennes of an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf. The
Pentagon says the shootdown was a case of mistaken identity.
   The other weapons reviewed by the GAO included the Army's Aquila
drone plane; The Army's helicopter improvement program; Navy
Tomahawk conventional cruise missile; the newest targeting system
for the Air Force Maverick missile; and the Air Force LANTIRN
system for night-time targeting.
   ``We found significant problems and limitations in the planning,
execution, realism, analysis, and service test agency reporting of
the six'' programs, the GAO said.
   ``Some of these problems are limitations were unavoidable due to
time, resource or safety constraints, although numerous others were
not,'' it said.
   The report was released by the Congressional Military Reform
Caucus, a group of 140 legislators created to seek Pentagon
management changes.
   Members of the caucus told a news conference that Krings should
quit. ``It's time for Mr. Krings to resign,'' said Rep. Denny
Smith, R-Ore., ``the sooner the better.''
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Dan Howard said ``I haven't seen the
report. It is my understanding that GAO was instructed not to
contact DOD for its views on the matter. So we will have to wait
and see.''
   ``I have a comment in general terms,'' Howard added. ``I have
seen several of these stories recently put out by certain
congressmen ... The difficulty is that those who do not wish to
inform themselves, who very carefully guard their ignorance,
obviously are not going to learn about the details of our testing
programs.
   ``The stories attacking the Aegis system that I saw in the press
by and large were four-year-old stories. They were based on an
earlier phase of the Aegis testing program, in 1983, and subsequent
to those tests and those reports, an additional $30 million worth
of testing was done on Aegis and it performed magnificently in
those tests.''
   Other Pentagon comment came from spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi, who
said ``this attack on Mr. Krings is inappropriate and unjustified.
... We feel that Mr. Krings is successfully carrying out the
responsibilities of his office.''
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., said, ``we need a back-to-basics
approach to weapons testing. Approving a weapon that doesn't work
is like graduating a high school student who can't read. It's easy,
but it hurts everybody.''
   Congress had ordered that testing be as realistic and close to
combat-type conditions as possible, but that wasn't done, the GAO
said.
   For example, ``the prevailing problem for operational users was
that they were selected from an operator pool that was atypically
high in skill or experience level _ that is, so-called `golden
crews,''' the review said.
   Another example cited was the fact that in some case,
contractors were permitted to help military crews maintain the
weapons ``although that contractor support would not be available
in the field,'' it said.
   When the test data was available, it was often wrongly
interpreted, the GAO said.
   ``In five of six cases, we found problems with the various
assumptions underlying the analyses of the test data,'' it said.
``In at least two cases, such assumptions led to overly optimistic
estimates of the system's capability, one of which was contracted
by available data.''
   There were other ``questionable practices'' in interpreting data
and their impact ``was significant,'' the GAO said. ``They
frequently allowed a system to appear to meet its performance
requirements.''
   Among the flaws cited by the report was the fact that crews used
for both the Army helicopter tests and Maverick tests were
specifically trained for the tests, rather than being normal crews;
and tests of the Tomahawk occurred only over pre-tested fight
routes.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager fighting the most malignant type
of brain tumor is being treated with a relatively new technique
that involves inserting tubes and radioactive beads into his head.
   Michael Anderson, 18, was a week away from graduating from
Wolbach High School this spring when he suffered a seizure. Doctors
found he had a brain tumor just under 2 inches in diameter.
   Dr. Kevin Shewe, a radiation oncologist at Omaha's Clarkson
Hospital, said standard therapy for the fast-growing tumor is
surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy, but the average
patient survives only 40 to 50 weeks.
   About 20 percent of patients live two years; none has survived
five.
   The new procedure combines surgery, chemotherapy and external
and internal radiation, and doctors hope it will increase
Anderson's survival rate.
   Preliminary tests on the newer treatment indicated the median
survival time for patients has been extended to 87 weeks, Shewe
said.
   The treatment is a five-step process, Shewe said.
   The first involves completing in three weeks rather than six the
external radiation given before surgery. The compact treatment time
may increase the effectiveness, Shewe said. The second step,
chemotherapy, takes place concurrently, the doctor said.
   Step three is surgery to remove the tumor.
   Step four for Anderson began when tiny radioactive beads were
inserted through his scalp and into the center and around the tumor
site to attack any remaining tumor cells, doctors said.
   The procedure utilizes sophisticated imaging equipment that
shows cross-sections of the brain and a computer that helps plot
the precise location of the tumor site.
   Neurosurgeon John Greene drilled seven tiny holes in the skull
and inserted seven tubes, or catheters, each less than a tenth of
an inch in diameter. Each of the tubes was glued to a tiny button
sewn to the scalp to hold it in place.
   A brain scan ensured the catheters were correctly positioned,
and Shewe then inserted the radioactive beads. The radioactive
materials remain at the tumor site for 96 hours before being
removed.
   Anderson is scheduled to go home this week. He'll return for
chemotherapy once every six weeks for a year, the fifth step in the
therapy.
   Use of the implant began in 1977. In 1980, doctors first used
the insertable catheter tubes with removable caps.
   And in 1983, at the University of California at San Francisco,
doctors began to use the implants to treat patients with so-called
``high-grade tumors.''

   Weary negotiators went home to sleep Tuesday
after 20 hours of talks and a mediator's deadline failed to produce
a settlement in the Writers Guild strike that has crippled
Hollywood.
   Representatives of the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance
of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke off talks about 11
a.m. Tuesday. The talks, which featured two federal mediators, had
begun at 3 p.m. the day before.
   One of the mediators, Floyd Wood, district director for the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, said no new sessions
were scheduled. He declined to discuss what had happened in the
talks or characterize them in any way.
   On Monday, Wood had set a midnight deadline for an end to the
talks, but declined to say what he would do if the no settlement
was reached by that time. When the hour came, he extended the
deadline.
   The series of talks that began Saturday were the first between
full bargaining teams for both sides in a month.
   Del Reisman, co-chairman of the WGA's negotiating committee,
said Tuesday that he was neither ``discouraged nor encouraged'' by
the contract talks. The WGA strike, which began March 7, is now
entering its 21st week.
   Both sides in the strike have been asked by a federal mediator
to maintain a news blackout, and detailed information about the
bargaining sessions has been scant.
   But a source familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said there were some signs of progress Tuesday. The
source indicated that the WGA and the producers had begun to
address in earnest the divisive issue of television residual
payments.
   Throughout the protracted strike, which has led to sweeping
layoffs in Hollywood, the writers and the producers have disagreed
sharply over payments for one-hour television shows rebroadcast
domestically and all television programs rebroadcast overseas.
   Brian Walton, executive director of WGA West, said the talks had
left him drained, and that he was going home to sleep.
   The union said it was proceeding with plans to picket the
offices of television producer Aaron Spelling and Warner Bros. and
Columbia studios Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, a collection of some of Hollywood's top writers are
taking out full-page advertisements in Wednesday's issues of
entertainment industry newspapers in a show of support for guild
leaders.
   The advertisement is signed by 150 writers, directors and
producers, including makers of the television shows ``Family
Ties,'' ``Cheers'' and ``thirtysomething,'' and the films ``Down
and Out in Beverly Hills'' and ``Sunset Boulevard.''
   It is being published in response to actions by a group of
dissident writers who are threatening to resign from the WGA if the
strike is not ended immediately.
   ``I signed the ad because I was afraid that the producers
alliance might be waiting to see what the fallout would be, who
would break ranks,'' said Allan Burns, a creator of the ``Mary
Tyler Moore Show.'' ``The alliance shouldn't count on anyone
breaking ranks.''
   Lionel Chetwynd, a spokesman for the dissident group, the
Writers Coalition, dismissed the advertisement Tuesday. And he said
his group feared that the recess of negotiations may mean that
contract talks have collapsed.
   ``We're very pessimistic,'' Chetwynd said. ``We are horrified
that after all these talks, they can't close a deal.''

<HEAD>House OKs Measure To Protect Atlantic Striped Bass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House agreed on Tuesday to extend a law
that proponents say has reversed a severe decline in Atlantic
striped bass over a 12-state region.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., chairman of the House Merchant
Marine and Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife, said
the striped bass is ``making a strong comeback'' because of the
1984 law.
   The Studds legislation, which passed the House on a voice vote,
would extend the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act and an
emergency striped base study for three more years.
   ``There are encouraging signs in some areas that the stocks may
be on the road to recovery, but the act must be reauthorized to
assure that the recovery continues,'' said Rep. Walter B. Jones,
D-N.C., chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee.
   The law allows the 12 Atlantic Coast states from Maine to North
Carolina, plus the District of Columbia, to create and monitor
their own striped bass conservation programs, but the states must
comply with guidelines set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
Commission.
   Under the statute, the federal government can declare a
moratorium on all striped bass fishing in states that do not
comply. The states have complied and no moratorium has been
declared.
   Dramatic declines in striped bass were seen in the late 1970s,
spurring the original congressional action.
   The Reagan administration supports extension of the conservation
act, but not the striped bass study. The legislation would cost an
estimated $5 million through fiscal year 1991.
   A similar measure is pending in the Senate Environment
subcommittee on environmental protection.
   The House also passed on a voice vote another committee bill
that would make several changes to the national marine sanctuaries
program. The measure by Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., chairman of the
oceanography subcommittee, would speed up the government's
procedures for designating new sites.
   Only seven U.S. coastal areas have received the designation _
and the accompanying special federal protections _ since the law
was enacted 1972.

<HEAD>Woman Surrenders After Holding Sports Psychologist Hostage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman with a target pistol held top
sports psychologist Jeff Bond hostage for nearly 2{ hours Tuesday
and about six shots were fired before she released him unharmed and
surrendered, police said.
   The siege took place at the Australian Institute of Sport, where
Bond holds consultations. The Australian psychologist works closely
with many of this nation's leading athletes, including former
Wimbledon tennis champion Pat Cash.
   The woman was reported to be a member of the Australian pistol
shooting team, but police would not confirm that. Police spokesman
Sgt. Bill Mackey said police would question the woman, who was not
identified.
   Mackey said he did not know if she had been dropped from the
Australian Olympic shooting team, as local radio stations reported.
   Public relations officer John Purnell said the woman, a shooter
and part-time student studying for a Ph.D., went to consult Bond at
the institute's Sports Science and Medical Center late Tuesday
afternoon.
   Mackey said that a short time later, the psychologist called in
a doctor because ``a difficult situation was developing.''
   The police spokesman said a shot was fired, apparently from the
target pistol the woman had taken with her, and the doctor ran from
the room and called police.
   Mackey said he believed up to five more shots were fired.
   The area was evacuated during the siege, while Bond was held
captive. The woman made only one demand, asking for a hot meal.
   About 30 police were at the scene and set up road blocks.
   ``The main thing is that everyone is out safely,'' Mackey said
when the crisis ended.
   Bond is widely credited with having been a major figure behind
the scenes in Cash's men's singles triumph at the 1987 Wimbledon
championships.
   Earlier this month, Bond was with Cash in London when the player
lost at Wimbledon.
   Bob Hobson, director of Institute Corporate Services, said about
300 athletes now are active at the institute, with an additional
170 administrators, coaches and staff.
   He estimated that more than 100 of the athletes were members of
the Australian Olympic squad preparing for the Seoul Games in
September.

   A woman whose legs were crushed when a
construction crane collapsed on her and whose bravery during the
rescue won the nation's admiration will collect nearly $10 million
for the injuries she suffered.
   Brigitte Gerney will receive $1 million immediately, $27,625 a
month for a year, then the same monthly payment for the rest of her
life with a compounded 3 percent increase each year, it was
announced Tuesday.
   Mrs. Gerney, 52, was injured in May 1985 when a 35-ton crane,
operated by an unlicensed worker, fell on her legs as she passed a
site where a 42-story apartment house was being built.
   She told of the pain she went through when she testified at the
trial of Lino Palmieri, the site foreman, and Crimmins Construction
Co., the company Palmieri worked for.
   ``I heard all the bones cracking,'' she said. ``I screamed for
help. `Help me! Help me! Get me out!'''
   She said she lay beneath the crane for six hours, in agony and
with her legs crushed, while Detective Paul Ragonese pleaded with
her to hang on to life.
   The payment, which settles a lawsuit filed by Mrs. Gerney
against Crimmins and a number of other defendants, was reached
after a session Monday in the courtroom of a New York trial judge,
David B. Saxe. The judge offered guidance to the participants but
did not hold a formal hearing.
   The money is to be paid to Mrs. Gerney through an annuity the
defendants are setting up with an insurance company. The defendants
in the lawsuit include the city, Crimmins, and several other
construction-related companies.
   The suit was filed shortly after the criminal case ended in
spring 1986.
   Palmieri, 54, was fined $5,000, put on five years' probation and
ordered to perform community service for allowing an unqualified
person, Richard Ricciardi, to operate the crane. Crimmins
Construction was fined $10,000.
   Ricciardi, 31, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, was
sentenced to a few months in jail and was placed on probation.
   Mrs. Gerney underwent at least seven operations on her legs.
President Reagan called her during her recovery and Nancy Reagan
visited. Mayor Edward I. Koch threw a party for her.
   The settlement said that in the event of Mrs. Gerney's death,
her estate will receive the money for a minimum of 20 years. The
total for a 20-year period would be $9,906,738. Her life expectancy
is 29 years, said her lawyer, Robert Conason.
   Mrs. Gerney could not be reached for comment and Conason would
not disclose her whereabouts. ``She's a very private person,'' he
said. ``She instructed us to say nothing.''

   An earthquake rocked central Chile
Tuesday evening but no victims or damage were reported, authorities
said.
   The quake measured 4.8 on the Richter scale, according to the
Seismological Institute of the University of Chile in Santiago.
   It was felt in an area about 125 miles long in central Chile,
including Santiago, the capital city of 4.5 million people.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake measuring 4 on the Richter scale can cause
moderate damage, and one measuring 5 can cause considerable damage.

   The International Press Institute said Tuesday it
has written South African President P.W. Botha protesting his
nation's plan to require the registration of journalists.
   The institute, which has about 2,000 journalists, editors and
publishers among its members, said the step increases the South
African government's ``already deplorable degree of control over
the media.''
   IPI director Peter Galliner urged Botha to withdraw the
``repressive'' policy saying it would ``allow the government to
have ultimate control over who may practice as a journalist.''
   Under regulations published June 10 by the South African
government, anyone carrying out ``news agency'' business must be
registered with the government beginning July 31 or face a 10-year
prison term or a $10,000 fine.

   Mine workers and the government held
negotiations Tuesday aimed at ending a nationwide strike affecting
Peru's silver production, officials said. No progress was
immediately reported.
   The National Federation of Mine, Metal and Steel Workers and the
Labor Ministry said the first negotiations since the strike began
July 18 were held Monday and Tuesday.
   The federation, which claims to represent 75 percent of Peru's
estimated 80,000 to 100,000 mine workers, said strikers are
demanding that all labor contracts for individual unions be
negotiated jointly.
   The federation said more than 90 percent of the mining industry
has been paralyzed by the strike. Industry analysts, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the figure was closer to 60 percent.
   Peru is the world's second leading producer of silver behind
Mexico and a major source of copper, lead, zinc and gold. Mining
traditionally accounts for half of Peru's exports.
   The government said last week it would not sign new sales
contracts for state-controlled silver, about 42 percent of the
nation's annual output of 60 million ounces, in an effort to boost
its dwindling foreign reserves.
   Peru's decision to boost its dwindling reserves is part of an
effort to secure credits to combat consumer shortages and help the
economy by importing food and capital goods.
   The government hopes to use its silver reserves as security to
finance up to $600 million in import credits, the official gazette
El Peruano reported Tuesday.

   A property tax bill completed its stormy passage
through Parliament Tuesday when the House of Lords backed down from
threats to amend it.
   The House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament,
decided without a vote to not act on some members's demands that
changes be made in the measure. Opponents of the bill said the
proposed flat-rate community tax is unfair to the poor.
   ``The government themselves are likely to come to regret today's
decision,'' said Lord Allen of Abbeydale.
   The bill is expected to be approved later this week by Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pledged in the 1987 election
campaign to revise the system of local property taxes known as the
``rates'' that help finance local governments.
   Advocates of the new plan said the old rates system was unfair
because the burden was not shared equally, falling on local
businesses and some householders while other people paid nothing.
   The new measure will replace the rates with a flat-rate system
of payments. Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party government calls
the new system a community charge to be paid by almost everyone.
Critics said it will especially hurt the poor because, unlike a
graduated income tax, it takes no account of a person's ability to
pay.
   The House of Lords withdrew its challenge to the measure in the
face of a constitutional clash with the elected House of Commons.
The Commons approved the proposal in April.
   The House of Lords has no power to interfere with the
government's taxation legislation but can delay enactment of other
laws for up to 13 months.
   Members of the House of Lords who wanted to ammend the tax
measure said the bill did not come under the House of Commons'
``financial privilege'' because it affected local government.
   ``Though we should respect Commons financial privilege with the
greatest care, we should also respect our own privileges and
feelings and should not allow them to be eroded or diminished,''
said Lord Henderson of Brompton during the debate that lasted
nearly three hours.
   But Lord Hailsham said the House of Commons always had claimed
privileges when introducing general taxes. ``It is the duty of any
(government) minister to insist on privilege and give no further
reasons'' for rejecting amendments by the House of Lords, he said.

<HEAD>Marcos Denies Report of $5 Billion Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposed Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
on Tuesday denied a newspaper report that he offered the Philippine
government $5 billion to allow him to return to his homeland
without fear of criminal prosecution.
   ``My going home depends on principle, not cash,'' Marcos said.
``Yes, negotiations are going on, as they have for the past several
months, but money is not involved.''
   Later, through a spokesman, Marcos indicated he wouldn't discuss
details of the negotiations, on the advice of his attorney. He said
he had records that could prove he didn't offer any money.
   A professor quoted in the story published by the Los Angeles
Times on Tuesday also said it was inaccurate.
   A. James Gregor, political science professor and Philippines
expert at the University of California at Berkeley, was quoted by
the Times as saying Marcos offered to return $5 billion to the
Philippines, support President Corazon Aquino and stay out of
politics to ensure his return to his home province of Ilocos Norte.
   ``I heard that figure second- or third-hand during a meeting
with a Philippine official,'' Gregor said. ``I have no direct
knowledge of money being offered by anyone. I have heard figures,
but indirectly, ranging from $250 million to $20 billion.''
   Tom McCarthy, the night news editor in the Times' Washington
bureau who edited the story, stood by the report.
   ``It accurately reflects what we were told by him (Gregor) and
other sources,'' he said.
   Marcos has been living in Hawaii since he was deposed in
February 1986. The Philippines is trying to recoup billions of
dollars Marcos allegedly siphoned out of the country during his
reign.
   Gregor said Tuesday he met in June in Washington with members of
Congress as well as Philippine ambassador Emmanuel Pelaez to
discuss ways to negotiate Marcos' return. It was during a meeting
that included Pelaez that money was mentioned, he said.
   Gregor said he advised U.S. and Philippine officials against
indicting Marcos in the United States because it would set a
dangerous precedent for future political exiles. Instead, he
suggested that Marcos be allowed to return to his homeland as long
as he promised he and his family would stay out of politics.
   Pelaez sent the suggestion to Mrs. Aquino even though he favors
prosecuting Marcos for allegedly taking funds from the Philippines,
Gregor said.
   Gregor said he saw one document during the negotiations that was
addressed to Mrs. Aquino and signed by Marcos. He said it did not
mention any payment.
   A State Department spokesman said Tuesday the United States was
not involved in the negotiations but that Marcos would have to get
permission to return from the Philippine government before the
United States would let him leave Hawaii.

   The U.N. secretary-general met twice with
Iran's foreign minister Tuesday in the first formal round of talks
to put a cease-fire into effect in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
   Ali Akbar Velayati said after the first afternoon meeting with
U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar that the talks were
``constructive and fruitful'' and covered the steps to carry out a
truce and peace plan.
   Perez de Cuellar has said he hopes next week he can announce the
dates for a cease-fire.
   ``We are trying to set a timetable for the implementation plan
of the secretary-general and we also talked about the recent
escalation of the war on our border with the Iraqis,'' Velayati
told reporters at the end of second talks Tuesday night.
   ``We said (to the secretary-general) that if they continue their
attack, we will give them a lesson that they won't forget,''
Velayati said.
   Perez de Cuellar is to hold separate talks with Velayati and
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on Wednesday. The U.N. chief said
he dispensed with formalities and begin intensive peace talks
Tuesday, one day ahead of schedule, because the Iranian envoy
already had arrived.
   Velayati came to New York Monday and Aziz arrived Tuesday. Aziz
did not make an arrival statement.
   Before meeting with Perez de Cuellar, Velayati told reporters
Tuesday that Iraq was trying to sabotage the peace process by
invading Iran and using chemical wapons on a large scale.
   ``The war is still going on very seriously,'' he said, despite
Iraq's statements it was withdrawing from Iranian territory.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman urged
Iran and Iraq to exercise maximum restraint, saying, ``Continuation
of fighting does nothing to enhance the common goal of a negotiated
settlement.''
   Velayati and Perez de Cuellar discussed implementation of
Security Council Resolution 598, which was passed unanimously on
July 20, 1987, and which demands an immediate cease-fire in the
Persian Gulf conflict. It also calls for withdrawal to recognized
borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation
to determine which side started the war.
   Iraq quickly accepted the resolution last year on condition Iran
do the same, but Iran waited until last week, July 18, before
announcing its acceptance.
   Although Iraq asked for direct talks with Iran in New York,
Perez de Cuellar said he would not try to compel the two sides to
meet face to face initially.
   While talks were under way in New York, two U.N. teams were at
work in Tehran, the Iranian capital. One was laboring over truce
details and the other was inquiring into the prisoners-of-war
situation.
   The cease-fire would be monitored and supervised by about 250
U.N. peacekeeping troops.
   Vernon A. Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said Tuesday on the CBS television program ``This Morning'' that it
would be possible to work out a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq in
the next two months.
   U.N. officials have said the U.N. budget crisis will make it
hard, perhaps impossible to finance the peacekeeping force, unless
the United States and other debtors pay their arrears.
   Such a force could cost $20 million to $30 million a year,
according to early estimates.
   Francoic Giuliani, spokesman for the secretary-general, told
reporters Tuesday the organization is expected to run out of
operating funds at the end of October.
   Washington has been withholding full dues payments to demand
U.N. spending reforms.

<HEAD>North Korea Again Demands It Co-Host Olympic Games</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea, in a letter released
Tuesday, said it would consider participating in the Olympic Games
in Seoul but repeated its demand to be a co-host of the event that
begins in September.
   The letter, which came as a suprise to South Korean leaders,
linked negotiations on the Olympics with an earlier North Korean
proposal that the two countries hold parliamentary talks on a
non-aggression pact.
   It said in part, ``We propose with courtesy that the scheduled
North-South joint parliamentary conference be held within August at
the latest before the opening of the Olympics and discuss as an
urgent agenda such issues as your request for our participation in
the Olympics and our proposal for its co-hosting.''
   There was no immediate comment from the South Korean government,
which has not yet responded to the earlier North Korean letter
calling for parliamentary talks.
   The peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea in 1945 at the end of World War II. They
fought a war in 1950-53 and remain enemies.
   The Olympic Games are to be held Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in Seoul.
   When North Korea's demand that it be a co-host of the games was
rejected it announced a boycott.
   South Korea and the International Olympic Committee have said
some events could be held in the North, but that the Games are
awarded to a single host city and not to countries.
   The committee has said North Korea could stage archery, table
tennis, women's volleyball, preliminary soccer games and a cycling
road race. North Korea insisted on more, including its own opening
and closing ceremonies in Pyongyang, the capital, and a share of
television revenue.
   Seoul Olympic officials have said the invitation to North Korea
to participate would remain open until the last possible minute in
hopes of promoting North-South reconciliation.
   Aides to Kim Chae-sun, speaker of South Korea's National
Assembly, said the new letter was from Yang Hyong Sop, chairman of
North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly. It was received at the
border truce village of Panmunjom.
   South Korea's political leaders had been trying to resolve
differences before sending a unified response to North Korea's
earlier letter calling for talks on a non-aggression conference.
   Many have been reluctant to agree to full-scale parliamentary
talks, saying preliminary negotiations are needed.
   North Korea is one of six countries that have not accepted
invitations to the Olympics. The others are Cuba, Ethiopia,
Albania, Nicaragua and the Seychelles.
   A record 12,000 athletes from 161 nations are expected to
compete in the Games.

<HEAD>Eleven New York Postal Workers Accused of Throwing Away Mail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten postal workers were charged Tuesday with
dumping nearly 60,000 pieces of mail into a trash bin behind a
Brooklyn post office.
   The workers threw away 59,700 pieces of mail between April and
June, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Brooklyn.
In at least one instance, a supervisor was standing nearby as the
mail was dumped, officials charged.
   Most of the discarded mail was bulk mail but about 5 percent was
second-class magazines and newspapers, the complaint said. Sixty
first-class letters also were thrown out.
   The mail carriers, many of them in uniform, were released on
their own recognizance after a brief appearance before U.S.
Magistrate John L. Caden.
   The Postal Inspection Service began investigating after
receiving information that carrier Vincent Slikas had thrown the
contents of a mailbag into a trash bin behind a Brooklyn post
office April 6. Postal officials found 51 pieces of mail in the
bin, the complaint said.
   From April 11 to 19, an informant saw Slikas allegedly dump more
mail. Postal officials digging through the bin found mail that
should have been delivered by Slikas and other carriers, the
complaint alleges.
   On May 17, postal inspectors secretly placed a video camera in
the rear vestibule of the post office near the trash bin.
   Between May 18 and June 21, the camera recorded Slikas and nine
other carriers dumping mail there, the complaint alleged. The 11th
defendant, post office superintendent Gil A. Holmes, allegedly
stood near the trash bin as the carriers tossed in mail, the
complaint said.
   Conviction on the charge of destroying mail carries a possible
six-month prison sentence and $500 fine.

   Former President Leopoldo
Galtieri and two top commanders jailed by a military court after
the 1982 Falklands War appeared before a civilian appeals court
Tuesday trying to get their sentences overturned.
   However, Federal Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo asked the court
for stiffer punishment for Gen. Galtieri; Adm. Jorge Anaya, a
former navy chief, and Brig. Gen. Basilio Lami Dozo, former chief
of the armed forces.
   Galtieri, Anaya and Lami Dozo comprised the ruling junta at the
outbreak of the Falklands War. All three now are serving sentences
in military prison.
   They wore their military uniforms in court Tuesday. Although
stripped of their ranks by the military court, they were allowed to
keep the ranks pending a final ruling by the civilian appeals court.
   Moreno Ocampo also asked the court to convict three other
high-ranking officers who were absolved in May 1986 by the Armed
Forces Supreme Council, the nation's highest military tribunal.
   The trial, expected to last about three weeks, recessed Tuesday
and will resume Wednesday.
   At issue is the conduct of the 74-day war, which Argentina
initiated with an April invasion.
   Britain retook the disputed archipelago off Argentina's southern
coast in June 1982. It has claimed possession of the remote,
sparsely populated colony in the South Atlantic since 1833.
   A military inquiry later found Argentine soldiers were poorly
trained, equipped and led.
   Argentina's death toll in the Falklands War was 712, compared to
255 for Britain.
   The debacle followed the decline of Argentina's economy during
nearly eight years of military rule. It forced the army to retire
from political power and led to the election of Raul Alfonsin as
civilian president in 1983.
   The three appealed their convictions and sentences _ 12 years
for Galtieri, 14 for Anaya, eight for Lami Dozo.
   Under Argentine law, an appeal by the prosecutor is mandatory,
and the Federal Appeals Court can reconsider acquittals as well as
convictions.
   Moreno Ocampo lodged charges against three other high-ranking
officials who were among 13 acquitted by the military court _ Gens.
Mario Menendez and Omar Parada and Vice Adm. Juan Jose Lombardo.

<HEAD>Gromyko Says Relations With Britain at a Postwar High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Andrei A. Gromyko said Tuesday that
Soviet relations with Britain have reached a postwar high but that
greater cooperation between the countries is ``absolutely
essential'' to bring about disarmament.
   Gromyko's remarks came during a meeting with Sir Bryan
Cartledge, the British ambassador, who is leaving Moscow after
three years. A report on the meeting was distributed by the
official Tass news agency.
   Tass said Cartledge noted that trade and economic ties between
London and Moscow had been broadening during his stay in the Soviet
Union and relations had improved.
   ``From the point of view of the Soviet side, too, our relations
have grown richer,'' Gromyko said. ``Never before in the postwar
period have they been at such a level as now. But even this level
can and should be raised further.''
   Gromyko, who served as foreign minister for 28 years, said
differences remained between the countries, in the first place over
nuclear weapons.
   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed a three-stage
plan to scrap all nuclear arms by the year 2000. But Britain's
prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, credits the weapons with helping
deter war between East and West since the end of World War II.
   Britain, a member of NATO, has its own nuclear arms.
   ``Being realists, we do not close our eyes to existing
disagreements, first of all those concerning nuclear weapons,''
Gromyko said. ``At the same time, and this is confirmed by the
experience of our relations, Soviet-British cooperation in arms
reduction is not only possible but absolutely essential.''
   He said British support played a ``positive role'' in bringing
about the superpower treaty signed in December that bans all
medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   Cartledge arrived in Moscow as ambassador in July 1985, four
months after Gorbachev became Communist Party chief. Tass said
Cartledge said ``he was greatly impressed by the changes under way
in Soviet society, especially debureacratization'' as a part of
Gorbachev's reform drive.
   ``I like your word debureaucratization, although we don't use
it,'' the 79-year-old Gromyko answered.

   Playboy empire founder Hugh Hefner has
proposed marriage to the most recent of the chosen companions who
enjoy life with him at the Playboy Mansion, a spokesman said
Tuesday.
   Kimberley Conrad, 24, appeared in Playboy magazine this year as
``Miss January'' and is also on the cover of the current issue.
   ``Mr. Hefner has indeed popped the question Saturday night at a
romantic moment over the wishing well at the Playboy Mansion,''
said Hefner spokesman Bruce Binkow.
   No wedding date has been set, he said.
   Ms. Conrad, originally from Alabama, began her relationship with
Hefner following the magazine executive's split from his longtime
companion Carrie Leigh. Ms. Leigh earlier this year attempted to
bring a $35 million palimony action against Hefner after their
affair soured. The action has been dropped.
   Hefner, 62, married Mildred M. Williams in 1949; the couple had
two children including daughter Christie Hefner, now president of
the Playboy business empire.
   Since his divorce more than 30 years ago, Hefner has advocated
the free-swinging lifestyle that came to be known as the ``Playboy
philosophy.''

<HEAD>Sarney Warns New Constitution Could Make Brazil `Ungovernable'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney said late
Tuesday that approval of a proposed new constitution could make
Brazil ``ungovernable,'' spurring inflation and slashing economic
growth.
   ``There is no way to estimate the economic, social and political
impact of many of the articles,'' Sarney said in an address on
national television. ``If passed as it is, the charter will cause
economic and fiscal chaos and Brazilians will pay the costs.''
   The broadcast was Sarney's last-ditch attempt to remove several
proposals from the new document that will replace a 1969
constitution handed down by military generals.
   Legislators doubling as a consituent assembly have been working
on the document for 18 months and final voting on the draft began
Tuesday.
   The document includes proposal to limit annual interest rates to
12 percent, to give Brazilians control of all mining operations, to
cut the voting age from 18 to 16, and to grant the unrestricted
right to strike and a six-hour work day.
   All are clauses Sarney would like to defeat.
   He estimated the government's additional costs imposed by
clauses in the new document would be $9.5 billion. Inflation now is
23 percent monthly, the foreign debt $121 billion and unemployment
about 25 percent.
   ``I am worried the constitution could turn this country
ungovernable,'' Sarney said. ``We don't have the funds to implement
all the provisions people would be led to think were their due.''
   Sarney called a clause that would grant an amnesty to thousands
of debtors ``clearly unjust.''
   ``Many small businessmen sweated to pay their debts,'' he said.
   ``The constitution will signal the type of country we will
become,'' Sarney said. ``As the constitution stands, Brazil ...
will become a country that could have been but wasn't, a country
without a future.''
   The second round of voting is expected to last through September.
   Sarney, a 57-year-old provincial politician and poet from the
poor northeastern state of Maranhao, came to power in March 1985 as
the vice president for the popular statesman Tancredo Neves, who
died before taking office.
   They were elected in indirect electoral college voting called by
the military, which put Sarney on the Neves ticket. The vote was to
pave the way for civilian government after 21 years of military
rule.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York ended
a pilgrimage across Ireland Tuesday, saying he will ask President
Reagan to grant amnesty for Irish and other illegal aliens in the
United States.
   O'Connor said he would ask Reagan next week, ``very formally and
with as much conviction as I can muster,'' for an executive order
granting amnesty.
   ``Our society and economy could absorb a lot more (immigrants)
from Ireland, from Latin American and many other countries,'' he
said.
   The New York archbishop's six-day pilgrimage was dedicated
mainly to praying for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.
But in the Irish Republic a far more pressing concern is Irish
citizens living illegally in the United States.
   Social service agencies estimate the number of illegal Irish at
between 125,000 to 175,000, with more than two-thirds of them in
the New York area.
   Preaching at St. Mary's Cathedral in his last public Mass in
Ireland, O'Connor lamented ``the indignity of having sons and
daughters have to leave for another land because their land offers
them no opportunity.''
   Many Irish-Americans _ even those who, like O'Connor, were born
in the United States _ are familiar with the hardship of
immigration, and feel today that they are ``living almost as
exiles,'' he said.
   The Roman Catholic cardinal, a former naval chaplain who has had
close contact with the Reagan administration, told reporters after
the Mass that he hoped a presidential amnesty order would cover not
only undocumented immigrants from Ireland but ``a lot of others who
were not included in that window of opportunity.''
   He was referring to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
amnesty program, under which those who had lived and worked
continuously in the United States since 1982 could apply for legal
residency. He said illegal Irish immigrants, in particular, need an
executive order because most arrived in the United States after
1982 as Ireland's economy faltered.
   The pilgrimage took the cardinal, New York Mayor Edward I. Koch
and about 500 other people from the Shrine of Our Lady of Knock in
the wild boglands of west Ireland to St. Peter's Cathedral in the
urban battlefields of west Belfast to St. Mary's, a 613-year-old
domed temple in the midst of busy Dublin. Koch flew back to New
York on Tuesday.

   The spokesman for Ferdinand Marcos said the
former Philippine leader and his wife, Imelda, were whisked from
their mansion Tuesday after security guards said that armed men
cruised past the house.
   The Marcoses were driven to an undisclosed location, said
spokesman Gemmo Trinidad.
   A Honolulu Police Department dispatcher said the incident was
not reported on police logs. But Arturo Aruiza, another Marcos
aide, said the police department had been requested Tuesday to
assign more frequent patrols to the area.
   Trinidad said three cars drove slowly past the house at about
5:30 a.m., and around-the-clock security guards stationed at the
gate of the hillside home thought they saw guns sticking out the
car windows.
   The unarmed security guards, who were on foot, chased the cars
but could not get a good description because it was still dark,
Trinidad said. No shots were fired and no one was injured.
   The Marcoses were awakened a short time later and ``went to a
friend's house, I can't say where, but they're still on Oahu and
they'll come back as soon as it's safe,'' Trinidad said.
   Aruiza said he expected the Marcoses to be back home Wednesday.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, have lived in Honolulu's swank
Makiki Heights district since he was ousted in a popular uprising
in February 1986 that swept President Corazon Aquino to power.
   Aruiza said the Marcos household had been warned Tuesday morning
by loyalists in Manila of a rumored assassination plot.
   ``We're going to put more teeth in the security but we don't
really want to sound the alarm too much because these threats have
happened before,'' he said, adding that the Marcoses had reacted
calmly to the early morning rousting.
   ``They know it's for their safety,'' he said.
   In an interview with Philippine radio station DZXL, Trinided was
asked if he considered the alleged sighting of the men an
assassination attempt. He replied: ``Yes.''
   ``The security men saw that the occupants were all armed,'' he
said. ``They tried to accost them but they escaped.''
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return from exile in
Hawaii. In January 1987, U.S. authorities barred Marcos and his
wife from leaving Oahu island following a coup attempt in Manila by
his followers.
   The government said the attempt, which included armed attacks on
media and military facilities, was staged to pave the way for
Marcos to return.
   Just Tuesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that Marcos had
offered the Philippine government $5 billion to be allowed to
return to his homeland. In response, Marcos said that his
representatives were negotiating with the Aquino government about a
return but denied that any money was being offered.

   President Fidel Castro told Cubans Tuesday
to prepare for the return of thousands of their soldiers from
Angola if a peace agreement can be reached for that southern
African country.
   In a three-hour speech marking the 35th anniversary of the
launching of his leftist revolution, Castro also defended his
``rectification'' campaign for economic reform and said
Soviet-style reforms are not needed in Cuba. He called capitalist
economic policies ``complete trash.''
   Castro confirmed reports that Cuba recently sent reinforcements
to Angola, where it is estimated that at least 50,000 Cuban
military personnel are helping the Marxist government battle rebels
backed by South Africa and the United States.
   He said the reinforcements were needed to create proper
conditions for a political solution in Angola.
   The governments of Angola, Cuba and South Africa reached an
agreement this month for the removal of foreign troops from Angola
and independence for South-West Africa, the territory administered
by South Africa.
   The United States was represented at the talks.
   South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, lies between South
Africa and Angola
   Castro said he did not want to prejudice the continuing
negotiations on Angola by going into detail on their status, but
declared: ``We really are on the threshholds of a political
solution.''
   Portugal granted independence to Angola in 1975, and Marxist
forces defeated pro-Western groups in the civil war that followed.
   U.S. State Department sources have said Cuba sent up to 15,000
more soldiers into Angola since last fall to augment its presence
of 40,000 military personnel.
   Castro did not say how many reinforcements were sent, but said
the deployment was needed and could not be done halfway.
   ``Our objective was not a military victory but a political, just
solution to the conflict,'' he said.
   Cuban forces will remain in Angola ``until the minute'' a peace
agreement is signed, Castro added.
   He said Cuban troops returning from Angola once a peace pact is
concluded would be welcomed back ``to the battle for the
development of our country.''
   He rejected suggestions from the West that socialist countries
must adopt capitalist policies to move their societies forward.
   Castro called capitalist methods ``complete trash'' and added:
``We will not weaken the role of plans or development programs.''
   He said the same was true for Cuba's one-party Communist system
and no room existed for opposition groups.
   ``The (Communist) party is the one responsible for our country.
Here there is only one party,'' he said.
   Referring to economic and political reforms being pursued by the
Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet bloc
countries, Casto said those who urge adoption of those programs in
Cuba have ``an incorrect attitude, an ignorant attitude.''
   ``We will never forget where we are located, and it isn't in the
Black Sea, but in the Caribbean Sea,'' Castro he said. ``Not 90
miles from Odessa, but 90 miles from Miami.''
   In the past two years, Cuba has abandoned economic incentives
aimed at boosting production and implemented a campaign of ``moral
persuasion'' that emphasizes greater worker discipline.
   ``It would be totally incorrect for us to copy mechanically the
solutions of other countries,'' Castro said, and what may be best
for the Soviet bloc may not work for Cuba.
   Noting that Japan achieved its status as one of the world's most
powerful nations economically with an average of six vacation days
per worker each year, Castro called on Cubans to achieve more
during the working hours they have. He said he wasn't suggesting
taking away vacations or increasing work schedules in Cuba.
   Two years ago, Castro declared that worker absenteeism and
inefficient production threatened to make Cuba a nation of
freeloaders.
   The Cuban leader cited a lengthy list of recent industrial and
public works projects in Santiago, Cuba's second-largest city with
a population of 962,000.
   Earlier Tuesday, Cubans marked the revolution's 35th anniversary
by staging a symbolic attack on a military barracks that now is an
elementary school.
   Castro attended a ceremony in Santiago at 5 a.m., the exact time
his revolution began, and watched youth groups mount a mock assault
on the Moncada Garrison in this eastern Cuban city.
   Although the 1953 attack failed, the brutality with which it was
suppressed sparked popular support for Castro's fight to overthrow
rightist dictator Fulgencio Bastista.
   Castro was imprisoned and later released. He fled the island,
but returned with revolutionary forces aboard the yacht Granma in
1956 to start his guerrilla war in the mountains.
   The struggle ended in a triumphant march into Havana on Jan. 1,
1959, to begin Communist rule.

   Two Army commanders testified Tuesday
that they urged a private to abstain from sexual activity after he
tested positive for the AIDS virus, but they never ordered him to
abstain or warned him that his sexual conduct could be a crime.
   The commanders testified for the prosecution at the opening of
the court-martial of Pvt. Adrian G. Morris Jr., who in March 1987
became the first member of the military to be charged with
AIDS-related offenses.
   Others to testify included a soldier identified only as Jane
Doe, and Spec. 4 Patricia C. Pruitt, who was engaged to Morris for
a time. Both women said Morris told them prior to having sex that
he had a rare, incurable blood disease but did not mention AIDS.
   Morris, 28, of Caseyville, Ill., is accused of having threatened
the health of the two women and a third male soldier by failing to
use condoms during sex and by failing to warn them he had tested
positive for exposure to the AIDS virus.
   Col. Warren A. Todd, a physician who commanded the hospital at
Fort Huachuca in this southeast Arizona town, said he counseled
Morris in July 1986 after Morris tested positive to having
antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Presence of the antibodies indicates the person has been exposed
to the virus, may develop AIDS and can spread it.
   Todd said he advised Morris to use condoms if he had sex and to
avoid high-risk partners. But he said there was no order for those
testing positive to abstain from sex nor any criminal sanction for
sexual activity.
   Capt. Bernard E. Kulifay Jr. said he counseled Morris ``strictly
man-to-man'' on several occasions between July 1986 and March 1987
and advised him that ``he should not screw around.''
   Kulifay said his soldiers, including Morris, watched a film in
1986 detailing AIDS and its transmission.
   But under cross-examination, Kulifay acknowledged that the film
did not say that soldiers who tested positive for the virus but
failed to abstain from sex were committing criminal conduct.
   Both Todd and Kulifay said they never told Morris his sexual
activity might be criminal.
   Late in the afternoon, the soldier identified only as Ms. Doe
testified that she had sex twice with Morris in August 1986, the
second time the night before her husband of one month arrived in
Sierra Vista.
   She said Morris had told her ``that he had a rare blood disease
and he could die at any moment.'' She said Morris said the disease
was fatal but did not mention HIV or AIDS.
   She acknowledged under cross-examination that she was testifying
in exchange for immunity from charges of adultery, which is a
military crime. She also said Army medical officials have told her
she no longer is at risk for contracting the disease.
   The woman testified after the judge, Col. Raymond D. Cole,
reversed himself and allowed her to testify under a pseudonym,
despite defense objections. The prosecution had claimed that
identifying the woman could harm her mental health.
   Ms. Pruitt testified that Morris told her in 1986 he had ``an
incurable blood disease'' but didn't say until January 1987 that it
was AIDS. She said they had sex weekly from April to October 1986,
with Morris using a condom about one-fourth of the time.
   She said they resumed relations in Jaunary 1987, even though she
knew Morris' test results and that AIDS is ``an incurable,
contagious, fatal disease.'' She said she understood the risk.
   The soldier also said she and her child _ born last year and
allegedly fathered by Morris _ have tested negative for HIV.
   Morris has pleaded innocent to three counts of aggravated
assault, three counts of conduct bringing discredit upon the Army
and one count of sodomy. He faces up to 17 years in prison,
dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances if
convicted.
   When he was charged, Morris was the first member of the military
to face AIDS-related charges. Other cases have been brought since.
   In April, the Army adopted regulations requiring commanders to
warn soldiers testing positive for the AIDS virus that they face
discharge or prosecution if they don't tell sex partners about
their condition or use condoms. The Air Force and Navy have adopted
similar regulations.

<DATELINE>MEEKER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automobile innovator Malcolm Bricklin is
seeking to evict a business associate from his northwestern
Colorado ranch in a lawsuit that has brought bitter allegations
from both sides.
   A jury trial in the Combined Courts of Rio Blanco County is
scheduled to begin Wednesday in the civil suit brought by Bricklin
Industries Inc. against John Avery.
   Bricklin, 49, wants to remove Avery, his wife and three children
from a refurbished home on a ranch Bricklin owns nine miles south
of here and about 225 miles west of Denver.
   Earlier this year, several small businesses filed liens of more
than $100,000 against Bricklin-owned property in Colorado. Bricklin
paid off his debts by early May, however, after he received the
proceeds from the sale of his stake in Global Motors Inc.
   Global was the parent of Yugo America Inc., which introduced the
cut-priced Yugo automobile to the United States in 1985. But
Bricklin is best known for his failed attempt in the 1970s to
popularize a plastic, gull-wing sports car bearing his name.
   In the latest dispute, he contends that Avery, 38, is not doing
the job he was hired for. The millionaire had paid Avery $8,000 a
month to act as ranch manager and also paid him as a real estate
consultant.
   His suit follows a lawsuit filed by Avery earlier this year in
federal court. Avery's suit contends that Bricklin has not lived up
to terms of a verbal agreement under which Avery was allowed to buy
500 acres of Bricklin's 8,000-acre Franklin Ranch and invest
$40,000 in a ranch house on the property.
   Bricklin says the agreements covered only rental of the property.
   Joseph Coleman, Avery's lawyer, said Bricklin cut off payments
to his client and sought to get out of the verbal agreement in
August 1987.
   ``When John filed a lawsuit, Bricklin responded by trying to
take his home away,'' he said Tuesday.
   In an interview in the Rocky Mountain News on Tuesday, Bricklin
said: ``People can't do the job, then they turn around and ask you
for more money. It's something that wouldn't be happening if it
wasn't me, because I've got some money. And if it wasn't me, it
wouldn't be news.''
   However, Coleman said bank accounts for the initial land
purchase bear both men's names, indicating a partnership existed
and supporting the verbal agreement.

<HEAD>Salvage Crane Raises Vessel; Officials Find 10 More Bodies</HEAD>

   A salvage crane working in pre-dawn darkness
Wednesday raised the battered hulk of a fishing boat that sank
after a collision with a Japanese submarine, and officials found
the bodies of 10 more victims.
   That brought the confirmed death toll in Saturday's disaster to
19. Eleven people from the Fujimaru were missing and presumed dead
and 18 were rescued.
   Coast guard ships brought families of the victims to within a
few yards of where a giant crane pulled up the 154-ton charter
fishing boat. The operation was broadcast live on national
television.
   Authorities were to continue the search for bodies Wednesday.
   News reports meanwhile suggested the captain of the Maritime
Self-Defense Force submarine Nadashio may have erred just before
the collision in Tokyo Bay.
   The 2,200-ton submarine Nadashio collided head-on with the
Fujimaru while the naval vessel crossed a busy shipping lane near
the entrance of Tokyo Bay.
   Kyodo News Service, NHK Radio and television reports quoted the
ship's surviving crew as saying the Nadashio sounded its horn to
warn the vessel out of its path, instead of turning to avoid a
collision.
   The Fujimaru sank within two minutes. The submarine reported no
injuries among its 75 crew.
   ``As captain of the ship, I did my best ... to avoid a
collision,'' Manji Kondo, the 30-year-old captain of the Fujimaru,
told a televised news conference Tuesday night.
   ``It happened too fast for us to try to rescue passengers left
inside. For a captain of a ship it is the greatest blow to the
heart.''
   The disaster prompted speculation among Japan's press that
Defense Agency chief Tsutomu Kawara would resign to take
responsibility.
   But at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita charged Kawara with concluding the salvage operation and
accounting for all the victims.
   Kawara and other defense officials faced criticism from
survivors, relatives of victims and news commentators about the
Nadashio's 21-minute delay in notifying the coast guard of the
accident.
   People thrown from the ship sank out of sight as crewmen atop
the submarine watched, reports said. One survivor told journalists
crewmen stared back as she waved and yelled at them, ``Why won't
you help?''
   Of the 19 people plucked from the water, 16 were rescued by a
passing yacht and a tanker and only three by the submarine. One of
those rescued later died.

   At least half the thousands of operations
on Americans with ruptured discs in their lower back probably were
unnecessary, says a study showing 90 percent of such patients can
be healed without surgery.
   The three-year study indicates that surgeons should change how
they decide whether to operate on patients with lumbar disc
problems, one of the study's authors, Dr. Jeffrey Saal of the San
Francisco Spine Institute, said Monday.
   Neurosurgeons often operate if a patient fails to improve after
bed rest and suffers severe pain, leg weakness and if diagnostic
exams show the disc's nucleus has broken through the disc wall and
is pressing against a nerve root.
   Saal said none of those criteria should be used as overwhelming
evidence that surgery is needed. He said the decision should be
based on the patients' level of function and whether that can be
improved by an aggressive rehabilitation program.

has produced ``the worst habitat conditions'' biologists have ever

   Reduced hunting is one suggestion that advisory committees are

hearings early next month on guidelines for states to use in
adopting actual hunting regulations.
   Also put up for discussion, spokeswoman Megan Durham said
Monday, are a three-bird bag limit _ the typical recent limit has

   Some were moaning. Others just watched fearfully as nurses
adjusted hand straps, checked sodium chloride drips, consoled

   The 23 children at Teg Bahadur Hospital are the latest stricken

is spreading to new areas of the Indian capital.
   The city adminstration reported 13 more deaths from the diseases
Monday, bringing the death toll to 143 since the epidemic broke out
in early July. At least 78 others have died in nearby Punjab and
Uttar Pradesh states.
   The Delhi administration ordered an emergency inoculation
program to halt the diseases, which spread as contaminated

   The Navy is studying why the promotion of
blacks in its ranks lags behind that of the other services, 40
years after President Harry S. Truman ordered the nation's military
to integrate.
   The Navy has launched an intensive two-month study to report to
Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Carlisle Trost on why the service
has so few black officers and why so many blacks are subject to
disciplinary action.
   The study was initiated at the suggestion of Vice Admiral L.A.
Edney, chief of naval personnel.
   ``Progress has slowed. We need to find out why,'' Edney said at
a convention of the mostly black Naval Officers' Association
earlier this month in Atlanta.
   The review coincides with the 40th anniversary today of Truman's
Executive Order 9981 for ``equality of treatment and opportunity
for all persons in the armed forces without regard to race, color,
religion or national origin.''

   Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,
goes the saying, and in the TV business, imitators are the best
assurance your show is a success.
   ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' has spawned another
syndicated Paramount science fiction remake series for the fall,
``War of the Worlds.''
   ``Friday the 13th,'' the scary syndicated series based on a long
string of hit theatrical movies has prompted Lorimar to come up
with the series ``A Nightmare on Elm Street: Freddy's Nightmares.''
   Even ``Double Dare,'' the kids' game show, has a competitor,
``Fun House,'' though its producers insist they had sold the show
before Nickelodeon's ``Double Dare'' became a success in
syndication.
   The 5-month-old Writers Guild strike has affected syndicated
series just as much as the networks' shows.
   Producers of hour-long shows, like ``Star Trek,'' which is on
hold until the strike ends, predicted they couldn't get on the air
with new episodes until October or November.
   ``Nightmare'' has about eight completed scripts and plans to
premiere on schedule the first week of October. ``War of the
Worlds'' will also premiere that week and has ``enough scripts to
fulfill our obligation if the strike goes on for a long, long
time,'' said Stephen Nalevansky, vice president of creative affairs
at Paramount Television. He said the scripts, from ``various
sources,'' would not be used once the show's striking writers
returned. The show is being produced in Toronto. Nalevansky
wouldn't say how many scripts the producers have in hand.
   As a tribute to the success of ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation,'' which is the highest-rated weekly show in
syndication, ``War of the Worlds'' has already been sold in 190
markets covering 97 percent of the country.
   The show premieres in the 50th anniversary year of the original
Orson Welles ``War of the Worlds'' radio show, and the 35th
anniversary year of the Oscar-winning movie of the same name.
   The premise is that the aliens who invaded the Earth in 1953 and
were killed by a mysterious bacteria are reviving because of
radiation in the environment. A band of scientists, aided by a
soldier, struggles to alert a populace left with amnesia from their
original encounter with the aliens.
   ``Freddy's Nightmares'' is set in a small town where the spirit
of violent Freddy terrorizes the townspeople who destroyed him.
   ``It's a show designed not to let its audience get to bed
peacefully right after it's over,'' said executive producer Robert
Shaye. He said for television, the producers would have to tone
down the massive special effects of the movie version and rely more
on suspense and the suggestion of violence.
   Also on tap for the fall in syndication is another
``reality-based'' show, ``Family Medical Center'' from Lorimar. The
half-hour drama will, says executive producer Jay Feldman, ``touch
you and move you, but will also give you medical information.''
   The show's medical advisor is Dr. Walter Dishell, who has served
as advisor to the network hospital shows ``Medical Center,''
``M-A-S-H'' and ``Trapper John, M.D.''
   Dishell said the shows would tackle such subjects as breast
cancer, showing that there are optional treatments the patient can
select, and the touchy subject of abortion. Shaye said the
producers plan to offer both sides of controversial issues.
   ``Family Medical Center'' premieres Sept. 12.
   Dishell, incidentally, counts ``M-A-S-H'' as the best medical
show ever.
   ``I don't think anything will ever touch that,'' he said, though
he added, ```St. Elsewhere' is a good show.''

   Elsewhere in Television:
   LIVING ROOM ``WHEEL'' _ Mattel Toys is coming out with an
interactive home version of ``Wheel of Fortune.'' For a mere $75,
suggested retail, viewers can play along using a small computerized
game that loads the puzzle on TV by way of a coded signal, similar
to close captioning. The only difference, says Mattel spokeswoman
Kaaren Lee Brown: ``You don't get to meet Vanna, and you don't win
cash or prizes.''
   GET RID OF THE AIR FILTER, GEORDI _ LeVar Burton, one of the
stars of ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' says he has asked the
producers to allow his blind character, Geordi La Forge, to somehow
in the future miraculously lose the odd device that he wears over
his eyes to help him ``see.'' But Burton, who counts his expressive
eyes as one of his biggest assets as an actor, says the experience
of doing without has helped him become ``a better actor.'' He told
a meeting of TV critics: ``It forced me to develop other ways to
express myself.'' Still, it seems, enough is enough. ``Get that air
filter off of him,'' recommended co-star Jonathan Frakes. ``Star
Trek: The Next Generation'' is on hold until the writers' strike is
over, but co-executive producer Rick Berman said they would not
resort to re-shooting old scripts of the 1960s version of the show.
``To take a script that would have Mr. Spock and Capt. Kirk and put
it in to some semblance of order that we could do would require the
kind of writing we're not allowed to do (under the terms of the
Writers Guild strike),'' said Berman.

<HEAD>You Must Run Yourself as a Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of your smartest, best educated friends
never catch on to the rules of the game, says Allen Cymrot. ``They
live in a capitalist society, but they never learn to live as
capitalists.''
   Instead, he states, they live under constant financial stress,
forever frustrated by their inability to improve the quality of
their lives. And all because they do not know the name or rules of
the game.
   ``When you're on the football field you play football,'' says
Cymrot. ``And in a capitalist society you should seek to live like
a capitalist.''
   In his view, you should consider yourself a business, with a
balance sheet and profit-loss statement. You must understand net
worth, because it is that, rather than current income, he contends,
that raises the quality of life.
   Cymrot learned the lessons a long time ago, practiced them as an
executive responsible for buying and selling more than $1 billion
worth of property, and now, as a labor of love, wants to teach the
lessons.
   He has written a book, ``every evening at home for a year on a
yellow pad or personal computer,'' to help preach his philosophy
that ``a person is as responsible for personal wealth as surely as
for personal health.''
   He calls it ``Street Smart Real Estate Investing,'' but it is
more than that. It is a strategy for increasing net worth and the
key to a high quality material life, a message that sounds simple
but is forever overlooked.
   Because he is a real estate person, he uses real estate to
illustrate his concept _ that the mass of people live lives of
quiet desperation because they try to finance everything on current
income rather than business investments.
   No matter how well educated, Cymrot laments, people make the
mistake. But, he says, 99 percent of the academic curricula that
tell how to make money offer nothing on what to do with it.''
   And what do most people do with it? They use it, but never
really invest it.
   ``They live like socialists in a capitalist country. They don't
know how to generate net worth, so when they run into trouble, when
they seek to raise the quality of their lives, they want government
to legislate wealth for them.''
   The theme of Cymrot's book, published by Dow Jones Irwin, is
this:
   You must develop a profit and loss statement. Any excess
earnings from the P&L statement should go into good investments.
Those investments move tangible assets to your balance sheet. As
these investments grow, net worth increases.
   When you seek to buy a home, a car, a boat or finance your
child's education, the money comes from your balance sheet _ your
net worth _ not from your current earnings.
   ``These expenditures are financed by the strength of your
balance sheet. Your income may make the monthly payments, but your
balance sheet provides funds for the down payment,'' he says.
   He stresses the idea in the book: ``Income buys daily
necessities and little frills; ASSETS BUY OTHER ASSETS.''
   Cymrot knows his subject, and practices it. He is chairman and
director of the National Multi-Housing Council, and former
president and director of Robert A. McNeil Corp., one of the
country's largest real estate entities.
   Now chief executive officer of Woodmont Realty Advisors Inc. of
Belmont, Calif., a company that invests in properties for pension
funds, he continues to build his personal net worth through outside
investment activities.
   It is from experiences with both individual and executive
investing that he draws the material for his book. But the concept
does not depend on real estate, although Cymrot believes it is a
superior vehicle. Any good investment will do.
   In his meetings with investors and students _ he lectures
frequently to graduate students _ he says he has found all human
beings have some aspect of success _ in business, social life or
through charitable involvements.
   ``But the vast majority of people haven't carried that success
into their investment life,'' he says in the book. ``There seems to
be a bridge that is missing.''
   He hopes this book can be that bridge, ``connecting those
principles that reflect your success in other aspects of your life
with the investment side of your life.''

<HEAD>NEW YORK: for him.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Who says ``no'' now?
   ``No one,'' Rivers replies quietly. ``Nobody wants to rock a
boat. Gene Saks was wonderful and gave me a lot of encouragement,
but you're really on your own out there.''
   If she faces the audience alone, some of them don't recognize
her when she first walks on stage, a slightly stooped woman wearing
no makeup and a faded housedress.
   ``There's a lot of my mother in Kate Jerome, in her strength,''
the Brooklyn-born Rivers says. ``And my father's patients,
particularly in her expressions. He was a doctor who had a large
Jewish medical practice.''
   Rivers began rehearsals for the show at the end of May.
   ``At my age, it's hard memorizing a script,'' she laughs. ``I
asked everybody for advice. Somebody told me it takes Alec Guinness
a year to memorize a script. He apparently types the whole thing
out. Roddy McDowell says he records it and listens on a Walkman.''
   While she was working in Las Vegas, Rivers hired an unemployed
actor and actress who fed her lines constantly when she wasn't on
stage in a club.
   Her 20-year-old daughter, Melissa, who wants to be an actress,
came opening night and told her, ``Mother, I hope my opening nights
are as good as yours.''
   Melissa, now a college student, calls every night, phoning her
mother in her dressing room at the Broadhurst Theater.
   In August, while starring in ``Broadway Bound,'' Rivers will
work after the show at Michael's Pub, an East Side nightclub.
She'll try out new material, much like she does when she's in
California at Carlos 'n' Charlie's, another small nightspot.
   Rivers has never been shy about going after a job.
   ``Nothing has ever fallen in my lap,'' she says. ``I've always
had to go out and get it. When you're a working performer, you're a
gun for hire. You do what comes along.''
   To reach her mass audience, Rivers still has that center square
on television's ``Hollywood Squares,'' the never-ending game show
she tapes when she has the time.
   ``I love playing the game, and I like the exposure,'' she says.
``There is no other exposure for me at the moment. I'm persona non
grata at Carson and also at Letterman because Letterman is a Carson
production.''
   She says she would go back to ``Tonight,'' where she reigned as
Johnny Carson's leading substitute host until becoming his rival on
the Fox network.
   ``He doesn't want any part of me,'' Rivers says. ``He's angry
because I dared to leave and take my own show after my contract was
up. I did nothing wrong.''
   Rivers is selling her home in California and is buying a smaller
house there, but she's also purchased an apartment in New York.
   ``When you're single, it's the only place to be,'' she says.
``In California, you sit behind a big gate and it's home
entertaining. I need friends at this point in my life who say
`Let's go to the movies and get a bite afterward.'''
   Will she ever take the talk show road again? Rivers is not sure.
   ``The Fox thing was a nightmare,'' she recalls. ``The nightmare
was that I was fired for bad ratings. Now when you look back, the
ratings were incredible. They never got near our ratings again. The
tragedy was that the show wasn't given a chance. It takes a year to
build an audience.''
   Still, the thought of another try at a talk show persists.
   ``I look at people on talk shows and I think `Oh, no. Don't ask
that question. Ask this question,''' Rivers says. ``So obviously
it's still very much a part of my lifestyle. But there are enough
talk shows on television now. Let's all just wait, and then we'll
try again.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar, reflecting its recent strength
overseas, gained slightly in Tokyo today while stock prices
rebounded in slow trading.
   The dollar opened at 132.25 yen and rose to 132.60 before edging
down to close at 132.15, up 0.35 yen from Monday's close.
   ``Although there is no energy in the market that could keep
carrying the dollar higher, the dollar seems to be receiving enough
support to keep itself above the 132-yen level, at least for the
time being,'' a trader at the Bank of Tokyo said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which shed 117 points Monday, gained 120.23 points
or 0.44 percent to close at 27,303.76 in thin trading.
   ``It appears the market is going to hold back until the U.S. GNP
figures,'' said one dealer.
   Investors on the stock market were taking a wait-and-see
attitude ahead of Wednesday's scheduled announcement in Washington
of second-quarter figures for the gross national product, the total
retail value of goods and services produced by the country's
economy in a given period.
   ``If the U.S. GNP number is too strong, people are concerned
about inflation in the United States,'' said Hisamichi Sawa of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

   Stock prices rose Tuesday in thin trading as
players awaited Wednesday's British trade report for June.
   Dealers said there was a lack of substantive news on which to
trade following Monday's featureless session.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was 9.5
points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 1,848.0 at midday. Volume was an
extremely light 177.5 million shares, compared with 169.1 million
shares at the same time Monday.
   Without major corporate news to affect equities, players chose
to focus their attention on Wednesday's scheduled release of
British trade figures for June.
   Economists said they expect Britain's current account deficit to
have narrowed to about 800 million pounds, or $1.38 billion, in
June from 1.2 billion pounds in May and the merchandise trade
deficit to have narrowed to about 1.3 billion pounds from 1.7
billion pounds.

<HEAD>Prime Withdraws Mini-Supercomputer From Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATICK, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. is withdrawing its
MXCL5 mini-supercomputer from the marketplace and taking a $5
million charge against its second-quarter earnings.
   The company also said Monday it is canceling a marketing
agreement with Cydrome Inc. of Milpitas, Calif., which manufactured
the computer.
   Prime attributed the withdrawal of the MXCL5 to slower growth in
the mini-supercomputer field and aggressive pricing by the
company's competitors.
   ``Because of the intensely competitive pricing environment, we
determined that sales of this product would not contribute
significantly to the overall profitability of Prime,'' Prime
President Joe M. Henson said in a prepared statement.
   Henson said Prime would continue to evaluate the special-purpose
processor market, which Prime entered in January in an attempt to
compete with field leaders Alliant Computer Systems Corp. of Acton
and Convex Computer Corp. of Richardson, Texas.
   Company officials said the second-quarter earnings reduction
would amount to about 10 cents a share. Analysts had forecast
earnings of about 23 cents to 27 cents a share. Prime is to
announce quarterly earnings Thursday.
   The base price for the standard MXCL5 system was $579,000, while
a more fully configured model was price at $774,000. The Unix-based
system was designed for sophisticated engineering and scientific
number-crunching.
   Prime announced in May it was laying off about 700 employees
because of job redundancies and attrition after a February merger
with Computervision Inc. The merger moved Prime to second in the
computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing market
behind International Business Machines Corp.
   The company reported first quarter net income of $14.5 million
of revenues of $363.7 million, including Computervision operations.

<HEAD>Report Says Feds Probing Drexel-Boesky Tax Connection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has uncovered evidence that shows
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. may have aided former stock speculator
Ivan F. Boesky in an alleged scheme to violate tax laws, a report
published Tuesday said.
   The Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources familiar with
the investigation, said the government is focusing on a series of
tax-motivated stock trades three years ago between the investment
banking firm and Boesky's Seemala Corp.
   The newspaper said investigators are examining evidence
suggesting Boesky was permitted to buy and sell stock with Drexel
to claim immediate trading losses for Seemala for tax purposes, and
that Drexel later reimbursed the company for the losses.
   Drexel spokesman Steven S. Anreder said Tuesday the company
would not ``respond to stories based on rumor or leaks. We know of
no wrongdoing by our firm or any of our people. That remains our
position.''
   Since Boesky was charged in the nation's largest insider-trading
case two years ago, Drexel, along with its junk bond operations,
has emerged as the largest target of an ongoing federal
securities-fraud investigation.
   Drexel has yet to be formally charged, but it has been the
subject of numerous press reports. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has recommended civil charges of securities-law
violations against the firm and some key employees.
   The Journal article, however, suggests the case against Drexel
may be expanding to include questions of possible tax-law
violations.
   The Internal Revenue Service, along with the SEC and the U.S.
Attorney's office in Manhattan, which reportedly are conducting a
criminal investigation of Drexel, are probing the alleged tax
scheme, according to the newspaper.
   Boesky agreed in November 1986 to pay a record $100 million to
settle insider-trading charges and was sentenced last December to
three years imprisonment on a single felony count of conspiring to
lie to the SEC.

<HEAD>Dalkon Shield Maker's Reorganization Confirmed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today confirmed A.H. Robins
Co.'s Chapter 11 reorganization plan, including $2.475 billion to
compensate women injured by the Dalkon Shield birth control device.
   The order entered by U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr.
will become final if no appeals are filed by Aug. 25. However,
Merhige and attorneys in the case have said previously such appeals
were likely.
   The reorganization of Robins, a Richmond-based pharmaceutical
manufacturer, includes the company's merger with New York-based
American Home Products Corp. in a $700 million exchange of stock.
   At a hearing last week, attorneys for Robins said more than 94
percent of Dalkon Shield claimants who cast ballots on the
reorganization plan voted for acceptance. Almost 72 percent of the
195,000 claimants returned ballots.
   Robins stockholders approved the reorganization plan by more
than a 99 percent vote.
   If any appeals are filed, payment of larger claims for Dalkon
Shield injuries would be delayed. However, the company will place
$100 million in the Dalkon Shield trust fund to pay smaller claims
pending resolution of appeals.
   Robins filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in August
1985 as lawsuits mounted against the birth control device, which
the company marketed in the early 1970s.

York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 399 up, 430 down and 506
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.40 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said many investors were avoiding making big
commitments in advance of the Commerce Department's report due out
Wednesday on the gross national product for the second quarter of
the year.
   Private estimates generally call for inflation-adjusted GNP
growth to come in at about the same 3.6 percent annual rate
reported for the first quarter.
   Anything much higher than that might intensify worries about
inflation and higher interest rates, brokers said.
   Today the government said new factory orders for durable goods
jumped 8.8 percent in June. However, brokers said the figure wasn't
regarded as conclusive, because most of the increase came in
military goods, a category that is often subject to wide
month-by-month fluctuations.
   Microsoft fell 3 to 57{ in over-the-counter trading. The company
reported higher quarterly profits, but the results evidently fell
short of many investors' expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.14 to 149.88. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .16 at 304.84.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 10.84 to
2,071.83.
   But declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE,
with 676 up, 752 down and 503 unchanged. Big Board volume came to
215.14 million shares, against 148.88 million in the previous
session.

<HEAD>Western European Car Industry Is Booming, Alas</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Western European car industry, the world's
largest, is enjoying record sales as consumers from Britain to
Italy flock to showrooms eager to buy ``new wheels.''
   While this is undoubtedly good news, some industry people,
believe it or not, find it distinctly worrying.
   The reason is that the boom has attracted more competitors in
what already is a fiercely competitive market. That has heightened
fears that the field will become overcrowded, leaving the car
makers vulnerable in a downturn, which could come as soon as next
year.
   ``The market is booming,'' said Sanjay Dabysing, head of the
automotive group at DRI Europe Ltd., a private economic forecasting
firm in London.
   Sales, which have been buoyant in Europe since the mid-1980s,
are expected to grow to a record 12.5 million cars this year from
12.4 million in 1987, DRI said.
   In comparison, 11.3 million cars were sold in North America and
3.3 million in Japan in the most recent year.
   ``It's a representation of the reasonably good economic growth
in Europe in recent years,'' said Garel Rhys, an automotive
economist at the University of Cardiff.
   The sales growth stems from strong consumer spending created by
income growth, tax cuts and an increasing willingness among
Europeans to take on debt, the experts said. In addition, more
businesses are using company cars, they said.
   Britain, Spain and Italy have been experiencing particularly
strong demand, while sales have been slowed somewhat in West
Germany by a sluggish economy.
   Import restraints and the overall buoyancy of the market have
encouraged Japanese manufacturers to build more plants in Europe.
The market also has attracted other Asian and Eastern European
competitors, like the makers of South Korea's Hyundai and
Yugoslavia's inexpensive Yugo.
   U.S. automakers have stepped up their activity by buying up
European luxury car makers. General Motors Corp. has bought Lotus
Group of Cos.; Chrysler Corp. has bought Automobili Lamborghini SpA
and Ford Motor Co., which already owns Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd.,
is rumored to be interested in Jaguar PLC.
   ``The market has become more competitive,'' Dabysing said.
   Most of the competition still comes from other Europeans. Unlike
the United States, where the Big Three automakers control the
market, Europe has a large number of domestically based
manufacturers.
   The top six auto makers and their market shares in 1987,
according to DRI, were: Volkswagen AG, 14.9 percent; Fiat Auto SpA,
14.2 percent; the combination of Peugeot S.A. and Automobiles
Citroen S.A., 12.2 percent; Ford, 12 percent; Renault S.A., 10.6
percent, and General Motors, 10.6 percent.
   The biggest rivalry among the Europeans is between Volkswagen
and Fiat, both of which are trying to expand their markets across
the continent in anticipation of the Common Market's elimination of
most trade barriers in 1992.
   Fiat, for instance, makes 60 percent of its sales in Italy, but
expects to face new threats at home once trade restrictions on
imports are lifted across the European Economic Community.
   The Japanese, meanwhile, have already captured 11.4 percent of
the European market, mostly through imports, DRI said.
   ``The Japanese are now moving on to the next stage as they have
in America, trying to diffuse the controversy that their sales have
created in Europe,'' Rhys said.
   The pioneer, Nissan Motor Co., operates a plant in Sunderland,
England, and has already doubled its planned 1992 capacity to
200,000 cars.
   ``There is no doubt that manufacturers like Toyota (Motor Corp.)
and Mazda (Motor Corp.) and Mitsubishi (Motors Corp.) will follow
this route. Where and when is difficult to answer, but they will be
coming,'' Dabysing said, adding that the Japanese might also bring
over cars it makes in North America.
   Indeed, John Grant, vice president for business strategy for
Ford of Europe Inc. in Brentwood, England, said that's ``the
biggest worry we have.''
   The Japanese companies, already the most productive car makers,
will be able to cut costs further when they set up more operations
in Europe, which will save them considerable transportation costs.
   ``We will get an excess capacity situation again, which will
increase the cost pressures on everybody and will increase the
competitive pressures,'' Grant said.
   The market could develop an excess capacity of 1 million cars,
he estimated.
   The 12-nation EEC has yet to decide whether it will restrict
Japanese imports after 1992, when it becomes a barrier-free
marketplace. The experts are expecting the EEC to choose a
voluntary quota on Japanese car sales, perhaps limiting them to 10
percent of the market.
   ``Some people argue that there are too many independent
manufacturers in Europe,'' Rhys said.``If the market turned off
considerably in the future, the firms would find it difficult to
make profits and the question would be, how do the firms survive?''
   The companies have toughened up by striving to become more
productive and to produce higher quality cars, in an effort to
close those gaps with the Japanese leaders.
   Western European makers have also joined forces, either through
mergers or through joint ventures to produce various components,
and in one case, an entire car. Renault and Volksagen are working
together on an automatic gear box; Peugeot, Volvo A.B. and Renault
are working on an engine; Rover Group PLC and Honda Motor Co.
developed a car together, the Rover 800 also called the Honda
Legend.
   This has helped the Western European makers _ which do not enjoy
the economies of scale the Americans have _ to become more
profitable.
   Although the drop in the dollar has hurt luxury car makers who
export to the United States, Dabysing said that in 1987, ``they
(the major European car makers) made money on the operations level
for the first time in a long, long time and 1988 is proving to be a
good year, too.''
   The cloud on the horizon is the setback the industry is
expecting in 1989. The experts are forcasting sales of 11.5 million
cars to 11.75 million cars, a decline of as much as 8 percent.
   But the competitors won't be put off, the experts said.
   ``It's entrepreneurship. Hope springs eternal in the human
breast,'' Rhys said. ``Everybody feels they can make a lot of
money. It's a very big market and they want to be in it and they
want to be in it in a bigger way in the future.''

<HEAD>German Automakers Try Incentives To Lure U.S. Buyers</HEAD>

   Buffeted by a cheaper dollar and Japanese
competition, European carmakers are hoping to hold on to their
lucrative slice of the American market. Two of them are trying new
incentives to keep Americans buying.
   At present, the Europeans have a 5.1 percent share of the
American mmarket, compared to 18.6 percent for the Japanese.
   ``Fly to Europe on Mercedes-Benz,'' says a newspaper
advertisement of the West German automaker. The company offers a
single business-class seat or two coach-class seats to anybody who
orders a Mercedes in the United States.
   It is the first time American buyers have been offered a free
trip to pick up the prestige autos at the factory in Stuttgart.
   ``We offer them a luncheon and, if they want, a factory tour,''
said Fred Chapman, spokesman of Mercedes-Benz North America in
Montvale, N.J.
   Since the beginning of the advertising campaign earlier this
year, about 700 Americans have accepted the offer, Chapman said.
   With factory deliveries, buyers save $3,500 for the lower-priced
Mercedes to almost $10,000 for the luxury model, Chapman added.
   After the buyer completes his European vacation, the company
arranges to ship the car without charge to the U.S. dealer who
handles customs arrangements and other paperwork.
   For Mercedes-Benz cars delivered new in the United States,
prices range from $29,190 for the 190E model with manual
transmission to $77,065 for the 560 SEC.
   Last year, 89,000 Mercedes were sold on the American market. In
the first six months of 1988, sales were steady at 44,066.
   Porsche, the West German builder of sports cars, lost some
business this year mostly because of the weak dollar. ``That made
our cars more expensive and less affordable,'' said Martha Mckinley
from the company's U.S. headquarters in Reno, Nevada.
   Porsche sold 12,824 cars in the first six months of 1987, but
sales declined to 8,807 in the same period of this year.
   The company is now trying to recapture some ground with an
incentive program. The company's Trust-Tourist Delivery program
offers discounts between 7 and 10 percent, depending on the model,
for all models ordered in the United States and picked up in West
Germany.
   Prices range from $26,560 for the Porsche 924 to $69,380 for the
Porsche 928.
   The company sees its main competition from Japanese cars and
from its German rival.
   ``In the lower-priced cars it's the Japanese product. When it
comes to the expensive models, we have to fight Mercedes,'' she
said.
   The Italian auto giant Fiat, which sells Alfa Romeos and Lancia
cars on the American market, has similar fears. The company took
its own Fiat models off the market because of the Japanese
competition in the small-car area. Gualberto Ramieri, a Fiat
spokesman, expects that the new Alfa Romeo 164 will capture some
lost ground in America.
   The price for the car on the American market has not been fixed
yet, he added.
   In the first six months of 1988, Fiat sold 2,708 Alfa Romeos in
the United States, down from 3,422 in the same period last year.
For the whole 1988, Ramieri expects the sale of about 6,000 cars
through the company's 150 dealers across the United States.
   France's Peugeot also lost some ground in the United States. It
sold 9,320 cars last year but only 3,454 cars in the first half of
1988. Spokeswoman Kim Derderian said the company hopes a new model,
the Peugeot 405, will recapture some buyers.
   The British luxury car maker Jaguar doesn't fear sales losses.
The car with a basic price of $45,000 finds most of its admirers in
California, Florida and the bigger cities, according to company
spokesman Tom McDonald. Last year the company sold 10,028 of its
cars in the United States. McDonald expects no major changes for
this year.
   BMW, another German luxury carmaker, has no plans to offer
special incentives to U.S. buyers.
   ``We know about the free trips Mercedes offers but we have no
similar program,'' said Robert Mitchell from BMW North America. His
company sold 87,839 cars last year on the American market. Mitchell
expects the same result for this year.

<TEXT>
   At age 65, Wayne Green's calling came long
before his landslide victory in the non-binding Republican vice
presidential race in New Hampshire's earliest-in-the-nation primary.
   He is a publisher, not a politician, and while his brief
campaign gave him a chance to speak out on everything from
education to electronics, he won't be at the side of George Bush
this fall.
   It's questionable whether he could carry his own towns of
Peterborough and Hancock.
   Though he made Peterborough, N.H. _ population 4,876 _ a major
publishing center by pioneering such successful magazines as
Digital Audio and Byte, residents like to say he also has fired
half the town.
   A few years ago, a Wayne Green ex-employees association sprang
up, and about 50 people showed up for a dinner to swap anecdotes.
Even Green attended.
   Green has had his problems elsewhere, too. He's been sued by the
IRS, CBS, the telephone company and his former wife.
   At 65, he seems to make a lasting impression _ positive or
negative _ on almost everyone he meets.
   His message, ballyhooed on the editorial pages of his
publications, is simple: ``I get great satisfaction out of
encouraging people to make money, to be successful,'' he said.
   And he is generally respected, even among those he has rankled,
as a man of considerable vision in the computer field.
   ``He foresaw the future of computers in the early 1970s and ran
articles on the application of computers,'' said one former Green
executive, who asked that his name not be used.
   ``In the early 1980s, he started a magazine on compact disks. He
was two years ahead of the others.''
   He played a role in the growth of fledgling industries such as
microcomputers, compact disks and the repeater relay business for
ham operators by giving manufacturers a place to advertise and
hungry consumers a place to learn about the new products.
   Green said he has started 25 magazines, many of them still being
published. After selling out to International Data Group, one of
the largest computer magazine publishers in the world, for a
reported $16 million several years ago, he started another
publishing house, Wayne Green Enterprises in Hancock, which he
claims is worth $20 million.
   He writes industry newsletters, biannually publishes a yearbook
on compact disks, puts together foreign travel tours for ham
operators, has written a $100 video for businesses to teach proper
public relations and is thinking about producing classical music
tapes.
   His second wife, Sherry, meanwhile, has produced 22 dance videos
that are ``selling like crazy,'' he said.
   He has mingled with King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi of India, fellow ham radio operators, and said he has
convinced Hussein to introduce ham radio in schools to get
youngsters interested in electronics. Another goal is to sell
electronics magazines to students in China.
   ``Oddly, widely connected,'' the anonymous executive called him.
   Green is a founding member of Mensa, an organization of people
who score in the top 2 percent of intelligent tests _ a man of a
thousand ideas and a solution to every problem. His vice
presidential campaign gave him a chance to air his thoughts on how
to improve the quality of education, increase the number of
electronic experts in the country, solve the drug abuse problem and
get people off welfare.
   Strangely, many of these opinions have found ample display on
the pages of his technology publications, which he churns out from
an 18-room farmhouse.
   ``As long as I can remember, he was always pushing, pushing
people to get out and be creative and to use their talents to get
ahead in the world,'' said another former employee, Jeff DeTray of
Troy, N.H.
   ``He's happiest when new things are starting up and growth is
taking place,'' DeTray said. ``He seemed less happy when new
projects become routine.''
   Life has been far from routine for Green since he left New York
City 27 years ago. Two years earlier, he had been fired as an
editor of a ham radio magazine, so he started his own, called 73.
   ``I sold everything I had, my 22-foot Chris-Craft for $1,500, my
plane for $2,000 and my Porsche for $3,500, enough money to print
my first issue,'' he said.
   He moved to Peterborough in his native New Hampshire _ he was
born in Littleton _ because of the town's proximity to the
2,280-foot Pack Monadnock Mountain, a ham radio center.
   Green provided jobs, paid taxes on a multimillion-dollar
business and put the town on the map with ``a good grade of
magazines,'' Selectman Merton Dyer said.
   He was elected president of the Chamber of Commerce and, by his
own account, raised attendance from eight to 100 within two months
by presenting, Green said, more interesting speakers.
   But, as DeTray put it, ``He's not your average taciturn New
Englander. He probably grated on a lot of townspeople.''
   ``He has bright ideas, but no depth to them,'' said Tom
Westheimer, another former employee. ``He hires people to implement
them, and when it doesn't work, he fires them.''
   He also has had personal problems. Green claims he was convicted
of tax evasion in the early 1970s because he wrote editorials
critical of the Internal Revenue Service.
   Then Bell Telephone in Los Angeles sued after he published a
circuit number _ he claims he was only repeating something that had
been published elsewhere _ that enabled readers to make toll-free
calls.
   The case ended when he agreed not to publish any more
information on various telephone company devices.
   In the early 1980s, he said he was sued by CBS Inc., which
claimed the use of the name Digital Audio for one of his magazines
was too close to one of their trademarks. Green said CBS later
dropped the suit.
   And there was the disagreement with his first wife, Virginia,
over who created Byte, considered the oldest and most successful
computer magazine. Green said the magazine, begun in the mid-1970s,
was in her name because of his tax situation.
   A lawsuit and countersuit ensued, and Green wrote about the
dispute for years in editorials. He even put up a billboard in
front of his office that read, ``Merry Christmas To All But One.''
   It is symptomatic of his special brand of success _ and perhaps
his biggest regret _ that Green has achieved more notoriety than
acclaim.
   ``I've accomplished a lot of things, and not many people know
about it,'' he said. ``That bothers me.''

<HEAD>National Westminster Earnings Nearly Triple from Weak Year-ago
Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Westminster Bank PLC, one of Britain's
largest banks, said Tuesday its half-year earnings nearly tripled
from a year earlier, when its results were hurt by major additions
to provisions for loans to developing countries.
   The bank said earnings for the six months ended June 30
increased to 446 million pounds, the equivalent of $767 million, or
59 pence a share, from 150 million pounds, or 20 pence a share, a
year ago.
   National Westminster added 6 million pounds to its provisions
for developing country loans in the first half of 1988, compared
with 496 million pounds in the same period last year.
   Total income, which includes interest, commission, investment
and foreign exchange trading income, grew 15 percent to 2.34
billion pounds from 2.04 billion pounds.
   Investment banking continued to be a troublesome area for
National Westminster, in part because of the depressed securities
markets. Investment banking operations had a pre-tax loss of 10
million pounds, compared with a 2 million-pound pre-tax profit a
year ago.
   National Westminster's total assets rose 19 percent to 102.5
billion pounds from 86.3 billion pounds.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amfac Inc. said Tuesday it has agreed to a
$49 per share all-cash merger with JMB Realty Corp. in a deal
valued at $920 million.
   The board of directors of Amfac approved the proposal
unanimously, according to a company statement.
   A newly organized affiliate of Chicago-based JMB Realty would
merge into Amfac, the surviving entity, and ``each outstanding
Amfac share will be converted into $49 in cash,'' the statement
said.
   Amfac stock was down 87{ cents a share to $46.87{ at midday
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   JMB Realty is a privately-held real estate investment,
development and management firm. It owns interests in real
properties with a gross value of more than $20 billion.
   The board considered other offers, the statement said, including
a renewed bid by a management group led by Amfac President and
Chief Executive Officer Richard L. Griffith.
   The management group attempted to buy the company for $836
million two months ago and submitted another proposal during the
weekend.
   Amfac Board Chairman Henry Walker Jr. said the board was assured
JMB ``intends to utilize Amfac's considerable wide-ranging
involvement in Hawaii community activites.'' Amfac is Hawaii's
largest private landowner.
   Analysts had long expected competing bidders to beat the
management plan. They said the offer did not value highly enough
the company's property in Hawaii.
   But analysts also speculated Amfac's management-led buyout was a
move designed to stave off a takeover threat by Castle & Cook Inc.,
a Los Angeles-based concern that holds a large block of Amfac stock
and that is the second-largest private landowner in Hawaii.
   Amfac is a diversified services company with main lines of
business in food processing, hotels and resorts, retail,
agriculture and property. It reported revenue of $2.2 billion last
year. The company's principal executive offices are located in
Honolulu.

   Crop futures prices opened sharply lower again
today on the Chicago Board of Trade but analysts said the markets
may be nearing the bottom of a week-long slide prompted by recent
rains in the drought-stricken Farm Belt.
   ``I think the market's gone too far down,'' said Cathy Leow,
assistant vice president in charge of grain futures trading for
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``I think the market's overdone the rains we've gotten and it's
still ignoring the fact that we have a phenomenal amount of (crop)
damage,'' she said.
   Scattered showers in the Midwest during the past week improved
the condition of corn and soybean crops in most major growing
states, according to agricultural experts. And the National Weather
Service's latest 6-to-10-day outlook predicts normal precipitation
in the region early next week.
   But Ms. Leow said losses totaling more than $2 a bushel in the
soybean pit in the past seven sessions do not reflect the
irreparable damage already done to the crop.
   In early trading, wheat was 4 cents to 6{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.65 a bushel; corn was 11{
cents to 13{ cents lower with September at $2.91 a bushel; oats
were 4{ cents to 6{ cents lower with September at $2.47{ a bushel;
soybeans were 24 cents to 30 cents lower with August at $7.74 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed to lower in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .08 cent to .37 cent lower with August at 66.27
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .20 cent higher
with August at 77.50 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower to .38
cent higher with August at 45.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .42 cent to 1.35 cents lower with August at 35.45 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher while pork futures were sharply
lower on Monday.

<HEAD>Government Lifts Import Ban On Beef</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea announced Tuesday it was
lifting a three-year-old ban on imports of foreign beef, but said
it would maintain an import quota system that has been opposed by
the United States.
   Agriculture Minister Yun Kun-hwan said imports for 1988 would be
limited to 14,500 tons. Yun did not say how much beef would be
imported after this year, but indicated imports would be limited in
order to protect the local beef industry.
   The end to the import ban was designed to avoid trade friction
with foreign countries while at the same time alleviating domestic
beef shortages, Yun said.
   The United States has been pressing South Korea to drop the ban
on beef imports to help correct Seoul's $10 billion trade imbalance
with Washington. The United States is also pressing South Korea to
drop restrictions or bans on many other imports and opposes the
beef quota system.
   There was no immediate reaction from local farmers who have
strongly opposed imports of beef unless the government guaranteed a
definite price support system before lifting the import ban.
   Many Korean farmers went bankrupt due to an excessive import of
foreign beef cattle before the last ban was imposed in 1985.
Farmers have staged demonstrations to demand retention of the
import ban.
   As reported previously, Yun said the proposed tonnage would
include 3,000 tons of high quality beef for use at tourist hotels
to be imported from the United States. Officials said high quality
beef could start arriving next month.
   The remaining 11,500 tons of both high quality and ordinary
quality beef would be for general public consumption with sales
open to the United States, Australia and other bidders.
   Yun said imported beef will be stockpiled for sales in case
domestic sales prices exceed designated levels to seek price
stabilization.

   Republican congressional leaders told
President Reagan today to use his ``best instincts'' in considering
whether to veto the plant- closing bill. One key GOP senator
predicted the legislation will become law no matter what the
president does.
   House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois told reporters
that ``arguments were made on both sides of the issue'' in a
meeting of GOP leaders with the president at the White House.
   ``Some of us in the House of Representatives made the point that
we were within the range of being able to sustain the president's
veto if there were some work done and there wasn't a diminution of
votes on the Democratic side,'' Michel said.
   ``There were arguments made on the other side too that frankly
it was probably impossible to sustain in the Senate and that maybe
the president would want to give consideration to simply letting it
become law,'' he said.
   Michel said the president ``did not give an expression one way
or another at all'' as to his intentions. The president told
reporters at the opening of the meeting that he never decides about
a bill until it reaches his desk.
   When asked what he believed the president would do, Michel said,
``He's a very pragmatic individual and has been over eight years of
time. I think the last word that was said was,`Mr. President, just
use your best instincts.''
   Michel said that ``arguments were made with respect to how it
may or may not affect the campaign,'' but Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., said, ``I don't think it will make much difference.''
   ``My guess is plant closing will become law but the parts about
layoffs will be very controversial and will lead to some litigation
later on,'' he said.``I think probably the vote is there in both
houses to override.''
   Lugar said the Republicans in the meeting ``were expressing
pretty good vote counts but saying the president ought to do his
thing.''
   The bill requires companies to give workers 60 days' notice of
plant closings and layoffs.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that Reagan
is likely to go ahead and veto the bill.
   But the spokesman also said no final decision had been made.
   ``It's always open until it's done,'' Fitzwater told reporters
after the arrived at the White House for Reagan's signature.
   The legislation passed both the House and Senate by veto-proof
margins, and some Republicans have said they're reluctant to vote
against it because of polls showing broad public support for the
proposal.
   Fitzwater disputed assertions that Republicans may be preparing
to deliver that sort of message to Reagan, saying, ``I would say
there are number of them who will recommend a veto.''
   Reagan has until Aug. 3 to make a decision. He could veto the
bill, sign it, or let it pass automatically into law without his
signature.
   The administration's stand on the issue has been repeatedly
assailed by Democrats, who say common decency requires that workers
be told when they are about to lose their jobs. Reagan says
business should have the ``flexibility'' to close plants and lay
off workers without the 60 days' notice.
   Vice President George Bush, certain to get the Republican
nomination for president in New Orleans next month, has stated
sentiments similar to Reagan's on the issue, although there have
been reports the Bush campaign would prefer to see the president
let the bill become law to ease the political heat on Bush.

<HEAD>Farm State Congressman Predicts Early Approval of Drought Relief</HEAD>

   The House Agriculture Committee plowed forward
today with efforts to fashion a drought-relief package following a
warning from President Reagan not to ``bust the budget'' with aid
to desperate farmers.
   ``It ain't over 'til it's over, and it's never over in this
committee,'' House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la
Garza, D-Texas, declared as the lawmakers scrambled to meet a
self-imposed deadline of writing a bill and putting it on the floor
of the House this week.
   A mound of amendments still faced the committee, which had
announced prior to the congressional break for the Democratic
National Convention that it had finished with all but the
formalities. But de la Garza was still shooting for a quick wrapup
followed by floor action this week and a House-Senate conference
committee next week.
   As the lawmakers went back into session, Deputy Secretary of
Agriculture Peter Myers told them that the administration's
specific objections boiled down to two features now in the
legislation.
   One would streamline and expand the system under which the
Agriculture Department provides feed aid to livestock producers.
The other would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance in
the future as a condition of getting relief.
   ``We don't think that makes much sense,'' Myers said. Major
grower groups wrote to lawmakers on Monday to urge an end to the
crop-insurance provision.
   In his letter Monday to the lawmakers, Reagan warned against
``creating windfalls for some'' as part of the bill because it
would ``mean less for the truly deserving.'' He said farmers who
bought crop insurance ``should not be penalized relative to farmers
who did not act with such prudence.''
   The measure should not ``include any incentive for a farmer to
plow under his crops,'' Reagan said. He also said it was necessary
to keep a rein on spending.
   ``To put it very simply, we must not bust the budget,'' Reagan
said. He reiterated that lawmakers should not start rewriting the
1985 farm act.
   Earlier, the chairman of a key House panel said he hoped to
speed congressional approval of the drought relief package, which
could come to $6 billion or more, much of it taken from $7.5
billion in government savings arising from the drought.
   Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said getting money to family
farmers quickly was a top concern as the House Agriculture
Committee began debate today on drought relief with an eye toward
floor action Thursday.
   Members of Congress and administration officials have raised
concerns that the plan may go too far in helping large farm
businesses and President Reagan has said he wants a trim and
tightly targeted relief bill.
   ``There are a number of things we would like to see not added on
to these bills,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said today on
the NBC-TV ``Today'' program. ``The president does not want this
bill to be a Christmas Tree (with) ornaments hung all over it.''
   The aid money would come from an estimated $9 billion in
government savings in federal subsidies this year for some farmers
who are benefiting from higher agriculture prices.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Budget
Committee, called for slower deliberation to ensure the destination
of aid money is controlled.
   ``We're spending money not just on the family farmer, but to
help agribusiness,'' said Schumer. ``I would say we can do a lot
better job of honing where the money will go. Instead of doing it
this Thursday, let's do it next Thursday if we have to.''
   The drought relief bill has pitted some farm groups against each
other, with dairy producers squared off against beef producers and
some consumer groups.
   Dairy producers want Congress to increase milk price supports to
counter the rising cost of feed for their herds and a decrease in
production due to the drought and heat. They argue that shoppers
will pay higher food bills if the relief isn't granted.
   The drought-hurt dairy farmers deserve some federal aid, such as
feed assistance, but ``legislating a higher dairy support price is
not justifiable,'' said Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a
national consumer group.
   ``Once again, the dairy producers are going whole hog for a
special deal that would cost Americans more as taxpayers and as
consumers,'' said Public Voice executive director Ellen Haas. ``And
higher food prices impact hardest on those least able to pay.
Mandating higher support prices for milk after feed costs slacken
would once again encourage overproduction and government costs.''

   Stock prices declined slightly in quiet trading
today, continuing Monday's mixed pattern.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.42 to 2,070.41
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 543 up, 657 down and
543 unchanged.
   Analysts said many investors were avoiding making big
commitments in advance of the Commerce Department's report due out
Wednesday on the gross national product for the second quarter of
the year.
   Private estimates generally call for inflation-adjusted GNP
growth to come in at about the same 3.6 percent annual rate
reported for the first quarter.
   Anything much higher than that might intensify worries about
inflation and higher interest rates, brokers said.
   Today the government said new factory orders for durable goods
jumped 8.8 percent in June. However, brokers said the figure wasn't
regarded as conclusive, because most of the increase came in
military goods, a category that is often subject to wide
month-by-month fluctuations.
   Phillips Petroleum rose { to 17 in active trading. The company
reported sharply higher earnings for the second quarter.
   Sears Roebuck, on the other hand, dropped \ to 35| as the
company posted slightly lower quarterly profits.
   Microsoft fell 3 to 57{ in over-the-counter trading. The company
reported higher quarterly profits, but the results evidently fell
short of many investors' expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .05 to 149.69. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .25 at 304.43.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 56.72 million shares at
noontime, against 140.57 million at the same point Monday, when the
total was inflated by dividend-related trading in a few
high-yielding issues.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest
retailer and a financial services conglomerate, on Tuesday reported
a 5.4 percent drop in its second-quarter earnings despite higher
revenue for the period.
   Sales at Sears stores advanced 7 percent over a year ago,
compared with revenue gains of more than 10 percent in each of the
company's three other major operating units, Sears said in a
statement.
   Sears reported net income of $369.4 million, or 98 cents per
share, for the three months ended June 30, compared with $390.4
million, or $1.03 per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Revenue rose 10.8 percent to $12.98 billion from $11.72 billion
a year earlier.
   The Sears Merchandise Group, which includes the more than 800
Sears department stores, had second-quarter revenue of $7.2
billion, compared with $6.7 billion a year ago.
   Income from the stores group rose 10.5 percent to $188.8 million
but the results included a gain of $31 million from an accounting
change. Excluding that gain, income from the Sears Merchandise
Group fell $13 million from the $170.8 million reported for the
second quarter of 1987.
   ``The merchandise group continues to perform quite badly,'' said
Edward Weller, a retail industry analyst with Montgomery Securities
Inc. in San Francisco.
   Weller said the merchandise division performed sluggishly
despite ``adjustments and realignments,'' including moves into
specialty retailing via Sears' recent purchases of the Pinstripe
Petites and Western Auto chains.
   In March, Sears announced it was restructuring the management of
its merchandising sector to make the unit more profitable and more
responsive to changing consumer tastes.
   Second-quarter revenue from the Allstate Insurance Group rose
17.5 percent to $4.5 billion while income from the unit fell 17.5
percent to $206.6 million. Sears blamed the income decline on an
accounting change and an increase in claims.
   The Dean Witter Financial Services Group, which includes the
Discover card, had quarterly revenue of $1.05 billion, up 11.2
percent from 1987. Income from the unit fell 51 percent to $15.1
million. Sears said the year-ago income figure of $31 million
included a $58 million gain from the sale of Sears Savings Bank
branch offices.
   Sears reported a $100,000 profit for the Discover credit card
operation, marking the second consecutive profitable quarter for
the card after two years of losses.
   Sears has said it expects the card to break even this year.
   The Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group had quarterly revenue of
$371.5 million, a 10.2 percent increase. Income from the unit
advanced nearly 19 percent to $15.2 million.
   For the first six months of 1988, Sears had net income of $548.9
million, or $1.45 per share, down 20 percent from $678.3 million,
or $1.78 per share, for the first half of 1987.
   First-half revenue totaled $25.14 billion, up 13.3 percent from
$22.20 billion for the first six months of 1987.

<HEAD>Control Data, Microsoft Report Quarterly Earnings</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. and Microsoft Corp., two major computer
products companies, on Tuesday reported gains in quarterly net
income.
   Control Data, based in Bloomington, Minn., said its net income
for the second quarter totaled $9.2 million, or 22 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $5.5 million in the year-ago period.
   Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $951.7 million, up
21 percent from $785.9 million in 1987.
   Robert M. Price, chairman and chief executive officer, said
attributed the growth to revenue increases in the company's
business services and data storage products businesses.
   Revenue growth in the business services unit reflects the
acquisition of the SAMI-Burke marketing information business in
late 1987.
   Control Data provides computer products and services for
scientific, engineering and business applications worldwide.
   For the first six months of 1988, Control Data reported net
income of $16.9 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenues of $1.85
billion, compared with net earnings of $1.7 million, or 3 cents a
share, on revenues of $1.61 billion in 1987.
   In Redmond, Wash., Microsoft reported a 74 percent jump in
fourth quarter net income. Profits for the quarter ended June 30
totaled $30.01 million, or 54 cents a share, up from $17.26
million, or 31 cents a share for the same period in 1987.
   The personal computer software manufacturer said its
fourth-quarter revenue totaled $170.47 million, up 71 percent from
$99.76 million a year ago.
   ``These results represent strength across all channels of
distribution and in all product groups,'' said Jon Shirley,
Microsoft president and chief operating officer. ``Our
international operations were particularly strong, generating 47.8
percent of revenues for the year.''
   For the fiscal year, net income totaled $123.91 million, or
$2.22 a share, on revenues of $590.83 million, up from profits of
$71.88 million, or $1.30 a share, on revenues of $345.89 million
for fiscal 1987.

   Transamerica Corp. on Tuesday reported
earnings from continuing operations rose 7 percent in the second
quarter, partly boosted by the acquisition of a commercial lending
operation.
   Profits from continuing operations totaled $87.6 million, or
$1.12 per share, up from $82.1 million, or $1.05 per share, in the
second quarter of 1987.
   Consolidated net income, however, fell to $89.45 million from
$105.96 million in the year-ago quarter. The financial services
concern posted a $1.87 million after-tax gain from investment
transactions in the second quarter. That's down from a similar gain
of $8.26 million and $15.6 million in gains from discontinued
operations posted in 1987.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $1.996 billion, up from $1.977
billion for the same period in 1987.
   The insurance and financial services giant said expansion of its
commercial lending and leasing operations contributed to the
quarter and six-month earnings gains.
   ``Our insurance and finance operations both achieved outstanding
results, reflecting the fundamental strength and earning power of
our businesses,'' said James R. Harvey, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Profits from continuing operations during the first half of 1988
were $163.1 million, or $2.08 per share, up 9 percent from 1987's
$149.9 million, or $1.91 per share.
   First half consolidated net income for 1988 totaled $166
million, including $3 million in other gains, while first-half 1987
consolidated net income of $217 million included $33 million of
other gains and $34 million in income from discontinued oprations,
said Richard J. Olsen, vice president of corporate relations.
   Total revenues for the first six months of 1988 were $3.975
billion, up from $3.810 billion for the same period last year, the
company said.
   The company expanded its commercial lending operation with the
acquisition in October 1987 of the Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp.,
now called Transamerica Commercial Finance Corp.
   In its life insurance operation, profits were increased by
reducing expenses and higher yields on invested assets, the company
said. Property and casualty insurance increases were attributed to
expansions in workers' compensation and re-insurance production.

<TEXT>
   USX Corp. said Tuesday its second-quarter
profits rose 29 percent as its steel division outperformed the
energy operations that had carried the company for most of the
decade.
   ``It's back to being a steel company again'' in terms of
generating profits, said steel industry analyst Charles Bradford of
Merrill Lynch & Co. USX reported it earned $213 million, or 74
cents per share, up from $165 million, or 56 cents per share, in
the second quarter of 1987.
   Sales for the quarter rose 7.5 percent to $4.3 billion from $4
billion.
   The company's USS division, the nation's largest steelmaker,
turned in operating profits of $223 million on sales of $1.6
billion, or nearly $70 per ton of steel shipped.
   The USX energy segment, comprising Marathon Oil Co. and Texas
Oil & Gas Corp., operated at a profit of $104 million on sales of
$2.4 billion.
   Marathon's operating profit was $120 million on sales of $2.2
billion, while Texas Oil & Gas lost $16 million on sales of $201
million.
   USX Chairman David Roderick said lower crude oil prices and
higher exploration costs dampened Marathon's performance.
   But, said analyst Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball & Turben, ``The
energy division is still profitable despite $15 (a barrel) oil.''
   ``It's not a drag'' on earnings, he said.
   USX's diversified businesses showed profits of $69 million on
sales of $389 million, up from $5 million on sales of $235 million
in the year-ago period.
   USX acquired Marathon in 1982 and Texas Oil & Gas four years
later. ``During the period when steel was still down, the cash flow
from these operations helped support the whole debt structure,''
Lazier said.
   Now steel is coming on strong and energy is languishing.
``Roderick's strategy looks increasingly good,'' Lazier said.
   First half profits totaled $370 million, or $1.26 per share,
compared to $93 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first six months of the year totaled $8.3
billion, up from $6.7 billion.

<HEAD>LTV Joins Bethlehem In Jan. Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Steel Corp., the nation's second-largest
steelmaker, said Tuesday it is joining No. 3 Bethlehem in boosting
prices on flat-rolled products by $15 to $30 per ton effective Jan.
1.
   The moves appear to undercut USX Corp.'s efforts to raise its
prices on Oct. 1.
   Inland and Armco, the fourth- and fifth-largest steelmakers
respectively, said Tuesday they had not decided whether to follow
suit. Officials of No. 6 National Steel could not be reached
Tuesday for comment.
   USX announced its plans early this month. Bethlehem followed
last week with an announcement that it was delaying a price hike
until after the fourth quarter.
   ``Japan did not raise export prices to the U.S. for the fourth
quarter, and that might be what Bethlehem is worrying about,'' said
steel industry analyst Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch & Co.
   ``Most of them would prefer to go along with USX,'' he said.
``Business is pretty good.''
   Bradford said he expected USX to back down on its Oct. 1 date.
   A USX spokesman declined comment Tuesday.
   The affected products include sheet steel used in automobiles,
appliances, office furniture and a variety of other consumer goods.

   Stock prices eked out a small gain Tuesday in
the slowest trading in more than five weeks, as Wall Street awaited
the latest reading on the pace of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.14 to
2,073.97.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
764 up, 676 down and 513 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 121.96 million
shares, down from 215.14 million in the previous session and the
smallest total since a 116.75 million-share day on June 20.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 142.60 million shares.
   Analysts said many investors were avoiding making big
commitments in advance of the Commerce Department's report due out
Wednesday on the gross national product for the second quarter of
the year.
   Private estimates generally call for inflation-adjusted GNP
growth to come in at about the same 3.6 percent annual rate
reported for the first quarter.
   Anything much higher than that might intensify worries about
inflation and higher interest rates, brokers said.
   On Tuesday the government said new factory orders for durable
goods jumped 8.8 percent in June. However, brokers said the figure
wasn't regarded as conclusive, because most of the increase came in
military goods, a category that is often subject to wide
month-by-month fluctuations.
   While the overall market made little progress, many individual
issues went their own separate ways responding to corporate
earnings reports.
   USX, for example, fell 1 to 30[ amid some evident disappointment
over the size of its second-quarter earnings gain. Per-share
profits increased to 74 cents from 56 cents in the like period a
year ago.
   Phillips Petroleum rose { to 17 in active trading. The company
reported sharply higher earnings for the second quarter.
   Sears Roebuck, on the other hand, dropped \ to 35| as the
company posted slightly lower quarterly profits.
   Microsoft fell 2{ to 58 in over-the-counter trading. The company
reported higher quarterly profits, but the results evidently fell
short of many investors' expectations.
   Cadnetix, another OTC issue, tumbled 1| to 5\. The company,
which produces specialized computer work stations, said its fiscal
quarter ended June 30 came in at about the break-even level.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.03 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .29 to 150.03.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .51 to 306.45, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .51 at 265.19.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
1.33 to 385.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 304.64, down .04.

<HEAD>Polaroid Reaffirms Decision to Reject Shamrock Takeover Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. said Tuesday its will
give ``due consideration'' to a buyout offer from Shamrock Holdings
despite its ambiguity.
   The Polaroid board, in a regularly scheduled meeting, said it
has retained Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to study Shamrock's
proposal to acquire the company for $40 a share. But Polaroid
reiterated that it believes its strategic plan is sound.
   The instant-film company said Shamrock's interest may be
contingent on the absence of an employee stock ownership plan and
on access to funds in the Polaroid pension plan.
   Shamrock's offer values Polaroid at about $2.88 billion based on
71.9 million shares outstanding. But Shamrock has indicated it
might not proceed unless it manages to get the recent issue of 10
million shares rescinded. That would lower the value of the bid to
$2.48 billion.
   Polaroid said the recently established employee stock plan has
purchased about 9.7 million shares of common stock from the
company. Polaroid said that purchase, as well as the dedication of
pension funds to benefit employees and retirees, cannot be reversed.
   Shamrock is a California investment firm controlled by Roy
Disney, nephew of the late Walt Disney, and his family.
   After Disney unveiled his proposal, Polaroid management issued a
statement reiterating its support for a restructuring plan
announced earlier this month that inclues layoffs and cost-cutting.
   ``We firmly believe that this is, without doubt, the right
course for Polaroid and for all of its shareholders, employees,
customers and communities,'' it said.

<HEAD>SEC Charges Two in Insider Trading Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Tuesday charged a former official of a British investment firm and
former official of a Los Angeles brokerage house with engaging in
an insider trading scheme.
   The SEC filed a civil complaint in federal district court in Los
Angeles against Geoffrey W. Collier, a British citizen living in
New York City, and Michael B. Cassell, a British citizen living in
Los Angeles.
   Collier is a former managing director of Morgan Grenfell
Securities LTD, a London securities firm, and Cassell is a former
director of Vickers da Costa Securities, a Los Angeles brokerage
firm.
   In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Collier, through his
employment at Morgan Grenfell, learned that two British companies,
Cadbury-Schweppes and Associated Engineering, were likely targets
of takeover attempts, efforts that normally push a company's stock
up in value.
   The SEC alleged that Collier purchased securities on the London
stock exchange through accounts managed by Cassell at the Los
Angeles brokerage firm.
   The complaint said that Collier asked Cassell to buy options to
purchase Cadbury-Schweppes stock after Collier learned through his
job that a bid for the company was being discussed in mid-October
1986.
   The SEC also charged that Collier and Cassell placed orders in
early November 1986 to buy stock in Associated Engineering after
Collier learned that a client at Morgan Grenfell was planning to
make a bid for the company. The SEC said that Cassell placed orders
for Collier and himself for 60,000 shares of Associated Engineering
stock.
   The SEC said that neither Collier nor Cassell profited from the
trades.
   Under a proposed settlement, the two men consented to the entry
of injunctions barring them from any future securities law
violations.
   Collier admitted to the allegations of the complaint, but
Cassell neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations.

<HEAD>Plunging Crop Futures Spark Broad Decline in Other Commodities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices plunged for the seventh straight day
Tuesday, triggering massive selloffs and huge price declines in
several other U.S. commodity markets as speculators took profits.
   ``Today the commodities had their Black Tuesday,'' said Bert
Ruiz, vice president in charge of coffee futures at Balfour
Maclaine Corp. ``Everybody was getting out of commodities.''
   Grain futures plunged along with soybeans on the Chicago Board
of Trade while prices for coffee, sugar, livestock and silver
futures plummeted on other exchanges. Energy futures declined
moderately while stock-index futures advanced.
   The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities skidded
8.11 points to 245.52, the steepest one-day drop for the closely
watched inflation barometer since its record 9.7-point fall on Dec.
11, 1980.
   Most Chicago crop futures fell their permitted daily limits on
better rain prospects in the Midwest and reports that recent
showers had helped the crops.
   ``It's a real panic right now,'' said Katharina Zimmer, grains
analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. ``You've
got people just saying, `Let me out.' They're scrambling.''
   The contract for August delivery of soybeans settled at $7.55{ a
bushel, the lowest soybean futures price since May 26, when the
July contract settled at $7.54.
   The National Weather Service's latest 6-to-10-day outlook,
issued late Monday, predicted normal precipitation in most of the
Midwest during the first five days of next week.
   And the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday that
scattered showers in the Midwest during the past week had relieved
drought stress in parts of the Corn Belt. State agriculture
officials generally reported improved corn and soybean conditions.
   Cathy Leow, assistant vice president of grain futures trading
for Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York, said the soybean
market was probably nearing a bottom after losing nearly $2.40 a
bushel in the past seven sessions.
   ``I think the market has overdone the rains we've gotten and
it's still ignoring the fact that we have a phenomenal amount of
(crop) damage,'' she said.
   The next official estimate of the drought damage will be the
Agriculture Department's next crop report on Aug. 11.
   Wheat settled 19 cents to the limit 20 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.51} a bushel; corn was 9\
cents to the limit 15 cents lower with September at $2.87{ a
bushel; oats were 9 cents to the limit 10 cents lower with
September at $2.44 a bushel; soybeans were 18{ cents to the limit
45 cents lower with August at $7.55{ a bushel.
   Sugar and coffee futures tumbled on New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange in massive sell-offs.
   Analysts linked the selling to disappointment over the markets'
inability to break free of the bearish influence of the soybean
market, even when positive news surfaced.
   The sugar market, for example, ignored bullish news that China
had bought 250,000 tons of sugar, said Judith Ganes, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   She described the sugar sell-off as ``massive, massive
liquidation and profit-taking.''
   Coffee analyst Ruiz said heavy news coverage of the Midwestern
drought had persuaded many small investors to gamble on rising
commodity prices ``and today was the bloodbath.''
   Coffee for September delivery settled 4.84 cents lower at
$1.3295 a pound; October sugar was 2.41 cents lower at 12.06 cents
a pound.
   Most most livestock and meat futures prices fell sharply on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .48 cent to 1.15 cents lower with August at
65.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with August at 77.57 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent to
the limit 1.50 cents lower with August at 45.30 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.15 cents to the limit 2 cents lower with
August at 34.80 cents a pound.
   Gold futures advanced but silver fell steeply in mostly
technical trading on New York's Commodity Exchange, analysts said.
   Gold settled $5.10 to $5.60 higher with August at $431.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 15.6 cents to 17.7 cents lower with July at $6.88
a troy ounce.
   Most oil futures prices headed lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in quiet, directionless trading highlighted mainly by
technical factors.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 9 cents
lower with September at $15.96 a barrel; heating oil was .39 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with August at 43.81 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to 1.06 cents lower with August at
50.16 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled 1.30 points higher at 266.15.

<HEAD>Texaco, Chevron, Phillips Report Higher Profit; Amerada Hess Posts
Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of the nation's major oil companies, Texaco Inc., Chevron
Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co., on Tuesday said their profit for
the second quarter was boosted by strength in refining, marketing
and chemicals operations.
   Amerada Hess Corp., the 15th largest U.S. oil company, reported
a net loss of $23.5 million, compared with a year-earlier profit of
$89.4 million, or $1.06 a share.
   Texaco, the nation's third biggest oil company, said its
second-quarter net income quadrupled, lifted by refining, marketing
and chemicals as well as the sale of its West German subsidiary.
   The oil giant earned $527 million, or $2.17 a share, up from
$129 million, or 53 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 10.6 percent, to $9.4 billion from
$8.5 billion a year earlier.
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., emerged on April 7 from
bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the federal code. The
company paid $3 billion to settle litigation with Pennzoil Co. and
initiated another $2.6 billion in payments to its other creditors.
   Texaco's earnings for the latest quarter include an after-tax
gain of $301 million, or $1.24 a share, from the sale of its West
German subsidiary, Deutsche Texaco A.G.
   The sale was part of the company's restructuring program under
the Chapter 11 proceedings. Texaco also signed a letter of intent
in June to form a joint venture with Saudi investors to refine and
market oil products in parts of the United States.
   In the first half of the year, net income tripled to $769
million, or $3.17 a share, from $247 million, or $1.02 a share, in
the same period in 1987. First-half revenue was up 6.5 percent, to
$18.1 billion from $17.0 billion.
   Fourth-ranked Chevron, based in San Francisco, said its
second-quarter profit jumped 45 percent _ to $520 million, or $1.52
a share, from $358 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue was unchanged from a year earlier, at
$7.3 billion.
   Chevron Chairman George Keller said the company's profit margins
from sales of oil products were the highest in two years, while
chemical operations continued to benefit from strong demand in the
industrial market.
   Earnings in the first six months increased 63 percent _ to $1.2
billion, or $3.43 a share, from $719 million, or $2.10 a share.
Revenue for the period edged up 5 percent, to $14.8 billion from
$14.1 billion.
   Phillips, the nation's eighth biggest oil company, saw its
earnings in the quarter soar to $170 million, or 72 cents a share,
from $3 million a year earlier.
   The Bartlesville, Okla.-based company said that although its
gains were broad-based, refining and marketing were especially
strong.
   First-half profit was $300 million, or $1.27 a share, compared
with a loss of $29 million in January-June 1987. Revenue for the
six months rose to $5.78 billion from $5.18 billion.
   New York-based Amerada Hess said its second-quarter net loss of
$23.5 million included a loss from refining and marketing
operations of $6.5 million, compared with profit of $55.7 million a
year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue fell to $882.8 million from $1.1 billion
a year earlier.
   In the first half, Amerada Hess earned $42.2 million, or 51
cents a share, down from $270.8 million, or $3.21 a share. Revenue
for the period declined to $2.1 billion from $2.4 billion.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the United Transportation
Union and Chicago & North Western Railway on Tuesday failed to
resolve a labor dispute that could halt rail service for 40,000
Chicago-area commuters.
   Negotiations in the presence of federal mediators adjourned for
the day without an accord, but a government official said he would
not characterize the talks as unproductive.
   ``They're still talking,'' said Charles R. Barnes, executive
director of the National Mediation Board. ``All I can really say is
that mediation is in progress and, as far as we're concerned, it's
going to go right down to the deadline. ... We'll be available as
long as we can help.''
   While the two sides met behind closed doors at the board's
Washington offices, an Illinois congressman introduced legislation
to push them closer to an agreement and block a threatened Aug. 4
strike. C&NW provides the principal daily rail service for about
40,000 commuters in the Chicago area.
   ``Although I dislike intervention by the federal government, we
cannot stand idly by,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill. ``Congress
may act if they fail to do so.''
   Porter's bill would require the company and union to accept as
binding the recommendations of a presidential emergency board
appointed to examine the dispute if the two sides fail to reach
agreement on their own by the strike deadline.
   At issue is a plan by Chicago & North Western, a subsidiary of
CNW Corp., to cut costs by eliminating the jobs of 1,156 of its
2,600 union brakemen.
   Company spokeswoman Leslie Cleveland said the nation's
eighth-largest rail carrier could save $51 million a year and
become more competitive if it reduced the size of its train crews
from an engineer, conductor and two brakemen to only an engineer
and conductor in most cases.
   The company contends that improved technology has made the jobs
obsolete. The union insists safety would be compromised without the
brakemen and said the cuts would violate its contract.
   The outcome of the dispute could set a precedent for crew sizes
throughout the rail industry, which is entering national bargaining
with its unions this year.
   A threatened UTU strike was averted in April when President
Reagan, acting under provisions of the Railway Labor Act, appointed
an emergency board to investigate the dispute. As part of his
order, the union was prohibited from striking before 12:01 a.m. on
Aug. 4.
   In a 29-page report to the president on July 1, the emergency
board proposed doing away with 689 brakemen's jobs, cutting one
brakeman per train in most cases and both brakemen when approved by
an arbitrator on a train-by-train basis.
   ``Without such relief, (C&NW) will be forced to take more
drastic economic action which could jeopardize the livelihood of
all its employees,'' the board said.
   United Transportation Union Chairman Fred Hardin said the report
was not acceptable.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
Tuesday, encouraged by a government report that durable goods
orders reached a 30-month high in June.
   Gold prices also rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a bid of $431.90 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from
a five-month low of $427.25 reached Monday.
   Analysts said many dollar traders were on the sidelines,
reluctant to make large commitments in advance of Wednesday's
scheduled release of the government's gross national product
figures for the second quarter.
   The Commerce Department's durable goods report provided one of
the few sparks in Tuesday's trading. Analysts said a plunge in
commodity prices and weakness in the bond market had little impact
on the dollar.
   ``The market was looking for something to hold onto and durable
goods was the primary impetus that took the dollar up,'' said Ron
Sapiro, vice president for foreign exchange at Continental Illinois
National Bank & Trust Co.
   The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose 8.8
percent in June, their biggest increase since an 8.9 percent jump
in December 1985.
   In overseas trading, dealers said the dollar was helped by
suspicions that the U.S. Federal Reserve might be forced to tighten
credit after the GNP report.
   Dealers predicted the GNP figures would indicate continued
strong economic growth as well as inflationary pressures.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.7135 late in the day in
London, compared with late Monday's $1.7265. In later New York
trading, the pound slipped to $1.7075 from $1.7210 late Monday.
   The dollar rose 0.35 Japanese yen in Tokyo to a closing 132.15
yen. Later, in London, it edged up further to 132.50 yen, and in
New York, the dollar rose to 132.43 yen from 132.175 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.85925 West German marks, up from 1.84705 late
Monday; 1.54625 Swiss francs, up from 1.5380; 6.2615 French francs,
up from 6.2345; 1,373.25 Italian lire, up from 1,363.75; and
1.20925 Canadian dollars, down from 1.21475.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8600 West German marks, up from 1.8452; 1.5455
Swiss francs, up from 1.5345; 6.2670 French francs, up from 6.2215;
2.0975 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0745; 1,374.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,359.50; 1.2083 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2075.
   Meanwhile, gold prices moved higher.
   Jack Barbanel, a first vice president with Gruntal & Co. Inc. in
New York, said gold ``appears to be an insurance metal against the
commodity and financial markets.''
   ``People aren't playing on fears of inflation anymore,'' he
said. ``They're trading on fears of recession.''
   Gold closed at $431.10 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, up from $425.90 late Monday.
   Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid price of $433.50 a
troy ounce, down from $434.75 bid late Monday, while in Zurich, the
metal fell to $431.50 bid, down from $437.50 bid late Monday.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid price of $432.34, down from
$444.28 bid at Monday's close.
   Silver finished at $6.880 a troy ounce on the Commodity
Exchange, down from $7.036 late Monday. The metal fell sharply in
London to a late bid of $7.01 a troy ounce, down from $7.60 bid
late Monday.

   Troubled Texas American Bancshares said Tuesday it
lost $135.3 million in its second quarter, due mainly to reserves
set aside to cover potentially bad loans.
   The loss, which the company said might substantially diminish or
possibly eliminate stockholders' equity, compared with a loss of
$6.5 million for the second quarter in 1987 and a loss of $17.8
million for the first quarter of 1988.
   ``The decline in second-quarter earnings is attributed to a high
provision for loan losses, as the reserve for loan losses was
substantially enhanced during the quarter, and to an increased
negative impact form a higher level of non-performing assets,''
said Joseph M. Grant, chairman of Texas American.
   Officials said the company had $598 million in non-performing
assets after the second quarter, an increase of $62 million from
the first quarter.
   The banking company, which has $5 billion in assets, said
stockholders' equity, which had stood at $163.5 million following
the first quarter, has been reduced to $28.2 million.
   Texas American also said it lost $153 million during the first
six months of 1988, compared with a loss of $6.1 million in
first-half 1987.
   On July 20, Texas American announced a plan to merge with
National Bancshares Corporation of Texas. Under the proposal,
Minnesota investor and businessman Carl R. Pohlad and his companies
would provide up to $200 million of capital in exchange for up to
85 percent of the new company.
   The plan also would call for the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to provide $475 million in exchange for a subordinated
non-interest bearing note and 10 percent of the new company's
equity.
   Under the merger, existing shareholders of Texas American and
National Bancshares initially would receive 5 percent equity
interest in the new company. The merger is subject to approval by
shareholders of both companies and by various regulatory agencies.
   Deposits at Texas American averaged $4.5 billion for the second
quarter, a four percent decline from the first quarter of 1988.

<HEAD>Second Qtr. Profit Up 20.4 Percent At Health Care Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johnson and Johnson said Tuesday its
second-quarter earnings increased 20.4 percent from a year earlier,
paced by higher sales in its commercial, pharmaceutical and
professional businesses.
   The health care products manufacturer reported second-quarter
profit of $271 million, or $1.57 per share, compared with earnings
of $225 million, or $1.30 per share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   Sales for the quarter rose 13.9 percent, to $2.29 billion from
$2.01 billion a year earlier.
   The higher earnings were led by sales gains in the New Brunswick
company's pharmaceutical division. The division reported
second-quarter sales of $611 million, a 20.8 increase compared with
1987 sales of $506 million.
   For the first six months of the year, Johnson & Johnson earned
$550 million, or $3.19 per share, up from $460 million, or $2.66
per share, during the same period in 1987.
   Six-month sales rose 15.3 percent, to $4.6 billion from $3.99
billion.
   The lower value of the dollar against major foreign currencies,
compared with the same period last year, added $140 million to the
company's six-month sales, the company stated.

<HEAD>Florida Steel Buyout Agreement Reached</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida Steel Corp. said Tuesday it had
agreed to a senior management group's sweetened leveraged buyout
offer valued at nearly $306 million.
   Company officials also said they had reached a tentative
settlement of a class action lawsuit filed last week by
shareholders challenging the fairness of the management group's
initial $47 per share offer, valued at about $282 million.
   Under the new plan, the group offered to pay $50 cash per share
for up to 85 percent of the company's 6.01 million shares of common
stock, or 5.1 million shares. for $50 a share. Unpurchased shares
would be converted into a new series of preferred stock with a
$53.33 per share liquidation preference.
   A tender offer is to begin Thursday, and expires Aug. 24. The
buyout was conditioned on necessary financing being obtained and a
majority of shares being tendered.
   Florida Steel dipped 25 cents to $47.50 a share Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   ``The transaction represents a fair deal for shareholders,''
said J.B. Cordell, chairman of the special committee of the
company's board of directors that recommended acceptance of the new
offer. ``We are confident that the employees and customers of
Florida Steel will be well served by the continued, and now
increased, commitment of senior management.''
   The group leading the buyout includes six of the company's top
executives, including chairman and chief executive Edward L. Flom.
   The management group has arranged $278 million in short-term
bank financing to complete the buyout, and permanent financing
through $245 million in bank credit and the planned sale of about
$110 million in senior subordinated debentures.
   ``This transaction will best serve the interests of Florida
Steel's valued employees, suppliers and customers, and the
communities in which we operate, while enabling Florida Steel
management to control the destiny of the company,'' said Flom.
   Florida Steel employs 2,400 people at five mini-mills and 16
reinforcing steel fabricating plants in nine Southern states. It is
one of the largest public companies in the Tampa area.
   Net sales for the nine-month period ended June 30 were $341
million, up 28 percent from the same period last year.
   The settlement of the class action suits brought following the
management group's initial offer is subject to consummation of the
proposed buyout, negotiation of a definitive settlement and
approval by the court handling the suit.

<HEAD>Imports Of Advanced Technology Up Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's imports of advanced
technology for machinery and other projects rose 49 percent in the
first half of this year from the same period last year, government
officials said Wednesday.
   Officials at the Trade and Industry Ministry attributed the
sharp increase to changing corporate strategies to cope with the
appreciation of the Korean won and increasing labor unrest.
   Japan was the largest technology supplier with 181
contributions, followed by the United States with 90 and European
nations with 46, the officials said.
   Machinery and electronics accounted for nearly 60 percent of the
technology introduced during the period. The total also included
chemical and textile technology.
   The figures indicate South Korean corporations largely rely on
Japan for machinery-related technology, the United States for
electronic and electric technology and European nations for
chemical technology, the officials said.
   Imports included 36 technological imports for factory
automation, almost three times the figure for the first half of
1987. Officials said the increase reflected corporate efforts to
cut or freeze employment to reduce risks of labor protests.
   Labor unrest is a growing problem for South Korean companies.
Officials have reported more than 1,000 labor strikes so far this
year. Most were settled through negotiation, but some were violent
and resulted in the closings of plants, in some cases for months.
   The Korean won has appreciated by about 18 percent against the
U.S. dollar in the past year, making U.S. products relatively less
expensive.

<HEAD>SoCal Edison Proposes $2 Billion Merger With San Diego Gas &
Electric</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROSEMEAD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Diego Gas & Electric Co., which last
month said it intends to merge with an Arizona utility, has
received a rival $2 billion merger offer from the parent of giant
Southern California Edison Co., officials said Tuesday.
   The friendly stock-swap offer from SCEcorp values SDG&E at about
$2 billion based on Tuesday's closing stock price.
   SDG&E said in a news release it was studying the offer but
refused further comment. SCEcorp, recently formed as a holding
company for Edison, said it would pursue the merger _ which it
conditioned on SDG&E dropping its proposed merger with Tucson
(Ariz.) Electric Power Co. _ only if it were accepted by SDG&E
management.
   Analysts and SCEcorp termed the potential deal a boon to both
consumers and SDG&E stockholders.
   They predicted San Diego County consumers, whose electricity
bills are among the nation's highest, would get a piece of Edison's
large generating capacity. The 4.8 million customers of a combined
company, they said, would benefit because the enhanced purchasing
power of a huge, merged utility would win better prices for power
bought from utility companies elsewhere in the West.
   ``It makes total sense,'' said Edward Tirello, a securities
analyst who follows both companies for Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc.
in New York.
   He said SCEcorp's announcement said a goal of the merged
companies would be to reduce SDG&E's rates, which presently are 25
percent higher than Edison's.
   The proposal, made privately on Monday and announced by both
companies Tuesday, calls for SCEcorp to exchange 1.15 shares of its
common stock for each of the approximately 55.8 million SDG&E
shares outstanding. Preferred and other classes of stock would be
swapped at comparable rates.
   Management ranks would be thinned through attrition and
voluntary retirement, SCEcorp said.
   Any merger would require the approval of the state Public
Utilities Commission, federal regulators and the stockholders of
both companies. PUC deliberations would likely take a year.
   SDG&E's stock price rose $1.25 a share Tuesday to close at
$34.12{ in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. SCEcorp's
stock price was unchanged at $31.37{.
   On June 13, SDG&E announced a proposed merger with the Tucson
Electric Power Co. in Arizona that the companies valued at $5.7
billion.
   That merger would allow SDG&E, primarily a buyer of power rather
than a producer, to take advantage of Tucson Electric's excess
generating capacity and give Tucson a ready market for its power.
   SCEcorp said a merger with Edison would be more logical than
SDG&E's prposed merger with Tucson Electric because the companies'
coverage areas border on each other and their lines are
interconnected.
   Edison has ample power, both self-generated and purchased from
other utilities in the West, to provide for SDG&E, said spokesman
Robert Hull. The San Diego company's rates have been pushed up by
rising power prices and by the need to build high-cost transmission
systems to serve booming developments in the county.
   Edison serves 3.8 million customers across most of Southern
California. SDG&E, with 1 million customers, provides electricity
and natural gas in San Diego County and electricity in a slice of
Orange County.
   Howard Allen, SCEcorp chairman and chief executive officer,
stressed in a letter proposing the merger that it was a friendly
proposal.
   ``We have no intention of attempting to acquire your company
other than in a transaction approved by your board of directors,''
Allen said in a letter to SDG&E released by SCEcorp.
   Shearson Lehman's Tirello, author of a book predicting that such
mergers will form huge regional power companies, said a combination
would save the companies more than $200 million a year.
   ``The ratepayer does real well in San Diego simply because
Southern Cal Edison has said, `We want to bring you down to our
level as quick as we can,''' Tirello said. ``The Southern Cal
Edison ratepayer gets the advantage of increased buying power.''

   Renewed pessimism about OPEC's ability to
control its oil production has stalled the recent advance of oil
futures prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude, the nation's benchmark
grade, settled Monday at $16.05 per barrel, off 33 cents from
Friday's close. The near-term crude contract gained $1.41 per
barrel last week.
   Refined products also lost ground. The near-term contract for
wholesale gasoline fell .85 cent per gallon to settle at 51.22
cents, and heating oil dropped .78 cent per gallon to finish at
44.17 cents.
   Traders said activity was light as market attitudes turned
bearish about the cartel's chances for limiting overproduction and
firming prices.
   The market's strong move last week stemmed from bullish
interpretations of a proposed cease-fire between Persian Gulf
combatants Iran and Iraq and reports that members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would meet soon to
discuss prices.
   Both were interpreted as signs that fractious elements in the
gulf would be able to overcome their differences and prop up the
sagging oil market.
   The respected Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday that
OPEC's pricing committee would meet Aug. 3 in Switzerland, but the
news failed to inspire traders to follow through on the market's
previous gains. Instead, traders said, the market appeared to
recoil with its characteristic doubts about whether OPEC ever could
get together on the price issue.
   ``After a runup based on speculation, there's a natural amount
of profit taking,'' said Richard Redoglio of Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.

   Pillsbury Co.'s new top executive has been
criticized as lacking vital restaurant experience to turn around
the company's flagging Burger King chain, but Philip L. Smith says
he's just waiting to test his management ability.
   The troubled food giant on Monday plucked Smith from rival
General Foods Corp., where he served as chairman. The 54-year-old
Smith also served as vice chairman of Philip Morris Cos. Inc.,
which acquired General Foods in 1985. He begins his new job Aug. 1.
   Unlike General Foods, which has rested on the success of its
Oscar Mayer meats and Jell-O gelatin, Pillsbury has few high-growth
products, analysts said.
   ``Smith has been a big cheese in a company with a lot of easy
brands,'' said Stephen Carnes, a managing director at Piper Jaffray
& Hopwood in Minneapolis.
   But at Pillsbury, Smith ``will have to get down to trench
warfare, and he was never in that mode before,'' Carnes said.
Minneapolis-based Pillsbury, the nation's fourth-largest food
conglomerate, produces Green Giant vegetables, Haagen-Dazs premium
ice creams and Van de Kamp's frozen fish.
   Of greater concern to some is Smith's lack of experience in the
restaurant business. Pillsbury's restaurant unit, which also
includes Steak & Ale and Bennigan's, accounts for nearly half of
the company's total revenue.
   In the fiscal year ended May 31, restaurant sales slipped 5
percent as Burger King continued losing market share to rival
McDonald's Corp. despite a $200 million advertising campaign.
   ``Pillsbury's weakness has been more related to restaurants, and
if they got a guru in restaurants, they may have been better off,''
said Edward Froelich, an analyst at Pershing & Co.
   Echoing those concerns, Pillsbury stock fell $1.75 a share to
$35.12{ Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   But Smith is confident he can transfer his management skills to
a new industry.
   In a telephone interview, he said: ``I feel I have a very good
understanding of the operating fundamentals in the restaurant
business. I'm going to have an opportunity first hand to test
whether my judgments about what's important are right or not.''
   Smith follows in the footsteps of the hard-charging William H.
Spoor, who returned from retirement to run Pillsbury on an acting
basis nearly five months ago when former chairman John Stafford
resigned under pressure.
   Analysts have criticized Pillsbury, saying it lacked clear and
vital leadership in recent years.
   Its after-tax profit plummeted 62 percent in fiscal 1988 to
$69.3 million on sales of $6.2 billion, largely because of a
restructuring charge associated with the sale of its Godfather's
Pizza chain and a number of other restaurant operations and
consolidations.
   General Foods' performance under Smith is not immune to
criticism, either, some analysts say.
   Smith, a 22-year veteran of General Foods, counters that between
1984 and 1987, General Foods' growth rate went from ``relatively
flat to the point where we're growing better than 3 percent a
year.''
   As for management style, Smith said he typically tries to
``determine what the basic direction is we should be going and then
in a very aggressive and determined kind of way provide clear
direction to the organization and insist on commitment and
dedication.''
   Despite speculation on Wall Street, analysts are divided as to
how attractive a takeover candidate Pillsbury may be. Carnes, for
instance, said Pillsbury had ``too many wrecks in the ditch right
now.''
   Some experts have estimated the Burger King chain could fetch as
much as $1.5 billion if it were spun off as a separate company, but
Carnes said the chain would bring only about $900 million because
it was at least two years away from a turnaround.
   Smith said he would be surprised if selling Burger King ``made
any sense.''
   ``It has been very successful in the past, and I have to believe
there is room for a strong No. 2'' in the fast-food hamburger
business, he said.

<HEAD>Domestic Car And Truck Sales Rise 5 Percent In Mid-July</HEAD>

   Auto sales probably will continue at mid-July's
uneventful rate or slower through August and until the end of the
car model year, according to one industry analyst.
   Combined U.S. sales of domestically built cars and light trucks
rose 5 percent on a daily basis July 11-20 from the comparable
period of 1987, to 349,263 from 295,755, automakers reported Monday.
   There were nine selling days in this year's period and eight
last year.
   Sales moved at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.8 million,
trailing rates that frequently topped 8 million in the first half
of the year, but closer to the 7.7 million rate of mid-July 1987.
   Last August, dealers used buyer incentives to clear excess cars
from their crowded lots. After a hot-selling first half of 1988,
auto inventories are low, analyst Chris Cedergren said Monday.
   ``This year they won't need the fire sale approach,'' said
Cedergren, of J.D. Power & Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif.
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported increases in daily
car sales from July 11-20, offsetting a slight decline in General
Motors Corp. car sales.
   GM sold 106,791 cars in the nine-day period, up from 96,746 in
eight days of the comparable period last year. Daily sales were
down 1.9 percent.
   Ford sold 69,039 cars, up from 55,686 a year earlier, a 10.2
percent increase in daily sales. Chrysler sold 29,956 cars, up from
24,037, a 10.8 percent daily increase.
   GM sold 53,434 light trucks, up 7.7 percent on a daily sales
basis, and Chrysler sold 29,172, up 9.8 percent. Ford sold 45,426
light trucks, with the daily sales rate down 0.8 percent.
   ``It is an indication that finally sales are beginning to slow
down to more of a normal pace. It's a slight slowdown in the
marketplace, but still a pretty healthy rate,'' Cedergren said.
   Erratic sales last year exaggerate fluctuations among
manufacturers from 10-day period to period, he said. ``It all
depends who had incentive programs going last year and who has them
this year.''
   Overall, he said GM, with 49 percent of the market in
domestically made cars, has halted an erosion in its market share.
   Ford, with 31.7 percent, and Chrysler, with 13.7 percent, have
shown slight gains, partly at the expense of imports facing price
disadvantages because of changing exchange rates, Cedergren said.
   Sales of imported cars and trucks are reported at the end of
each month.
   Honda Motor Co. sold 6,344 of its U.S.-made cars in the mid-July
period, up from 5,469, a 3.1 percent daily sales gain. Nissan had a
0.6 percent gain, selling 3,376 U.S.-made cars, up from 2,984 a
year earlier.
   Toyota sold 1,745 domestically produced autos, up from 874 in a
period when its plant wasn't fully operational a year earlier.
   Mazda sold 690 U.S.-made cars. It did not begin domestic
manufacturing until September 1987.

   Here are sales results for the seven major U.S.
automakers for July 11-20.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and eight last
year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Crysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.
