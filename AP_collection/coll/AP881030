<HEAD>Bush Moves Uneasily Toward Electoral Triumph as Dukakis Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is the overwhelming yet uneasy
leader in the race for the White House as the presidential campaign
enters its final week, with Michael Dukakis making late gains that
have Democrats dreaming of a comeback, according to an Associated
Press survey of the 50 states.
   The survey shows Bush leading in states with 359 electoral
votes, even though he has not yet locked up the 270 that would
assure him of victory. Dukakis' total is far smaller _ 78 votes.
Nine states with 101 electoral votes are tossups, Illinois,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin among them.
   The AP survey indicates Bush has maintained Republican strength
in the South and Rocky Mountain West, while Dukakis has failed to
accomplish the same in the industrial states. The survey was based
on polls as well as interviews with politicians and political
analysts around the country.
   ``We're spending all our time in states that should be his
(Dukakis') base ... and he's spending none of his time in states
that should be our base,'' says top Bush strategist Lee Atwater.
``That's a campaign manager's dream.''
   Yet Democrats said a late-campaign surge has brought Dukakis to
within striking distance in states such as California, Ohio and
Texas, and said he has gained elsewhere, as well.
   ``Dukakis is clearly behind. But I think he's closing the gap,''
said Michigan Sen. Don Riegle. ``There's still a lot of people who
haven't made up their minds.'' Riegle is expected to win an easy
re-election himself, and says, ``I think the Democrats can still
win nationally.''
   The candidates will spend much of the final nine days in states
such as California, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania and
Ohio, and Atwater claimed, ``If we win any one of them George Bush
will be elected.''
   That assumes Bush holds Texas, where Democratic vice
presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen is camping out in hopes of a
home-state upset.
   Democrats in several key states say Dukakis' more aggressive
late-campaign style presents opportunities for a turnaround, and
has given lifelong Democrats a reason to take a second look at the
race. ``There's a lot of movement out there,'' said Francis
O'Brien, an adviser to the Massachusetts governor.
   Republicans and Democrats alike say Bush forged his lead on his
ability to depict Dukakis as an unreconstructed liberal. Dukakis'
recent improvement is attested to by private polling in both
parties, and laid in part to Dukakis' recent populist campaigning
and perhaps a process of loyal Democrats ``coming home'' as the
Nov. 8 election approaches.
   In television interviews last week, Dukakis attempted to portray
his views and his values while lambasting Bush and the Republicans
for distorting his record as governor of Massachusetts. Bush
confidently turned down network interview requests before agreeing
to appear on morning talk shows this week.
   ``What Michael Dukakis failed to do after the (Democratic)
convention was define who he is and what he was going to do,'' said
Pat Shea, co-chairman of the Democratic campaign in Utah.
   ``The thing I fear most is complacency,'' said Keith McNamara,
Bush's chairman in Ohio, a key state where Republicans have poured
resources and staked Bush to a lead.
   Several nationwide polls, including recent private soundings for
both campaigns, give Bush a national advantage in the range of
eight to 10 points. But when translated to the Electoral College,
Bush's advantage grows.
   The AP survey showed that Bush has built a solid core of support
in the customarily Republican regions of the South and Rocky
Mountain West. His lead in states such as Arizona, Florida and
Nevada could be as high as 20 to 30 points.
   Bush also leads in several key battleground states _ including
Ohio, Texas, California, New Jersey and Michigan _ but party
surveys over the past several days suggest nationwide gains for
Dukakis.
   Other key states are tossups, including Illinois, Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania, Missouri, Vermont, Oregon, Washington and Montana.
   Among more traditionally Democratic states, Maryland is tilting
in Bush's favor. Dukakis appears to have a solid lead in home-state
Massachusetts, although his campaign has decided to air radio
advertisements to firm up his support. He also is rated the narrow
favorite in Democratic New York and in Republican Iowa.
   Despite the improvement, the AP survey indicated that Dukakis
has failed to establish anything resembling a solid Democratic core
of support, and state after state that appeared strong for him
during the summer and early fall has moved into or closer to Bush's
column.
   ``I know Bush has got the inside track right now and I don't
know if we can turn that around or not,'' said Kentucky House
Speaker Don Blandford.
   Bush is running extremely strong in the South.
   ``It's well over,'' University of Virginia political analyst
Larry Sabato said in words describing his own state but which also
apply to the region.
   ``The Reagan Democrats have become Bush Democrats,'' said
Louisiana pollster Susan Howell. ``Unless Dukakis and the Louisiana
Democrats can call the Bush Democrats home in the last week,
Louisiana will be won for the Republicans by white Democrats voting
for George Bush.''
   By region:
   _ Bush has been leading in California, the nation's biggest
state with 47 electoral votes, although there as elsewhere
Democrats claim late gains and a formidable organization designed
to maximize their vote.
   Oregon and Washington are tossups while the remainder of the
West is in Bush's column, according to the survey. However, Bush
visited Montana and South Dakota last week in a bid to protect them
from the Democrats, and Dukakis appears to have closed the gap in
Colorado.
   _ In the Midwest, Iowa and Minnesota are leaning in Dukakis'
direction, but are far from secure, while the Democrat has lost his
edge in Wisconsin, now a tossup. Bush is highly favored in the
remainder of the farm belt.
   The industrial Midwest includes states that figured to decide a
close election. Bush's lead has narrowed in Ohio, where Democratic
chairman James Ruvolo insisted last week Dukakis had a chance to
win. The vice president also leads in Michigan.
   Illinois is close, while Missouri _ the weakest state for Bush
in his Super Tuesday primary sweep _ is a tossup.
   _ The Northeast, traditionally a strong Democratic region, has
the most close races, providing a good barometer on how well Bush
has carried the fight. New York aside, both sides claim an
advantage in Pennsylvania.
   Dukakis' home region of New England may even prove to be a land
of opportunity for Bush, according to the survey. He is regarded as
the prohibitive favorite in New Hampshire, and appears to be
leading in Connecticut and Maine.
   Vermont is rated a tossup and Democrats say they will carry
Rhode Island even though recent polls produce contradictory results.

<HEAD>Moynihan Coasting in Senate Race Against Little-Known Republican</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan isn't running for
re-election. He's walking.
   The New York Democrat is far ahead in the polls, has campaign
money to burn and is facing little-known lawyer Robert McMillan,
who has bare-bones support from his own Republican Party.
   If Moynihan is worried about anything in this campaign, it's
breaking the record he set when he ran in 1982. That year, running
against Florence Sullivan, a Brooklyn assemblywoman, Moynihan
carried 50 of New York's 62 counties, the first Democrat to do so
since Martin Van Buren.
   ``I lost Orleans County by just six votes,'' he said recently,
still sounding galled.
   Indeed, Moynihan hasn't had a bruising campaign since the 1976
Democratic primary when he went head-to-hat with Bella Abzug, whom
he beat by 10,000 votes out of 916,000 cast.
   Ask Moynihan today what he thinks of McMillan, and he says,
``Which one?''
   At first, you think he's kidding. Then he reaches into his back
pocket and pulls out his wallet, which contains a laminated card on
which are typed the names of the six candidates running for his
seat. Among them is a James P. McMillen, the candidate of the
Libertarian Party. The others are running on even more obscure
lines, ranging from the Independent Progressive to the Workers
World parties.
   Asked again what he thinks of Bob McMillan, Moynihan says only,
``He's running a very negative campaign.''
   McMillan has called Moynihan a liar and incompetent, accused him
of being a lousy boss who presides over a chaotic office, and
charged that the senator's morals are ``mixed up.'' Moynihan's
response has been no response at all, a sober tactic he credits to
his wife, Elizabeth, who is running his campaign.
   Moynihan heads into the final week of the campaign with a
seemingly unassailable lead in the polls as he seeks a third term
in Congress. A survey released last week by the Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion showed Moynihan ahead 67 percent to 20
percent with 13 percent undecided.
   ``His campaign is just the untouchable campaign,'' said campaign
spokesman Lawrence O'Donnell Jr. ``There are several campaigns like
that around the country and his is one. It can't be hurt by
anything.''
   Moynihan's overwhelming advantage has been virtually unchanged
for months as McMillan's underfunded and underpublicized campaign
has never really gotten on track.
   ``Where do we stand? We stand still under that heavy rock we've
been pushing uphill for the past several months,'' McMillan
campaign spokesman Robert Allen said. ``We've got only one way to
go _ that's up.''

   Vice President George Bush has maintained a
steady lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis, according to a report of
a Time-Yankelovich Clancy Shulman poll.
   The poll results, scheduled to be published by Time magazine
Monday and printed in early Sunday editions of The New York Times,
showed Bush leading Dukakis by 50 percent to 40 percent.
   The poll was based on telephone interviews with 1,096 probable
voters across the country on Tuesday and Wednesday and had a margin
of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   The results were similar to a Time-Yankelovich Clancy Shulman
poll conducted Sept. 27 and Sept. 28, which showed the Republican
ticket leading by 48 percent to 41 percent.

   Rebels ambushed a bus near the Honduran
border Saturday and killed nine people, including two children and a
pregnant woman, the Defense Ministry reported.
   A brief communique said a Sandinista army official was also among
the dead and three civilians were wounded in the attack.
   It said 20 rebels, known as Contras, opened fire on the bus at
9:30 a.m. about 10 miles northeast of San Juan del Rio Coco in the
northern province of Madriz.
   The report gave no additional details but other communiques said
three Sandinista soldiers were killed in two rebel attacks and
accused Honduran troops of firing at Nicaraguan army positions.
   A Third Army bulletin said Honduran troops fired machine guns and
mortar shells at Sandinista positions in Murupuchi, 140 miles north
of Managua and close to the border with Honduras.
   It did not mention any casualties but said that ``during October,
Honduran troops have attacked military border installations on 21
occasions.''
   The other reports said three soldiers were killed in two ambushes
by rebels in Jinotega province more than 100 miles notheast of
Managua. No details were given and the communiques did not mention
rebel casualties.

   Two lawyers for a black teen-ager who claimed she
was raped by six white men were released Saturday and the girl's
adviser and aunt pleaded innocent to misdemeanor charges stemming
from a courtroom brawl.
   Seventeen people were arrested after the scuffle broke out Friday
at Brooklyn Criminal Court. Sixteen court officers and two
demonstrators sustained minor injuries.
   The incident occurred after the Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York
black activist who is advising Tawana Brawley, and several
co-defendants and supporters refused to leave the courtroom
following a hearing on contempt charges stemming from a Sept. 29
demonstration.
   At the hearing, Criminal Court Judge Michael Nadel denied a
motion from Sharpton's lawyer to dismiss charges, despite a threat
that the group would refuse to leave the room unless he granted it.
   The Sept. 29 demonstration, which tied up traffic in violation of
a court order, was organized to protest a grand jury finding that
Miss Brawley had made up her story of abduction and rape.
   Attorneys William Kunstler and C. Vernon Mason and five others
were released Saturday.
   ``At this point, we have deferred prosecution pending a further
investigation,'' said Glenn Goldberg, spokesman for District
Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman.
   Sharpton, Juanita Brawley and eight others pleaded innocent late
Saturday to a variety of misdemeanor charges, Goldberg said.
   All except Ms. Brawley, the teen-ager's aunt, were released on
their own recognizance at the arraignment before Criminal Court
Judge Stephen Fisher, Goldberg said. Ms. Brawley was ordered held on
$1,500 bond or $250 cash, he added. The next court date was set for
Nov. 17.
   Sharpton faced charges of unlawful assembly and third-degree
criminal trespass, said Goldberg. Juanita Brawley faced charges of
criminal impersonation for allegedly giving a false name to police,
he said.
   The other eight faced charges including disorderly conduct,
harassment, third-degree attempted assault and resisting arrest.

Papers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 5 grafs after pvs 9th graf bgng ``It concluded: ...''
to add endorsements from three additional newspapers.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Times and the Star Tribune of Minneapolis endorsed
Democrat Michael Dukakis for president in their Sunday editions
while Republican George Bush picked up support from the Denver Post
and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
   The St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch, meanwhile, endorsed
both candidates, saying its editorial board was divided on which
would make the better president.
   The Times said the most urgent job for the next president will be
``getting America out of hock'' from the Reagan administration
deficits.
   ``Who's likely to do it better? The answer tips a closely
balanced scale _ to Michael Dukakis,'' the New York newspaper said.
   It credited the vice president with being the ``clear winner'' as
far as running an effective campaign. But in evaluating the
candidates' experience and personality, it said Bush's selection of
Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as a running mate was ``a blunder that,
for this test, forces a clear preference for Mr. Dukakis.''
   On the issues, the Times said Bush ``merits the edge'' on foreign
policy questions while Dukakis ``at least recognizes that national
security depends on economic strength.''
   The New York newspaper said both candidates are better men than
the images that have been projected in a ``sour, superficial,
misleading campaign'' and that ``America is likely to be well served
if either man is elected.''
   The Denver paper complained that both Bush and Dukakis were
``presenting their worst faces to the American people.''
   It concluded: ``Americans are forced to choose between two good
men running two bad campaigns. After wiping away the mud from both
candidates, The Post believes George Bush is the better choice.''
   Despite saying its enthusiasm for the Democratic candidate had
waned during the campaign, the Philadelphia Inquirer endorsed
Dukakis.
   ``Mr. Dukakis' shortcomings as a campaigner, to be sure, raise
legitimate concerns about his ability to inspire people as
president, which is why our enthusiasm has waned,'' the paper said
in Sunday's editions. ``Even so, on the basis of who he is, what
he's done and where he's likely to lead us, Mr. Dukakis remains the
better bet.''
   Meawhile Bush picked up backing from the Detroit News.
   ``He may not be an ideal candidate, but in our opinion, he's far
and away the better of the two,'' the newspaper said.
   The Sunday Oregonian of Portland, Ore., the state's largest
newspaper, also backed the GOP nominee.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote of the vice president:
``While we disagree with a number of George Bush's approaches to
national problems, we believe him to be an intelligent and competent
man who will work diligently on behalf of the nation's most vital
interests.''
   It said the high point of the Dukakis campaign was the Democratic
nominee's acceptance speech in Atlanta in July, but ``since then it
has been mostly downhill.''
   The Star Tribune headlined its endorsement, ``For president:
narrowly, Michael Dukakis.''
   The editorial said ``questions about the presidential qualities
of each candidate have grown. Voters are left to guess which, if
elected, could provide better answers over the long run. Our guess
is Michael Dukakis.''
   The St. Paul paper, meanwhile, said that contributing to the
dilemma of its divided eight-member editorial board ``was a sense of
profound disgust about the negative tone of this campaign.''
   ``It's not that both George Bush and Michael Dukakis are
unacceptable,'' the Pioneer Press Dispatch said. ``What is closer to
the truth is that we find ourselves divided on who would make the
better president.''
   Also Sunday, Kentucky's two largest papers, The Courier-Journal
of Louisville and the Lexington Herald-Leader, endorsed Dukakis. In
Florida, the Orlando Sentinel and the Miami Herald endorsed Bush
while The Daytona Beach News-Journal praised Dukakis.

<TEXT>
   English furniture, oil paintings and other
furnishings reportedly belonging to Claus and Sunny von Bulow sold
for a total of $11.56 million in a two-day auction that ended
Saturday, Sotheby's reported.
   Nearly 500 people filled the auction room for Saturday's session
to bid on everything from Old Master paintings to silver and rugs.
Sotheby's had estimated the sale would fetch between $6 million and
$7.5 million.
   On Saturday alone, bidders put up $6,718,350, establishing a new
record for any auction of English furniture, said George Read,
director of the English Furniture Department at Sotheby's.
   ``This auction was a classic example of a great collection
achieving remarkable prices,'' he said in a statement.
   For example, the largest group of Samuel Dixon embossed paper
bird pictures, circa 1750, sold for $630,100, exceeding the high
estimate by more than $500,000.
   An anonymous American dealer bought a rare George III rosewood
commode for $880,000. It was expected to bring about $500,000.
   In all, 93 percent of the items offered were sold.
   The auction had been advertised merely as ``Property from a
Private Collection,'' but The New York Times reported that the
material belonged to the von Bulows.
   Claus von Bulow has been living in Europe since he was acquitted
in 1985 in a retrial of charges that he twice tried to murder his
wife with insulin injections. Mrs. von Bulow has been in an
irreversible coma since suffering a seizure eight years ago.
   The offerings were said to include furnishings from Clarendon
Court, the von Bulows' mansion in Newport, R.I., and pieces from the
couple's Manhattan apartment.

<HEAD>Hirohito Loses Large Amount Of Blood, Given Emergency Transfusion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito discharged the largest amount of
blood through the night since he fell ill last month, forcing
doctors to administer an emergency transfusion, a palace spokesman
said Sunday.
   The 87-year-old emperor suffered his largest discharge since
falling ill and received 2.94 pints of blood in a single emergency
transfusion lasting until Sunday morning, Kenji Maeda, Imperial
Household Agency spokesman, told reporters.
   ``What we had feared occurred,'' Maeda quoted chief court
physician Akira Takagi as saying. But he added that doctors were
able to deal with the crisis and had returned to normal procedures.
   Maeda did not say how much blood the monarch lost, but the
discharge and transfusion are the largest since the ailing monarch
vomited blood Sept. 19 and was given 0.86 pints immediately after.
   Maeda said the emperor began bleeding from his bowels at about 9
p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) Saturday, but that as of 10 a.m. Sunday (9 p.m.
EDT Saturday), the discharges subsided. He added that the emperor's
systolic blood pressure plummeted to less than 100 ``for a short
time,'' but that Hirohito was not in shock and remains conscious.
   By Sunday morning the emperor was awake and resting, Maeda said.
   The transfusions brought the total amount of blood Hirohito has
received in the 42 days that he has been bedridden to 30.7 pints.
   Maeda also said palace doctors believed that along with blood
which had accumulated in Hirohito's abdomen, some of the discharge
was from fresh internal bleeding from the area of the upper
intestine, where he underwent bypass surgery last year.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports
that the emperor has cancer.
   Hirohito, the world's oldest living monarch, is being fed
intravenously and has not eaten any food except for a few spoonfuls
of porridge since the onset of the crisis.

   Police combed the streets of the city's south
side Saturday in the second night of a weekend sweep aimed at
curbing rampant gang violence and drug dealing, officials said.
   The 200-member anti-gang task force made 156 arrests the previous
night, including 98 suspected gang members, Officer Richard
Dulgerian said. They also seized 21 vehicles and four guns, he said.
   Twenty-five adults and seven juveniles were arrested for
felonies, Dulgerian said.
   Other arrests involved driving under the influence, curfew
violations and outstanding misdemeanor warrants. Officers issued 171
traffic citations and conducted 583 field interviews during the
night.
   The police sweeps began earlier this year following a Good Friday
shooting in which one person was killed and 12 were injured. Police
Chief Daryl Gates vowed to crack down on gangs and keep city streets
safe for residents.
   ``The mission of the task force is to seek out and arrest gang
members for any violation of the law, to serve as a reassurance to
the citizens of South Central L.A. and to fulfill Chief Gates'
commitment to eliminate gang activity in the city of L.A.,'' said
Officer Don Lawrence, a department spokesman.

   Former Philippines first lady Imelda
Marcos arrived here Saturday night for a brief stopover on her way
to New York, where she is scheduled to be arraigned on racketeering
charges.
   The private jet carrying Mrs. Marcos landed at 9:55 p.m. PDT at
the San Jose Jet Center, a facility for private aircraft at the San
Jose International Airport.
   Mrs. Marcos disembarked and was led away by a police motorcade to
an undisclosed location. Earlier, government officials said they
expected Mrs. Marcos to visit her daughter, Irene Araneta, in San
Francisco.
   The jet was being refueled and was scheduled to depart at 3 a.m.
PST Sunday, officials at the jet center said.
   Earlier Saturday in Honolulu, Mrs. Marcos had invited federal
officials to join her on the borrowed luxury jet to prove she would
not flee rather than fly to New York for arraignment on racketeering
charges.
   Mrs. Marcos arrived at the Honolulu airport in a black limousine
and got aboard the plane without any comment to reporters. She was
accompanied by an entourage of about 10 people.
   Before leaving for the airport, Mrs. Marcos kissed and hugged her
husband, former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, who was
brought out of the couple's hillside estate in a wheelchair.
   Both were seen wiping away tears in the parting that was video
recorded by Marcos aides.
   ``There are rumors that once airborne and out of radar range, I
might flee out of the United States,'' Mrs. Marcos said in a
statement issued late Friday. ``In order to assure everybody of our
destination, I am inviting the FBI, Federal Aviation Administration
and the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) to have their
men accompany us in the plane.''
   But a U.S. attorney said the government trusted her to appear for
Monday's hearing.
   John Bartko, a Marcos attorney, flew to Honolulu early Saturday
so he would be with Mrs. Marcos for her first trip out of Hawaii
since being exiled here nearly three years ago.
   ``That's why I came, so we could do everything to assure the U.S.
government she will be there,'' Bartko said. ``Any apprehension
about her not meeting her legal obligation is totally unfounded.''
   Mrs. Marcos and her husband were indicted Oct. 21 on charges that
they looted more than $100 million from their country and used it to
buy New York real estate, artwork and other objects.
   Defense lawyers persuaded U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan that
Marcos, 71, was too frail to make the long flight. His arraignment
was postponed at least until a government physician examines him.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after a military-civilian
revolt catapulted Corazon Aquino to power, ending Marcos' 20-year
rule.
   Defense lawyers said Mrs. Marcos, 59, would plead innocent.
   U.S. Attorney Dan Bent said no federal officials would escort
Mrs. Marcos on the private Boeing 737-300, in a luxury configuation
for just 19 passengers, that tobacco heiress Doris Duke loaned for
the 5,000-mile trip.
   ``Until she does otherwise, we must assume Mrs. Marcos will
appear as summoned,'' Bent said. He refused to say how prosecutors
would ensure her plane would not stray.
   In New York, suites were booked at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for
the Marcos entourage, which includes a nurse, secretary, lawyers and
several friends, Trinidad said.
   ``I am grateful to the members of the Filipino-American community
in New York and surrounding areas for their concern for my privacy
and security,'' said Mrs Marcos. ``At the same time, they insist I
stay at the Waldorf Astoria at their own expense. To all of them, a
million thanks.''
   Although Marcos aides refused to detail Mrs. Marcos' plans in New
York, an associate said she planned to shop and entertain old
friends.
   As Philippine first lady, Mrs. Marcos was known for her lavish
parties at the Waldorf and elsewhere in New York City, but Bartko
said she now has other concerns.
   ``Her real concern is that she also hasn't left her husband's
side for three years and she's very concerned about his health,''
Bartko said. ``She's going to meet her legal obligation, but I just
don't see her having a gay old time in New York City.''
   Indicted with the Marcoses was Saudian Arabian financier Adnan
Khashoggi, who is accused of acting as a front for Marcos to help
divert assets and hide his ownership of real estate and art. No
court date for his appearance was scheduled.

   A private jet carrying two-time Oscar winning
actress Sally Field and her family aborted takeoff and ran into two
parked jets Saturday, but only minor injuries were reported,
authorities said.
   Field, 41, was en route to Burbank, Calif., with her husband,
film producer Alan Greisman, 41, her 11-month-old son, Sam, and her
mother, Margaret O'Mahoney, said Pitkin County sheriff's spokesman
Steve Crockett.
   The Challenger jet, belonging to entertainer Merv Griffin,
aborted takeoff about 2 p.m., and ran into two private jets parked
on a ramp at the county airport, Crockett said.
   The jet lost power as it tried to take off, never left the ground
and veered to the right, said Jeff Lumsden of the sheriff's office.
   ``The plane skidded across a grass infield and struck two parked
jets, ripping the nose gear out of one jet, a G-2, and coming to
rest in the middle of the second jet, which is a Jet Star, pushing
it back to the fence,'' said Crockett.
   The jet had flown to Aspen after taking Griffin and actress Eva
Gabor to Griffin's Monterey, Calif., ranch earlier Saturday, said
Warren Cowan, a publicist for both Griffin and Gabor.
   The jets hit by Griffin's plane belong to entertainment
personality Burt Sugarman and Marty Raynes, the son-in-law of oilman
Marvin Davis, said Cowan.
   ``According to Merv, his plane and maybe the others have been
totaled,'' the publicist said.
   Field, who won Academy Awards for her performances in ``Norma
Rae'' and ``Places in the Heart'' and whose latest film is
``Punchline,'' later departed with her family on a commercial flight
to Denver, Crockett said. She and her husband own a home overlooking
this mountain resort town.
   The pilot and co-pilot were treated for cuts and bruises at Aspen
Valley Hospital, Crockett said. A flight attendant was not injured.
   Landings and takeoffs were delayed for 15 minutes until fuel
spilled in the accident was mopped up. Crockett said National
Transportation Safety Board investigators would look into the
incident.

<TEXT>
   Doctors administered another emergency blood
transfusion to Emperor Hirohito on Sunday evening to battle an
alarming drop in his blood pressure, a palace spokesman said.
   After the transfusion, Hirohito's blood pressure rose to 120
over 50 from the dangerously low 84 over 34 level in the early
evening, the spokesman said.
   A systolic blood pressure of under 100 for a sustained period of
time can cause permanent brain damage.
   The latest transfusion raised to 31.54 pints the amount of blood
Hirohito has received since he fell ill last month.
   The Imperial Household Agency spokesman, Kenji Maeda, told
reporters that doctors administered the transfusion to battle the
drop in blood pressure.
   He quoted doctors as saying Hirohito's condition improved after
the transfusion and that the 87-year-old monarch was conscious.
Maeda would not say whether the emperor was in critical condition.
   The blood pressure reading of 84 over 34 was the lowest reported
by the palace since Hirohito became ill 42 days ago.
   The emperor's blood pressure dropped to that level after he lost
a large amount of blood in his bowels on Saturday night and Sunday
morning.
   Hirohito, the world's oldest living monarch, is being fed
intravenously and has eaten little solid food since the onset of
the crisis.
   Palace officials refuse to comment on reports that the emperor
has cancer.

   Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos
was greeted here Sunday by about 40 supporters, who said
racketeering charges filed against her and Ferdinand Marcos
represented a betrayal by the U.S. government.
   Mrs. Marcos, who landed in a private jet away from reporters'
and supporters' views, immediately left for New York City, where
she is scheduled to be arraigned Monday on charges she and her
husband looted more than $100 million from the Philippines.
   It was the first time Mrs. Marcos had left Hawaii since she and

   The locusts were found in Plymouth, Truro and the Isles of

<TEXT>
   More than 13,000 brides and grooms in
the Unification Church were married Sunday in a mass wedding
complete with matching bridal gowns and bouquets, a day after the
couples were introduced.
   The ceremony matched 6,516 couples, 4,000 of them Japanese
marrying Japanese and the remainder marriages between people from
the United States and more than a dozen other nations.
   Many couples did not speak the same language.
   The Rev. Sun Myung Moon, founder of the South Korean-based
church, matched the couples personally, a church spokesman said,
and purposely chose to unite more than 2,000 Japanese and Koreans
``to heal and spiritually cleanse bad feelings left over from the
Japanese colonial rule of Korea.''
   Moon told the newlyweds: ``You will overcome international
barriers to create one world of the heart and a blessed race for
the future.''
   In unison, the grooms lifted the veils of the brides and the
brides and grooms took identifical gold rings from small silk
pouches to place on each other's fingers.
   There was no kiss. The couples are counseled to live together 40
days without sharing the same bed.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, reported that South Korean
hotels were complaining they had no business from the wedding.
   ``The church feels a marriage is not just for personal physical
satisfaction,'' explained Bernard Quandt, of Bad-Kreuznach, West
Germany. Quandt was matched to a Korean woman and married in a mass
wedding in 1982.
   This was the first mass wedding by the church since the 1982
ceremony, when about 6,000 couples were united. Only a few smaller
group weddings have been held since, said Quandt, a teacher in the
church seminary.
   The ceremony was held in a giant warehouse of a church-owned
soft drink plant at Yong-in village, south of Seoul. The words of
speakers were translated into Korean and Japanese.
   Ruka Nun-ira, a 31-year-old from Ghana, married Kurokawa Akemi
from Japan. He said they will live in Seoul where he is attending
school.
   Ruka isn't concerned they cannot communicate much, except in
smiles. He said he ``made a choice and I trust the church. We'll
figure it out.''

   A grandstand erected for a variety

   The cause of the accident Saturday night in this city 200 miles
southeast of Paris was not immediately known. Investigators said
they were not sure if the stand had been overloaded or improperly
set up.
   About 20 people were admitted to local hospitals for treatment
of broken bones and severe bruises. None was in serious condition.
Another 55 were treated at the hospital in Le Creusot and released.
   About 3,000 people attended the show at Jean Garnier stadium,
where two grandstands were built. One of the temporary grandstands
collapsed about 10 p.m., before the appearance of singer Julie
Pietri, the main attraction. The show was stopped after the
accident, police said.

   FBI agents have arrested a fugitive
accused of being the so-called ``gentleman bandit'' who robbed 38
banks in four states.
   Robert Hal Brame, 34, was arrested Friday evening after eight
agents wrestled the armed man to the ground outside his
girlfriend's apartment, the FBI said.
   Brame had told his girlfriend that he would never be taken
alive, said Terry Knowles, special agent in charge of the FBI's
Sacramento office.
   He escaped two years ago from the Durham Penitentiary in North
Carolina where he was serving an 18-year sentence for kidnapping,
attempted murder and assault on a law enforcement officer.
   Brame was arrested on suspicion of robbing seven banks in
Florida, Arkansas and California, Knowles said. In all, he has been
identified as a suspect in 38 robberies in those states and
Georgia, Knowles said.
   ``There has been some consideration to putting him on the 10
Most Wanted list,'' Knowles said.
   The ``gentleman bandit'' earned his nickname because he usually
wore a three-piece business suit, he said.
   The FBI had suspected that Brame was in Sacramento for about a
month, Knowles said. Agents had been watching the homes of
relatives and his girlfriend, whom Knowles declined to identify.

   Elvis Presley's mansion, Graceland, will
be decked out for the holidays with a $500,000 display including
40,000 lights and a 60-foot tree.
   Graceland operators say they hope the display will become a
regional attraction. It will run from Nov. 25 through Christmas
Eve, project designer John Brandano of Syracuse, N.Y., said last
week.
   Organizers began with Presley's own traditional life-size
Nativity scene and blue lights lining the driveway. They are adding
horse-drawn carriage rides around the mansion grounds, animated
characters, larger-than-life wire sculptures of Memphis attractions
covered in white lights, bands, singers and Santa Claus, of course.
   The project is expected to pay for itself within two years and
then generate enough profit for expansion, said Graceland executive
director Jack Soden.

   Cambridge University dons have voted
to eliminate sexist language from their historic rule book.
   They voted 348-260 on Friday night to end the use of male
pronouns to denote members of both sexes in the university's
Statutes and Ordinances.
   The dons _ heads, tutors and fellows of the colleges _ voted
that ``she,'' ``her,'' and ``herself'' be added to ``he,'' ``his,''
and ``himself'' entries in the book. A lobby of 92 academics led
the call for the change.
   Opponents argued that traditional language should not be changed
just to satisfy modern standards. They also objected to the cost of
amending the 1,152-page book, which may be as much as $17,600.
   There were no women at the university when the Statutes and
Ordinances was translated from the original Latin into English in
the 1850s. Women now account for nearly half of the university's
population.

   An Air Madagascar Boeing 747 carrying more

animal.
   Robert Weller, an Associated Press reporter who was aboard, said
the airliner blew tires when the pilot slammed on the brakes at
Nairobi's airport.
   He said the passengers left the aircraft and walked to the
airport terminal 100 yards away. Smoke was pouring from the brakes
on one of the wheels and fire trucks went out to the plane to cool
it down. No one appeared to be injured.
   Weller said crew members quoted the control tower as saying the
plane hit an animal, probably an impala. The Boeing had flown in
from Paris and was taking off for Antananarivo, capital of
Madagascar.

   Many British schoolteachers have trouble spelling,
can't do a simple sum and don't know West Germany's capital,
according to a survey published Sunday.
   The Sunday Times commissioned a general knowledge survey of 308
teachers in primary, junior high and high schools nationwide and
reported three-quarters of them could not spell ``embarrass,''
``satellite'' and ``harassment.''
   ``Almost all made mistakes over the 16 simple questions on
current affairs, geography, spelling, maths, science, history and
literature,'' said the weekly, which commissioned the telephone
survey from Market Opinion and Research International.
   ``The results of this survey would be laughable if they were not
so devastating,'' said Peter Dawson, general secretary of the
Professional Association of Teachers.
   The Sunday Times said a press officer at the Department of
Education also had difficulty spelling the three test words and
could not do the percentage question.
   The Sunday Times said the results of the survey might help
explain its poll two ago, which found that one in six British
adults could not find Britain on a map, half did not know how to
read a railway timetable and two-thirds could not spell
``embarrass.''
   One in five of the teachers surveyed did not know King John
signed the Magna Carta and 15 percent didn't know that ``The
Canterbury Tales'' was written by Geoffrey Chaucer, the father of
English poetry.
   Sixteen percent, including 22 of the 171 math and science
teachers queried, were unable to answer when asked: ``What is 15
percent of 10 pounds sterling?'' (answer: 1.50 pounds)
   Eleven percent of the teachers could not say how many
millimeters are in a meter (1,000) and one in 24 thought the Rev.
Ian Paisley, the militant and much publicized Northern Ireland
Protestant politician, was a Roman Catholic.
   One in five did not know Warsaw is the capital of Poland, 27
percent did not know that Bonn is the capital of West Germany, and
47 percent did not know that Kabul is the capital of Afghanistan.
Forty-two percent got all three capitals right.
   The reporter who wrote the story got everything right except the
one about the Magna Carta, traditionally regarded as the basis of
English liberties. He said he had no idea who signed it.

   Pope John Paul II has appointed a new
Vatican envoy to Cuba amid signs of improving relations between the
Roman Catholic Church and the Marxist nation.
   Monsignor Faustino Sainz Munoz, 51, a senior adviser on the
Vatican's Council for Public Affairs, was named Apostolic
Pro-Nuncio in Havana, according to a Vatican statement Saturday.
   He replaces Archbishop Giulio Einaudi, 60, who since August 1980
held the Havana post that has the diplomatic standing of an
ambassador.
   The Spanish-born Sainz Munoz entered the Vatican's diplomatic
service in 1970 and served in Senegal and Scandinavia. In 1983 he
joined the Council for Public Affairs, equivalent to the Holy See's
foreign ministry, and specialized in relations with Eastern Europe.
   During a visit to the Vatican by Cuban bishops in August, the
pope noted ``positive signs'' in church-state relations in Cuba but
said more needs to be done ``so the church can carry out its
evangelical mission freely and effectively.''
   Catholics account for about 40 percent of Cuba's 10.2 million
people.

   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci wound
up military talks with government officials Sunday on the first
part of his three-nation Middle East tour.
   Lower-ranking officials usually represent Washington at the
annual discussions of how the kingdom uses American military aid.
   ``The secretary wanted to come to Jordan to underscore to all
how important we consider our relations with Jordan,'' said a U.S.
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   This year, Jordan received about $26.5 million in U.S. military
grants and $1.8 million for training. The figures have dropped from
more than $100 million in credits and grants five years ago.
   Carlucci met Saturday with King Hussein and Sunday with Prime
Minister Zaid Rifai.
   Details of the talks were not made available.
   The U.S. defense chief was due in Egypt on Monday for talks with
government officials there. Israel will be the last stop on his
tour.

<HEAD>Woman Dies In Evacuation After Bombing of Police Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly woman died of a
heart attack while being evacuated from her home after a bomb
attack on a police station, police said Sunday.
   Four missiles were fired from launchers mounted on a truck at
the heavily fortified Royal Ulster Constabulary station in the
village of Roslea in County Fermanagh late Saturday night, but
police said they believe only two exploded.
   A police spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said there
were no injuries to police and the station, near the border with
the Irish Republic, appeared to be only slightly damaged.
   The woman, who was in her mid-70s, collapsed as she was being
evacuated from her house near the police station. She was not
identified.
   The area was sealed off Sunday as police checked for further
devices, and several families were not allowed to return home, the
spokesman said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion
fell on the Irish Republican Army which has carried out similar
attacks on police stations.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.
   Elsewhere, army explosives experts defused two large bombs in
Tyrone and Fermanagh.
   The biggest, with 700 pounds of homemade explosives, was found
on a road between Pomeroy and Stewartstown in Tyrone, police said.
The experts also found 330 yards of command wire, used by
terrorists to trigger bombs from a distance.
   The second device _ 200 pounds of explosives and shrapnel inside
two beer kegs _ was discovered on the Fermanagh-Donegal border at
Belleek with a command wire stretching for 385 yards, the spokesman
said.

   Randy Owen, lead singer for the country
band Alabama, remembers the poorer days of his boyhood when all his
family had to eat one winter was peas and okra.
   ``We grew a lot of gardens and crops,'' Owen, 38, said in a
recent interview. ``One story my mother always tells me is that one
year when I was small, all we had to eat was okra and peas. She'd
canned a whole bunch of that stuff, so all we ate for lunch and
dinner was okra and peas.
   ``We went to these people's house and they asked me what I
wanted to eat. I said, `Peas and okra.' That's all I'd had that
winter.''
   Owen said the hard times of his youth make him especially
grateful for the fans who pay to attend the band's road shows.
   ``Not a lot of rich people like country music,'' he said. ``As a
percentage, most of the people that come to our concerts are women
and, in a lot of cases, they're a single parent, trying to raise
their kids, going to college, holding down a job and living on the
very fringe.''

   The four members of Irish rock group U2
received the gold medal of the city of Madrid from Mayor Juan
Barranco in a ceremony before the premiere of their concert movie
``Rattle and Hum.''
   Barranco on Saturday praised the group's musical ability and
artistic sensibilities and described the medal as a ``symbol of the
gratitude and friendship of the people of Madrid, who are always
appreciative of altruistic causes.''
   The group arranged for proceeds from the premiere of the movie
at the Gran Via Theater to go to Amnesty International, the
London-based human rights group.
   U2's frontman and singer Bono told the mayor the group chose the
city as the site for the film premiere because ``Madrid is a very
open city, musically interesting, and we all feel very good when we
are in Madrid.''

   Actor and former professional
football player Charles ``Bubba'' Smith says acting is tougher than
tackling quarterbacks.
   ``Football has never been tough. No, I don't think it has
anything to do with size,'' Smith said. ``(Acting) is more of a
mental drain. You go through the same process _ in football you
remember the plays, in acting you remember your lines.''
   Smith, 43, is now working on ``Police Academy 6,'' after
starring in the original move and every sequel since.
   ``They told me they were going to do 10. I said `Please do,'''
said Smith, who also has done some beer commercials.
   The 6-foot-7 defensive end-turned-actor on Saturday returned to
his alma mater, Michigan State, which awarded him a plaque from the
school's sports Hall of Fame. Smith led Michigan to the Big Ten
football championship in 1965.
   ``You know I've been in Super Bowls, I've played in big games,
but nothing has stayed in my mind like college,'' Smith said. ``It
was the greatest time of my life. And most people, if they would
drop their ego, they would say the same thing. College is the last
time you can be away from home and not worry about bills.''

   A single Spitfire from the Battle of Britain
Memorial Flight flew over St. Clement Danes church Sunday as Queen
Mother Elizabeth unveiled a statue to World War II hero Lord
Dowding.
   Dowding, who died in 1970 at age 88, was commander in chief of
the Fighter Command throughout the Battle of Britain but was never
honored with an official statue.
   ``It is a matter of surprise and concern or perhaps even shame
that no memorial has been raised,'' said Air Chief Marshal Sir
Christopher Foxley-Norris, chairman of the Battle of Britain
Fighter Association.
   The statue, outside St. Clement Danes, the Royal Air Force
church on London's famed Strand, was paid for by many former pilots
and by a public appeal.
   ``But for his victory, the war would probably have been lost in
1940,'' Foxley-Norris said during the unveiling. ``If he had not
won his victory in 1940, there would be no other statues or
memorials in this capital city.''
   The 88-year-old mother of Queen Elizabeth II, whose late
husband, King George VI, had sought recognition for Dowding in
1942, agreed.
   ``He was a wartime leader to whom this country owes so much,''
she said as she unveiled the statue.

   The king of Bhutan will marry his four
wives in a public ceremony Monday, nine years after the union was
consecrated in a private ceremony, the government of the tiny
Himalayan kingdom announced.
   The marriage of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck to Ashi Dorji
Wangmo, Ashi Tshering Pem, Ashi Tshering Yandon and Ashi Sangye
Choden, all sisters, will take place at a Buddhist temple in
Punakha Dzong, the seat of the ancient capital of Bhutan, Foreign
Minister Dawa Tshering said Sunday in New Delhi.
   During the hourlong ceremony, the king's eldest son, 8-year-old
Prince Jigme Gesar Namgyal Wangchuck, will be formally designated
as heir to the throne.
   Only about 200 members of the royal family, senior Buddhist
lamas and monks have been invited, he said.
   ``This is a national event,'' Tshering said. ``I can't imagine
it would be of much interest to the outside world.''
   Bhutan, known as ``The Land of the Thunder Dragon,'' is a
picturesque mountainous country surrounded by India and China. The
government has tried in recent years to limit its 1.5 million
people to outside influence by imposing stiff tourist fees and
granting only about 2,500 visas a year.
   The 35-year-old king and his four wives, ranging in age from 23
to 29, were married in a simple, private Buddhist ceremony in 1979.
They have four sons and four daughters.

<HEAD>Study Praises Medical Response To West German Air Tragedy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military medical teams responded quickly and
professionally after the August air show tragedy at Ramstein Air
Base in West Germany, suggesting Pentagon efforts to improve
readiness are working, a study says.
   A study team reported the first Army Medevac helicopter landed
at the scene just four minutes after one of the Italian stunt team
jets cart wheeled into a crowd, a study team said.
   Within less than two hours, more than 270 victims had been
evacuated from the scene and were receiving medical care, the team
said in a report to Dr. William Mayer, assistant defense secretary
for health affairs.
   The accident occurred when three Italian jets collided during an
air show Aug. 28, and one of them plunged into the crowd and
exploded in flames. Sixty-nine people died either at the scene or
later as a result of injuries and burns. All three pilots were
among the dead.
   The study team lauded the medical response.
   ``To expect people to be suddenly faced with a mass casualty
event _ most for the first time in their lives _ and completely
clear a disaster scene within 96 minutes without any error is
humanly impossible,'' the team said.
   ``But we identified no instance where anyone was harmed by
negligence or error.''
   The study team also lauded West German medical professionals and
the manner in which American and German emergency teams worked
together, saying any difficulties that arose were minor and ``did
not affect the rescue effort.''
   The team said it was ``highly impressed by the professionalism
and effectiveness of the combined German and American response to
the disaster,'' and added, ``It appears the victims were managed
efficiently and effectively.''
   Army Lt. Col. Thomas Hawks, one of six officers ordered by Mayer
to study the air show disaster, said, ``Their performance was
phenomenal.''
   Last week, a special inquiry commission blamed the disaster on
pilot error. The collision occurred as the team's ``solo'' pilot
was trying to fly through a heart-shaped formation made by the
other two planes.
   ``The cause of the midair collision between the solo pilot and
two other planes from the Italian stunt flying team Frecce
Tricolori has been determined to have been human error by the solo
pilot,'' the report said.
   Mayer, who was recruited by former Defense Secretary Caspar W.
Weinberger to upgrade the military medical system, has worked for
several years to improve emergency response times and to deploy
more mobile and emergency medical gear in the field.
   He has demanded that commanders of medical detachments emphasize
``war-time readiness,'' not just the peacetime business of treating
servicemen and their dependents.
   By coincidence, the medical personnel assigned to the base
clinic at Ramstein had staged an emergency exercise just two months
before the disaster, working with an Army helicopter unit from the
nearby Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the study team found.
   Following those exercise procedures, the first casualties from
the air show were taken to the Ramstein clinic by ambulance. When
the clinic filled, about 70 patients were automatically sent by air
to Landstuhl, the team said.
   When Landstuhl filled, German authorities smoothly directed the
flow of patients to several civilian hospitals in the region, the
study said.
   ``We identified no significant mistakes in the medical
management of this crisis,'' the team concluded.

   Overweight and proud of it, members of the
National Association to Aid Fat Americans are holding their annual
Midwest conference and seeking to dispel the idea that pudgy people
can't be happy.
   The association's events include a full-sized fashion show, a
low-impact aerobics session, an indoor pool party, a hug therapy
session and a Halloween dance.
   ``I never met so many fantastic ladies who are happy with
themselves,'' said Lorrie Tabar, a Cleveland truck driver. She
ended a lifetime of dieting and joined the group last week after
seeing two spokeswomen on television.
   The founder of the association, William Fabrey, says
full-figured people should have the right to enjoy themselves
without being hassled about their waistlines.
   ``I felt there was crying need for some voice in the U.S. to say
that your worth is not measured by the size of your waistline,''
Fabrey said. ``It has been an uphill fight because we live in a
society that worships thinness.''
   ``People who wouldn't dream of joking about ethnic groups or
women think nothing of deriding fat people,'' said Sally E. Smith,
the group's executive director.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Halloween is Jayne Ware's time to
howl, so to speak, because it's about the only time of year she
finds a big audience for talk about her line of work: ghostbusting.
   The vanity license plate on her van says ``GHOSTBUS,'' and her
business card says ``Granny Ghostbuster'' alongside
`Parapsychologist.''
   For most of the year, Mrs. Ware says she does serious
investigation at the request of people who have ``unexplainable
happenings'' in their buildings.
   But around Halloween, ``people usually expect me to make a fun
thing out of it, so I go along with the idea,'' she said, laughing.
``These are about the only two weeks of the year I talk about
`ghosts.' The rest of the year, during research and for lecture
purposes, I prefer to call them `energies' or `vortexes.'''
   Monday night, she will be the most popular Halloween figure in
existence to her 2- and 5-year-old grandchildren, as ``Granny
Ghostbuster'' can tell spook stories to really make their hair
stand on end.
   ``It's like a vacation from the serious work. I take time to
enjoy the popular conception of ghosts and haunted houses,'' she
said.

   A bomb thrown by an unidentified man

Sunday but caused no injuries. Police blamed the attack on a
left-wing terrorist group.
   No one claimed responsibility, but the group, the Revolutionary

targets tax offices.
   The explosion Sunday damaged a two-story building where the tax
office is located, said a police spokesman who demanded anonymity.

   Doctors stabilized the vital signs of Emperor
Hirohito on Sunday after the ailing monarch's blood pressure fell
dangerously low, a palace spokesman said.
   Doctors gave the 87-year-old Hirohito nearly a pint more blood
Sunday after he received three pints overnight, spokesman Kenji
Maeda said.
   ``His fever, pulse and blood pressure indicate that his
condition warrants a certain amount of concern,'' Maeda quoted
chief palace physician Akira Takagi as saying.
   ``What we had feared occurred,'' Maeda quoted the doctor as
saying about Hirohito's huge loss of blood overnight. He did not
elaborate.
   He also did not say if the emperor's condition was critical.
Another palace official refused to comment.
   Since Hirohito fell ill Sept. 19, he has received 31.5 pints of
blood, about three times the normal amount in his body.
   The weekend transfusions were the heaviest the emperor has
needed since Sept. 19. Domestic news media have said he is
suffering from cancer of the pancreas, but palace officials have
refused to comment on those reports.
   Hirohito, the world's longest-reigning monarch who took power in
1926, has eaten almost no food since he fell ill. He is being fed
intravenously.

   Bombs exploded early Sunday outside a
church and a school in attacks police blamed on German-speaking
separatists in Italy's ethnically troubled Alto Adige region. No
injuries were reported.
   Police said the explosion at San Giuseppe Church in Appiano, six
miles outside Bolzano, severely damaged the main altar, windows and
furnishings.
   The blast caused an estimated $740,000 in damage to the church,
which dates back to 1800 and mainly serves the tiny
Italian-speaking minority in the town of 10,000 people near the
Austrian border.
   Police said the bomb was put on a window sill at the back of the
church.
   It was the first time a church has been targeted in the
separatist bombing campaign in the region, also known as South
Tyrol.
   Police said they found a leaflet at the site signed by the Ein
Tirol separatist group. The leaflet, written in German, called on
local residents to demand a plebiscite for an independent Tyrol and
criticized the bishop of the Bolzano diocese for favoring a mixed
ethnic population.
   In the other attack, which occurred about the same time, a bomb
went off outside a school for Italian speakers in Bolzano.
   Police said the device, hidden in a plastic container, severely
damaged about a dozen cars and smashed windows of the school and
surrounding buildings.
   Although no leaflet was found outside the school, police blamed
the attack on the separatist movement.
   Sunday's attacks brought to 23 the number of bombings in the
Alto Adige region this year. The attacks have caused considerable
property damage but no serious casualties.
   The violence stems from tensions between the Alto Adige's
300,000 ethnic Germans and 125,000 Italians. The region was taken
from Austria at the end of World War I.
   The German-speaking majority wants priority in obtaining
government jobs and more control over local broadcasting. Another
goal is the right to have trials conducted in German. Extremists
want an independent Tyrolian state.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Bush, Dukakis Differ on Reasons For Soviet Shifts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Another in a series on the presidential hopefuls and the
issues.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush is running for
president on his extensive foreign policy credentials and on the
strength of the Reagan administration's triumph in signing a
nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union.
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, who cannot match his rival's
experience, instead attacks Bush's judgment and challenges the
administration's right to claim any credit for the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan or the end of the Iran-Iraq war.
   Dukakis supports the negotiated ban on medium-range nuclear
missiles and endorses the goal of a 50 percent reduction in
long-range missiles in U.S.-Soviet talks at Geneva. But he
attributes the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's recognition of his country's economic
failures, not to President Reagan's military buildup and get-tough
stance toward the Soviets.
   Both presidential candidates would be certain to press ahead
with arms control talks and try to build on the momentum achieved
in the four Reagan-Gorbachev summits.
   Although Dukakis has accused the Reagan administration of
mishandling Middle East policy and waiting until the twilight of
its term to seek a breakthrough there, neither Dukakis nor Bush has
spelled out any major initiatives to bring the Arabs and Israelis
together.
   Both have assured Israel of continued U.S. support. Dukakis has
endorsed shifting the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a
move that administration officials fear could undermine progress
toward an Arab-Israeli settlement.
   But in such troublespots as Nicaragua and South Africa, Dukakis
is committed to changing the policies adopted by Reagan and
championed by Bush.
   Bush supports renewed aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
Dukakis calls Reagan's Central-American policies ``a fiasco'' and
vehemently opposes Contra aid, favoring instead the diplomatic
peace plan of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   On South Africa, Dukakis promises to press for tougher
international sanctions against the apartheid regime. Bush says
further sanctions would only hurt black workers. Dukakis also
opposes U.S. aid for the South African-backed rebels in Angola.
   The Democratic nominee says the United States should work with
its allies and through international organizations rather than go
it alone. He has said the NATO allies and Japan must bear a larger
share of the common defense.
   Bush, a former ambassador to the United Nations, says, ``You've
got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand
for freedom and democracy around the world, and we can't turn it
over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.''
   Bush cites the INF treaty, the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan and the tentative end of the Iran-Iraq war as
vindication of the administration's ``peace through strength''
philosophy.
   For the vice president, that means pressing ahead with
development and eventual deployment of Star Wars, or the Strategic
Defense Initiative, which Dukakis once ridiculed as a fantasy.
   It also means pounding Dukakis for opposing both the mobile MX
and Midgetman missiles. ``The Soviets are modernizing. They
continue to modernize. And we can't simply say, `We've got enough
nuclear weapons. Let's freeze','' Bush said.
   Dukakis favored a nuclear freeze in the early 1980s when the
Reagan administration persuaded nervous allies in Western Europe to
accept Pershing II and cruise missiles to counter the Soviet's own
medium-range weapons.
   The governor has said the 13,000 nuclear weapons in the U.S.
arsenal and the 9,000 stockpiled by the Soviets are enough to blow
each country up ``forty times over.''
   But Dukakis supports the Stealth bomber, which rolls off the
assembly line in a few weeks, and backs the new generation of
nuclear missiles for the Trident submarine.
   Bush has said his approach toward the Soviet Union ``would avoid
swings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated pessimism.''
Dukakis speaks of trying to ``drive the agenda with the Soviet
Union'' instead of following Gorbachev's lead.
   Bush has visited 74 foreign countries as vice president. He was
envoy to China and director of central intelligence as well as
ambassador to the United Nations.
   ``I don't think we should risk turning over the leadership and
security of this free world of ours to a man with literally no
experience in foreign affairs,'' Bush told voters in South River,
N.J., recently.
   ``It's not the length of your resume,'' counters Dukakis. ``It's
your strength, it's your values, the quality of the people you
pick. It's your understanding of the forces of change in a sweeping
new world.''
   Dukakis has questioned Bush's judgment in not trying to block
the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran. He says Bush must share the
blame for dealing with Panamana's military leader, Manuel Noriega,
now under indictment for alleged involvement in drug trafficking.
He criticized Bush for once toasting ousted Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos for ``your adherence to democratic principles.''
   Dukakis supports a mutual ban on testing and deployment of
anti-satellite weapons and a prohibition of all underground nuclear
tests.
   Bush supports the administration's controversial, broad
interpretation of the anti-ballistic missile or ABM treaty, a move
intended to leave room for testing Star Wars. Dukakis favors the
original, narrow interpretation.
   Bush says he wants the world to adopt and enforce a total ban on
chemical and biological weapons. Dukakis scoffs at that, saying
that Bush cast tie-breaking Senate votes in favor of resuming
production of chemical weapons.
   Bush has accused Dukakis of opposing the U.S. invasion of
Grenada in 1983 and the 1986 strike against Libya. The Democrat
denies the charge.
   Dukakis hedged his support on both occasions. He said the
Grenada invasion was justified if the lives of American students
were at stake, and the Libyan raid was proper if its aim was to hit
terrorist bases and not to assassinate Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi.

<TEXT>
   Chestoa View, a scenic overlook
jutting out from the Blue Ridge Parkway in the mountains of North
Carolina, has become the focal point of a murder case full of
contradictions and intrigue.
   Did Jim Gibbs, a hardworking father of three, push his wife,
Helen, and another woman hundreds of feet to their death Oct. 17?
   Or is Gibbs a victim in his time of grief, an innocent man
charged with murder for an accident?
   ``I can't see a shred of evidence against him,'' said Gibbs'
younger brother, Gerald Gibbs. ``He adored that woman. With God as
my witness, I never heard a cross word between them.''
   But authorities said Gibbs' account of what happened is full of
holes. That includes his explanation that the three adults left
five children alone at their motel and went to Chestoa View to take
photos of the sunset.
   ``If he wanted a sunset picture he wouldn't be taking them
facing east,'' said Howard Parr, chief ranger for the parkway for
the National Parks Service. ``We also were suspicious how this guy
was at a loss to explain what happened just before they fell.''
   Sheriff Bobby Haynes said Gibbs, 37, of Fayetteville, was
arrested after ``things didn't add up.'' The couple had been having
marital problems and a $100,000 life insurance policy had been
taken out on Mrs. Gibbs last spring, he said.
   Gibbs' lawyer, Ronnie Mitchell, acknowledged problems in the
10-year marriage but said that the couple had reconciled and that
the insurance was Mrs. Gibbs' idea. ``I don't know who the
beneficiary is,'' he said.
   Initial reports indicated Mrs. Gibbs, 31, and her friend, Susan
Haire, 32, of Ladson, S.C., died in an accident. Their bodies were
found 150 feet and 300 feet below the overlook.
   Gibbs, who also was found about 150 feet down, told
investigators he had his back turned and was setting up his camera
when one of the women apparently slipped over the two-foot wall and
pulled the other one with her.
   Gibbs said he fell while trying to rescue the women and was
hospitalized overnight, but Parr said he suffered only minor cuts
and bruises.
   ``If he had fallen 100 feet like he claimed, he would have been
hurt a lot worse than he was,'' the ranger said.
   Two tourists who were at the overlook that evening told a ranger
they heard voices from the darkened gorge below. They said they
heard a woman scream, ``Oh, my arm!'' and then heard a man's voice,
said Ranger J. Russ Whitlock.
   After five days, police charged Gibbs with murder. The state
will seek the death penalty, said Assistant District Attorney Mike
Edwards.
   Gibbs, who is being held without bail, maintained his innocence
when he was taken to jail.
   ``I swear to God I didn't do it,'' he said. ``I don't know what
happened. You're all wrong. You're crazy. I didn't do it. I tried
to help my wife.''
   During a bail hearing Wednesday, about 30 relatives packed the
courtroom in an unsuccessful effort to win his release. Mrs. Gibbs'
mother, a sister and a brother also were present. They declined to
be interviewed.
   Several of Gibbs' co-workers and friends said he was a dedicated
and loving husband and father who never missed a day of work in
nearly 19 years at a tire plant. Mrs. Gibbs was a nurse at a
Veterans Administration hospital.
   ``Our families spent a lot of time together,'' said Debbie
Baylor, who like Mrs. Haire attended nursing school with Mrs.
Gibbs. ``They were a warm, loving family.''

<HEAD>Nearly Half of Congress Signs East Timor Letters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half the members of Congress asked
Secretary of State George Shultz on Sunday to use his influence in
solving the 13-year armed conflict in the Indonesian territory of
East Timor.
   Forty-seven senators and 182 House members from both parties
signed letters drawn up by Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., and
Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio.
   The letters cite continuing human rights abuses in East Timor,
including the torture of Timorese under interrogation by the
Indonesian military and the transfer of political prisoners to the
capital of Jakarta. They also note that international human rights
organizations have been denied access to the region and the Roman
Catholic Church has been intimidated.
   ``By sending this letter now, my colleagues and I want to ensure
that the East Timor tragedy receives increased attention, both from
the Reagan administration and its successor,'' Durenberger said in
a statement.
   The Senate letter, signed by 33 Democrats and 14 Republicans,
praises Shultz for raising the issue of East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony, with Indonesian officials over the past six
years.
   But it adds, ``We believe the continuing military conflict in
the territory and any renewed shortages of food and medical
supplies warrant the careful attention of the United States.''
   The House letter notes Indonesia's role in seeking an end to the
Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia and says, ``We believe it is
appropriate for a similar effort to be made regarding East Timor.''
Indonesia invaded and annexed East Timor in 1975.
   Hall said about one-fifth of East Timor's original population of
700,000 have died as a result of the invasion and later military
operations in the territory.

<HEAD>Democrats Already Second-Guessing Dukakis As Doomed Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even as Michael Dukakis insists there is time
to score an upset in the Nov. 8 balloting, many Democrats already
are second-guessing his campaign strategy in anticipation of
another national election defeat.
   ``After the election this may be the campaign considered the
worst managed in this century,'' said Democratic Sen. Terry Sanford
of North Carolina.
   Like many people in his party, Sanford insisted he thought
Dukakis still had a chance to defeat Republican nominee George
Bush, but he didn't sound overly optimistic.
   ``I'd bet money on it,'' he said of the chances of a Dukakis
upset. ``But I wouldn't bet my law license on it.''
   Other prominent Democrats have urged Dukakis openly for weeks to
sharpen his responses to Bush's steady attacks.
   ``Dukakis has really got to take off the gloves,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn of Georgia. ``He's got to defend himself. ... I wouldn't have
been a punching bag on some of these issues.''
   Democrats have lost four of the last five presidential
elections, and current polls point to the likelihood that Dukakis
will make it five of six.
   Even Dukakis recently conceded he didn't get his message out
clearly enough and was too slow in responding to negative
commercials from the Bush campaign.
   ``There's no mystery about why they put those ads on. They have
done damage. There's no question about that,'' he said during an
interview on ``CBS Evening News.''
   He said he responded ``but perhaps more subtly than I should
have or than (running mate) Lloyd Bentsen suggested. Why? Because
I'm fundamentally a positive person.''
   On the stump as he headed into the final week of the campaign,
Dukakis proclaimed, ``There is time to do it.''
   ``They're running a beautiful campaign right now,'' said Ed
Martin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. ``But a
proper campaign for three months has been compressed into three
weeks.''
   Among those in the ranks of the second-guessers was New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo, who told reporters he thought the Dukakis
campaign had failed to figure out a general election strategy.
   ``They did so well by the end of the Democratic convention, they
said, okay, now we'll take it easy, get some rest, take our
breath,'' Cuomo said. ``The other guy started landing jabs and
uppercuts and picking up points and then they look at the card with
three rounds to go and now you're down six rounds to three.''
   ``Every campaign has a jillion things go wrong with it,'' said
John White, a Texan and former Democratic Party chairman who backed
Jesse Jackson for the presidential nomination. ``And if you're
behind, everybody points them out.''
   To many Democrats, the biggest problem with the Dukakis campaign
has been a lack of experience in national politics among his top
advisers.
   The men running the Bush effort have experience dating back to
the Gerald Ford campaign in 1976 and, in the case of media adviser
Roger Ailes, to Richard Nixon's campaigns before that. They all
played major roles in Ronald Reagan's 1980 and 1984 campaigns.
   By contrast, no one in the Dukakis campaign had a
decision-making role in any presidential campaign prior to Walter
F. Mondale's 49-state landslide loss to Reagan in 1984.
   ``Our timing has just been terribly off,'' said White. ``In
August nothing happened, so we started August work in September,
September work in October.''
   He attributed that to inexperience.
   ``We do not have any historical memory,'' he said. ``Every
campaign is a brand new one, we bring in brand new people.''
   ``They tried real hard to re-invent the wheel, and when they
ended up it wasn't even round,'' said Boston advertising executive
Dan Payne of the Dukakis campaign staff. Payne produced some of
Dukakis' commercials during the Democratic primaries.
   ``I don't want to do a post-mortem until there's a mortem,''
said Mark Siegel, a political consultant and member of the
Democratic National Committee. ``I don't think this patient is
dead. I think a little sick.''
   Added Siegel: ``I don't want to be critical of the campaign
(but) there were a lots of things some of us would like to have
seen done differently. We would have liked the campaign to take the
initiative from the outset, to define instead of defend, to put
Bush on the defensive.''

   A well-known television actor
and a program manager for the state-controlled radio have been
arrested and charged in connection with a child-sex ring, police
said Sunday.
   The men were arrested in Johannesburg on Saturday and were
released on bail pending a court appearance Monday.
   The arrested men were Don Lamprecht, a leading
Afrikaans-speaking actor who is a star of a television series, and
Tinus Esterhuizen, program manager for the South African Broadcast
Corp.'s overnight radio show. They were charged with sodomy,
indecent assault and possession of pornographic material.
   The Sunday Times, a national newspaper, said Lamprecht provided
the voice for an animated squirrel who, in government-funded
television ads, had been urging South Africans to vote in last
week's municipal elections.
   The newspaper said the arrests of up to a dozen other prominent
figures in the entertainment world were expected.

   A fire on a shooting range at a U.S. Marine base on
Okinawa burned 30 acres of woodland before it was brought under
control Sunday night, a Japanese fire office said.
   U.S. military officials were not immediately available for
comment.
   But the Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said there were no reports of injuries from the fire at Camp Hansen.
   He said the fire began Saturday night on the south ridge of the
mountain in Camp Hansen, which is used for rifle and howitzer
practice.
   The fire spread to adjacent ridges, but U.S. military
helicopters dropped chemicals on the blaze and it had almost burned
out by Sunday night, he said.
   The Kyodo News Service said a lack of rain had left the area
very dry and the fire may have spread after it set off unexploded
shells left on the range.

   No one admits to liking it or even being
influenced by it, but it works. That's why candidates from the
presidency down are running negative campaigns.
   ``It's sort of like television. Everyone deplores it yet people
watch it,'' says Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup polling
organization. ``They don't like negative campaigning. But they have
to take their cues about these candidates from what's being
offered.''
   Negative campaigns are nothing new. ``I'm sure that in elections
for the Roman Senate, people criticized their opponents,'' says
Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman.
   What is relatively new is the television ``attack ad,'' a media
tool that reinforces and magnifies a candidate's campaign rhetoric.
These ads sometimes allow him to be a soft-spoken candidate while
impersonal narrators trash his rival in 30-second spots on the TV
screen.
   ``Delivering the message through television is much more
effective than going out on the stump and calling the other guy a
scoundrel,'' Kohut says.
   The memorable scenes produced by Republican George Bush's TV
campaign include prisoners passing through a revolving door and a
harbor filled with floating trash _ attack ads against Democrat
Michael Dukakis about prison furloughs and Boston Harbor pollution.
   ``The endless images of prisoners coming through turnstiles into
your living room are much more powerful than anything Bush can say
on the stump in a 15-second news clip,'' says Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, a University of Texas professor and specialist in
political communications.
   Dukakis began fighting back only after weeks of leaving Bush's
TV assaults unanswered. Political scientist Larry Sabato says
Dukakis made a misjudgment that could prove fatal in an era when
``an attack unanswered is an attack agreed to.''
   Besides his tough, negative TV ads, the vice president has
attacked the Massachusetts governor personally for his membership
in the American Civil Liberties Union and his veto of a bill that
would have required teachers to lead their classes in reciting the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   Bush doesn't sound damagingly strident because ``it all looks
positive,'' Jamieson said. ``He frames it as a defense of the
country against a dangerous enemy.''
   The upshot is that in the battle between Dukakis and Bush to
define the Democratic presidential nominee, the GOP candidate seems
to be winning.
   Said Hickman: ``Last spring Dukakis was an empty vessel and the
Dukakis campaign, through free press and paid advertising, was
trying to pour crystal clear water into that vessel. At the same
time, the Bush campaign was trying to pour ink into it. It
obviously changed the color of the water.''
   Moreover, he said, ``negative campaigning probably helped Bush
overcome his wimp image, and not responding probably made people
think Dukakis is passive.''
   Negative campaigning, however, can backfire.
   Jamieson cites the classic case of a 1966 ad against Ronald
Reagan in his first bid for governor of California. The ad said
Reagan was a movie actor who had played many roles. ``This year he
wants to play governor. Are you willing to pay the price of
admission?'' it asked.
   ``What a stupid ad in a community that earns its living by
entertaining,'' Jamieson said. ``The Republicans thought it was so
effective they paid for time and aired it themselves.''
   Negative campaigning is rampant on the Senate trail as well this
year. The New York Times said in an editorial that the race in New
Jersey ``has frequently looked more like mud-wrestling than a
contest for the U.S. Senate.''
   In Minnesota, Sen. David Durenberger and Democratic challenger
Hubert H. Humphrey III are trying to negotiate a cease-fire after
exchanging a barrage of TV attacks. Nebraska Senate candidate
Robert Kerrey is scoring with an ad featuring an animated clay
figure that attacks GOP Sen. David Karnes' assault tactics.
   Unlike academics and politicians who bemoan the sorry state of
campaigning, Hickman says negativity is inevitable and not
necessarily bad.
   ``Why shouldn't voters find useful information in this?'' he
asks. ``Part of what you want to find out is, how does a candidate
comport himself when he's under fire. ... An election is an
adversarial proceeding. Voters understand that.''
   But Sabato, a University of Virginia professor, says voters can
reach their limits with negative campaigning, and register their
protests in the polls.
   ``Once they do that, you'll be surprised how quickly the
consultants turn to positive ads,'' Sabato said, citing two Senate
races in North Carolina to prove his point.
   The 1984 contest between Jesse Helms and James Hunt was bitter
and expensive. Two years later, the race between Terry Sanford and
James Broyhill had a ``civilized, upbeat tone,'' Sabato said.
   ``Their polling kept showing that people were reacting strongly
to the negatives that were run,'' Sabato said. ``They were hearing,
`If I see one more negative ad, I'm voting against the candidate
who airs it'.''

   An explosion early Sunday leveled a
downtown building and severely damaged two adjacent apartment
buildings, injuring 11 people, authorities said.
   The explosion, about two blocks from the state Capitol, also
broke windows in a number of downtown stores and was felt by
residents several miles away. Police patrolled downtown streets to
prevent looting.
   ``I heard a very big explosion and all the lights went out,''
said Joyce Kelley, who lived in one of the apartments and got out
safely with her 10-month-old daughter. ``I started yelling `Fire!'
because I knew there were other people in the building.''
   Authorities suspected natural gas triggered the blast that blew
out plate glass windows three blocks away and flattened the
two-story building, which housed the Missouri Association for
Social Welfare, a private advocacy group, said Sgt. Ralph Robinett
of the Missouri State Highway Patrol.
   Fires that broke out in small apartment houses on either side of
the building were brought under control about two hours later.
   Police said 13 people occupied units in the apartment buildings.
Eleven were treated at hospitals for cuts and other minor injuries,
police said.
   Seventeen of 18 huge plate-glass windows in a Food Barn
supermarket about three blocks away blew out.
   ``We just feel fortunate it wasn't in the middle of a busy day
when there were lots of customers around,'' said store manager
Russell Warson.

<TEXT>
   Scientists will not rush another attempt to launch
the Soviet space shuttle, which was grounded 51 seconds before
blastoff because of problems with ground equipment, a newspaper
report said Sunday.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, quoting Air Force Maj. Gen. Vladimir E.
Gudilin, said the next effort to put the craft into orbit would
likely take place after the Revolution Day holiday Nov. 7.
   However, Gudilin was quoted as saying, ``We're ready to try
again quite soon.''
   ``You must not forget that our launch is experimental, that
there hasn't been any other like it,'' he said. ``Does a child
learning to walk not fall?
   ``In the situation that arose _ which of course was emotionally
unpleasant __ there is a rational grain: accumulating experience.''
   The launch of the unmanned shuttle, named Buran, was postponed
Saturday after a computer sensed that an equipment platform had not
pulled far enough away from the giant Energiya booster rocket. The
computer automatically stopped the countdown.
   The Soviet official said all systems would be checked while
technicians refill rockets with liquid fuel, the newspaper reported.
   Unlike the first flight of the U.S. shuttle Columbia in 1981,
the Soviet craft will be unmanned, flying on an automated guidance
system. Plans for its first flight call for it to make two orbits
around Earth and return to a concrete landing strip eight miles
from the launch site.
   The huge booster rocket, which can lift a payload of more than
100 tons, has been used only once before.
   On a test flight in May 1987, its payload failed to reach orbit.
Soviet officials said the problem stemmed from the guidance system
rather than the booster rocket.

   Basque separatists released a businessman
early Sunday after holding him hostage for more than eight months,
police said.
   The separatists drove Emiliano Revilla, 60, a real estate
investor in Madrid, 200 yards from his home and freed him about 2
a.m., police said.
   Revilla's daughter Margarita told reporters her father ``was
exhausted but in good health.'' She refused to comment on Spanish
news reports that the family paid a multimillion dollar ransom to
win Revilla's freedom.
   Two men and a woman armed with guns kidnapped him near his home
on Feb. 24. The separatist group ETA claimed responsibility.
   After the kidnapping the government suspended talks with exiled
ETA leaders in Algeria. The talks were aimed at ending the group's
violent campaign for independence.
   ``There can be no contacts as long as violence continues,'' the
government said when it called off the talks.
   ETA, an acronym for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque language,
has been fighting since 1968 for independence for three northern
Basque provinces.
   The group has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600
people, mostly soldiers and police officers.
   ETA also has extorted what it calls ``revolutionary taxes'' from
Basque businessmen and kidnapped them to win ransom money.

   A strong earthquake awakened residents
early Sunday but no damage or injuries were reported, the Alaska
Tsunami Warning Center reported.
   The temblor measured 5.1 on the Richter scale of ground motion.
It struck at 1:33 a.m. about 60 miles northwest of Homer, said Paul
Whitmore, a geophysicist at the center.
   ``A lot of people felt it in Anchorage and Palmer,'' Whitmore
said. ``That area that it occurred in is a farily common area for
earthquakes.''
   But since the quake was so early in the morning, the center
received few calls about it, Whitmore said.
   ``I woke up sometime in the night because I felt my house
shaking,'' said Stan Porter, a Federal Aviaion Administration
official at the Homer flight service station. ``But that's just
part of life up here,'' he said, adding that he rolled over and
went back to sleep.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage in a populated area, 6 can be severe and a 7 reading is a
``major'' quake, capable of widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Tutu Visits Blacks Threatened With Eviction</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PORT NOLLOTH, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu on
Sunday prayed with and encouraged blacks threatened with eviction
from this fishing town, hundreds of miles from the nearest area
where they can live legally.
   The church service concluded a two-day visit by the Anglican
leader to a windswept, treeless plain outside Port Nolloth, about
400 miles north of Cape Town. About 500 blacks live in 90 tents in
the remote town.
   ``God is on your side, and God cannot ultimately be defeated,''
Tutu told the congregation. ``That is why those who oppress you
have already lost.''
   The tent dwellers, who were served with eviction notices in
January, are fighting the order in court.
   Under South Africa's segregation laws, blacks have no legal
right to live in this sparsely populated region called Namaqualand,
which stretches along the Atlantic Coast to the border with
South-West Africa.
   The nearest official black township is in Upington, more than
300 miles east.
   Tutu arrived Saturday on his first visit to the desolate camp
whose residents collect water in barrels and use portable outhouses.
   About 100 women, some with babies on their backs, led the black
archbishop and his wife, Leah, through the rows of tents.
   While Tutu conferred with community leader Lingington Sonqishe
in a corrugated metal shack, a crowd outside sang in praise of Tutu
and Oliver Tambo, president of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla group fighting apartheid.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice
in national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his campaign
against the policy of segregation, said he was dismayed at the
living conditions but impressed with the determination of the
residents.
   ``I want to express admiration for the people here, at the
extraordinary resilience and the strength of their commitment to
stand for their rights,'' Tutu said. ``One is humbled, really, to
see how people refuse to be manipulated and intimidated.''
   Many of the Port Nolloth blacks, who work in mines or with the
fishing industry, have been in the area for 10 years. Initially,
they lived with mixed-race people in a shantytown that was
demolished.
   The mixed-race population was given new housing, while most of
the blacks fled to South-West Africa, which is ruled by South
Africa. Authorities there forced them back into South Africa in
1986, and the blacks believed the government was going to allow
them to stay permanently.
   A legal battle has been waged since then, with the next court
session scheduled Nov. 9.
   ``They were given the promise that they would have houses built
for them,'' Tutu said. ``The town council is reneging on that
promise. Their only sin is that they have black skin.''
   If the tents are demolished, Sonqishe said, the residents would
live outdoors ``like monkeys and baboons. Then the whole world will
see the suffering.''
   Tutu's visit to Port Nolloth was covered by crews from
Independent Television Network and Visnews, two London-based
television news agencies. ITN's bureau chief, Mike Wills, said
security police seized the film when it arrived at a small airport
near Johannesburg Sunday afternoon. The officers said they were
acting under state-of-emergency regulations, Wills said.

   Heavy rains and flooding in central
Vietnam this month killed 100 people and left half a million
homeless, the official radio reported Sunday.
   The Voice of Vietnam, monitored in Bangkok, said the storm also
destroyed 1.25 million acres of rice fields and heavily damaged
620,000 acres of other crops. It said 28 people were missing.
   Efforts to help flood victims were under way, said the
broadcast, which gave no other details.
   Each year, tropical storms cause considerable damage to
agriculture and loss of life in Vietnam, one of the world's poorest
nations.
   Earlier Vietnamese radio reports said prolonged rains and
flooding occurred in a 625-mile stretch from Thanh Hoa to Phu Khanh
provinces, pulling down thousands buildings.
   Water levels of four rivers reached record levels before the
rains stopped Oct. 18 and the floodwaters began receding, the
reports said.

vote.
   Islamic radicals took over the embassy Nov. 4, 1979, nine months
after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi. Fifty-two Americans were held hostage 444 days.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Nov. 4 is an important day in
the history of the Islamic revolution in Iran. On that date in
1963, Khomeini was exiled by the shah. He continued his opposition
from abroad until his triumphant return Feb. 1, 1979.
   On the same date in 1978, an opposition demonstration by
students and others at Tehran was put down violently by the shah's
armed forces.
   The embassy takeover was described by the agency as ``the
takeover of the espionage den by the Moslem Students Following the
Imam's Line.''

   Two jilted men died in separate weekend accidents
in which they fell from apartment buildings while trying to climb
in to see their girlfriends, police said Sunday.
   Dale Moll, 33, a North Side businessman, fell 16 stories
Saturday morning while attempting to use television cables on the
roof of a high-rise to rappel down to the window of his
girlfriend's 15th floor apartment, said Detective Tom Johnson.
   Less than a half-hour later, Robert Harris, 25, fell from an
eighth-story ledge while trying to get into his apartment after his
girlfriend locked him out following an argument, said Patrolman
Joseph Mescall.
   ``I don't think any girl is worth it to climb that high,''
Mescall said.
   Moll, who owned an artificial sun-tanning business, was
pronounced dead on arrival at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
   Harris suffered massive internal injuries and died early Sunday
after undergoing surgery at Cook County Hospital, said Aaron
Cunningham, a hospital administrator.
   Police said Moll went to his girlfriend's apartment building
after she did not answer his telephone calls Friday evening and
Saturday morning.
   ``Their relationship had been in an estranged state for some
time and she hadn't been seeing him,'' Johnson said.
   Moll went to the roof of the high-rise and tried to climb down
television cables to gain access to his girlfriend's apartment. She
wasn't home at the time, Johnson said.
   Police said Moll stopped at a 16th floor apartment and swung
away when a woman inside screamed, and then the cable snapped.
   ``The woman became alarmed and started screaming,'' Johnson
said. ``He (Moll) said, `I'm sorry I have the wrong apartment,' or
something like that. Then she looked out the window and observed
him lying on the ground.
   ``It appears that he was trying to climb down hand over hand and
rappel, but the cable snapped because it was not made to support
that weight.'' Johnson estimated the victim weighed at least 170
pounds.
   In the second accident, Harris' girlfriend kicked him out of his
apartment at a West Side housing complex run by the Chicago Housing
Authority, Mescall said.
   Harris then went next door to a vacant apartment and climbed out
on the window ledge, then fell while trying to get into his
apartment, Mescall said.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim 20 Dissidents Executed In Iran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iranian rebels said Sunday that
authorities in Iran have executed 20 dissidents in recent days by
firing squad or hanging.
   The Iraqi-based Radio Mujahed, run by the opposition group
Mujahedeen Khalq, said three dissidents were hanged in the city of
Zanjan, 160 miles west of Tehran.
   Three Mujahedeen members were hanged in the provincial capital
of Hamadan in western Iran, the report said.
   Thirteen others were shot by firing squad in Mashhad in
northwest Iran and one was shot in the western city of Arak, the
radio report said.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report. But Iran's
official media, monitored in Nicosia, has reported that scores of
``counterrevolutionaries and Iraqi spies'' have been publicly
executed in the last three months.
   The Iraqi-based Mujahedeen, who seek to topple Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's fundamentalist government, claim that nearly
2,000 dissidents have been executed and thousands arrested since
August.
   The radio said the executions and arrests were being carried out
because the Tehran authorities ``fear being overthrown by the
Iranian opposition.''
   Over the last 18 months, Iranian authorities have publicly
acknowledged that the opposition force was becoming a problem. Some
Iranian leaders publicly have called for the execution of all
Mujahedeen prisoners without trial.

   The plight of whales trapped by Arctic
Ocean ice got worldwide attention, and the part played in their
rescue by two Soviet icebreakers got the special attention of
members of a third grade class.
   ``I feel sorry for every living creature that has to go through
this,'' said Lisa DeLack, a third-grader at Centennial Elementary
School in Loveland.
   Lisa convinced her teacher and school principal that the Soviets
deserved some thanks for their help in freeing two California gray
whales off the north coast of Alaska. A third whale disappeared and
was presumed dead.
   ``I saw the whales and the Russians helping and I thought it was
very nice of them to do it,'' Lisa said.
   So she and her classmates penned their appreciation on
blue-lined school paper, some illustrated with drawings of whales.
Their letters were sealed in an envelope and mailed to Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow.
   Centennial principal Sam Simonetta says it's natural for the
children to respond to animals, be they pets or wild creatures
thousands of miles away.
   `They like them and they're concerned about them,'' Simonetta
said.
   ``When someone came in and was willing to help our country, it
made these kids feel real good about it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Defense Contractors Support Nunn Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Defense contractors are eagerly
studying Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn's suggestion for a ground-based
system to protect against an accidental missile attack.
   At least two major California contractors ran to their drawing
boards after Nunn, the Georgia chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, broached the idea last January as a limited
alternative to Star Wars, the Reagan administration's proposal for
a space-based anti-missile system.
   Nunn's proposal, the Accidental Launch Protection Systems, would
resemble the Anti-Ballistic Missile defense system dismantled in
the mid-1970s. Although the proposal has some support, the
Pentagon's Defense Science Board placed little emphasis on it in a
report last May and Nunn himself appears to have concluded that
deploying a limited system would cause more problems than it would
solve.
   Nunn has acknowledged that for the system to be effective it
would be costly and may not be possible within the Anti-ballistic
Missile Treaty.
   Nunn's plan offended those opposed to Star Wars, or the
Strategic Defense Initiative. They argued any deployment of an
anti-missile system would abrogate the 1972 treaty.
   But many defense contractors and other SDI backers support
Nunn's plan because they think it may open the way to a more
extensive anti-missile system, including space-based weapons.
Congress has frozen Star Wars funding at about $4.1 billion.
   Edward Teller, the physicist credited with planting the idea for
Star Wars with President Reagan in 1983, calls ALPS ``a valuable
first step to show that we can put up something, to show what a
system will cost.''
   Some major defense contractors agree. They say a system to
protect the continental United States from a limited ballistic
missile attack could be deployed for about $10 billion. The
Pentagon spends about $300 billion a year.
   Bob Willwerth, an engineer at Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. in
Sunnyvale, said the entire continental United States could be
protected from a limited attack if 100 anti-missile missiles were
based at Grand Forks, N.D.
   The United States dismantled a similar system in Grand Forks in
the mid-1970's because it was deemed ineffective. The Soviets have
a 100-missile anti-ballistic missile system around Moscow,
permitted under the ABM pact.
   Engineers at Lockheed and at the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics
Co. in Huntington Beach say existing surveillance, tracking and
command systems are nearly adequate to operate a 100-missile
anti-missile system.
   ``Roughly two-thirds of what you need is already in place,''
said Willwerth, pointing at a chart that shows satellites and
communications links already used to warn of a Soviet attack.
   Lockheed has a contract to develop the Exoatmospheric
Reentry-Vehicle Interceptor System (ERIS) that would strike enemy
warheads before they reenter the atmosphere to begin their final
descent.
   The system has been designated by the Pentagon as the one most
likely to be used in the first phase of Star Wars should the United
States decide in the 1990s to go ahead with the space-based
anti-missile system.
   McDonnell Douglas has developed another system to intercept
warheads after they entered the atmosphere.
   Although the system has not been accepted as part of the first
phase of the Star Wars project, McDonnell Douglas engineers are
pushing it as a possible key component for ALPS. McDonnell
Douglas's system is known as High Endoatmospheric Defense
Interceptor (HEDI).
   Dean Hofferth of McDonnell Douglas estimates it would cost about
$10 billion to build an ALPS system of 70 ERIS and 30 HEDI missiles
at Grand Forks.
   But Hofferth said a single-site system such as one at Grand
Forks could not protect the continental United States from an
accidental attack, especially by submarines.
   Instead, McDonnell proposes five or six additional sites spaced
along the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts with 60-70 ERIS and
60-70 HEDI missiles apiece, costing an estimated $3 billion per
site.
   That would violate the AMB treaty, which limits each superpower
to a single site with 100 anti-missile missiles.
   A single site, said Hofferth, would be overwhelmed by an
unauthorized launch by a single enemy commander.
   Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles are deployed in
batteries of about 10 missiles, which in the case of the heavy
SS-18 missile, could carry 100 or more warheads.

   The Soviet government's ability to slide budget
deficits past the legislature for years could have been a result of
simple ignorance.
   The huge bureaucracy that sets prices irrespective of supply and
demand, and the virtual absence of any accounting system in
state-run businesses, may have hid the size of the problem until
Mikhail S. Gorbachev began implementing his economic reforms.
   Government officials acknowledged during a two-day session of
the Supreme Soviet on Thursday and Friday that the budget has been
running in the red for years. The $795 billion budget for 1989
passed Friday by the legislature contains a deficit $55 billion at
the official exchange rate.
   But that may be just a guess.
   The Soviet Union has only recently discovered the concept of
accounting for profit and loss. Finance Minister Boris Gostev said
Thursday that ``so far, accounting is not yet reliable'' because
many administrators don't understand modern management.
   Until recently, prices in the Soviet Union were set by the
government, without regard to costs. The massive attempt to
determine the real cost of everything in the country started in
January. Actual price reform is still in the planning stages.
   Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, Gorbachev's closest
adviser on the Politburo, said last week that the economy turned
out to be in worse shape than the leadership thought when it began
the policy of perestroika, or reconstruction, three years ago.
   For decades, the Soviet Union has tried to ignore the law of
supply and demand. The government set prices that were designed to
nearly give away the basics of life _ a roof, heat, a bus ride to
work, bread and cabbage _ and to charge a fortune for most
everything else.
   An apartment could cost 25 rubles, or $40, a month. At the same
time, a video cassette was priced at 70 rubles, or $110.
   The government was building expensive apartments, virtually
giving them away, and losing money on each one.
   In factories, all prices were fixed by bureaucrats, and
generations of managers didn't dare breathe the word ``profit.''
   The result, according to Gostev's calculations, is 24,000
bankrupt businesses and a budget deficit. Now, he said, ``We have
to learn how to live according to our incomes.''
   Soviets also are discovering that capital has a cost.
``Enterprises functioning at a loss don't feel they are,'' Gostev
said, because they are using funds generated by other businesses.
   Without market interest rates to ensure that capital investment
is used either efficiently or not at all, the Soviets wound up with
hundreds of half-finished construction projects and mounds of
modern equipment lying unused in factory warehouses.
   State planning chief Yuri Maslyukov gave a hint of the problem
when he said Friday that the government is giving up on hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of unfinished farm buildings. Those
projects, he said, will be written off _ another alien concept in
the Soviet Union.
   Publicizing the deficit is a natural outgrowth of Gorbachev's
policy of glasnost, or openness. But it clearly aids his program of
perestroika by telling the public that waste, inefficiency and
subsidies have a cost.
   That lays the groundwork for an expected reduction in those
subsidies and for his newest drive, a demand for stringent
cost-cutting in government agencies and the state-run businesses
that still make up 99 percent of the economy.
   Even if the deficit estimate was accurate, translating it from
rubles to dollars has little meaning. The ruble is not freely
convertible to dollars.
   News stories typically use the official Soviet exchange rate,
set at $1.61 to the ruble by the government. The black market rate
is 20-25 cents to the ruble, which is closer but probably lower
than a free-trade rate would be.
   At that rate, the Soviet deficit would be only $6.8 billion to
$8.5 billion, but the entire Soviet government would be operating
on only about $100 billion to $120 billion a year.

   Canadians caught up in debate over a free trade
pact with the United States are following a heated political race
of their own and paying less attention than usual to the U.S.
presidential campaign.
   What they do see south of the border is often dismissed as an
excessive amount of media handling and too much superficial
treatment of the issues.
   Canadians congratulated themselves after the debate series among
the leaders of their three major parties by comparing the breadth
of the discussions with the debates between the U.S. candidates.
   ``Canada's leaders were much more forthright, articulate and
revealing of themselves than the candidates for the White House in
the U.S. debates,'' the independent Globe and Mail newspaper said
in an editorial. ``Issues received far more vigorous airings here
within the limits of television.''
   Six hours of debates between Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of
the Progressive Conservative Party, Liberal Party leader John
Turner and Ed Broadbent of the socialist New Democratic Party
crystallized the free trade agreement with the United States as the
campaign's dominant issue.
   Before Mulroney dissolved Parliament Oct. 1 to call the
election, some concern was voiced that a November election could be
complicated because voters might be distracted by the U.S. campaign.
   Instead, a once complacent political race, in which Mulroney
appeared headed for easy victory, now is becoming among the most
electric in memory.
   A survey by the Environics polling firm found that 74 percent of
Canadians either watched the debates here or followed news reports
about them. Polls have concluded that Turner easily won the
debates, in which he accused Mulroney of selling out Canada in the
free trade agreement.
   Anything less than a majority government for Mulroney in the
Nov. 21 vote places in doubt the future of the agreement, which
would eliminate tariffs and trade barriers between the two
countries over a 10-year period.
   The U.S. Congress easily approved it this year, but Canada's
Parliament has yet to act on it. If passed in Canada, the agreement
would take effect Jan. 1.
   Some political analysts say the U.S. campaign between George
Bush and Michael Dukakis is simply considered boring. They note
that the contest slipped off the front pages in the United States
in its middle weeks.
   ``There's no clear favorite for Canadians,'' David Eirikson, a
political science professor at the University of British Columbia,
said in a phone interview. ``They (Canadians) are busy with
domestic affairs.''
   A Gallup poll published by the Toronto Star in early October
said 56 percent of Canadians were for Dukakis and 44 percent for
Bush.
   The question asked the 1,039 Canadians surveyed was: ``Just
suppose for a minute that Canadians were allowed to vote in a U.S.
presidential election. If the U.S. election were held today, would
you cast your vote for Republican George Bush or Democrat Michael
Dukakis?''
   The cornerstones of Canadian public opinion about government
generally are based on such issues as health care, social services
and other policies that would be to the left of the Republican
Party.
   Dukakis also is known to provincial leaders from eastern Canada
because of of his participation in regional forums. Quebec's
premier, Robert Bourassa, has spoken well of the Massachusetts
governor.
   Both U.S. candidates have pledged they would make improvements
on acid rain, the other key issue troubling U.S.-Canadian relations.
   Michael Perley of the Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain said in an
interview that either would be an improvement on the Reagan
administration ``by a considerable margin.''
   He said Dukakis' plan ``is the more detailed and the more savvy,
if you like,'' while Bush is ``vaguer.'' But he added, ``We don't
feel it's our place as a Canadian interest group to endorse
anyone.''
   Canadians often express dismay at the low voter turnout in the
United States.
   ``Almost half of eligible American voters are expected to sit
out next month's U.S. elections, putting the multimillion-dollar
show-biz political campaigns in the category of a couch-potato
sport,'' wrote Norma Greenaway, a Canadian Press correspondent in
Washington.
   Canadian voter turnout has averaged 75 percent in the nine
federal elections since 1962.

   A newspaper advertisement invoked the name of
Adolf Hitler to attack the left-of-center Labor Party on Sunday in
escalating political warfare before this week's election.
   Politicians made last-ditch efforts to sway undecided voters
before parliamentary elections Tuesday. The latest polls showed
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres' Labor Party running neck-and-neck.
   The army sent extra troops to the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip to prevent any upsurge in violence caused by the elections.
   Underground leaders of the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising
called for a general strike in the occupied lands on election day
and asked Israeli Arabs to ``elect the voices of peace.''
   Peres has backed the idea of exchanging occupied land for
guarantees of peace. Shamir's Likud bloc rejects the idea.
   The uprising is the central issue in the campaign.
   The Hitler ad, which appeared in the daily Maariv, showed the
words ``International Conference'' below a photo of Hitler meeting
former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain during the 1938
Munich Conference.
   Peres favors an international conference to achieve lasting
peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Likud and other
right-wing parties argue that such a conference would pressure
Israel to accept an unfavorable settlement.
   The ad seemed to suggest that Israel would be selling out to
very dangerous opponents if it made agreements at an international
meeting.
   ``The Labor Party's competitors, first and foremost the Likud,
have lost their sanity by giving a nation of Holocaust survivors
such revolting propaganda,'' the Labor Party said in its statement.
About 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
   Labor leaders asked the Central Elections Commission to ban such
ads.
   Likud spokesman Danny Naveh said his party's members were not
behind the ad, Israel radio reported. He said he knew who paid for
it but refused to give the name.
   Maariv deputy editor Yitzhak Hayerushalmi said the newspaper
will publish an apology for the ad Monday. He said someone in the
advertising department ``messed up'' by failing to consult editors
before publishing the ad.
   In radio commercials Sunday, Likud accused Labor of secretly
planning a 70-percent tax hike after the elections. It also said a
Labor victory would hurt Israel's Jews.
   One ad featured what it called a ``worried voter'' saying: ``If
Shamir is elected, it will be a disaster _ a disaster for the Arabs!
   ``If Peres is elected, it will be a disaster for us.''
   Peres, in his final campaign swing through southern Israel,
lashed out at Likud for trying to frighten the public and told
voters that an international conference would not endanger Israel.
   He criticized Likud's ``personal attacks'' during the campaign
and vowed never to negotiate directly with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   ``The PLO represents violence,'' Peres told reporters in
Bersheba. ``It doesn't matter what the PLO says, it matters what
they shoot.''
   A survey by a Labor-aligned polling service, published Sunday,
predicted the party and its leftist allies would win 63 seats in
the Knesset, or parliament, to Likud's 57. The poll was based on
interviews with 1,200 voters, including Israeli Arabs.
   A survey conducted by a Likud-affiliated service and published
Sunday indicated the elections would end in a stalemate.
   Labor and Likud have shared power in an uneasy alliance since
1984, when neither party could form a majority coalition government
after elections.

   The president of Stanford's Black
Student Union spoke calmly, controlling her anger in the tumult of
a protest against racism on campus.
   There's a dangerous link, she said, between racist terms
scrawled on posters at Stanford, racial slurs at Smith College and
a ``ghetto party'' at DePauw.
   ``These aren't isolated incidents,'' said Mary Dillard. ``And
it's happening at Cornell, Pennsylvania, Harvard, Yale. There's
something wrong with the best and the brightest.''
   Officials of the nation's top universities are trying to figure
out what is wrong and how to fix it, but the results so far have
been disappointing.
   Stanford President Donald Kennedy, mindful of racist incidents
last year, warned freshmen in his orientation address this fall
that ``bigotry is out.'' Yet soon afterward two more racist acts
shocked the campus.
   The first was the scrawling of the word ``niggers'' across a
black fraternity poster. In the second, a poster of German composer
Ludwig van Beethoven was altered so he appeared to be black after a
fraternity house discussion about historic figures alleged to have
some black ancestry.
   It takes A's, high test scores and other accomplishments to get
into Stanford University, but as Dillard noted, ``there is an
appalling ignorance among many students about other cultures and
that leads to trouble.''
   Ewart A.C. Thomas, a psychologist and dean of Stanford's School
of Humanities and Sciences, notes ``there have been more overt acts
of racism in this decade'' throughout the country.
   ``People have attributed it to policies coming out of Washington
attacking civil rights legislation,'' he said. ``There might be
more to it than that, but a tone set in Washington could increase
the sense among people from underrepresented groups that their
gains are now being assailed.''
   ``In many ways Reagan's eight years ... have taken the shame out
of racist behavior,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who spoke to
4,000 Stanford students on Friday. ``Students tend to follow in
rhythm with the leadership.''
   In recent incidents elsewhere, racial slurs were scrawled on
notes slipped under a door and tacked onto a bulletin board at
Smith College, and members of an all-white white fraternity at
DePauw threw a ``ghetto party'' in which they scrawled racist
grafitti on their house.
   Cheryl Taylor, vice chair of the Black Student Union, argues
that many whites don't understand what is racist, ``so it still
persists, in the country and on the campus. Stanford is not
divorced from society.''
   Despite its image and high tuition, its idyllic campus and links
to the conservative Hoover Institution, 97-year-old Stanford is no
longer simply a bastion for wealthy whites.
   Grants, scholarships and other sources help most students cope
with the $20,000-a-year costs.
   Stanford stepped up admission of minority students 20 years ago,
after the Civil Rights Act, and now more than one-third of its
6,457 undergraduate and 6,767 graduate students from every state
and 100 foreign countries are non-white.
   Altogether, there are 1,378 Asian Americans, 739 blacks, 721
Chicanos, 170 Hispanics, 96 American Indians and 1,834 foreigners.
   ``Our diversity is a fundamental part of the education we
offer,'' Kennedy said, but he acknowledged problems in bringing
together people from different cultures.
   ``We are almost haunted by the fact that despite our best
efforts, we are still vulnerable to the charge that forms of racism
survive here,'' he said.
   Albert M. Camarillo, director of Stanford's Chicano Affairs
Office and chairman of the Committee on Minority Issues, said
``some people with ethnocentric attitudes come to this kind of
environment and feel threatened and want to act out their
resistance to it.''
   Many minority students complain Stanford is not doing nearly
enough to fight bigotry. Most whites agree, but some argue that
blacks are exaggerating the problems and object to branding the
university as racist.
   Keith Archuleta, assistant dean and director of the Black
Community Services Center, said there's something wrong with the
structure at Stanford when ``most of the people of color who we

the dorms.''
   Camarillo's committee has been studying the problems on campus
since last spring and is finalizing ``a very complex set of
recommendations,'' he said.
   ``There are no easy answers,'' he said. ``We're talking about
changes in the undergraduate curriculum, enhancement of ethnic
studies, recruitment and hiring of minority faculty and staff,
social interaction of minorities and non-minorities and student
services.''
   Meanwhile, Stanford students, faculty and administrators are
getting an education in race relations.
   ``We have been alerting people, making them aware that there is
racism on campus and that what happens here does not happen in a
vacuum,'' Dillard said.
   ``This racism is a reflection of society, but it's also a
reflection of the university's being irresponsible,'' she said.
``If you're an intellectual powerhouse, you've got to start pushing
some intellectual power.''

<HEAD>Worker Desperate Over Low Wage Commits Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A factory worker desperate over his
low salary set himself on fire and died, leaving behind written
comments on the country's economic and social crisis, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
   It was the third reported case of self-immolation related to the
plummeting standard of living in Yugoslavia.
   Bogdan Predic, a 49-year-old worker from the northern city of
Zagreb, doused himself with gasoline and set himself ablaze on the
highway linking Zagreb with the northern city of Ljubljana, the
daily Vjesnik said. It said the incident occurred Oct. 19.
   Miladin Kojic, a truck driver from Ljubljana, tried to help the
burning man, the daily said.
   ``I stopped my truck and grabbed a blanket with which I beat the
flames while another truck driver sprayed foam on him,'' Kojic was
quoted as saying.
   An ambulance took Predic to a hospital, where he died several
hours later.
   Several letters found near the scene of the suicide contained
Predic's comments on the country's economic and social crisis,
Vjesnik said.
   Predic worked in a rubber factory and earned about $52 a month,
but two-thirds of his salary was withheld to pay a debt to a
department store, the daily said.
   In two other incidents, a 58-year-old retired worker and a
mechanic also set themselves on fire and died, citing the country's
problems in their final letters, the Belgrade daily Borba reported.
It did not say when or where the two incidents occurred or give the
age of the mechanic.
   The average salary in Yugoslavia is about $100 a month and the
annual inflation rate is 236 percent, accompanied by a 15 percent
unemployment rate and a $21 billion foreign debt.

   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Sunday offered Cabinet posts to two dissident members of his party
who have tried to unseat him.
   Mahathir said Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a former trade minister,
and former Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam could join his Cabinet
as ministers without portfolio. There was no immediate response
from the two politicians.
   ``Because we all wish for unity, and I believe we must be
wholehearted in our efforts to restore unity, I make this
announcement,'' the prime minister told 1,545 delegates attending a
four-day party meeting of his recently formed New United Malays
National Organization.
   Since the country won independence from Britain in 1957, all
Malaysia's prime ministers have come from the original United
Malays National Organization, formed in 1946.
   In April 1987, Razaleigh and Musa narrowly lost party elections
in which they tried to unseat Mahathir and Abdul Ghafar Baba as
party president and deputy president.
   In June 1987, Razaleigh's supporters sought to nullify the
voting in court, alleging that illegal delegates from improperly
registered party branches had voted.
   In February 1988, the High Court declared the elections void and
ruled the party illegal.
   Mahathir formed the New United Malays National Organization on
Feb. 16 and banned Razaleigh, Musa and their followers from
membership, saying their actions had led to the old party being
declared illegal.
   He reversed himself Oct. 15 and invited the opposition leaders
to join the new party.
   Razaleigh and Musa refused, claiming Mahathir had filled key
party posts with his own followers and prevented them from winning
any positions in later elections.
   The United Malays National Organization has governed the country
in a coalition with 12 other parties since 1957.
   The new party, the country's strongest, claims about 1 million
members. The original party had about 1.4 million members.

<HEAD>Denver's Clean Air Campaign Kicks Off on Tuesday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Denver metropolitan area heads into its fifth
annual Better Air Campaign on Tuesday trying to reduce carbon
monoxide levels that are among the highest in the country and
threaten its federal highway funds.
   The campaign, which runs in six counties through Jan. 31, seeks
to get residents to cut back on wood burning and reduce the 3.5
million miles driven daily.
   It will be augmented by state-mandated use of cleaner-burning
oxygenated gasoline between Tuesday and Feb. 28.
   The clean-air campaign aims to reduce average daily carbon
monoxide levels in the mile-high metropolitan area by 15 percent to
19 percent. The oxygenated fuels program is expected to yield an
additional 12 percent reduction.
   Last season's combined effort dropped Denver from first to
seventh place on the Environmental Protection Agency list of worst
cities for carbon monoxide pollution.
   ``We're hoping to get about a 10 percent drop in vehicle miles
driven on a daily basis and also a 60 percent participation rate
throughout the entire metro area on the wood burning part of the
program,'' said Brad Beckham, director of the state Health
Department's Air Pollution Control Division.
   ``If we can get that average daily level down ... we will go a
long way toward meeting federal carbon monoxide standards,''
Beckham said.
   The federal sword hanging over the metro area's head is an EPA
threat to cut off federal highway money if the guidelines are not
met.
   EPA guidelines say carbon monoxide should not exceed 9 parts per
million. In 1970, Denver's levels exceeded that level on 140
occasions. Last winter, Denver exceeded the level only 19 times,
said campaign coordinator Anne Grady.
   ``They have not invoked the sanctions to the Denver metro area
mainly because they think Denver is making reasonable progress in
addressing that problem,'' Beckham said.
   The area's pollution problems are aggravated by the high, thin
air, cold winters and temperature inversions, which trap carbon
monoxide close to the ground. Automobile engines also work less
efficiently at high altitude and emit dirtier exhaust.
   Last season's program achieved about a 17 percent reduction in
carbon monoxide levels _ 10 percent from the no-drive portion and 7
percent from reduced wood burning, said Grady. The two-month
oxygenated fuels program was credited with reducing carbon monoxide
8 percent to 9.5 percent.
   The estimated 1.6 million residents of the six-county area are
being asked not to drive one day a week and to reduce driving
through car pooling and busing.
   In addition, eight cities in the metropolitan area have
mandatory bans on wood burning on high pollution days, and all area
residents will be asked to curtail woodburning.
   A key factor will be the oxygenated fuels, which contain
additives of grain alcohol or ether-based MTBE and made their debut
for a two-month run here last Jan. 1.
   The fuels' oxygen content last time was 1.5 percent. This time,
the oxygen content will be increased to 2 percent. Added oxygen
makes the fuel burn more completely.

   The Age of Aquarius has given way to the age of
acquisition, and love is too busy being a buzz word to steer the
stars.
   Perfect timing, organizers say, for a 20th anniversary
production of ``Hair,'' a play that once symbolized everything '60s
and young.
   ``This is the '80s antidote to `Rambo,''' said '60s guru Timothy
Leary, brought in to help a young cast make sense of ``Hair'' two
decades after it first transformed American theater.
   ``I think it's going to fill a real need.''
   ``Hair,'' the ``American tribal rock musical,'' opened on
Broadway in April 1968 and stayed there for 1,750 performances.
   The new production of the musical opens Tuesday at The Vic
theater.
   The anti-war, anti-establishment message of the musical was a
milestone in American theater 20 years ago, and also marked the
Broadway debut of producer Michael Butler, who also brought
``Lenny,'' the story of comedian Lenny Bruce, to Broadway.
   Butler, the anti-establishment son of a wealthy Illinois family,
stuck with ``Hair'' through most of the '70s, producing it across
the United States and overseas. And he is back, producing and
promoting the new run in Chicago.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's like going back to church,''
Butler said last week. ```Hair' is a very beautiful spiritual
experience. ... I love working with the kids, I love the message.''
   But the kids have changed.
   Many members of the current cast were still in diapers when
protests rocked the streets of America and the original
flower-power tribe sang of love and peace.
   ``I just thought it was all about drugs and something I had no
desire to see,'' said 22-year-old actress Jamie Dawn Gangi, who
plays the role of Crissy in the current $1 million production.
   Executive producer George Millman said the cast had to be taught
what the era was really like.
   ``We talked to the cast a lot,'' he said. ``We find that it's
difficult for them in that they can't feel it in the way that the
people who lived it felt it.''
   And Leary, who met with the cast several times earlier this
month, helped.
   ``About one-third of the cast was very hip and knew what was
going on, but about a third of them didn't have a clue,'' the
68-year-old Leary said from his Los Angeles home.
   ``I hung out with them. Some of them are quite naive about
political and cultural aspects of the period. But I think they're
catching on quickly.''
   The new production, which Millman and Butler hope will spark
spin-offs in other cities, has been changed slightly from the
original.
   The setting is moved from New York to the riot-torn streets of
the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Acoustics and
choreography are a vast improvement over earlier attempts,
producers say.
   This ``Hair,'' Leary says simply, is ``very much like the '80s _
high tech hippy.''

   A man who feared that relatives of a
murder victim were coming after him for retribution telephoned
police Sunday and confessed to the crime, and also asked for
protection, officers said.
   Curtis Pete Anderson, 47, of Brookhaven Township on Long Island,
was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of
Leroy Hughes, 30, of Shirley, said Suffolk County police Officer
Susan Romann.
   Hughes was shot at least twice in the upper torso in front of a
delicatessen Saturday evening, Romann said.
   Police spokeswoman Linda Cicalese said the shooting occurred
after Hughes opened his car door and brushed Anderson with it.
Anderson and Hughes apparently had a continuing feud, she said.
   Hughes managed to walk about a block but then collapsed, she
said.
   A passing motorist found him at an intersection and took him to
Brookhaven Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Romann
said.
   Police became aware of Anderson's possible involvement in the
shooting from interviews with eyewitnesses, and were trying to
locate him when he dialed the 911 emergency number and told
operators that he had killed a man, Romann said.
   Anderson also asked the operator to send police because he
thought members of the victim's family were outside his residence,
she said.
   ``Anderson claims he received phone calls saying there would be
retribution from the family and he feared they would be on his way
over to his house,'' Cicalese said. ``But there seems to be no
credence to his belief that they were outside his residence.''

<TEXT>
   Residents of a subdivision turned out
to help dig up their past as archaeologists began sifting through
tons of dirt at a building site where 4,000-year-old Indian tools
have been found.
   ``It gives us a chance to look back and see part of our
heritage,'' said Jeff McBride, a high school senior earning extra
credit in his geology class by helping with the excavation.
   Alan Leventhal, director of the project under the auspices of
San Jose State University, said the community is getting a chance
to see things most have only heard about before. The volunteers
began helping out Saturday and are expected to continue at the job
for about a month.
   ``Most of them would never even get a look at an excavation and
would hear about one only if there is controversy,'' he said.
   Some of the volunteers are Ohlone Indians, possibly descendants
of the Ohlone tribe that used the site to harvest and prepare food.
   A bulldozer two weeks ago turned up several stone tools,
including mortars and pestles and rocks used for scraping and
drilling.
   The site is probably a half-day's walk from what was the nearest
permanent Ohlone settlement and is in an area where the Indians
would have found an abundance of acorns and game such as antelope
and elk, Leventhal said.
   The ground work for 23 homes has been halted until the
archaeology team finishes.

   A French fishing vessel caught fire
early Sunday, and port authorities said the captain and four
sailors were killed.
   The ship left the port of this northwestern city Saturday after
unloading its cargo, but it soon returned with engine problems.
   Authorities said the fire aboard the Valois killed captain
Adrien Pinards and sailors Joseph Illary, Daniel Derrieu, Oliver
Marel and Eiwan Heno. All were French, but their hometowns were not
available.
   The four sailors were missing shortly after the fire started at
5:50 a.m. Authorities said their bodies were recovered Sunday
afternoon after the fire was put under control.
   The ship's other five crew members were away from the vessel
when it caught fire, officials said.

   Police arrested at least 50 people who gathered in
Moscow and Leningrad on Sunday to demand freedom for hundreds of
people they say are in prisons and psychiatric hospitals for their
beliefs, a dissident said.
   The protests came just days after Soviet officials reportedly
promised to release all political prisoners and after some members
of the Supreme Soviet voted against tougher measures against public
demonstrations.
   Dissidents designated Sunday _ the 16th anniversary of the death
in prison of poet Yuri Galanskov _ as the day on which they would
commemorate Soviet political prisoners.
   Leningrad police arrested 36 protesters who gathered near Kazan
Cathedral along Nevsky Prospekt, said Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman in
Moscow for the Democratic Union, which bills itself as an
alternative to the Communist Party.
   ``They were arrested without basis _ for holding candles and
reading poetry,'' Mityunov said in a telephone interview.
   At least 14 people were arrested in Moscow, he said. No violence
was reported in either city.
   In Moscow, several hundred people milled across the street from
Pushkin Square in the early evening, Mityunov said. Police and
members of a new paramilitary force to control demonstrations used
bullhorns to urge the crowd to disperse but did not interfere with
the heated political discussions.
   One man, told by police to move off a step, proclaimed he had a
right to stand there, marched in place and told a police officer,
``I'm going, I'm going.'' He was not forced to move.
   Mityunov said five members of the Democratic Union were arrested
before they reached Pushkin Square, where they had planned to stage
a demonstration. He said two of the arrested were still held,
including one who raised a banner after most of the crowd left the
area near the square.
   Mityunov said four other members of the Democratic Union who
were arrested on their way to Pushkin Square appeared in court.
   Dissident sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
five members of the Initiative Group for Holding Demonstrations and
Meetings also were arrested near Pushkin Square when they raised
banners in support of political prisoners.
   Last week, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told reporters in
Moscow after meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev that
the Soviet Union promised to release within 10 weeks everyone
regarded in the West as a political prisoner.
   The Soviet Union says it only considers a few dozen people
political prisoners, but Western sources and dissidents estimate
that several hundred people are in prisons, camps, psychiatric
hospitals or exiled from their homes because of their beliefs.
   ``We have very little faith that all political prisoners will be
freed,'' Mityunov said. ``There is a very big difference between
what the authorities promise and what they actually do.''
   On Friday, some members of the Supreme Soviet voted against
decrees giving paramilitary forces broad powers to control
demonstrations and requiring advance approval from authorities for
public protests.
   Although the measures passed easily with 1348 votes, the 31
``no'' votes were the first dissident votes in memory in the
Supreme Soviet.

   Tassos Leivaditis, one of Greece's leading

   Leivaditis' first collection of poems, ``Battle at the Edge of

his collected works was issued last year.
   Critics praised Leivaditis' prolific output of lyric poetry for
its controlled emotions and lively imagery.
   ``I feel shocked at the loss of Tassos Leivaditis ... the
government bows with respect before his contribution and his
works,'' Premier Andreas Papandreou said.
   Culture Minister Melina Mercouri said Leivaditis ``was among the

literature and a presence in our hearts.''
   A state funeral was scheduled Tuesday.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says He's Had Enough of Meetings and Slogans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says he's had
enough of meetings and sloganeering and that it's time for Soviet
society to get down to work.
   Speaking to a gathering of the Young Communist League, or
Komsomol, Gorbachev expressed his impatience with the slow pace of
reform under his policy of perestroika, or restructuring.
   ``Society has been engaging in meetings for too long,'' he said
Saturday. ``Meetings, slogans, and criticisms should be followed by
acts which would set the policy and the entire potential of society
into motion.''
   Gorbachev's remarks were distributed late Saturday by the
official news agency Tass. They appeared to signal the Soviet
leader's impatience to get the country moving rather than any
disenchantment with the more open atmosphere he has fostered.
   His policy of glasnost, or greater openness, has encouraged more
open public debate and a wide-ranging re-evaluation of Soviet
history and future prospects.
   At the same time, his efforts to reform the country's economy
have not yet improved living standards for Soviet citizens,
Gorbachev's stated goal.
   Gorbachev stressed to the young Communists, who were marking the
70th anniversary of their organization, that perestroika will work
only if they work.
   ``What should be done for the processes of perestroika to gather
momentum and unfold on a larger scale? It is essential to do
concrete work in each work collective, in each town and village,
relying on glasnost and democracy, on everthing which has
democratized economic life, and on what is taking place in the
political process of the country,'' he said.
   Gorbachev boosted his position in the Soviet leadership a month
ago by assuming the presidency when Andrei A. Gromyko retired and
by streamlining the Communist Party bureaucracy with his supporters
in key positions.
   He said few oppose his reforms, but that the reforms are
proceeding slowly because people are being asked to find new
approaches and revive values forgotten in the corrupt and stagnant
atmosphere permitted by his predecessors.
   Tass reported that in answer to questions, Gorbachev said the
government is working on a law that will regulate the activities of
volunteer societies and that it probably will be approved next
spring.
   It is likely that independent political organizations like the
People's Front movements that have sprung up in the Baltic
republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia would be included under
such a law.
   Gorbachev said the question of Komsomol membership on the
policy-making Communist Party Central Committee should be
considered soon.
   In answer to another question, Gorbachev rejected procedures for
regulating the social make-up of the Communist Party. The Soviet
leader said an individual's ideas were much more important.

<HEAD>Army Unit Honored For Liberating Nazi Concentration Camp</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Army unit that liberated one of the
Nazi regime's worst concentration camps during World War II was
honored by the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.
   The citation was presented Saturday night at a reunion of former
members of the 20th Armored Division, which liberated Germany's
Dachau extermination camp on April 29, 1945.
   The idea for a citation came from Pat Goitein, of Peoria, Ill.,
the daughter of a division member, tanker Stanley Rea Ostler, who
had hoped to attend the reunion at a Louisville hotel. But her
father died Oct. 13 in North Muskegon, Mich., at the age of 75.
   ``I always knew what they (her father's division) did at
Dachau,'' Mrs. Goitein said. ``When I heard they were having a
reunion, I said, `Daddy, you guys were heroes.' I wanted to see
them get an award from the Holocaust commission. I don't want
people to forget.''
   Dachau, established in 1933, was one of the first concentration
camps the Nazis set up inside Germany. Ten miles from Munich, it
was the site of about 3,500 brutal medical experiments. Thousands
more Jews and political prisoners were executed or died of
starvation and illness. U.S. forces liberated about 32,000
prisoners from the camp.
   Mrs. Goitein was born April 4, 1945, while her father's unit was
on its way toward the camp.
   She said she and her father were working on the citation right
up to his death.
   ``The last thing he said to me was, `Do you have any news?'''
   ``This business has been a very tricky and very personal
thing,'' she said in a telephone interview last week. ``By the time
he died, he knew we had it pretty well lined up, and that really
made him happy.''
   The proclamation, signed by President Reagan and Holocaust
council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, was presented by Rabbi Robert
Slosberg, president of the Louisville Board of Rabbis.
   Retired Army Col. James M. Snyder, the reunion's chief
organizer, accepted the award Saturday night, then handed it to
Fort Knox Chief of Staff Col. Donald W. Williams for submission in
the Patton Museum at Fort Knox.
   Snyder, 74, a major at the time of the liberation, said the
division was moving toward Munich when it came across the camp.
   ``I had no prior knowledge of it (the camp),'' he said. ``I
don't know if anybody had.''
   Snyder said the camp guards surrendered without much resistance.
The division stayed long enough for the military government to take
over the camp, then moved on to Munich.
   He said the GIs had little contact with the prisoners.
   ``They were in horrible shape,'' he said.
   Just after liberating the camp, the division met with an SS
antitank group defending Munich and suffered ``a considerable
number of casualties.'' The unit received a distinguished unit
citation for the engagement.
   Sam Eskenazi, public affairs director for the Holocaust Council
in Washington, said between 12 and 15 units liberated Nazi camps.
Certificates of appreciation have been sent to these units, he
said, and flags of the units have been collected.
   ``There will be a place of honor for these flags at the United
States Holocaust Museum,'' he said. The museum, to be built near
the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., is expected to be
opened in 1992.

   U.N.-mediated peace talks between Iran and Iraq
resume Monday in an effort to consolidate the precarious truce and
disengage troops in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar flew to Geneva
Sunday and said he hoped for substantive progress on an exchange of
prisoners held by the two countries.
   Each country released 25 prisoners of war Sunday but still hold
thousands of others.
   Iraq freed 25 disabled Iranian prisoners and they were flown to
Tehran, the capital of Iran, aboard a plane chartered by the
International Red Cross. Iran reciprocated immediately by releasing
25 Iraqi prisoners who boarded the same plane for the return flight
to Baghdad, Iraq, according to Francoise Derand, a spokesman at the
Red Cross office in Geneva.
   In a brief chat with reporters after his arrival, Perez de
Cuellar said he hoped the meetings in Geneva would be ``if possible
much more useful'' than the 10-day round early this month in New
York.
   Perez de Cuellar last week named withdrawal of the forces as his
first priority in the new negotiations.
   Urgency to his efforts was added by a report warning that forces
``remain in dangerous proximity'' after eight years of fighting
that has killed or wounded an estimated 1.5 million.
   The report by the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group warned
of constant danger of renewed fighting between the two sides, whose
soldiers are separated in some places by only 30 feet.
   A cease-fire has been in effect since Aug. 20.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi
counterpart, Tariq Aziz, have said no progress was made on the
principal issue stalemating the talks since they began in Geneva
Aug. 25 _ the delineation of a border between the two nations.
   Iran says a 1975 treaty set the border in the middle of the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only navigable outlet to the sea.
   Iraq, which rejected the treaty in 1980, demands sovereignty
over the entire waterway.
   Other disputed stretches line the more than 800-mile-long
frontier, according to U.N. sources. They say the discrepancies
have impeded an exact definition of the ``internationally
recognized boundaries'' to which the two countries are to withdraw
under the U.N.-mediated cease-fire.
   The resolution calls for a permament cease-fire, withdrawal of
troops to the pre-war border and the repatriation of POWs.
   Last month, 72 disabled Iraqis were freed by Iran and
repatriated, the first such operation since the cease-fire.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners of war in
Iran and 19,284 Iranian prisoners in Iraq. The United Nations
estimates Iran and Iraq hold a combined total of up to 105,000 POWs.
   Iraq has freed 638 war prisoners and Iran 790, including the 50
released Sunday, according to the Red Cross.

<HEAD>Pinochet Says Foes My Try Again To Kill Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IQUIQUE, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet, who survived a
1986 assassination attempt, said claims by the opposition that he
is the only obstacle to restoring democracy may lead to another
attempt on his life.
   Enemies ``are aiming at me; they have me in the sight,'' the
official Orbe news agency quoted him as saying Sunday.
   On Saturday, Pinochet, 72, spoke to several hundred supporters
in Inquique, 1,150 miles north of Santiago.
   In his first provincial tour since he lost an Oct. 5 referendum
aimed at extending his 15-year rule to 1997, the right-wing army
commander repeated his rejection of opposition demands that he
leave office before his term expires.
   Opposition parties ``claim that I represent the only hurdle for
the restoration of full democracy, and they are trying to separate
me from the armed forces and isolating me,'' Pinochet said.
   ``I publicly warn that these attempts may lead even to my
physical elimination,'' he said.
   Orbe quoted Pinochet as saying Sunday, ``I know they are aiming
at me; they have me in the sight,'' when asked about his reference
to a possible assassination attempt.
   But the news agency said he refused to elaborate. ``That would
be disclosing to them what we already know,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   On Sep. 7, 1986, Pinochet's motorcade was ambushed in the Andes
foothills near Santiago. Five of his bodyguards were killed and 11
wounded. A leftist guerrilla organization claimed responsibility.
   In the referendum, Chileans rejected a proposal by Pinochet and
the other military commanders that he remain in power until 1997.
   According to the 8-year-old constitution, the defeat forces
Pinochet to call an open election, planned for December 1989. He
must hand power to the winner in March 1990.
   But opposition leaders are pressing for constitutional changes,
including a more speedy departure of Pinochet. They say his refusal
to step down and allow earlier elections makes him the only
obstacle to full democracy.
   In his speech Saturday, Pinochet again vowed not to yield to the
opposition demands and said he will strictly follow the
constitution.
   ``No democracy will be possible if we break the law,'' he said.
   Some opposition leaders have said a hard line by Pinochet is
designed to provoke street demonstrations or other radical action
that would justify repression.
   Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup that toppled the elected
government of President Salvador Allende, a Marxist, who died in
the takeover.

<HEAD>Record Lows Around Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures dropped to record lows Sunday around the Great
Lakes, and rain fell over the lower Mississippi Valley.
   A cold air mass influenced much of the Great Lakes states, the
middle and upper Mississippi Valley and the Ohio Valley.
   Clear skies and 3 inches of snow helped thermometers plunge to 2
degrees at International Falls, Minn., the perennial cold spot on
the Canadian border. That was a record low for the city and the
coldest official overnight low in the 48 contiguous states Sunday.
   The low of 20 degrees at Fort Wayne, Ind., broke the city's low
temperature record for the date and tied the record for the month
of October.
   Other records for Oct. 30 were 21 degrees at Chicago's O'Hare
airport; 10 at Duluth, Minn.; 18 at Grand Rapids, Mich.; 18 at
Jackson, Mich.; 13 at Madison, Wis.; 11 at Rochester, Minn.; 20 at
South Bend, Ind.; and 18 at Toledo, Ohio.
   Early afternoon temperatures were only in the 30s in northern
New England, the northern Appalachians, the Great Lakes, and the
upper Mississippi Valley.
   The cold air flowing from the northwest over the warmer water of
Lake Ontario generated ``lake effect'' snow near the lake's
southern shore in New York state. Syracuse received 3 inches of
snow in the six-hour period up to 1 p.m. EST.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over southern Oklahoma,
eastern Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and western Tennessee.
Much of the rainfall was light.
   Light rain and fog was over coastal Washington state. And
showers were scattered over the Florida Peninsula.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 31
degrees at International Falls, Minn., and Saranac Lake, N.Y., to
92 at Palm Springs, Calif.
   For Monday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast for central
and eastern Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast
region, northern Florida and the southern Atlantic Coast states.
Rain also was forecast in western Washington state and extreme
northwestern Oregon. Widely scattered showers were forecast for
Upper Michigan.
   Highs only in the 30s were predicted in northern Maine; in the
40s and 50s over the Appalachians, southern New England, the middle
Atlantic Coast, the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes and the upper and
middle Mississippi Valley; in the 50s from the coast of Washington
state to western Montana; in the 80s over south-central Texas, the
southern half of the Florida Peninsula and over the Rio Grande
Valley; between 80 and 95 over the desert Southwest and inland
valleys of California; and generally in the 60s and 70s over the
remainder of the nation.

   Lots of guys don't like to wear
ties, but for Bill Webb there is a principal _ as well as a school
superintendent _ involved.
   The officials say the high school math teacher is insubordinate.
Webb, who has been suspended three times and may lose his job for
violating the school dress code, counters that it's not what you
wear, but what and how you teach.
   He said officials ought to be more concerned about the biology
classroom, a one-table lab where running water was installed just
four years ago, or the men's faculty lounge, a former restroom
where plywood paneling over the urinals is called a bench.
   ``We've spent over two months on a dress code issue that's not
important, but we have not instituted a single new educational
program for the students of Mason County,'' said Webb, a
jeans-and-cotton-shirt man who also raises cattle.
   But how teachers look is important to county Schools
Superintendent Charles Chambers.
   ``We expect our teachers to set a good example for our children.
If you aren't going to follow the rules set by your school board,
how can you expect your students to follow regulations?'' Chambers
said.
   Webb, 46, has taught upper-level math at Point Pleasant High
School for 20 years, often from college-level textbooks, and once
wore a coat and tie so he could be distinguished from his students.
   ``As I've gotten older, I don't need to make that distinction,
and I don't think I've had a tie on in 15 years,'' said Webb, who
teaches 124 of the 695 students at the school in this rural, Ohio
River county of 28,000.
   Students are more productive in a relaxed atmosphere, Webb said,
explaining that going without a tie helps them relate to him.
   This year, in a memo given to teachers after they had signed
their contracts, Chambers said every male faculty member would have
to wear a tie in class.
   The first time Webb refused, he was suspended for four days with
pay. The next time he was suspended for 11 days without pay. On
Friday, he received another suspension for up to 30 days, beginning
Monday.
   The school board on Nov. 7 will decide whether the latest
suspension is with or without pay. Chambers said Webb is a good
teacher and he would like to see him stay, but not unless he puts
on a tie.
   Three teachers have filed grievances and others tried to make a
mockery of the rule. They wore outlandish ties, some festooned with
clowns, flowers or fish, but they gave way after the board issued
written reprimands.
   Those who reluctantly comply wear black ribbons made by Webb's
daughter and wife.
   Point Pleasant High School's accreditation by the North Central
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools is evidence that
appearance is no indication of what goes on inside, Webb said.
   ``Essentially, it said that in spite of the lack of facilities
they thought we had an effective high school _ and it wasn't
because we were wearing ties,'' Webb said, sitting on the bench in
the faculty room that smells like the boys' bathroom it used to be.
   ``They didn't care what you looked like. They looked to see what
you were doing with your kids,'' Webb said. ``People who normally
lack the capacity to have authority in a classroom could wear a
suit of armor and they still wouldn't be in control.''
   Webb said he is willing to give up teaching and return to his
Gallipolis, Ohio, farm.
   ``I'll probably do some work around home that's been needed done
for some time, and draw unemployment for a while,'' Webb said.
``I'm not sure if I'll stay in education or possibly get a job in
an industrial plant, or even maybe an outdoor job. I can run a
bulldozer.''
   Principal Michael Whalen said he's willing to let Webb go.
   ``You can always be replaced by somebody who can do a better
job,'' Whalen said. ``Once you start thinking you're irreplaceable,
you've got trouble.''

<HEAD>Judge Intervenes in Cocaine Case of Friend's Stepdaughter, Paper
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A municipal court judge intervened
twice this year in other courts to free the stepdaughter of a
wealthy friend in the Guggenheim family, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
   Harbor Municipal Judge Calvin Schmidt countermanded the
decisions by other judges who had decided that Terri Ann McMullen
should post bail on cocaine possession charges, The Register of
Orange County reported.
   Each time Ms. McMullen was freed by Schmidt, she became a
fugitive and was arrested by authorities, the paper said.
   She is now in custody on $250,000 bail awaiting a preliminary
hearing while various authorities investigate Schmidt's role in her
case, the Register said.
   Ms. McMullen, 28, is the stepdaughter of M. Robert Guggenheim
Jr., the great-grandson of turn-of-the-century industrialist Meyer
Guggenheim, the paper said.
   Guggenheim and the judge are close friends and members of the
same social club. They have also participated in the same charity
functions, the Register said.
   Schmidt refused to comment. Guggenheim also refused to comment
except to say, ``The situation is utterly ridiculous.''
   The matter is being investigated by the district attorney and
the state Commission on Judicial Performance, the newspaper said.
   Schmidt first released Ms. McMullen on April 4, after she was
arrested in an Orange motel for alleged cocaine possession.
   Schmidt ordered her release after she signed a promise to appear
in court. Records show she attended three hearings and then
disappeared.
   Ms. McMullen was then arrested on Oct. 4 for investigation of
shoplifting $13 in merchandise from a discount store. Police said
they found 13 grams of cocaine in her purse.
   Schmidt ordered her freed on Oct. 8 against the recommendation
of court officers. When Ms. McMullen missed an Oct. 20 court
appearance on the Orange cocaine charge, Central Municipal Judge
Richard A. Stanford Jr. ordered county marshals to arrest her again
on a $250,000 bench warrant.
   When deputies on Oct. 21 went to locate Ms. McMullen, Guggenheim
told them, ``I thought Cal Schmidt had taken care of these
matters,'' according to a marshals' office report.
   Later that night, after Ms. McMullen had been arrested, she
called her mother, Shirlee Guggenheim, from jail over a phone
equipped with a speaker box.
   Mrs. Guggenheim said, ``I called Cal,'' according to the
marshal's report.
   ``Don't say anything more, Mom, the phone is on a speaker box,''
the daughter said, according to the report.
   After Ms. McMullen's arrest, Stanford entered a message into her
case file saying, ``Bail amount is not to be changed by any
judicial officer, magistrate or judge.''

<HEAD>Jacksonville Mayor: City Will Never Be 100 Percent Odor Free</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacksonville will never be completely
free of bad smells, its mayor admits a year after declaring war on
the polluters that have given this city a malodorous reputation.
   ``I'd like to say we're going to be odor-free,'' Mayor Tommy
Hazouri told The Florida Times-Union in a story published Sunday.
``What may be better said would be an odor-problem free city.''
   A year ago, Hazouri said Jacksonville, saddled with a stinky
reputation for years, would be odor-free in two years. He said
significant progress has been made since then.
   ``We're winning the war,'' he said. ``We have attacked on all
fronts.''
   The city has been tougher on the industries that generate the
unpleasant odors. A city envirnomental ordinance has been
strengthened, citations have been issued against polluters, and
several offenders have been taken to court.
   ``I couldn't ask for any more than what is being done _ short of
putting out a magic wand and saying, `Odor, be gone!''' Hazouri
said.
   However, the newspaper reported that the number of residents who
have complained about odor has increased 91.7 percent in the past
year.
   Jacksonville pollution officials say that finding doesn't
signify that the odors are worse than before. Instead, they said,
it indicates that the public is more aware of the problem and wants
to help by reporting offenders.
   ``When I talk about `odor-free,' I wasn't trying to say we were
going to be 100 percent,'' Hazouri told the paper. ``I'm not by any
means backtracking on what I said.''
   Although every effort is being made to reduce odor, industries
can encounter equipment failures or weather conditions that create
bad smells, Hazouri said.

<TEXT>
   The ``War of the Worlds'' radio drama
about invading Martians unleashed widespread hysteria in 1938, but
similar public manipulation is ``happening all the time'' today,
says writer Garrison Keillor.
   Keillor, creator of the ``Prairie Home Companion'' radio series,
said 1938 was an innocent age compared to the present, when some
jaded, cynical writers and politicians abandon objectivity in order
to entertain with shock value and fear.
   Keillor said his Uncle Jim, a gentle farmer who listened to a
crystal headset radio in the bedroom of his Minnesota farmhouse,
was his only relative who believed the broadcast 50 years ago
Sunday and thought the world was ending.
   Uncle Jim was among up to 1 million Americans who believed the
Halloween eve broadcast of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre of the Air.
   Keillor's ``Prairie Home Companion'' series on American Public
Radio included homespun reports on life in the fictional community
of Lake Wobegon, Minn.
   Sunday ended a four-day celebration of the 50th anniversary of
the ``War of the Worlds'' broadcast by the community randomly
chosen as the setting for the invasion by scriptwriter Howard Koch.
Closing events included a theatrical production of the broadcast.
   Keillor applauded the off-beat celebration.
   ``It's a case of a community who was such a victim of the media
50 years ago to have a chance to come back and exploit its
victimization,'' he said. ``It's a form of justice that's so rare.''
   Keillor joined a psychology professor and a historian Saturday
to examine the question: ``Could it happen again?''
   ``It's happening all the time,'' Keillor said. ``For my Uncle
Jim, panic was an event, and for us it's a way of life.''
   He cited the media's emphasis on entertainment, and its
fascination with the bizarre and perverse.
   He noted Republican presidential candidate George Bush's
campaign commercials that portrayed Democratic candidate Michael
Dukakis as soft on crime by depicting criminals moving through a
turnstile.
   Keillor said ``the engine of our politics'' has become fear of
people who are different, of drugs, and of crime.
   ``Entertainers are after an effect. Journalists have another
code of ethics, and so should politicians.'' They must be faithful
to an objective reality, he said, adding that ``We have to insist
on a difference.''
   Keillor said the ``War of the Worlds'' play by Koch, who later
won an Academy Award for ``Casablanca,'' was ``ethically very
questionable.''
   Howard Green, a state historian and expert on Depression-era
history, said the broadcast worked because radio was a trusted and
comfortable medium during tumultuous times.
   He said the stock market crash, the depression, technological
leaps, the threat of war and Adolf Hitler's rise to power bred
insecurity, fear and shame.
   ``There was fear, and there was radio,'' Green said. ``The radio
was a source of comfort and security ... in an upside down,
topsy-turvy, scary world.''
   Joel Cooper, Princeton University's psychology chairman, said
1938 was a period of free-floating anxiety over economic and world
events, and the broadcast provided a specific event to which people
could respond with an exact emotion _ fear.
   He said the show included credible commentators and realistic
news bulletins, allowing listeners to abandon critical judgment and
believe.
   ``These are the same tactics used to sell us our toothpaste, our
diet pills and our presidential candidates,'' Cooper said.

<HEAD>Ms. Bhutto Begins Election Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan
Peoples Party, opened her campaign Sunday for the Nov. 16 elections
for the National Assembly.
   She started her campaign in Karachi's Lyari slum district.
   ``We are going to win,'' she told a cheering crowd. ``The days
of injustice to the poor will end on Nov. 16.''
   The main opposition to Ms. Bhutto's party is the Islamic
Democratic Alliance of nine center-right parties including the
Pakistan Muslim League of former Prime Minister Mohammad Khan
Junejo. Some of the alliance members are already on the campaign
trail.
   Voters will elect 217 members to the National Assembly on Nov.
16. Three days later they will cast ballots for 460 members of the
legislative assemblies of the provinces of Punjab, Sind,
Baluchistan, and the North-West Frontier.
   The late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq dissolved the National
Assembly and provincial legislatures on May 29 and dismissed
Junejo. He accused the legislators of incompetence and failing to
uphold law and order.
   Zia, an army general who seized power in a military coup in
1977, was killed Aug. 17 in the crash of a C-130 transport plane.
Among others killed in the crash were the U.S. ambassador and an
American military adviser.
   Although sabotage was suspected, the cause of the crash is still
under investigation.
   In the 1977 coup, Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged two years later after being
convicted of conspiracy in the killing of a political opponent.
   A caretaker government led by former Senate Chairman Ghulam
Ishaq Khan took over after Zia's death and promised to carry out
his policies including the elections.
   Zia declared that candidates in the elections had to run as
individuals unaffiliated with any political party, but that was
overruled by the Supreme Court on Oct. 2. It said candidates could
run on party tickets, and that decision was expected to help Ms.
Bhutto's party.

   Michael Dukakis bragged Sunday about the
liberal tradition, claimed that George Bush was ``dead wrong'' in
saying Dukakis wanted to divide the country and challenged his
rival to a debate on the eve of the election.
   ``I'm going to be a president who unites America,'' Dukakis told
reporters during a daylong train trip through California's Central
Valley. ``If he wants to talk about that, then I'd be happy to meet
him face-to-face.''
   That showdown, Dukakis said, could take place election eve
during the hour of network television time purchased by the
Democratic and Republican campaigns for last-minute appeals to
voters. A moderator would be present but the candidates _ not
reporters _ would ask the questions.
   Dukakis, convinced his campaign is surging in the waning days of
the election contest, delivered an impassioned defense of
liberalism, a subject he has largely ducked.
   ``We need a president in the tradition, yes the liberal
tradition, of Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy,'' Dukakis told a
depot rally in Hanford, a valley community surrounded by sprawling
cotton farms.
   He repeated that call at similar rallies in Bakersfield and
Fresno, adding former President Harry S. Truman to his list of
liberal Democrats at those stops.
   At the Fresno news conference, Dukakis said he decided ``it was
time to set the record straight'' after President Reagan said last
week that if Truman was alive today he would support Bush and the
GOP.
   Dukakis scoffed at Reagan's statement and said his fiscal
conservatism and concern for children, health care, education, the
environment and average families put him squarely in the mold of
Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy.
   ``That's the tradition of liberalism I grew up in,'' Dukakis
said. ``That's the tradition I believe in. And I'm not going to let
the Republican Party pervert that word and give it a meaning it
doesn't have.''
   In an interview with the ``MacNeil@Lehrer Newshour,'' Dukakis
said he objected to the manner in which Bush has used the term to
describe his opponent.
   ``A way which I think is very deliberately designed to suggest
that I and people like me don't have a sense of values, that we're
kind of permissive, that anything goes,'' he said in the interview
taped Saturday and scheduled to air Monday night.
   Yet at the Sunday news conference, Dukakis refused to add less
popular liberals _ George McGovern, Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale
_ to his list.
   ``I'm not going to go through a litany of people'' who share
that tradition, Dukakis said when asked about the latter group of
Democrats. He did, however, refer to a recent joint appearance with
Carter.
   Dukakis drew large and enthusiastic crowds at each of the depot
rallies, taking time during each to speak in Spanish to the large
number of Hispanics in the crowds.
   As Dukakis adopted a more combative tone in his trip through
California _ he promised an administration with ``more backbone''
than the current one _ his campaign also was fighting back with new
ads attacking the Republican environmental record. One commericals
shows two beachgoers wearing gas masks with an oil rig just
offshore.
   Recent public opinion polls show Dukakis closing fast on Bush in
several key states including California, a must-win state where
Dukakis aides said an 11-point Bush lead a week ago has shrunk to a
virtual tie.
   Nationwide, a Time magazine poll taken last week showed Bush
maintaining a 10-point lead. But Dukakis aides said more recent
tracking data showed the gap had narrowed to as little as six
points.
   Assessing the campaign and its issues on NBC's ``Meet the
Press,'' Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., a prominent Bush ally, suggested
that the Republican nominee's hard-and-fast promise not to raise
taxes may be unrealistic.
   Dole, a former GOP presidential primary opponent of the vice
president, said he believed a federal budget can be worked out next
year that could avoid increases in individual income tax rates. But
he noted that Bush had made a sweeping vow not to raise federal
revenues.
   ``That's going to be a hard thing to accomplish,'' said Dole, a
former chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee.
``Maybe he can do it. I hope he can. I want to help him, and I'll
be glad to support him and lead the effort. But I wouldn't say
there's a 100 percent chance we can do it.''
   Dole also was asked whether Bush was continuing to dodge
questions _ which Dole had asked during his primary campaign _
about the Iran-Contra affair and U.S. relations with Panama's
indicted military leader, Manuel Noriega.
   ``Well, I don't know,'' Dole said. ``I don't know what he does
know. Only he knows, and maybe he'll tell us some day.''
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, in a
statement released by the Dukakis campaign, said Dole's comments
reminded him of Bush's vow not to raise taxes.
   ``What he (Bush) really means is `Read my lips, I'll say what it
takes to get elected,''' Bentsen said.
   Responding to Dole's comments about taxes, the vice president
told reporters: ``He knows what I said and what I believe and I'm
just going to do my best. But first, I want to win this election.
That's the key.''
   Bush attended a private mass at the residence of Cardinal John
Krol and later visited Italian-American supporters in suburban
Norristown.
   His chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said the Bush campaign will
concentrate in its final week on states where the margin is close,
including Ohio, California and Illinois.
   Unlike his boss, Fuller did not dispute that the race was
narrowing, but he said it was not a matter for concern.
   ``I think it's to be expected as you get to the final days of
the campaign that you're going to see some tightening in this
race,'' Fuller said. ``But that's going to cause to us to work
harder. We'll not allow ourselves to lose the edge we've had as a
campaign team.''
   Dukakis held Bush personally responsible for Republican campaign
literature being circulated in Maryland that pictured Dukakis
standing next to Willie Horton Jr., the convicted murderer who
raped a Maryland woman and slashed her fiance after he escaped from
a Massachusetts prison furlough.
   The fund-raising letter asks, ``Is this your pro-family team for
1988?''
   Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III, appearing on the
CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' repudiated the flier and said it was
``totally out of bounds and totally unauthorized.''
   Baker said it was not Bush's fault. ``You cannot control every
party organization throughout the country,'' he said.
   Bush planned to make several television appearances this week,
including taping an interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw on Monday and
appearing live on the NBC ``Today'' show on Thursday, said
spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   Baker said the campaign also is considering invitations for Bush
and his vice presidential running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana,
to be interviewed by CBS anchorman Dan Rather.

   Three tickets were sold with the six
numbers needed to win California's $60.8 million lottery jackpot,
the largest in the world, officials said Sunday.
   Each of the tickets is worth a third of the jackpot. A pool of
15 hospital workers in San Diego County jubilantly claimed Sunday
that it held one of the winning tickets. However, lottery spokesman
Bob Taylor said he could not confirm that until the ticket stub is
verified, probably on Monday.
   The two other tickets with the six winning numbers were
purchased in Westminster in Orange County and in Sacramento, Taylor
said. Winners in those areas had not come forward.
   Workers at Fallbrook Hospital told The Associated Press they
went together to purchase $600 worth of tickets.
   Carrie Dragon, a 38-year-old pharmacy technician, said she
joined 13 nurses, lab technicians and other hospital employees, as
well as a friend of one worker, in putting $40 each toward the
tickets.
   She said all agreed they would split what winnings came from the
``Quick Pick'' tickets. ``Quick Pick'' means that the numbers were
selected at random by one of the computerized lotto terminals.
   The tickets were purchased at a Circle K convenience store, she
said. Lottery officials verified that the winning ticket in
Fallbrook was purchased at a Circle K.
   The hospital workers in the pool held a party to watch Saturday
night's drawing.
   ``The lady who found we had a winning ticket screamed,'' said
Dragon. ``Everybody was just amazed. Then everybody started
dreaming about what we were going to do with the money.
   ``I'm going to set up trust funds for my four kids and pay off
bills,'' she said. ``But for Thanksgiving, we're all going to go to
Hawaii, or some place like that.''
   She said the ticket was placed in a bank vault.
   Lottery spokeswoman Susan Kossack said each winner will receive
$20,296,175, a third of the $60,888,525 jackpot, in installments
over 20 years. The installments will amount to $810,666 annually
after taxes, she said.
   If verified, the hospital pool ticket would be worth more than
$67,600 annually before taxes for 20 years to each of the 15
people. The lottery pays out only to a single winner, the person
holding the winning ticket. Arrangements for dividing the money
would be the responsibility of the group.
   Dragon said two hospital workers, Duff Stone and Charlie Jett,
bought the tickets for the group. An unidentified woman who
answered the telephone at Stone's home said reporters would have to
wait to talk to the winners at a lottery office on Monday.
   The winning numbers selected in the televised Saturday night
drawing were: 5, 20, 26, 28, 32, and 39. The bonus number was 3.
   The jackpot was the world's largest lottery prize, according to
Taylor.
   The previous world record jackpot was $56 million in Spain's El
Gordo lottery in 1983, according to Sam Valenza, publisher of
Lottery Players magazine in Moorestown, N.J. But in Spain's
lottery, players don't choose their numbers, which are already
printed on tickets, and several winning entries are guaranteed in
each of the five or six drawings held each year.
   The previous North American record was a $55.16 million jackpot
in a Florida lottery last month. That prize went to a single winner.
   Saturday's California drawing climaxed a week of frenzied lotto
ticket buying throughout the state, with gamblers wagering about
$106 million, Taylor said.
   ``All these figures are records,'' Kossack added.
   Saturday's sales hit $39.5 million, officials said. At 6:32 p.m.
Saturday, the high sales point, more than 86,000 tickets were being
sold each minute. In the heaviest hour, from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Saturday, about 4.3 million of the $1 tickets were sold.
   The Saturday jackpot soared because on Wednesday, for the fourth
consecutive time, nobody picked the six winning numbers between 1
and 49. Wednesday's $33.4 million jackpot was rolled over to the
Saturday game and grew with each ticket sale.
   Residents of Nevada, which has legalized gambling but no state
lottery, accounted for some of the sales, officials said.
   The busiest store Saturday was in the Sierra Nevada community of
Truckee, 20 miles southwest west of Reno, Nev., with sales of
$47,652.
   For the week, the busiest retailer was a store in Baker, 80
miles southwest of Las Vegas, that has only one lotto sales
terminal but logged $162,014 in sales.
   Lottery tickets with five winning numbers plus the bonus number
will pay $261,977 each to 29 players, while five numbers without
the bonus will pay $3,742 each to 1,046 players, said Taylor.

   A farmer representing Tennessee in the
1,000-mile Trail of Tears commemorative wagon train says he is
having to drop out of the project because state officials failed to
keep a promise of financial aid.
   State officials said no one promised any money.
   Norman Fowler, of Camden, said he returned home last week after
entering Missouri because he simply couldn't afford to go on.
   ``The state said they would fund a Tennessee train, so I said I
would do it,'' Fowler said. ``They kept saying to stay with it and
the money would come, but it never did.''
   The wagon train set out Sept. 17 from Red Clay, Tenn., for
Talequah, Okla., to mark the 150th anniversary of the forced
removal of Cherokee Indians from their homes in the East. By the
journey's end, the train will have traveled through those states
plus Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas.
   Luvenia Butler, executive director of the Tennessee Indian
Commission, said Sunday no state official ever promised Fowler
financial aid.
   ``He was a diabetic and he was getting sick and because there
was no money, he physically wanted to come home,'' Butler said.
``No one on the behalf of the state of Tennessee has ever promised
Norman Fowler a penny.''
   She said one of the organizers of the project had promised
Fowler the state would help.
   Fowler said he used about $2,000 of his own money and $1,000 in
contributions, but needs about $8,000 to finish the journey, which
is scheduled to end Dec. 3.
   ``I would like to rejoin them, and it's a shame Tennessee won't
be represented,'' he said. ``But it gets expensive trying to keep
up the wagon and animals, plus buying food and all.''
   Felix Barnes of Nashville, national chairman of funding for the
wagon train project, said he set up an account at Sovran Bank in
Nashville to collect money for Fowler.
   ``It's unfortunate that he has to come home due to lack of funds
after the governor of the state declared this year the year of the
Native American Indian,'' Barnes said. ``Norman was losing $800 a
week pay to do this and using his own money because he had pride in
the project.''
   Barnes said other wagoners periodically join the train, with as
many as 40 wagons in the group at some times. He estimated that
about 200 wagons would take part in the wagon train by the time the
journey is over.

<HEAD>Winning Sisters Had Offered $1 Million, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANTOWN, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two sisters who shared a $31.5 million
Florida Lottery jackpot have suddenly found themselves slapped with
a lawsuit by the ex-husband of one of the women, and the man says
all the money is his.
   Ellen Snipes and Maxine Johnson produced the winning ticket for
the Oct. 22 drawing. They had made a weekly routine of playing the
Lotto, contributing $5 each every week.
   But Lewis Snipes argues that he bought and paid for the winning
Lotto ticket, and his attorney filed a suit Friday saying his
client deserves the whole jackpot, the state's third-largest.
   The sisters, unnerved by the first legal battle over Florida
Lotto winnings since the weekly drawing began last spring, have
left Indiantown for security reasons, attorney Tim Morell said
Saturday. He represents Mrs. Snipes and Mrs. Johnson and her
husband Bill.
   By all accounts, Snipes coaxed his ex-wife into playing the game
Oct. 22, picked numbers off her old paycheck stub and drove to a
store to buy the tickets. His suit says he bought $15 worth of
tickets for himself, then made a special trip to buy, with his own
money, $10 worth of tickets for his ex-wife and her sister.
   Morell said Mrs. Snipes realizes her ex-husband was the driving
force behind her multimillion-dollar windfall.
   The sisters offered Snipes more than $1 million, their attorney
said, but he said the sisters did so out of gratitude, not legal
obligation.
   ``He would have been a wealthy man. But that wasn't enough,''
Morell said.
   The Snipeses were married in 1980 and divorced in 1982, but
friends and family say they remain close. As recently as Tuesday,
when the Johnsons and Snipeses went to Tallahassee to verify the
winnings, their relationship was amicable.
   But by the end of the week, Snipes' attorney, Andrew Coutant,
had asked Martin County Circuit Court for an emergency order to
stop distribution of the money until a settlement is reached.
   The first of 20 annual payments of $1,570,000 is scheduled to be
wired to the First National Bank of Indiantown on Wednesday.
   ``It's frightening what happens when you get into this sort of
thing,'' Morell said. ``You want your life to be the same. But
that's just not the way it is.''

   Vandals broke into the building that
houses the Vermont campaign offices of Democrat Michael Dukakis,
and put up bumper stickers that said ``Smart Democrats Vote
Republican,'' a campaign official said Sunday.
   The Dukakis campaign offices themselves were not entered, but 15
to 20 bumper stickers were put on walls in the halls, and posters
were ripped down and cut in half, said state campaign head Andre
Oliver.
   ``I don't think this type of thing is called for,'' Oliver said.
``In terms of negative campaigning, it certainly should be
stopped.''
   Oliver discovered the vandalism at the Burlington building early
Sunday and discussed the incident with Bush campaign representative
Steve Watson, who said the Bush campaign had nothing to do with it.
   Watson said he and Oliver agreed that sometimes it may be
difficult to ``contain the enthusiasm'' of campaign volunteers.
Watson said he and Oliver would urge their volunteers not to engage
in such behavior.

<TEXT>
   An army of 20,000 citizen volunteers joined city
employees Sunday in patrolling the streets to combat the outbreak
of arson that has become traditional here on the night before
Halloween, dubbed Devil's Night.
   Elsewhere, fights broke out and beer cans flew during a two-day
pre-Halloween festival in Carbondale, Ill., where police arrested
nearly 200 people.
   The volunteer force, including members of 46 citizens band radio
clubs, block clubs and other organizations, was twice as large as
the group of volunteers deployed in the past few years, said Robert
Berg, a spokesman for Mayor Coleman A. Young.
   The volunteers joined 750 Department of Public Works employees
and 150 department heads, staff members and other mayoral
appointees patrolling Detroit streets in city vehicles equipped
with fire extinguishers, Berg said.
   ``They're not going to enter a burning building,'' Berg said of
the city workers. ``But they can use the fire extinguishers to put
out fires in Dumpsters and the like.''
   A 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew for children 18 and under took effect
Saturday night and would continue through Tuesday night. Police
picked up 278 minors Saturday night on curfew violation charges,
Buck said.
   Last year, police arrested 496 youths who defied a similar
curfew to wander the streets.
   The number of deliberately set fires during the Devil's Night
weekend would not be available until Tuesday or Wednesday, Berg
said. He said the Detroit Fire Department handles 65 to 70 fires on
an average Saturday night.
   No arson-related arrests were reported Friday or Saturday, said
Sgt. Christopher Buck, a police spokesman.
   The pre-Halloween arson binge first erupted in 1984 with 810
fires that killed one person and left dozens homeless. The number
of fires has declined each year since then; last year 290 fires
were started during the two-day holiday weekend.
   Young said he hoped the army of arson stoppers and anti-Devil's
Night publicity would douse the dangerous tradition.
   Children wanting to go treat-or-treating Monday must be
accompanied by a parent or legal guardian, police said.
   In Illinois, more than 15,000 people, including thousands of
students from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale and other
area colleges, roamed closed streets Friday and Saturday nights for
the annual Halloween Festival Days, said Carbondale police Sgt.
William Holmes.
   A total of 192 people, many in costume, were arrested by the
festival's end at 4 a.m. Sunday. One stabbing was reported but the
victim was not seriously injured, and most of the arrests were for
underage drinking or reckless conduct, police said.

   A New York man took top honors Sunday in an
orchestral competition for American composers, winning $5,000 in
the 11th annual Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards.
   Christopher Rouse of Fairport, N.Y., won first prize for his
Symphony No. 1, commissioned for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra
and first performed in Baltimore last January.
   Ninety-six works had been submitted for the 1988 competition, of
which the top four compositions were performed Sunday at the
Kennedy Center Concert Hall. A three-member jury made its final
rankings on the four entries after the performance.
   Second prize went to George Rochberg of Square, Pa., who was
awarded $2,500 for his Symphony No. 6, commissioned for the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra by the Pennsylvania Council on the
Arts.
   Third prize of $1,000 was awarded to Stephen Paulus, of St.
Paul, Minn., for his Violin Concerto, commissioned by the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra.
   Fourth prize of $500 was awarded to Joan Tower, of New York
City, for her ``Silver Ladders,'' commissioned by the St. Louis

   The awards are named for the late Arthur Friedheim, a pianist,
composer and teacher, and were established by the Kennedy Center
and the Eric Friedheim Foundation in 1978.

   An empty beer keg thrown onto a campfire
exploded Sunday, killing a man at his birthday party in the second
such death reported this month.
   Chris John Widebech, who turned 21 on Friday, had been with more
than a dozen friends from his hometown, Northborough, Mass., when
the aluminum keg exploded at 12:45 a.m. and a piece struck him in
the head, said Danbury Police Chief Stephen Corsetti.
   Widebech died at the scene. Nobody else was injured.
   Corsetti said the friends had gathered for the weekend at a
cottage owned by Phillip Giroux, 26, of Northborough. His birthday
also was Friday.
   ``The weekend was planned as a birthday celebration for the two
individuals,'' Corsetti said.
   Corsetti would not say who put the keg into the fire. It wasn't
Widebech, though he was standing near the fire and knew the keg was
in there, Corsetti said.
   Some of the people at the party fled after the accident, but
when police arrived 11 remained, three or four of whom were under
21 years old, Corsetti said. He said Giroux was charged with
illegally providing them alcohol.
   A 22-year-old man was killed in Albany, N.Y., on Oct. 24 when a
beer keg placed on a bonfire exploded. A piece of metal severed the
spinal cord of Patrick Viola of Niskayuna, N.Y.
   In that case, officials said the fire caused a quart of beer
that remained in the keg to boil, and steam and pressure built up
until the keg exploded.

   Two Navy Tomahawk anti-ship cruise
missiles launched from ships off Southern California during the
weekend flew hundreds of miles to target ships and were recovered,
an official said Sunday.
   A fully guided missile was launched at 2:45 p.m. Sunday, flew
about 250 miles to a target hulk and went on to a recovery area on
San Clemente Island,said Ray Lucasey, spokesman for the Pacific
Missile Test Center.
   Another missile was launched at 2:50 p.m. Saturday and flew a
similar mission against another target hulk, Lucasey said.
   ``They were successful in terms of their launching on time and
recovery but we like to do in-depth studies of the launches before
we determine whether the entire mission was a success,'' Lucasey
said.
   The Tomahawk anti-ship missile can inflict heavy damage with its
single conventional warhead. Its wide-area search capability
enhances the ability to successfully target and attack enemy ships,
Lucasey said.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Sunday criticized a book
written by a former police commissioner who once led the
investigation into the assassination in 1986 of Prime Minister Olof
Palme.
   The newspaper Expressen carried a report based on information
from Hans Holmer's book ``Olof Palme Is Shot,'' which is scheduled
for distribution soon.
   Holmer resigned as police commissioner late in 1986 during
disputes with prosecutors about the fruitless search for Palme's
killers.
   Formal inquiries claimed police blunders had hampered the
investigation, and some prosecutors said the police commissioner
had too much influence over the case.
   ``In a murder investigation it is necessary to have secret
material,'' said Ingvar Eriksson, spokesman for the units now
involved in the investigation.
   ``It makes it easier to check witness accounts,'' he said.
``Here we have material never published before. We would have
preferred it if he had never written that book.''
   Prosecutor Jorgen Almblad, who is participating in the
investigation, said one problem with the book is it might give
people the wrong idea about the status of the case.
   ``Holmer's book could make many believe that what he writes is
actually what the investigation is concentrating on,'' Almblad told
Swedish national radio.
   The Exressen account deals with a 30-hour period before Palme
was shot to death while walking with his wife along a street in
downtown Stockholm on Feb. 25, 1986.
   Holmer wrote about information given by people questioned in the
case, with some identified by name.
   He describes a carefully planned plot by a small group and
claims Palme was shadowed by a muscular blond man the day before
the murder.
   According to Holmer, members of the group had been waiting for
weeks for the right moment, and when Palme walked unguarded with
his wife Lisbet to a theater, ``the conditions were perfect. They
had two hours to plan the murder.''
   Holmer wrote that a gunman and accomplices with walkie-talkie
radios and escape cars were waiting as the Palmes left the the
theater and the killer came up from behind them, shot the prime
minister and fled down a dark side street.
   Police sources said recently investigators were following
several leads, including the possibilty that an insane man
operating along might have killed Palme.

<HEAD>Afghanistan's President Seeks International Talks On
Demilitarization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Afghanistan's Soviet-backed
government called for an international conference to oversee the
complete demilitarization of his country, which has been torn apart
by a 10-year civil war, Tass reported.
   The Soviet news agency said President Najib, in a speech
Saturday to the National Council, or parliament, also dismissed
reports that he would step down soon.
   ``Taking into consideration that a large amount of various
weapons have accumulated in the country over the 10 years of war,
and with a view to establishing a lasting peace, such a conference
can discuss the question of demilitarization of the republic of
Afghanistan,'' Tass said in a dispatch late Saturday.
   Najib called for ``the gathering of all weapons available there
and their transfer to the respective producer countries,'' Tass
said.
   Najib requested that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar prepare for a conference.
   Najib's Soviet-back government is fighting U.S.-backed
anti-Marxist insurgents operating from bases in neighboring
Pakistan.
   In a separate report, Tass quoted the official Afghan news
agency Bakhtar as saying 170 guerrillas were killed in recent
fighting with government soliders.
   The Soviet Union sent soldiers to Afghanistan in December 1979,
who replaced one pro-Soviet government with another and then
remained to fight the insurgents.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement signed in Geneva on April 14,
the 100,000 Soviet soldiers are to be withdrawn by Feb. 15. Half
the force was removed by Aug. 15. But the Soviet Union and
Afghanistan accuse the United States and Pakistan of violating a
pledge in the Geneva agreement to stop interfering in Afghanistan.
   Najib told the parliament his country would request an urgent
meeting of the U.N. Security Council ``to consider the question of
the threat to the territorial integrity and national sovereignty
... which has developed as a result of Pakistan's interference and
violation of the Geneva agreements.''
   An international conference also could ``endorse and consolidate
Afghanistan's status as a non-aligned and neutral country,''
develop a program of economic and humanitarian aid and work out
guarantees for the observance of human rights, Najib said.
   Tass said Najib ``strongly dismissed'' rumors that he would
resign soon, saying he ``would never abandon the work for peace and
security.''
   Western diplomats have reported rumors in recent weeks that
Najib might be forced to step down by the Soviets to pave the way
for a government headed by a figure not connected with the ruling
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Soviet and Afghan officials have said they believe that a
neutral political leader might encourage a truce with the Moslem
insurgents, who have refused any power sharing deals with the
Communists.
   Najib also reportedly is threatened from within his own party in
the traditional rift between his urban Parcham wing and the rural
Khalq which dominates the military.
   Tass quoted Bakhtar as saying government soldiers routed three
bands of guerrillas in the area of Tur Kotal on Friday, killing 70
and wounding more than 100.
   Another 100 insurgents were killed in fighting in Kunduz and
Nangarhar provinces, Tass said.
   It quoted Bakhtar as saying two American, five Pakistani and
five people from unidentified Arab countries who were advising the
rebels were killed. It did not elaborate.
   Insurgent groups have been stepping up pressure on provincial
capitals and on the national capital Kabul itself as the Soviet
soldiers withdraw and Afghan government forces are left to defend
the cities. Shelling and rocket attacks have increased dramatically.
   U.S. officials in Washington said Saturday that the Soviet Union
may be violating the Geneva agreement by deploying up to 30
high-performance MiG-27 ground support planes in western
Afghanistan.
   The U.S. officials said the Soviet Union has pledged only to
protect its own soldiers from attack, but that the MiG-27s can be
used for offensive operations.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebels Say They Killed Seven Government Troops And Two

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola's UNITA rebels said Sunday they
killed two Cuban and seven Angolan soldiers in a commando operation
in the central city of Huambo.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
said in a statement distributed in Lisbon that three workshops,
three arms dumps and two fuel deposits were destroyed in the raid
Wednesday.
   But the official Angolan news agency ANGOP, apparently referring
to the same attack in a report monitored in Lisbon on Saturday,
said a bomb planted by UNITA in Huambo on Wednesday killed two
civilians and partially destroyed a house, two warehouses and a
printing shop.
   UNITA, backed by South Africa and the United States, has been
fighting since 1975 to force the Soviet- and Cuban-backed Angolan
government to share power.
   UNITA also said it used a bomb Wednesday to destroy a train
carrying arms in the southwestern province of Huila. It said 532
civilians held by government troops were freed in a rebel attack
Tuesday in northern Malange province.
   In a separate development, the independent Portuguese weekly
Expresso Saturday quoted an unidentified, well-informed source in
the Angolan capital, Luanda, as saying South African forces were
preparing a military operation against southern Angola aimed at
recovering air supremacy in the region.
   The report said South African forces would be equipped with
long-range artillery and sophisticated Lavi aircraft. It said South
African forces lost superiority in the air when fighting
Cuban-backed Angolan forces for the strategic southern town of
Cuito-Cuanavale this year.
   The report could not be confirmed.
   South Africa forces, which have fought in southern Angola in
support of UNITA, withdrew across the border into South
African-ruled South-West Africa at the end of August as part of
cease-fire agreement that emerged from U.S.-mediated peace talks
among Angola, Cuba and South Africa.
   UNITA is not participating in the talks and is not a party to
the cease-fire.

<HEAD>John Patrick Shanley's `Italian American Reconciliation' Opens
Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned; `the dreamer examines his pillow' CQ 3rd
graf.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Life with Janice meant heartache, screaming, bad
food and a dead dog.
   Still, Huey Maximilian Bonfigliano wants an ``Italian American
Reconciliation'' with his ex-wife, even after that last straw _ her
shooting of his favorite pooch with a zip gun. It's also the title
of John Patrick Shanley's promising if messy romantic comedy which
opened Sunday at Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II.
   Shanley's plays always have generated more heat than light.
Romantic warfare has been at the center of his ``Danny and the Deep
Blue Sea,'' a dramatic apache dance that ends with two exhausted
lovers; ``Savage in Limbo,'' a blue-collar battle in a Bronx bar,
and ``the dreamer examines his pillow,'' a three-character struggle
between a father, his daughter and her boyfriend.
   Shanley's latest effort takes place in a romanticized Little
Italy where people always seem to be slurping minestrone and where
Perry Como, Mario Lanza and Puccini play in the background. If you
think the setting sounds a little like the movie ``Moonstruck,''
you're right. Shanley won an Oscar for his screenplay. Only
``Italian American Reconciliation'' doesn't have the steady hand of
director Norman Jewison to guide it through its shakiest moments.
   The play focuses on Huey's attempt to win back Janice with the
help of his best friend, Aldo Scalicki. Aldo serves as the play's
narrator, bantering with the audience before the lights go down and
explaining the dramatic situations before they happen. He's also
one of the play's problems. He's more interesting than any of the
people he is talking about, particularly because of John Turturro's
winning performance that mixes macho and meekness.
   Huey is something of a cipher, while Janice is something of a
psychotic. It's not the fault of actors John Pankow and Jayne
Haynes that their characters simply are not as compelling and
believable as the person who tells their story.
   There are other, better written plot complications.
   Before he can reconcile with Janice, Huey must dump Teresa, a
pretty waitress who really loves him. Aldo thinks Huey should stay
on with Teresa so he decides to seduce Janice himself. The
attempted seduction is played out on a moonlit, ivy-covered balcony
designed by Santo Loquasto. The scene provides Turturro with a
great opportunity to display some terrific physical comedy.
   As Teresa, Laura San Giacomo possesses a sweetness that would
seem to make her a clear winner in any contest with the shrewish
and violent Janice. Teresa is guided in her dealings with Huey by
her Aunt May played by a wonderful character actress named Helen
Hanft.
   Shanley has an ear for argument. His banter is tough and often
funny. He can make exasperation sound like fun. There is one
blissful moment in the second act when Aunt May and Aldo discuss
his fear of women. Characters and dialogue mesh for an inspired bit
of lunacy as Aunt May tells him how to overcome his problem.
   But the author also directed the play, and he allows it to
ramble, particularly in the opening scenes when Huey expounds on
his romantic dilemma to Aldo. It doesn't work. And Janice's
severity is never explained adequately. Shanley chalks up her
troubles to her father _ the same source of Aldo's problems _ but
the explanation is never convincing for such a strong-willed woman.
   There still is work to be done on ``Italian American
Reconciliation.'' The playwright has created an affectionate and
atmospheric tale of the search for love. But his searchers need to
be more defined and persuasively drawn before it can be considered
a complete success.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top-ranking
military commander, Gen. Adolfo Blandon, said he is stepping down.
His replacement is a combat veteran popular with U.S. military
advisers.
   Blandon said late Saturday that he will be succeeded by Col.
Rene Emilio Ponce, a 41-year-old brigade commander.
   Ponce was singled out as an exceptional commander by four U.S.
Army lieutenant colonels earlier this year in a Harvard fellowship
analysis of the Salvadoran civil war.
   He has said victory in that war will go to those who gain the
loyalty of the poor.
   ``We cannot think that solely by military means we are going to
resolve this war,'' Ponce said this year. ``Even if we kill all the
subversives, the problem will not end. Such deplorable
socio-economic conditions would remain that it (insurgency) could
easily revive.''
   Blandon, 48, said he was appointed El Salvador's military
attache in France, effective Nov. 1. Named head of the joint chiefs
of staff in November 1983, he had been expected to step down by
year's end.
   He made his announcement in a local television interview
broadcast Saturday.
   He said his transfer ``is not related to the political
situation. It is necessary to open spaces for new generations.''
   The U.S.-backed government and leftist rebels are mired in an
eight-year civil war. Rebel and government negotiators have met
three times, most recently in October 1987, in an unsuccessful bid
to negotiate a cease-fire.
   On Sunday, two rebel commanders arrived in Panama City for talks
with Monsignor Arturo Rivera y Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of San Salvador, on the possible resumption of peace talks.
   Joaquin Villalobos and Leonel Gonzalez said they would meet on
Monday with Rivera y Damas and Monsignor Emile Stehle of West
Germany. Stehle has participated as an observer in previous
government-rebel talks.
   Blandon said the command change ``isn't going to bog us down or
slow us. Colonel Ponce is very qualified and capable.''
   Ponce commands the 3rd Infantry Brigade and belongs to the
``tandona,'' a tight-knit block of officers who have consolidated
control of the armed forces in recent months. The colonels, who
graduated together from the national military academy in 1966, hold
more than half the military's 36 command posts.
   Blandon will leave the nation with a legacy of a larger
military. He increased its size to 50,000 troops and accompanied
President Jose Napoleon Duarte in meetings with rebel leaders.
   At the request of U.S. military advisers, Blandon has increased
use of small strike forces against guerrillas rather than sweeping
offensives.
   More than 65,000 Salvadorans, mostly civilians, have been killed
in the civil war.

<TEXT>
   A police anti-gang task force arrested 365
people during the weekend and wounded a man who allegedly shot
another person during a party attended by gang members, authorities
said Sunday.
   Elder Marvin Hernandez, 22, struck by four of the 28 shots fired
by police, was in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center,
said hospital spokeswoman Norka Manning.
   Three officers responding to a shooting outside a party in the
Rampart District about 10:45 p.m. Saturday found Hernandez
allegedly shooting at a 17-year-old, said Detective Sid Nuckles.
   The teen-ager was treated for a minor wound, police said.
   It was not immediately known if Hernandez or the teen-ager were
gang members but police said gang members attended the party. When
Hernandez ignored orders to stop shooting, police opened fire,
striking him in both hands, the abdomen and the right forearm,
Nuckles said.
   In another incident, two men in a car fired at least six shots
at a reputed gang member and a woman early Sunday, police said.
   The woman was taken to Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical
Center with a shotgun wound to the abdomen, said Officer Charles S.
Walton. Her condition was unavailable. The man suffered minor
injuries, Walton said.
   Of the 365 people arrested in the two-night sweep of the
south-central area, 193 were reputed gang members, said Officer
Richard Dugerian.
   ``This is definitely the most active gang area in the city,''
said Detective Vern King. ``Gang membership means social status
here to some, and those are the ones we want to weed out.''
   Officers impounded 36 vehicles and confiscated 10 guns, Dugerian
said.
   Sgt. Clay Farrell characterized the sweep as successful. He said
the task force action was not related to the Halloween weekend.
   ``These goblins don't need an excuse to do their mischief,'' he
said.

   Sixteen radical students hurled
homemade explosives and firebombs outside the home of former
President Chun Doo-hwan at dawn Monday, injuring three policemen,
police said.
   Police officials said the students, wielding metal pipes and
wooden sticks, clashed with police who intercepted them while they
approached Chun's residence in western Seoul.
   The officials said on condition of anonymity that the three
policemen were taken to a hospital for serious injuries from
fragments of the explosives.
   News reports said five students were injured, but the police
officials said they knew of no student injuries.
   The radicals threw four homemade explosives and 20 gasoline
bottle firebombs, but Chun's home was not damaged, the officials
said.
   They said 12 students were arrested and that they claimed they
belonged to a ``suicide squad'' formed to demand the arrest and
punishment of Chun and his wife for alleged corruption during his
seven-year rule. He left office in February.
   Anti-government students stepped up their demand for the arrest
of the Chuns by holding demonstrations last week while the
opposition-dominated National Assembly probed into the Chun
family's allegedly illegal amassing of money.

   Palestinians ambushed and firebombed a
passenger bus in the occupied West Bank on Sunday night, killing an
Israeli woman and her three children and injuring at least five
other Israelis, the army said.
   An army communique early Monday said several Palestinians were
arrested and soldiers were sweeping the area around Jericho, seven
miles east of Jerusalem. A curfew was imposed on the biblical town
of 6,000.
   Earlier, a Palestinian was killed and 21 others wounded in
clashes between Israeli soldiers and Arab demonstrators in the West
Bank and occupied Gaza Strip.
   The deaths raised the toll to 305 Palestinians and 10 Israelis
killed in the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. The
bus attack caused the largest Israeli loss of life in a single
incident since the violence began Dec. 8.
   The red-and-white bus was stopped by a barricade of stones on
Jericho's outskirts, Israel radio said. Palestinians then hurled
five firebombs at the bus, which was carrying about 20 people, most
civilians.
   The bus was traveling from Tiberius on the Sea of Galilee to
Jerusalem when it was halted about 8:15 p.m., the army said.
Witnesses said it was engulfed in fire before the woman and her
children, sitting in the rear, could be rescued.
   The army said the dead were from Tiberius. News reports said two
of the children were infants.
   The army said five others were wounded, but Israel radio and the
national news agency Itim said 11 Israelis were killed or wounded.
   The deaths, the worst shedding of Israeli blood since the
Palestinian uprising began 10 months ago, came two days before
Tuesday's Parliament elections.
   It could swing undecided votes to the right-wing Likud bloc of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who has advocated a tougher line on
dealing with the unrest.
   ``The murderous and criminal act is testimony to the trend
towards more extremism on the part of the aggressors whose one
desire is to kill and burn as many Jews as possible,'' Itim quoted
Shamir as saying.
   Itim quoted Foreign Minister and Labor Party leader Shimon
Peres, his election rival, as saying that such attacks unite the
nation into ``one family.''
   ``Neither terrorism nor violence will determine our path. We
will determine our path,'' he said. ``Deeds such as tonight's tear
at the heart and provide nothing in the way of hope or a solution.''
   Israel radio broadcast an interview with a soldier aboard the
bus it identified only as Sgt. Ron, 21.
   ``I heard the sounds of a woman. I approached her, and grabbed
her with one hand. I said, `Come out with me.' She absolutely
refused,'' said the soldier.
   ``She said, `But I have a baby, what about the baby.' After a
few seconds, I realized that if I remained one more second (I would
be killed). ... I escaped with the last bit of energy.''
   Itim said the soldier, who suffered a burn on his ear, also was
unable to rescue another infant.
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron rushed to the site, and
soldiers combed nearby fields and citrus groves. Helicopters took
the wounded to hospitals, where some were reported in serious
condition.
   Extra soldiers have been deployed throughout the territories for
fear the parliamentary elections would bring even more violence.
   Underground Palestinian leaders called a general strike Tuesday
to coincide with the elections, and they joined Moslem
fundamentalists urging another strike Wednesday.
   An army spokesman said a Palestinian teen-ager died when
soldiers fired plastic bullets on youths demonstrating in the West
Bank Christian village of Beit Sahur, the site of the fields where
the Bible says shepherds first learned of the birth of Jesus.
   Village residents said Iyad Bishara Abu Sada, 18, was shot in
the chest with a plastic bullet and died instantly. A second
Palestinian was reported shot in the right arm.
   Rioters set fires, and troops declared the village a closed
military area and ordered reporters out.
   Palestinians took to the streets of Bethlehem to protest the
death. Women marched and chanted ``PLO, PLO, Israel no,'' and
troops ordered rock blockades cleared from roads.
   In the Gaza Strip, 18 Palestinians ranging in age from 12 to 70
were shot by soldiers, hospital officials said. The army said it
had reports of six woundings in the Gaza Strip and was checking the
other reports.
   Two Palestinians aged 12 and 14 were wounded when Israeli troops
fired on stone-throwers in the village of Salem near Nablus, the
West Bank's largest city, Arab reporters said. They said the
12-year-old was shot in the head.
   Palestinians also said they found the body of a young Arab, shot
in the head, in a water barrel Sunday in the West Bank village of
Rujib. Soldiers opened fire there to put down rioting a day earlier
and wounded at least six Palestinians. The army said it was
investigating.
   Also Sunday, a military spokesman said Israeli troops in
southern Lebanon shot and killed a Lebanese man in the mistaken
belief he was a guerrilla.
   Israel radio said the dead man had been hunting foxes at night
with a companion when he was shot Friday in Majdal Zoun.
   The village lies about 10 miles north of the Israeli border in
the ``security zone'' Israel declared after it pulled most of its
invasion forces out of Lebanon in 1985.

   Alderman Timothy Evans, a protege of the late
Harold Washington, returned to the spot where the city's first
black mayor launched his campaign in 1982 to declare Sunday that he
would run for mayor.
   ``Harold Washington stood on this very spot and made an
announcement that would change Chicago forever,'' Evans said at a
hotel in his South Side neighborhood.
   ``He looked out and saw a Chicago still in the grip of a
powerful machine,'' Evans said of the mayor he served as floor
leader in the City Council from 1983 until his death last year.
``He set out to destroy (the Democratic machine) at long last to
bring reform to the city of Chicago.
   ``We are here today because together we ... still share the
vision that he shared with this city, a vision based on principle,
not on personality,'' Evans said.
   He is joining a crowded Democratic primary field that includes
Aldermen Edward Burke, Lawrence Bloom, Danny Davis, former Alderman
Aloysius Majerczyk, former parks chief Ed Kelly, and Eugene Sawyer,
the acting mayor.
   Burke, Bloom, Kelly and Majerczyk are white. Davis, Evans and
Sawyer are black. Sawyer and some others have been trying to
convince black candidates that only one black should run.
   Sawyer was picked by his City Council colleagues last December
to temporarily replace Washington, and voters in April will choose
a mayor who will serve the last two years of Washington's four-year
term.
   Primaries will be held in February.

   President Reagan vowed Sunday that America
will never forget the lessons of the Holocaust, pledging unswerving
support for Israel and to ``use force'' against any threat of
fascism.
   ``We must defend ourselves against the evil of
totalitarianism,'' Reagan said in a speech to members of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center at its annual awards banquet.
   ``We must remain strong and we must be willing to use force when
we are under threat. This is a lesson that binds us still closer to
the state of Israel, for the fact is, a strong Israel depends upon
a strong America,'' Reagan said.
   ``An America that loses faith in the idea of a strong defense is
an America that will lose faith in a nation at arms like Israel,''
Reagan said.
   Declaring that ``monsters'' were responsible for the Holocaust,
Reagan said ``the mind reels from the enormity of the crime _ it
begs to be set free from so terrible a fact, to wipe it from the
memory.
   ``But people like Simon Wiesenthal have made us understand that
we must not, we cannot, we will not,'' Reagan pledged.
   The organization was founded in 1977 and named after the famed
Nazi-hunter. It is dedicated to preserving the memory of the
Holocaust, through which millions of Jews died at the hands of
Adolf Hitler's Nazis.
   The group presented Reagan with its 1988 Humanitarian Award in
recognition of his commitment to Israel, his work in defense of
human rights, on behalf of Soviet Jewry and the signing of the arms
reduction treaty with the Soviet Union, the White House said.
   It also presented a separate and first-ever award to Nancy
Reagan for her anti-drug abuse work among the nation's youth.
   In his address, Reagan lauded Wiesenthal, who was celebrating
his 80th birthday at the event. Arrested by Nazi forces in 1941,
Wiesenthal escaped twice from concentration camps and was liberated
by American forces in 1945. He and his wife, Cyla, were the only
two of 91 family members to survive the Holocaust, the White House
said.
   ``But out of the ashes of the Holocaust there came a good thing,
a great thing, called the state of Israel. And like Simon
Wiesenthal, the animating principles of the state of Israel are
justice and law tempered with compassion _ yes, the very principles
of Judaism itself,'' Reagan said, adding, ``And we Americans, with
our Judeo-Christian heritage, have no better friends than the
people of Israel.''
   Reagan, contending that his administration has made the ties
that bind America and Israel ``warmer than they ever have been,''
also used the occasion to insert a political note.
   Contending that his administration has kept its pledge to make
sure Israel retained ``its qualitative edge in the Middle East,''
Reagan noted that ``this record of friendship and fealty moved the
Democratic mayor of New York City to say ... that our
administration was the best friend Israel has ever had in the White
House.''
   Reagan did not refer to Mayor Ed Koch by name.
   The president also put in a call for a negotiated settlement to
the Middle East's turmoil.
   ``That same strength and resolve _ coupled with diplomatic
vision and a commitment to political reconciliation _ are essential
if Israel is to help achieve a negotiated settlement among the
war-weary peoples of the Middle East,'' he said.
   Reagan and his wife, who spent the weekend at their 688-acre
Santa Barbara ranch, were remaining in Los Angeles on Monday.
   The president was scheduled to make some campaign commercials
and attend meetings dealing with his presidential library.
   On Tuesday, Reagan renews his cross-country political travels on
behalf of Vice President George Bush, making appearances in
Fullerton and San Bernardino in California, and Reno, Nev., and
flying on to Milwaukee later in the day.
   Before returning to Washington on Wednesday, the president also
planned to address a Bush rally at Baldwin-Wallace College in
Cleveland.

   A motorist Sunday found a state Highway
Patrol trooper shot to death in his patrol car, which was partly
submerged in a lake, authorities said.
   Trooper George Tillman Radford, 41, was shot once behind the
head, said Dinah Widder, a spokeswoman for Patrol Capt. John C.
Garrison in Florence.
   Radford stopped someone for a traffic violation about 10:45 p.m.
Saturday, and was killed sometime after that, officials said.
   His body was found at 8 a.m. Sunday, but his gun and summons
book were missing, said Garrison.
   ``He was a good, hardworking individual, dedicated to law
enforcement. This is a very tragic situation, because when you kill
a police officer, you're actually killing a part of society,''
Garrison said. ``It was a needless, senseless murder.''
   An autopsy was being conducted as part of a State Law
Enforcement Division investigation.

<HEAD>1932 Balanchine Ballet Reconstructed by Joffrey Ballet</HEAD>

   A remarkable reconstruction of a 1932 George
Balanchine ballet from 1932 has been done for and by the Joffrey
Ballet. It's as though pieces of a jigsaw puzzle carried to four
continents were hunted down and put back together.
   However, on seeing ``Cotillon'' (The Ball) Sunday night at the
City Center, the story of the reconstruction seemed more
interesting than the ballet.
   It's a narrative ballet that presents incidents but doesn't tell
a story, name any character or sustain one mood. Many of
Balanchine's movement motifs in it were not carried into his later
work.
   In the ballet, a young girl, Tina LeBlanc, is primping in the
ballroom. A young man, the quicksilver Edward Stierle, comes in.
They dance. Guests enter. Jerel Hilding, the master of ceremonies,
rushes in late. When he's on stage, flirting or dancing, he looks
simultaneously harried, dashing and goofy.
   Two men carry in a pole from which hangs a curtain. Glenn
Edgerton enters. Women's white-gloved hands appear above the
curtain. He's to choose a partner but a black-gloved hand _ Beatriz
Rodriguez as Fate _ grabs him. She twirls around him in interesting
variations. In a lesser choreographer, this would be just
posturing. Balanchine also adds an undercurrent of menace.
   Five groups of three women dance in a wheel. The young girl
tells fortunes by looking at gloved palms, sees an ominous one. The
dance ends with the young girl dancing and two circles, the men and
the women, going around her.
   Robert Joffrey, who died earlier this year, worked toward
reconstruction of ``Cotillon'' for 10 years. It was one of three
ballets that Balanchine created for the Ballets Russes when it was
reorganized in Monte Carlo in 1932. Except for the Hand of Fate pas
de deux, which Roman Jasinski had danced and later staged for the
Tulsa Ballet Theater, it hadn't been danced since the early 1940s.
   Drs. Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer went to Indianapolis,
Seattle, Los Angeles, Tulsa, Paris, Switzerland, England and Buenos
Aires to talk with people and look at scrapbooks about conducting
the Chabrier music, the steps, sequences, scenery, costumes, props,
entrances and exits, hair styles, lighting, etc.
   Two amateurs had filmed parts of the ballet, one in New York,
the other in Australia. So it was carefully pieced together. We're
glad to have another Balanchine ballet in existence and wish we
felt less ``so what'' about it.
   The company also danced ``The Dream'' and ``La Vivandiere Pas de
Six'' on Sunday.

   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis,
brimming with confidence in his surging candidacy, said Sunday he's
got Republican rival George Bush on the run, while a Bush ally
raised questions about the vice president's promise not to raise
taxes.
   Kicking off a day-long train tour through California's Central
Valley, Dukakis sounded more like a front-runner than an underdog.
   He predicted he would overtake Bush before the Nov. 8 election
and, after weeks of being hammered by Republicans for being a
liberal, he defiantly declared: ``Yes, I'm a liberal in the
tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and and Harry Truman and John
Kennedy.''
   Recent public opinion polls show Dukakis closing fast on Bush in
several key states including California, a must-win state where
Dukakis aides said an 11-point Bush lead a week ago has shrunk to a
virtual tie.

   Even as Michael Dukakis insists there is time
to score an upset in the Nov. 8 balloting, many Democrats already
are second-guessing his campaign strategy in anticipation of
another national election defeat.
   ``After the election this may be the campaign considered the
worst managed in this century,'' said Democratic Sen. Terry Sanford
of North Carolina.
   Like many people in his party, Sanford insisted he thought
Dukakis still had a chance to defeat Republican nominee George
Bush, but he didn't sound overly optimistic.
   ``I'd bet money on it,'' he said of the chances of a Dukakis
upset. ``But I wouldn't bet my law license on it.''

   The United States plans to withdraw its
first warship from the Persian Gulf this week, U.S. sources said
Sunday, in a move that reflects confidence in the Iran-Iraq truce.
   The sources said the vessel will leave barring a last-minute
change in plans. It would be the first warship withdrawn since Iran
and Iraq agreed to an Aug. 20 cease-fire in their eight-year war.
   The 3,600-ton missile frigate, the USS Rodney M. Davis, will be
officially detached from gulf duty on Tuesday, said the sources on
condition of anonymity. It will sail for its home port in Yokosuka,
Japan, they said.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Mike Stepp refused

   The Reagan administration is expected to relax
some diplomatic and trade restrictions against North Korea early
this week as part of a coordinated strategy with South Korea to
ease tensions on the peninsula, according to U.S. officials.
   Although modest, the moves are believed to be the most extensive
the United States has adopted toward North Korea since the Korean
armistice was signed 35 years ago. An official announcement could
come as erly as Monday.
   The officials said the U.S. trade embargo against North Korea,
one of the tightest in the world, will be relaxed, possibly to
remove the ban on the sale of U.S. medical supplies to North Korea.
There also may be an easing on currency exchanges with North
Koreans.

   Savings institution executives, enduring their
worst losses since the Depression, face critical decisions next
year that will determine the future shape of their industry.
   In the first six months of 1988, the nation's 3,048 S&Ls, lost
$7.5 billion. By year's end, losses will almost certainly surpass
the previous record of $7.8 billion, set in 1987.
   Amid the tide of red ink, 4,050 S&L executives and their spouses
gathered in the palm-ringed resort hotels along Waikiki Beach for
the 96th annual convention of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the industry's oldest and largest trade group.
   In the opening session Monday, executives will begin mapping
strategy for 1989, when Congress will consider whether taxpayers
must pay to bail out the S&L deposit insurance fund, which so far
has been industry-funded.

   Prince Charles took on the architectural
establishment in his own television documentary and gained a
powerful vote of confidence from ordinary citizens, newspapers, and
even some architects.
   A newspaper survey showed that more than 75 percent of Britons
agreed with the prince's views that many architects and developers
ignore people's wishes and build ugly, characterless buildings that
are unpleasant to live in.
   However, Bill Rodgers, director general of The Royal Institute
of British Architects, responded Sunday that ``there is too much
hypocrisy ... and we are not going to allow architects to be made
scapegoats.''
   Charles' maiden venture into television writing and performing
was an outspoken and often humorous look at modern architecture,
which he has ridiculed for years. He has angered leading architects
and raised complaints that a member of the royal family has no
business publicizing such views.

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After losing ground to its neighbors,
Louisville is finally shaking off the lingering effects of the last
recession with the help of public and private investment.
   A recent survey of Louisville and 14 comparison cities shows
that, for the first half of this year, the Louisville area has
generated more high-paying jobs than other regional competitors.
   The list includes Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Nashville, Tenn.,
Richmond, Va., and Kansas City, Mo.
   ``Coming out of the recession, Louisville's growth was quite
small relative to the other cities,'' said Paul Cooms, an economist
with the Bureau of Economic Research at the University of
Louisville, which conducted the survey.
   Indianapolis, for example, enjoyed a rapid renaissance as new
hotels, skyscrapers and athletic facilities, such as the Hoosier
Dome, gave the city a new vigor.
   Louisville, on the other hand, had a tough time overcoming the
closed factories and lost jobs following the recessions.
   ``But in the last two to three years, Louisville has finally
recovered strongly,'' Cooms said. ``Louisville is a good market,
and people know it.''
   ``I don't know how much you want to make out of two quarters of
data, but certainly we've recovered well,'' Cooms said.
   Civic leaders agree. The most recent tangible evidence that the
city is on the move, they say, was Saturday's dedication of the new
national headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).
   Louisville won the headquarters at the church's 1987 assembly in
Biloxi, Miss., by scoring a convention-floor upset over Kansas
City, which had been recommended by the church's site selection
committee.
   Louisville had been ruled out as a site until a local
businessman offered to donate two turn-of-the-century warehouses
worth $1 million on the city's waterfront. Community pledges of $7
million more were made to renovate the buildings, and the city
offered a parking garage and rebuilt streets.
   In addition, major banks offered a $25 million revolving loan
fund at favorable rates.
   Mayor Jerry Abramson said persuading the Presbyterians to come
to Louisville showed ``people in this community that when we work
together in a cooperative way we can compete with anybody at any
level.''
   That is the idea behind the Campaign for Greater Louisville _ a
largely business-backed organization that has raised more than $10
million, and plans to strengthen and expand existing businesses, to
create new local businesses and to attract outside business to the
area.
   The campaign's first expenditure two months ago went toward the
proposed $300 million expansion of Louisville's Standiford Field.
Two new, parallel runways are to be built, displacing thousands of
residents, as well as businesses and churches.
   ``I can't think of a more important economic-development step
this campaign can take at this point in time,'' campaign chairman
George N. Gill, president and publisher of the Louisville
Courier-Journal, said then.
   Abramson, who is also pushing the airport expansion, believes
another key to continued downtown development _ despite stiff
competition from the suburbs and a stagnant population _ rests with
providing incentives to counter a loss of federal aid.
   Local government, with the help of federal dollars, invested
heavily in downtown from 1970 to the early 1980s. Now that federal
support has dropped off, local government is concentrating on
projects that support economic development and make downtown more
attractive.
   And civic leaders have returned to the city's oldest and
greatest asset _ the Ohio River _ as the major source of downtown
revitalization.
   ``Administrations before me studied it and studied it. What we
decided to do was take some risks and start to develop the
waterfront,'' Abramson said.
   Now, hundreds of millions of dollars in new and planned
construction are taking place within blocks of the river's edge.
   But Cooms said Louisville's continued growth is conditional upon
the U.S. economy's continuing to expand and favorable exchange and
interest rates.
   ``The average life of an economic recovery is only about four
years, and we're now finishing the sixth year, so it should make
some people nervous,'' Cooms said.
   One national survey said the population of the metropolitan area
has declined from about 970,000 on Jan. 1, 1987, to about 966,000
on Jan. 1 of this year causing the area to slip from 48th to 50th
place as a national market.
   That may not bode well for the city's ability to attract large
companies and national advertising dollars, particularly if the
slide continues because many decisions are made on the basis of a
metropolitan area's ranking in the nation's top 50 markets.

   The half-dozen high rollers who boarded the
corporate jet and headed West for the glittering city with fast
action weren't gamblers. They were shoppers.
   The junket didn't go to Las Vegas but to Seattle for a shopping
spree at Nordstrom, an upscale clothing chain with a reputation for
customer service.
   The flying shoppers breakfasted on fresh strawberries and orange
juice and dabbed their wrists with samples of perfume as the small
jet skimmed high over the Cascade Mountains.
   Nordstrom may have outdone itself with the all-expenses-paid jet
flight for some of its best Yakima customers.
   ``What it did for me was reinforce the idea that I am shopping
in the right place,'' said Charlene Franklund, one of the customers
who made the Oct. 12 trip.
   ``I suggested they go to San Francisco next time,'' she added.
``I can go to Seattle anytime.''
   But rarely in such high-flying comfort _ aboard a sleek
12-seater with a cabin attendant, plus taxi service from Boeing
Field to downtown and a personal salesperson for the entire day.
   The shopping adventure included lunch beside Elliott Bay and
gourmet cookies for the flight home.
   ``They really did treat us very nicely,'' Ms. Franklund said
with a sigh.
   Seattle-based Nordstrom Inc. has made a splash in recent years
with trendy stores and classy service that includes a hassle-free
return policy. The company has 42 department stores, most of them
on the West Coast, although it also operates in Utah, Virginia and
is opening a store in New Jersey next spring.
   Most recently, Nordstrom made news by opening a $67 million,
336,000-square-foot store in San Francisco.
   In the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, Nordstrom had sales of
$1.92 billion and profits of $92.7 million.
   While Yakima has a 44,000-square foot Nordstrom store of its
own, the selection can't compete with some of the huge Seattle
stores.
   Some customers suggested the trip, and Yakima manager Juliana
Dennis arranged for the 140-mile flight to the big city.
   ``They are customers that do come in frequently and spend a lot
of money with us,'' Ms. Dennis said.
   She declined to say how much the shoppers spent but, despite the
costs of the corporate jet, the elegant lunch and transportation in
Seattle, ``it was worth the effort,'' she said.
   ``It benefited everyone,'' she said. ``Not only the customer but
us as well.''
   Originally a one-time trip, the company is now considering
additional trips from Yakima because of customer demand, she said.
   The National Retail Merchants Association, in New York City,
noted that some major department stores have programs to reward
frequent shoppers.
   ``Some stores do bus people around,'' said spokesman John Gary,
who added that Dallas-based Neiman Marcus is the only other
department store they had heard of that flies customers to stores.
   ``It's done ad hoc from time to time,'' confirmed Jan Roberts, a
spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus.
   It is fairly common for Nordstrom stores to organize bus trips
for people from outlying areas.
   She said there were no spending minimums for those who went on
the Seattle trip, and no invitations were issued. Customers only
had to ask to be included, she said.
   The customers were accompanied by salespeople from the Yakima
store, and the rack-full of clothing they selected was brought back
on the plane to be rung up in Yakima, Ms. Dennis said.
   While royalty and movie stars may be used to jetliner shopping
sprees, the average department store customer is not. Because of
that, the company had hoped to keep the Yakima trips a secret, said
corporate spokeswoman Kellie Tormey.
   ``We can't make it (trips) available to everyone,'' she said in
a telephone interview from Seattle. ``This was a specific situation
where the request came from the customers to do this thing.
   ``We're not going to be able to do it in every region,'' Ms.
Tormey said, in declining to provide additional information.
   For Ms. Franklund, the flight was just a more convenient way to
make a shopping trip she frequently makes anyway.
   ``I didn't spend any money I wouldn't have otherwise spent,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government-owned
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has signed an accord
with the United Arab Emirates for protecting overseas investments
from political risks, officials said Sunday.
   The accord, approved after six years of negotiations, will allow
OPIC to compensate American investors for losses caused by
political crises, the officials said.
   The U.A.E., a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, was the
fifth of the GCC members to sign the accord after Saudi Arabia,
Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. Kuwait, the sixth GCC member, also was
expected to sign a similar agreement.
   The accord was negotiated by Robert C. O'Sullivan, assistant
general counsel for claims at OPIC, and Donald A. Roberts, the
first secretary for economics at the American embassy in Abu Dhabi.
   ``Such an agreement will break the psychological barrier
preventing American investors from operating in the U.A.E.,''
O'Sullivan told The Associated Press. ``This is a proof of the
friendly relations between the U.S. and the U.A.E.''
   Since 1971, OPIC has served as the key U.S. agency for
encouraging American business investment in developing countries
through providing American investors with insurance against certain
political risks, loan guarantees, direct loans to small business
and cooperatives and a variety of pre-investment programs.
   ``All these are designed to reduce the perceived stumbling risks
and blocks associated with overseas investment,'' O'Sullivan said.
   In the past 17 years, OPIC has settled about 215 insurance
claims totalling $465 million. Its premiums are based on the nature
of the investors' undertaking and the risk profile of the project,
not on the country where the investment is launched, he said.

   In a decision dismaying to power companies
throughout the country, the government has told a Wisconsin utility
that planned repairs to a coal-burning power plant will subject it
to strict air pollution standards for new plants.
   Utilities are worried because they fear the decision, the first
of its kind, could apply to hundreds of plants. If so, utilities
say they might have to close old plants, forgo needed repairs or
incur huge expenses to meet the standards.
   The Energy Department says the decision could jeopardize future
power supplies, but environmentalists say the federal government
should have enforced the standards years ago to improve air quality.
   The Environmental Protection Agency's decision marks the first
time the federal government has intervened in renovations at a coal
plant. In the past, EPA has not become involved because state
authorities administering the federal Clean Air Act have never
brought such projects to the agency's attention. Wisconsin is the
first to do so.
   EPA said the Wisconsin Electric Power Co.'s Port Washington
plant near Milwaukee should be covered by new plant air standards
because renovation work will result in an increase in current
emissions of several pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, a major
cause of acid rain.
   EPA administrator Lee M. Thomas said the agency is working on a
policy to cover past renovations at coal plants since the Clear Air
Act was written in 1971. ``The agency is considering what steps may
be necessary'' to address previous projects, he said in a letter to
the company.
   ``This will be setting a precedent for the entire country,''
said Bob Beck, environmental manager for the Edison Electric
Institute, trade association for the nation's private utilities.
   Wisconsin Electric, which had planned to spend about $71 million
to replace cracked steam drums, says the work is routine
maintenance and should not trigger tougher air standards for new
plants.
   Under EPA's pollution guidelines, it could cost the company $800
million to fix the plant, industry analysts say.
   Edwin R. Anthony, spokesman for the trade group, said the nation
has 821 coal-fired generating units of which 360 are smaller than
200 mega-watts. ``My guess is that most of these (smaller) plants
are over 35 years old,'' he said.
   Utilities are increasingly relying on ``life extension''
projects to keep old plants running. Plants with a tax life of 30
years can be used for 60 years with careful renovation.
   The Energy Department says as much as 25 percent of the nation's
fossil fuel capacity is produced at plants that are older than 30
years. That number will jump to 90 percent in in 2010.
   Port Washington has five 80-mega-watt units between the ages of
38 and 53 years. The company would like to keep the plant running
until 2010 instead of retiring the last unit in 1999.
   ``Obviously, it could throw a monkey wrench into our plans,''
said Wisconsin Electric spokeswoman Lisa Fox in Milwaukee. ``We
need the capacity.''
   J. Allen Wampler, assistant secretary of energy for fossil
energy, wrote EPA its decision ``could result in aggravating an
expected shortfall in electric generating capacity in the 1990s or,
at best, in the construction of less economical methods of
generating electricity.''
   The most important air standard covers sulfur dioxide emissions,
a principal raw material for acid rain. Port Washington now burns
coal emitting 2.5 pounds of sulfur for every million BTUs provided.
   A new plant is limited to between 0.6 and 1.2 pounds and must
remove 70 percent to 90 percent of the sulfur in the coal.
   As a practical matter, the only way for an old plant to comply
with the standards is to install smokestack ``scrubbers,'' which
industry analysts say could cost about $800 million at Port
Washington.
   Wisconsin Electric Power Co. and the EPA are discussing whether
plans for the repairs can be changed to avoid making the new-plant
standards apply.
   Negotiators for EPA and Wisconsin Electric might be able to come
up with a solution that would reduce air pollution while holding
down costs. Ms. Fox declined to discuss specifics of the talks, but
she confirmed that switching from coal to oil or gas is an option.
   David Hawkins, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental group, said any agreement that did not
adhere to the air standards exactly might be vulnerable to legal
challenge.
   Though utility sulfur dioxide emissions have been falling since
the mid-1970s, environmentalists say they would have been reduced
by more if utilities had replaced plants faster rather than
extending their usage.
   Life extension ``wasn't even on the radar screen'' in 1979, when
the current regulations were promulgated, said Hawkins, then the
assistant EPA administrator in charge of drafting them.
   Hawkins said EPA ``is making the right call.'' He added, ``It's
about time they put some life and teeth into the requirements''
that some renovation qualifies a plant as new.

<HEAD>Dun & Bradstreet Selling Airline Guides To British Publisher
Maxwell</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Monday PMs.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Dun & Bradstreet Corp. says it has agreed to
sell its airline guides publishing business for $750 million cash
to a company formed by British publisher Robert Maxwell, and has
given Maxwell an option to purchase its travel agency business.
   The business publishing and market research company, which had
announced in July that it was seeking a buyer for its Official
Airline Guides and Thomas Cook Travel USA units, said Sunday it
should realize a $450 million after-tax gain from the deal.
   Maxwell and Dun & Bradstreet stated in a news release that they
expected to complete the deal by the end of this year.
   The Official Airline Guides business includes transportation and
travel guides, travel magazines such as Frequent Flier, which has a
circulation of about 350,000, and an on-line ticketing,
reservation, schedule and fare information service.
   ``OAG is the world's leading information and related services
provider to the travel industry,'' stated Maxwell, who already
publishes the in-flight magazine for British Airways. ``OAG is the
predominant provider of printed airline products in North America,
with significant presence in other areas of the world.''
   The Thomas Cook Travel division of the business is one of the
nation's biggest travel agencies, with annual sales of $365
million, Dun & Bradstreet stated.
   Including Thomas Cook, Officials Airline Guides had operating
income of about $65 million on revenue of about $180 million last
year.
   Dun & Bradstreet, which also owns the Nielsen marketing and
television research companies, Moody's Investors Service credit
rating firm and Donnelley marketing and directory publishing
businesses, has been acquiring and selling businesses in order to
focus more on its key markets for information services.
   Dun & Bradstreet agreed to acquire IMS International Inc., a
major market research concern, last February in a stock swap valued
at $1.77 billion.
   The company also has announced plans to acquire Commercial
Credit Co.'s American Credit Indemnity Co. business credit
insurance subsidiary for $140 million, and Chase Manhattan Corp.'s
Interactive Data Corp., a securities research firm for $140 million.
   Dun & Bradstreet posted a profit of $375.9 million, or $2.01 per
share, on revenue of $3.13 billion during the nine months ended
Sept. 30.
   Maxwell is engaged in a battle against corporate buyout
powerhouse Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. over publishing giant
Macmillan Inc., which has agreed to a $2.5 billion buyout by
Kohlberg. Maxwell, who has a rival $2.6 billion offer for Macmillan
outstanding, is challenging the Kohlberg deal in a Delaware court.
   Maxwell's international publishing empire includes trade
magazines for U.S. agribusiness, scientific journals and British
tabloid newspapers.
