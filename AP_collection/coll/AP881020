<HEAD>Concern Expressed Over Idaho Closing Border To Radioactive
Shipments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Idaho governor's decision to close his
state to shipments of radioactive waste will mean that the Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant northwest of Denver must find somewhere
else to ship its wastes.
   Colorado officials and citizens groups that monitor Rocky Flats,
which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons,
expressed concern over the implications of Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus'
decision Wednesday.
   The U.S. Department of Energy on Thursday said it would honor
Andrus' decision and curtail shipments to Idaho from Rocky Flats,
which has sent virtually all its waste to Idaho for the last 20
years.
   ``This is a nightmare come true,'' said Jan Pilcher, spokeswoman
for Citizens Against Rocky Flats Contamination. ``It's absolutely
unacceptable to store transuranic waste near a major metropolitan
area.''
   Rocky Flats does not have a state permit that would allow
long-term storage of wastes on site, officials said.
   Rockwell International Inc., which operates Rocky Flats for the
Department of Energy, had planned to begin shipping plant wastes to
a permanent disposal site in New Mexico this month.
   Problems in obtaining permits have forced the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, or WIPP, near Carlsbad, N.M., to postpone its opening
until next year.
   Rockwell spokesman Pat Etchart said the DOE is ``assessing the
impact'' of Andrus' decision and examining all possible storage
options.
   Tim Holeman, an environmental advisor to Gov. Roy Romer, said
state officials will meet next week with DOE and Rocky Flats
officials to discuss how wastes will be handled at the facility.
   ``We don't want any longer storage at Rocky Flats,'' Holeman
said. ``We want WIPP to open as soon as possible.''
   He said health and radiation experts will be asked to assess the
possible added risk of long-term storage of wastes at Rocky Flats.
   Andrus, in a sharply worded letter to Energy Secretary John
Herrington, said long delays in opening WIPP have left 2.4 million
cubic feet of contaminated material at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls.
   Idaho was supposed to begin shipping 20 years of accumulated
waste from Rocky Flats and other plants to the New Mexico site this
month. But Congress failed to transfer the 10,240-acre site from
the public domain to DOE.
   Several unresolved safety concerns have delayed the opening as
well, and when Andrus visited the New Mexico site this week, DOE
officials told him they did not know when the facility would open.
   ``This answer is simply unacceptable,'' Andrus said in his
letter to Herrington.

<HEAD>900-Year Terms Recommended For Two Convicted In Camarena Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prison terms of 900 years each were
recommended Wednesday for two men convicted in connection with the
torture slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, who died
working undercover in Mexico.
   Federal prosecutors also recommended in a sentencing memorandum
filed Wednesday that one of the defendants, Raul Lopez Alvarez, be
given an additional 10 years and that both men be ineligible for
parole for 60 years.
   The recommendation for Jesus Felix Gutierrez, a third man
convicted in the case, is 10 years.
   Lopez, 29, a former Mexican homicide detective stationed in
Guadalajara, was convicted in September of the 1985 murders of the
Drug Enforcement Administration agent and pilot Alfredo Zavala
Avelar.
   Lopez also was found guilty of conspiracy to kidnap, kidnapping,
accessory after the fact and two counts of committing violent acts
in support of racketeering, a new statute aimed at drug-related
crimes.
   Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, an admitted drug trafficker also was
convicted last month of five counts of conspiracy, kidnapping,
murder and two counts of violent acts in support of racketeering.
   Sentencing for Lopez is scheduled for Monday and Verdugo's is
scheduled for Wednesday.
   Felix, 39, is serving 15 years in jail for a drug trafficking
conviction. He was found guilty of being an accessory after the
fact by helping the alleged mastermind of the scheme, Rafael Caro
Quintero, escape to Costa Rica following the murders.
   Caro Quintero is in custody in Mexico, serving a sentence for
weapons violations. He has been tried in the Camarena slaying, but
authorities there have not yet reached a verdict. Sentencing for
Felix also was scheduled Wednesday.

   Members of a labor union burned an
American flag and shouted slogans on Wednesday to protest a new
agreement on U.S. military bases.
   President Corazon Aquino dismissed criticism of the accord,
signed Monday in Washington by Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus and
U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, and the largest political
party in the Philippines' Congress pledged to support it.
   About 150 members of the leftist May First Movement labor
alliance burned an American flag near the U.S. Embassy, shouting
slogans assailing U.S. foreign policy as they carried banners
against the bases. Riot police prevented them from marching to the
embassy grounds and they dispersed peacefully.
   The agreement allows the United States to maintain six bases
here until 1991 in return for $962 million in aid over the final
two years of the pact.
   But critics charged that the government settled for too little
compensation. Filipino negotiators had demanded $1.2 billion
annually.
   ``I knew that it would not get total acceptance,'' Mrs. Aquino
said of the agreement. ``But I still believe Secretary Manglapus
did a very commendable job and that certainly, it is a big
improvement from the previous bases agreement.''
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said the agreement showed that
Mrs. Aquino had secretly decided to work for extending the bases
even after their lease expires in September 1991.
   ``The terms contained in the just-concluded agreement strongly
indicate to us that the Aquino regime will continue to foist upon
our people this onerous burden of a military presence on Philippine
soil,'' he said.
   The United States had been paying $180 million a year for use of
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations.
   The pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino, which claims
151 out of 225 legislators as members, said Wednesday that the
agreement provided nearly three times as much aid as the United
States granted to deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``Our party is satisfied with the agreement and will support it,
although we realize that more hard work is needed to resolve other
issues related to the American base facilities in our country,''
the legislators said.
   The Senate created a special committee Wednesday to determine if
the new bases pact violates the Philippine Constitution and if the
accord, actually an amendment to a 47-year-old agreement, is
subject to Senate approval as some senators claim. Mrs. Aquino said
it is not.
   Any extension beyond 1991 must be approved by two-thirds of the
Senate, where sentiment against the bases is strong.
   The Senate's main objection to the accord is a provision that
allows the United States to maintain its policy of neither
confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on aircraft
and ships visiting the bases.
   The Constitution mandates that the Philippines adopt a policy of
freedom from nuclear weapons ``consistent with the national
interest,'' but legal experts say the phrase falls short of an
outright ban.
   Communist guerrillas, whose demand for the removal of the bases
has fanned a 20-year-old rebellion, accused the goverment of
``shamelessly selling out'' Philippine sovereignty.

   A federal court jury Wednesday convicted
four people of conspiracy to import cocaine in a scheme involving
the use of military mail to ship the drug from Panama to the United
States.
   The jury, which deliberated about five hours Wednesday, convicted
   Oscar and Regina Smith and Julia Thom, all of New York City, and
Gary King of Doerun, Ga., were convicted after about five hours of
jury deliberations. All four face up to life in prison and $4
million in fines.
   U.S. District Judge J. Robert Elliott set no sentencing date.
   Prosecutors said the four were involved in a drug ring that
shipped 352 pounds of cocaine to the United States between early
1987 and May of this year.
   ``Obviously, we're pleased,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Deborah Fowler after the verdict was read. ``We believe the jury
spoke.''
   The alleged conspiracy was discovered when Jackie Lee Bigelow of
Moultrie was arrested in Colquitt County for a traffic violation
and police discovered 17 pounds of cocaine in the trunk of his
girlfriend's car.
   Bigelow, a former soldier, pleaded guilty and testified for the
prosecution. Authorities claim 42 pounds of cocaine were mailed to
some of Bigelow's friends from military post offices in Panama.
   Frank Martin, who represented Oscar Smith, said the sheer volume
of the drug, which was shown to jurors, probably helped sway their
decision.
   ``It was just too much cocaine to overcome,'' Martin said. ``I
think it was such a shocking amount that the jury couldn't focus on
other issues.''
   Prosecutors told the jury that duffel bags stuffed with cocaine
also were flown to air bases in Georgia, Texas and Maryland from
Howard Air Force Base in Panama.
   The couriers were either current or former soldiers who used
false military ID cards, wore their old uniforms and carried forged
leave papers to board military flights, prosecutors said.
   The defendants were charged with a variety of criminal counts,
including conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.
   Smith, the alleged mastermind, was convicted on 19 of 20 counts,
including conspiracy to import cocaine, use of the mail to
facilitate a drug felony and possession with intent to distribute.
   Mrs. Smith, his wife, was convicted of four counts, including
use of a telephone to facilitate a drug felony.
   King was convicted of three counts, including possession with
intent to distribute and interstate transportation in aid of
racketeering.
   Mrs. Thom, who was arrested with Mrs. Smith at a Moultrie motel
last May, was convicted on one count of conspiracy to possess
cocaine with intent to distribute.
   Mrs. Smith told officers who arrested her that she made the trip
to Moultrie because she was having an affair with Bigelow. Mrs.
Thom said she thought she was traveling to Georgia to pick up Mrs.
Smith's niece for a return trip to New York.
   Bigelow and John Turner, a military reservist from Nashville,
Tenn., have pleaded guilty to one count each, but three major
figures in the case remain free because the government has not been
able to bring them out of Panama.
   Ms. Fowler identified them last week as Faustino Lee, an alleged
paymaster at the New York end of the cocaine connection, and Alex
Smith and Ricardo Brown, described as key figures in the ring.

   A woman sentenced to 30 days in jail for tax
evasion will be freed for two hours each day so she can go home to
her cats and visit a park to feed squirrels and birds.
   Daisy Salsman, 50, began serving her sentence Tuesday at the
Cass County Jail here. She was convicted in May of tax evasion,
conspiracy and failure to file income tax returns.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy granted her request to be
released from jail so she could feed her four cats and the
squirrels and birds at a park near her home.
   Mrs. Salsman said in a letter to Conmy last week that she had
tried to find someone to care for her animals but had been
unsuccessful.
   ``While this sounds like a ridiculous request, the court finds
that it does have merit,'' Conmy wrote in an order signed Friday.

<HEAD>Egypt Slows Down When Falcon Crest Is On TV</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life comes to a near standstill Monday
nights as millions of Egyptians sit riveted before their television
sets to watch Angela Channing's melodramatic malevolence on
``Falcon Crest.''
   However, Jane Wyman's character and the others in the series
have few counterparts in Egyptian society. Even the setting, a
winery in a Napa Valley-like area of California, might have
alienated many Egyptian Moslems taught by Islam's holy book, the
Koran, to abstain from alcohol.
   Yet the show is a fabulous hit.
   Egypt has nothing similar to the Nielson ratings to gauge
exactly how popular it is, but Sohair el-Etriby, head of Egyptian
Television's second channel, which airs the series, has no doubts.
   ``Egyptians have become addicted to `Falcon Crest,''' she said.
``They've become very attached to it.''
   Whether rich and educated or poor peasants reading Arabic
subtitles on the screen, ``Falcon Crest'' fanatics consider the
characters a part of their extended families. Their fortunes and
disasters are eagerly followed and discussed everywhere.
   The American series also has proved lucrative for state-owned
Egyptian Television. Channel Two buys an episode for around $1,000,
and on a recent Monday sales of commercials brought in almost 20
times that.
   Angela Channing, the scheming matriarch of the Falcon Crest
brood; ruthless but charming Richard Channing; and dedicated and
romantic, if somewhat naive, Maggie are among the main characters
in the colorful series that depicts love, hate and events both foul
and fair.
   Early episodes of ``Falcon Crest'' began appearing on Egyptian
screens several years ago. Because of finances, Egyptian Television
bought only a few 26-episode seasons at a time, showing them daily
and then stopping for months until money was found for succeeding
episodes.
   Despite the gaps in transmission, ``Falcon Crest'' fans remained
true, and for two consecutive months last summer, the fifth and
sixth seasons were aired every night from 9:15 p.m. to 10 p.m.
   The show was so popular that all over Cairo appointments were
made before or after ``Falcon Crest.'' TV parties with friends were
common, and Cairo's congested streets emptied as each episode was
shown.
   At the end of August, el-Etreby changed the schedule, showing
two episodes every Monday night. She said her office immediately
was swamped with hundreds of calls and letters demanding that the
series be shown daily again.
   ``I had only a few episodes from the seventh part, and the
eighth is now running in the United States,'' she said in an
interview. ``Either I could have stopped it for several months and
then shown the seventh part in its entirety, or I could have shown
it once a week like television in America and Europe do all the
time.''
   ``Falcon Crest'' isn't the first American TV series to make a
big splash with Egyptian viewers. In the 1960s and '70s, ``Peyton
Place'' and ``Rich Man, Poor Man'' were favorites.
   In 1982, Egyptian Television began showing ``Dallas,'' which
quickly became almost as popular as ``Falcon Crest'' would become
later. ``Dallas'' was stopped, however, after a member of
parliament complained that it was corrupting the morals of Egyptian
youth.
   The morality of ``Falcon Crest'' would not seem to be much
different, with Angela's scheming against her own son, and the
characters' frequent exchanges of bed partners.
   But the serial has escaped unscathed so far, except for Egyptian
Television's routine censorship which unskillfully scissors about
five minutes of what the censors consider passionate lovemaking
from each 50-minute episode.
   So ``Falcon Crest,'' giving Egyptians a glimpse of a completely
different and glittering world, easily captures its audience.
   Viewers have different reasons for appreciating the series.
   ``I like watching it because the men and women are so beautiful,
wearing lovely clothes and living in beautiful houses,'' said
Fawziya Ahmed, a peasant from a small village north of Cairo in the
Nile Delta.
   Christiane Latif, who helps run a family-owned marble factory,
said: ``The characters are interesting and become like your family,
and the plot makes you want to know what will happen next. I try
not to miss any of the shows.''
   Such sentiments aren't universal, however.
   One government official, who declined to be identified, said he
finds nothing special about Falcon Crest. He complained that his
wife and 5-year-old daughter cannot be distracted from the screen
when the show was on.
   And some Americans worry that Egyptians might think all
Americans are the glittery Hollywood types of ``Falcon Crest.''

   Sidney Rittenberg came to China as a young
idealist and his reward was 16 years in prison. Now he helps other
foreigners find keys to the doors of commerce in his adopted land.
   Rittenberg, 67, is president of Kamsky and Rittenberg, a
consulting firm that helps freign clients, most of their American,
get information and access to Chinese officials.
   Since establishing the firm a year ago, Rittenberg has found
markets and Chinese partners for U.S. makers of gas turbines,
pencils, jeans and electrical appliances, and guided them through
the enigmatic world of Chinese contract negotiations.
   He has organized tours for such as evangelist Billy Graham and
Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi, sometimes acting as interpreter in
impeccable Mandarin at meetings with senior Chinese leaders.
   ``I like the feeling that we're building little bridges,'' he
said in an interview.
   Rittenberg began building his bridges decades ago, with some
disastrous consequences. He is a native of Charleston, S.C., and
first came to China in 1945, as a U.S. Army interpreter after
studying Chinese at Stanford.
   Like other young American liberals caught up in the turbulence,
Rittenberg was attracted by the zeal and idealism of Mao Tse-tung's
revolutionaries.
   ``I was taken with the idea they were going to build a new kind
of just, democratic socialist society,'' he said. After leaving the
Army he decided to stay in China, at the urging of Chou En-lai and
other leaders, to help establish an English-language radio service.
   When Chinese authorities put him in the back of a truck going to
Beijing in 1949, he thought he was being enlisted to help negotiate
relations between the United States and Mao's new Communist
government. ``I was euphoric,'' he said.
   Instead, Rittenberg was imprisoned on charges of being an
American spy.
   He learned later that Soviet dictator Josef Stalin demanded his
arrest, claiming Rittenberg was an accomplice of American
journalist Anna Louise Strong, who had been arrested in Moscow for
spying. She and Rittenberg were collaborating on a biography of Mao.
   Six years in prison followed, the first of them in an unlighted
room with black cloth over the windows.
   When he was released and cleared of wrongdoing in 1955, ``Mao
apologized to me,'' he said. ``They really felt bad about it and
took me into the family.''
   Back at Radio Beijing, he was made privy to material seldom
revealed to outsiders. ``That was power, access to inside
information,'' he said in the interview.
   His world collapsed once more during the Cultural Revolution of
1966-76.
   Again he was deceived. He said he thought the Cultural
Revolution, with which Mao dislodged the entrenched bureaucracy,
``was a great day, a kind of town hall democracy.''
   But the radical leftists who gained power revived the old spying
charges and jailed him in 1968. He spent 10 years in solitary and
his Chinese wife, Yulin, was sentenced to three years in a labor
camp.
   ``There was only one real issue, keeping your sanity from day to
day,'' he said of the lost decade. ``I tried not to be bitter. In
solitary, bitterness is the enemy. But who are you going to be sore
at? It was the whole system.''
   He said he felt freedom was near when he heard Mao's widow,
Jiang Qing, yelling from a nearby cell. Jiang, who Rittenberg says
personally prolonged his prison term, was arrested in late 1976 as
ringleader of the notorious ``Gang of Four.''
   Again released and again exonerated, he was given a sinecure
with the Academy of Social Sciences, helping arrange academic
exchanges. In 1979 he returned to the United States for the first
time in 34 years.
   Rittenberg now spends about half the year in the United States.
His consulting firm has an office in New York and he has a home in
Seattle, where one of his four children also lives.
   His hope that Chinese communism would be ``different from the
Russians, more civilized and democratic,'' dissolved long ago.
   ``Mao went back on his promises,'' he said, and if the
democratic socialism he once envisioned for China ever comes, ``it
will be nothing resembling Marxist-Leninist societies so far.''
   After so many years away, Rittenberg said, he finds the United
States to be a more humane country.
   ``The leaders of the Chinese revolution didn't understand that
if not everyone is protected by law then no one is,'' he said.
``Our forefathers were smart enough to build that into the system.''
   Rittenberg worries about corruption in China, where young people
``have no 10 Commandments and no Communist ideology'' and party
officials are among the greediest. He said there are ``thieves
galore built into the system,'' but believes a ``kind of
self-correcting mechanism'' will see China through.
   China and the United States ``have a special chemistry and
there's no reason it shouldn't cement and grow,'' Rittenberg said.
``I feel kind of good it is happening now.''

   A compromise anti-drug bill began to take
shape Wednesday night as more than 20 House-Senate negotiators
agreed to major law enforcement provisions.
   The lawmakers, however, were unable to agree on how to carry out
provisions to deny many federal benefits to those convicted of drug
offenses.
   While there was no doubt that denial of benefits would remain in
the bill, disagreement remained over whether judges should have
discretion in removing the benefits _ or should be required to
withdraw the assistance upon conviction.
   The drug bill, expected to authorize about $2.5 billion in new
spending, is the major legislation keeping Congress in session. The
top House and Senate leadership was expected to resolve the
remaining issues Thursday and, hopefully, schedule final passage on
Friday.
   Each house has overwhelmingly approved different versions of the
popular election-year legislation, which also will include the
death penalty for those who kill during drug crimes.
   One of the most controversial House-approved measures was
dropped. It would have permitted introduction in federal court of
evidence seized illegally, but in ``good faith'' _ even when a
search was made without a warrant. Current law permits the ``good
faith'' exception only when searches are conducted with warrants.
   The negotiators accepted Senate language on child pornography.
The provisions would set prison terms of 20 years-to-life for
anyone convicted of facilitating use of a child for producing
sexually explicit materials.
   The buying and selling of children for the purpose of producing
child pornography would be made a federal crime.
   The negotiators failed to agree on Senate provisions to
strengthen adult anti-obscenity laws, and threw that issue to House
and Senate leaders.
   The bill would require the Justice Department to devise a system
that would allow gun dealers to check whether gun purchasers are
convicted felons _ a provision originally inserted by the House to
replace an optional seven-day waiting period on handgun sales.
   Lawmakers agreed that states would initially have to contribute
25 percent of the cost to receive federal grants for anti-drug
crime programs. After the first year of the four-year program, the
state match would go to 50 percent.
   Senate language that 10 percent of federal anti-crime grants go
for street-level enforcement was dropped, and the decision would be
left to the states.
   The final bill also will include civil fines for those found in
possession of illegal drugs, including marijuana and cocaine.

   Paul Gann, who a decade ago helped
lead this state's revolt against high taxes, is crusading against a
far deadlier foe this November: AIDS, the disease from which he
himself is suffering.
   California law currently prohibits most mandatory AIDS virus
testing and requires that voluntary test results be kept
confidential.
   But Gann, who contracted AIDS in 1982 from a blood transfusion,
is a chief sponsor of Proposition 102, which would eliminate the
statewide anonymous AIDS testing program, allow insurers and
employers to screen prospective clients and workers, and require
health officials to do everything ``reasonably necessary'' to halt
the epidemic, including tracing the contacts of anyone exposed to
the AIDS virus.
   The measure would also make it a felony for anyone who knows
they have acquired immune deficiency syndrome to donate blood or
engage in prostitution.
   State health authorities and other critics insist current
policies are effective. And they warn that AIDS victims and people
who test positive for the AIDS virus could be subjected to housing
and employment discrimination, job loss and other abuses if voters
approve Proposition 102.
   But Gann dismissed those objections at a recent legislative
hearing: ``They (opponents) want to make AIDS a civil rights issue,
but who in God's name has the right to go out and give you a virus
that's going to kill you _ not maybe kill you, but kill you?''
   As part of his campaign, Gann this week called for a boycott of
Wells Fargo Bank because the bank contributed $5,000 to opponents
of the initiative.
   ``They're (the bank) afraid they'll be boycotted by the gay
community,'' Gann told reporters Tuesday, though he could not
provide proof that any boycott had been threatened.
   Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kim Kellogg said the boycott would
probably not be effective. She added that the bank and other
corporations are opposing the initiative because they don't like
it, not out of fear of a boycott.
   A second, more moderate AIDS initiative on Nov. 8 ballots would
allow some mandatory AIDS testing and limited release of test
results.
   Proposition 102's other chief sponsor is U.S. Rep. William
Dannemeyer, a conservative Republican.
   Critics including the California Medical Association, the
California Nurses Association, health officers and numerous AIDS
researchers argue that Proposition 102 would drain support for
programs that have already proven effective in combating the
epidemic, including research, education and voluntary testing.
   Public opinion polls reveal that voter support for Proposition
102 dropped from more than 70 percent early in the campaign to 36
percent by early October as critics have gotten their message out.
   Opponents compare Proposition 102 to two previous ballot
measures sponsored by political extremist Lyndon LaRouche. Those
initiatives, which also enjoyed strong initial support, were
overwhelmingly defeated by voters in 1986 and earlier this year.
But opponents concede their battle is more difficult this time
without LaRouche's name attached to the proposal.
   Health officials argue they can, with consent, trace partners
and other contacts of AIDS victims and people who test positive for
the virus.
   The second AIDS-related measure, Proposition 96, was designed by
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block to help protect rape
victims and law enforcement officials who fear they may have been
exposed to AIDS or other communicable diseases.
   If approved, rape victims and public safety officers could
request mandatory AIDS testing of individuals charged with certain
crimes or involved in an assault on police, firefighters or
emergency medical personnel.
   Supporters call the measure a ``victim's rights'' initiative.
   But critics including the president of the Health Officers'
Association of California fear inmates who have been exposed to
AIDS may be mistreated if test results are reported.
   They also point out that AIDS tests are not a foolproof means of
detecting exposure to the virus.

<HEAD>After Three Decades, Seattle's Westlake Center Opens</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 30 years of committees, proposals and no
small amount of bickering, a downtown center opens this week giving
Seattle a combination town square, office tower, shopping arcade,
bus station and monorail terminal.
   ``That's a minor miracle,'' says Stephen Koehler, president of
Koehler McFayden & Co. of Seattle, one of the project's
co-developers.
   ``There's so many people and so many ideas of what was going to
go into the small space called Westlake, that it's really
impossible to make all the people happy about this. But I think the
overwhelming majority will like what's here.''
   What's here is a 24-story office building, a five-story shopping
and restaurant pavilion and a one-acre city plaza on a roughly
triangular wedge in the middle of the city's retail district. It's
a compromise of three decades of discussions, lawsuits, civic
commissions and studies over what to do with one of the few open
spaces left in Seattle's core.
   ``It's been such a controversial project for so long, I'm just
kind of glad it's done,'' says Mayor Charles Royer.
   Westlake Center was formally opening today amid speeches, bands,
doves and 50,000 balloons.
   Koehler McFayden and The Rouse Co., the Columbia, Md., developer
of such projects as New York's South Street Seaport and Baltimore's
Harborplace, built the $110 million office and shopping complex. It
adjoins the $18.9 million Westlake Park, paved in multi-colored
granite to resemble a Salish Indian basketweave pattern.
   The center's lower level opens to a station of a bus tunnel to
be completed next year. The third floor is the terminus for the
one-mile monorail ride to Seattle Center, site of the 1962 world's
fair.
   Westlake, at the junction of Westlake Avenue, Pine Street and
Fifth Avenue, has long been a place to find flower vendors, hear
street musicians and political speeches, and to duck out of the
rain beneath the old monorail terminal.
   It's also a place to shop. Bordering are large department
stores. A few blocks away is the Pike Place Market, a collection of
fresh fish and vegetable stalls, bakeries, espresso cafes and
open-air entrepreneurs.
   Since the 1950s, when the city closed a two-block stretch of
Westlake Avenue, the site has been the focus for big plans.
Proposals have included a pedestrian mall, a hotel-shopping
complex, a home for the Seattle Art Museum and a central city park.
   Downtown merchants wanted to attract shoppers. Open-space
advocates, including the late Victor Steinbrueck, an architect who
battled to save the Pike Market, wanted a central plaza, a ``living
room'' for the city.
   Steinbrueck, head of the Committee for Alternatives at Westlake,
led a successful legal fight to block a plan by Royer to locate the
art museum at Westlake. That led to the city agreeing to the joint
venture by Rouse and Koehler McFayden in 1983.
   Construction began in January 1987. The result pleases the
developers, satisfies the city and is accepted with mixed feelings
by Steinbrueck's son, Peter.
   ``Seattle lost a great opportunity for a grand square,'' says
Steinbrueck, himself an architect. But, ``I think the park and
shopping pavilion will be a major enhancement to the retail core.''
   Steinbrueck thinks the park is good architecturally. He's less
kind about the center, which he says blocks Westlake Avenue from
the plaza and doesn't fit with nearby buildings. And the ``awful,
tacky blue glass'' of the tower's windows creates an eyesore, he
said.
   Royer says the city has ``a clear winner'' in the retail center,
but thinks it might be a while before the park becomes popular.
   ``It's sort of like a new shoe, it will take a little time for
it to become comfortable as a gathering place,'' said Royer.

<HEAD>Summer Ready-To-Wear Reveals All But Favors Less Leg</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Full pants and long skirts are coming back in a big
way. As ready-to-wear shows for next summer started Wednesday, they
revealed leggy looks in shorts and short skirts, but paid more
attention to longer hemlines.
   For the first time American designer Patrick Kelly gave a tent
show in a courtyard of the Louvre, joining the other big names of
ready-to-wear.
   His clothes were just as jazzy and fun as in past, less orthodox
settings, with plenty of clinging jersey dresses, decorated in dice
this time along with the usual Kelly signature _ buttons.
   The dice also gave pizazz to little, fitted pinstriped suits in
cotton that looked like denim. Flower-and-polka-dot prints on linen
also added fun, topped by fitted jackets with decollete shawl
collars.
   There were a lot of wide, wearable trousers. But Kelly also
stuck to shortie bloomers and full shorts.
   Among the lovely, more wearable clothes were simple, white linen
shift tops decorated with seashells worn with wide shorts or full,
long skirts.
   He based most of his collection on jokes about the Mona Lisa,
showing ``Jungle Lisa'' in safari outfits, skirts, pants and bras
or bustier tops in panther spots. He put Mona Lisa cartoons on
T-shirts, including one of himself framed like the famous portrait.
   Kelly's little, clinging dresses topped with flowers and
flowerbasket hats were as winning as his white jerseys with
multicolored handkerchief trim or bright, multicolored trains.
   And Kelly laid on a Milky Way galaxy of stars and crescent moons
in his stretch jersy numbers for evening.
   In contrast, Marc Bohan's show for Dior was full of clothes that
were chic, wearable and young, though not for the avant-garde.
   He showed plenty of suits, with skirts either above the knee or
nearly ankle-length. Linens and chiffon were mixed up in soft tones
based on blue and beige with dusters topping very full pants or
leaner skirts. Some fun carnation print outfits were topped with
lurex cardigans.
   Suits in acid shades of green, electric pink or turquoise teamed
with taupe sported the type of fitted jacket Bohan used for his
winter couture collection _a tulip front and dipped,
martingale-belted back.
   Notable for daytime were the navy and white chemise dresses and
zigzag prints on little shifts. Unforgettable prints were the giant
daisies on full pants and tie-around blouses for resort wear.
   Lola Lempicka, the suit queen, softened up her line considerably
from strict tailoring of recent seasons. She dropped hemlines in
outfits that had a kind of retro charm borrowed from the colonial
look in India.
   The color scheme was subdued with lots of deep or milk
chocolate, cafe-au-lait, taupe and rosy brown.
   Her hourglass jacket was very long this time, often over a
fluid, pleated voile skirt. Some jackets had a triple row of
buttons down the front and were adorned with lace collars. Others
had guipure embroidery details. Lace insets gave a nostalgic touch
to sleeves.
   Nautical themes like anchors embroidered on trouser suits or
cockades on berets added a cruise-wear touch in navy, white and
rust instead of red, all in the Lempicka nostalgic palette.
   The scooped-neck, fitted bodices over flowered or polka-dotted
skirts had youthful appeal. But black suede sheathes with spangled
tops fitted on the bust like bras lacked the touch of class seen in
most of her collection.

   Taiwanese soldiers stranded on the mainland after
the Communist victory of 1949 have formed an organization to
further their demand that they be allowed to return to Taiwan.
   The Return Home Association represents about 1,000 Taiwan-born
veterans, both of Han and Gaoshan nationality, who were left on the
mainland when the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949, the
official China Daily said today.
   The daily said the non-governmental organization will urge the
Taiwan government to ease restrictions and allow them to return
home to reunite with their relatives.
   It quoted Xu Zhaolin, president of the association, as saying it
would negotiate directly with agencies of Taiwan in third countries
and regions.
   The Nationalist government in 1987 removed restrictions on
travel to the mainland, and more than 150,000 residents of Taiwan
have since traveled to China to visit relatives, sightsee and
conduct business. However, the Nationalists have not made a final
decision on whether mainland residents can visit Taiwan.

<HEAD>Head of National Police Resigns in Palme Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Sweden's police force has
resigned after heavy criticism of his role in an unauthorized
investigation into the 1986 slaying of Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   National Police Chief Nils-Erik Ahmansson told reporters
Wednesday that he decided to step down after Attorney General Hans
Stark said Ahmansson had been too ``passive'' and had given an
outsider access to classified police files concerning the Palme
case.
   Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon resigned under pressure last
June after disclosures of her role in the unauthorized
investigation.
   Leijon admitted helping Ebbe Carlsson, a publisher with close
connections to the governing Social Democratic party, run a private
probe of the Palme murder.
   An associate of Carlsson has been charged with smuggling illegal
wiretapping equipment into Sweden for the probe.
   Last summer, Ahmansson, Leijon and Carlsson testified on
national television before parliament's Constitutional Committee
about their roles in the affair.
   Palme was shot Feb. 28 in downtown Stockholm. The killer is
still at large. Authorities have offered a $7.7 million reward for
information leading to his capture.

<TEXT>
   A former elected official was
sentenced to four life terms Wednesday at the courthouse where he
shot to death a judge, a lawyer, his former sister-in-law and
wounded his ex-wife.
   Clyde Melvin, 63, a former Franklin County commissioner from
nearby Apalachicola, pulled a .357-caliber Magnum revolver from his
boot during a July 28, 1987 alimony hearing at the Gulf County
Courthouse and shot the victims before he was wounded in the neck
by Sheriff Al Harrison.
   Circuit Judge Carl Harper of Pensacola followed a jury's 9-3
recommendation against sending Melvin to Florida's electric chair
for the first-degree murder of Circuit Judge Wilson Lamar Bailey.
Melvin was ordered to serve life in prison without parole for at
least 25 years, the only other sentence possible for that crime.
   Melvin was convicted Sept. 21 in Pensacola of first-degree
murder for shooting Bailey, 64, of Blountstown, through the door of
a bathroom where the judge had dashed for cover.
   He also was convicted of attempted murder for shooting his
ex-wife, Eleanor Inez Huckeba, 60, in the head and second-degree
murder for the slayings of her lawyer, Tom Ingles, 43, of Panama
City, and her sister, Peggy White Paulk, 55, of Panama City Beach.
   Melvin's lawyer, Henry Barksdale, said he believed his client
would be eligible for release when he is 88 _ upon serving the
25-year minimum for Bailey's slaying.
   Melvin's trial was moved to Pensacola because residents of this
Florida Panhandle town, where Melvin had a career as a security
guard at a paper mill, knew too much about the case.
   Melvin and others were privately informed of the sentences
before they were read in open court. Melvin remained seated and
expressed no emotion except for a slight trembling of his cheeks
and chin as the sentences were pronounced.
   He declined an opportunity to make a statement.
   Several relatives of the victims were present. All declined
comment.
   Several psychologists and psychiatrists testified during his
trial that Melvin was paranoid and under great emotional distress
at the time of the slayings. They disagreed, however, on whether he
was legally insane.

   The presidential election is more than two
weeks away but insiders already are predicting that a George Bush
administration would be run by a cast of familiar figures from
Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   With Michael Dukakis far down in the polls and struggling to
recover, his staff says transition planning is on hold. Even so,
Democrats who have been out of power for eight years dream about
the makeup of a Dukakis administration.
   Among Republicans, there is a general expectation that former
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who is Bush's campaign
chairman, would become secretary of State. Former Sen. John Tower
of Texas, an arms negotiator for Reagan and an adviser to Bush on
national security matters, has been lobbying for secretary of
Defense and probably has a claim on it, Republicans say.
   GOP sources say Dick Thornburgh, who replaced Edwin Meese III as
attorney general this year, probably would remain as head of the
Justice Department while Nicholas Brady, a onetime Bush campaign
adviser who replaced Baker at Treasury, would hold onto his job.
   Other likely holdovers in a Bush administration, according to
various sources, are Labor Secretary Ann Dore McLaughlin and
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos. Bush has promised to put a
Hispanic in his Cabinet, and Cavazos fits the bill.
   Reagan's national security adviser, Colin Powell, is rumored
both as a candidate to stay in his current job or to head the CIA.
Otherwise, William Webster, currently the CIA chief, may be asked
to remain, according to sources.
   Craig Fuller, who has been Bush's chief of staff for the past
four years, would have to be considered for the same job in the
White House. New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu also is mentioned for
that post or for a spot in the Cabinet.
   However, political consultant Vic Kamber _ who owns a public
relations firm whose major clients are labor unions _ notes that
Bush's selection of Dan Quayle as his running mate was a ``total
shocker.'' With that in mind, Kamber says, ``We may be in for some
surprises when he (Bush) picks his Cabinet.''
   On the Democratic side, Paul Brountas, a lawyer who is Dukakis'
campaign chairman and a close friend and trusted adviser,
presumably could have any job he wants, including attorney general.
Another longtime adviser, John Sasso, likely would end up as White
House chief of staff.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, the second-ranking Democrat on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee and the chairman of the House
Iran-Contra committee, has been mentioned as a possible secretary
of State under Dukakis.
   For Treasury, the names of Rep. William Gray, D-Penn., chairman
of the House Budget Committee, and investment banker Roger Altman
are frequently mentioned for Dukakis.
   On defense matters, Dukakis turns to the chairmen of the House
and Senate armed service committees, Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and
Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, and they would be regarded as the
leading candidates to head the Pentagon.
   For the record, Bush and Dukakis _ as well as their aides _ do
not talk about whom they would put in their Cabinet. By revealing
their choices before the election, they would alienate people who
weren't picked, and the name of the game now is to offend as few
people as possible.
   ``When they tell me I'm the president of the United States, or
president-elect of the United States, I'll begin picking a
cabinet,'' Dukakis said this week.
   Bush said he would be ready to name a Cabinet quickly, but
dismissed suggestions he already has decided whom he would pick.
   ``I can't let myself think about that. ... I'm not going to do
something that dumb and shift gears,'' Bush told a news conference
Sunday.
   Despite the disclaimers, there has been no shortage of talk
about post-election plums, particularly in the Bush campaign and in
Republican circles.
   It's believed that Clayton Yeutter, the U.S. trade
representative under Reagan, would be happy to be picked by Bush as
secretary of Agriculture. Another name in circulation for that post
is former Iowa Rep. Cooper Evans.
   Jim Burnett, former chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board and currently a member of the panel, has let it be
known he'd like to be secretary of Transportation.
   For the Energy Department, a name frequently mentioned for a
Bush administration is William Martin, a former deputy secretary of
the department who serves as an adviser to Bush. C. Boyden Gray,
counselor to Bush, is believed to be more interested in a White
House post but would go to Energy if asked, sources say.
   Bush also may ask Lee Thomas to remain as chief of the
Environmental Protection Agency, according to sources both at the
agency and within the environmental community. A darkhorse
candidate for the same job is Michael Deland, EPA's regional
administrator in Boston who was the point man in federal efforts to
clean up Boston Harbor.
   For Dukakis, the EPA chief might be Thomas Jorling, head of the
environmental conservation department in New York.
   It's expected that the chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers under Bush would be Stanford University economist Michael
J. Boskin. Under Dukakis, it probably would be Harvard economist
Lawrence H. Summers.
   Richard Darman, a top White House adviser under Reagan who moved
to Treasury as deputy secretary with Baker, likely would be
director of the Office of Management and Budget under Bush.
   David Keene, a GOP political consultant with connections to
Bush, says Zbigniew Brezinski, a Democrat who was President
Carter's national security adviser and now is a supporter of Bush,
would be a good candidate to be U.N. ambassador.
   For the Interior Department, two names mentioned for a Bush
administration are Henry Diamond, a lawyer in environmental
practice, and Nathaniel Reed, former assistant secretary of
Interior for fish and wildlife and parks.
   Under Dukakis, Interior probably would be filled by former
Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt.

Dukakis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scratch a Democrat these days and you'll more
than likely find a budding media consultant with an idea for
television ads to buoy Michael Dukakis' flagging presidential
campaign.
   Some of these proposals lack a practical touch, such as the man
who called to say he had a great idea _ Republican George Bush
driving a truck for Busch Light beer. He wasn't sure how the
Dukakis campaign could get the vice president into the truck with
his rival's cameras rolling.
   But while their advice may be questionable, voters have sensed a
vacuum, one that stems to a large degree from Dukakis' failure to
hone in on a single, strong theme for his overall campaign.
   Since the convention in July, the Democrats have released a
string of seemingly random ads, some negative and some positive,
touching on a wide variety of themes, with little apparent tie-in
to Dukakis' daily campaign speeches and activities.
   By contrast, the Bush campaign and its media, shaped by
political veteran Roger Ailes, have from the start held to a
consistent and unified goal: to paint Bush as a family man with
mainstream values and leadership goals, and Dukakis as an
inexperienced, left-wing robot who is soft on crime, weak on
defense and holds values alien to most Americans.
   Accurate or not, the tactic has worked.
   Dave D'Alessandro, Dukakis' recently hired ad chief, says the
Massachusetts governor's advertising strategy is on target _ as of
last Friday. That was the day two new spots featuring Dukakis
speaking straight into the camera began running on national
television. The campaign also is running a national ad ridiculing
Bush's plan to put his running mate, Dan Quayle, in charge of the
war on drugs.
   But the question pondered by many observers, from academics and
political pros to columnists and average citizens, is why did the
Dukakis campaign take so long to develop its own strategy? Where
was Dukakis in midsummer, when Bush began hammering at his records
on crime and the environment, blasting him as a liberal and raising
issues that put him on the wrong side of patriotism?
   D'Alessandro says he won't answer those questions, since he
didn't come on board until last month. But there is now, he
maintains, a strategy. ``We will show Michael Dukakis as a human
being and who he is,'' he said. ``There's one overarching theme.
Michael Dukakis is on the side of the majority of the people. ...
His theme is that we must regain our stature and our ability to
perform as a country.''
   How the new strategy will be played out on television in the
final weeks of the presidential campaign, both in news coverage and
advertising, is a mystery. But some experts aren't shy about
suggesting what should be done.
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Texas political
scientist and author of three books on campaign media, said the
Dukakis campaign has failed so far to do ``the one thing that
advertising can do well, which is show the private person.''
   She said the campaign should produce an ad similar to one that
shows Bush with his grandchildren at a picnic, in a kitchen and
other domestic settings. The Democrat sorely needs ``something that
shows that when he bends his knees, his pants crease,'' she said,
and recommended some sample footage: a primary-season clip of
Dukakis sitting in a little chair at a nursery school, singing
``Itsy-Bitsy Spider'' with the children.
   That should be combined with four or five hard-hitting attacks
on Bush, Jamieson said, plus some extended into-the-camera
statements on how things would be different under a Dukakis
administration and lots of Hispanic advertising with Dukakis
speaking in Spanish ``about everything they care about.''
   David Axelrod, a Chicago media consultant who did the ads for
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon's presidential campaign, said he would
abandon the effort to humanize Dukakis. ``He's not going to
out-schmaltz Bush and he shouldn't try. And there's no time for
that,'' he said. ``I'd really go hard negative on Bush and try to
shake some people loose.''
   Axelrod said Dukakis ``has lost the battle to define himself and
that was one of the critical mistakes that's been made. He was not
well-known and he allowed the Bush people to paint in the blank
canvas before he did. I don't think there's time now to erase their
picture totally. He has to concentrate instead on chipping away at
Bush's vulnerabilities.''
   D'Alessandro reacts philosophically to the outpouring of advice
_ which even included a call from his own father, who is in the
hospital with a heart ailment and is normally indifferent to
politics.
   ``We have seen all those ideas. We have actually done some,'' he
said, citing as an example a slew of Hispanic ads due to start this
week. But he said 99 percent of the decisions already have been
made, so no more advice is needed. ``We have a strategy. We know
what the issues are. We know what needs to be done.''

   President Reagan, campaigning for Republican
White House hopeful George Bush, had second thoughts about
declaring the opening of a second front for GOP Senate candidates.
   Reagan on Wednesday deleted from the prepared text of a campaign
speech his reference to a broadened political strategy aimed at
giving more focus to Republicans seeking to recapture the Senate.
   On a day in which Bush campaign manager James A. Baker III
accompanied Reagan to tout the ``unprecedented degree of
cooperation'' between the Bush campaign and the White House, Reagan
found himself explaining why he didn't use the ``second-front''
reference in his speech to a campaign rally in Bowling Green, Ohio.
   Asked as he arrived at Cincinnati airport why he had dropped the
phrase, Reagan replied, ``Bcause I didn't think it fit.'' The
president often departs from a prepared speech text to add a joke
or some other thought, but he seldom deletes something that has
been included in a speech and distributed to reporters.
   The deleted portion of the speech said, ``Today, we're opening a
second front.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Reagan
``removed the sentences because he didn't want to inadvertently
give any suggestion that the focus was changing from the election
of George Bush. The president will campaign as if the vice
president were 10 points behind.''
   There has been speculation that the Bush campaign and the
president would make proportionately more appearances through the
remainder of the campaign in states where the GOP might have a
chance of capturing a Senate seat.
   Baker, however, has been urging Bush campaign officials and
workers to avoid seeming overconfident or complacent in view of the
vice president's advantage over Democrat Michael Dukakis in public
opinion polls.
   Baker told reporters he had decided to accompany Reagan on
visits to Columbus, Bowling Green and Cincinnati because Reagan was
appearing for the first time at events financed by the Bush
campaign.
   He called Wednesday the first day the president ``is traveling
on the campaign's nickel.'' Reagan's campaign appearances so far
have been financed either by state Republican parties or the
national party.
   In a conversation with reporters aboard the president's plane,
Baker was asked whether Bush would change his campaign strategy now
that he appears to be leading.
   ``We're not changing our mix of states,'' he replied. ``We've
been campaigning in states where there are Senate races all along.''
   The Democratic Party recaptured the Senate from the Republicans
in 1986, even though Reagan campaigned vigorously for several GOP
candidates who subsequently lost. The Democrats now hold a 54-46
majority in the Senate.
   White House chief of staff Ken Duberstein said that Reagan and
Baker, at some point during the campaign day, discussed what the
president would do to provide further help for Bush.

   Republican nominee George Bush has a sizable but
not an overwhelming lead in the presidential race, and his
advantage relies heavily on disproportionate support from men, new
polls indicate.
   ABC News-Washington Post and Harris polls released Wednesday put
the Bush lead at seven and nine points respectively, both
considerably less than the 17-point Bush lead in an NBC News-Wall
Street Journal poll out Monday.
   The ABC-Post poll, done Oct. 12 through Tuesday, found virtually
no movement since before last week's presidential debate. It put
the race at 52 percent to 45 percent Bush, little different from
its 51-45 result Oct. 5-11.
   John Brennan, an ABC pollster, noted that debates historically
produce little or no sizable change in voter sympathies. The Harris
poll, however, did find movement _ from 50 percent to 48 percent
Bush on Oct. 6-10 to 53-44 now.
   As in other recent surveys, the Harris poll found a continuing
gender gap for Bush, despite his lead. He led among men by 57-40,
but the race among women was about even: Forty-eight percent for
Bush, 49 percent for Dukakis.
   That poll indicated that Bush had gained through his attacks on
Dukakis' stand on crime. Sixty-three percent rated Dukakis as ``too
soft on law enforcement,'' up from 52 percent in late August.
   Also, 49 percent agreed that Dukakis ``seems too liberal in his
views to get my vote,'' a number that has remained more or less
stable in the poll since August. Sixty-nine percent said Dukakis
lacked enough foreign policy experience, down from 75 percent in
August but still high.
   The NBC-Journal poll that had found a 17-point Bush lead was
done Friday through Sunday, and NBC pollster Laurily Epstein said
it could have missed some movement back to Dukakis on Monday after
a big swing to Bush following Thursday's debate.
   Epstein, commenting on the Harris poll before the ABC-Post poll
was released, noted that the Harris and NBC-Journal polls found
nearly the same level for support for the Republicans _ 53 percent
and 55 percent, respectively.
   ``The difference is really on the Democratic side, not the
Republican side,'' she said. ``It may be that we caught the highest
spinoff from the debate,'' which polls and other news accounts said
Bush had won.
   The Harris poll, of 1,356 likely voters, had a margin of error
of plus or minus three points, as did the NBC-Journal poll released
Monday. The ABC-Post poll, of 1,195 likely voters, had an error
margin of about three points.

<HEAD>Metzenbaum Far Ahead Of Challenging Cleveland Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT E. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Howard Metzenbaum is counting on
a third term as an outspoken consumer advocate in the Senate
despite a well-financed and sometimes highly negative challenge
from the mayor of his native Cleveland.
   So far the polls are behind Metzenbaum, who has a reported $10
million bankroll to back up his re-election effort. His Republican
rival, Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, scoffs at the double-digit
leads and says he'll benefit from a grassroots effort in all 88
Ohio counties in the final days and George Bush's presidential
coattails.
   Voinovich's campaign indicates he will have spent up to $8
million, but possibly as much as $10 million, by Nov. 8 on what has
been largely a battle of television commercials, selected pot
shots, and what some newspapers have called unprecedented sleaze on
television.
   The campaign is being fought over a variety of issues, and each
has charged the other with changing past positions for political
expediency.
   Metzenbaum concedes that he has changed his position on capital
punishment, from outright opposition to favoring the death sentence
for drug pushers, who he said can afford competent lawyers.
Metzenbaum voted for such penalties in the Senate drug bill.
   Metzenbaum denied Voinovich's charge that he changed because
polls show most Ohioans favor capital punishment.
   Metzenbaum says Voinovich called for cuts in Social Security
three separate times before announcing he was against any
reductions.
   Metzenbaum was angered by Voinovich television commercials that
accused him of being soft on child pornography. On Oct. 10, he
withdrew his summer-long promises for a fall debate, saying, ``The
gutter is not a fitting place for a debate.''
   Voinovich claimed in the ads that Metzenbaum used his position
on the Senate Judiciary Committee to block a measure that would
have dealt harshly with child pornography.
   Metzenbaum, however, said he was concerned about a provision in
the legislation that he claimed was unconstitutional and that the
Justice Department concurred with his position. Metzenbaum later
supported the bill after the provision was revised.
   Voinovich said Metzenbaum is afraid to discuss his record. But
he admitted that the commercials, which drew criticism from several
major newspapers, produced an unexpected ``boomerang effect.''
   He insisted his allegations were true but said his campaign
should have set out to prove the charges in another way.
   Voinovich, though mayor of Cleveland since he defeated Dennis
Kucinich less than a year after the city went into default in 1978,
also dealt with statewide issues as lieutenant governor to James A.
Rhodes.
   As mayor he presided over Cleveland's fiscal recovery, and as
past president of the National League of Cities he often criticized
the Reagan administration's urban policies.
   Still, Voinovich is borrowing lines from Reagan and benefiting
from the president's visits to Ohio. On the stump, Voinovich, 52,
charges that the 71-year-old Metzenbaum is a liberal who is ``out
of touch with Ohio's mainstream,'' having voted for higher taxes
and cuts in defense spending while championing left-wing causes and
opposing legislation to help industry create jobs.
   ``Two-thirds of his bankroll comes from out of state,''
Voinovich has charged.
   Most of Metzenbaum's speeches and ads center on his record and
claims of numerous accomplishments that include safer baby
formulas, help for victims of rare diseases, and a law requiring 60
days' notice of plant closings.
   On the attack, Metzenbaum contends Voinovich waffled over the
plant closing law, once vetoed by Reagan, and that the mayor has
given tacit approval to right-wing groups that have tried to paint
the incumbent as a communist sympathizer.
   Voinovich said he has asked the most visible of those groups, a
Goodbye Metzenbaum Club that raises money and sends mailings from
Cincinnati, to back off. But he said the club had persisted and
that by competing with him for money, ``They have actually hurt
me.''
   Metzenbaum, responding to Voinovich charges that he is a pawn of
labor, described himself as ``fiercely independent'' in recurring
battles against corporate lobbyists and pressure groups that he
said are pouring money into the Republican's campaign.
   ``There isn't a hit list anywhere between New York and
California that doesn't have Howard Metzenbaum at the top, '' the
senator said.
   Metzenbaum's committee assignments include Energy and Natural
Resources, Judiciary, Labor and Human Resources and the Select
Committee on Intelligence.

<HEAD>House Report Says It's Too Easy To Get Government Security
Clearance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Obtaining a government security clearance is
almost as easy as getting a credit card, a critical report on
federal efforts to curb spying suggests.
   The report by the House Intelligence Committee concludes that
officials don't do enough to scrutinize employees before they are
granted bottom-level security clearances and don't keep a close
enough eye on those who are privy to the nation's most sensitive
secrets.
   While some progress in protecting against spying has been made
since a harsher report was issued two years ago, bureaucratic
food-dragging has kept counterintelligence gains below what they
should be, the panel said Wednesday.
   Evidence of the lack of progress is the continuing discovery of
new spy cases in which disgruntled employees or former government
officials have eluded detection for months or years, according to
the report.
   One example of the shortcomings is that many security clearances
continue to be granted without checking applicants' financial or
employment backgrounds, despite repeated past recommendations that
those criteria be included. ``The committee finds this failure to
act inexcusable,'' the report said.
   Asked whether that meant getting a security clearance is easier
than opening a charge account, oversight subcommittee chairman
Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif., said, ``That's probably true.''
   The government's basic security review, known as the National
Agency Check, involves reviewing FBI fingerprint files and dossiers
at other federal agencies. It does not include credit and
employment checks, and costs just $10 to complete.
   ``We ... spend thousands for physical security measures in some
programs (to protect) secret material, but for the people part of
it, we are only willing to spend $10,'' Thomas J. O'Brien,
then-director of the Defense Investigative Service, said in
testimony before the panel last spring. ``All of our losses have
come from people.''
   The panel's report found a pattern of bureaucratic sluggishness
throughout the intelligence community in addressing security
problems and it criticized a preoccupation with hardware and
gadgetry that ignores fundamental personnel problems.
   It also found that little has been done to control the
proliferation of classified information and concluded that top CIA
personnel were the sources of many revelations in Washington Post
reporter Bob Woodward's book ``Veil'' about covert operations by
the CIA.
   The Intelligence panel voted unanimously to release the report,
overriding objections from the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA
had no comment on the document.
   The Pentagon came in for particular criticism in the committee's
review, which noted that at least 54 Defense Department personnel
have been identified and punished over the past five years for
espionage or security breaches. Despite the problems, the
department does not appear to be looking vigorously for new
solutions, the report said.
   While the Pentagon claims to have reduced its security-cleared
personnel from 4.2 million to 2.8 million over the past three
years, the figures cannot be verified, the panel said.
   And with that many cleared personnel in addition to 1.1 million
clearances for defense contractors, the secretary of defense has
only six professional staff members overseeing department security
programs. ``This is a penny-wise and pound-foolish approach,
considering these personnel have access to the nation's most
sensitive data,'' the report found.
   As an example of failures in security screening of personnel,
the report cites the case of Glen Michael Souther, a former Navy
intelligence specialist.
   While in the Navy years ago in Norfolk, Va., Souther's wife
voiced suspicions to a Naval officer that her husband might be
involved in espionage. He left the Navy, went to Old Dominion
University for Russian studies, then rejoined the Navy as a
reservist and was granted a top security clearance.
   A background investigation did not catch the warning signs, and
Souther defected this year to the Soviet Union, taking with him
classified technical data on weapons systems.
   The panel also sought answers from the CIA about the sources of
disclosures in Woodward's book, published last year. The book
contains numerous references to intelligence details that were not
widely known, and one agency official testified: ``I don't think
there is a question. ... I think it came from within the agency.''

<HEAD>School Program Spiked After Reviewer Complained About Lack of Nazi
Views</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Reagan administration official who refused
to fund a school study program on the Holocaust acknowledges that
her decision was based in part on reviews including one complaining
that the views of Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan weren't included.
   Supporters of the Holocaust program entitled ``Facing History
and Ourselves'' contend that the review boards set up to assess the
merits of the program for the Education Department were
ideologically slanted and predisposed to recommend it not be funded.
   But Shirley Curry, a political appointee in the department, said
criticism that ``somehow the department in general and I in
particular have operated in some anti-Semitic mode ... is
absolutely absurd.''
   She told a House Government Operations subcommittee Wednesday
that the program was denied $70,000 in federal funds three times.
Those decisions were made either because the program scored low in
critiques prepared by panels of outside reviewers or because, as
was the case this year when the program received a relatively high
score, a money squeeze prevented funding of an entire category of
programs.
   ``We looked at categories that we needed and that is what we
funded,'' she said.
   She said she supports secondary school programs examining the
Holocaust, the Nazis' systematic killing of some 6 million Jews
during World War II. She said the ``Facing History'' curriculum
would have received a grant if money had been available ``to fund
everything.''
   The program was first denied a federal grant in 1986 after a
member of an outside review panel faulted it for not including the
opinions of the Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan. In 1987, a
reviewer called it ``leftist,'' anti-war, anti-hunting'' and
``offensive to (Christian) fundamentalits.'' Another reviewer said
it was likely to produce a ``guilt trip.''
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., told the witness: ``The fact is that
you selected these reviewers and you gave full weight to their
scores. These two offensive, wacko opinions were given full weight.
   ``Did you discount them for being crazy?'' he asked.
   Curry: ``The scores were recorded.''
   Frank: ``Were these scores given the same weight as others?''
   Curry: ``Yes.''
   Frank: ``You read them. You gave them full weight. Shame on the
department.''
   Responding to further questions, Curry said that at the time the
Holocaust program was being considered, she was a member of the
Eagle Forum, whose president is conservative activist Phyllis
Schlafly.
   Mrs. Schlafly, in a 1987 letter to an Education Department
official, urged that the grant application for the program be
rejected. She said it employed ``psychological manipulation,
induced behavioral change and privacy-invading treatment.''
   Asked if Mrs. Schlafly's position had any impact on the decision
not to fund the program, Curry replied, ``Not in my book.''
   Curry said she was reassigned last Friday from her position as
director of the department's National Diffusion Recognition
Division to become a special assistant to the assistant to the
deputy secretary for management.
   She said she plans to leave her $57,000 a year position by the
end of the year and hesitated when asked what her new duties would
be.
   Rep. Frank told the witness: ``It seems to me that they moved
you to a political position for a month or two to avoid political
embarrassment and gave you a month or two vacation at a $57,000 a
year salary.''
   Margot Stern Strom of Brookline, Mass., who was instrumental in
developing the Holocaust teaching project for Facing History and
Ourselves National Foundation Inc., said the initial review
comments on the program were ``beyond my imagination.''
   She said she and her colleagues concluded that the outside
review system amounted to ``an ideological screen to permit the
department to deny funding to `Facing History.'''
   ``My own reading of the comments showed an extraordinarily
narrow bias on the part of the reviewers,'' she said.

   Hurricane Joan churned toward
Central America with 120 mph winds Wednesday and forced thousands
to evacuate coastal areas after it left 35 people dead or missing
in Colombia.
   ``It will hit Nicaragua or Costa Rica if it keeps on this track,
but there will also be heavy rainfall in Panama,'' said forecaster
Max Mayfield at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   He said the eye of the storm probably would hit the coast early
Friday and that mountainous areas could suffer flash flooding and
mudslides in the coming days.
   Rainfall of 5 to 10 inches was forecast for the storm's path.
The hurricane center said parts of Panama, Costa Rica and Nicaragua
might get even heavier rains.
   The Colombian islands of San Andres, Albuquerque and Providencia
were under a hurricane warning, and a watch was posted for the
Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
   Joan swept across Colombia's Guajira Peninsula as a tropical
storm Monday and became a hurricane Tuesday. It killed 15, left 20
missing, injured 50 and flooded or destroyed the homes of 27,000
people, Colombia's National Emergency Committee said Wednesday.
   Preliminary reports from Colombian officials on Tuesday said 50
people were dead or missing.
   At midnight Wednesday, the storm was centered near latitude 11.3
north and longitude 79.8 west, about 160 miles east-southeast of
San Andres or 280 miles east of Bluefields, Nicaragua. It was
moving west at 5-10 mph and maximum sustained winds were near 120
mph.
   ``What we're really concerned about is that we have not had a
Category 3 hurricane before in this portion of the Caribbean,''
Mayfield said. ``We are very concerned that the people down there
have never experienced anything like this.''
   A Category 3 storm has maximum sustained winds from 111 mph to
130 mph.
   Eladio Zarate, head of Costa Rica's weather service, said
evacuations continued in the coastal towns of Puerto Limon,
Tortuguero, Colorado, Manitas and Pueblo Nuevo.
   ``If Joan hits Puerto Limon, its could cause a lot of damage,''
he said. At least 5,000 people fled Puerto Limon on Wednesday and
another 3,000 evacuated from other coastal towns, said Johnny
Alfaro, national emergency committee director in Puerto Limon.
   ``We expect that tonight, most of the 10,000 residents of Limon
will be out of the city,'' he said.
   Hundreds of people lined up for buses to flee Puerto Limon, 100
miles southeast of San Jose, the capital. Some said they were
afraid there wouldn't be enough transportation for everyone.
   ``We could die,'' said Alfaro Valverde, 58, as he waited in line.
   In Nicaragua, the national airline Aeronica suspended flights to
Bluefields, on a remote stretch of the Miskito Coast about 180
miles east of Managua, the capital.
   ``If the hurricane stays over water, it is possible its full
force will hit Bluefields Thursday morning or Friday morning. It
could be a disaster because most of the buildings there are of
wood,'' said Alejo Moreno, head of the Nicaraguan weather service.
   Civil Defense officials in Nicaragua said Tuesday that they had
enough emergency supplies only for ``immediate needs.'' They said
the 7-year war with the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras has
drained their reserves.
   Joan is the fifth hurricane of the Atlantic season. In
September, Hurricane Gilbert left more than 300 people dead and
caused widespread damage in Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican
Republic and the Cayman Islands.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Speedup Of Drug Approvals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is hoping to
speed therapies for AIDS and other life-threatening diseases to
market by formally encouraging pharmaceutical companies to work
with the agency in the earliest stages of drug development.
   In announcing publication of the new regulations in the Federal
Register on Wednesday, FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young acknowledged
that they essentially ``codify'' what the agency already is doing.
   The Federal Register notice itself says that ``although the
(new) program is important, it builds upon managerial and
regulatory options available under existing practices and
procedures.''
   Young said the new mechanism _ which essentially allows a drug
company to bypass final-stage drug testing _ was similar to that
used in approval last year of AZT, still the only recognized drug
for treatment of AIDS.
   He said at a news conference that the agency is not weakening
the safety and efficacy standards its uses in moving a drug from
experimental to broad use, but wants to compress the time needed to
reach a conclusion on those standards.
   ``This is the agency's best attempt to change its image from
being umpire _ just calling safe or out _ to being more involved,
like the catcher calling signals,'' said Young.
   Another analogy he used was that of a college professor giving
students a clear idea of what was being looked for in an essay test
question rather than leaving them to try to guess the key points
the teacher wanted addressed.
   Translated to the drug approval process, Young said, the idea
was to let drug companies know in early stages of testing which
scientific questions the agency considered most crucial to address
in follow-up testing.
   The move will not satisfy many AIDS activists who, in effect,
want the FDA to scuttle its historic role and sign off on safety
and effectiveness of potential AIDS drugs before the agency has
satisfied itself those criteria have been met.
   Without such FDA sanction, physicians not participating in
approved experiments _ with all the attendant red tape and
reporting requirements _ are reluctant to use experimental
therapies on their patients even though the drugs sometimes are
available from foreign sources. The doctors could face severe
liability problems if such treatments backfire.
   Another underlying issue is that health insurance normally does
not pay for experimental drug treatment, but often does once the
FDA approves a drug.
   Hundreds of demonstrators temporarily shut down the FDA
headquarters building in nearby Rockville, Md., last week to demand
more access to experimental drugs for AIDS treatment.
   However, the protest appears to have had no direct bearing on
Wednesday's announcement since it invokes the same FDA policy Young
had outlined for demonstration leaders in a meeting several days
before the protest.
   Young also traveled to Boston earlier this year to defend the
FDA position at an international conference of gay and lesbian
groups active in pushing for more experimental AIDS treatment.
   The timing of Wednesday's announcement, three weeks before the
election, was another question.
   Young insisted that the timing of the announcement _ which
referred to Vice President George Bush as having spearheaded the
administration's task force on regulatory reform _ was not
politically motivated.
   ``This is the time in the continuity of all the things we have
been doing to come forth with this,'' he said in response to a
question. ``We've been working on this a long time, so I reject
that.''
   Jean McGuire, executive director of the AIDS Action Council, had
distributed statements in advance of Young's news conference
charging, ``The rationale for timing the announcement at this point
is transparent at best.''
   She called the announcement ``politically opportunistic and
potentially misleading.''
   The National Gay & Lesbian Task Force said, ``The substance and
timing of the FDA's announcement raises questions as to whether
this is a pre-election gambit rather than a serious attempt to make
promising experimental therapies available to those with
life-threatening illnesses.''
   Mathilde Krim, a founder of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, was more receptive. ``These are sound proposals,'' she
said, ``but there's a big catch. They come without significant
dollars attached.''
   Young insisted that additional FDA staffers authorized by
Congress for last year and the coming year _ 126 new positions in
each year _ leave the agency capable of assessing any new potential
AIDS drugs on the near horizon.
   Young acknowledged that utilization of the newly published
regulation would require drug developers to make a larger financial
commitment up front than is the current practice.
   That is because they essentially would have to spend more on
preliminary human trials long before they have a good feel for
whether the drug under development eventually will win market
approval and thus return the research investment.
   Under the traditional three-phase testing procedure, a company
has had considerable experience with a new drug before it goes into
the expensive final test phase in which hundreds of patients are
given an experimental drug at multiple centers around the nation.
   If the expanded _ and more expensive _ phase two tests show
conclusively that the drug is safe and effective, the third phase
would be dispensed with and the drug approved for market.
   Jeffrey C. Warren, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, said the trade group supports the FDA
plan and, in fact, had pushed for it.
   ``We have long believed that all drugs must be approved more
rapidly and we believe extraordinary steps in the case of AIDS and
other life-threatening diseases are necessary,'' he said.

   The ``greenhouse effect'' warming the earth is
likely to raise ocean levels but lower the Great Lakes, reduce
crops across the South and turn some northern forests into
grasslands, according to a major government study.
   The unreleased report by the Environmental Protection Agency
says low-lying coastal areas equal in size to the state of
Massachusetts could be submerged.
   Congress directed EPA to perform major studies on the effects of
the greenhouse effect and what can be done about it. Both studies
are expected to be submitted to Congress in December. A draft of
the summary of the effects report was obtained Wednesday by The
Associated Press.
   The ``greenhouse effect'' is the expected warming of the Earth
from the growing concentration of gases in the atmosphere that keep
heat from being radiated out to space. The principal greenhouse
gas, carbon dioxide, has increased 10 percent since 1958 and
continued worldwide use of fossil fuels and destruction of tropical
rain forests point to further increases.
   Some computer models have predicted that droughts could be more
frequent in the Midwest and Southeast in the coming century as a
result of the global warming. The EPA report says this year's
drought across the United States should serve as a warning, even
though precise predictions are impossible.
   ``We cannot anticipate how changing technology, new scientific
advances, urban growth and changing demographics will affect the
world of the next century,'' EPA analysts write.
   ``In this report we did not analyze or anticipate the reductions
in barge shipments due to lower river levels, the increases in
forest fires due to dry conditions, or the impacts on ducks due to
disappearing prairie potholes. All these impacts were made vivid
during the past year.
   ``The drought dramatically reminded us of our vulnerability as a
nation but it cannot be viewed as a prediction of things to come.
... Until a severe event occurs such as the drought of 1988, we
fail to recognize the close links between our society, the
environment and climate.''
   Most scenarios say the Earth will warm on average by three to
eight degrees Fahrenheit in the middle of the next century. This
will expand the volume of the oceans and melt some glaciers,
causing a rise in average sea levels estimated at 20 inches to 6{
feet.
   The report says it could cost $73 billion to $111 billion to
protect developed coastal areas from sea level increases, but 4,100
square miles to 9,200 square miles still would be lost. The land
area of Massachusetts is 7,826 square miles.
   Environmental groups have urged drives to improve energy
efficiency and conservation, and to replant forests, which absorb
carbon dioxide. Just last week, a power company in Connecticut said
it would help plant trees in Guatemala that would offset the carbon
dioxide its new plant would emit over the next 40 years.
   In its studies, EPA convened panels of experts, searched the
scientific literature and ran computer models of the global climate.
   Some potential effects it foresees:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Agriculture</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   U.S. food production is likely to remain adequate for domestic
consumption, although export capacity is uncertain. ``Higher
temperatures across the country will shift relative agricultural
productivity northward.''
   A moderate warming actually could bring economic benefits, but
changes would be ``negative with the hotter, drier climate change
scenario.''
   ``Yields of dryland corn, wheat and soybeans could decline under
higher temperatures at particular sites by up to 80 percent, mostly
in the South. In very northern areas such as Minnesota, dryland
yields of corn and soybeans could double as warmer temperatures
extend the frost-free growing season.
   ``Crop acreage in Appalachia, the Southeast and the Southern
Great Plains could decrease by 5 percent to 25 percent, acreage in
the northern Great Lakes states, the northern Great Plains and the
Pacific Northwest could increase by 5 percent to 17 percent.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Forests</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The actual range of forests is likely to be reduced for
centuries because the southern boundary may advance more quickly
than the northern boundary.''
   Declines may be visible in 30 years in Mississippi and northern
Minnesota. Those forests ``appear to be very sensitive to small
changes in climate.''
   ``In central Michigan, forests now dominated by sugar maple and
oak may be replaced by grasslands, with some sparse oak trees
surviving.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Coasts and Water</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Some coastal wetlands could survive rising sea levels by
migrating inland, but one study estimated that if sea levels rose
about 3\ feet, ``26 percent to 66 percent of wetlands would be lost
even if wetland migration is not blocked.''
   Heat stress could reduce shellfish harvests in the South, but
bass and lake trout harvests in the Great Lakes could increase.
   Higher temperatures could reduce snow pack and increase
evaporation, both of which would lower the Great Lakes, reducing
shipping capacity but leading to a longer shipping season. Lake
Superior could fall 1.5 feet and Lake Michigan by as much as 8 feet.
   Higher temperatures and less snow pack also imply that ``water
management systems such as those in California would be unlikely to
maintain current yields.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Air Quality</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Higher temperatures would increase urban smog. A case study of
San Francisco showed a 20 percent increase in ozone levels for a
seven-degree temperature increase and a doubling of the size of the
land area there that does not meet federal air quality standards.

<HEAD>Cedar Rapids Best Place to Live, Gary Worst, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest entry in the popular game of rating
places concludes that Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is the nation's best spot
to live. Gary, Ind., the report says, finished last.
   Zero Population Growth, a Washington interest group, issued its
ratings of about 190 cities on Wednesday, comparing them according
to a variety of population and environmental factors in what it
called an ``urban stress test.''
   Just a week earlier an unrelated study, also seeking to rate
urban stress, was published by Psychology Today magazine. Done by
Robert Levine of California State University in Fresno, that report
pronounced Reno, Nev., the most stressful spot in the nation and
said State College, Pa., has the least stress.
   Other recent rankings have included:
   _Money magazine, which said Danbury, Conn., was best and placed
Atlantic City, N.J., last.
   _Etiquette expert Marjabelle Young Stewart, who said Charleston,
S.C., is the best mannered community. She did not name a most
boorish spot.
   _Several books and almanacs rating cities, colleges and
retirement communities, among other things.
   The newly issued ratings took a year to compile, according to
Zero Population Growth, which looked at population and
environmental factors, in contrast to Levine, who studied the human
response to stress.
   Cedar Rapids got a stress rating of 1.6 from ZPG, edging out
Madison, Wis., which had a 1.7 rating, and Ann Arbor, Mich., and
Lincoln, Neb., which each rated 1.8.
   Not surprisingly, Todd Bergen of the Cedar Rapids Chamber of
Commerce agreed that his city is ``a great place to live.''
   ``Things move here at a perfect pace, life isn't too fast, it
isn't too slow. We enjoy what we do and we enjoy living here,''
said Bergen in a telephone interview.
   Gary, on the other hand, was rated 4.2. Not much better, with
ratings of 4.1, were Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Jersey City and
Pomona, Calif.
   Maxine Young, executive director of the Gary chamber of
commerce, disputed that conclusion, contending that many outsiders
have heard myths about her city.
   ``We're an industrial town, a hard working town. ... We're not
offering sunshine and blue skies; we're offering a good solid
community in which to live, work and play,'' she said, stressing
the city's school system and parks.
   Gary has suffered economically in recent years, she said, ``but
we are making a comeback.''
   The Zero Population Growth study ranks communities according to
population change and density, support for education, crime rates,
economics, air quality, hazardous wastes, water and sewage. It
gives from 1 to 5 points _ fewer is better _ and then averages them
for the overall score.
   Levine's report used four factors _ rates of alcoholism, crime,
suicide and divorce.
   His top spot, State College, Pa., wasn't included in the ZPG
study, which concentrated on cities of 100,000 people or more _ or
the largest city in states with no city that large. State College
had 34,330 in 1986, the latest Census Bureau estimate. Reno, last
in Levine's list, managed a relatively good 2.8 rating from ZPG.
   His report ranked Cedar Rapids 55th out of 286 and placed the
region including Gary, Hammond and East Chicago in 118th place.
   Zero Population Growth said the best large city _ that is, with
a half-million people or more _ was Columbus, Ohio, with a 2.6
rating.
   And it gave Virginia Beach, Va., a 2.4 to make it best among the
cities of 250,000 to 500,000 residents.
   Madison topped the 150,000 to 250,000 category and Cedar Rapids
was best small city on the list.
   Zero Population Growth is a non-profit membership group which
describes itself as working to achieve a sustainable balance of
population, environment and resources. It places considerable
emphasis on slowing population growth and, in its rankings, the
larger the community was, the poorer its rankings tended to be.
   Overpopulation is not just a Third World problem, said Susan
Weber, executive director of the group. ``It affects typical
American communities ... accelerating crime rates, diminishing air
and water quality, shrinking open space,'' she commented.
   While the ZPG study didn't provide rankings for all of the
cities it rated, here are their 10 best and worst:
   The top 10 plus ties: Cedar Rapids, 1.6; Madison, Wis., 1.7; Ann
Arbor, Mich., 1.8; Lincoln, Neb., 1.8; Fargo, N.D., 1.9; Livonia,
Mich., 1.9; Concord, Calif., 2.0; Alexandria, Va., 2.1; Eugene,
Ore., 2.1; Roanoke, Va., 2.1; Worcester, Mass., 2.1.
   The bottom 10 plus ties: Gary, 4.2; Baltimore, 4.1; Chicago,
4.1; Houston, 4.1; Jersey City, 4.1; Pomona, Calif., 4.1; El Paso,
Texas, 4.0; Cleveland, 3.9; Fort Worth, Texas, 3.9; Inglewood,
Calif., 3.9; Los Angeles, 3.9; St. Louis, 3.9.

<HEAD>Corn Belt Congressmen Urge Use of Biodegradable Plastic Grocery
Bag</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Corn Belt member of Congress is looking at
the plastic grocery bag as a way of carrying grain farmers to
better times, while improving the environment along the way.
   A new, biodegradable plastic bag is made partly from cornstarch.
When it's tossed away and buried in a landfill, it decomposes in a
few months, compared with a century or two for regular plastic bags.
   Rep. Jim Jontz, D-Ind., recently sent letters to major grocery
stores and other retailers asking them to consider a trial program
using the biodegradable plastic bags.
   A spokesman, Tom Buis, said Wednesday that the proposal still is
being debated but that it has had a ``very positive'' reception so
far from Indiana storekeepers.
   Jontz said in his letter that the trial program would
``demonstrate to the public the benefits to our environment and our
economy of using products made from biodegradable plastics.''
   Also, he said, the use of cornstarch in the bags would help
farmers. ``Corn is Indiana's No. 1 crop, and farmers in our state
would benefit immensely from the increased use of biodegradable
plastics made from cornstarch,'' Jontz said.
   A number of farm and trade groups also support the plastic bag
idea, including the National Corn Growers Association and many of
its state affiliates.
   In Jefferson City, Mo., biodegradable bags are being used in a
60-day testing program, the first city-wide campaign to see if the
cornstarch mixture is practical for trash pickups.
   According to the Agriculture Department, research chemists Felix
H. Otey and Richard P. Westhoff developed processes for using
cornstarch in plastic at the department's Northern Research Center,
Peoria, Ill.
   The USDA processes were licensed for use and further development
by Agri-Tech Industries Inc., Gibson City, Ill., and for sale to
other companies.
   One firm, Rollpak Corp. of Goshen, Ind., began operation this
year, making plastic trash bags made of 7 percent cornstarch. When
soil bacteria and fungi consume the starch, the remaining
polyethylene crumbles into small particles that the organisms can
break down easily.
   Gary Weaver, vice president of Rollpak, said the new bags
degrade in two to three years, compared with 100 years or more for
regular plastic. And some plastics take 300 to 400 years, he said.
   One problem has been the greater cost of the cornstarch plastic
bags, each priced 10 percent to 20 percent more than regular
plastic bags, according to Weaver.
   Jontz noted the additional expense in his letter to storekeepers
but added that ``the benefits of demonstrating to the public the
advantages of biodegradable plastic are also appreciable.''

   Milk production has slowed from earlier
expectations but still could increase enough in 1988 to set a
record, says the Agriculture Department.
   Part of the slowdown was attributed to higher feed costs
resulting from the drought-reduced grain harvests.
   Milk output declined in 1987 to 142.5 billion pounds from a
record 143.4 billion pounds in 1986. This year's production was
forecast last spring to rise 2 percent to 3 percent from 1987.
   But the department's Economic Research Service said Wednesday in
its new outlook report that 1988 milk production may increase only
``around 1 percent'' from last year's level. That could still
exceed the record level of two years ago.
   ``Milk cow numbers have slipped since January and were almost 1
percent below a year ago in July-September,'' the report said.
``Meanwhile, milk (production) per cow posted a moderate 2 percent
rise from a year ago. Both milk per cow and milk cow numbers are
expected to weaken further.''
   The report added that the effects of the higher feed costs next
year ``will be magnified because milk production was already easing
when the drought began'' as a result of a series of cuts in
government supports.
   ``If crops are good (next year) and feed prices decrease,
production probably will strengthen as 1989 progresses,'' the
report said. ``However, 1989 milk production might not match the
1988 record.''
   The seasonal rise in retail prices of dairy products in the
second half of this year ``will be larger than in recent years,''
the report said. ``Even so, the increase will not be out of line
with increases in prices of all food or all items.''
   Overall, it said, consumer prices of milk and other dairy
products in 1988 probably will average about 2 percent more than in
1987.

   The Agriculture Department says the European
Economic Community could give U.S. farmers competition from
subsidized corn exports in the coming year.
   France expects a record corn harvest and could face reduced
exports to other members of the 12-nation EEC, the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service said Wednesday in a brief trade report.
   ``Italy, traditionally the major market for surplus French corn,
is anticipating a larger corn crop and reduced imports,'' the
report said. ``As a result, France may petition the (EEC)
commission for the additional export restitutions necessary to
subsidize the sale of surpluses into third-country markets.''

<HEAD>Fraud, Misconduct Factors in 75 Percent of S&L Failures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fraud and misconduct touch one of every four
savings and loan institutions and play a part in more than
three-quarters of all S&L failures, a congressional report
concludes.
   ``The U.S. government is now confronting a growing and long-term
epidemic of ... abuse, misconduct and criminality in financial
institutions,'' said the study, released Wednesday by a panel of
the House Government Operations Committee.
   The problem among commercial banks is serious but not as severe,
the report said. It linked a third of all bank failures to
misconduct.
   William B. O'Connell, president of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, acknowledged that fraud ``played a significant role''
in some past S&L failures.
   But he maintained that the report, which covered the 3{ years
between 1984 and June 1987, ``does not portray the savings
institution business of today.''
   ``Extensive background checks are now made to keep the crooks
and high fliers out of our business. Those who did slip in earlier
in this decade are now gone,'' he said.
   The House study comes during the worst year for failures of both
banks and S&Ls since the Depression and amid congressional debate
over whether taxpayers will be required to bail out the fund
insuring S&L deposits.
   Federal regulators estimate it will cost $45 billion to $50
billion to restore the savings industry to health. Private analysts
put the price tag as high as $100 billion.
   According to Rep. Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., chairman of the
Government Operations subcommittee on monetary affairs, recent
efforts by the Justice Department to combat bank fraud have been
``severely hindered'' since April when department officials
transferred $1.1 million in travel money to one of former Attorney
General Edwin Meese III's favored projects, an anti-obscenity task
force.
   The report said Justice Department attorneys working on bank
fraud cases have been forced to stop traveling to some cities. The
result has been a significant delay in investigations, it said.
   Nearly half of bank and savings and loan failures are
concentrated in Texas and other Southwestern states suffering
economically from the collapse of oil prices in 1986.
   But industry critics say many of the institutions have been
victims of highflying owners and officers who misused their insider
status, running up huge losses through recklessness and sometimes
outright fraud.
   The Barnard panel said regulators found misconduct in 168 of 210
S&L insolvencies during the 3{ years ending in June 1987. They also
found it in another 313 ailing S&Ls and 295 healthy institutions.
All told, that represented about 25 percent of the entire industry,
the report said.
   At commercial banks, 98 of 354 failures in 1985, 1986 and the
first half of 1987 were associated with fraud and insider abuse.
   O'Connell, however, said the report's numbers ``appear to be
overblown.'' He said they categorize ``minor and perhaps
unintentional infractions of complex regulations'' as misconduct.
   At the end of June, 7,350 bank and S&L cases were being
investigated by the FBI and federal grand juries. Forty-six percent
involved losses of $100,000 and more, and a third involved
institutions in Texas, California and Florida. Those three states
have been criticized for lax banking regulations.
   Barnard's subcommittee offered a laundry list of
recommendations, including:
   _The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which regulates about half
of the nation's commercial banks, should increase its examination
force from 2,035 to 2,300 inspectors. It should boost the pay of
senior and mid-level examiners to stem a 10 percent turnover rate.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates
nationally chartered banks and lost a third of its senior
executives in 1986 and 1987 to higher paying jobs, also needs to
increase salaries.
   _The FBI should end its practice of assigning junior agents to
bank fraud cases and of transferring them to other jobs when they
gain experience.
   _The Justice Department should ensure that enough money is set
aside for travel by fraud unit attorneys. It should seek more money
from Congress and hire more lawyers for U.S. attorney offices.

<HEAD>Reagan Gets Bill Requiring Disclosure of Credit Card Data</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers would get more details about the
costs of credit cards _ and get them sooner _ than required by
current federal and state laws under legislation being sent to
President Reagan.
   In the blink of an eye, the House on Wednesday approved by voice
vote legislation to require banks, department stores and other
issuers of credit cards to provide more information to consumers
about interest rates and other charges.
   It had been anticipated that the House would take a roll call
vote on the measure, which was opposed by Rep. Frank Annunzio,
D-Ill., chairman of the House consumer subcommittee. He had delayed
final approval of the measure last week when it first came up on
the floor.
   However, when the measure came up for a vote, it was passed
quickly and sent to the White House for the president's signature.
The Senate approved the measure by voice vote last week.
   Except for Annunzio's objection, there was little other
opposition to the bill. Banking groups had worked for passage of
the measure because it would prevent states from imposing a
patchwork of differing disclosure requirements in what is clearly
an interstate industry. In addition, a chief sponsor, Rep. Charles
E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and others _ except for Annunzio _ had long ago
given up on trying to enact a nationwide interest rate cap on
credit cards.
   Under the measure, card issuers would be required to disclose
clearly their interest rates, fees, grace periods before interest
charges begin to accrue and the method of calculating interest
charges.
   In that way, Schumer and Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., the
key Senate sponsor, said consumers would be able to shop around for
the lowest interest rates because of competition.
   Michelle Meier, counsel for government affairs with Consumers
Union, said, ``We have waited anxiously for this bill to finally
become law and (Wednesday's) action takes us to within an inch of
that goal. All consumers, not just those in states which have
passed similar laws, will now get the information to fight and
switch.''
   Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American
Bankers Association, also praised the passage of the measure.
   ``The bill is a victory for both consumers and creditors who
will benefit from balanced disclosure legislation,'' said Ogilvie.
``This bill will make it easier for the 107 million credit card
holders in the U.S. to make informed choices about credit card
programs since significant card features will be disclosed earlier
_ at the time of application or solicitation, and in a uniform
manner. Under current law, creditors are not required to disclose
this information until the card is issued.''

   The 100th Congress, rather than recessing with
a bang, may go out with a whisper.
   Most sessions of Congress end with raucous, all-night
bill-passing sessions. But the 100th Congress is nearing an end to
its productive two-year session so quietly that many lawmakers may
not be around to see the gavel fall.
   It's an election year, and many senators and House members have
already slipped out of town to campaign for re-election back home.
Congress already has fallen nearly three weeks behind its original
adjournment target.
   Some members aren't anxious to come back at all.
   Senate leaders hinted Wednesday as to just how _ and just when _
the Congress might adjourn for the year.
   ``We won't have another vote this year,'' Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole of Kansas told startled reporters at a morning
meeting. He meant he didn't think the Senate would have any formal
roll call votes, but would pass remaining legislation by the
unanimous consent of those present.
   The Senate has been passing legislation all week without roll
call votes, a process that requires the presence of three senators:
the presiding officer, a single Democrat and a lone Republican.
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said later that Dole
had made ``a pretty accurate prediction.''
   Byrd explained in a telephone interview that although
legislation remains to be passed, including a major anti-drug bill,
``it's not the kind of thing senators have to come back for to take
roll call votes.''
   Two major pieces of legislation remain, the catchall anti-drug
bill already passed by the House and Senate in differing versions,
and a tax bill. If House-Senate negotiators can iron out
differences, the Senate could pass them both by Friday and quit for
the year.
   ``We ought to be able to finish the whole kit and caboodle by
the close of business Friday,'' Byrd said.
   Are any members complaining about still being here?
   ``My wife has complained,'' Byrd responded.
   In the House, members returned for roll call votes Wednesday,
but only after enjoying a five-day break while waiting for the
Senate to act on bills it already had passed.
   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California had his own
theory on why the election-year Congress was taking so long to
finish its business.
   ``Incumbent senators are enjoying having the excuse not to be
debating their opponents,'' Coelho said. ``How can the public
complain if you're here working on a drug bill?''
   Dole and Byrd are showing physical signs of wanting to call it
quits, or, in congressional parlance, adjourning ``sine die.'' In
English, that means without setting a date.
   Dole wore a campaign-style button on his label the other day
that proclaimed ``Free The 100th.''
   Byrd showed up the next day with his own button, warning: ``Sine
or Die.''

   If Nancy Reagan plans to continue her
years-long practice of borrowing high-priced designer fashions,
she's not saying.
   But her spokeswoman isn't ruling out the possibility that more
free fashions might be seen at White House functions.
   And President Reagan is jumping into the flap to defend his
wife, praising the first lady as a hard-working but unpaid
``government employee.''
   This evening, the president was scheduled to attend an elaborate
tribute to Mrs. Reagan, sponsored by Kiwanis International and
other organizations that have participated in her anti-drug abuse
campaign efforts.
   The celebration comes after a day in which Mrs. Reagan shunned
reporters who were attempting to speak with her about the designer
gowns lent her by leading fashion houses.
   On Wednesday, as she left the National Center for Therapeutic
Riding, a center devoted to helping the handicapped, Mrs. Reagan
only smiled slightly and continued walking as reporters attempted
to query her.
   The first lady's spokeswoman, Elaine Crispen, has acknowledged
that Mrs. Reagan ``broke her little promise'' made in 1982 to stop
accepting the items lent her by leading couturiers.
   Reagan denounced the reports, which first appeared in Time
Magazine over the weekend.
   ``I don't have anything to say about that ridiculous story,''
Reagan told reporters as he left the White House for a day of
campaigning in Ohio.
   And at a speech later in the day, Reagan came to his wife's
defense.
   He praised the first lady's anti-drug abuse campaign, and added:
``The government's got quite an employee there, with no salary.''
   White House counsel Fred Fielding informed the Office of
Government Ethics in 1982 that even though the Ethics in Government
Act of 1978 did not require Mrs. Reagan to report the borrowed
material, she would include the information on financial disclosure
forms.
   At that time, she also pledged to quit using borrowed items.
   However, Time quoted several designers over the weekend as
saying they have continued to lend Mrs. Reagan expensive clothes
since 1982. And neither the first lady nor the president has since
reported the items as gifts or loans on their financial disclosure
and tax forms.
   One Los Angeles designer, David Hayes, was quoted by Time as
saying he'd made some 60 to 80 made-to-order outfits available to
the first lady over the years. She returned more than half and kept
the others, he said.
   A spokeswoman for Hayes, who refused to identify herself, said
he was ``in conference'' on Wednesday and unable to take a phone
call.
   Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman disputed Hayes' account, contending
his numbers were ``extraordinarily high.''
   ``I haven't seen her wear a David Hayes in five years,'' Mrs.
Crispen said.
   Mrs. Crispen also took issue with Hayes' assertion that she
hasn't returned some of the dresses made especially for her. ``All
the items that were borrowed have been returned,'' Mrs. Crispen.
   The spokeswoman said she did not know what led the first lady to
break the promise she made in 1982 to report the borrowed gowns.
   ``I just don't know. She made her own rule ... She broke her own
rule. Perhaps because she was told it wasn't against the law. I
just don't know what her personal thinking was,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   The spokeswoman said she couldn't rule out a continuance of the
practice, however.
   ``I won't rule out that possibility _ that sometime, something
in the future might be borrowed,'' she added.

<HEAD>Cosmonaut Says John Denver Welcome On Soviet Craft, But Must Do
Useful Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American singer John Denver is welcome to fly
aboard a Soviet spacecraft, but the cosmonauts hope he will do
something besides bring his guitar and sing.
   Cosmonaut Alexander Alexandrov, who has made two space journeys
and spent a total of 310 days in orbit, said Wednesday that it is
the practice of the Soviet Union to fly ``representatives of many
countries'' on board the Mir space station.
   That, he said, would include someone from the United States,
including Denver.
   But Alexandrov, speaking through an interpreter, added: ``The
cosmonauts, of course, are more interested that if they fly with
someone, that their colleagues have tasks or experiments. Denver
deals with problems that are not totally connected with space or
with scientific or technological problems.''
   Denver, a recording artist and movie star, announced recently
that the Soviets have said he could fly aboard a Soviet craft and
spend time on the Mir space station if he would pay a fee of $10
million and undergo training.
   Alexandrov, teamed with Apollo astronaut Russell L. Schweickart
on a book promotion tour for the Association of Space Explorers,
said Soviet cosmonauts are interested in teaching children of the
world about the importance of space flight and ``how to preserve
our Earth.''
   This educational effort could be aided, he said, by flying
journalists and teachers, ``particularly teachers,'' into space.
   ``Denver could perhaps do the same thing,'' he said.
   Schweickart said that he has been told by the Soviets that the
$10 million fee required from Denver is not unique, but is a
standard charge that the Soviets have requested from all guest
cosmonauts.
   ``It's not like they are selling a ticket for money,'' said the
U.S. astronaut.
   Schweickart and Alexandrov said the Association of Space
Explorers is an organization open to any of the more than 200 men
and women from 25 countries who have flown in space. The current
membership is 72 from 17 countries, said Schweickart.
   Alexandrov said the group feels that the spacefaring nations of
the world should prepare a craft that will be constantly poised for
the launch of a rescue mission to recover astronauts or cosmonauts
stranded in space.
   ``You can have completely unexpected and catastrophic potential
crises in space,'' said Alexandrov. ``There may be a case that in
order to save a life you would have to rescue an astronaut before
three days went by.''
   During his first term in office, President Reagan asked the
Soviet Union to participate in developing space rescue techniques
that would involve transferring of astronauts and cosmonauts from
the orbiting spacecraft of one country to that of the other. But
the offer was rejected in 1985.
   Alexandrov, however, said the cosmonauts ``definitely agree''
that there should be rescue capabilities.
   ``There ought to be systems which are always ready to deal with
this, in the USSR and maybe other countries and the (United)
States,'' he said. ``This would allow us to go more calmly about
what we are doing.''
   The book promoted by the space explorers organization is
entitled ``The Home Planet'' and is a collection of photographs
taken in space on American and Soviet spacecraft. Along with the
pictures are quotations and excerpts from essays by the astronauts
and cosmonauts.
   ``This book is written for the children of the future, so
children might understand how to develop the science and technology
of the future and how to preserve the Earth,'' said Alexandrov, who
returned to Earth last December after 160 days on the Soviet space
station, Mir _ his second flight.
   Schweickart, who was lunar module pilot on the Apollo 9 mission
which tested equipment in Earth orbit as a rehearsal for the moon
landings, said a universal space rescue capability was discussed
two weeks ago at the Association of Space Explorers fourth annual
meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria.
   He said the group urged Reagan, NASA and the Congress last year
to include a rescue proposal as a topic of last spring's
Gorbachev-Reagan summit. The cosmonauts made a similar petition to
their government.
   But Schweickart said the rescue was not discussed. He said,
however, that the NASA authorization bill this year requires the
space agency to investigate cooperation with the Soviet Union of
such steps as establishing common docking capabilities and
frequency allocations that would lead to joint rescue capability.
   ``The most important aspect is commitment to the principle,''
said Alexandrov.

<HEAD>Advocacy Group Says Drug, Alcohol Use Up At Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost three-quarters of the mishaps recorded
at the nation's civilian nuclear reactors last year involved
personnel error, reflecting inadequate training, an advocacy group
associated with Ralph Nader says.
   The group, the Critical Mass Energy Project of Public Citizen,
said that of the 2,940 mishaps reported in 1987 to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission at the 107 licensed civilian nuclear
reactors, 2,197 involved personnel error and 591 were errors by
commission-licensed control room operators.
   ``The NRC has failed to satisfy its legal obligation to create
binding worker training regulations as mandated by Congress'' in
1982, Public Citizen charged.
   The group said the commission's adoption of a policy statement
endorsing the accreditation program of the Institute of Nuclear
Power Operations, an industry group, did not meet the law.
   But NRC spokeswoman Sue Gagner said, ``We think the policy
statement has worked well. The staff thinks the training programs
of the utilities are working well and are improving.''
   In addition to the personnel errors, Public Citizen also found
that reports to the NRC of drug and alcohol use among nuclear power
plant employees tripled last year, almost equalling the sum of all
reports in the previous 12 years.
   Through 1987, those incidents totaled 302, according to NRC
reports inspected by the project, while 150 were reported for 1987
alone.
   The group cited that finding as evidence for its contention that
training and qualification programs for nuclear plant personnel
were inadequate.
   It found that operator errors and errors by other employees are
growing as a percentage of plant mishaps, which the NRC calls
``licensee event reports.''
   Operator errors were 8 percent of 2,460 reports in 1984, or 2.2
per plant, and climbed steadily to 20 percent of 2,940 reports in
1987, or 5.6 per plant, the group found.
   Total errors by all plant personnel were 66 percent of all event
reports in 1984, or 19 per plant, and 74.7 percent in 1987, 21 per
plant.
   Both the Three Mile Island and the Chernobyl nuclear disasters
resulted from operator mistakes.
   Scott Peters of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a group
representing nuclear utilities and others, said, ``Once again
Public Citizen has nit-picked its way through the NRC files to
undermine public confidence in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.''
   Contrary to the thrust of Public Citizen's arguments, ``The
commission doesn't hesitate to shut down plants, levy heavy fines
and flunk operators that don't meet NRC standards,'' he said.

<HEAD>Teamsters Union Gives Members Final Say on Contracts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Teamsters Union, reacting to rank-and-file
repudiation of four of five of its biggest contracts this year, is
abolishing a decades-old practice requiring two-thirds ``no'' votes
to turn down tentative accords negotiated by its top leaders.
   The change in the Teamsters' constitution requiring a simple
majority _ any ``yes'' vote greater than 50 percent _ to approve
contracts covering some 1.6 million members was approved Wednesday
by the union's 18-member executive board meeting in Greenelefe,
Fla., union sources said.
   Teamster dissidents and sources within the union's hierarchy
said the decision was in response to a suit challenging a decision
by top Teamster officials in May to ignore a 63.5 percent
membership rejection of a contract covering some 200,000 interstate
truck divers and warehouse workers.
   The issue had been a major bone of contention in several
contracts and in Boston Teamster leader William McCarthy's victory
over Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis to succeed Jackie Presser as
the union's president after Presser's death in July.
   Duke Zeller, a Teamster spokesman reached at Greenelefe, would
not confirm or deny any changes in the union's constitution. Zeller
said McCarthy planned to meet with representatives from 750 locals
in Chicago later this month to ``talk about new directions in the
union.''
   However, sources at Greenelefe and at the union's headquarters
here confirmed that the Teamsters' board had voted to do away with
the two-thirds membership vote requirement for turning down
tentatively negotiated contracts.
   Other accords negotiated by Teamster leaders but turned down by
rank-and-file majorities this year included tentative agreements
signed with United Parcel Service, rejected by 53 percent of the
covered voting members, and Stroh Brewery Co., rejected by 54
percent.
   A proposed contract covering some 20,000 Teamsters who drive
auto transport trucks was renegotiated after it was rejected by 72
percent on a first ratification vote in July. Results of a second
ratification vote are due Friday.
   The only major contract approved by a majority of affected
Teamster members this year was with Anheuser-Busch Cos. covering
some 9,000 brewery workers.
   Ken Paff, an organizer for a 10,000-member dissident faction _
Teamsters for a Democratic Union _ called the union board's action
a major victory. Paff said Teamster leaders agreed to the change as
``part of an attempt to work out a settlement'' to a suit his group
filed last May in U.S. District Court here.
   ``We have been fighting for this steadily for 12 years,'' Paff
said. ``They called us nuts and screwballs, but we finally have
majority rule in this union.''
   Paff said the change had nothing to do with another suit _ by
the Justice Department _ seeking to wrest control of the Teamsters
from its top officers on grounds they are controlled by organized
crime.
   That suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan last June,
would empower a court-appointed trustee to run the union. McCarthy
and other Teamster leaders have denied that the union is controlled
by Mafia family heads, as the Justice Department's suit alleges.
   ``The Feds have shown no interest in this; it's not a
racketeering issue,'' Paff said of the former two-thirds rule,
adopted in the 1950s when the late Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa
moved to seize control on contract decisions from union locals.
   ``There's no law there has to be any membership vote on
approving contracts,'' Paff said.
   But the issue came to a boil in May when 63.5 percent of voting
truck drivers and warehouse workers under the nationwide Master
Freight Agreement returned ballots rejecting a new three-year
contract.
   Mathis, then acting as the union's president while Presser was
hospitalized with brain and lung cancer, declared the contract
ratified, saying the two-thirds requirement for rejecting it had
not been met.
   McCarthy and several other Teamster leaders had campaigned
against signing the accord and lobbied to reopen negotiations.
   Paff and officials within the union's hierarchy, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday the new language requiring
majority approval of new contacts instead of just 33 percent
approval covers both nationwide and local accords negotiated
separately by the Teamster's 750 locals.
   However, they said it also includes a provision reverting to the
two-thirds rule if less than 50 percent of the affected members
return ballots in any ratification vote.
   Meanwhile, Maurice Schurr, a Teamster vice president and the
union's top official in Philadelphia the past decade, retired
Wednesday from the 18-member executive board amid a McCarthy move
to oust him on charges of corruption.
   Schurr, 75, agreed to retire, effective Nov. 1, as the board was
preparing to vote on internal union charges brought against him
last month by McCarthy, Zeller said.
   In July, Schurr had sided with Mathis and against McCarthy, head
of the Teamsters' operations in New England for 20 years, in the
struggle for the union's leadership in the wake of Presser's death.
   Schurr was convicted in June 1984 on charges of taking illegal
payoffs from wholesale food employers with Teamster contracts in
the Philadelphia area and served a brief prison sentence in 1986.
   His conviction was repeatedly cited as an example of Teamster
corruption in the Justice Department's civil suit in June against
the union.

   A woman sentenced to 30 days in jail for tax

her cats and visit a park to feed squirrels and birds.
   Daisy Salsman, 50, began serving her sentence Tuesday at the

conspiracy and failure to file income tax returns.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy granted her request to be

squirrels and birds at a park near her home.
   Mrs. Salsman said in a letter to Conmy last week that she had

unsuccessful.
   ``While this sounds like a ridiculous request, the court finds
that it does have merit,'' Conmy wrote in an order signed Friday.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suspicious vans stacked with cages, 800 paws found
on a rubbish dump and thousands of missing felines point to
catnapping on a massive scale in England and Wales, a pet charity
says.
   The National Petwatch group in a report Wednesday warned owners
to keep cats indoors at night, saying increasing numbers of hunters
are seeking cat pelts for toys, fur coats and even food.
   ``In many parts of the country, cat theft has become an
organized crime on a massive scale,'' said Joan Warne, national
coordinator of the charity which monitors the loss and theft of
family pets.
   In ``Cat Stealing: A Special Report,'' the group said ``it would
be comforting to take refuge in the old adage `cats will wander,'
but we must face the real facts of the problem.''
   The group did not cite statistics on exactly how many cats have
been stolen. Police do not keep records on stolen cats and are not
required to record such cases, as they must with dogs, it said.
   But by monitoring advertisements for missing cats for five years
and other sources the group said it has uncovered ``alarming''
evidence, which it believes is ``only the tip of the iceberg.''
   Saying London and urban areas are among the worst-hit, the
report quoted excerpts from the Peckham Mercury newspaper in
southeast London as saying more than 100 cats were feared stolen in
the area.
   ``Many of the pets have vanished from roads where residents
report repeated sightings of a white van stacked with cages,'' the
paper said.
   A south London newspaper was quoted as describing a woman
chasing a man with a bag, and when he dropped it, out jumped three
cats including her own.
   National Petwatch reported that not only have 800 paws been
sighted on a rubbish dump in Manchester but skinned cat bodies have
been found, although it did not say where.
   Earlier this year, the group undertook a computer analysis of
2,027 advertisements for missing cats over a two-month period and
said the results pointed clearly to organized catnapping.
   It said 162 cats disappeared in the two months in rural
Hampshire, more than four times the national average.
   In some areas, more than 40 percent of the missing cats were
tabby, with dark stripes, or tortoise-shell with distinctive
markings, both fur colors popular for coats.
   Cat fur is cheap to obtain and has become more sought after in
the fur trade following restrictions on seal and other endangered
animals' fur, the report said.
   ``Lots of 10,000 domestic cat pelts regularly come under the
hammer at German fur auctions,'' the group said, adding that
Scandinavia, Australia and Britain are known in trade circles as
good suppliers.
   An unidentified spokeswoman for the Fur Trade Association,
interviewed on Independent Television, denied that cat pelts used
in the fur trade were stolen.
   ``There is really no reason to go out and steal pets because
frankly you wouldn't make any money anyway,'' she said, adding that
pelts cost only about $1.75 each and are obtained legally from
veterinarians. ``And there is no demand, either.''
   But the report argued that ``foreign dealers require so many
that they are willing to buy them in tens of thousands on a `no
questions asked' basis.''
   The report added that cat pelts are sold in Germany pharmacies
as a cure for arthritis, that some cats are stolen as training bait
for fighting hares and dogs, and that others are apparently killed
for food.

   Carrie Munson beat heroin addiction to succeed
as a radio broadcaster and social worker. Now that the 62-year-old
has terminal cancer, she plans to beat death, too, by attending her
own funeral next week.
   The music, she says, will be ``I Did It My Way.'' And she plans
to enjoy it.
   ``As long as I can remember, I have always wanted to know when I
was going to die so I could put things in order,'' the Milwaukee
woman said Wednesday. ``I want to watch the peoples' expressions. I
want to see the way they react.''
   Munson, who has pancreatic cancer and has been told she does not
have long to live, sent invitations to her ``friends, associates
and enemies'' and three sons for the Oct. 29 service. Her sons plan
to attend.
   Munson is writing an autobiography called ``Bury Me in My Cap
and Gown,'' and said the funeral would be an appropriate way to end
her life's story.
   ``I'll get it all embedded in my mind and when I get home I'll
just write up that final chapter,'' she said.
   The Rev. R. L. Lathan, pastor of the New Hope Baptist Church,
has agreed to conduct the service.
   ``This is the first time I've had this kind of request,'' Lathan
said. ``It's very, very strange and unusual. She wanted to be at
her own funeral and she wanted to be alive.''
   For Munson, who says she spent more than 20 years as a drug
addict until she returned to school in her 40s, death is not
something to fear.
   ``I have a message for all these young drug addicts out there,
and I have a message for the cancer patients,'' she said. ``The
message is why be afraid? We've all got to die.''
   Although Munson said her cancer is painful, she refuses to let
it disturb her ``because I'm not the type to give in.''
   Munson, born in Mississippi, had only a fourth-grade education
until she returned to school decades later. She said she is strong
because she has been on her own all her life.
   ``My mother died when I was 3 and I was the youngest of six,''
she said. ``If I knew one thing, it was that I was not going to be
a sharecropper.''
   She saved enough money from picking cotton to buy a bus ticket
to St. Louis and arrived ``with nothing but what was on my back and
some high-heeled shoes that had the heels cut off.''
   Once in St. Louis, Munson scraped together enough money to get
to Chicago, where she said she was turned on to heroin by an
acquaintance.
   That, she said, began an involvement with drugs that led to
prison terms for crimes committed to get the drugs, including
theft, prostitution and forgery.
   ``It took me 24 or 25 years to get off that darn stuff,'' she
said, ``I said to myself, `Either crawl out of the gutter and die
or get off your butt and do something.'''
   Munson said she decided to apply to the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and although she was not qualified, ``I had so
much enthusiasm they let me in.''
   Since graduating with a degree in mass communications and
journalism in 1975, Munson has worked as the host of a jazz show at
a radio station and most recently as a social worker with Wisconsin
Correctional Services, where she has helped clients find jobs.
   Munson said she would wear her college cap and gown at the
funeral service, ``which I am very proud of.''
   ``And when I die,'' she said, ``somebody better put it on me.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told dozens
of Israeli Arab villagers that his hardline Likud bloc offers Arabs
``real rights'' but will fight against those who support the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In a campaign speech in this northern village Wednesday, Shamir
also urged about 250 Arab listeners to ``ask your brothers to stop
terrorism and start negotiations.''
   The right-wing leader referred to the 10-month-old Palestinian
rebellion against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, during which 301 Arabs and six Israelis have died.
   The uprising in the occupied territories are a key campaign
issue in the Nov. 1 general elections.
   Polls show that Likud's principal rival, the left-leaning Labor
Party, may lose half of its Israeli Arab support because many Arabs
hold Labor's No. 2 man, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, responsible
for the harsh crackdown on the Palestinian uprising.
   Likud and Labor, headed by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, are
now running neck-to-neck, and both compete for crucial Arab support.
   On Monday, Peres took his campaign to the Israeli Arab town of
Shfaram but encountered a frosty reception as he told the Arabs
they should decide the battle between the two major parties and not
waste their votes on smaller parties.
   Shamir, however, dismissed the importance of the Arab vote. ``I
don't think the Arab vote will be the deciding vote,'' he told
reporters.
   But speaking in Tamra, Shamir told Arab villagers:
   ``What we offer is real rights. The Likud will be here for both
Jews and Arabs as well.''
   Last year, Israeli Arabs staged several general strikes to
demand better schools and municipal services and protest
bureaucracy in solving housing problems.
   Israeli leaders, among them Shamir, have expressed concern that
Palestinian uprising may spread to the Arab sector in Israel.
   ``We are searching for peace,'' Shamir said. ``We're going to
live together as two peoples. Ask your brothers to stop terrorism
and start negotiations ... But to those Arabs who want to support
the PLO, we will say go your way. As much as we want peace, we know
how to fight those who threaten us.''
   Ismael Salaama, an Arab from the village of Turam, stood in the
crowd featuring a Likud campaign hat and carrying a party campaign
pamphlet.
   ``I'm listening to Likud and Labor, then I will decide,'' he
said. ``When I go to a Labor rally and there are hats, I wear those
hats, too.''
   About 330,000 of Israel's 800,000 Arabs are eligible to vote
this year, and could control 14 seats in the 120-member Knesset, or
parliament. In the 1984 general elections, one in four Arabs voted
Labor. This year, analysts say Labor may lose 1.5 seats in the Arab
sector.
   According to recent Labor polls cited in the Jerusalem Post, the
Communist Party may gain one seat in the Arab sector this year,
bringing its total to five.
   The Communists are fiercely competing for the Arab vote against
the pro-PLO Progressive List for Peace. The group is expected to
maintain its strength with two seats.
   Six other parties, including Likud, would share the remaining
seats in the Arab sector, an udentified Labor official told the
newspaper.

<HEAD>Friend Who Allegedly Offered Suicide Help Faces Murder Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old man who a witness said
helped a friend commit suicide by pulling the trigger of a shotgun
placed in the victim's mouth has been charged with murder.
   Dennis C. Harwood Jr. was arraigned Tuesday in District Court in
the Oct. 6 death of Jack Main Jr. Prosecutors have not specified
the degree of murder.
   Main, 24, died in the apartment he shared with Harwood and Dean
Myers, 19. While police have not provided details of the shooting,
Myers said that after drinking heavily, Main put the barrel of a
20-gauge shotgun in his mouth.
   Harwood offered to pull the trigger, Myers told The Grand Rapids
Press on Tuesday.
   ``I think Denny thinks he was doing the right thing at the
time,'' Myers said. ``But now I think he realizes he was wrong.''
   However, one of the suspect's sisters said Harwood told his
family he was trying to pull the gun away from Main when it
discharged.
   ``He tried to stop him,'' Patty Musser said. ``He's not a
murderer.''
   Myers described sitting on a bed between the two men with the
barrel of the shotgun in Main's mouth and Harwood's finger on the
trigger, the gun suspended like a bridge above his lap.
   Harwood said, ``Let me do it,'' and Main answered, ``Go ahead,''
according to Myers. ``That was the last thing that was said.
   ``None of us said a word for about 30 seconds. It was all quiet
until the gun went off,'' he said.
   Main died instantly.
   ``On the day, we were quite sure it was not a suicide,'' Police
Chief Gene Koetje said. ``But yet we were not sure about the degree
of involvement. We weren't sure we were going to have an actual
murder.''
   Police on Monday arrested Harwood, who had known Main since they
were classmates in elementary school. He was held in the Barry
County Jail on a $100,000 bond. Police said Myers is not considered
a suspect in the case.
   Koetje said police knew Main had been threatening suicide. ``It
was just depression. Things just weren't going well. He'd been
having some personal problems,'' the chief said.
   Main's wife had recently left him, taking their year-old
daughter with her, according to relatives. Myers said Main had
argued with a girlfriend just before the shooting.

   Howard Palmbach had two questions after
finding a 300-pound black bear and her four cubs in his walnut tree.
   ``Where did they come from and how did they get here?'' asked
Palmbach, 68.
   Palmbach and his wife, Phyllis, had just finished breakfast
Wednesday when their dog barked and they discovered the bears
napping in the tree.
   ``All five were just dozing there in the tree _ 15 feet from the
house,'' Mrs. Palmbach said. ``You could almost reach them from our
window.''
   Conservation wardens spent the morning trying to get the animals
out of the tree. They finally used tranquilizer darts and a long
pole to capture the mother bear and three of the cubs. The other
got away but was caught later in a cornfield.
   Authorities blocked off part of U.S. 10 for several hours as
they captured the bears.
   The Palmbach home is across the highway from Chaska Golf Course,
four miles west of Appleton in eastern Wisconsin.
   The captured bears were taken to Green Bay to be weighed before
being released in Marinette County in northeastern Wisconsin.

   The North Carolina Yam Commission is
considering changing its name after learning the state produces no
yams.
   North Carolina is the nation's top producer of sweet potatoes,
but the yam is grown only in tropical climates, primarily in
Africa, said Billy Yeargin, the commission's executive director.
   ``That bothers us a great deal,'' said Yeargin, who is worried
about consumer confusion.
   Sweet potatoes are smaller than yams, which grow up to 100
pounds. When cooked, the texture and taste of sweet potatoes and
yams are similar but yams are off-white while sweet potatoes are
orange.
   Despite the ``loss'' of the yam, Yeargin predicted a growing
demand for sweet potatoes as consumers become more health-conscious
and turn to more nutritious foods.
   ``I think the sweet potato has a good future,'' he said.

<HEAD>Suriname Strongman Mistakenly Detained By Brazilian Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of the Suriname Army was
arrested and later released after Brazilian police confused him and
seven heavily armed companions with criminals, authorities said
today.
   In Paramaribo, Suriname Vice President Henck Arron denounced
Wednesday's arrest of Cmdr. Desi Bouterse over state television.
   Arron termed the detention of the Suriname strongman in this
industrial city as a ``sad incident,'' especially in light of
Brazil's recent grant of a $3 million credit line to Suriname for
food and raw materials.
   Arron said Bouterse, 43, was vacationing in Brazil and tried to
identify himself to officers at a shopping center but instead was
handcuffed and taken to the police headquarters.
   Globo, Brazil's largest television network, quoted Sao Paulo
police as saying officers did not understand what any of the
heavily armed group said.
   Brazilians speak Portuguese, while Dutch is spoken in Suriname.
   Suriname, a former Dutch colony in northeastern South America,
borders Brazil, Guyana and French Guiana.
   Globo said the group was released after phone calls to Brazil's
Foreign Ministry and diplomats at Suriname's Embassy in Brasilia,
the capital. No charges were filed, Globo said.
   In Suriname, Arron said Suriname Foreign Minister Edwin Sedoc
lodged a formal complaint with Brazilian Charge d'Affaires Henry
Jenne, who was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and asked for an
explanation.
   Radio broadcasts quoted Luiz Antonio Fleury, head of Sao Paulo's
state security, as apologizing to Bouterse over the incident.
   Bouterse and a band of army sergeants overthrew Arron's civilian
government in 1980 when Arron was prime minister.
   Bouterse named himself army commander and headed a military
government until national elections were held last February, in
which Ramsewak Shankar was elected president and Arron vice
president.
   Although Bouterse officially transferred power to the civilian
government, he retains control of the country's military, whose
blessing is required on all major government decisions.
   Last May, Bouterse was vacationing in Brazil when his companion,
Lt. Guno Mahaden, who as a sergeant had participated in the 1980
coup, drowned while swimming at a beach in Rio de Janeiro.

   An unfounded rumor about George Bush was enough
to trigger a brief plunge in a still-unstable stock market on the
anniversary of the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 22.58 points
Wednesday from a post-crash high of 2159.85, only a hint of the
508-point drop on Oct. 19, 1987, when panic wiped out half a
trillion dollars of stock wealth.
   Wednesday's late drop was the biggest excitement on a low-key
crash anniversary day that Wall Street employees marked by trading
stocks, bonds and horror stories and raising an occasional glass of
champagne.
   The rumor was that The Washington Post would publish a story
potentially damaging to the Republican presidential candidate. The
Post denied having or planning any such story.
   But traders who had made profits in the market's recent rise
sold on a hint of problems with the vice president, who is leading
Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis in most polls.

   When Vera Beaudin learned that her husband-to-be
was a Kurd, her response was, ``What's that?''
   Today, from a Brooklyn brownstone, Vera Beaudin Saeedpour runs
one the few programs in the world devoted to the history and
culture of the Kurds, one of the largest ethnic minorities without
its own country.
   About 20 million Kurds live in a mountainous, oil-rich region
that includes Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Syria and Soviet Armenia. The
Kurds, a largely Islamic group who speak an Indo-European language
similar to Persian, have been fighting for an independent Kurdistan
on and off for much of this century.
   Kurds have long claimed they are discriminated against and often
persecuted, particularly in Turkey and Iraq. In September, the U.S.
Senate concluded that Iraq had killed hundreds, possibly thousands,
of Kurds in poison gas attacks against Kurdish rebels.
   Saeedpour, 58, says she became fascinated with her husband's
culture because, as a Jew, the Kurdish plight reminded her of the
Holocaust and the years before Israel was established, when Jews
had no homeland.
   ``When I was a kid, I thought well, how did all those people die
and nobody did anything? Well, the same thing is happening to the
Kurds.''
   So when her husband died in 1981, Saeedpour left her position at
a New York real estate company to establish the Kurdish Program,
which she runs single-handedly from the first floor of her home.
   It has grown into a tiny institute, the floors covered with _
what else? _ Kurdish woven rugs, and the walls bearing huge
photographs of Kurds accompanied by quotes from Kurdish poetry.
Each year, hundreds of scholars from around the world use her
library _ 1,000 volumes about the Kurds written in tongues ranging
from Swedish to Persian.
   A guest book lists recent visitors from Germany, England, Texas,
and Alaska; a Kurdish guerilla leader, Jamal Talabani; journalists;
and plenty of New Yorkers _ some Kurdish, others merely curious.
   ``I'm dealing with the whole world from this brownstone,'' said
Saeedpour. ``I'm like an old lady holding fast to a balloon that's
going up into the sky.''
   Indeed, the 5-foot-tall dynamo has her fingers in a dozen pies.
She has organized a troupe to perform Kurdish folk dances. She
publishes a semi-annual journal called The Kurdish Times and dreams
of opening a shop of Kurdish crafts.
   Saeedpour even prints her own mailing labels _ 1,500 of them _
on a home computer.
   Strewn about her office are clippings of her letters to the
editor about the Kurdish plight, published in The New York Times,
The Wall Street Journal and other papers.
   The phone never stops ringing. It could be a scholar wanting to
use the library, a Kurd seeking help with an immigration problem,
or one of her children. She has five.
   ``I overdo everything,'' she said.
   Against one wall stand four mannequins dressed in colorful
layers of traditional Kurdish clothes _ pantaloons, a brocade
jacket, cummerbund, and a large fringed scarf piled atop the head.
There are also 18th- and 19th-century maps that identify a large
country called Kurdistan just east of Algezir _ now Syria.
   ``Sometimes a Kurd will send me something in a plain brown
wrapper from someplace really remote _ a book from Soviet Armenia
or something with an inscription in Kurdish,'' she said. ``It's
really very moving.''
   Saeedpour does not accept funding from any government agency or
even from Kurdish political parties. The program's $35,000 annual
budget is supported by individual contributions.
   But she said governments that are unhappy about her work imagine
otherwise. Saeedpour said an Iraqi magazine called her a ``Zionist
in the pay of the CIA,'' while the Turkish media claims she is
funded by Greece and Armenians.
   ``I wish it were true,'' she said. ``Maybe they'd fix my
ceiling.''

   Rodeo Drive isn't what it used to
be, lamented an art gallery proprietor who stood helplessly as a
judge declared his $200,000 Rolls-Royce a public nuisance for
hogging a parking spot on the glitzy street.
   ``I just wanted to put glitter and glamor back on the street,''
David Spellerberg Wednesday after Superior Court Judge Edward
Kakita issued a preliminary injuction barring him from parking the
1954 Rolls on Rodeo Drive for more than an hour at a time in front
of his business.
   Spellerberg had infuriated city officials by flaunting parking
regulations, in effect using the vintage auto as a promotion for
his business.
   According to the order, Spellerberg must move the car at least
500 feet after it is parked an hour in the spot. The order also
prohibits him from blocking the sidewalk or using the sidewalk for
any commercial advertisements or promotions.
   Five attorneys representing the city persuaded Kakita to issue
the injunction.
   ``Rodeo Drive just isn't what it used to be,'' Spellerberg said
after the 15 minute hearing. ``This is the first time a Rolls-Royce
has been declared a public nuisance. Only in Beverly Hills would
this happen.''
   Spellerberg's chauffeur has parked the dark blue car in the
one-hour spot in front of his National Heritage Gallery of Fine Art
for the past seven months.His driver would pump the meter with $15
in quarters each day.
   ``We're paying $20,000 a month in rent and I can't even park my
own car in front of my own gallery,'' Spellerberg said.
   Spellerberg said he bought the Rolls after noticing tourists
walking down Rodeo Drive, known for its posh shops and celebrity
clientele, were frequently heard asking, ``Is that all there is?''
   Since parking the Rolls in front of the gallery, he said, an
estimated 20,000 tourists have posed for snapshots in front of the
luxury car. He blames the heavy-handed treatment by the city on
jealous business owners nearby.
   Spellerberg said he isn't giving up his fight, but he won't
disclose his next move.
   ``The city hasn't had any sense of humor in this,'' Spellerberg
said. ``They had five attorneys in there this morning. I want to
know what the taxpayers have to say about that.''

<BYLINE>Ruler Warns Against Attempts To Discredit Army
^By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military ruler has warned the
country's newly formed political parties against attempts to
discredit or sow dissension within the army.
   Since taking power in a Sept. 18 coup, Saw Maung has crushed
pro-democracy street demonstrations but allowed formation of
opposition political parties to contest a general election he has
promised to hold soon. No date has been set for the balloting.
   ``Taking advantage of permission for party organizations, some
parties are indulging in efforts to create misunderstanding between
the army and the public, and also create dissension within the
army,'' Saw Maung said Wednesday in a broadcast over state-run
Radio Rangoon.
   ``The army is not participating in the elections but it is
concerned only with the holding of a free and fair general
election,'' he said.
   ``Political parties are ... warned not to incite, preach, write,
or spread rumors aimed at creating dissension among the military.
Violations of these warnings will be dealt with effectively,'' he
said.
   The parties have not publicly made the statements suggested by
Saw Maung. But some opposition figures have said they do not trust
the administration to conduct fair elections, partly because they
say the National Unity Party enjoys the backing of the government
and the army.
   The party, earlier called the Burma Socialist Program Party, had
ruled the country with an iron fist for 26 years as the sole legal
party before its recent disbandment.
   The radio said two more parties registered Wednesday, bringing
the total number of parties to 24.
   The All Burma National Youth League registered along with the
Mon National Democratic Front, the fourth ethnic minority-based
party. In the remote countryside, guerrillas of a number of ethnic
minorities have been fighting the government for four decades.
   Radio Rangoon said U.S. Ambassador Burton Levin called on the
elections commission Wednesday and met with its chairman, Ba Htay,
to discuss the promised general election. No details were given in
the broadcast.
   Also, Radio Rangoon said Saw Maung's administration enacted a
law Wednesday changing the country's name from the Socialist
Republic of the Union of Burma to Union of Burma.
   Union of Burma was used beginning with the constitution of 1947,
a year before Burmese independence. It was changed after Gen. Ne
Win mounted the 1962 coup and began a quarter century of repression
and rigid socialist economic policies. Ne Win resigned July 23, and
two other leaders followed before Saw Maung's coup, which many
diplomats believe was engineered by Ne Win.
   The country's name had already been changed on some recent
government press releases, apparently as part of an effort to
convince the public that the ruinous policies of the past were
being shelved.
   The broadcast also said the name ``president,'' or head of
state, is to be replaced by ``the chairman of the State Law and
Order Restoration Council'' _ a title now held by Saw Maung. Saw
Maung already is prime minister, defense and foreign minister.

<HEAD>Government Bans On TV, Radio Interviews With IRA, Others Begin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government ban went into effect today on British
television and radio interviews with the Irish Republican Army and
10 nationalist and Protestant groups involved in Northern Ireland's
sectarian conflict.
   News reports today indicated further restrictions are in the
offing to try to curb the recent rise in guerrilla activity.
   Sinn Fein, the outlawed IRA's legal political wing, compared the
ban announced Wednesday by the government with Soviet bloc
censorship. In addition to the IRA, the ban includes Sinn Fein and
four Protestant groups.
   IRA guerrillas seek to end British rule in predominantly
Protestant Northern Ireland and unite it with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland under socialist rule. Most Protestants oppose
uniting with the Republic.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member responsible for
law and order and broadcasting among other matters, on Wednesday
told the House of Commons:
   ``The government has decided that the time has now come to deny
this easy platform to those who use it to propagate terrorism.''
   Junior Home Office minister of state Timothy Renton explained
Wednesday night that ``the whole aim of this (ban)... is to remove
that extra weapon _ the ability to go on television immediately
afterwards to speak in justification of an explosion or a bomb.''
   Appearances by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and other Irish
nationalist leaders on British television in recent years have
enraged many viewers.
   Adams is a member of the British House of Commons. But in
accordance with long-standing IRA practice, he has never taken his
seat since first being elected for west Belfast in 1983.
   The Republic of Ireland has banned TV and radio interviews with
the IRA, Sinn Fein and other groups since the mid-1970s.
   Sinn Fein seeks to convince mainland Britain that British
security forces in Northern Ireland cannot curb the sectarian and
political violence there, and that British forces should be
withdrawn.
   The chairman of the British Broadcasting Corp., Marmaduke
Hussey, and its director-general, Michael Checkland, said in a
joint statement Wednesday night that the ban sets a damaging
precedent.
   Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the socialist opposition Labor
Party, said the ban was ``trivial, worthless and almost certainly
counterproductive.''
   The ban affects only British TV and radio networks. It does not
affect interviews by foreign TV and radio networks broadcasting to
audiences outside Britain or interviews by newspapers and other
print media, either British or foreign.
   The seven Irish nationalist groups covered by the ban are the
Provisional and Official wings of the IRA; Sinn Fein; the Irish
National Liberation Army, an outlawed splinter group from the IRA;
Cumann Na Mban, the IRA's women's movement; Na Fianna Eireann, the
IRA's youth section; and the Republican Socialist Group Saor Eire.
   The four Protestant groups covered by the ban are the legal
paramilitary Ulster Defense Association; the outlawed Ulster
Freedom Fighters, who are reportedly the UDA's military arm; the
outlawed Red Hand Commandos; and the outlawed Ulster Volunteer
Force.
   Hurd said the ban would not apply to election campaigns and the
broadcasting of Parliament.
   David Nicholas, editor and chief executive of commercial
television's Independent Television News, said he feared the ban
might lead to further reporting restrictions.
   The London newspaper The Guardian quoted unnamed government
sources as saying the ban is the start of a series of initiatives.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said measures
being considered include removal of a suspect's legal right of
silence, so that refusal to cooperate with police can be brought to
the attention of the courts; exclusion from elections of candidates
who refuse to renounce violence; and changes to allow guerrillas to
be convicted of IRA membership on the evidence of a single police
officer.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels attacked
army-defended coffee plantations and a prison in Usulutan province,
killing two soldiers and wounding eight others, officials said.
   The attacks early Wednesday outside Santa de Maria, 70 miles
east of San Salvador, marked the guerrilla army's eighth
anniversary.
   The fighting began hours after two car bomb explosions wounded
six civilians in an affluent San Salvador neighborhood. Rebels were
presumed responsible for the bombings.
   Rebel radio on Wednesday said air force planes and helicopters
attacked Torola, in eastern Morazan province, with bombs, rockets
and machine guns on Monday. It said a rocket hit the town church
with ``numerous'' people inside, leaving three ``gravely wounded.''
   An air force spokesman said no officer was available to comment
on the allegation.
   The main targets of the pre-dawn Santa de Maria attack included
three plantations surrounding the town, their processing plants,
the local prison and an electricity transmission plant.
   Prudencio Llach, owner of one of the plantations, is
father-in-law of Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova and
also father-in-law of rightist presidential candidate Alfredo
Cristiani.
   About 50 criminals were reported freed in the prison attack.
Military officials said the electric plant was slightly damaged,
while guerrillas claimed it was destroyed.
   Rebels formed a unified command, the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front known as FMLN, in October 1980. The anniversary is
celebrated thoughout October.
   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said the attacks were
part of an operation called, ``With the people we advance toward
victory on the eighth anniversary of the FMLN.''
   Military officers estimate there are 6,000 to 7,000 full-time
guerrillas and perhaps twice as many men and women who serve
part-time in the rebel militia. There are 55,000 men in the armed
forces of the U.S.-backed government.

   A judge in Czechoslovakia abruptly
cleared a courtroom after a Roman Catholic activist recited a
prayer during a hearing for four people arrested for taking part in
a demonstration for religious freedom, a news agency said.
   The appeals court in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, upheld the
sentences of the four activists, the Austrian Catholic news agency
Kathpress said Wednesday.
   In the original trial, activists Bernadetta Ostrubova, Martin
Pavlicko, Stanislav Kopcek and Ludmilla Heribanova had been
sentenced to two months imprisonment and fines of $200 for taking
part in the March 25 demonstration.
   Proceedings against another activist, Miroslav Toth, were
adjourned, Kathpress said without giving other details.
   A large number of supporters assembled in and around
Bratislava's Palace of Justice but only about ten people were
allowed to attend the hearing, Kathpress said.
   At the start of proceedings, the judge reportedly said it was
prohibited to pray in the courtroom.
   According to Kathpress, Ms. Ostrubova, at the end of
proceedings, was asked whether she wanted to make a final
statement. She reportedly responded with the Lord's Prayer.
   Those in the courtroom were taken aback, Kathpress quoted an
eyewitness as saying, and the judge ordered the premises cleared.
   As she left the courtoom, Ms. Ostrubova was loudly cheered by
her supporters and given flowers.
   Kathpress said several activists were held at police
headquarters for several hours to prevent them from attending the
court session.

<HEAD>Kennedy Urges More Press Responsibility; Cites Quayle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy told newspaper editors the
news media have been unfair to vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle, and said coverage of the campaign has turned it into an
exercise in style over substance.
   ``It (the coverage) has not been a fair characterization of
him,'' the Massachusetts Democrat said of the Republican Senator
from Indiana during a speech at the conclusion of the Associated
Press Managing Editors convention.
   ``Most of his colleagues would say he does a lot better in give
and take in the Senate. I've worked with him and he does a better
job on the (Senate) floor.''
   Kennedy said Wednesday he was impressed with Quayle when they
co-sponsored the Jobs Training Partnership Act. He also called
Quayle a ``forceful, vigorous'' defender of the conservative issues
he espouses.
   Though Kennedy began on a light note, telling the editors ``it's
not often I get to address a group whose standing in the polls is
lower than Congress,'' he quickly became serious.
   He decried the 1988 presidential campaign, saying that the press
and politics have become dangerously intertwined.
   ``Substance has been overwhelmed by image,'' he said. ``Both
sides are guilty of reducing important events to `spin' control.''
   Kennedy said Republican presidential nominee George Bush's trip
to Boston Harbor to demonstrate his interest in the environment and
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis' ride in an Army
tank were typical of the flashy but trivial methods the candidates
have used to show their stand on the issues.
   ``Campaigning has become a meat market,'' said Kennedy. ``What
coverage there is comes in the form of labels. Negative campaigning
is drowning out positive campaigning.''
   Kennedy urged editors to try and stem the ``widening gap''
between issues and candidates by focusing more on real events and
avoiding ``horse-race'' style journalism.
   Also at the convention, a panel of three journalists urged
editors to make more of a commitment to hiring minority reporters
and editors, who they said comprise only 7 percent of working
American journalists.
   Norma Sosa, of the Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times, called
the outlook for minority journalists ``bleak'' and encouraged
editors to attend minority journalist job fairs, recruit at
colleges and spend more time in newsroom minority development.
   William Hawkins, editor of the Durham (N.C.) Morning Herald and
The Durham Sun, urged editors to improve their treatment of
minority journalists once they are hired since many tend to leave
journalism after a few years.
   Also Wednesday, editors witnessed a debate between the principal
involved in a historic U.S. Supreme Court decision this year
backing school administrators in censoring student publications.
   Robert Reynolds, principal of Hazelwood East High School in St.
Louis said he censored articles in the school paper as a way to
prevent inaccuracies, guard privacy and maintain control of
students.
   Reynolds said the support he has received from educators and
parents around the country since the case began five years ago
``seems to send a clear message that many people think we have lost
control of their schools.''
   ``I do not believe I have the right to trample on student
rights,'' said Reynolds. ``But what we have done is to require
educators to exercise their judgment. ... Our interest should be
bringing a clarification of the purpose of student expression.''
   Reynolds debated David Hawpe, editor of The Courier-Journal of
Louisville, Ky.
   Hawpe, who has been with The Courier-Journal for 18 years and
was introduced as the editor of his elementary, high school and
college newspapers, said any censorship of student newspapers
threatens the First Amendment.
   ``It's a serious assault on the conventional wisdom once
embraced by the courts,'' Hawpe said. ``It gave school officials
breathtaking powers over school journalists.''
   The convention also included a discussion of media ethics with
editors and Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn and Philadelphia Mayor W.
Wilson Goode.
   The moderator, Michael Josephson, had questioned all the
panelists when he asked Flynn a complicated question about a
situation involving a reporter deciding whether to go off the
record.
   ``I thought I was just here to give greetings from the city of
Boston,'' replied Flynn, who later joined in the debate.

   A principal whose censorship of the high school
newspaper was upheld in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling told
newspaper editors he vetoed sensitive articles to prevent
inaccuracies, guard privacy and maintain control of students.
   Robert Reynolds, principal of Hazelwood East High School in St.
Louis, made his remarks Wednesday during a debate with David Hawpe,
editor of The (Louisville, Ky.) Courier-Journal, at the Associated
Press Managing Editors convention.
   Reynolds said the support he has received from educators and
parents around the country since the case began five years ago
``seems to send a clear message that many people think we have lost
control of their schools.''
   ``I do not believe I have the right to trample on student
rights,'' said Reynolds. ``But what we have done is to require
educators to exercise their judgment. ... Our interest should be
bringing a clarification of the purpose of student expression.''
   The Supreme Court ruled in January that Reynolds did not violate
students' free speech rights by ordering two pages containing
articles on teen pregnancy and divorce deleted from an issue of a
student-produced newspaper five years ago.
   Hawpe, who has been with The Courier-Journal 18 years and was
introduced as the editor of his elementary, high school and college
newspapers, said any censorship of student newspapers threatens the
First Amendment.
   ``It's a serious assault on the conventional wisdom once
embraced by the courts,'' Hawpe said. ``It gave school officials
breathtaking powers over school journalists.''
   Hawpe compared the ruling to state censorship.
   ``We ought to be teaching children about the diversity of
ideas,'' he said. ``But we aren't teaching them. We should teach
them that the Constitution is a living document, not a piece of
parchment.''
   Reynolds said he decided to delete the material because of
inaccuracies in the articles and his belief that they violated the
privacy of those mentioned in the stories.
   ``When it's Friday the 13th and Ferris Bueller's the editor of
your school newspaper, your luck runs out,'' said Reynolds. ``It
becomes more than just a case of students' rights alone. ...
Excellence in school journalism will survive.''

   A dozen lawmakers want assurances from
President Reagan that problem-plagued U.S. weapons plants are being
operated safely before reactors now shut down are restarted.
   ``Restoration of safe operations and reliable production are
essential to the defense and security of our nation,'' the 12
congressmen said in a letter to Reagan released Wednesday.
   The Energy Department shut the only active weapons reactor at
the Savannah River plant near Aiken, S.C., in August after the
plant operator, Du Pont Co., ignored an unexplained power surge
while restarting the reactor.
   ``Unless we solve the current problems at U.S. defense
production facilities like Savannah River, we will provide the
ultimate unilateral concession _ the unilateral disarming of our
nuclear deterrent,'' said Rep. Bill Clinger, R-Pa., one of the
lawmakers.

   The Loyal Order of Moose has placed a $50,000
deposit on its $1 million commitment to aid the restoration of the
fire-ravaged Yellowstone National Park.
   Contributions from the Moose will be used to help fund a $25
million National Park Service plan to rehabilitate damaged
facilities and restore 1,640 miles of man-made barriers used to
combat the blazes, Dennis Galvin, deputy park service director,
said Wednesday.
   Almost half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres were engulfed by
a series of eight fires which swept though the 100-year-old park
from June through September.
   The century-old Moose, headquartered in Mooseheart, Ill., plans
to raise funds through donations from it's lodges in 2,300
communities nationwide, said Paul J. O'Hollaren, director general
of the 1.8 million-member fraternity.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito, bedridden for a month with an
intestinal hemorrhage, discharged more blood today, and the palace
said his kidney and other organ functions were deteriorating.
   The world's oldest living monarch coughed up blood Wednesday for
the first time in a month and discharged more from his bowels
shortly after. Palace spokesman Kenji Maeda reported fresh bleeding
from the bowels today and said the pace of the discharges was
quickening.
   Hirohito vomited a large quantity of blood Sept. 19 and has
received almost daily transfusions totaling more than 21 pints
since then.
   Maeda said the copious transfusions were producing a rapid
heartbeat and admitted without elaboration that they were harming
Hirohito's kidney functions.
   The emperor's daughter, Atsuko Ikeda, told reporters Wednesday
that the 87-year-old emperor barely responded during a five-minute
visit and coughed repeatedly.
   Meanwhile, Crown Princess Michiko, wife of Crown Prince Akihito,
scaled down celebrations for her 54th birthday today out of
deference to her ailing father-in-law.
   Michiko canceled a traditional birthday news conference and
planned a quiet gathering with members of the imperial family, a
palace official said. She and Akihito made their daily visit to
Hirohito's bedside this morning.

<HEAD>North Korea Proposes New Korea With Its Rival South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea has proposed creating a new
non-aligned Korean nation in which the communist north and its
enemy, the capitalist south, would peacefully co-exist.
   North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kang Sok Ju, told the
43rd General Assembly that the new nation would ``realize national
reunification, leaving the two social systems in the north and the
south as they are.''
   ``There is no hidden attempt to insinuate `unification through
communization' and no intention to impose our ideas and system on
the other side,'' Kang said Wednesday.
   South Korea's U.N. mission said in a statement, ``We think the
North Korean delegation's speech this morning appears to be a
compilation of their past proposals.''
   Gen. Vernon Walters, the permanent U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, said, ``I don't think there were any new elements except
the tone; the tone was considerably more conciliatory.''
   The Korean peninsula was divided at the end of World War II,
when the Soviets ended Japanese occuption in the north and the
Allies landed in the south.
   The new Korea, which Kang called ``the Democratic Confederal
Republic of Koryo,'' would have a national assembly with an equal
number of representives from the north and south.
   Kang said the proposal was first suggested by North Korea's
President Kim il-Sung in 1980, and reiterated this September.
   Koryo was one of three nations on the Korean peninsula 600 years
ago, preceding the Lee dynasty that unified the three countries and
lasted 500 years before Japan annexed Korea.
   Kang said the new Koryo would abolish former military alliances
and treaties, have a unified military command, and dissolve the
demarcation line dividing north from south at the 38th Parallel.
   The new nation also would be the sole representative of the
entire peninsula in diplomatic relations with other nations, and
hold the sole Korean seat in the United Nations, he added.
   Both Koreas currently hold non-voting observer status in the
General Assembly, and speak to the assembly by special invitation.
   Koryo would be a neutral, non-aligned nation, and the peninsula
would become a nuclear-free zone and ban the presence of foreign
troops, Kang said.
   On Tuesday, South Korean President Roh Tae-woo called for a
summit meeting with Kim to adopt a non-aggression pact, but also
told the General Assembly that before reunification could occur,
mutual trust between the nations must be established.
   Roh is to meet President Reagan today in Washington. The South
Korean leader is expected to ask Washington to improve its
relations with North Korea.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A security guard who police once made a mascot
has been charged with setting a spectacular waterfront blaze that
caused about $10 million in damage, authorities said.
   Claude Douglas Melcher, 22, also was being questioned in a $20
million, nine-alarm fire two years ago that burned for several days
and displaced hundreds of residents, police said.
   ``There are a lot of other fires we intend to question him
about,'' said Sgt. Richard J. Ellwood.
   Melcher, who according to today's editions of The Sun often
carried a plastic gun in a police holster and a police-fire radio
scanner, was held on $100,000 bond Wednesday night after his arrest
a day earlier.
   According to the newspaper, police and firefighters said he had
visited station houses for 12 years and often ran errands for
officers, who made him a mascot and outfitted him with shirts,
trousers, even a night stick.
   A firefighter quoted by The Sun without identification recalled
Melcher frequently arriving on the scene of fires before he got
there.
   ``He would beat us there, and then he would want to help with
the firehose or something,'' the firefighter said.
   Five firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the $10
million, seven-alarm blaze in the city's Fells Point section April
13. It began behind a building at Autoline Lubricants Inc., then
spread to a shack at Allied Chemical Corp.
   Melcher returned to a fire station after the fire and talked
with firefighters about it, fire officials said.
   The $20 million blaze destroyed a warehouse, three houses and
damaged up to 120 homes and businesses on Nov. 4, 1986.
   Melcher was arrested after investigators questioned him about an
Oct. 12 fire that caused $800,000 in damage at a building under
construction at the Francis Scott Key Medical Center, where he is a
security guard.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC expects to lose $20 million on the 32-hour
miniseries ``War and Remembrance'' due in part to author Herman
Wouk's restrictions on advertising, says Cap Cities-ABC Chairman
John S. Murphy.
   The restrictions on products that can advertised and the number
of commercial minutes per hour were written into Wouk's contract
for the 1983 miniseries based on his novel ``Winds of War,'' before
Cap Cities bought ABC three years ago.
   ``War and Remembrance,'' the sequel, cost $110 million to
produce.
   ABC is limited to six minutes of national advertising per hour
and is prohibited from promoting its own shows.
   ABC Television Network President John Sias, who joined Murphy on
Wednesday at a session with television critics, said Wouk won't
allow advertising of food or personal care products and of retail
stores.
   ``If I go on, I'm going to break down in tears,'' Sais said.
   ``If we don't do well with it, it's certainly something we'll
take a bath with financially, because we'll have makegoods, but
we've had those before and we'll survive,'' said Murphy, referring
to free advertising time the network has to give advertisers if the
show doesn't live up to ratings guarantees.
   He would not say what rating the network is promising
advertisers, but said the $20 million loss estimate was based on
the presumption of selling out commercial time and meeting the
guarantee.
   Sias said Murphy had tried to change Wouk's mind, but had only
received ``very eloquent turn-downs.''
   ``He's a very, very special man,'' Murphy said. ``We would be
delighted to make some sort of financial arrangement if that would
help, but it's strictly a matter of principle. He's a very unusual
man.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's No. 2 man in
Australia has denied a published report that he belongs to a KGB
spy ring, saying he is simply a career diplomat.
   ``I am not a member of the KGB. I am not being employed to
collect all sorts of intelligence about the Pacific,'' said Valery
Zemskov, minister-counsellor and second-in-charge of the Soviet
embassy.
   Zemskov called the allegation, made in the November issue of
Reader's Digest magazine of Australia, ``silly, ridiculous and
preposterous.'' He said the allegation could damage Soviet
relations with Australia if taken seriously.
   Reader's Digest senior editor John Barron said Zemskov belongs
to a highly secretive spy ring that is known to only a few people
outside the ruling Politburo.
   Barron has written books on the Soviet and American intelligence
services.
   Barron, writing in Reader's Digest, said Zemskov is a member of
the Special Reserve, which he said is a network of agents trained
to spy on foreigners as well as their own colleagues.
   ``We diplomats sometimes thrive on publicity,'' Zemskov told
reporters Wednesday. ``I am not a full colonel of the KGB. I'm not
acting for any other socialist countries. I am not a double agent
for the CIA or ASIO (Australian intelligence) or any other secret
service. I am employed as minister counsel in the embassy. Well, I
am really liking my job.''
   The opposition Liberal Party has called for Zemskov's explusion,
saying he may have gained damaging information from senior Foreign
Affairs officials that could affect Australia's foreign policy. The
party did not elaborate.
   Officials of Foreign Affairs and the Australian Intelligence and
Security Organization refused comment.

<HEAD>Mock Lockup Draws Praise from Students, Complaints from Parents</HEAD>

   Parents said they were outraged by a
27-hour high school field trip during which youths were
strip-searched, hog-tied and forced to eat fish-head soup to
simulate life under a Third-World despot.
   ``This is not anything I would have signed a consent for,''
Connie Northrop said at a school board meeting Monday.
   Her son was among 34 Wheaton North High School juniors and
seniors who participated in the mock lockup.
   She said she unaware that when she gave her son written
permission to participate he would be hog-tied and left in a room
naked and alone for 2{ hours for refusing to eat fish-head soup.
   The optional field trip to Wheaton College during the Columbus
Day weekend was intended to give students a taste of
criminal-justice systems, including that of an imagined Third World
country.
   ``This is an outrage. The word `outrage' doesn't even begin to
touch how I feel,'' said another parent, Kay McKeen, whose child
did not participate.
   The Board of Education has asked school administrators to
re-evaluate the program, arranged by high school American
government teacher David Oliphant, and report back by Nov. 14.
   ``I believe conceptually it's a very good one (program), but we
certainly can improve on our communication on some of the
specifics'' of what students were to be subjected to, said school
board President James Carr.
   Among those specifics of the program were being strip-searched,
handcuffed, eating fish-head soup and hearing chants of ``You're
the scum of the earth,'' and ``You're dirty.''
   Oliphant declined to comment other than to say it had become a
``media circus.''
   Students who participated were almost unanimous in their praise.
   ``I'm shaking, I'm so angry at these parents,'' said senior
Kelly Kyler, 18. ``It's not that I ever wanted to go to prison. But
now I have a view of what these (incarcerated) people went through.
I learned about myself.
   ``I think it's very unfair Mr. Oliphant has got to go through
this.''
   Some parents agreed.
   ``I would like to say the teacher in question has been my
senior's most inspiring teacher so far,'' said Chris Sietz.
   ``The intent of the program was to have the young people learn
and gain an appreciation for our system of democracy and our system
of laws,'' Carr said. ``Also to give them somewhat of an
understanding of what it would be like to be in prison other than
perhaps in Du Page County. Example: a Third World situation.''
   The simulation was held on the fifth floor of the Billy Graham
Center in connection with the Christian school's Institute for
Prison Ministries.
   Students from the college have participated in simulated lockups
through the sociology department since 1983. Other high school
students have gone through it, and it has been the topic of feature
stories in the Chicago Tribune and the Chronicle of Higher
Education.

<HEAD>Radiation for Ringworm Linked to Nerve Tumors</HEAD>

   The use of radiation decades ago to treat ringworm
of the scalp is causing an increase in rare tumors of the head and
neck, according to a study published today.
   ``Now, many years later, we are finding out that there were
hazards linked with this treatment,'' said Dr. John D. Boice Jr., a
co-author of the National Cancer Institute study.
   Radiation was once commonly used to treat many minor
afflictions, including acne and enlarged tonsils. It has been
largely out of favor for such purposes since the 1950s.
   The latest study, published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, was conducted in Israel on 10,834 children who received
radiation for ringworm between 1948 and 1960.
   The researchers found that 60 have developed tumors of nerve
tissue, compared with eight among a comparison group. They had
seven times the usual risk of all tumors and eight times the
typical risk of nerve tumors of the head and neck.
   However, 48 of the 60 had relatively benign tumors of nerve
wrappings. The rest had malignant cancers.
   Boice said the radiation doses received by the youngsters were
100 to 1,000 times greater than ordinary diagnostic X-rays.

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices rose moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 127.15 yen, up 0.30 yen from the previous
day's close of 126.85 yen. Opening at 127.46 yen, the currency
moved slightly lower while ranging mainly between 127.05 yen and
127.53 yen.
   The U.S. currency started trading higher in the wake of the
stronger dollar on Wall Street overnight, following the rebound of
oil prices and news the United States did not want the dollar to
decline further, dealers said.
   Although speculative investors bought dollars in early trading,
the currency failed to recover much due to the wait-and-see mood
that dominated the market, they said.
   ``The market lacked fresh incentives to inspire trading today,''
said a dealer with a major commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymtiy.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained
96.88 points, or 0.35 percent, to close at 27,390.55. The index
gained 33.36 points shortly after the market opened and continued
rising. The Nikkei closed Wednesday at 27,293.67 points.
   Trading today was mainly affected by the Bank of Japan's
approval of lower interest rates for short term transactions, said
Manji Ueda of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage firm.
   ``Since all the economic factors including lower interest rates,
the money supply in the market and company achievements have been
good, it is only natural for the share prices to rise,'' Ueda said.
   But as long as uncertainty persists over ailing Emperor
Hirohito's health, which has already dampened market activity, the
index is unlikely to recover quickly.
   In active trading today with volume on the first section
estimated at 1 billion shares, steels and oil issues were among the
most traded issues.

   A newly devised mathematical formula will let
researchers predict if a region is likely to be rocked by a strong
earthquake within three years, Soviet and U.S. scientists reported
today.
   The formula is based on changes in seismic activity before
powerful quakes in California and Nevada. The scientists used the
formula in hindsight to successfully ``predict'' 16 of 20 powerful
quakes in the Soviet Union, Central Asia, Romania, Belgium and the
U.S. Northeast.
   The technique hasn't been used to predict future quakes and
won't allow scientists to predict that a quake will occur in a
precise time and place.
   But it will allow them to make ``intermediate-term'' predictions
that a strong earthquake is likely within three years somewhere in
a broad region, said Leon Knopoff, a co-author of the study
published in the British journal Nature.
   ``This is a step toward improving the prediction of large
earthquakes in time and space,'' Knopoff, a geophysics professor at
the University of California, Los Angeles, said Wednesday.
   Scientists now are pretty much limited to making long-range
forecasts. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey predicted in
July that within 30 years, a major or great quake measuring 7 to 8
or more on the Richter scale is 60 percent likely on the San
Andreas Fault in Southern California and 50 percent likely on the
the Hayward or San Andreas faults in the San Francisco Bay area.
   Knopoff conducted the study with Vladimir Keilis-Borok and I.M.
Rotwain, of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of the
Physics of the Earth, and California Institute of Technology
geophysicist-geologist Clarence Allen, the former chairman of the
National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council.
   If the new method is proven valid, it will help government
officials and private citizens because ``even a vague description
of the area that could be at risk and a refinement in the time
scale is valuable,'' said Mike Guerin, spokesman for California's
Office of Emergency Services.
   Knowing a big quake is likely within three years in a certain
region ``sets a deadline in which they need to accomplish certain
preparations and plans,'' he added.
   But such a vague prediction would make it ``very difficult to do
anything more than is already being done in California in terms of
preparedness,'' countered Randall Updike, executive secretary of
the quake prediction council and deputy chief of the Geological
Survey's Office of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Engineering in
Reston, Va.
   The council reviewed the method during a meeting in June.
Members decided that while it was a step forward and should be
studied further, it would be premature to use it immediately to
predict three-year periods in which large quakes were likely, said
James Davis, a council member and chairman of the California
Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council.
   The Soviet-American team devised a mathematical formula to
identify ``times of increased probability'' _ roughly three-year
periods in which certain patterns of seismic activity are likely to
culminate in a strong earthquake.
   They developed the formula by studying seismic patterns that
preceded 14 earthquakes of 6.4 magnitude or more in California and
Nevada between 1938 and 1984.
   The scientists then tested the formula by applying it to 20
quakes in five other regions of the world since 1963. The formula
found that 16 of those quakes were preceded by ``times of increased
probability'' for large temblors.
   The patterns incorporated into the formula included above- or
below-normal numbers of smaller jolts, the rate at which such
quakes increased or decreased, the size of those smaller quakes,
the number of aftershocks following such quakes and whether such
quakes in one area were followed immediately by quakes in a distant
area.

<HEAD>Company That Owns ``Happy Birthday'' Song is For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Happy Birthday to You,'' a song that seems to
belong to everyone, can be bought by whoever purchases the company
that owns its copyright.
   The Sengstack family of Princeton, N.J., which for half a
century has owned Birchtree Ltd., the company that holds the
copyright to the song, has decided to sell the company, The New
York Times reported today.
   The concern could sell for $12 million or more.
   ``Happy Birthday'' brings in about $1 million a year, the
newspaper said. The song's 75-year copyright expires in 2010, when
it enters the public domain.
   Patty Smith Hill and her sister, Mildred J. Hill, two
kindergarten teachers from Louisville, Ky., who also taught Sunday
school, wrote the song. It was included in ``Song Stories for the
Sunday School,'' a book they wrote in 1893.
   In its original version, the ``Happy Birthday'' melody had the
lyrics: ``Good Morning to you, good morning to you, good morning
dear children, good morning to all.''
   Only later did the sisters add the birthday words.
   ``Happy Birthday,'' is one of the three most popular songs in
the English language along with ``Auld Lang Syne'' and ``For He's a
Jolly Good Fellow,'' according to the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   ``Happy Birthday'' is also sung in many other languages,
including Spanish, Dutch, Swedish and Malaysian.
   The Sengstack family acquired the song when John F. Sengstack, a
New York accountant, bought the Clayton F. Summy Co., a Chicago
sheet-music retailer that published the Hill sisters' work. The
copyright was registered by Summy in 1935.
   Besides owning the copyright to about 50,000 titles, Birchtree
owns the Suzuki Method, a musical instrumental instruction method
for children, and the Francis Clark library for piano students.
   Some peculiar situations have arisen as a result of an effort to
enforce the copyright of a song as popular as ``Happy Birthday.''
   By law, any public performance for profit or mechanical
reproduction should require a fee.
   Summy sued Postal Telegraph in the 1940s when the song was used
in singing telegrams. The lawsuit was dropped when company lawyers
were stymied by the argument that even though the song was used for
profit, it was not sung in public.
   The company also objected when Frederick's of Hollywood
advertised underwear that played ``Happy Birthday.''
   Casio digital watches that can be programmed to play the
birthday song every hour on the owner's birthday bring Birchtree a
penny a watch.

   Israeli leaders vowed today to punish the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah for a suicide car bomb that blew up at a
border crossing in Lebanon, killing seven Israeli soldiers and
wounding 10 others.
   The attack on the army convoy Wednesday afternoon was the worst
against an Israeli target in Lebanon since Israel withdrew most of
its occupation troops from the country three years ago.
   ``I am sure that the state of Israel and its army will not
remain still until we reach the source of the evil, the source of
the attack,'' Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Israel radio.
``What must be clear to Hezbollah is that it will receive its just
punishment.''
   ``Israel's just and secure hand will reach the killers, each and
every one of them,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said.
   Israel's inner cabinet, the country's top decision-making body,
met today to discuss the attack, which occurred Wednesday when a
suicide assassin drove a bomb-laden truck between two Israeli
convoys.
   In Beirut, the military wing of Hezbollah, or The Party of God,
claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had mobilized its
forces for an Israeli reprisal.
   Hezbollah has been demanding action to force Israel to withdraw
its troops from south Lebanon.
   But Islamic Resistance, a loose coalition of pro-Iranian
Lebanese groups, also claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Israeli radio stations reported Shiite Moslems in south Lebanon
fleeing to the north in fear of an Israeli attack. The reports did
not elaborate.
   Despite the tensions, the ``Good Fence,'' crossing point at
Metullah was re-opened this morning and Lebanese workers were
permitted to head to jobs in northern Israel's Galilee.
   However, soldiers refused to let reporters through the gate to
Lebanon to examine the site of Wednesday's blast.
   The army said the bomb exploded 300 yards north of the ``Good
Fence'' border crossing at 1:25 p.m. as two groups of Israeli
military vehicles passed each other, one headed home and the other
into Lebanon.
   ``It was a very powerful charge,'' said Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled,
head of Israel's northern command.
   ``There was something large, black, and black smoke came out,
and many things flew in the air. Our van was burning, about to
explode,'' an unidentified injured soldier said on army radio.
   An Israeli officer said a white Toyota truck, driven by an Arab
exploded between the two convoys.
   ``The commanders got out to talk. The Toyota came in between the
two groups of vehicles and exploded,'' the officer said on
condition of anonymity.
   Seven soldiers died and eight soldiers and two Lebanese women
were wounded, the army said.
   The blast left a 15-foot-wide crater. Witnesses said they saw
pools of blood. Trees were scorched.
   The body of the assassin was not found and his vehicle was
unrecognizable.
   Israel television quoted army experts as saying the truck
contained up to 330 pounds of explosives. Blasts were heard four
miles away and broke windows in this small border town.
   Wounded soldiers were taken to Israeli hospitals and the army
said one was in critical condition.
   The army command identified five of the dead as Capt. Ron
Verner, 22; Sgt. Shalom Ben-Ami, 23; Sgt. Moris Dahan, 31; Cpl.
Saguy Blau, 19, and Pvt. Yakov Ben-Shaanan, 44.
   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian
militia, interrogated hundreds of Shiite Moslems in southern
Lebanon Wednesday, Israel radio said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the incident nevertheless
proved the value of Israel's self-declared security zone, a buffer
six to 10 miles deep in south Lebanon.
   The last major car bomb attack occurred near the border crossing
on March 10, 1985, shortly before most Israeli troops were
withdrawn after three years of occupation. The attack, claimed by
the pro-Syrian Lebanese Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party, killed
12 Israeli soldiers and wounded 14.
   Israel created the ``Good Fence'' in 1976 to provide medical and
other aid to refugees from Lebanon's civil war. It is used today
mostly by Lebanese workers who travel to Israel daily.

   Hollywood blue bloods and real
royalty mingled in a gala tribute to the late actor Cary Grant to
benefit the Princess Grace Foundation.
   Grant starred with then-actress Grace Kelly in the 1955 thriller
``To Catch a Thief.''
   Wednesday night's black-tie affair at the Beverly Hilton's
International Ballroom drew the royal family of Monaco and many of
Hollywood's top names.
   The guest list included Quincy Jones, Sophia Loren, Henry
Mancini, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Liza Minnelli, Warren
Beatty, Shirley Temple Black, Michael Caine, John Forsythe, Walter
Matthau, Dina Merrill, Robert Mitchum, Roger Moore, Gregory Peck,
Eva Marie Saint, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart and Robert Wagner.
   Grant's widow, Barbara, and his daughter, Jennifer, decided the
event would be the sole tribute to the actor, who died in 1986 at
age 82.
   ``Jennifer Grant and I wanted there to be just one special
tribute to Cary, and due to his close friendship with Princess
Grace and her family, we decided the proceeds from the evening
should benefit the foundation named in her honor, which favors
emerging young film, theater, and dance artists throughout America
with scholarships, apprenticeships, fellowships and special
grants,'' Mrs. Grant said in a statement.
   Princess Grace, who left acting behind when she married Prince
Rainier of Monaco, died in 1982 from injuries in a car accident.
   The prince, along with his son, Albert, and daughter Stephanie
were among those greeting the guests, all who shared anecdotes
about Grant, the embodiment of the class act in Hollywood.
   ``He was my first date when I came to America,'' gushed Eva
Gabor.
   ``He was always kind, gentle, funny,'' said actress Polly
Bergen. ``I think Cary was the ultimate gentleman, the ultimate
elegant man. He was the single, most elegant man I ever saw. Even
dressed casually lolling on a plane, he was always the dream of the
world; kind funny, tender, elegant.''
   ``Dynasty'' star Linda Evans said: ``He was just as charming off
screen as he was on.''
   ``I knew Cary Grant since I was a kid,'' said actor Robert Stack.
   ``He represented to me, growing up as a young actor, everything
that every actor wants to be and seldom does.''

   A judge begged for help over a
courthouse intercom moments before her estranged husband, an
off-duty police officer, fatally shot her in her chambers,
authorities said.
   District Judge Carol S. Irons, 40, was shot in the throat at
least once Wednesday and stumbled into a hallway, where her
husband, Clarence Ratliff, 53, followed her and fired at least two
more shots, police said. She was pronounced dead in a jury room
minutes later.
   ``Judge Irons came out of her chambers bent over with her hands
reaching for her throat, asking ... `Please, help me!''' Police
Chief William Hegarty said at a news conference.
   Ratliff, a 21-year police department veteran, briefly exchanged
gunfire in a corridor with officers who answered Irons' pleas, and
then barricaded himself in her chambers.
   He surrendered within minutes and was arrested at the
courthouse, the site of the couple's marriage four years ago.
Ratliff was held in the city jail today pending the filing of
formal charges.
   The police chief said Ratliff had no history of mental problems
and there was no reason to believe Irons feared him. Ratliff, who
was on night patrol duty, was in civilian clothes when he entered
the chambers at midday.
   Moments later, the judge apparently triggered an alarm in her
chambers, and a police dispatcher called there on an intercom, said
police Lt. Vic Gillis. ``The dispatcher ... asked if anything was
wrong,'' Gillis said. ``She said something to the effect that she
was not OK, that her ex-husband was in there and holding a gun on
her.''
   Officers responded quickly because the police department is next
to the Hall of Justice. Within seconds, Ratliff began firing,
authorities said. Hegarty said it was unknown if Ratliff used his
service revolver.
   The courthouse has no metal detector, but Hegarty said he
doubted such security would have prevented the shooting.
   The couple were in divorce proceedings; it was the second
marriage for both. The pair had no children together, although
Ratliff has children from a previous marriage.
   ``When she told me she was filing for divorce, she mentioned she
thought the worst of it was over and thought it would be much
easier from then on,'' said Chief District Judge Donald Johnston,
who spoke with Irons minutes before she was killed.
   ``But there were no indications that there was any violence in
their marriage or that she was fearful of him,'' said Johnston, who
married the couple.
   Irons, a former assistant Kent County prosecutor, was elected in
1982 as the first female judge in the county. The Wayne State
University graduate was running unopposed for re-election this fall.
   The Kent County Hall of Justice, which houses the district and
circuit courts as well as the police department for Michigan's
second-largest city, closed for the day after the shooting.
   Psychologists were being called in for court employees shaken by
the shooting.

<HEAD>Buddhist Monks' Death Sentence Prompts Australian Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Buddhist monks have been
sentenced to death in Vietnam for alleged subversive activities and
Australia has filed a protest with the Vietnamese government,
Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said.
   Evans said he instructed the Australian ambassador in Hanoi to
protest the death sentences after finding out the monks had been
condemned to death following a trial in Ho Chi Minh City in late
September.
   The monks, Thich Tue Si, a philosopher, writer and teacher, and
Thich Tri Sieu, an eminent scholar, were arrested in 1984 with 19
Buddhist scholars. The monks were sentenced to death, while the
scholars were given undisclosed terms of imprisonment.
   The exact nature of the allegedly subversive activity was not
immediately known.
   The Foreign Ministry said the Vietnamese community in Australia
asked Sen. Margaret Reid to take up the issue after reading of the
sentences in a Vietnamese newspaper earlier this month. The
ministry said Ms. Reid then brought the matter to Evans' attention.
   Evans said Ambassador Graham Alliband was told to take the
matter up with the appropriate Vietnamese authorities, ``making it
clear, as we have with a number of other instances around the
world, the Australian Government's abhorrence of and complete
opposition to capital punishment.''

<HEAD>Dissident Leader Claims He Was Tortured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent dissident leader told
National Assembly members that he was tortured and forced to
confess that he was a communist, officials said today.
   Testifying under oath before the National Assembly's Home
Affairs Committee Wednesday, Kim Keun-tae recounted 23 days of
alleged police torture he had undergone in 1987, the officials said.
   ``I was forced to sign a false statement that I was helping
North Korea, and I am still suffering from the after-effect of
police torture,'' the officials quoted Kim as saying.
   Kim, then head of the Youth League for Democratization, was
found guilty of anti-state charges and sentenced to five years'
imprisonment in 1985. He was released in June under a special
amnesty.
   Kim drew international attention after he won the 1987 Robert
Kenndy Human Rights Award.
   After his release, Kim filed a lawsuit against several police
officers who allegedly tortured him during the investigation. On
Wednesday, he was summoned to testify before the National Assembly.
   According to the officials, Kim, 35, said he was arrested by
police in September 1987 without a warrant. He said he only fought
for democracy and had no connection with communist North Korea.
   For several weeks under police detention, Kim said he was denied
contact with his lawyer and family in violation with law and
subject to torture.
   ``I was tortured twice with water and eight times with electric
shocks,'' Kim said.
   Police wrapped his body in a blanket, tied him with ropes and
covered his face with a towel, over which water was dripped so that
he had to drink until he became almost unconscious, he said.
   The investigators then sent electric shocks through his body, he
said.
   ``The pain was so acute and unbearable I kept on shouting that
they would kill me,'' he was quoted as saying.
   A police officer, who also testified to the same Assembly
committee, denied that he and his colleagues had tortured Kim.
   Kim's case resurfaced as the National Assembly continued to
scrutinize state affairs under a parliamentary prerogative, revived
for the first time in 16 years under a new constitution adopted in
a national referendum late last year.
   The parliamentary investigation is focusing on corruption, human
rights violations and irregularities allegedly committed under the
government of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Chun, who stepped down in February at the end of a seven-year
term, has come under a parliamentary probe of his alleged
involvement in financial and other scandals.
   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was recently sentenced
to seven years' imprisonment for taking bribes and misusing
millions of dollars in government money while he headed a rural
development program.
   The three major opposition groups are jointly moving to subpoena
the ex-president to testify before the Assembly, but the government
camp objects to the move.

<TEXT>
   Authorities say they have arrested
a former U.S. resident who faces a death penalty in the Soviet
Union for allegedly killing Latvian women and children during World
War II.
   Boleslav Maikovskis, 83, was being investigated ``in connection
with charges of murder and attempted murder,'' said Klaus Schacht,
a prosecutor with Dortmund's war crimes investigation office.
   The announcement that Maikovskis was arrested Wednesday came
just one day after officials said he had applied for political
asylum in West Germany after fleeing the United States last year.
   Maikovskis, a former head of a Latvian police force created by
the Nazis, is accused by the Soviets of burning down villages in
addition to fatally shooting women and children. In 1965, the
Soviets sentenced Maikovskis to death in absentia for his alleged
war crimes.
   Schacht said Maikovskis was being held in a prison hospital, but
did not specify where.
   ``He needs constant doctors' care,'' Schacht told The Associated
Press today. He said he would release further details at a news
conference later today.
   Maikovskis had been living in Mineola, N.Y. since 1951 and but
had been fighting deportation proceedings in recent years. On
Friday, the U.S. Justice Department acknowledged that he fled the
country and that it had lost track of him.
   Maikovskis was picked up at his residence in Muenster early
Wednesday after officials decided he might attempt to flee West
Germany, Schacht said.
   Investigators were basing their initial probe on evidence
presented at another war crimes trial in West Germany in 1976
during which Maikovskis ``was mentioned several times.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Tuesday
in Moscow that the Soviets are ``ready to give all the necessary
information'' to West Germany.
   Schacht said that his office would welcome any assistance from
Moscow. He declined to speculate on whether Maikovskis would be
deported to the Soviet Union.
   Schacht said prosecutors are checking 20 volumes of court
records relating to the war crimes case in which Maikovskis had
been mentioned.
   He said Maikovskis entered the country on a passport issued by
the Latvian government in exile, which is recognized by West
Germany.
   On Tuesday, the Nuremberg-based federal office for political
asylum requests said Maikovskis applied for asylum about a year
ago. A decision on the request is expected by late November.
   Maikovskis probably has been living in West Germany since
submitting the request in November 1987, said federal asylum office
spokesman Wolfgang Weickhardt. Decisions on asylum requests
normally take a year.
   The United States began deportation proceedings against
Maikovskis in 1976. His final appeal was denied by the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1986.

   Two cosmonauts left the orbiting space station Mir
today to make a second attempt to repair a Dutch-made telescope,
Radio Moscow reported.
   Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov were using new tools and
materials brought to the space station by the cargo ferry ship
Progress recently, the broadcast said.
   Titov and Manarov had tried unsuccessfully in a five-hour space
walk June 30 to replace a detector unit on the telescope, which was
mounted on an observatory attached to Mir. Components of the unit
melted because of exposure to cosmic radiation, Radio Moscow said.
The problem in the June repair attempt was that the cosmonauts
couldn't unfasten the clasp holding the balky detector unit to the
telescope, the Tass news agency said at the time.
   In today's space walk, scheduled to last several hours, Titov
and Manarov were wearing new spacesuits designed to allow the
cosmonauts more flexibility, Soviet television reported.
   Titov and Manarov have been aboard Mir since last December and
are scheduled to set a new space endurance record before returning
to Earth this December, Soviet officials have said.
   A third cosmonaut, Dr. Valery Polyakov, arrived aboard Mir in
September to monitor the health of Titov and Manarov. Polyakov
stayed inside the space station during Thursday's spacewalk to
check on-board systems and the health of Titov and Manarov, Tass
said.
   The Mir station was launched Feb. 20, 1986 and the Kvant
orbiting observatory was attached to it in early 1987.

<HEAD>Officers Brave Mountain Lions To Arrest Couple Indicted On Drug
Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six mountain lions guarding a suspected
drug traffickers' home were among the property seized during a
series of raids that led to 33 arrests on marijuana smuggling
charges, authorities said.
   One state official had to fend off an attack from one of the
150-pound cats during the raids, which culminated a two-year
federal probe of alleged Gulf Coast marijuana smuggling operations.
   The 33 suspects arrested, including many commerical fishermen,
were among 89 people indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury on
a charge of conspiracy to import at least 300,000 pounds of
marijuana into Florida. Most were still at large today.
   Authorities in southwest Florida also seized more than $3.5
million in boats and homes in connection with the case.
   The mountain lion attack came as three U.S. Customs Service
agents in disguise accompanied three state wildlife officers to
Warren and Linda Stewart's home, which was surrounded by an
electified 8-foot fence.
   The officers arrived on the pretense of inspecting the six
western cougars kept by the couple, who had permits for them.
   But when a wildlife officer went into a bedroom a cat pounced.
   ``All he saw were eyes and teeth,'' said Lt. Jim Huffstodt of
the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   A bulletproof vest protected him from the cougar's claws,
Huffstodt said. The cats were taken to a panther expert for
safekeeping.
   The Stewarts were among those accused of taking part in 10
failed seagoing ventures aimed at bringing 300,000 pounds of
marijuana, which had an estimated street value of $147 million,
said U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman.
   Several of those arrested were accused in multiple indictments.
Charges include taking part in a continuing criminal enterprise,
smuggling, conspiracy to smuggle marijuana, possession with intent
to distribute and conspiracy to possess.
   If convicted, the 89 people indicted face a mandatory minimum of
10 years in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Doug Frazier.

   Serbs angered by the outcome of a
three-day Central Committee meeting today resumed a boycott of
school and university classes in the ethnically troubled province
of Kosovo.
   The boycott first started in late September with a march by
several hundred Slav students in Kosovo's capital Pristina but was
called off in advance of a marathon three-day meeting of the
Central Committee in Belgrade that ended Wednesday.
   Serbs said the meeting did little to resolve the country's
current economic and ethnic crisis.
   At the meeting, four Politburo members formally resigned and
another one, a leader identified with a Serbian campaign for
greater control over Kosovo, offered to step down after losing an
unprecedented vote of confidence.
   ``The evident dissatisfaction among Serbs and Montenegrins with
the outcome'' of the meeting prompted them to continue the class
boycott in Kosovo Thursday, the state news agency Tanjug said.
   Slavs in Kosovo also scheduled a mass rally today to express
their unhappiness about the outcome of the meeting in Belgrade.
   Serbs and Montenegrins are Slavs. They have been rallying by the
hundreds of thousands to push for more control over Kosovo, an
ancient Slav heartland bordering Albania that is now dominated by
ethnic Albanians.
   At today's rally, to be held in a suburb of Kosovo's capital
Pristina, Kosovo's 200,000 Serbs say they will decide whether they
will leave the region permanently in the face of what they allege
is constant harassment from the ethnic Albanian majority. They
would go to Serbia.
   Kosovo has been at the center of a drive by Serbian Communist
party leader Slobodan Milosevic to extend Serbian control over the
province.
   That campaign was dealt an implicit blow Wednesday, when a close
ally of Milosevic in the Politburo failed to muster enough votes
from the 165-member Central Committee to win a secret vote of
confidence.
   National party chief Stipe Suvar, at a news conference, said it
was the first time a member of the presidium, or Politburo, had
failed to win such a vote.
   Ten of the 23-member presidium were up for the vote, which
exempted four members who had resigned earlier and nine who hold
their seats as party chiefs of Yugoslavia's six republics, two
provinces and the armed forces.
   As Serbian party leader, Milosevic was therefore exempt.
   But his close ally Dusan Ckrebic got only 68 of the 83 votes he
would have needed to win the secret ballot. The other nine members
won given the Central Committee's support.
   Ckrebic immediately offered to resign. But a visibly angry
Milosevic intervened twice to postpone acceptance until the next
session of the presidium, due by the end of this month.
   This was seen as a clear victory for opponents of Milosevic, who
fear his popular support in Serbia is jeopardizing the fragile
ethnic balance in this Balkan nation.
   The session offered no real solutions to the country's mounting
ethnic and labor unrest, and its deepest economic crisis since
World War II. Inflation is 217 percent over the last 12 months.
   The four Politburo members whose earlier resignations were
officially accepted by the Central Committee included two former
party heads, Bosko Krunic and Milanko Renovica, a senior Communist
from liberal northern Slovenia, Franc Setinc, and an ethnic
Albanian leader from Kosovo, Kolj Siroka.
   They resigned for different reasons, but all had come under
increasing fire in the state media and at mass public rallies
staged by Serbs to press their demands over Kosovo.
   In an apparent attempt to defuse tension and keep protests off
the streets, Belgrade authorities on Wednesday postponed
indefinitely a mass rally scheduled for Saturday in the capital.
   Up to 1 million Serbs had been expected at the gathering,
intended to give support to Milosevic and to the Slav minority in
Kosovo.

<HEAD>Chamber Votes To Impose Tax On Plastic Bags</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Committee of the Chamber of
Deputies has voted overwhelmingly to impose a 13-cent tax on
plastic shopping bags to discourage their use.
   The decision to tax plastic shopping bags must be put to a vote
by the full Chamber and the Senate, but passage was expected
because all the major parties supported the Wednesday's measure.
   Most supermarkets already charge consumers for each plastic bag,
usually 7 cents. Some shoppers bring their own bags to supermarkets
so they don't have to pay extra to take home their purchases.
   Under the proposal, supermarkets would begin charging customers
around 21 cents per plastic bag. Other stores would charge 13 cents
a bag.
   The proposed law comes at a time when Italy is struggling with
garbage disposal problems.
   The vote was 22-5, unlikely political allies _ the
environmentalist Greens and the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement
_ voting for it, the Italian news agency AGI reported. The ``no''
votes were cast by Italy's largest party, the Christian Democrats,
which is pressing for a tax on all plastic.
   Assoplast, the producers association for the plastics industry,
said in a statement that the measure ``doesn't resolve in the least
the environmental problems connected with plastic bags, which only
pollute in the sense that they can be an eyesore, and make up only
7-8 percent of urban garbage.''

<HEAD>Veep: Government Should Have Been Tougher In Base Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Salvador Laurel said
today the government should have served notice it would close U.S.
military bases before beginning talks with Washington on their
future.
   Laurel also said the new bases agreement shows that President
Corazon Aquino plans to renew their lease when it expires in 1991.
   The accord, signed Monday in Washington by U.S. Secretary of
State George Schultz and Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, allows
the United States to maintain six military bases here in exchange
for $962 million in military and economic aid during the lease's
last two years.
   ``Had we considered only the larger national interest instead of
the purely mercenary consideration, we should have instead first
issued a notice of termination,'' Laurel told foreign and local
businessmen.
   ``It is obvious that the Aquino leadeship has already, if
secretly, committed itself to renegotiate extension of the bases
beyond 1991,'' Laurel added.
   Laurel broke with the administration in September and formed his
own political party after Mrs. Aquino refused his call for her to
resign.
   The Senate created a special committee Wednesday to determine
whether the new bases agreement violates the Philippine
Constitution.
   The committee is also to determine whether the accord, actually
an amendment to a 1947 agreement, is subject to approval by the
Senate as some senators claim. Mrs. Aquino said it is not.
   The agreement has been attacked by the press and various groups
but Mrs. Aquino dismissed the criticism on Wednesday, and the
largest political party in the Philippine Congress pledged to
support it.
   The United States had been paying $180 million a year for use of
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations.
   Despite the increase, the agreement has met with criticism
because of the government raised expectations that it would hold
out for $1.2 billion a year.
   Mrs. Aquino argued that the agreement was for substantially more
than the agreement negotiated by ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition he not be further
identified, said the original Philippine demand was for nearly $2.4
billion a year.

<HEAD>McMartin Molest Case Defense Opens With Lawyer Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense opened in the McMartin pre-school
molestation trial with a attorney calling himself as the first
witness to attack a jailhouse informant's credibility.
   Danny Davis, attorney for principal defendant Raymond Buckey,
took the stand Wednesday seeking to prove that his client never
confessed to the informant that he had sexually abused children.
   Buckey, 30, and his 61-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey,
are charged with 65 molestation and conspiracy counts in the case
of the school where children said they were molested and subjected
to bizarre satanic rites. The Manhattan Beach school was closed
five years ago.
   The prosecution alleges Buckey and his mother molested children,
but the defense has said it will show that if children were
sexually abused, it happened elsewhere and people other than the
defendants did it.
   During his unusual testimony, Davis insisted he had no memory of
the events he was testifying about. He referred instead to a memo
he dictated.
   The tactic was apparently used so that Davis could avoid
violating his attorney-client privilege with Buckey by abstaining
from references to conversations between the two men that
prosecutors might want to explore in questioning.
   ``I don't independently recall the conversation without
referring to the document,'' said Davis, referring to a memo
written after interviewing both Buckey and the informant, George
Freeman, at the county jail on March 28, 1984.
   Davis recalled that he went to the jail when he heard that
Buckey had been moved into a cell with another prisoner. He said he
was concerned for Buckey's physical safety.
   ``I was also concerned that Mr. Freeman might be an individual
who would concoct a story about my client,'' Davis said.
   Freeman, a convicted felon and jailhouse informant who testified
early in the 17-month trial, claimed that Buckey confessed to him
about molesting a child. The informant also contended that Davis
tried to intimidate him.
   In his jailhouse visit, Davis said Freeman ``did tell me some
things that he said my client had told him.''
   ``Did Freeman indicate that Mr. Buckey made any statements about
having relations with children?'' asked attorney Edward Rucker, who
was brought in to conduct the witness stand examination.
   ``No, he did not,'' said Davis.
   ``Did Mr. Freeman indicate that Ray Buckey denied wrongdoing?''
   ``Yes, he did,'' said Davis.
   Davis further said Freeman spoke of having been a Hell's Angel
and said he had ``lied as a snitch before.''
   He said Buckey admitted discussing the case with Freeman and
telling the informant that it was ``a setup.''
   But specifics of the conversations were not related because of
attorney-client privilege. The prosecution did not get a chance to
cross-examine.
   Later, Davis adamantly denied that he had ever threatened
Freeman.
   ``I didn't do that,'' he said under questioning by Mrs. Buckey's
lawyer, Dean Gits.
   Another issue argued Wednesday was whether jurors should be
taken to see the former school. Prosecutors objected because they
said the defense has removed shrubbery which blocked people from
looking inside.

   The government today suspended
military operations against anti-government Sinhalese militants for
one week and said it would soon release 788 political prisoners.
   National Security Minister Lalith Athulathmudali said both moves
were aimed at restoring peace on this island nation, racked by five
years of ethnic violence.
   The minister said the changes would ``give a chance to those
involved in political murders to stop those acts and get on to more
democratic forms of protest.''
   ``This step has been taken by the government purely to save
innocent lives,'' Athulathmudali said.
   The People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group
opposed to the government's peace overtures with the minority
Tamils, have been accused of killing at least 500 people the past
year.
   Most victims have been government supporters and people trying
to make peace with Tamil extremists fighting for a separate nation
in the northeastern province.
   The minister also said the government would expedite the release
of the 788 political prisoners against whom charges have yet to be
filed.
   The People's Liberation Front led by Rohana Wijeweera, a medical
dropout from Moscow's Patrice Lumumba University, is opposed to an
India-brokered peace accord because it claims the pact gives too
many concessions to Tamils who comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people.
   There was no immediate reaction on the government's offer.
   The accord, signed in 1987, calls for greater autonomy for
provincial councils in the northeastern district where Tamils are
in a majority. Under terms of the accord, the north and eastern
provinces were merged into a single adminstrative unit.
   The pact has, however, failed to stop bloodshed in Sri Lanka
after the most important of the Tamil rebels groups, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, reneged after initially agreeing on its
terms, saying it did not meet their aspirations.
   India has an estimated 47,000 troops in Sri Lanka to disarm the
Tamil militants and enforce the accord. India got involved because
60 million politically powerful Tamils in southern Tamil Nadu state
are sympathetic to the rebel cause.

   The dollar eased in quiet European trading today,
pressured by lack of interest from market participants and
technical factors, foreign currency dealers said. Gold prices rose.
   Traders said the dollar dropped from the levels it reached in
earlier Asian trading as corporate market players filled their
daily requirements and withdrew from the market.
   They said the dollar is likely to continue trading in a narrow
range until economic developments or statements by American
policy-makers create enough momentum to move the currency one way

   Police arrested two British Broadcasting
Corp. producers and held them for 24 hours, a colleague said today.
The arrests came four days after President Daniel arap Moi accused
the BBC of supporting subversives in Kenya.
   The BBC employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
plainclothes officers Tuesday night took Ali Saleh, a Tanzanian,
and Ruth Thorlby, a Briton, from Midland Hotel in Nakuru, 100 miles
northwest of Nairobi, and kept them in cells for eight hours.
   John Tusa, BBC world service managing director, who was in
Nairobi, immediately protested the police action.
   ``The BBC deeply regrets the Kenya Police action in interferring
with its normal journalistic and publicity activities,'' Tusa said
in a statement Wednesday night.
   Saleh and Thorlby are in Kenya to interview listeners about the
reception of a recently refurbished BBC's relay station in the
Indian Ocean island republic of Seychelles.
   Police took Saleh and Thorlby to an unidentified government
building and questioned them about their Nakuru visit, the BBC
employee said, and then took them to a police station and locked
them in cells.
   Earlier in the day, Saleh and Thorlby had met government
officials and school teachers.
   ``No one told them what was happening,'' the colleague said.
   Saleh and Thorlby on Wednesday evening were driven to the
Criminal Investigation Department in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.
They were handed back their personal belongings, including
passports and money, and ordered to report back on Friday. Police
kept their recording equipment and BBC promotional posters.
   Kenya regularly criticizes the foreign media, and in recent past
has singled out the BBC's coverage of the East Affrican nation.
   Moi, in a speech marking the 10th anniversary of his presidency
Oct. 14, criticized the BBC and said it supports subversives.
   Tusa had earlier defended the London-based organization and said
that efforts to get the offical view on events were hampered by the
inaccessibility of government officials and their reluctance to be
interviewed.
   Moi said Tusa had said ``BBC has been accurate, factual and
true. I agree. They have been accurate, factual, true in supporting
subversives.''
   Tusa issued a statement rejecting the charge and regretted the
``unwarranted escalation of attacks on our journalism.''

<TEXT>
   The Basque separatist group ETA claimed
responsibility today for the bombing deaths last week of a Basque
policeman and a paramilitary Civil Guard.
   In a statement sent to local papers, ETA said it had planted a
bomb that exploded in a train tunnel early Sunday in Legazpi, near
the Basque city of San Sebastian, instantly killing Jose Juan
Pacheco Cano, 26.
   Pacheco Cano, a member of the autonomous Basque region's police
unit, the Ertzantza, had joined in a search for bombs after a local
travel bureau received a warning that explosives had been planted
in the area.
   In the second attack, a car bomb exploded late Sunday as a unit
of the paramilitary Civil Guard passed by near the Pamplona,
Navarre, city jail. The driver, Julio Gangoso, 31, was killed and
seven others were injured.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque country and annexation of the neighboring Navarre
region.
   Since beginning its violent campaign for independence in 1968,
ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people,
mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers.
   So far this year ETA has claimed 13 killings, including that of
Pacheco Cano, the first officer of the autonomous Basque region's
police unit to die in an ETA attack.
   In its note ETA called the latter's death ``an accident.''

<HEAD>Government Lifts Limits on Subscriptions After Public Complaints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of public outcry, the cabinet has
lifted restrictions on subscriptions to popular newspapers and
magazines, Pravda reported today.
   The action by the Council of Ministers, in a meeting Wednesday,
signaled a victory for Soviets who had deluged the press with
letters complaining about the restrictions.
   The council said ``huge inadequacies and oversights'' were
committed by the Communications Ministry and State Publishing
Committee in limiting 1989 subscriptions to certain newspapers and
magazines.
   Last year, it was announced that applications for 1989
subscriptions would be accepted throughout 1988. In previous years,
orders were taken only after Aug. 1. But when Jan. 1 rolled around,
Soviets were told they could only sign up for newspapers, and had
to wait until August for magazine subscription applications.
   On July 20, the Communications Ministry issued an order limiting
the number of 1989 subscriptions to their 1988 level. Further
restrictions applied to 41 publications, including such popular
sellers as Ogonyok, Soviet Sport and Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   Communications Minister Vassily A. Shamshin told the Council of
Ministers on Wednesday all the restrictions have been lifted, and
that the period during which requests for 1989 subscriptions would
be accepted has been extended until Nov. 15. In addition, requests
for 1990 subscriptions will be taken beginning Jan. 2, instead of
August as originally scheduled.
   In imposing the limits, the Communications Ministry said there
was not enough paper to print all the newspapers and magazines
needed to keep up with demand. But in September, the government
found new paper supplies for next year. The Communications
Ministry, however, did not then lift the subscription restrictions,
the council said.
   Thousands of Soviets have been turned away from post offices
where they hoped to apply for 1989 subscriptions, and some have
claimed the paper shortage explanation was just an excuse by
conservatives to stifle President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
openness and his economic and social reforms.

   Anti-apartheid organizations
today called for a nationwide protest on the final day of voting in
segregated municipal elections.
   Officials of churches, trade unions and human rights groups said
in a statement that the protest next Wednesday was intended to
demonstrate opposition to ``these apartheid elections in the
clearest possible way.''
   State-of-emergency regulations prohibit calls for politically
motivated strikes and work stoppages, but previous national
protests during the 28-month-old emergency have taken the form of
widespread general strikes.
   The government has outlawed calls for an election boycott. This
prohibition has been defied openly by anti-apartheid clergymen,
including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   Wednesday is officially designated as Election Day, but the
government, seeking to maximize the turnout, has allowed voters to
cast votes in advance during a 12-day period ending Saturday.
   The elections mark the first time South Africans of all races
are voting at the same time, and the government depicts the
balloting as an important extension of democracy. Anti-apartheid
groups disagree, saying black municipal councils are
government-controlled and rejecting participation in local
elections until blacks get voting rights on the national level.
   ``The municipal elections are undemocratic, fradulent and
unjust,'' said Titus Mafolo, an official of the banned United
Democratic Front, at a news conference announcing the protest.
``These elections are being forced on our people by the security
forces, the state propaganda system and collaborators.''
   In Soweto, the largest black township, less than 4 percent of
the 347,000 registered voters had voted as of Wednesday, officials
said. Nico Malan, the white town clerk who oversees Soweto, said he
would be satisified with a final turnout of 20 percent.
   In several large townships, no elections are taking place
because of a lack of candidates. Elsewhere, black candidates' homes
have been bombed in what the government says is an intimidation
campaign waged by the outlawed African National Congress.
   The main focus of the white election is the contest between the
governing National Party and the extreme-right Conservative Party,
which seeks to intensify segregation laws. The Conservatives are
favored to outpoll the Nationalists in Transvaal, the most populous
of the four provinces.
   Earlier this year, in an effort to placate conservative whites,
the government drafted a bill to tighten enforcement of the Group
Areas Act, which mandates residential segregation. On Wednesday,
President P.W. Botha postponed action the bill, leaving little
chance it could become law before Election Day.

   A scheduled visit today by
Zaire's foreign minister has been postponed indefinitely, the
government announced.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the three-day
visit by his counterpart from Zaire, Nguza Karl-I-Bond, was
postponed due to ``unforseen circumstances.'' There was no
elaboration and no firm indication whether the visit would be
rescheduled.
   There have been unconfirmed reports the Zairean delegation
requested meetings with leading black opponents of the government,
including jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   In recent weeks, South Africa has launched an ambitious
diplomatic offensive to ease its long-standing isolation from the
rest of Africa.
   President P.W. Botha, who has been in power since 1978, had not
held a summit in black Africa until he met last month with
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano. Botha has followed up that
trip with visits to Malawi, Zaire and the Ivory Coast.
   He pronoucned his Oct. 1 meeting with Zaire's President Mobutu
Sese Seko a success, although no joint agreements were announced.
Mobutu said afterward that Botha had promised that Mandela would
soon be released unconditionally, but South African authorities
have refused to confirm this.

<HEAD>Woman Goes Undercover to Nab Dealers Who Sold to Her Daughters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman went undercover for six weeks, often
wired with a microphone, to help police nab the suspected drug
dealers who sold drugs to her daughters, authorities said.
   The woman, a 44-year-old bartender who asked that she be
identified only as Pat, helped break up a major methamphetamine
operation in Polk County on Wednesday, said Dallas Police Chief Jim
Harper.
   She said she wants her daughters, ages 24 and 21 and each with a
child of their own, to be prosecuted so they will be forced to get
drug treatment.
   The woman said she decided to speak about her experience because
``I've come to the conclusion that maybe if other people can see
somebody like me go in and do this, they might take the initiative
to do something.''
   The woman, who often wore a hidden microphone while she worked
undercover, was accompanied by police early Wednesday when she went
to Holman State Park west of Salem to sell chemicals to a suspect.
   Harper said 45 officers from six agencies later served search
warrants at three Polk County residences. They arrested five people
and seized one ounce of methamphetamine and several gallons of
chemicals used to manufacture the drug, he said.
   ``This lady really came through,'' Harper said. ``Talk about
being involved and making that sacrifice, she really did.''
   The woman said she decided to get involved because her daughters
use methamphetamine and were virtually living out of their cars.
   ``The people were getting all their money for drugs,'' the woman
said.
   She said she accompanied her daughters to a farm where they
allegedly purchased drugs and gave the address to Dallas police.
The department was aware of the farm but didn't have enough
evidence, she said.
   She began visiting the farm under the pretense that she was
looking for her daughters and became acquainted with people there
before offering to supply chemicals.
   ``I led them to believe I wanted to get into it because of the
money,'' she said.
   She said she was scared most of the time but used the
conversational skills learned as a bartender to ask the right
questions and get good information while she was wearing the hidden
microphone.
   ``I don't know how I pulled it off,'' she said. ``It amazes me.''

<HEAD>Settlement Approved In Ford Trust Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a year after auto tycoon
Henry Ford II's death, his family apparently has settled its
squabble over the $350 million trust he left behind.
   Following weeks of discussion among more than a dozen lawyers,
the Ford family hopes to move quickly from the public eye, said
Ford's son, Edsel Ford II.
   ``My father was a very personal man, as is the Ford family, and
my father would have found these proceedings very unpleasant,'' he
said. ``I'm just happy it's over.''
   The pact gives Ford's widow and third wife, Kathleen DuRoss
Ford, at least $10 million this year and a minimum of $1.5 million
in subsequent years. She also receives the couple's homes in Palm
Beach, Grosse Pointe, Mich., and London, and rights to purchase
three other Ford residences.
   The two-page accord approved Wednesday by Palm Beach Circuit
Judge Vaughn Rudnick appeared satisfactory to Mrs. Ford's foes in
the dispute, her stepson Edsel and her late husband's financial
adviser, William H. Donaldson.
   Donaldson, a New York investment banker, will receive $1 million
for his first year of service and $550,000 for the next two years.
He will resign after three years, according to the settlement.
   As the dispute was settled, Mrs. Ford was in England and Edsel
Ford was in Detroit.
   ``This means it's all put to bed,'' said Robert Montgomery, Mrs.
Ford's attorney. ``I think all parties are satisfied.''
   Attorneys disclosed some terms of the settlement Tuesday and
Edsel Ford confirmed details Wednesday.
   The settlement terms were far more generous to Mrs. Ford than
the provisions in the original trust.
   In the settlement, Mrs. Ford, 48, will receive an annual
allowance equal to 3 percent of the trust, Edsel Ford said. All
parties agreed to abide by that amount, he said.
   Ford's trust, signed May 17, 1984, guaranteed Mrs. Ford an
annual allowance of $1.5 million and any additional funds she
needed to maintain her lifestyle.
   Under the agreement, she said she would stop efforts to have
Donaldson removed as a trustee. Mrs. Ford objected to Donaldson
because he had asked for an annual salary of $1 million.
   Ford died at age 70 on Sept. 29, 1987, in Detroit. He filed his
will in Palm Beach County, his legal residence.

   Paul Nitze, President Reagan's special
adviser on arms control matters, has been awarded NATO's 1988
Atlantic Award for his consultations with America's allies during
the INF talks, NATO said today.
   The annual award, worth nearly $8,000, goes to Nitze for his
``outstanding contribution to the cohesiveness and strength of the
Western alliance,'' NATO said in a statement.
   He will receive the award at a ceremony at NATO headquarters at
an as yet unspecified date later this year.
   Nitze was selected by a a panel of NATO officials under the
chairmanship of Gabriel Robin, the French ambassador to the
16-nation Western alliance.
   It cited his efforts to brief America's allies on the Geneva
talks that produced the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty to remove hundreds of medium-range nuclear missiles
from Europe.
   His consultation efforts yielded ``unanimity of support and
cohesion for the final draft of the treaty among all NATO states,''
NATO said.
   ``This unity and cohesion...is essential to the Alliance
partnership for peace. The leadership exemplified by the commitment
of Ambassador Nitze and the high quality and number of his
contributions to the Alliance are precisely the elements that have
made the Allliance so successful in the last 40 years.''

<TEXT>
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer will soon be tooling around
town in a new custom limousine, but his opponents may get some
political mileage out of it as well.
   ``This kind of limousine is made for a sheik from Arabia,'' said
Alderman Lawrence Bloom, who will challenge Sawyer in next year's
special election.
   Alderman Edward Burke, another mayoral hopeful, dubbed Sawyer
``Limousine Gene.''
   The limousine, being assembled at a suburban Schaumburg plant,
will replace the city's 10-year-old protocol vehicle, said Howard
Saffold, chief of the mayor's security detail. But he and Sawyer
denied reports of a plush armor-plated vehicle.
   ``That would have cost between $60,000 and $90,000 ... We do not
have an armor-plated, bulletproof car. We can't afford it,'' Sawyer
said.
   Saffold said he didn't know the cost of the car, but that it had
an $8,000 security feature that he would not discuss.
   The new limo will supplement a $28,000 Cadillac Fleetwood sedan
purchased last year for the mayor's everyday use when a 1983 model
ran into maintaince problems, Saffold said.
   The new car, he said, will be used ``to hold kings and queens
from other countries, business people who are either doing business
with Chicago or anticipate doing business in Chicago.''
   During a radio taping Wednesday, Sawyer said his current car
broke down not long ago between appearances. ``I had to wait for
... for half an hour or 45 minutes,'' he said.
   Sawyer, who was made acting mayor in December following the
death of Harold Washington, also said he's getting a car that other
mayors have enjoyed.
   ``It occurs to me that if I'm correct (Richard J.) Daley had a
limousine; Jane Byrne had a limousine. Everybody else had a
limousine,'' he said.
   Asked why he can't use a smaller city car, Sawyer replied,
``Only one person can ride with me, and I don't know whether that's
appropriate for a city this size.''
   New York Mayor Ed Koch has a limousine; Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley is chauffeured in a city sedan.

<TEXT>
   The failure of the world's second-largest
diamond to sell at auction is no indication that the diamond market
is weakening, officials at Christie's auction house said.
   The flawless golden-hued diamond, weighing 407.48 carats and the
size of an egg, was withdrawn from the auction block by its owners
Wednesday after they rejected a record bid of $12 million,
officials said.
   It was the second time in as many days that a precious stone
expected to sell for a record amount was pulled off the block. On
Tuesday, Sotheby's was forced to withdraw the 48-carat royal red
Mandalay Ruby, which carried a pre-sale estimate of $15 million,
when a high bid of $7.6 million was rejected as insufficient by the
gem's owner.
   The giant diamond was offered for sale by New York jewelry
dealers Marvin Samuels and Louis Glick and the Zale Corp., a
Dallas-based jewelry retail chain. Zale purchased it as an uncut
890-carat stone in August 1984.
   The $12 million bid, the highest ever at an auction for a gem,
was made by Theodore Horovitz, a Geneva-based jeweler, according to
Christie's.
   ``The fact that the diamond didn't find a buyer is no reflection
on the state of the diamond market, which is extremely strong,''
Francis Curiel, head of Christie's jewelry department, said in a
statement.
   The gem was described as the largest ever offered at a public
auction. It is second in size only to the 530.20-carat Cullinan I,
which is set in Britain's Imperial Sceptre as part of the Crown
Jewels.
   Christie's had resisted estimating how much the diamond would
bring, although Curiel noted that an 85.91-carat white diamond was
auctioned April 19 for $9.31 million _ a record for any gem.

   Iran has rejected an Iraqi plan for
repatriating prisoners of war from the Persian Gulf conflict,
Tehran radio said today.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Iran's parliament
speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, as saying Iraq must accept a United
Nations-sponsored plan for ending the eight-year war before
prisoner exchanges can start.
   According to the Red Cross, Iran has 50,182 prisoners and Iraq
has 19,284 prisoners. But U.N. officials and diplomats in Iran and
Iraq believe Iran holds 60,000 to 70,000 POWs and Iraq 30,000 to
50,000.
   ``Iraq not doubt realizes the only way to have the prisoners of
war released is not to obstruct U.N. Resolution 598, and if the
Iraqi regime had accepted peace negotiations more than half the
prisoners would have been released by now,'' Rafsanjani was quoted
as telling the House.
   U.N. Resolution 598 calls for an immediate cease-fire,
withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundaries and
the exchange of prisoners.
   Iraq earlier this week proposed to the International Red Cross
and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that
repatriation of prisoners should begin on humanitarian grounds if
Iran reciprocates.
   But Iraq also made it clear that its offer was unrelated to
peace negotiations, which stalled five days after a cease-fire was
declared in the Iran-Iraq war on Aug. 20.
   Rafsanjani was quoted as saying Iran is willing to ``release the
prisoners of war as soon as possible, but in the framework of
Resolution 598.''
   Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Ja'afar
Mahallati, said in New York on Wednesday that technical issues on
prisoner exchanges must be settled within the framework of the U.N.
resolution. He also said Iran wants withdrawal to internationally
recognized borders to be the next step.
   The peace talks have deadlocked over Iraq's insistence that the
disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms its southern border
with Iran, should be cleared of silt and ships sunk early in the
war.
   Iran has rejected the dredging demand, saying it is a secondary
issue that can be settled later in the negotiations.

   President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi
appointed a member of the majority Hutu people prime minister,
Radio Burundi reported today.
   Adrien Simbomana was appointed on Wednesday, about two months
after 5,000 people were killed in fighting between the Hutu and the
Tutsi, the East African nation's dominant ethnic minority.
   Simbomana's 23-member Cabinet is dominated by the Hutu, who hold
13 portfolios. The Tutsi hold 10.
   The state-owned radio, monitored in Nairobi, said Buyoya, a
Tutsi, remained defense minister, a position he held in the
previous government. The powerful post of interior minister went to
Lt. Col. Aloys Kadoyi, another Tutsi.
   Simbomana is a former deputy speaker of the National Assembly
under ousted President Jean-Batiste Bagaza. He is the governor of
Muramvya Province and was recently appointed vice president of the
commission charged with studying the problem of national unity.
   The violence began Aug. 14 when Hutu attacked Tutsi living among
them in the north, hacking hundreds to death with machetes and
burning people alive in huts.
   Soldiers of the Tutsi-dominated military sent to restore order
attacked the Hutu after seeing what had happened to fellow Tutsi.
More than 40,000 people, mainly Hutu, fled to Rwanda, Burundi's
northern neighbor.
   Hutu comprise about 84 percent of Burundi's 5 million people and
the Tutsi 15 percent. The Tutsi have controlled the government and
the military since the tiny landlocked former Belgian colony gained
independence in July 1962.
   Ethnic problems date from the 15th century when the Tutsi, a
tall, Nilotic people, migrated from Ethiopia and imposed feudal
rule on the short, stocky Hutu living in communes.
   Under Belgian rule, the Tutsi maintained their dominant role and
at independence formed the government.
   In 1972, the Hutu tried to overthrow the government, beginning
with a massacre of hundreds of Tutsi. The rebellion was crushed and
the government retaliated by killing between 100,000 and 300,000
Hutu, including most of the tribe's intelligensia, according to
human rights groups.
   Buyoya, in a recent tour of the country's 114 districts, said
last week that some Burundians still harbor ethnic animosity and
want to avenge the August massacres.
   ``Whoever is caught sowing seeds of animosity in any part of the
country will receive severe punishment,'' Buyoya said on Oct. 15.
   Buyoya, 41, seized power in a Sept. 3, 1987, in a bloodless
military coup that toppled Bagaza's 10-year-old government. Bagaza,
a Tutsi, was attending a Francophone summit in Canada.

   A fire swept through a large oil refinery
in northern Taiwan today, causing severe damage to the plant and
forcing it to close, officials said. One worker was slightly
injured.
   The fire, which was caused by a leaking pump, occurred at the
state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp., 30 miles west of Taipei, and did
an estimated $6.9 million in damage, company officials said.
   The blaze forced the evacuation of thousands of people living
near the plant and was put out in three hours by firefighters
assisted by helicopters.
   The refinery will be closed for about two months to replace the
equipment destroyed by the fire, officials said.
   The plant produces 30,000 barrels of low sulfur fuel a day, or
about 10 percent of total consumption in Taiwan.
   Kuan Yung-shih, president of Chinese Petroleum, told reporters
his company will increase fuel production at its other refinery in
southern Taiwan and resort to emergency imports to meet the fuel
demands.

   Thousands of Serbs jeered Communist
Party leaders today and turned their backs on Politburo members who
tried to speak during a rally in the ethnically troubled province
of Kosovo.
   Taunts of ``Thieves!'' and ``You betrayed the people!'' greeted
Politburo members Marko Orlandic and Kasura Jasari, Kosovo's
Communist Party head, when they arrived to address the Serbs in
Kosovo Polje, a suburb of the Kosovo capital of Pristina.
   The Serbs are unhappy at the outcome of a three-day Central
Committee meeting which, they say, did little to solve the
country's ethnic and economic crisis.
   Students in Kosovo, an autonomous province in the republic of
Serbia, boycotted classes to express their dissatisfaction with the
meeting. The boycott was staged by Slavs, who include both Serbs
and ethnic Montenegrins.
   The rally began with about 5,000 Serbs waving flags, singing
national songs and chanting, ``Central Committee members, you have
shown your true face!''
   At the Central Committee meeting in Belgrade, which ended
Wednesday, a Serbian member of the Poliburo failed to win a vote of
confidence from committee members. It was a blow to the Serbs'
fight for greater control over Kosovo.
   Dusan Ckrebic was the only one of 10 Politburo members facing
the vote who could not muster a majority from the 165-member
Central Committee. He has offered to resign.
   National party chief Stipe Suvar said it was the first time a
member of the Politburo had failed to win such a vote.
   When Orlandic and Jasari arrived, the crowd booed and jeered. At
least one stone was hurled at the podium, but it missed.
   Protesters had hoped the Central Committee would take steps to
protect Kosovo's minority Serbs and Montenegrins from alleged
harassment by the majority Albanians.
   The crowd gathered in a large school field and literally turned
its back on Orlandic and Jasari, moving away from the podium to the
far side of the field.
   After about 15 minutes, local party officials persuaded about
half the crowd to go back to the podium, but the other half left.
   Many in the crowd carried pictures of Serbia's Communist Party
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, and waved Serbian and Communist Party
flags as they sang national songs and chanted, ``Kosovo is
Serbia!'' and ``A strong Serbia is a strong Yugoslavia!''
   Milosevic's drive to impose more Serbian control over Kosovo has
angered fellow Communist leaders. They fear he is using popular
emotion to increase the influence of Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest
ethnic group, in national affairs.
   A Milosevic supporter, Politburo member Vasil Tuporkovski,
implied these leaders had acted in tandem to deliver a blow to
Milosevic by making Ckrebic lose the confidence vote. Ckerbic, a
close ally of Milosevic, received only 68 votes in the secret
ballot. He needed 83.
   An ``unprincipled coalition'' was behind the action, Tuporkovski
said. His charge was reported today by Serbian media.
   Serbs have threatened to leave Kosovo if they are not given more
control over the province, which borders Albania. Ethnic Albanians
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million population.
   Protesters are also unhappy with Yugoslavia's economic
situation, which is at its worst point since World War II.
Inflation was 217 percent over the past 12 months, unemployment is
15 percent, and the foreign debt is $21 billion.

<HEAD>City Council To Consider Curb On Racial, Sexual Slurs By Aldermen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council will consider a resolution
asking aldermen to stop using racial slurs and ethnic or gender
insults, but during a hearing on the measure some aldermen found it
difficult to avoid insulting witnesses.
   The council's Rules Committee on Wednesday approved a proposal
that would establish guidelines for debate and questioning of
witnesses during council committee meetings to assure people of
fair hearings ``without fear of persecution or harassment.''
   Dem Hopkins, the owner of a North Side gay bar, accused some
aldermen of harming the gay community by referring ``to human
beings who happen to be gay as animals and sissies'' during a
recent fight over a proposed human rights ordinance.
   That drew a sharp retort from Alderman George Hagopian, an
outspoken opponent of gay rights legislation.
   ``Do you mean to tell me if I see someone who walks like a duck,
talks like a duck, and acts like a duck, I can't call it that?''
Hagopian asked.
   Hopkins' reply _ ``You call it a person, alderman'' _ was
interrupted by the committee chairwoman, Alderwoman Anna Langford,
who chided Hagopian for being out of order.
   The resolution to curb aldermen's language was introduced by
Alderwoman Kathy Osterman who was upset about the way some aldermen
badgered nominees to the police and school boards on their
religious backgrounds and the derivation of their last name's in
recent hearings.
   The proposed resolution would bar council members from engaging
in irrelevant and inappropriate questioning of witnesses about
their religious preferences, gender, ethnic or cultural backgrounds.
   One alderman, Robert Shaw, complained the proposal would only
``hamstring'' the council's work.
   The full council will consider the measure next week.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors arrested a former real estate company
executive today for allegedly trying to bribe a lawmaker
investigating an insider trading scandal involving the firm,
Justice Ministry officials said.
   Hiroshi Matsubara, 47, a former top aide to the head of
Recruit-Cosmos Co., was charged with offering cash to Yonosuke
Narazaki of the opposition Social Democratic Alliance, officials
said.
   Prosecutors said Matsubara offered Narazaki the money to cover
up the company's sale of unlisted stock to top politicians and
business leaders who sold the shares after the stock jumped in
value in a public offering.
   Authorities said Matsubara brought a candy box containing
$38,000 to Narazaki on three occasions in August and September and
asked him to relax his investigation.
   One attempt last month was filmed by a Tokyo television network
that Narazaki allowed into his home.
   ``Please save Recruit,'' Matsubara told Narazaki in the footage,
which Nippon Television Network has broadcast repeatedly during
newscasts. ``We understand politics cost money. We intend to
support you for the rest of your political career.''
   Narazaki refused to accept the money and filed a complaint last
month with the Tokyo District Prosecutors' Office against
Matsubara, Recruit-Cosmos President Tomoyuki Ikeda, and Hiromasa
Ezoe, founder of the parent Recruit Co. Ezoe resigned his post
immediately after the scandal broke in July.
   On Wednesday, prosecutors searched the offices of the two
companies and Matsubara's residence and confiscated more than 1,000
boxes of documents.
   ``We believe there are several other conspirators in the
scheme,'' Yasuchika Negoro, director of the Criminal Justice
Department at the Justice Ministry, told Parliament today.
   It was the first time prosecutors entered the scandal.
   ``The gate of the Recruit scandal has just opened,'' Narazaki
told reporters, referring to the Watergate scandal that led to the
downfall of President Nixon in August 1974.
   The insider trading scandal surfaced last summer when it was
disclosed that dozens of politicians, business leaders and
journalists acquired and sold shares in Recruit-Cosmos.
   Trading stock on privileged information has been a common
practice in Japan, but new laws passed since the scandal unfolded
deal more stringently with insider trading.

   A high school student who wore a
packaged condom as an earring was sent home by school officials who
said his unusual jewelry caused a disruption.
   Janesville Parker High School senior Jeff Rabiola said he
dangled the condom from his ear Tuesday to encourage classmates to
use birth control.
   ``Some laughed, and some said it was immature, disgusting and
gross,'' he said. ``But it's only immature if you don't use
condoms, and it's AIDS that's disgusting and gross.''
   After refusing a teacher's suggestion that he remove the
earring, Rabiola was sent to the administration office, he said.
   Assistant Principal Joel Moore, who said he doubted Rabiola's
sincerity, said the student was asked to leave school because the
unusual jewelry caused a disruption.
   Rabiola returned to school Wednesday _ without his earring _ and
no further action was planned, Moore said.

<TEXT>
   Republican Dan Quayle promised jobs and
economic prosperity as he courted Reagan Democrats today in the
hotly contested campaign for votes in industrial Ohio.
   In a speech to 1,000 students at Marietta College, GOP nominee
George Bush's vice presidential running mate said the Reagan
administration had created 12 million new jobs, and rejected
suggested they were low-paying.
   ``It adds up to a job for all who want to work,'' Quayle said.
   He said that for the first time ever, the government stands
ready to keep its promise of full employment.
   Campaign aides said Quayle would hammer away at the jobs theme
during a day-long tour through eastern Ohio.
   Spokesman David Prosperi said polls _ which he did not identify
_ showed Bush with a narrow lead over Democratic rival Michael
Dukakis in Ohio, and that Quayle's job today was to expand that
lead by stressing ``jobs, jobs and more jobs.''
   Quayle planned appearances in McConnelsville, Zanesville and
Newark, Ohio, before heading south Friday to Tennessee and Georgia.
   In rural Missouri on Wednesday, Quayle assailed Dukakis as
``dangerous and naive'' and having different values than those,
like himself, who come from the Middle West.
   Much of Quayle's regional pitch centers on family issues, but he
broadened his appeal to include defense policy as the campaign
begins a television campaign on the same theme.
   In a speech to college students in Liberty, Mo., Quayle asked if
``you really want the person that's going to sit across from the
General Secretary (Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev) to be a
liberal governor?''
   Dukakis' views on defense, Quayle said, are ``dangerous and
naive'' because he ``would unilaterally give up U.S. advantages
before even sitting down with the Soviets.''
   The speech was a toughening of the rhetoric that aides went out
of their way to underscore to reporters.
   Working to paint a picture of a relaxed and confident campaign,
Quayle even made a surprise stop at a barbecue restaurant in
Independence, Mo., to personally pick out three huge platters of
ribs for reporters traveling with him. He put down two crisp $100
bills to pay the check.
   He also said he'll be taking the weekend off, though the
election is less than three weeks away.
   ``So we don't make any mistakes those last two weeks,'' Quayle
said. ``Don't want to get tired and mess up. Might possibly cost
you to lose the election.
   ``I'm being cautious. It's also called going home,'' he said.
   Quayle had opened his campaign day in Chicago where he held
closed-door meetings with Jewish supporters.
   He emerged from the meetings saying Republicans are shooting for
a ``clear majority'' from that traditionally Democratic voting
group.
   ``Evidently we haven't done as good a job as we should have in
communicating where the Republican Party stands vis a vis Israel,
where the Republican Party stands vis a vis the Jewish community,''
Quayle said.
   Quayle ended his campaign day with a rally in Parkersburg, W.
Va., where he was greeted by protesters chanting ``coward'' and
``chickenhawk,'' referring to his National Guard service at the
height of the Vietnam War.
   ``Is that a Dukakis supporter out there?'' asked Quayle. ``If I
had to support Dukakis, I'd yell, too.''

<TEXT>
   Two tenacious brothers-in-law used
$400 de-icers to enlarge the breathing holes of three stranded
whales, accomplishing in hours what it had taken a day for workers
in the $500,000 rescue effort to do.
   Greg Ferrian and Rick Skluzacek, of Lakeland, Minn., flew to
Alaska at their own expense Wednesday when rescue coordinators
politely rejected their offer to bring in the device, used to free
boats in frozen marinas.
   Early today, under the skeptical supervision of the rescuers,
they used six small de-icers to clear ice and slush from the two
breathing holes the California gray whales have been using since
becoming trapped last week.
   The cylindrical devices, about 9 inches around and 14 inches
long, churn up warm water from below the surface to melt the ice.
   Eskimo whalers and other volunteers have labored with chain
saws, pickaxes and steel bars to keep the holes open, but in a
matter of hours, the devices had accomplished what took all day to
do by hand.
   Ferrian said he first learned of the whales' plight Monday night
while watching the televised struggle to keep the breathing holes
open.
   ``It looked to me like a hard way to go about it, and I had an
easier way,'' he said. Ferrian called his brother-in-law, Skluzacek.
   ``He was thinking the same thing,'' Ferrian said.
   He immediately began calling rescue coordinators in Alaska, but
as with numerous other, often impractical well-wishers, the offer
was politely brushed off. Other suggestions that have been rejected
included dropping everything from explosives to bowling balls
through the ice.
   Lying in bed that night, Ferrian became more and more convinced
he had a solution.
   ``My wife kept pushing me on the deal. She said, `If you feel
that strongly about it, go for it.'''
   The two said they spent about $5,000 to make the trip to Barrow.
   ``Once we got to the airports and people found out what the
equipment was for, it was pretty much a free ride for the
machines,'' Ferrian said.
   After meeting with rescue officials Wednesday afternoon, they
got their chance.
   ``It wasn't costing us anything, and they were here, so we
figured, `Why not?''' said Ron Morris, a National Marine Fisheries
Service biologist in charge of the rescue operation.
   Working in the pre-dawn dark in subzero temperatures, they
hooked up a portable generator and put the machines to work.
   The question of whether the de-icers would disturb the already
stressed whales was quickly answered. Within minutes, the whales
surfaced just two feet from the devices, which hum like a sewing
machine and spew a jet of water similar to a Jacuzzi.
   The de-icer, or water agitator, floats in the water suspended
beneath a styrofoam slab. A small, double-blade propeller pulls
warmer water up from below and emits it with 34 pounds of thrust.
   Unlike most liquids, which become denser as they cool, water
becomes lighter below 38 degrees Fahrenheit, six degrees above
freezing, Skluzacek explained. As a result, warmer water sinks and
cooler water rises to the surface and freezes.
   ``We've sold thousands of them _ not for whales, but for
boats,'' Ferrian said.
   The devices are used in marinas to keep boats from becoming
frozen, and they've been used in places like Lake Superior, where
the weather can be as severe as in the Arctic, he said.
   The device was developed about 15 years ago by Skluzacek's
father, Bill, and the family owned business in Lakeland, Minn., a
St. Paul suburb, has been refining it ever since.
   Skluzacek said that within 24 hours, the breathing holes should
be about 30 feet by 70 feet _ three or four times the original size.
   That won't free the whales but it should help buy time.
   North Slope Borough veterinarian Tom Albert said earlier
expansion of the breathing holes reduced stress on the animals,
which for a time almost had to shoulder their way to the surface to
breath.
   Borough biologists Craig George and Geoff Carroll admitted they
were among the skeptics.
   ``So far, it's performing far better than I expected,'' George
said, watching the hole grow in the light of a snowmachine
headlight.
   ``When they first came in the office, I thought we had a couple
of crackpots,'' Carroll admitted. ``I really admire those guys'
pluck, knowing they had just the right equipment for the job and
having the guts to come up here and prove it.''

   An Indian Airlines jet made an emergency
landing today, officials said, a day after two airline crashes
killed 165 people.
   Investigators were not ruling out sabotage as the cause of the
crashes, a government official said. ``Two crashes on the same day
in two hours is too much of a coincidence,'' said the official, who
is closely associated with the investigation into Wednesday's
disasters.
   An Indian Airlines Airbus carrying 209 people made an emergency
landing shortly after takeoff today from the southern city of
Madras, airline officials in New Delhi said. The plane, bound for
Singapore, apparently developed technical problems, they said, but
did not elaborate.
   On Wednesday, a Boeing 737 operated by Indian Airlines crashed
while trying to land in heavy fog at Ahmadabad airport in central
India. The plane clipped a tree, struck a power line and exploded
on its final approach.
   All but five of the 135 people on board died.
   Less than two hours after the disaster, a 30-year-old Fokker
Friendship propeller plane leased by Indian Airlines to another
domestic carrier, Vayudoot, slammed into a hill in eastern India
during a severe rainstorm.
   J.C. Barua, a senior official of Vayudoot in Guwahati, confirmed
today that all 31 passengers and four crew members died. All were
Indians.
   The United News of India news agency quoted one villager as
saying the plane caught fire and exploded before crashing.
   The causes of the crashes were not immediately known. Both
planes lost radio contact shortly before crashing, and airline
officials said they suspected technical malfunctions.
   The government owns Indian Airlines, Vayadoot and Air-India,
which operates only on international routes.
   Federal Aviation Minister Shiv Raj Patial has ordered
investigations into the crashes.
   ``These two things have happened on the same day. There, I am
keeping my fingers crossed whether it is a mere coincidence or some
design,'' he was quoted as saying in the The Hindustan Times.
   Indian Airlines Flight 131 was flying from Bombay to Ahmadabad
with 129 passengers and six crew members when it went down.
   Indian Airlines has come under fire for allegedly failing to
maintain safety procedures and to adequately supervise its pilots.
Wednesday's crash was the carrier's 16th major accident in its
26-year history.
   One airline official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the pilot may have confused floodlights at a construction site for
the runway.
   A recording between the pilot and the Ahmadabad control tower
gave no indication of trouble, authorities said.
   Survivor Paag Vasavda, 28, said the pilot told passengers he was
having trouble landing in the fog. Vasavda said he heard two
explosions.
   ``Afterward, the plane broke apart,'' he said.
   The passenger manifest said victims included two Japanese, three
Germans and an industrialist from Bahrain.
   The Fokker Friendship crashed into a 1,400-foot hill near
Guwahati airport, about 960 miles east of New Delhi. It was nearing
the end of a flight from Silchar.
   The plane reported zero visibility, then lost contact with the
Guwahati control tower two minutes before the crash, said C. Das,
civil administrator for Guwahati district.

<HEAD>Feds To Give Elderly Free Shots Under Test Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of elderly Americans will receive free
flu vaccinations this year under a test program that could lead to
free shots for all the nation's Medicare recipients, according to
published reports.
   Federal health officials call the $50 million program an
unprecedented preventative effort that could prolong thousands of
lives, The Atlanta Constitution and The New York Times reported
today. The elderly are considered most at risk for fatal flu
complications, but Medicare does not now cover the shots.
   Federal officials are expected to announce next week the six to
10 sites nationwide that will be the first to receive federal
funding for the shots.
   They hope the special program can inoculate 4 million to 8
million people annually against influenza. About 22 million
Americans now regularly receive flu shots.
   The program will be administered by the Atlanta-based Centers
for Disease Control and the federal Health Care Financing
Administration.
   CDC epidemiologist Dr. Nancy Arden said the sites may include
nursing homes, hospitals, state and county health departments,
medical schools or other programs for elderly Americans, to
determine the most cost-effective way to reach the most senior
citizens.
   The program, authorized last year by Congress, gives health
officials up to four years to demonstrate the value of influenza
shots for the elderly. Health officials have been concerned that
only 20 percent of the nation's elderly get yearly flu shots.
   If the test program proves cost-effective, by cutting the cost
of treating people who become sick with influenza, flu inoculation
will be covered for all the nation's 32 million Medicare recipients.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would cost
Medicare $39 million a year to immunize all recipients against
influenza.
   Officials estimate that flu costs the country more than $1
billion annually for hospitalization and up to 10 times that much
for other costs, including doctors' visits and lost work time.
   Flu and pneumonia, its most common complication, together are
the leading cause of death from infectious disease in the United
States, contributing to about 68,000 deaths each year. Between 80
percent and 90 percent of those deaths occur in people over 65.
   In years of epidemics, officials say, the number of flu deaths
can exceed 50,000.
   The American Lung Association recommended this week that elderly
people and children and adults who live with them get annual shots
to reduce the risk of outbreaks. In the past, the association had
recommended annual flu shots only for elderly Americans and people
who are chronically ill.

<HEAD>Children's TV Bill Passes, But Reagan Veto Likely</HEAD>

   Some television stations would have to reduce
advertising and refocus their children's programming efforts under
a bill approved by Congress and hailed as ``a victory for America's
children.''
   The measure won final passage on a voice vote in the Senate on
Wednesday, but the Reagan administration opposes it and the Justice
Department recommends that he veto it on constitutional grounds.
   The measure would limit advertising time during children's shows
and require TV stations to provide informative programming for
children as a condition of license renewal.
   Supporters say the legislation is the most important statement
by Congress on children's television in a generation.
   ``This legislation will challenge broadcasters to educate
children creatively rather than to exploit children commercially,''
said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., a co-author of the measure.
   Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television,
called passage of the bill ``a landmark victory for parents and
children.''
   ``What this bill does is create a new climate in broadcasting
and signals a sea change in the way broadcasters and the FCC
(Federal Communications Commission) will view children's
programming,'' said Charren, whose Cambridge, Mass.-based group has
lobbied for 20 years to set into law advertising limits for
children's shows.
   But the administration opposes the bill as ``inimical to the
spirit of the First Amendment'' because it injects the government
into programming and advertising decisions of TV stations. The
Justice Department recommended a veto on constitutional grounds
following House passage, 328-78, in June.
   The legislation would break from the course of the Reagan
administration's efforts to deregulate the broadcast industry. The
FCC lifted its children's TV commercial limits four years ago.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said the legislation was ``both
unnecessary and ill-advised,'' particularly because the FCC has
been considering taking action related to the commercialization of
children's television.
   The FCC abandoned its advertising limits on the theory that
commercial content during children's shows would be best regulated
by the open marketplace.
   But children's TV advocates said the FCC's philosophy of
deregulation was harming children. They said that since the imits
were dropped in 1984, stations have increased advertising during
children's shows and the quality of children's programming has
deteriorated as toy manufacturers have become heavily involved in
developing shows based on their products.
   Markey said reimposing advertising limits ``will help stem the
creeping commercialism presently plaguing children's television.''
   Stations would be allowed no more than 10{ minutes per hour of
advertising in kids' shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on
weekdays. Stations would have until Jan. 1, 1990, to comply with
the advertising limits. The FCC would be authorized to modify the
time standards after Jan. 1, 1993.
   George Schweitzer, CBS communications vice president, said the
network now has 9.5 minutes of commercials per hour in its weekend
children's shows, with an additional minute of time sold by the
affiliate stations.
   Critics of TV commercials say some shows have up to 16.5 minutes
of commercials in an hour.
   The measure also would require stations to ``serve the
educational and informational needs of children'' in overall
programming and would require the FCC to evaluate those efforts
every five years when a station applies for renewal of its license.
   The National Association of Broadcasters did not oppose the bill
``because we share the interests of Congress in assuring the
provision of programs that serve the needs of the child audience,''
according to spokeswoman Susan Kraus.
   ``In a small way it does legislate content and that would always
be a concern of ours, but because it does it in such a small way we
thought it was worth it to live with this bill,'' she said.
   Martin Franks, a CBS vice president, said, ``Clearly it's going
to require us to rethink some of the ways we've done our business
but it's a compromise we were a part of and more than willing to
accept.''
   ``It will result in some cutbacks in advertising,'' he added,
but declined to estimate how much.
   The compromise legislation was stripped of proposals that would
prohibit programs that feature toy manufacturers' products,
referred to by critics as ``program-length commercials.''
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., who favored such an approach, said the
measure that was passed begins to address the issue but doesn't go
far enough.
   His chief complaint is that it does not explicitly require
programming specifically designed for children. Rather, the bill
simply says children's interests must be served through
broadcasters' ``overall programming efforts.''
   Broadcasters ``certainly could argue that family-oriented shows
such as `The Cosby Show' are of benefit to children and such
programming efforts would satisfy the requirements of this
legislation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Engineers Will Assess Impact of Engine Leak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the three main engines on space shuttle
Discovery developed a leak when it lifted off from the Kennedy
Space Center in Florida on Sept. 29, NASA said today.
   ``The leak was on a line between the combustion chamber and the
nozzle,'' said Karl Kristofferson, a space agency spokesman at Cape
Canaveral. ``It started near where the nozzle joins the bell
housing.''
   The problem was not noticed at the time, but engineers now are
re-examining flight data for any telltale signs. The leak was found
during a routine check of Discovery's engines while the shuttle is
being prepared for its next flight in February.
   Kristofferson said engineers do not believe the leak will have
any impact on the next flight, that of Atlantis, scheduled for
around Thanksgiving.
   ``We don't know whether the problem indicates a generic failure
or whether Discovery's engine can be fixed or must be replaced,''
he said. ``The parts were welded together before launch, leading
officials to believe the leak developed during ascent.''
   The engine had not been dissasembled and Kristofferson said
engineers did not know how serious the problem was or what its
consequences might have been for the flight.
   The shuttle completed its four-day, one-hour mission _ the first
since the Challenger accident in 1986 _ without a hitch, landing at
Edwards Air Force Base in California.

   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen vowed today to
``take them on'' and answer every negative Republican campaign
advertisement, despite his acknowledged risk that the fight-back
strategy might obscure the Democrats' broader message.
   ``I'm going to take myself on an assignment,'' he told workers
at a huge General Electric appliance plant here. ``Every time they
issue a falsehood ... I'm going to take them on and straighten that
one out.''
   Bentsen said the presidential campaign should be fought over
issues like health, housing and America's economic future. But he
said the Republicans instead were distorting the prison furlough
issue and lying about Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' position
on gun controls.
   Bentsen, a World War II veteran, said he took it ``as a personal
insult to me'' that the Republicans were trying to portray Dukakis
as weak on defense.
   ``We have seen the Republicans running on symbols and twisting
the facts,'' said Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential
candidate.
   ``We're going to tell them that you can't devalue the currency
of our democracy,'' he said.
   Bentsen spoke after touring the dishwasher plant that is part of
a giant GE complex employing more than 13,000 people. He shook
hands with workers and viewed robot equipment that has helped boost
plant productivity and profits.
   Bentsen told reporters Wednesday that the GOP's negative
campaign ads were ``an outrage.''
   He cited the script of a new commercial featuring Dukakis riding
in a battle tank and claiming that the Massachusetts governor
opposed every new defense program, which Bentsen said was
``completely untrue.''
   From Louisville, Bentsen headed for Texas to take part in an
hour-long national student satellite teleconference from Corpus
Christi State University.
   In the teleconference, Bentsen will answer questions from
students from 26 colleges in 11 states. Those scheduled to
participate at campuses around the country included the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee at Memphis State and former
Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins at the University of Kentucky.
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton was to serve as moderator.
   Although Bentsen says he'd rather spend his time discussing home
ownership, trade, education, and other Democratic issues, he
conceded those messages were not yet getting through. His attack
lines, meanwhile, are proving popular at rallies where the crowds
seem more pumped up than before.
   A Louisville crowd roared Wednesday night when Bentsen described
his opinion of how the Republicans have distorted Dukakis' record.
``Down in Texas, we'd say they painted him lower than a snake's
belly in a wagon rut,'' he said.
   Bentsen met briefly with reporters on Wednesday before leaving
California, where he unveiled his new tactics. He acknowledged the
Republican campaign was working and it showed in the polls.
   ``That's why I finally had enough, because apparently these kind
of charges when they're not answered, even though they are as
ludicrous as they are, have some damaging effect,'' he said.
   ``I'm not going to put up with it any more,'' he said. ``I'm
going to take them head on every time they distort the truth''
through election day.
   ``This is my idea,'' Bentsen said. ``This is not something I was
asked to do.''

<TEXT>
  Officials from Southeast Asian nations
failed today to agree on a plan to end the 10-year-old Cambodian
conflict, but participants pledged to meet in December to try again.
   The main stumbling block at the four-day meeting was Vietnam's
insistence on linking its promised troop pullout from Cambodia to
preventing the Khmer Rouge from returning to power and ending arms
aid to the Cambodian guerrillas.
   Other demands by Vietnam included a timetable for the pullout
and an international body to supervise and control it, said the
chairman of the group of Southeast Asian representatives, John P.
Louhanapessy.
   Louhanapessy, director general for political affairs in
Indonesia's foreign ministry, said the group will meet again Dec.
12-14 in Jakarta and possibly a third time in January.
   The representatives are from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations along with Vietnam, Laos and the warring factions of
Cambodia. ASEAN comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Brunei, Singapore and Thailand.
   The Khmer Rouge, who massacred hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians during their 1975-1978 rule, were absent from this
week's talks.
   Louhanapessy said the guerrilla group sent word it could not
attend because almost all its staff were at the United Nations. But
diplomatic sources said the Khmer Rouge boycotted the meeting
because of ASEAN's opposition to their return to power after
Vietnam withdraws all its troops as promised by 1990.
   Louhanapessy said he hoped the Khmer Rouge would attend in
December.

   A defendant in a murder trial was
mistakenly handcuffed to a key prosecution witness and the two
scuffled after being left alone in a sheriff's department van,
officials said.
   ``I find this difficult to understand how such a regrettable
breach of security could have happened,'' Circuit Judge Lawrence
Glazer said.
   Glazer on Tuesday ordered an immediate investigation into how
the two men could be placed in the same sheriff's department van,
let alone be handcuffed together.
   ``There was an oversight,'' said Ingham County Sheriff Capt.
Richard Abbott.
   The suspect, Jonathan Sheppard, and the witness, Kelly Whitt,
who is a cousin of the murder victim, started fighting as soon as
they were left unguarded. Both sustained minor injuries.
   Whitt, a prisoner at the Western Wayne Correctional Facility in
Pontiac, testified Monday and Tuesday. He is one of only two men
who can place Sheppard at the slaying scene, even though Sheppard
has admitted he shot John Wright during a drug deal that went sour
on April 29.
   Authorities usually transport defendants and witnesses, who are
in custody, in separate vehicles. Abbott said court deputies in
Lansing failed to tell transport officers that the two men had to
be separated.
   Deputies had to subdue Whitt, although it was unclear who
started the fight.

   Thousands fled the Caribbean coast
of Central America today as Hurricane Joan closed in with heavy
rains and 115 mph winds, threatening to unleash a torrent of flash
floods and mud slides.
   The storm, which was moving west after leaving 35 people dead or
missing in Colombia and thousands homeless, stalled this morning
over the ocean, but heavy rains associated with the storm lashed
Costa Rica.
   Gilbert Clark, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in
Coral Gables, Fla., said flash floods and mud slides could cause
severe damage in the mountainous regions of Central America.
   ``Unfortunately, they are getting a lot of rain ahead of this
storm, which is going to affect the area and cause a lot of mud
slides and flash flood in the mountains,'' he said. ``The biggest
threat to life will be from flash floods and mud slides.''
   Max Mayfield, another forecaster at the hurricane center, said
the portion of the Caribbean where the hurricane is bound has never
experienced a storm of such magnitude.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Joan's center was located near latitude 11.2
north, longitude 79.7 west, or about 265 miles southeast of
Bluefields, Nicaragua. The hurricane was stationary this morning
but was expected to resume a slow westward motion later today.
   Maximum sustained winds were 115 mph.
   The Colombian islands of San Andres, Albuquerque and Providencia
were under a hurricane warning, and a watch was posted for the
Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
   A nationwide state of alert was declared in Nicaragua, and
schools were closed across the country. Early today, about 5,000
people were evacuated from remote coastal regions, said Information
Minister Manuel Espinoza.
   At least 12,000 people fled Puerto Limon, Costa Rica's main
Caribbean port, and other northeast coastal towns, said Johnny
Alfaro, national emergency committee director in Puerto Limon.
   ``We're sure of one thing: Hurricane Joan will provoke many
floods along the Atlantic coast and to a lesser degree on the
Pacific coast,'' Alfaro said.
   Hundreds of people lined up for buses to flee the town of 10,000
located 100 miles southeast of San Jose, the capital. Some said
they were afraid there wouldn't be enough transportation for
everyone.
   ``We could die,'' said Alfaro Valverde, 58, as he waited in line.
   Public Security Minister Hernan Garron said 1,000 police were
sent to Puerto Limon to prevent looting.
   In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega declared a state of alert
Wednesday night.
   ``If the hurricane fully strikes national territory it could
cause severe damages,'' Agriculture Minister Jaime Wheelock told
The Associated Press.
   ``Our priority is to save lives,'' he said. ``We're prepared for
war, but not against hurricanes.''
   Civil Defense officials in Nicaragua said that they had enough
emergency supplies only for ``immediate needs.'' They said the
7-year war with the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras has drained
their reserves.
   State-run Voice of Nicaragua radio set up a new channel for news
on the hurricane so it could broadcast Wednesday night's World
Series game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Oakland
Athletics.
   ``If the hurricane stays over water, it is possible its full
force will hit Bluefields Thursday morning or Friday morning. It
could be a disaster because most of the buildings there are of
wood,'' said Alejo Moreno, head of the Nicaraguan weather service.
   Bluefields is on a remote stretch of the Miskito Coast about 180
miles east of Managua, the capital.
   Joan swept across Colombia's Guajira Peninsula as a tropical
storm Monday and became a hurricane Tuesday. It killed 15, left 20
missing, injured 50 and flooded or destroyed the homes of 27,000
people, Colombia's National Emergency Committee said Wednesday.
   Joan is the fifth hurricane of the Atlantic season. In
September, Hurricane Gilbert left more than 300 people dead and
caused widespread damage in Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican
Republic and the Cayman Islands.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis have resorted to what the
Republican calls ``silly things,'' from exchanging stares with the
Three Little Pigs to riding an M-1 tank, to get the ultimate in
exposure _ a free minute on the network news.
   The job of making that picture and sound bite irresistible to TV
producers falls to image-makers for the two presidential candidates.
   These image-makers exert control over what gets seen on
television by confining reporters and camera-sound crews to a
twilight zone close enough for cameras but too far away for
microphones to pick up any unscripted speech.
   The result often enough: pictures of flag-draped campaign
rallies with the candidates offering snappy one-liners but no clear
discussion of the issues.
   ``That's life,'' says Richard Salant, former president of CBS
News. ``Almost everything except natural disasters are done to a
greater or lesser extent to draw the attention of the media.''
   The influence of television in the political arena goes by the
numbers:
   _At this time of year, the three network newscasts reach more
than 25 million American homes every night.
   _Deduct station breaks and commercials, and the three network
newscasts have about 22 minutes to cover the world.
   _One minute during one network news show costs a commercial
sponsor $90,000. Making that one-minute splash on all three news
shows _ the campaigns call it ``free media'' _ is a windfall worth
more than a quarter of a million dollars.
   To get their share of that limited time, campaigns must
``outguess the producer in terms of what's going to be important,''
says Robert J. Murphy, ABC's vice president for television news
coverage.
   ``What's new is the next logical step from the point of view of
the campaign manager _ once you get your view in, how do you keep
everything else out of it,'' he said. ``That's what the Reagan
administration has done, very effectively, and that's now what
campaign managers are being judged on.''
   The managers, especially the Bush managers, are being judged in
some quarters as entirely too effective.
   ``More than ever before, the whole campaign is in the control of
image-makers,'' says Salant.
   Bush, who has many of the same advisers who worked with Reagan,
has used his status as a sitting vice president to produce some
striking images in the campaign. He was shown witnessing the
destruction of the first U.S. missiles under the treaty with the
Soviet Union and greeting the Discovery astronauts after the space
shuttle landed in California.
   Dukakis sought to turn that around, unleashing a series of
television commercials on ``The Packaging of George Bush.''
   The Democratic presidential candidate also has tried to use
``free media'' to his own advantage.
   Just this week, Dukakis borrowed a trumpet and played a few bars
of ``Happy Days are Here Again.'' It was a made-for-TV visual and
sound bite, but one that may have backfired because it was coupled
with reports showing Dukakis dropping in the polls.
   During a recent campaign stop in Illinois, Bush acknowledged,
``We all do silly things in campaigns.''
   ``I wish you could have been with me out there in Disneyland,''
he said. ``I was standing there and these three little pigs kept
staring at me, so I know what it is to be on the receiving end and
do dumb things. ...
   ``But the one that takes the cake was him riding around in that
tank, the governor of Massachusetts in that tank,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis' ride in an M-1 tank across a grassy field in Michigan
on Sept. 13 was undertaken to respond to Bush's charges that he was
soft on defense.
   Roger Ailes, media adviser to Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and
now to Bush, has said that the news is much more important than
advertising in defining a candidate. It is Ailes' job, and the job
of his counterparts in the Dukakis campaign, to define the news.
   What happens when control is threatened?
   After the presidential candidates met in two debates with
formats dictated by the two campaigns, Bush declined an offer by
ABC's ``Nightline'' for a free-for-all session with Dukakis.
   ``Frankly, our campaign schedule requires the candidate to be on
the road after the second debate, taking his message to the voters
directly,'' Bush spokesman Mark Goodin explained. He did not
mention the minimum of 5 million households that tune in nightly to
``Nightline.''
   Robert A. Mosbacher Sr., Bush's finance chairman, has said that
$30 million to $35 million of the campaign's funds will go for
television advertising, the lion's share of the $54.4 million it is
allowed to spend overall.
   The Dukakis campaign has said it plans a comparable TV blitz.
   ``It's nobody's fault, it's what's happening with the times,''
Frederick Koenig, professor of social psychology at Tulane
University, said of the campaigns' heavy reliance on television.
   Koenig says studies showed voters in the past chose a candidate
by picking up information from speeches and then discussing it with
others. ``I can remember growing up that people would sit around
and argue politics, sitting on their porches or in bars,'' he said.
   Now, in a time when the A.C. Nielsen Co. says the average viewer
has the TV set on for 6 hours, 59 minutes per day and increasing
numbers of families have more than one set, people don't even
discuss television shows with each other, Koenig said.
   ``There has been a fragmentation of opinion-forming,'' he said.
   At the same time, the candidates are getting less time on the
air.
   Voters used to hear half-hour and even one-hour political
speeches on radio or television, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a
professor of communications at the University of Texas and author
of ``Packaging the Presidency.'' By 1964, she said, 60-second spots
became popular and now the 30-second spot is the norm.
   Network news executives believe long stories drive away
audiences, she said, and that reinforces the public's expectation
that it will get short stories.
   ``There has been more substance in this campaign than is clear
to people who are watching the network news,'' Jamieson said.
   Michael Robinson, associate professor of government at
Georgetown University, says that suits voters, too. ``They have
always been interested in brevity, and we have this romantic notion
that at some point the voters were really actively involved in the
process. They weren't,'' Robinson says.
   CBS correspondent Bob Schieffer, who has traveled with the Bush
campaign, said ``I think we do have to resist a pretty picture
every so often.'' Schieffer said he drew the line on Labor Day when
Bush set out to help load fish in San Diego.
   ``I declined to use the pictures in my story because I thought
it was silly, because I didn't think it had anything to do with his
qualifications to be president,'' Schieffer said.
   Jamieson said television still can help voters become deeply
informed.
   The C-Span cable television channel runs unedited speeches by
the presidential candidates most evenings, for example, and public
television's MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour tackles issues in depth.

<TEXT>
   Wisconsin Democratic officials say they
believe the cutting of a telephone cable at the party's Racine
phone bank was an act of political sabotage.
   Fourteen telephone lines serving the phone bank were knocked out
Friday when the cable was cut on the roof, authorities said. The
line was replaced before the office reopened Saturday. Police said
Wednesday they had no leads.
   ``It's outrageous, absolutely outrageous,'' said Wisconsin
Democratic Party Chairwoman Suellen Albrecht.
   ``This is the most serious attempt (to disrupt a campaign) since
the Watergate days,'' Albrecht said. ``It brings politics in
Wisconsin to a new low.''
   The phone bank is operated by volunteers to drum up support for
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, U.S. Senate candidate Herb
Kohl and local legislative candidates.
   Workers at the phone bank said the lines apparently were cut
shortly after the office closed Friday night.
   ``We haven't had any disgruntled employees or volunteers,'' said
Steve Morrissey, Democratic coordinator for the 1st Congressional
District. ``It was obviously someone who didn't want the phone
calls made.''
   Morrissey said the door leading to the second floor and roof was
locked Friday night.
   Wisconsin Bell installed the cable when the phone bank was
established in the mostly vacant building.
   ``Somebody knew where those wires were,'' said Marcel Dandeneau,
chairman of the Racine County Democratic Party. ``Somebody went up
there and very neatly cut the whole batch.''
   Donald Walsh, chairman of the Racine County Republican Party,
said the incident was ``stooping awfully low'' and that no local
GOP member was involved.
   ``I'm disappointed, if indeed it did happen,'' Walsh said.
``Every time an act of God or something happens, you can't run
paranoid to the fact that someone is trying to sabotage your
efforts.''

   The New York Power Authority shut down its
Indian Point 3 nuclear power plant early today when a small amount
of radioactive water mixed with the water that turns the turbine
generator.
   There was no public health threat, the authority said in a
statement. The radioactive gas released into the atmosphere was
less than 0.1 percent of the level permitted by the federal
government during normal plant operations.
   Plant officials declared an ``unusual event,'' the lowest of
four classifications for occurrences at nuclear power plants, at
11:25 p.m. Wednesday, the release said.
   Federal and local officials were notified and the gradual
shutdown of the plant, in Westchester County north of New York
City, was completed early today.
   A small perforation in a tube in one of the plant's four steam
generators allowed water that is heated by the nuclear reactor _
and which becomes radioactive _ to mix with water in a separate
system that is meant to turn to steam from the heat and turn the
turbine, the power authority said.
   It was not immediately known how long the plant will have to
remain shut down, said authority spokesman Carl Patrick.
   ``It will depend on what the inspection shows and what repairs
are necessary,'' he said.
   Indian Point 3 had reopened Sunday after a one-week shutdown
caused by an unrelated problem, he said. Before that, it had
operated for 116 days without a problem.

   Two members of a television news team
returning from the site of a fatal plane crash were killed when
their helicopter clipped a power line in a remote hilly area near
here and slammed to the ground.
   Leo Galanis, a reporter-pilot for KUSA-TV in Denver, and Brian
Hostetler, a photographer, died in the accident in west-central
Colorado on Wednesday, said Bob Sullivan, the station's assistant
news director.
   The crash was the sixth serious accident and the second with
fatalities since the city's television stations began using the
aircraft 10 years ago.
   The bodies were not retrieved Wednesday because ``it's just too
rugged'' to move through the terrain in darkness, said Douglas
County Sheriff Steve Zotos. Federal investigators were to join the
sheriff's deputies today at the scene near here, about 45 miles
southwest of metropolitan Denver, Zotos said.
   Galanis, 43, and Hostetler, 28, had been filming at the site
where a Piper Cherokee 140 crashed Tuesday, killing three children
and critically burning their parents.
   Sullivan said the two had talked to station personnel several
times by telephone before they started back to Denver.
   ``I believe Leo said there were some high winds, but he didn't
seem to be real concerned about it,'' Sullivan said.
   Their helicopter apparently hit a power line, crashed to the
ground and shattered, officials said.
   Patrick Parkhill, a helicopter pilot for Public Service Co. of
Colorado who had been sent to the area to determine the cause of a
power outage, discovered the crash.
   ``You couldn't really tell (it was a helicopter),'' Parkhill
said. ``It was torn up pretty bad.''
   Parkhill said it was raining in the area before he discovered
the wreckage.
   In December 1982, pilot Karen Key and aviation mechanic Larry
Zane were killed when the helicopter she was flying for what is now
KCNC-TV, Denver's Channel 4, crashed south of Denver. They were en
route to a southern Colorado plane crash when the copter went down
in a snowstorm.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson urged House Democrats
today to campaign vigorously for Michael Dukakis, their party's
presidential nominee, when Congress adjourns for the year.
   ``Governor Dukakis supplies the priorities, we can supply
passion,'' Jackson told reporters after his half-hour session with
lawmakers in the House chamber.
   Democrats have been taking a pounding in recent days with
national polls showing Republican nominee George Bush widening his
lead over Dukakis less than three weeks before the Nov. 8 election.
   ``Nineteen days is a lot of time,'' said Democratic National
Chairman Paul Kirk, who also addressed the House members. ``I don't
see trouble, I see opportunity.''
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, who heads the 255-member House
Democratic Caucus, said the message from Jackson and Kirk was that
``it's not over till it's over, we need your help, there's still
three weeks to go.''
   About 175 House Democrats attended the session, she said.
   ``It was an energizing meeting we all needed,'' Ms. Oakar said.
``We've been working around the clock here. It's hard to think of
national offices when you're working on drug bills.''
   House and Senate leaders had hoped Congress would adjourn two
weeks ago. But both chambers have been trying to complete work on a
massive anti-drug bill, which they hope to accomplish by Friday.

   Former Prime Minister James Callaghan collapsed at
a memorial service today and was taken to a hospital, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Lord Callaghan, 76, Labor prime minister between 1976 and 1979,
became ill at St. Margaret's Church, near Parliament, at a service
for a former colleague and was taken to nearby St. Thomas' Hospital.
   A hospital spokeswoman said Callaghan, who suffered a mild heart
attack in June, was being kept at the hospital for observation.
   ``Jim Callaghan was taken slightly ill. We are not quite certain
what the problem is. He was fully conscious when he arrived. His
condition is comfortable but we are keeping him in for
observation,'' she said on condition of anonymity.
   ``It is a hot day and he was at a memorial service. You can draw
your own conclusions from that,'' she said.
   The service was for Lord Peart, agriculture minister in the
Callaghan government.
   The domestic news agency, Press Association, quoted other people
attending the service as saying Callaghan's problem became apparent
during a part of the service when the congregation was standing.
Callaghan became weak and said he needed to sit down, the agency
said.

<TEXT>
   A Lutheran minister has been arrested
on charges that he raped a 14-year-old confirmation student in a
church bathroom and then threatened to hurt her mother if the girl
reported it.
   The Rev. Robert Hawkinson, 68, who serves churches in western
Minnesota in Battle Lake, Henning and Amor, was scheduled for a
bond hearing today, said Otter Trail County Attorney Mike Kirk.
   The charges of first- and second-degree criminal sexual conduct
were filed Tuesday. The complaint said Hawkinson asked the girl to
stay in church after a confirmation class to discuss a situation in
her family. After their conversation, the girl went to the bathroom
and the minister followed her. There he raped her on the bathroom
floor and told her he would hurt her mother if she reported the
rape, according to the complaint.
   The attack allegedly occurred April 13 at Grace Lutheran Church
in Henning. It was reported to authorities in September ``in an
indirect sort of way'' after the alleged victim told her
girlfriend, Kirk said.
   In an interview with sheriff's deputies, Hawkinson denied the
girl's charges, Kirk said.
   ``But he asked one of the deputies, `would it be possible to do
something like that and not remember it?''' Kirk said.

   Five Carmelite nuns protesting what
they claim is the liberalization of their cloister have agreed to
temporarily cease talking to the news media and public about their
impasse.
   The five rebellious nuns, who have locked themselves in the
monastery's infirmary, agreed to the request of their prioress to
spend two days in prayer and contemplation, said Sister John of the
Cross, a spokeswoman for the group.
   ``We never want anyone to say we're disobedient,'' said Sister
John.
   The nuns barricaded themselves in the infirmary of the Monastery
of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel on Oct. 4.
   They claim the conservative nature that attracted them to the
Discalced Carmelite order has been violated by the new prioress,
Mother Theresa Hewitt. They say she has introduced television,
sweets and more socializing than had been customary.
   Mother Theresa Hewitt and officials of the Paterson Roman
Catholic diocese say the nuns have had disciplinary problems and
refused to accept the prioress' authority.
   The diocese tried to transfer the nuns, who locked themselves in
the infirmary to avoid what they felt would be immediate expulsion.
   Earlier this week, the five nuns refused to deal with a
Carmelite priest, the Rev. Kevin Culligan, arguing that he lacked
proper Vatican credentials.

<HEAD>Soviet Press Agency Chief Named to Foreign Policy Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the government press agency Novosti,
Valentin M. Falin, has been elevated to a new foreign policy post
in the Communist Party apparatus, Soviet officials said today.
   Falin, 62, was named to a job that pairs the responsibilities of
two formerly separate posts held by Anatoly F. Dobrynin and Vadim
A. Medvedev.
   Falin will head the newly reorganized International Department
of the Soviet Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters at a
government briefing.
   The International Department, previously headed by Dobrynin, was
responsible for relations with non-ruling communist parties and
overall foreign policy.
   A separate Central Committee office dealt with ruling communist
parties abroad. Under a revamping of the Central Committee, the two
departments have been combined and the overall title is the
International Department, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yuri
A. Gremitskikh, said later in an interview.
   A Central Committee employee, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Falin was appointed to his new post last week.
   His departure left both Soviet news agencies without a chief.
Sergei A. Losev, director of Tass, died earlier this month. His
successor has not been named, and Gerasimov said Falin's old job
was now open.
   Falin will report to Alexander N. Yakovlev, a key ally to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev who was named in a major Kremlin
shake-up Sept. 30 to head a new foreign affairs commission of the
Central Committee, Gerasimov said.
   In the shakeup, Dobrynin, a former Soviet ambassador to
Washington, was retired, and Medvedev was elevated to the ruling
Politburo and put in charge of ideology.
   Two deputies to Falin have also been named to posts as part of
the reorganization of the International Department. Gerasimov
identified them as Karen N. Brutents and Rafael Fedorov.
   Falin served as Soviet ambassador to West Germany in 1971-1978
and was appointed chairman of Novosti on March 10, 1986.
   Another former Soviet ambasssador, Alexander S. Kapto, who
served in Cuba from 1986 until this year, was named head of the
Central Committee's Ideological Department, Tass, the official news
agency, reported. There, he will presumably report to Medvedev.

<TEXT>
   A three-month undercover operation by
U.S. Customs agents led to the arrest of a city electrical engineer
who has been charged with obtaining sophisticated weapons parts for
shipment overseas.
   Agents arrested Ali Foyuzi Yousefi, 45, on Wednesday, said
police Lt. Charles Cabaniss. He was charged with violating the
Federal Arms Exportation Control Act, said Larry Hunter, head of
U.S. Customs office in Columbia.
   Hunter said Yousefi was an illegal alien. When asked what
country the parts were being shipped to, he responded: ``Mr.
Yousefi is an Iranian.'' He did not elaborate.
   The parts involved belonged to a Hawk missile, a source close to
the investigation told The Rock Hill Herald.
   Yousefi was questioned for about two hours at his office at the
city's Operations Center before officers led him away in handcuffs.
His house also was searched for evidence.
   Yousefi was to be arraigned before a federal judge in Columbia
today.
   Cabaniss said police were notified by federal investigators in
mid-July of the operation by the Customs Department, which began
its investigation after learning that a Rock Hill man had contacted
several U.S. Defense Department contractors in California several
months ago.
   In the undercover operation, Customs agents met with the Rock
Hill man several times to arrange the weapons purchase. Cabaniss
said the man used several aliases in his dealings with agents.
   The parts were delivered to Yousefi last week _ an action that
prompted a full week of constant surveillance of the engineer,
Cabaniss said.
   ``Once he took possession of this stuff, we never lost sight of
him,'' Cabaniss said. About 20 federal agents were brought in last
week as the operation neared an end.

<TEXT>
   Hens fed a special diet have produced eggs
with less than half the cholesterol of regular eggs, say farmers
who hope the new eggs will appeal to consumers concerned about
cholesterol.
   But a heart disease specialist said they are ``not a huge
breakthrough.''
   Excessive deposits of cholesterol are thought to produce
arteriosclerosis, which might lead to artery and heart disease.
   ``If the doc says you need a low-cholesterol diet, this is just
the thing,'' declared Paul May, manager of Rosemary Farm in Santa
Maria, where the special-diet hens are laying the eggs.
   May said about 25 percent of his farm's 300,000 chickens are fed
a diet currently being kept secret while lawyers see if it can be
patented.
   The eggs are also a little lower in sodium, which has been
associated with high blood pressure, he said. May said the eggs
have 55 milligrams of sodium, compared with 70 milligrams in a
regular egg.
   The eggs, which went on sale Tuesday in San Luis Obispo, Santa
Barbara and Ventura counties, are 30 percent more expensive to the
consumer than regular eggs, May said.
   A state permit confirmed the claims that the eggs have an
average of 125 milligrams of cholesterol compared with an average
278 milligrams in a standard grade AA egg, according to Ardie
Ferrill, supervisor of egg inspection for the state Department of
Food and Agriculture in Sacramento.
   The low-cholesterol claims for the new eggs ``are absolutely
true,'' Ferrill said.
   After running the eggs through laboratory tests, the agency
issued a permit that allows the farm to boast on labels that its
eggs are lower in cholesterol, he said. It is the only such permit
issued in California.
   The eggs were developed in part through consultation with
University of California scientists and a nutritionist, May said.
He added that they contain ``no drugs or additives.''
   The American Heart Association recommends that an adult keep the
average daily dietary intake of cholesterol below 300 milligrams.
   University of California at San Francisco biochemist John Kane,
an authority on diet and heart disease, is not sold on the new eggs.
   When it comes to eggs, less cholesterol is not the same as low
cholesterol, he said.
   ``These eggs are not a huge breakthrough,'' said Kane, who
nevertheless acknowledged the advantage in reducing cholesterol in
eggs.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of public service employees unhappy with
their pay walked off the job today in a one-day strike that
affected mail delivery, public transportation and schools.
   In Paris, subway and bus service was reduced by about half to
two-thirds. Commuters who feared the worst and drove into the city
found huge traffic jams. Highways leading into the capital were
backed up as much as 17 miles.
   Air France canceled 31 of its 118 medium-range flights; major
rail lines were running at half to two-thirds their usual number;
production of electricity was cut by about 15 percent; little mail
was delivered; customs was on strike; and many welfare and social
security windows were closed.
   In much of the country, teachers did not show up for classes.
   Employees received a 1 percent raise in March and another 1
percent in September. When talks began this month between unions
and Civil Service Minister Michel Durafour, the workers learned
they would not receive any more pay increases this year and a 2.2.
percent raise was being offered for 1989.
   Inflation is expected to hit 2.8 percent in 1988, and the public
workers see themselves losing 0.8 percent in purchasing power.
   ``The worst thing that could happen would be that the government
continue in its obstinacy,'' said Jean Kaspar, national secretary
of the Socialist-run French Democratic Confederation of Labor. He
spoke during a demonstration by several thousand strikers in
central Paris.
   Civil service workers traditionally vote left, and they are
especially disappointed by the lack of sympathy they perceive on
the part of the Socialist government that took over from the
conservatives after spring elections.
   Workers feel the French economy has been improving and that
after years of austerity, they should now benefit. The government
has pleaded for more time.

another wildfire, officials said today.
   The Divide Fire, in the Angeles Fire above Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley, was 90 percent contained this morning. The fire
was started Sunday by a 10-year-old boy playing with matches.
   The firefighting force has been reduced and the 850 firefighters

area, officials said.
   The 2,700-acre blaze near Sequoia's Giant Forest, where some
trees are 2,000 years old, was 70 percent contained, said U.S.
Forest Service spokesman Earl Clayton. A cigarette apparently
dropped by a fisherman started the fire Sunday morning.

   An American, four Pakistanis and two
Egyptians were killed when their car, loaded with weapons for
Afghan rebels, hit a mine in southeastern Afghanistan, Radio Kabul
said today.
   The Afghan government radio, monitored in Islamabad, said the
seven were killed in Zabul province but did not say when. No names
were given.
   It said the car was loaded with arms and ammunition for
U.S.-supported Afghan guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed
government.
   A Western diplomat said he received a ``vague'' message today
reporting the death of an American and other foreigners inside
Afghanistan. But he said on condition of anonymity that the report
was not confirmed.
   On Sunday, Radio Kabul said two Americans were killed during a
government attack on rebel positions near Gardez, 60 miles
southeast of Kabul, the Afghan capital. It did not identify the
Americans other than to say they were advisers helping Moslem
insurgents, who have been fighting the Marxist government for the
past 10 years.
   Western diplomats said no American citizens were in Afghanistan
on official business.
   Three American journalists have been killed covering the
conflict inside Afghanistan.
   The radio said six rockets hit the capital today, killing two
people and injuring two.
   Radio Kabul also said Afghan security officers seized three
British-made long-range missiles near Kabul on Sunday.
   A rocket attack launched by Afghan insurgents killed nine people
Wednesday and injured 17 near Kabul airport, Afghan security
officers said. They said two Soviet women and a 2-year-old Soviet
girl were among those killed.
   The Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan in December 1979,
and 100,000 have helped the government fight the rebels. The Red
Army began withdrawing May 15 in line with a U.N.-brokered pact.
Half of the troops left by Aug. 15 and the remainder are to be out
by Feb. 15.

   A moderate earthquake that rumbled through
parts of Maine and New Hampshire today sounded like a sonic boom
and shook buildings, but no damage was reported, authorities said.
   The temblor measured 4.0 on the Richter scale, said Walter
Anderson, director of the Maine Geological Survey. He said that
measurement was from the Weston Observatory in Weston, Mass. Other
reports put the temblor at 3.9 on the Richter scale, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.
   The quake, which struck at 9:10 a.m., was believed to have been
centered about five miles north east of Berlin in northeastern New
Hampshire, Anderson said. But authorities said rumblings and booms
were reported all the way from central New Hampshire to Yarmouth on
the Maine coast.
   ``I thought it was a load of lumber falling,'' said Sandy
Endicott, a secretary at P.H. Chadbourne & Co. lumber yard in
Bethel, west of here. George Nickerson, a maintenance supervisor at
Chadbourne's, said the temblor ``wiggled the maintenance garage.''
   Leo Perron, 78, of Berlin, N.H., said, ``It shook the whole
house. Pictures on the wall, everything in it went flopping back
and forth.''
   Perron said he has been through several earthquakes before, but
this was the worst he had felt in 30 years.
   It ``felt like a sonic boom,'' said Bob Barbin, a reporter for
radio station WMOV in Berlin.
   Police in Berlin received more than 100 telephone calls after
the quake.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 4 can cause moderate damage in a
populated area..

<HEAD>AIDS Reaching Some of Earth's Most Isolated Populations</HEAD>

   In the streets of Khartoum, capital of the
desert African nation of Sudan, 7 percent of homeless children test
positive for exposure to the AIDS virus.
   In northern Thailand, the first positive AIDS tests popped up
just this year.
   In the jungles of Suriname, reachable only by air or boat, at
least five members of a South American tribe are dying of AIDS.
   Steamboats, trucks, family reunions and space rockets have all
helped AIDS spread to some of Earth's most isolated populations,
according to researchers, sociologists and health workers at the
First International Symposium on Education and Communication About
AIDS being held here this week.
   ``There are 40 million street children in the world, and we
suddenly realized they're all at risk for AIDS because so many turn
to prostitution,'' said Peter Dalglish, who founded Street Kids
International and ran an AIDS testing program in the Sudan.
   Dalglish, citing UNICEF figures for the number of homeless
children in the world's largest cities, said the deadly disease
entered the Sudan via truck drivers and Nile River steamers from
central Africa, where AIDS incidence is high.
   Poverty, guerrilla war, illiteracy, countrysides empty of
televisions or even radios, and lack of resources combine to
frustrate workers trying to reach isolated populations.
   ``We're talking about some countries where a national health
budget of one dollar per person per year is a drain on the
economy,'' said Dr. Manuel Carballo, head of the social and
behavioral unit at the World health Organization in Geneva.
   All the negative factors affect the jungles of southern
Suriname, home to 35,000 Maroons descended from African slaves who
escaped from coastal plantations.
   Despite their seeming isolation, said Dr. Ruben del Prado, the
space age helped ease the path of the AIDS virus when Maroon men
traveled to French Guyana to work on roads and on buildings at the
European Space Agency's launch facility at Kourou.
   ``Where they were infected _ Suriname or French Guyana _ is a
sensitive political question,'' said del Prado, who works for
Medical Mission, a private interreligous organization in Suriname.
``But French Guyana is where they went, and there is a great inflow
and outflow of Europeans there'' _ a factor associated with the
spread of the virus.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is transmitted through
sexual contact, infected blood transfusions and the sharing of
syringes. It impairs the body's ability to fight off disease, and
no cure has been found.
   The cases detected among the Maroons were not just positive
tests or exposure to the virus, which can incubate for years, but
advanced cases of the disease itself, he said.
   Del Prado, who spent three years among the Maroons, said health
workers haven't been able to enter the area for a year because of
an insurgency movement against the central Surinamese government.
   He worries that AIDS, once at large in the closed Maroon
society, will become rampant because of frequent exposure to
tropical and venereal diseases, complete lack of education or
social support and the fact that sexual activity routinely starts
as early as age eight.
   In Thailand, it is Bangkok's sex industry that poses a danger,
even in the remote north, said Werasit Sittitrai, AIDS project
coordinator for the Thai Red Cross Society.
   ``In northern Thailand, there are almost no girls 15 to 20 years
old,'' said Sittitrai. ``They're all in the south and it's quite
open. Families visit their girls in the south, boyfriends, they'll
all stay in the same hotels.''
   The first case of evidence of AIDS in the north cropped up last
summer, but Sittitrai, who is running an agressive outreach program
for prostitutes, is optimistic that the epidemic will be contained.
   ``We believe we can teach even prostitutes how to have safe sex
if we keep working,'' he said.
   Cultural and political factors can make areas newly open to AIDS
difficult to work in, health professionals say. Dalglish said he
talked to Arab merchants who freely admitted having sex with boys,
``but they don't consider that homosexuality so they won't admit
one of the risk factors exists.''
   ``There's usually a period of denial,'' said Anthony Meyer, who
is head of health promotion for WHO's global program on AIDS.
``Then you see a national committee made up of scientists; then you
see the health minister, the education minister joining the
committee, and you know they're taking it seriously.''
   That happens, said Sittitrai, ``because of the pressure of
AIDS.'' The disease keeps spreading, and people keep dying, he said.

   The Union of Greek shipowners has signed
an agreement with the U.S. Customs Service to participate in a
crackdown on drug smuggling, the organization said Thursday.
   Nearly 2,000 merchant vessels and their companies are enrolled
in the program, the union said.
   The agreement was signed on Oct. 4 after the Customs Service
conducted a series of seminars in this port city near Athens.
   The shipowners' union said it was the first national merchant

   Police cordoned off sections of the
capital Thursday to conduct anti-terrorist exercises, a government
spokesman said.
   The exercise tested the ability of a new anti-terrorist police
unit, said the spokesman, Sotiris Kostopoulos.
   The government has stepped up its anti-terrorism capability
after Arab gunmen opened fire on a Greek cruise ship in July,
killing nine people and injuring 98 others.
   Police also are fighting two Greek organizations _ November 17,
which claims a dozen political killings, and Revolutionary Popular
Struggle, responsible for hundreds of bombings but no deaths.
   In August, November 17 raided a police station, held five police
officers at gunpoint and fled with arms and ammunition.

<HEAD>Government Launches Campaign For Economic Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials launched a nationwide campaign to rally
citizens behind new economic reforms, the Xinhua News Agency
reported Thursday.
   Officials of the Secretariat that conducts the daily affairs of
the ruling Communist Party are meeting with provincial officials to
try to ``unify the nation's thinking and action.''
   Local officials, who have gained substantial autonomy over
economic decision-making, largely have ignored government efforts
to reduce the more than 20 percent inflation rate and widespread
black market activity.
   The new campaign indicates the leadership's determination to
assert central control and enforce austerity measures.
   Hu Qili, head of the Secretariat, told the meeting that the
purpose of the drive was to make party officials and citizens
``rally around'' a program to restore economic order, Xinhua said.
   The government last month ordered reductions in capital
investment and spending, a halt to most public construction
projects, tighter loan policies by banks and a crackdown on illegal
business practices.
   Implementation of the reforms, first proposed more than two
years ago, were delayed in order to allow prices of consumer goods
to adjust to market forces.
   The central government has the double burden of convincing local
officials to cooperate with the changes and assuring citizens of
their commitment to development and economic reform.
   The official Economic Daily responded to the new campaign
Thursday in a front-page editorial that tried to placate worries
about economic strategies.
   The article posed a series of questions challenging the new
policies, and answered each one reassuringly.
   ``If reform doesn't go forward, won't it go backward?'' it asked.
   The answer: ``The adjustment of the timetable for price reform
is not a retreat, but merely a step backward before the main
attack.''
   Addressing concerns that tighter central control will stifle
needed development, the newspaper said: ``Reform cannot be simply
equated with giving up all centralized control. The reform
necessitates a new division of central and localized powers.''

   House and Senate negotiators reached
agreements on a compromise anti-drug bill today as they raced to
complete the only measure keeping Congress in session this election
year.
   With many members already campaigning for re-election back home,
colleagues writing the drug bill came to tentative agreement on
death-penalty language. They closed in on an agreement to deny some
federal benefits to convicted drug offenders, including users.
   Senate leaders have said the chamber might approve the drug bill
by voice vote if enough members are reluctant to return to
Washington to conduct a roll call. House members returned Wednesday
after nearly a week off and are expected to remain at the Capitol
for the drug vote, which would be scheduled Friday at the earliest.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said negotiators agreed to drop Senate-passed
language designed to strengthen anti-obscenity laws. House members
argued successfully that the language gave the federal government
too much power over what Americans view or read.
   In return, Biden said, the House appeared willing to accept
Senate language on denial of benefits to drug users. The punishment
would deny grants, contracts, loans, mortgage guarantees and
permits, but not affect Social Security, Medicare, veterans'
assistance and welfare.
   The Senate language would give judges discretion over whether to
deny benefits.
   Negotiators agreed that the death penalty could apply if a
murder is committed during a felony-level drug crime and if the
killer was engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; was
trafficking in major amounts of cocaine, heroin or other drugs;
intentionally gave an order that resulted in a killing, or killed a
police officer.
   One key House law enforcement section was dropped from the bill
Wednesday night.
   The House provision would have permitted introduction in federal
court of evidence seized illegally, but in ``good faith'' _ even
when a search was made without a warrant. Current law permits the
``good faith'' exception only when searches are conducted with
warrants.
   The negotiators accepted Senate language on child pornography,
including a 20-year to life prison term for anyone convicted of
facilitating use of a child for producing sexually explicit
materials.
   The buying and selling of children to produce child pornography
would be made a federal crime.
   The lawmakers agreed to language that would require the Justice
Department to devise a system to allow gun dealers to check whether
gun purchasers are convicted felons.
   The provision originated in the House as a substitute for an
optional seven-day waiting period for handgun buyers.
   The final bill, negotiators agreed, will include civil fines for
those found in possession of illegal drugs, including marijuana and
cocaine. But the records can be expunged from the record after a
period of time.
   Lawmakers agreed that states would initially have to contribute
25 percent of the cost to receive federal grants for anti-drug
crime programs. After the first year of the four-year program, the
state match would go to 50 percent.
   Senate language requiring that 10 percent of federal anti-crime
grants go for street-level enforcement was dropped, and the
decision would be left to the states.

<HEAD>Broussard Blames Media For Daughter's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a religious group whose daughter
was killed in Oregon said today that negative media coverage of his
organization was responsible for her beating death.
   ``Irresponsible media put me in a precarious situation,''
Eldridge Broussard Jr. said in an appearance on Oprah Winfrey's
syndicated television talk show.
   Broussard is head of the Los Angeles-based Watts Christian
Center and the now-defunct Ecclesia Athletic Association.
   ``For the last year and a half I have had to walk around this
country as a suspected cult leader,'' he said, adding reporters had
labeled him ``the new Jim Jones.''
   Broussard's 8-year-old daughter, Dayna Lorea, died Friday.
Authorities say the death was the result of beatings at a camp run
by Broussard outside Portland, Ore., for youngsters from the Los
Angeles district of Watts.
   Four men associated with Broussard's group have been charged
with manslaughter in the child's death.
   But Broussard, 35, denied today that children were beaten or
abused at the camp.
   He told Ms. Winfrey they were ``spanked,'' and that the
military-like discipline reported at the camp was necessary to
enable the children to endure city life.
   ``Abuse may be to do anything that does not prepare them to be
on their toes in a rather paranoid, trigger-happy Los Angeles
situation,'' Broussard said. ``We teach our children the moment
someone of authority says something to you, you snap to it.''
   Broussard said standards of discipline in Oregon were different
than those in Watts, and that if authorities from Los Angeles were
to inspect his daughter's body they would draw different
conclusions than those reached by Oregon officials.
   He said the negative publicity Ecclesia received when the group
arrived in Oregon last year cost his group financial backing and
led to suspension of its activities. As a result, Broussard said,
staff members were performing duties for which they lacked proper
qualifications.
   ``I feel that if we hadn't been misinterpreted by the media, our
people wouldn't even have been in Sandy that night,'' he said.
   Broussard said Ecclesia was dissolved last year and the children
who were taken into custody by state officials in Oregon were part
of the Watts Christian Center school and training program.
   Broussard, smiling and apparently unemotional for most of the
hourlong show, at one point broke down in tears, asking Ms. Winfrey
to help him uncover the real facts surrounding the case.
   ``I don't believe anyone else will give me a chance,'' Broussard
said.
   After his daughter's death, 53 children attending the Watts
Christian Center school and training program headed by Broussard,
were taken into custody at a rural house near Sandy, about 30 miles
east of Portland.
   Two other children involved with the group were taken into
custody in Los Angeles.
   The Clackamas County Juvenile Department has charged that
children at the camp were routinely beaten with paddles or
electrical cord. Some children were beaten up to 800 times while
others were forced to watch and keep count, the department said in
a court petition.
   Donald Welch, director of Clackamas County Juvenile Court, said
leaders of the group had beaten and whipped children as an integral
part of its program to heighten athletic performance, much like
harrassment commonly used in military-style basic training.

<HEAD>Pinochet's Cabinet Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet's Cabinet
resigned today, the government announced. Opponents hoped the move
would clear the way for talks on democratic reforms.
   Orlando Poblete, the government secretary-general with
ministerial ranking, said he and the 15 other Cabinet members
handed in their resignations to give maneuvering room to Pinochet,
loser of an Oct. 5 referendum.
   The resignations allow the 72-year-old leader ``to select his
people and take the steps he considers proper in this
post-plebiscite stage'' of government, Poblete said.
   Poblete made the announcement to reporters at the government
palace immediately after a brief meeting of the full Cabinet. He
gave no details, but it was widely assumed that Pinochet would
accept at least some of the resignations and that key changes would
be made.
   Pinochet, the right-wing army commander, lost by more than
800,000 votes in the yes-no ballot ballot on a proposal to extend
his 15-year rule to 1997. He won 43 percent of the vote, and 55
percent voted ``no.''
   The morning after the vote his Cabinet offered their
resignations, but Pinochet rejected them, evidently needing time to
evaluate and pick replacements.
   According to the 8-year-old constitution, his term expires in
March 1990, when the winner of an open election planned for
December 1989 will assume power.
   A 16-party opposition coalition that led the campaign for
Pinochet's defeat has called for several reforms in the
constitution. It maintains that the changes are needed for full
democracy under the new elected government.
   In the two weeks since the vote the coalition's leaders have
said they were waiting for a Cabinet change as a sign that Pinochet
was willing to negotiate the changes.
   Key Cabinet members, including Poblete, helped direct Pinochet's
political campaign for the referendum and have been blamed for his
defeat.
   Pinochet has maintained no changes will be permitted in the
constitution, especially in its timetable for a return to elected
rule. The opposition has called for him to show more flexibility
and said government intransigence could spark unrest.
   Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup that deposed the elected
government of Salvador Allende, a Marxist who died in the coup.

<HEAD>Study: Love Letters May Harass Celebrities as Much as Threats</HEAD>
<NOTE>For release at 5 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who express undue love or assume another
inappropriate role when writing to celebrities are just as likely
to try approaching them as those who make threats, a new study
suggests.
   ``Some of the worst incidents that have been preceded by a
letter were preceded not by a threat letter, but by a love letter
or some other peculiar or inappropriate communication,'' said
researcher Park Dietz.
   Results suggest laws in many states that cover harassment should
be broadened to cover such circumstances as being bothered by
would-be lovers and others, he said.
   In one example of harassment, a Canadian farmer has been
convicted 11 times since 1980 of bothering Canadian-born singer
Anne Murray. Robert Kieling, 52, is convinced she is in love with
him. Under court order not to contact her or her family, Kieling
was convicted June 29 of violating the order by calling her office
263 times in the first six months of this year.
   Dietz, a professor of law and psychiatry at the University of
Virginia, spoke in a telephone interview before presenting the
study Thursday in San Francisco at the annual meeting of the
American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.
   The study involved more than 1,000 ``inappropriate'' letters
written to performers by 214 people. It also focused on attempted
approaches because they raise a risk of violence, although most are
benign, Dietz said.
   Sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, part of the
Justice Department, the study was aimed at looking for clues that
could help protect both ordinary people and celebrities from
violence, he said.
   The work is ``an important and meaningful first step'' in an
area that has not been rigorously studied, commented Mark J. Mills,
a forensic psychiatrist in Santa Monica, Calif., and member of the
American Psychiatric Association's Council on Psychiatry and the
Law.
   Analysis of letters in the study found that 17 percent of the
writers considered themselves suitors of the celebrity, while an
equal percentage cast themselves as special fans, expressing such
sentiments as: ``I'm your greatest fan, you owe me a lot. ... If it
weren't for me, you wouldn't be so famous,'' Dietz said.
   Ten percent of the writers acted like intimate friends, saying
such things as they understand the celebrity has been too busy to
send a birthday card. Another 10 percent sought sex with the
celebrity, 9 percent considered themselves a business associate or
potential collaborator, and another 9 percent considered themselves
ordinary fans but included an inappropriate message like a threat.
   Altogether, 23 percent of the letters contained some form of
threat, ranging from promises to kill the celebrity at a specific
time to statements along the line of: ``Send me a credit card or I
will cause Southern California to drop in the sea,'' Dietz said.
   But people who wrote threatening letters were no more likely to
try approaching the entertainer than other writers. That is
probably because most approaches are not made with the intent of
doing harm, Dietz said.
   ``Most of them are about efforts to fulfill some delusional
belief and hope. Where violence occurs, it's not necessarily
because the person intended to do any violence, but rather what
they expected to happen did not happen.
   ``The celebrity does not say, `Yes, we can now join our hands in
marriage and live happily ever after.' That is such a surprise to
the person whose life has been devoted to finding this perfect
union that it is upsetting, and they don't want to take no for an
answer.''
   Overall, 15 percent of the letter-writers tried to approach the
celebrity. The most popular place, accounting for 42 percent of
initial known attempts, was the celebrity's home. Dietz attributed
that partly to maps and bus tours that point out celebrity homes in
Hollywood.
   Fourteen percent of attempted approaches were at an agency
representing the public figure, 11 percent involved such behavior
as climbing on stage or insisting on going backstage at a public
appearance, and 10 percent were at a business associated with the
celebrity.
   Dietz's collaborators included Janet Warren of the University of
Virginia, psychiatrist Daryl Matthews of Kapaa, Hawaii,
psychologist Daniel Martell of New York University, and Tracy
Stewart of Yale University.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with trial ending, judge not yet

   PTL founder Jim Bakker says his faith will
pull him through the hard times, including the $52 million lawsuit
filed against him by the ministry he left in disgrace after
admitting to a sexual encounter.
   ``After two years of what I've been going through, nothing is
humbling. My faith is in God. I believe God will bring me through
all of these things,'' Bakker said today as he left U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.
   PTL's lawsuit claims Bakker, his wife, Tammy, and former top
aide David Taggart mismanaged the ministry and used PTL funds for
their personal gain. The ministry entered bankruptcy protection in
1987.
   PTL attorneys presented their side of the argument during the
first week of the trial before Judge Rufus Reynolds in September.
The trial resumed Monday with the defense and ended today.
   Reynolds did not issue an immediate verdict. The attorneys have
until Oct. 27 to submit further information or pleas. He then will
present his draft findings within 10 days.
   The attorneys will have another 10 days to submit their
responses, after which Reynolds will issue a verdict.
   In testimony Wednesday, Bakker said he wants his PTL documents
and a chance to prove he didn't abuse the TV ministry's funds.
   ``I'm pleading for my documents,'' he said. ``I just want a fair
shot. We're doing it piece by piece, but we're doing it.''
   Bakker said many records are scattered among a federal grand
jury in Charlotte, N.C., PTL offices and bankruptcy court.
   For more than a year, the grand jury has been investigating
whether the ministry raised money for one purpose and used it for
another.
   During cross-examination today, PTL attorney Brad Leggett asked
Bakker if expenditures such as $900 for a shirt and trousers for a
music director and cash tips of as much as $600 were customary at
PTL.
   ``I have no idea. I simply don't know,'' Bakker replied.
   Leggett also cross-examined Bakker on how much time he actually
spent on his duties at PTL and the Heritage USA theme park near
Fort Mill.
   ``I spent my entire day working for the ministry of Heritage
Village Church. I spent whatever time was necessary,'' Bakker said.
   The defense was preparing to rest its case later today.
   On Wednesday, Bakker's attorney, Ryan Hovis, presented minutes
from PTL board meetings and other documents showing Bakker
reimbursed the ministry for thousands of dollars in cash advances.
   ``I have always ordered that any cash advance for me personally
was always paid back 100 percent,'' Bakker testified.
   Hovis presented minutes from a September 1981 meeting showing
that the board had then granted Bakker a salary of $102,000; that
the church was to be responsible for the upkeep of the parsonage
and for utilities; and that the parsonage was to be turned over to
Bakker upon his retirement.
   In other testimony, independent financial analyst James Wilson
retook the stand Wednesday, suggesting that Bakker was underpaid
for the number of responsibilities he held at the Heritage USA
Christian retreat near Fort Mill.
   The ministry entered bankruptcy protection three months after
Bakker left in March 1987 when he admitted to a sexual encounter
with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   When asked by Hovis whether he authorized any payment to Ms.
Hahn, Bakker replied, ``I did not.'' He added, ``But I knew we were
being blackmailed and I take full responsibility.''
   Under cross-examination Wednesday by Leggett, Bakker said he
also ``did not instruct any member of my staff not to make a
payment'' to Ms. Hahn.
   An IRS report lists a number of objects that Bakker had received
through PTL for his personal benefit beyond reasonable compensation.
   But Bakker said he bought a houseboat, an unfinished, 300-foot
water slide and two Rolls Royces out of his own money. He said he
donated those and other items to PTL.
   ``I had in regular practice given back to the ministry. Part of
Christianity is giving,'' he said. ``The Heritage Village Church
has never, ever purchased a Rolls Royce for me or my family.''
   The ministry presented testimony and evidence in the first week
of the trial in September that the Bakkers received about $9.5
million in bonuses, salaries and other compensation from 1983 to
1987.

   Vice President George Bush today warned
against relaxing U.S. military strength in the face of peace
gestures from the Soviet Union and said the nation can ill afford
to elect rival Michael Dukakis, who he said has ``literally no
experience in foreign affairs.''
   The Republican presidential candidate, addressing 600 supporters
in a Knights of Columbus hall here in central New Jersey before
heading to Queens, N.Y., to accept the backing of New York City
police, accused the Massachusetts governor of opposing the U.S.
invasion of Grenada, the strike against Libya and its policy in the
Persian Gulf to protect the flow of oil there.
   ``I believe that we've got to fight terrorism and if we ever
again face clear evidence of terrorist aggression, terrorist
involvement in the taking of American lives, as we did in the case
of Libya, I would not hesitate to strike again,'' Bush said. ``We
have got to punish state-sponsored terrorism.''
   Bush and Dukakis were appearing on the same stage later tonight
when they address a Catholic charities dinner in New York City.
   Taking note of the changing colors of the autumn foliage, Bush
said, ``The leadership of the Soviet Union is changing ... but old
ambitions die hard. Systems die hard. And the leaves may be
falling, but the trees are fundamentally the same.
   ``As much as we welcome the change in the Soviet Union, now is
not the time to abandon realism about what makes the Soviet Union
move,'' he said.
   ``Those who want to abandon the policy of peace through strength
in the hopes of self-induced Soviet restraint are dead wrong,'' he
said. He criticized Dukakis for opposing the mobile MX and
Midgetman missiles, but insisting he wants to modernize the
land-based U.S. strategic force.
   ``He doesn't understand that we can't give away our best cards
and then sit down and expect to negotiate a fair treaty with the
Soviets,'' Bush said.
   ``I don't think we should risk turning over the leadership and
security of this free world of ours to a man...with literally no
experience in foreign affairs.''
   Bush was trolling for votes in New York, where polls show him
within striking distance of Dukakis.
   ``We think if we can win New York, we totally destroy his
ability to win the election,'' campaign manager Lee Atwater told
reporters on the campaign trail Wednesday in Michigan.
   Bush and his aides continued to insist there is to be no
shifting of gears or lessening of campaign efforts because of his
strength in opinion polls. Atwater said Bush would spend 80 percent
of his time in Dukakis' ``must win'' states, but he declined to
name them, other than New York.
   However, the campaign aide said the key states of the rest of
the campaign, in addition to Michigan and New Jersey, are Illinois,
Ohio and California.
   Internal campaign polling shows Bush one or two points behind
Dukakis in New York, a state Democrats usually count on for its
rich prize of 36 electoral votes, Atwater said.
   Bush told reporters he was encouraged by a new Field poll
showing a 50 percent to 41 percent lead over Dukakis in California,
but that the poll reflects a more positive position for him than
his campaign's internal polls.
   A campaign source said internal polling shows Bush with a
six-point lead in California. The Field poll had a margin of error
of 4.7 percent.
   Next week, Bush and President Reagan will appear together at a
gala campaign event in Los Angeles.
   The California strategy also includes saturation use of
commercials attacking Dukakis, because the glut of ads for state
ballot initiatives dilutes the effect of the ads if they don't run
long enough, Atwater said.
   In a speech at the University of Michigan on Wednesday, Bush
said he wants a renewed bipartisan approach to U.S. foreign affairs.
   Although he frequently blasts the Democratic-controlled Congress
as the perpetrator of poor policy, Bush said he wants
bipartisanship to be ``once more the vibrant heart of a foreign
policy that is decided by a debate which ends at the water's edge.''
   But he did not hesitate to deride his Democratic opponent in the
same speech.
   ``Lacking foreign policy experience, he has a rather unrealistic
view of America's role and the way in which we lead,'' Bush said.
   Bush also said that if elected, he would convene a summit of
NATO allies to consider future use of the allied forces, with an
eye toward budget-restraint and burden-sharing.
   Asked later if he would stop criticizing Congress in the
interest of bipartisanship, Bush said: ``No, I'm going to keep the
pressure on and get them to work in a bipartisan spirit with the
next president. It's very important.''

   President Reagan met with Italian Socialist
leader Bettino Craxi today and ``stressed the strong, friendly
bilateral relations between our two countries,'' the White House
said.
   Craxi, in Washington to receive an award from the
Italian-American Foundation, was prime minister of Italy from 1983
to 1987 and is now head of the Italian Socialist Party.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan indicated
appreciation of Italy's deicison to accept the U.S. 401st Tactical
Fighter Wing, which the Spanish government had asked be moved from
Torrejon, Spain.
   Fitzwater said Reagan commended Italy's contribution to western
security and ``discussed East-West relations in general.''
   ``The president talked about the strength of NATO and how
important that is,'' the spokesman said.
   The meeting lasted about 20 minutes.

   Relatives of 10 people killed when an Air
Force jet careened into a hotel visited the accident scene today on
the first anniversary of the crash and accused government officials
of showing little compassion.
   ``The U.S. Air Force has failed to treat survivors of the crash
with human dignity, rather the Air Force has chosen to hide behind
Indiana's wrongful death law,'' said Robert Goldberg, whose
daughter, Beth, was among the victims.
   ``This unjust law declares that the lives of single adults
without dependents are worth nothing,'' he said.
   Air Force Master Sgt. Larry Martin, who lost his daughter, Dawn
Shelly, said, ``Since my daughter's death, the Air Force has shown
little compassion for our family. We have not received one letter
or phone call or personal visit from a chaplain.''
   The family members say they want a jury to decide whether the
crash was caused by negligence. And if it was, they believe a jury
should be able to award damages.
   Indiana's wrongful death law does not allow damages for adults
who died because of someone else's negligence but who have no
dependents.
   The Air Force and the hotel's owners have been unable to agree
on a cost for damages and the Ramada Inn hotel remains mostly
untouched since the accident, with the smell of smoke still
lingering. There are pieces of metal dangling from the ceiling,
hotel papers stained with water and charred edges that still litter
what once were rooms.
   The accident happened when Maj. Bruce L. Teagarden, en route
from Pittsburgh to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, tried to land
his powerless fighter jet at the nearby Indianapolis International
Airport.
   Teagarden was making his second attempt at the runway when he
ejected and the A7-D Corsair plummeted, skipping off a bank
building before ramming into the lobby of the Ramada across the
street.
   Nine hotel employees were killed at the scene. A salesman who
had stopped to make a telephone call died several days later.
   Teagarden, who suffered only minor injuries, was cleared of any
wrongdoing.
   A memorial service arranged by the Marion County Sheriff's
Department was scheduled for later today.

   Republican George Bush renewed his criticism of Michael Dukakis
as inexperienced in foreign policy today, as Dukakis sought to
portray Bush as having no feeling for the problems of everyday
Americans.
   ``I'm never going to forget the people I've met during this
campaign _ people who need a helping hand, not a cold shoulder,''
Dukakis told telephone company workers in New Haven, Conn.
   ``George Bush doesn't care that working women earn only 64 cents
for every dollar that men earn,'' he said. ``George Bush doesn't
even know that almost 40 million Americans _ mostly working people
and their families _ don't have a dime's worth of health insurance.
... George Bush wants to help the people who already have it made.
I want to help every American family make it.''
   A day earlier, Dukakis accused the Republicans of distorting his
record on crime while front-runner Bush criticized the Democrat as
lacking needed foreign policy experience.
   The vice president returned to that topic today at a rally in
South River, N.J., saying the nation cannot afford to elect such a
president.
   He said Dukakis opposed the U.S. strike against Libya _ a
contention Dukakis denies.
   ``I believe that we've got to fight terrorism and if we ever
again face clear evidence of terrorist aggression, terrorist
involvement in the taking of American lives, as we did in the case
of Libya, I would not hesitate to strike again,'' Bush said. ``We
have got to punish state-sponsored terrorism.''
   Dukakis, criticized by some in his party for not responding more
strongly to GOP charges, angrily answered his Republican accusers
on Wednesday when presented with a brochure attacking him as soft
on crime.
   ``Friends, this is garbage,'' Dukakis said as he held up the
mailing for a crowd in Southern Illinois. ``This is political
garbage.''
   The GOP brochure, which was sent to voters in the state,
suggested that convicted mass-murderer John Wayne Gacy would ``be
eligible for weekend passes'' under Massachusetts' prison furlough
program.
   Later, in Palmyra, Mo., Dukakis told the crowd, ``I've never
seen such a pack of lies in my life.''
   Bush, meanwhile, said that Dukakis had ``an unrealistic view of
America's role'' in the world, and he told students at the
University of Michigan that he and the Massachusetts governor were
``light years apart'' on foreign policy.
   Today, Dukakis traveled to Connecticut where the latest
statewide poll showed Bush holding a 10-point lead.
   The two presidential candidates were expected to put aside their
political rhetoric and replace it with humor as they both took
center stage tonight at the annual Alfred E. Smith dinner in New
York City.
   The event traditionally calls for comedy _ not criticism _ from
the candidates.
   The Dukakis campaign, shaken earlier in the week by a NBC
News-Wall Street Journal poll showing Bush ahead by 17 points,
received better news on Wednesday from two new surveys.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll gave Bush a seven-point lead
while a Harris poll showed the GOP nominee leading by nine points _
considerably less than the earlier survey.
   The ABC-Post poll, conducted Oct. 12 through Tuesday, questioned
1,195 likely voters and had a margin of error of about three
percentage points either way. The Harris poll of 1,356 likely
voters was done Friday through Monday and had a margin of error of
three points.
   In an effort to cut the margin, Dukakis was planning a series of
television appearances, and his campaign was considering purchasing
blocks of TV time for either a speech by the candidate, a town
meeting style program or a national call-in show.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis used most of his campaign time for
counterattacks.
   ``My positions are being distorted on a number of these issues.
That seems to be what the Bush campaign is all about,'' Dukakis
told reporters.
   The Gacy brochure suggested that the man convicted and sentenced
to death in 1980 for murdering 33 young men and boys would be
eligible for a weekend pass in Massachusetts. The second brochure
by the Illinois Republican Party said in bold print, ``All the
Murderers and Rapists and Drug Pushers and Child Molesters in
Massachusetts Vote for Michael Dukakis.''
   ``This isn't worthy of a presidential campaign,'' Dukakis told
voters in Illinois.
   Aides to the governor said that Gacy would not be eligible for a
pass under the Massachusetts furlough program.
   The Democratic candidate, who toured the rural Midwest area by
bus, also charged that Bush cares more about ``corporate
operators'' than family farmers.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen today
renewed his criticism of the Republicans' negative campaign ads,
saying at a campaign stop in Louisville, Ky., ``I'm going to take
myself on an assignment. Every time they issue a falsehood ... I'm
going to take them on and straighten that one out.''
   Dan Quayle, the Republican vice presidential nominee, campaigned
today in Marietta, Ohio, promising jobs and prosperity if the GOP
wins. He said that already under the under the Reagan
administration there is ``a job for all who want to work.''

   Mayor Johnny Ford said he used karate
kicks to fend off two stray pit bull dogs that attacked him while
he was jogging and forced him to take refuge in a tree for 2{ hours.
   A passer-by came to Ford's aid Wednesday, and shot the dogs with
a pistol.
   The mayor said he then beat the dogs with a tree limb until they
were dead.
   When the dogs attacked, ``I battled them with my hands and feet
by using karate kicks as best I could to keep them at bay,'' Ford
said. ``The dogs were so vicious they momentarily turned on each
other and that gave me time to get to a tree.''
   Ford, who was bitten on the legs, arms and hands, was treated at
a hospital and released.
   ``I'm OK,'' Ford said. ``I'm not bitten up that bad. The most
important thing is they were not rabid.''

   Members of a Food and Drug Administration
panel responsible for a delay in approving a drug that breaks down
blood clots say there is no room for emotionalism in the handling
of new drugs.
   Dr. Peter R. Kowey of the Medical College of Pennsylvania, in
Philadelphia, and other members of the panel took the unusual step
of writing an article about their action for Friday's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   They described pressure from the public, press and
pharmaceutical companies to recommend FDA approval of the drug TPA,
or tissue plasminogen activator.
   The pressure included an editorial in The Wall Street Journal
calling for the immediate release of TPA despite researcher
concerns. The editorial argued that the panel's decision to
postpone approval would ``sacrifice thousands of American lives on
an altar of pedantry.''
   Following the panel's decision, the FDA requested additional
information from the drug's manufacturer, Genentech Inc. of South
San Francisco. A second and third panel reconsidered the drug and
finally gave approval in November 1987, six months after the
decision to postpone the OK.
   TPA is an enzyme used to break down blood clots, particularly in
the vessels feeding the heart muscle following a heart attack. As
with other clot-dissolving drugs, recipients risk internal bleeding.
   Kowey said the panel members decided to reply to the criticisms
because of the complex reasons for their decision and the attention
it received.
   ``People began to lose sight of what the facts were,'' he said.
``Emotionalism can be very dangerous to the public. All the
physicians knew was that we had turned down the drug. This (the
article) gives us a way to tell people what we were thinking.''
   Kowey said the panel had ``very real concerns'' that the drug
might cause excessive bleeding. Based on the available data, the
members decided that ``the presumed benefit of the therapy might be
unacceptably mitigated by its risk.''
   Kowey said he thought the medical journal article could help
educate physicians treating patients who do not understand the FDA
approval process.
   ``The FDA, to its credit, did not succumb to the media
campaign,'' the authors wrote. ``Commissioner (Frank) Young and his
staff endorsed the committee's findings, but, most appropriately,
did promise to expedite review of any new information the sponsor
wished to present in support of the application.''
   The authors maintain the panel made the correct decision in
recommending a delay.
   ``Although the decision-making process is complex, maintaining
an objective attitude is mandatory to ensure that safe and
effective drug products reach the marketplace,'' according to the
authors. ``The public airing of problems having to do with this and
other new drug applications and the strong stand taken by the
committee and the FDA should convince industry, the medical
community, and the public that the method of drug review is sound.''
   In the past two years, public outcry has successfully prodded
the FDA to speed up the approval process of drugs that could help
patients suffering from serious diseases.
   Young announced Wednesday a new plan to reduce the time required
for human testing of drugs for life-threatening and severely
debilitating diseases, which he said included severe heart disease,
AIDS, Parkinson's disease, deadly cancers and blindness.
   Young said the TPA experience played a crucial role in the new
FDA policy, as agency officials learned they could intervene in the
drug development process to hasten approval by asking pointed
questions and eliminating unnecessary research.

   The government today proposed ending the right of
criminal suspects in Northern Ireland to remain silent as part of a
new crackdown on the Irish Republican Army.
   The measure, which will end a historic right dating from the
17th century, was put forward immediately in the Commons and is
likely to become law within three months.
   The annoucement by Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King came a
day after the government banned broadcast interviews with members
of the outlawed IRA and 10 other militant Roman Catholic and
Protestant groups in Northern Ireland.
   The measure announced today applies to all criminal suspects in
Northern Ireland, but it is aimed at terrorist suspects.
   Another Cabinet minister, Douglas Hurd, said the government is
considering introducing similar legislation to end suspects' right
to silence in England and Wales.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party has a huge
majority in the 650-member Commons, so the measures are likely to
be approved.
   King, in a statement accompanying his announcement to Commons,
said:
   ``Members of terrorist organizations are being trained to refuse
to respond to questions put by the police _ and this technique is
increasingly being adopted by those suspected of serious crimes,
including racketeering. Justice is being thwarted.''
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of the majority
Protestant province of Northern Ireland and unite it with the
Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   This is the first time a British government has announced it
will introduce laws to end the right to silence.
   Courts now are not allowed to take into consideration that a
suspect refused to answer police interrogation.
   In a written statement to the Commons, King said under the new
law a judge will be able to draw ``whatever inferences appear
proper'' from the fact that a suspect refused to answer police
questions.
   Sources said judges and juries will be able to conclude that a
suspect's silence is an indication of guilt, particularly if the
suspect produces a detailed defense in court after refusing to
answer police questions.
   King said the Republic of Ireland also has restricted the right
to silence of suspects as part of its drive against the IRA.
   Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, said the measure
``effectively moves that (British) government closer to the
governments of Chile and South Africa.''
   ``The right to silence is a century-old civil liberty, enshrined
in the legal systems of most of the world's civilized countries,''
Sinn Fein said in a statement.
   Spokesman Kevin McNamara of the opposition Labor Party said in a
radio interview, ``Northern Ireland is being used as a laboratory
for draconian measures to be used later in other parts of the
United Kingdom.''
   In addition to ending the right to silence, the government has
said it plans legislation this winter enabling it to freeze and
seize the funds of terrorist organizations.
   It also plans to require candidates in Northern Ireland
elections to take an oath disavowing violence.
   This is aimed at Sinn Fein, which is formally committed to
``armed struggle'' to unite Northern Ireland with the Republic of
Ireland under a leftist administration. But the Sinn Fein
leadership says it will have no problem taking a no-violence oath.
   Hurd on Wednesday banned radio and television interviews with
members of the mainly Roman Catholic IRA, Sinn Fein, the Ulster
Defense Association, a militant Protestant organization, and other
Northern Ireland groups.
   The ban, which was imposed by decree and did not require
legislation, provoked an immedate outcry from opposition and civil
liberties groups.
   But Hurd, the Cabinet minister responsible for broadcasting,
said: ``The government has decided that the time has now come to
deny this easy platform to those who use it to propagate
terrorism.''
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said the move set a ``damaging
precedent'' but, like the other British network, the commercially
funded Independent Television, said it would comply.
   Sinn Fein likened the ban to Soviet bloc censorship.
   Timothy Renton, deputy minister of the Home Office, told
American reporters in London: ``The whole aim of this (ban)... is
to remove that extra weapon _ the ability to go on television
immediately afterwards to speak in justification of an explosion or
a bomb.''
   The ban, which follows closely a 15-year ban on IRA and Sinn
Fein interviews in the Republic of Ireland, does not affect foreign
networks or the British print media.
   Sinn Fein, which gets about one-third of the vote of the
Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, has one member in the
British Commons, Gerry Adams, who has never attended, and about 70
members on local Northern Ireland councils.

   While George Bush warns against
overconfidence by his supporters, evidence abounds that the
cautionary note is not sinking in with his entourage. Many are
convinced he'll be living in the White House come January.
   A local Secret Service agent matter-of-factly provided a typical
example this week.
   He walked up to Bush's official photographer, David Valdez, in
the hallway of a hotel where Bush holed up before a late afternoon
speech.
   The agent said he had a friend who was chaplain for a New York
police organization and this chaplain ``wants to know if he can
represent them at the inauguration. Who should he talk to?''
   Valdez, mindful of his boss's public admonition that any member
of the campaign who shows overconfidence or signs of letting up in
the final push ``is history,'' made no comment on the man's
request. Instead he tactfully suggested the agent look for some of
the traveling campaign staff.

   Bush later spoke at a local high school where some of Michael
Dukakis' supporters showed that a bit of this year's political
lexicon has made the crossover from campaign jargon to everyday
usage.
   As Bush's motorcade rolled by the line of Dukakis demonstraters
outside Heritage High School, two raised a large cardboard sign
that read, ``Spin this, Atwater.''
   Spin is the word for what political operatives often do when
talking to reporters _ they evaluate the current political
situation or a given event in terms that serve their campaign's
strategy and make their candidate look as good as possible.
   Spinning has a negative connotation among people who see it as
attempted manipulation or outright deception.
   Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, is one of the masters of
spin.
   Atwater, who does not generally travel with the campaign,
happened to be on the road with Bush this day. When a TV crew got
the sign and showed it to him, he laughed and seemed quite pleased
at the acknowledgement of his speciality.
   He later raised the sign aloft in the press bus while asking if
anyone had any questions, and continued the day's spinning in the
campaign plane later with the sign perched atop his seat.

   A U.S. appeals court has denied Ferdinand E.
Marcos' bid to avoid the threat of jail for failing to comply with
grand jury subpoenas, and President Reagan reportedly is refusing
to intervene.
   At the White House today, the president declined to discuss the
case. ``I just don't want to get into the subject because it is
something that may not come to my desk at all,'' he said when asked
if he would intervene.
   The Los Angeles Times reported today that the president has
decided not to intervene on Marcos' behalf.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday upheld a
lower court finding against the ousted Philippines president and
his wife, Imelda, that subjects them to possible arrest for civil
contempt of court.
   Marcos, 71, and his 59-year-old wife have been targets of a
federal grand jury probe investigating charges that Marcos
allegedly diverted enormous sums of government money to secret bank
accounts after he fled the Philippines. In August the couple balked
at complying with a series of subpoenas, prompting the contempt
charge by Judge John Walker.
   Generally, persons found in civil contempt can be jailed for the
life of the grand jury, usually about 18 months, or until they
comply with the court's directive, whichever comes first.
   But U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, whose office is conducting
the investigation, refused to comment on what steps might be taken.
   Reagan also was asked today if he had promised Marcos a ``safe
haven'' in the United States. The president replied, ``I couldn't
have made a blanket statement of that kind.''
   The president based his decision of non-interference on evidence
indicating that Marcos allegedly diverted U.S. aid money to the
Philippines for his own use after he fled his country and took
refuge in the United States at Reagan's invitation, the Los Angeles
Times reported earlier today.
   Meanwhile, in the Philippines, President Corazon Aquino said
today that U.S. prosecution of Marcos would hasten her government's
recovery of the billions of dollars he allegedly plundered during
his 20-year rule.
   Mrs. Aquino said U.S. authorities had not informed her whether
they plan to arrest Marcos.
   The chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government
said last week he may delay filing criminal charges here against
Marcos so the United States could go ahead with its own prosecution.
   Mrs. Aquino's government has long been threatening to indict
Marcos on criminal charges but so far has filed 39 civil suits
against him seeking to collect $96.7 billion in damages.
   Officials say in private that criminal charges have not been
filed because of fears that Marcos' return would destabilize Mrs.
Aquino's administration. The Philippine Constitution prohibits
trial in absentia.
   Several times since taking refuge in Hawaii in February 1986,
Marcos has personally appealed to Reagan for help with his legal
problems, and Mrs. Marcos sent Nancy Reagan a handwritten letter in
September 1986, the Times said.
   The two-page letter asked Mrs. Reagan for her ``invaluable help
to prevent'' the couple from being deposed under court order by
attorneys for the Philippines government, said the Times, which
obtained a copy of the letter.
   ``I understand that a `suggestion' from the `White House' or the
`State Dept.' could prevent these indignities to an ally and
friend,'' Mrs. Marcos wrote, according to the Times.
   A grand jury in New York has been investigating since June 1986
whether the Marcoses violated federal racketeering laws, according
to the appeals court's 21-page opinion.
   ``Essentially the government believes the (Marcoses) _ and
others acting in concert with them _ fraudulently diverted enormous
sums of money that belonged to the Philippine government and the
government of the United States, which money was intended for the
benefit of the Philippine people,'' the three-member appeals court
wrote, outlining the allegations against Marcos and his wife.
   Specifically, the grand jury was investigating reports that the
couple or their agents may have used embezzled funds to buy real
estate and other items in the United States and transferred other
misappropriated money to secret Swiss bank accounts.
   ``The grand jury has not handed down any indictments,'' the
appeals court noted.
   The subpoenas sought the Marcoses' fingerprints, palm prints,
voice and handwriting examples, along with their authorization for
foreign banks to turn over their financial records.
   When the couple refused, claiming through their lawyers that
they still retained head-of-state immunity, prosecutors presented
an Aug. 9 diplomatic note from the Philippines government waiving
``any immunity that the Marcoses might possess.''
   The appeals court, in an opinion written by Circuit Judge
Richard J. Cardamone, noted that the language of the Philippines
government's waiver of the Marcoses' immunity ``could scarcely be
stronger'' and therefore thwarted the couple's claim.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis struck back at
George Bush's negative attacks today by comparing his Republican
rival's campaign to the Watergate cover-up of the Nixon White House.
   ``Truth was the first casualty in the Nixon White House and it
was the first casualty in the Bush campaign,'' Dukakis said in a
speech to Southern New England Telephone Co. employees.
   ``I believe the American people value the truth in politics and
I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the truth wins,'' he
said.
   In campaign appearances in Illinois and Missouri on Wednesday,
Dukakis denounced Republican campaign literature as ``garbage'' and
``a pack of lies.''
   The Massachusetts governor also stressed his commitment to
family values and the concerns of working Americans today, and said
Bush was both unknowing and uncaring.
   ``I'm never going to forget the people I've met during this
campaign,'' Dukakis said. ``People who need a helping hand, not a
cold shoulder.''
   Dukakis flew to Connecticut after three days of campaigning in
the Middle West and was immediately asked about a Hartford Courant
poll which said he was trailing Bush by 10 percentage points in
this New England state that borders his home state of Massachusetts.
   ``You know the polls. They go up and down,'' he responded.
   In his speech to the telephone workers, Dukakis said:
   ``George Bush doesn't care that working women earn only 64 cents
for every dollar that men earn. ...
   ``George Bush doesn't even know that almost 40 million Americans
_ mostly working people and their families _ don't have a dime's
worth of health insurance. ...
   ``George Bush wants to help the people who already have it made.
I want to help every American family make it.''
   The Democratic nominee described his family as ``more precious
to me than anything in the world. And no matter what else one has
in life, there's nothing more important than that.''
   Later today, Dukakis was heading to New York to film campaign
commercials and attend the annual Alfred E. Smith charity dinner,
where he will share the spotlight with Bush.
   The dinner, sponsored by the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New
York, customarily attracts the presidential candidates of both
major parties, who are under instructions to keep their remarks
humorous rather than political.
   On Wednesday, during a bus tour through rural southern Illinois
and Missouri, Dukakis erupted angrily over a steady barrage of
Republican attacks on the Massachusetts prison furlough program.
   Dukakis campaign officials, trying to counter the damage done by
Bush crime ads, were considering airing their own commercial.
   With Dukakis admittedly trailing Bush in these closing weeks of
the campaign, his strategists also were looking for ways to get his
message out to voters and close the gap.
   ``We're playing with different ways to more dramatically
communicate with people,'' said Dukakis adviser Leslie Dach.
   Among those under consideration were buying five minutes on the
major television networks for a Dukakis speech, and the purchase of
larger blocks of time _ as long as 30 minutes _ for either a town
meeting style program or a national call-in show.
   ``All sorts of different options are being weighed,'' said press
secretary Dayton Duncan.
   In the effort to widen his audience, Dukakis also was appearing
on the ABC show ``Good Morning America'' on Friday and probably
would be on the ABC program ``Nightline'' next week.
   Dukakis and Bush were invited to separate interviews on
``Nightline,'' but the vice president declined.
   The Democratic nominee got mixed news on the polling front.
   A new ABC News-Washington Post poll released Wednesday said Bush
was leading Dukakis by seven points, a margin cheered by the
Democratic candidate's aides who were looking for any sign that a
recent NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll that had the margin at 17
points was incorrect.
   A Louis Harris poll said the Bush lead was nine points. A week
earlier, the same survey said Bush was leading by two points.
   Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas said the candidate
decided to respond forcefully to the Republican attacks after he
was shown material mailed to voters by the Illinois Republican
Party.
   ``All The Murderers, and Rapists, and Drug Pushers and Child
Molesters in Massachusetts Vote for Mike Dukakis,'' a brochure was
headlined in bold type.
   The material alleged that convicts in Massachusetts have the
right to vote.
   It cited the governor's opposition to the death penalty and his
support for the state's controversial prison furlough program.
   In Quincy, Ill., Dukakis held up the GOP campaign material and
told an outdoor rally, ``This is garbage, this is political
garbage.''
   ``This isn't worthy of a presidential campaign.''

<HEAD>Sources Say Iran Has Withdrawn Speedboats From Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NABILA MEGALLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has withdrawn all its armed
speedboats from a Persian Gulf island that was a major base for
attacks on merchant shipping, diplomatic sources said Thursday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 20 to 25
speedboats were withdrawn recently from Abu Musa island in the
southern gulf.
   ``Not a single speedboat is now in the vicinity of Abu Musa,''
one source said.
   The speedboats at Abu Musa were mainly Swedish-built Boghammar
Marin craft armed with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenade
launchers and anti-aircraft cannon.
   Abu Musa, 30 miles off the coast of the United Arab Emirates,
was one of the principal bases for speedboat operations.
   U.S. and other foreign warships steered clear of the 12-mile
territorial limit claimed by Iran around Abu Musa and other islands
along the 600-mile gulf.
   Iran has a speedboat base on Farsi island in the northern gulf,
but shipping attacks from there ceased late last year and did not
resume until just before a cease-fire took effect Aug. 20 in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   Since the cease-fire, Tehran has been trying to improve
relations with its Arab neighbors in the gulf and ease tensions in
the waterway.
   Tehran has moved to normalize relations with Kuwait, which it
accused of aiding Iraq during the eight-year war.
   Iran's parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, has indicated
Tehran seeks to restore relations with Saudi Arabia, which severed
relations in April, citing Iranian subversion and terrorism.
   There has been a decrease in Iranian interceptions of merchant
ships suspected of carrying war-related materials to Iraq.
   The moves are seen as part of an effort by Iran to appear more
flexibile than Iraq in peace talks aimed at ending the war. The
talks began in August but are deadlocked.
   Naval and shipping officials say there have been no Iranian
stop-and-search interceptions since the cease-fire took effect.
Before that, Iranians were stopping scores of vessels each month.
   Iranian warships in the Strait of Hormuz, the entry to the gulf,
still question commercial vessels by radio about their destinations
and cargoes. This is legal under maritime law until the warring
nations sign a formal peace treaty.
   Some gulf-based shipping executives said these Iranian radio
interrogations have dropped to one-third of what they used to be.
The sources also said Iranian warships are now seldom sighted in
the southern gulf, where they had been most active.
   The Iranians had fortified Abu Musa with tanks, but these were
withdrawn for use elsewhere in ground fighting, U.S. officers said
recently.
   There were indications earlier this year that the Iranians were
building a launching site for Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship
missiles on the island. But as far as is known, it was never
finished.
   Some 550 ships were sunk or damaged in the ``tanker war'' and
more than 300 seamen killed.
   U.S. officers have credited the presence of attack helicopters
and boats from two secret U.S. bases off Saudi Arabia with stopping
the attacks.

<HEAD>President Says Nicaragua Should Be Pressured Into Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Honduran president said other
nations should pressure Nicaragua ``to become a democracy'' and
blamed the Sandinista regime for the hundreds of thousands of
refugees from the civil war.
   President Jose Azcona Hoya said 55,000 Nicaraguans are in
refugee camps along his country's southern border, in addition to
about 8,000 Contras who retreated after U.S. military aid ended in
February.
   Azcona Hoya blamed Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government for
the problem. ``A government that creates refugees and political
exiles cannot be a good government,'' he said in an interview
Tuesday.
   He said there must be an ``international reaction to pressure
Nicaragua into a political solution'' of the problem.
   ``Let us assume that (President) Reagan was wrong and his
policies of support for the Contras were wrong. Well, now the
United States is stepping aside. There is no more military aid,''
Azcona Hoya said.
   ``What is to be done? Other countries must become involved and
force Nicaragua to become a democratic country. It is time the
democratic countries of the world take a firm stand on this,'' he
said.
   The Contras are receiving non-military aid under a $17 million
program Congress approved in March, the same month Nicaragua's
leftist government and the Contras began a cease-fire. The truce is
still in place, but peace talks that would lead to a permanent
solution have broken down.
   Last month, Honduras issued a call at the United Nations for a
peace force involving Canada, Spain and West Germany to patrol its
borders with Nicaragua and El Salvador. Few believe the proposal
will be carried out.
   Azcona Hoyo called it ``a drastic move to show that we are not
interested in attacking Nicaragua,'' whose government ``has not
acted like someone concerned about peace.
   ``When they could push for a dialogue, they have toughened their
stand internally, jailing political opponents. Now that the Contra
is silenced completely they go to the opposite side and do not try
to look for reconciliation.''
   Honduras, the recipient of substantial U.S. military aid, hosts
U.S. military forces and has long harbored Contras in their war
against the Sandinistas. More than 1,000 U.S. soldiers are
stationed in Honduras.
   The United States has built installations in Honduras to monitor
activity in Nicaragua and staged joint military exercises with
Honduras. The Americans have directed Honduran troops to the border
at least once to repel Nicaraguan troops chasing Contras.
   More than 200,000 Nicaraguans live in Honduras, a nation of 5
million people. Honduras is also home to tens of thousands of
refugees from the civil war in neighboring El Salvador.

Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Families affected by a church bus
crash that killed 27 people have begun cooperating with a Hollywood
production company interested in making a television movie or
miniseries about the accident.
   Bill Nichols, whose son died in the May 14 wreck, said he and
members of the other families realized ``somebody's going to make a
movie of it, and we wanted to have some input.''
   A representative of Krantz Productions Inc. of Studio City,
Calif., is expected to meet with the families next month.
   Nichols said the families and Krantz want to emphasize the
danger of driving under the influence of alcohol.
   Larry Mahoney, 35, was allegedly drunk and was driving the wrong
way on Interstate 71 when his pickup truck collided with a Radcliff
church bus carrying 63 youths and four adults near Carrollton.
Twenty-seven people, including 24 of the youths, died during a fire
that erupted soon after impact, and many others were injured.
   Mahoney returned Oct. 10 to his parents' home in Owen County
after relatives and friends provided $540,000 in cash and property
to secure his appearance in court.
   He is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 9 in Carroll Circuit Court
on 27 counts of murder, 13 counts of first-degree assault, 44
counts of wanton endangerment and one count of driving under the
influence.
   Krantz spokesman Brian LaPan said Tuesday that the company was
still developing the project. He said representatives will discuss
various aspects of the movie with the families sometime after the
producer returns late next week from Europe.
   Nichols said his contact with Krantz indicated ``the movie will
focus on a few of the individuals on the bus.''
   The families will suggest some people to spotlight, he said,
such as Lee Williams, whose wife and two daughters died on the bus;
John Pearman, the bus driver who died, and Christy Pearman, his
daughter who was burned and had severe problems with smoke
inhalation; Carey Aurentz, a girl who had to have a foot amputated;
and the families who lost their only children.

<HEAD>Mspi Farmers Fined for Pumping Water During Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Mississippi Delta farmers have been
fined by the state Department of Natural Resources for violating
bans on irrigation during this past summer's drought.
   In a related development, the Commission on Natural Resources
has voted to ban irrigation pumping from several other Delta rivers
and bayous because of continued low water.
   Officials said the ban would not affect growing crops at this
time of year but would restrict manmade flooding for waterfowl
habitat.
   The bans are the latest in a series of restrictions on water use
in a region of the state once known for its abundance of water.
   The drought lowered water in the Delta, which normally drains
into the Mississippi River, and streams which flow into it are too
low to replenish it.
   ``We have one heck of a problem with water in the Delta,'' said
Commissioner Robert Travis of Jackson.
   During its Wednesday session, the commission imposed a reduced
fine on the only Delta farmer to request a hearing on the summer's
irrigation ban violations.
   Donald Aylward of Pace, manager of Laban Planting Co., said he
felt the fines for violating orders banning pumping from Delta
streams were unreasonable.
   The commission voted to reduce Aylward's fine to $1,500 because
he agreed to pump well water from one of his upstream farms into
the Bogue Phalia River to replace water he was pumping from the
river downstream. He had faced a maximum fine of $6,000.
   Six other farmers were fined the maximum.

   An off-duty policeman heard a radio
report that a Bank of New England branch office had been robbed,
and he had a hunch about where the crooks might go.
   Lt. Donald Murphy, who was at home when he heard the report
Tuesday, sped to the South Shore Plaza mall because he thought the
robbers might go there to switch cars.
   His hunch paid off when he spotted four men running down a slope
from a highway to the mall parking lot.
   Murphy watched the four split up into two getaway cars. He used
his portable radio to call for backup and then followed one of the
cars into Quincy.
   After a chase, another car blocked the car Murphy was following
and he was able to arrest two men.
   The suspects in the other car, believed to have contained the
$30,000 stolen from the bank, were not caught.
   Two guns and a police radio receiver were found in the trunk of
the car Murphy chased. Murphy said the suspects apparently stopped
monitoring police activity on the radio after the robbery.
   ``They thought they had it made,'' he said. ``They thought they
were going to drive right out of this.''
   Thomas M. Kavanaugh, 29, and John J. Maguire, 39, both of
Boston, were arraigned Wednesday in Quincy District Court on
charges of armed robbery while masked and illegal possession of a
firearm.
   Murphy said both men are convicted felons with extensive records.

   A Lufthansa jumbo jet carrying

with its nose stuck in grass, but no one was injured, airline
officials said.
   The accident occurred at the Duesseldorf airport about 2 p.m. as

   The jet, carrying 75 passengers and 13 crewmembers, stopped
``with its nose wheel stuck in a wet grassy area just off the end

   Airline spokeswoman Heidi Buchheister said the plane was flying
from Frankfurt to Toronto, via Duesseldorf.
   Lufthansa said the pilot reported poor braking conditions ``due
to water standing on the runway.''
   Duesseldorf is about 125 miles north of Frankfurt.

   With 41 American cruise missiles sliced up
like split steel bananas, Soviet inspectors who observed the
destruction under provisions of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty began their trip home today.
   The 11 Soviets, including military and civilian members of the
Soviet Union's on-site inspection agency, rested at Davis-Monthan
Air Force Base before departing this morning about a U.S. military
jet.
   They planned to fly to Travis Air Force Base near San Francisco,
where some planned to go to the Soviets' permanent treaty
monitoring site at Magna, Utah, before returning to Moscow, said
U.S. Air Force Col. Larry Jones.
   On Tuesday and Wednesday, three civilian American teams at
Davis-Monthan's Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center
worked around the clock with handheld saws and plasma arc torches.
   In 28 hours they completed the task of cutting in half the first
batch of 41 Air Force ground-launched cruise missiles, 41
protective canisters and seven launch vehicles, called transporter
erector launchers, putting an end to the destructive potential of
weapons once capable of delivering nuclear warheads.
   The warheads, along with fuel and guidance systems, had been
removed before the dismantling process, with the nuclear armaments
being turned over to the Department of Energy for storage,
officials said.
   The last of the 41 missiles was dismantled Wednesday evening
with the Soviets watching, said Capt. Chuck Roque, an Air Force
spokesman. Original target time for completing the cuts was Friday,
72 hours after the Soviets' arrival Tuesday.
   Under the INF Treaty, 443 Air Force land-based cruise missiles,
many of which have been deployed in Europe, are to be destroyed
within the pact's first three years. In addition, 403 Army Pershing
missiles are slated for destruction, along with 1,846 Soviet
missiles of six types.

   Hispanic leaders on Thursday charged both
presidential candidates with ignoring issues affecting Hispanics,
black and the poor to avoid being labeled liberal.
   ``Neither candidate or campaign has done a reasonable job of
addressing these concerns or articulating an economic agenda that
will lift us out of the height of economic depression,'' said Ruben
Bonilla Jr., general counsel of the League of United Latin American
Citizens, a Hispanic umbrella organization.
   ``We believe they are not addressing the issues because they
don't want to antagonize or offend the Anglo community,'' LULAC
president Jose Garcia De Lara told a press conference.
   ``We want to hear them say what we are going to do to eliminate
poverty in this country, what governmental beneficial programs are
we going to initiate, what are we going to do about the lack of
affordable housing?'' he said.
   De Lara mentioned Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' housing
plan based on cashing in an Individual Retirement Account to use as
a down payment on a house.
   ``The problem is that the poor do not have IRAs _ this shows how
out of touch these candidates are,'' he said.
   Bonilla singled out for criticism Dan Quayle, the Republican
vice presidential nominee.
   He said the Indiana senator has ``the most regressive voting
record on Capitol Hill,'' noting the candidate's opposition to
bilingual education, voting rights act, bilingual ballot, child
nuturition programs and his support of taxing certain veteran's
benefits.
   De Lara said the organization does not plan to formally endorse
any candidate.

   Police on Thursday arrested 19 candle-carrying
demonstrators from Minnesota who crowded into Sen. Dan Quayle's
office on Capitol Hill to demand more aid to the homeless.
   ``Sen. Quayle has consistently voted against affordable housing
in the last eight years,'' Steve O'Neil of Duluth, Minn., told
reporters in a hallway of the Hart Senate Office Building.
   Homeless activists have been arrested daily for the past three
weeks for demonstrating at the Capitol. Earlier, they carried away
furniture from the office of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., in a
symbolic ``eviction'' and chanted slogans in the Senate gallery.
   On Thursday, the Capitol Police were waiting for the
demonstrators when they descended on the office of the Republican
vice presidential candidate, an Indiana senator.
   The police allowed the demonstrators to light candles in
Quayle's office and unfurl a large banner in his window that could
be seen from scores of other Senate offices.
   ``A thousand points of light or a million lives,'' the banner
said, referring to Republican nominee George Bush's ``thousand
points of light'' campaign theme about private, voluntary social
programs.
   Quayle was campaigning in Ohio on Thursday. His office staff
continued working without looking at the demonstrators, who urged
passage of legislation that would provide $25 billion to house the
homeless.
   About 15 minutes after the protest began, the police moved in
and arrested the 19 demonstrators. They were charged with unlawful
entry and demonstrating in a Capitol building, punishable by a
maximum $5,000 fine and six months in jail.
   They were to be arraigned in D.C. Superior Court.
   Like others arrested in recent homeless demonstrations, the
Minnesotans said they were loosely affiliated with the
Washington-based Community for Creative Non-Violence. That
organization's leader, Mitch Snyder, has had a long-running feud
with the Reagan administration over assistance to the homeless.

   One ``big cheese'' at the
recommissioning of the USS Wisconsin this weekend won't be in
uniform or making a speech.
   A 500-pound block of fine Wisconsin Cheddar will weigh in as a
mighty 5-foot-long replica of the 58,000-ton battleship, which was
refurbished at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula.
   For 25-year-old Allen Hendricks, who gets to sculpt the $1,000
hunk, the job is the project of a lifetime.
   ``I've made a totem pole out of provolone and the leaning Tower
of Pisa is popular,'' Hendricks said. ``But it's not every day you
get to work with a 500-pound block of cheese.
   ``This is by far the biggest project I've done _ as far as the
event, the project itself and of course, as far as the cheese.''
   Hendricks' sculpture will be the star attraction Saturday at the
reception after the recommissioning.
   The cheese came courtesy of the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board,
which will supply all the cheese at the reception.
   But this particular cheese is special, according to Hendricks.
It is completely hand-made, from start to finish _ including the
cloth wrappings that allow it to ripen naturally.
   Hendricks, who was flown in from Washington for the project,
spent 60 hours just planning and drawing designs.
   He plans to sculpt the guns and turrets from cheese and get
details such as radar antennae with bamboo and wire.
   Hendricks also plans to chip the massive base of the sculpture
so that the white streaks in the cheese will look like water.
   As for all the cheese he chips away, Hendricks said, ``To the
best of my knowledge, I'll probably have a cheese sandwich for
lunch.''

   The thought of slow-moving ducks
waddling on a curved road without protection was too much for Tim
White, so he shelled out the money for new crossing signs after the
originals were stolen.
   ``I just couldn't sleep at night thinking there is Bluff City
without any duck signs. It's your moral obligation to jump in and
do what you have to,'' the owner of White Advertising said.
   White said the warnings will have an added feature, a reflective
finish.
   ``It's one of those things that applies to my trade, which is
signs,'' he said. ``It's part of smelling the roses.''
   Ducks congregate along the stretch of road near Boone Lake and
often wander into the road. Mayor Billy Wells and another volunteer
paid $52 for the first set in May, fearing for the birds' safety.
Wells first tried to charge the city, but aldermen complained the
signs were a needless expense.

<NOTE>Eds: American elm is cq</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's official now. The mammoth elm that
has graced the Pottawatomie County landscape for what could be a
century has been declared the biggest American elm tree in the
United States by the American Forestry Association.
   Gary Naughton, the state extension forester who first measured
the elm in 1978, said he received a call Tuesday from the AFA
informing him that the tree, named the Louis Vieux Elm, was back on
top.
   The Louis Vieux was declared the biggest American elm in the
United States in 1985. The next year, a 125-foot tree in Virginia
unseated the Kansas elm, located on the Vermillion River between
Manhattan and Topeka, Kan.
   Now the Virginia tree has succumbed to Dutch elm disease, but
Virginians are not about to give up yet, Naughton said.
   ``The people in Virginia are just convinced that Virginia has
the biggest tree,'' he said. ``They're out in the woods every day
looking. For the moment, we're official.''
   Naughton said he thought the Louis Vieux eventually would have
bypassed the tree in Virginia on its own.
   The Louis Vieux was last measured three growing seasons ago in
May 1986. At the time, it was 96 feet tall, with a trunk
circumference of 299 inches and an average crown spread of 124 feet.

<HEAD>Emperor's Blood Pressure Drops Briefly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure and pulse dropped
sharply Thursday, but the vital signs later returned to normal as
the ailing monarch's internal bleeding continued.
   Hirohito, 87, discharged more blood and was given emergency
transfusions, but was resting peacefully by nightfall, an imperial
palace spokesman said.
   Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60 in the afternoon
to 112 over 50 by evening, and his pulse from 104 per minute in the
morning to 84 in the evening, said Kenji Maeda, chief of the
Imperial Household Agency's General Affairs Division.
   ``The emperor's blood pressure has returned to what is normal
for him, and the head court physician says he is not worried,''
Maeda said.
   One of Hirohito's daughters, Atsuko Ikeda, said Wednesday the
emperor had coughed severely during her visit to him and had hardly
responded to her.
   On Thursday morning, Hirohito's two sons, Crown Prince Akihito
and Prince Hitachi, visited him, and he was fully conscious and
alert, a senior palace source said.
   The monarch has been bedridden for a month with an intestinal
hemorrhage.
   There was renewed bleeding Thursday and the pace of the
discharges was quickening, Maeda said.
   Hirohito has received nearly 22{ pints of blood since his
illness worsened Sept. 19, and the transfusions had put a strain on
Hirohito's heart and kidneys, Maeda said without elaborating.
   The only solid food Hirohito has eaten since falling ill are a
few spoonfuls of porridge. Otherwise he is being fed intravenously,
which gives him 600-700 calories a day, said the senior palace
official, who refused to be identified.
   Before his illness, Hirohito was taking about 1,300 calories
daily, the official said.
   The emperor complains of fatigue but does not appear to be in
pain, he said.
   Crown Princess Michiko, Hirohito's daughter-in-law, scaled down
celebrations for her 54th birthday Thursday, canceling a
traditional birthday news conference, another palace official said.
She planned a quiet gathering with members of the imperial family,
the official said.

   Thousands of Serbs rallied in
ethnically troubled Kosovo province Thursday against a setback
dealt their nationalist leader, and they jeered two Politburo
members who tried to address them.
   Parliament eased an unpopular austerity program, allowing salary
increases for some workers that will compensate in part for the
annual inflation rate of 217 percent.
   Weeks of strikes and turmoil over ethnic and economic problems
have threatened the stability of Yugoslavia, a fragile federation
of several nationalities whose leadership has been weak since
President Tito died in 1980.
   About 5,000 people in a historic suburb of Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, taunted Politburo members Marko Orlandic and Kacusa Jasari
with chants of ``Thieves!'' and ``You betrayed the people!''
   They turned their backs when the party leaders tried to speak,
and police hustled Orlandic and Mrs. Jasari away when Serbs tried
to mob them.
   A crowd police estimated at more than 20,000 gathered nearby for
a later rally protesting a blow by the national party leadership to
the effort by Slobodan Milosevic, Communist Party chief of the
Serbian republic, to gain more control over Kosovo.
   The southern province, heart of ancient Serbia, borders Albania
and ethnic Albanians now make up 90 percent of the population.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure. Serbia
is the largest republic and both provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina,
are part of it but not fully subject to its control.
   Tito put the decentralized system of government in his 1974
constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway after his
death, but the result has been ineffective government by compromise.
   Dusan Ckrebic, a Serbian communist closely identified with
Milosevic, lost a secret confidence vote Wednesday at the end of a
three-day session of the national party Central Committee.
   He was the only one of 10 Politburo members subject to the vote
who did not get a majority in the 165-member Central Committee and
has offered to resign. The vote was seen as a defeat for Milosevic.
   At the larger rally Thursday, Serbs chanted ``We will not give
up Ckrebic!'' ``We will not give up Dusan!'' and ``Central
Committee members, you have shown your true faces!''
   Kosovo's 200,000 Serbs and Montenegrins had hoped the Central
Committee would dismiss some ethnic Albanians jfrom the Kosovo
party leadership.
   No action was taken, however, nor were measures announced
against what the minority describes as constant harassment from
ethnic Albanians. Thousands of Slavs have left the province since
1981, when at least nine people were killed in an outburst of
ethnic violence.
   Orlandic and Mrs. Jasari, head of the Kosovo Communist Party,
tried to placate the angry crowd in Kosovo Polje, built on the site
of a 14th century battle in which the Serbs defeated the Turks.
   Few listened and after about an hour some Serbs tried to grab
the microphone. The Politburo members were driven away in their
black limousine, down a side street under police escort.
   Miloslav Minicof the Serbian Central Committee promised those
attending the later rally that their demands for the ouster of Azem
Vlasi, an ethnic Albanian party leader in Kosovo, would be
considered by the federal leadership. The crowd began dispersing
peacefully as darkness fell.
   A 15-member committee of Kosovo Serbs was formed to press for
the dismissal of ethnic Albanian leaders. It announced plans for
street protests and urged Slavic members of the Kosovo leadership
to resign as an example and protest.
   Milosevic told a crowd of workers in a Belgrade industrial
suburb only the Serbian party had the right to decide whether his
ally Ckrebic should resign from the national Politburo.
   Stipe Suvar, chief of the national party, said loss of a
conference vote by a Politburo member was unprecedented.
   Party leaders from other regions have been angered by
Milosevic's support of nationalist rallies by Serbs, and suspect
him of seeking greater power at their expense.
   Parliament's relaxation of the austerity program allows raises
of 140-152 percent for workers in profitable enterprises and in
social services like health and education.
   The changes were approved by the International Monetary Fund,
which demanded the austerity program as a condition for helping
Yugoslavia deal with its $21 billion foreign debt.

<TEXT>
   A huge icebreaking barge today began its
journey to rescue three trapped whales as scientists worried that
plunging temperatures and polar bears would threaten the mammals
they have named Bonnet, Crossbeak and Bone.
   Early today, a National Guard helicopter rigged to tow the
185-ton ``hover-barge'' resumed the 230-mile trip along the
desolate Arctic coast from Prudhoe Bay. It moved about five miles
Wednesday through sand bars, mud and shallow water.
   The 24- to 30-foot-long California gray whales, whose species is
endangered, became trapped in the ice two weeks ago while migrating
south.
   Eskimo whalers using chain saws in sub-zero temperatures have
been cutting holes in the thick Arctic Ocean ice to help the
mammals breathe. They got a boost Wednesday when two
brothers-in-law from Minnesota brought six $400 de-icers to the
$500,000 rescue effort.
   Greg Ferrian and Rick Skluzacek, of Lakeland, flew to Alaska at
their own expense to demonstrate the devices, invented by
Skluzacek's father, when rescue coordinators politely refused their
offer to help.
   Early today, under the skeptical supervision of the
coordinators, they quickly cleared ice and slush from the two
breathing holes, accomplishing in hours what had been taking the
rescue team, using chain saws, pickaxes and steel bars, a day to do.
   The cylindrical de-icer, about 9 inches around and 14 inches
long, floats in the water suspended beneath a styrofoam slab. A
small, double-blade propeller pulls warmer water up from below and
emits it with 34 pounds of thrust.
   Within 24 hours, the breathing holes should be about 30 feet by
70 feet _ three to four times the original size, Skluzacek said.
   The devices are used in marinas to keep boats from becoming
frozen in the winter, Ferrian said.
   The tired whales can survive for several more weeks despite
being battered and bleeding from grating against jagged ice, said
John Lien, professor of animal behavior at Memorial University in
Canada.
   ``They can bleed a barrel and still be fine,'' said Lien, who
has helped free whales from ice for 20 years. ``We're talking about
a big animal here, between five to 20 tons.''
   The whales also may have to contend with polar bears. Reporters
flying by helicopter Wednesday spotted five prowling the ice a few
miles from the whales.
   ``There are polar bears that are certainly going to be attracted
to this,'' said Ron Morris of the National Marine Fisheries
Service. ``If they're going to take the whales, we're not going to
stop them.''
   He said polar bears hunt at night, when biologists are usually
the only people near the breathing holes, 18 miles northeast of
this Eskimo village.
   The whales were named by biologists so the mammals' respiration
could be monitored when they surfaced. One was dubbed ``Bone''
because so much of its snout has been scraped away by the ice.
Eskimos have given them their own names: Siku (Ice), Putu (Icehole)
and Kanik (Snowflake).
   A National Weather Service ice analysis showed no open water in
the whales' vicinity. But a lead, or pathway, through the ice had
been spotted about five miles from the whales, said Jim Brooks,
acting director of the fisheries service in Alaska.
   ``There are open water leads throughout the Chukchi Sea and
Beaufort Sea, out for a long ways. The ice is always moving. It's
very dynamic,'' he said.
   Brooks said there was no guarantee the whales could reach open
water, about 200 miles southwest, even if they could get to the
leads.
   ``But the hope is that they will be able to make it through the
leads via these open leads used by bowheads and belugas in their
migration. But the gray whale is not an ice-adapted animal. It just
doesn't seem to be able to contend with the ice as well as other
species of whale,'' he said.
   Rescuers sought ways to coax the animals in the direction of
open water if icebreaking efforts were successful, including using
lights as a lure near two new breathing holes cut for them. But the
mammals have shown little interest.
   Greenpeace representative Cindy Lowry said tape recordings of
the sounds of other gray whales were being shipped to Barrow to try
to lure the animals to open water. If they don't respond to that,
biologists said, they have tapes of killer whales that might spur
the three young whales to escape.
   The barge was not expected to reach Barrow at least until midday
Friday, officials said.
   ``We're pretty optimistic,'' said Pete Leathard, president of
Veco Inc., the oil service company that owns the propulsionless air
cushion vehicle. ``It looks like it will be moving a little faster
now that it's cleared most of the mud and sandbars in the harbor.''
   Another National Guard Skycrane helicopter assigned to the
towing mission may be used instead to lift a huge reinforced
concrete cylinder to Barrow where it will be dropped to smash holes
through the ice. The slabs are leftover supports from construction
of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, fitted so they can be carried by
helicopters.
   ``That's going to Plan B,'' said Sheryl Deveau, a spokeswoman
for the guard. ``We have a 9,000- and a 14,000-pound concrete
reinforced slab. ... They'll start dropping that from the Barrow
end.''

   Republican vice presidential candidate
Dan Quayle courted blue-collar workers and students in a hotly
competitive state Thursday, declaring economic recovery during the
Reagan administration means ``a job for all who want to work.''
   Rejecting the Democrats' contention that many new jobs are
relatively low-paying, Quayle said, ``This economy is generating
millions of jobs in high-paying occupations. Taken together, wages
and fringe benefits have gone up 40 percent, about a third faster
than inflation.''
   In addition to his statements on traditional Republican themes,
he challenged businesses in a state where the Democrats have been
strong to offer day care and to include minorities in the economic
recovery.
   ``Smarter employers will understand they can't recruit good
people if they have employment practices that force them to choose
between being good workers and good parents,'' said Quayle.
``Employers who aren't so smart will fail, and deserve to.''
   A remaining economic challenge ``is the full integration of
blacks and Hispanics into the economy,'' he said. ``The last seven
yeras have built a foundation for doing exactly that.''
   On another subject, at a shopping mall rally, Quayle ridiculed
Dukakis' complaints that the Republicans have distorted his record
on crime issues.
   ``Let's give a few facts on crime, and I'll try not to add any
comments that further embarrass Mr. Dukkakis,'' Quayle said.
   He said Dukakis ``opposes the death penalty no matter how
horrible the crime'' and ``defended his furlough program throughout
his governorship.''
   ``He refused to change it until forced to do so by public
pressure in this election year,'' Quayle said.
   He recited other positions he said showed Dukakis was weak on
crime and led a crowd of more than 1,000 in chanting ``Good night,
Mike.''
   Earlier, before cheering college students, he touted the
administration's economic record.
   ``It means for the first time ever, we can make and keep the
promise of a job for every American who wants a job,'' said Quayle.
``It adds up to a job for all who want to work.''
   He said the Reagan administration has created 12 million new
jobs paying more than $20,000, including more than 5 million
averaging closer to $30,000 a year.
   Polls indicate the presidential race in Ohio is close, and
Quayle stumped through the eastern part of the state in an effort
to secure a Republican victory.
   The message, aides said, was aimed at blue-collar voters by
telling them the nation is far better off than when President
Reagan took office.
   Reagan campaigned in Ohio on Wednesday to emphasize the
importance Republicans are placing on the Midwestern industrial
state.
   Underscoring the economic message, Quayle was joined in his bus
caravan by Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin.
   His bus caravan wound through small industrial communities on
Thursday with stops in McConnelsville, Newark, Columbus and
Chillicothe. He planned on spending Friday in Georgia and Tennessee
before taking the weekend off the campaign trail.
   ``Don't want to get tired and mess up,'' said Quayle, explaining
his time off less than three weeks before the Nov. 8 election.
``Might possibly cost you to lose the election.''
   Quayle spoke with groups of schoolchildren briefly dismissed
from class, telling them to ``pay attention to your teachers. You
know what? You might grow up and run for vice president some day.''
   In his speeches, the message was sharper though he said he was
only raising issues Dukakis won't discuss.
   ``If I had their liberal ideas, I guess I wouldn't want to talk
about them either,'' said Quayle. ``Since they don't want to talk
it, we'll talk about it.
   ``You know and I know that their liberal approach to economics
will take us backward to higher inflation, high interest rates,
higher unemployment.''
   The bus caravan was a festive affair winding through the fall
colors, taking an occasional break for small-town parades in
antique automobiles.
   It started on a gloomy day in dense fog, conditions Quayle likes
to call ``Dukakis weather,'' but that weather soon gave way to
bright sunshine.

<BYLINE>Public Sector Strike Is Major Challenge For New Premier
^By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil servants across the country staged a one-day
strike for better pay Thursday, disrupting public services and
presenting Premier Michel Rocard with the toughest challenge of his
five months in office.
   There was no way to determine how many of the estimated 5
million civil servants participated.
   In Paris, subway and bus service was cut by one-half to
two-thirds. Many commuters feared the worst and drove into the
city, resulting in huge traffic jams. Some highways leading into
Paris were backed up as much as 17 miles.
   Air France canceled 31 flights and major rail lines were running
at one-half to two-thirds their usual number.
   Mail went undelivered and teachers didn't show up for classes in
many parts of the country, and many public offices were closed.
   ``The worst thing that could happen would be that the government
continue in its obstinacy,'' said Jean Kaspar, national secretary
of the Socialist-run French Democratic Confederation of Labor, at a
demonstration in central Paris.
   Andre Bergeron, head of the Worker Force union, said the
government must ``concede something and come to an agreement next
week or risk finding itself in an inextricable situation,'' perhaps
involving more and longer strikes.
   Public service employees received a 1 percent raise in March and
1 percent in September. They have been offered a 2.2 percent
increase for 1989.
   Inflation is expected to hit 2.8 percent in 1988, and the public
workers see themselves losing 0.8 percent in purchasing power.
   Maintaining purchasing power is not the only demand of the seven
different unions representing public workers, but it is far and
away the most important one.
   Rocard has been criticized by the conservative opposition and by
his own Socialist Party.
   Civil service workers in France traditionally vote left, and
they are especially disappointed by the lack of sympathy they
perceive on the part of the Socialists, who took over from the
conservatives after spring elections.
   The government received a shock in August when the monthly trade
deficit nearly tripled to $1.5 billion. With little prospect of the
trade deficit improving much, officials are afraid any relaxation
in austerity measures will increase inflation and lead to an even
wider trade deficit.
   Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the conservative Rally for the
Republic party, accused Rocard of failing to start consultations
with labor soon enough. He criticized the premier for trying to
deal with different types of employees on a case-by-case basis
instead of working out an overall solution.
   Pierre Mauroy, a former premier who is now head of the Socialist
Party, publicly castigated Rocard for his approach.
   In a radio interview Wednesday, Mauroy expressed his
``solidarity with the strikers'' and said, ``This situation cannot
continue. They cannot be the only ones to see their purchasing
power diminish.''
   The workers believe that the French economy has been improving
lately and that after years of austerity, they should now benefit.
The government has pleaded for more time, six months to a year.
   Police and firefighters are public sector employees but they
don't have the right to strike and did not participated in
Thursday's action. Nurses in public hospitals can strike but are
required to provide minimum service. Air traffic controllers also
are public employees but, like nurses, are required to provide
minimum service.

   The Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson says
severe financial strain from continued ownership of television
station KDTU has forced elimination of 14 jobs, suspension of some
services and imposition of salary cuts.
   ``The financial resources of the diocese have been severely
pressured by the continuing financial demands caused by the
diocesan-owned television station,'' Bishop Manuel D. Moreno said
in a letter to parishes.
   He said efforts have failed over the last three years to sell
the UHF station, Channel 18, which went on the air in 1984, and the
``continuing demands caused by its operations'' have forced
reductions in diocesan services to parishes.
   The bishop said the cutbacks, however, would not affect regular
parish operations nor parish employees since parish budgets are
administered independently. He also said Catholic Community
Services, Catholic schools and cemeteries would be unaffected.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A King's College political scientist
says that just as there no longer is a unified ``Catholic vote'' in
America, the ``Catholic lobby'' also is fragmented.
   The Rev. Thomas J. O'Hara, who has examined 31 separate
Washington-based Catholic interest groups advocating various public
policy positions, says many scholars mistakenly considered the
Catholic lobby ``a monolith.''
   ``That really is a distorted view,'' he says. O'Hara, who has
written a chapter on the multifaceted Catholic lobby in a new book,
``Religion in American Politics,'' says:
   ``There are Catholic pacifists, feminists, traditionalist and
advocates of positions on many policy issues. Some are to the left
of the bishops and some are to the right.''

<HEAD>Possible Spotted Owl Nest Endangers Mining Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLACIER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mining claims valued up to $400 million
may be endangered by a pair of nesting spotted owls, considered an
endangered species by the state.
   The rare owls are believed to inhabit the slopes above Wells
Creek Canyon, where a Spokane mining company hopes to dig for gold
and silver.
   But Audubon Society officials see possible problems if the
sighting of young owls means nests are nearby.
   ``It just doesn't seem feasible (for mining) not to impact the
owl,'' says Audubon staff member Chuck Sisco.
   ``The spotted owl is a major issue, and we are bringing in
biologists to study this,'' said Wallace McGregor, president of the
mining company, Steelhead Resources Ltd.
   McGregor and other company officials briefed government and
environmental representatives Tuesday at the site of the Great
Excelsior Mine, opened at the turn of the century 12 miles south of
the Canadian border.
   Glacier, a hamlet consisting mainly of a ranger station and a
tavern, was where the 1935 film ``Call of the Wild'' starring Clark
Gable and Loretta Young was filmed.
   Geologists have made a total of 61 test borings into the
volcanic rock in Steelhead's 1,250-acre claim and have identified
approximately 160,000 ounces of gold and 10 million ounces of
silver worth about $130 million at current prices.
   McGregor says extensions of the known ore zone, as well as a
potential for finding new deposits, could boost the value of
Steelhead's claims to $400 million.
   He estimates the mine would be worked for 10 to 20 years with 50
to 100 local people employed at any one time.
   To begin operations, however, the miners must obtain 36 federal
and state permits, undergo an environmental impact study and meet a
still-undetermined list of county requirements.
   McGregor estimated it would be two to four years before the
operation could begin.
   Spotted owls, including young offspring, have been reported in
the area since the late 1970s, indicating there may be a nest
someplace, such as the cavity of a rotting old tree, in the area
where the pit miners would dig, said Brady Green, a wildlife
biologist with the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
   ``What we are trying to do is work with them (the mining
company) the best we can until it is determined what they are going
to do (with the site) and then try and minimize the impact so we
don't further jeopardize it as spotted owl habitat,'' Green said.
   The forest service has designated the region as a spotted owl
habitat area, but Cindy Correll, a mining specialist with the Mount
Baker Ranger District, said an 1872 law gives miners the right to
``prospect, explore and develop valuable mineral deposits'' in
national forests.
   The spotted owl is not designated an endangered or threatened
species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, although it is on
the forest supervisor's list of ``sensitive'' wildlife.
   In Washington state, the spotted owl is considered endangered.
While the state lacks authority to protect the bird's habitat in
federal forests, Wildlife Department officials said the intentional
killing of a spotted owl could result in criminal prosecution.
   Tom Juelson, manager of non-game programs for the state Wildlife
Department, said the problem could be hard to resolve if a nest
were found.
   ``If it were an easy resolution, it would have been resolved,''
he says. ``Those who have the mining permit have a great deal at
stake. The spotted owl is an endangered species. These kinds of
conflicts don't lend themselves to an easy solution.''

<HEAD>Polish Government Seeks Swifter Improvement in Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday following a
visit by a U.S. deputy secretary of state that relations with the
United States are not improving fast enough.
   The Oct. 12-13 visit by Deputy Secretary of State John C.
Whitehead was ``a step forward in mutual relations, though it is
not yet what one could expect,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Stefan Staniszewski.
   It was Whitehead's second visit to Poland this year and his
third since a thaw in U.S.-Polish relations began in early 1987,
leading to a lifting of U.S. Economic sanctions imposed after the
1981 martial law crackdown on the Solidarity trade union.
   ``The United States, despite its earlier declarations
encouraging us to bold reforms, in fact continues to stick to its
wait-and-see attitude,'' Staniszewski said.
   Staniszewski said he was referring to a lack of steps to develop
economic relations, including aid from the United States to Poland,
U.S. backing of aid through international organizations, and
investment in Poland by private American companies.
   As far as specific possibilities of utilizing credits, Whitehead
could only mention loans allowing Poland to buy up to 8,000 tons of
surplus U.S. food, he said.
   If Poland were to use the credits to buy butter, the most
expensive item, then they would be worth $16 million, he said. ``We
can buy butter cheaper elsewhere,'' he added.
   Whitehead said at the conclusion of his visit that future aid to
Poland depended on favorable trends in political and economic
liberalization. He also said that the United States continues to
hope for relegalization of Solidarity.
   Poland has a foreign debt of nearly $40 billion, the highest in
the East bloc. It seeks Western credits to allow it to rebuild
aging factories and develop new sources of hard-currency earnings.

   Religious leaders from several denominations
urged presidential candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis on
Thursday to stop talking about what weapons they would support and
lay out plans for a more peaceful world.
   ``There is yet time in this campaign to move beyond the sterile
and spiritless argument over Midgetman versus MX missiles, over
conventional buildup versus Star Wars,'' Roman Catholic Bishop
Thomas J. Gumbleton of Detroit told reporters.
   The bishop, joined by top Protestant and Jewish ministers,
called for Bush and Dukakis to spell out how they would ensure
world peace, protect global security without nuclear weapons and
strengthen the role of the United Nations.
   Earlier this month, 100 members of a new organization, ``Choose
Peace, Religious Leaders in Defense of Creation,'' signed letters
mailed to both candidates urging each to ``define your
comprehenvise, long-term plan for peace, with the specific steps
you would take during your administration to move toward its
fulfillment.''
   Members said their organization is non-partisan.

   In this tank you'll see pygmy sharks. In

gap-toothed talk show host. Yikes! Is that really David Letterman
underwater?
   The late-night comedian is considering taping a segment of his
television show at the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, but the tourist
attraction isn't sure it can accommodate Letterman's request.
   ``My impression is they want to film a show underwater,'' said
aquarium spokesman George Donnelly. ``We would love to try to do
something about it. But we don't know if we can work out the
logistics of it.''
   Donnelly said representatives for the show called the non-profit
aquarium three weeks ago to ask about filming among the fishtanks.
   ``To be honest with you, I thought it was a crank call,'' said
Donnelly, who said he occasionally watches ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' on NBC.
   Donnelly said two writers inspected the aquarium with the
intention of filming in November or December, but that he hasn't
heard anything else. He said other aquariums also were being looked

   Saying, ``I don't support cop killers,''
singer Willie Nelson expressed disappointment in a decision by
Austin police not to provide security for a benefit concert next
month.
   Helping Our Brother Out, or HOBO, an organization planning the
Nov. 11 concert in Austin, lined up Ranger security after the
Austin Police Association voted two weeks ago not to provide it,
said HOBO spokeswoman Marion Morris.
   Police officers protested Nelson's participation in a concert
last year to raise defense money for American Indian activist
Leonard Peltier, serving two life sentences for the 1975 murder of
two FBI agents.
   Nelson said in a phone interview he performed at the Peltier
benefit ``not to get this man out of prison but to get money for
lawyers'' who could bring to light withheld information about the
case.
   ``I don't support cop killers. I don't support Indian killers. I
don't support any kind of killers. I just believe this particular
issue of Leonard Peltier, there's more than meets the eye,'' Nelson
said.
   HOBO on Wednesday received a donation of $10,000 from Provident
Development Co. of Austin for concert expenses. HOBO is a
non-profit organization supported by churches and businesses that
works to improve the plight of Austin's homeless.

   The first man to break the sound barrier,
retired Air Force Gen. Chuck Yeager, says he was duped into
promoting a theme park for military veterans that was to be built
in western South Dakota.
   Dressed in cowboy boots, jeans and a windbreaker, Yeager
testified Wednesday in U.S. District Court at the trial of four men
accused of bilking investors and creditors out of more than
$800,000.
   Yeager, 65, who flew faster than the speed of sound in 1947 and
who continues to work as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in
California, said after testifying, ``When some guy uses you, it
ticks you off.''
   Yeager said he was asked in 1986 by defendant Michael Crosby to
film a commercial promoting the veterans park. The money for the
park was to have been raised through the sale of commemorative
medallions and contributions.
   Officials at Can-Am Mint and Trading Ltd. said they would sell 1
million commemorative coins that were guaranteed to appreciate in
value, but they sold about 5,900 coins for between $80 and $99 to
412 investors. The investors claim they never received the coins.

   A candidate's attempt to raise money
and publicity in a state Senate race by having retired Lt. Col
Oliver L. North speak at a dinner may wind up costing the candidate
$4,000.
   Republican Joseph F. Roberts had hoped North's speech here
Thursday night would help him in his fight to unseat Democratic
state Sen. John B. Larson.
   ``It's going to be the most expensive plate dinner I've ever
gone to,'' said Roberts, owner of Roberts Farm and Country Store.
   North's speaking fee is $25,000 and Roberts also had to pay for
the banquet hall and other expenses. He said he had expected as
many as 300 people to buy tickets at $175 apiece. But only 140
tickets had been sold by late Wednesday.
   Although Roberts guessed it would cost him $4,000 from his
pocket, he said doesn't regret the idea because it helps identify
him and supports North's legal fight.
   North and three others are charged with conspiracy to divert
proceeds of U.S. arms sales to Iran for aid for the Nicaraguan
Contras at a time when Congress banned U.S. military aid to the

<TEXT>
   A senior official of the ruling party
on Thursday denied that party members were removed because they
opposed President Najib's drive for a peaceful settlement with
U.S.-backed rebels.
   Government radio, meanwhile, said seven people, including an
American, were killed when their car hit a mine in southeastern
Afghanistan.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan, said the car was
loaded with weapons for the guerrillas. It said the seven,
including the American, four Pakistanis and two Egyptians, were
killed in Zabul province but did not say when and gave no names.
   On Sunday, the radio said two U.S. advisers to the rebels were
killed during a government attack on rebel positions near Gardez,
60 miles southeast of Kabul. Western diplomats have said no
American citizens are in Afghanistan on official business.
   The party official, Mohammad Wali, said that since Soviet troops
began leaving Afghanistan on May 15, 20,000 ``terrorists'' have
entered Afghanistan from Pakistan and 450 cars containing weapons
have been found.
   Wali spoke to Western and Soviet-bloc reporters at a briefing on
Wednesday's meeting of the Central Committee of the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   He said Najib accused the United States of taking advantage of
the Soviet withdrawal to intensify shipments of arms to the rebels.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979, and
about 100,000 have helped the Marxist government fight the rebels.
Under a U.N. agreement signed in April, all the troops are to be
out by Feb. 15.
   Two party Politburo members were dismissed Wednesday, but Wali
denied it was because they disagreed with Najib.
   ``The health of the two was not so good,'' said Wali, chief of
the Central Committee's organization department.
   One of the pair, Zalour Razinjo, is in his early 30s and is not
known to have any ailments.
   The other, Saleh Mohammad Zarry, is believed to be in his 60s.
The chief known threat to his health was an assassination attempt
last spring, a foreign diplomatic source said on condition of
anonymity.
   This source and other observers said Zarry and Razinjo opposed
the Red Army withdrawal.
   Wali said the pair did not disagree with ``national
reconciliation,'' the government's term for a negotiated settlement
and the focus of Wednesday's meeting.
   About 15 hours before the meeting started, state-run television
said some party members were arrested but did not say how many. An
offical source said they were seized because they opposed national
reconciliation. Wali said he did not know how many were arrested.
   Various foreign observers said between 17 and 350 were arrested,
including three members of the Central Committee. Afghan observers
said the total was in the dozens.
   Wali said the Central Committee has 97 members, far below the
140 reported by well-placed Afghan and foreign observers. He did
not report any recent dismissals and he declined to say how many
attended Wednesday's session.
   Wali said Najib told participants the party has given up ``the
monopoly of power, and the party is ready to take further peaceful
steps.''
   Najib is the leader of both the government and the party, but he
has tried to portray them as separate entities.
   Last spring, he made a show of broadening the base of his
government by appointing a non-party member, Mohammad Hasan Sharq,
prime minister. The 32-man Cabinet headed by Sharq, a pragmatic
political survivor with good ties to Moscow, has at least 14
non-party members.
   But Politburo members retain five key ministerial posts:
defense, state security, interior, foreign affairs and
communications. The Politburo had 13 members until Wednesday's two
dismissals.
   Asked whether the Central Commitee planned to take more party
members out of the Cabinet in the interest of national
reconciliation, Wali said the party is ready to compromise, but he
declined to say how and to what extent.
   Wali said Najib also stressed the need for talks with guerrilla
commanders on an individual basis. The Pakistan-based rebel leaders
have refused to deal with Najib and the party.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _ The official Soviet news agency Tass said two members of the
anti-government Islamic Society of Afghanistan were sentenced in
Kabul to death and two others sentenced to prison for a car bombing
that killed 14 people and injured 30. It said the Sept. 11 bombing
was masterminded in Pakistan.
   _ Tass said 10 rockets were fired at the capital Wednesday and
that one hit a house, killing two children and wounding their
parents. On Wednesday, about 60 rockets were fired, killing nine
people and wounding 25, Tass said.

   An electrical fire broke out in the
control tower at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport today,
temporarily suspending operations and diverting flights to other
airports for about an hour.
   The fire, which broke out during the noontime rush, one of the
busiest times of day for air travel, forced evacuation of the tower
at the world's fourth-busiest airport.
   The fire at the base of the Federal Aviation Administration
tower was extinguished within minutes, said Angel Biasatti, a
public information officer at the airport.
   A technician who was working on the electrical panel when it
burst into flame was injured, said Henry Christensen, an FAA staff
member. Christensen was unable to say why the technician was
working on the panel.
   The employee was in stable condition after being treated for
minor burns, said Jane McKinney, assistant head nurse at Harris
Methodist HEB Hospital.
   Planes resumed limited takeoffs and landings about 12:30 p.m.,
and the regional FAA office took over air traffic control, airport
spokesmen said. But officials said it would be at least 4 p.m.
before flight operations returned to normal.
   Air traffic at Dallas' Love Field and a naval air station nearby
also was interrupted so flights diverted from DFW could land,
officials said.
   Al Becker of American Airlines said flights were being diverted
to airports as far as 400 miles away, including those at Abilene,
Lubbock and Amarillo in Texas and at Tulsa, Okla.
   DFW is the headquarters for American Airlines' fleet and a major
national hub for several other airlines, including Delta and
Braniff.

   A black man who fought for almost 30
years for the right to practice law in Florida was posthumously
reinstated to The Florida Bar on Thursday by a unanimous state
Supreme Court.
   In its decision to reinstate Virgil Darnell Hawkins, the court
said, ``Hawkins' struggle for equal justice under the law should be
memorialized.''
   Hawkins, who died Feb. 11, resigned from the bar more than three
years ago.
   His struggle began in 1949 when, at the age of 41, he was denied
admission to the University of Florida School of Law because of his
race. Seven years later, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered that
Hawkins was entitled to prompt admission to the university.
   However, the Florida Supreme Court refused to admit Hawkins to
the university because of the potential for ``great public
mischief'' resulting from admitting blacks to white state schools.
   The ``public mischief'' referred to in the opinion consisted of
threats by white parents to have their children leave or transfer
schools if blacks were admitted.
   Hawkins finally attended law school in Boston, but was later
denied permission to take the Florida Bar exam because the school
was unaccredited.
   In 1976, the Florida Supreme Court, in an attempt to remedy
injustices of the past, ordered that Hawkins be admitted to the Bar
without having to take the exam.
   The next year, at the age of 69, Hawkins opened his law office
in Leesburg, ``seldom turning away an indigent client in need,''
the court noted.
   However, Hawkins ultimately faced disciplinary proceedings as a
result, the court said, of a practice that reflected his age, the
strain of practicing alone and the lapse of years since law school.
   He pleaded no contest to misappropriating $15,000 in clients'
funds and filed a petition to resign from the bar that was accepted
on April 18, 1985.
   ``When I get to heaven, I want to be a member of the Florida
Bar,'' Hawkins told the court. He died Feb. 11.
   Many attorneys from throughout the state joined a petition filed
by Harley Scott Herman of Leesburg to reinstate Hawkins
posthumously.
   Rutledge Liles, president of The Florida Bar, applauded the
court's decision to do so, noting Hawkins' ``unique contributions
to opening the practice of law in Florida to persons of all races.''
   ``To his undying memory, it is a tribute to the man that he
fought successfully and unselfishly to correct such a wrong,'' he
said.

   A government official said Thursday that
investigators are not ruling out sabotage as the cause of two
domestic airline crashes that killed 165 people.
   Another commercial airplane, an Indian Airlines Airbus carrying
209 people, made an emergency landing after takeoff Thursday from
the southern city of Madras, airline officials said. They said the
plane apparently developed technical problems.
   Rescue workers gave up hope of finding survivors from the crash
of a Fokker Friendship airplane that slammed into a hill Wednesday
in the eastern state of Assam.
   Federal Aviation Minister Shiv Raj Patil made a three-hour trek
to the crash site.
   ``Bodies were strewn all around,'' he told reporters after
returning to Guwahati. ``There can be no survivors.'' The plane
carried 31 passengers and four crew members.
   Vayudoot, the domestic carrier that operated the plane,
suspended service in the region for at least five days because of
an aircraft shortage, United News of India reported.
   It normally operates four planes in the area, but another plane
was damaged recently when it hit an Indian Airlines truck at
Calcutta airport, UNI said.
   In the western city of Ahmadabad, investigators were examining
the wreckage of an Indian Airlines Boeing 737 that crashed
Wednesday while trying to land in thick fog. All but five of the
135 people on board died.
   Forensic experts collected samples of blood-stained debris,
grass and soil to check for residue from explosives.
   ``Two crashes on the same day in a few hours is too much of a
coincidence,'' said one government official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The two planes crashed within two hours of each other.
   Villagers in the area said they heard an explosion shortly
before the Fokker crashed, but Vayudoot officials blamed the
accident on the rainy weather. The pilot reported zero visibility
minutes before losing radio contact, said
   J.C. Barua, a Vayudoot spokesman, said the pilot's last message
to the control tower at Guwahati airport was, ``I can't see
anything.''
   The government has set up courts of inquiry to investigate both
crashes and announced compensation of about $14,000 each to
families of victims.
   Both airlines have come under fire recently for poor management
and failing to meet safety standards. The charges were repeated in
Thursday's newspapers.
   The Indian Post in Bombay said aviation experts had warned of a
major air disaster ``in view of the highly questionable manner in
which civil aviation, particularly Indian Airlines and Vayudoot,
has been managed.''
   ``Demoralization, indiscipline and slippages in technical
maintenance, compunded by overflogging planes and pilots have ...
Dangerously affected the performance of the airline,'' the
newspaper said.
   Indian Airlines flies to 73 airports in India and operates some
flights to neighboring countries. Vayudoot flies mainly to smaller
domestic centers not covered by Indian Airlines. Both carriers are
owned by the government.
   A third state-owned airline, Air-India, flies only international
routes.

<HEAD>Close California Senate Race Features Two Similar Politicians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pete Wilson and Leo McCarthy bristle
at suggestions that they're politicians cut from the same cloth.
   Similar in experience, temperament and speaking style, Wilson,
who is seeking his second term as California's junior senator, and
McCarthy, his Democratic challenger, are both cautious career
politicians who are more inclined to pragmatic compromises than to
extreme ideological posturing.
   Little wonder it has taken this long for the contest to catch
fire.
   Wilson has led in every poll, but the margins have steadily
slipped from a high of 22 percent in early 1987 to a low of 3
points last week. The race appears tight in the closing weeks.
   The candidates are each spending millions in California's
super-heated television wars. One Wilson ad shows the closed gates
in front of a posh San Diego condominium complex where McCarthy
owns two units and wonders ``Where does all of McCarthy's money
come from?''
   A McCarthy ad has drawn howls of protest from Wilson's campaign.
It features Republican Senate Leader Bob Dole talking about a 1985
budget vote that was so close an ill and sedated Wilson was wheeled
in from the hospital. ``I said vote yes. He voted yes. We rolled
him out again. He does better under sedation,'' Dole says.
   Wilson, 55, and McCarthy, 58, are both attorneys who have spent
most of their adult lives in public office. Wilson was elected to
the state Assembly at age 33, and McCarthy to the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors, also at age 33.
   They served together in the Assembly for three years, 1968
through 1971, when Wilson was elected mayor of San Diego. McCarthy
went on to become Speaker of the Assembly, a post he held from 1974
to 1980, while Wilson served 11 years as mayor. Wilson was elected
to the Senate in 1982 in the same election that McCarthy won his
first of two terms as lieutenant governor.
   Even though their careers took parallel paths, their differences
are clear on the issues.
   Wilson is a fiscal conservative who believes the key is less
government interference, while McCarthy is a liberal who doesn't
hesitate to use the authority of the government to achieve his
goals.
   ``We shouldn't spend money in Congress to create jobs,'' says
Wilson. ``What we should spend it for is to keep America strong in
order to keep America free.''
   McCarthy takes exactly the opposite approach, criticizing
Wilson's record of unwavering support of the economic policies of
President Reagan and Vice President George Bush.
   The contrast is even sharper on defense and foreign policy
issues.
   ``We ought to take $1 billion from Star Wars and put it in the
classroom so our kids can get a decent education,'' McCarthy says.
   Wilson has supported aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, backs
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative defense system and champions
California's defense industry.
   McCarthy has been an outspoken critic of Reagan's policies
throughout Central America, and especially in Nicaragua, and is
skeptical of the levels of spending throughout the defense
department.
   They both shun the anti-abortion and prayer-in-school political
agenda of the far right, and like McCarthy, Wilson is an advocate
of child care and major reforms in health care for the elderly.
   Wilson also has a much stronger environmentalist record than
most Republicans, including a strong stance against oil drilling
off the California coast.
   But while Wilson's moderate record on environmental and social
issues has blurred the differences for the average voter, McCarthy
has the support of the majority of activists for those issues.

<TEXT>
   A couple have been ordered to stand
trial for murder for allegedly killing their baby daughter with a
cocaine overdose.
   A Superior Court judge Tuesday overturned a lower-court decision
and ordered Gilbert and Debbie Delgado to stand trial for the 1986
death of 2-month-old Stephanie Delgado. A municipal judge ruled
there was not enough evidence to charge the couple with murder.
   The child's death, at first linked to sudden infant death
syndrome, was later blamed on cocaine when tests found small
amounts in the child's system, authorities said.
   ``We believe that the Delgados, by selling and using large
amounts of cocaine in a very tiny apartment and in very close
proximity to a 2-month-old child, were creating an inherently
dangerous environment,'' Deputy District Attorney Richard King
said. ``It was just a matter of time before this child died of
cocaine.''
   Superior Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer set a Jan. 23 trial date.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Order Car Owners to Testify in Hit-And-Run Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors thwarted by a judge's
ruling that they cannot force a lawyer to reveal the name of a
client involved in a hit-and-run fatality ordered depositions
Thursday from people with cars similar to the man's.
   Several of the car owners complained that their vehicles have
already been checked and cleared by police.
   The accident victim, Mark Baltes, died March 9, 1986, after what
is believed to be a white 1984 or 1985 Buick Riviera ran over him
in a street where he lay after a night of drinking.
   A person who claimed to be driving the car contacted attorney
Barry Krischer and demanded the lawyer not reveal his identity to
police while negotiating with authorities. Prosecutors sought to
force Krischer to give them the name, but last week a judge ruled
that attorney-client privilege protects the suspect's identity.
   So prosecutors tried a different tack this week.
   Nine people were ordered to give sworn statements in Palm Beach
County State Attorney David Bludworth's office on Thursday. Seven
of them own or drive 1984 or 1985 white Buick Rivieras, the Palm
Beach Post reported. Of the remaining two, one is the husband of a
woman subpoenaed. The paper said the ninth person subpoenaed did
not have a white Buick Riviera registered in Palm Beach County.
   Assistant State Attorney Kenneth Selvig would not say why these
drivers were selected from the owners of 2,800 Buick Rivieras
registered in Palm Beach and Broward counties.
   ``All I can say is we're continuing to pursue the
investigation,'' he said.
   Most of those subpoenaed said police have already examined their
cars and determined they were not involved in the accident.
   Stockbroker Jeffrey Randall said two detectives searched his
white Buick Riviera six weeks ago and questioned him about it.
   ``I can understand the persistence,'' said Randall, of Boca
Raton. ``But all of a sudden somebody turned up the heat real high,
and it's starting to irritate me. I don't know if it's the
political thing or what.''
   Selvig denied any connections between the subpoenas and
Bludworth's Nov. 8 re-election bid. ``This has nothing to do with
the election,'' he said.
   Palm Beach hairdresser Michael Vulpio said detectives also
looked at his vehicle. He said the front end of his car was
repaired after an accident but that he knew nothing about the
Baltes hit-and-run.
   Pamela Cherry, a West Palm Beach real estate agent, was
interviewed by police last year. Court records show officers
determined that ``Cherry's vehicle was in no way involved in this
case.''
   Mary Sussil's 1984 Riviera was searched twice by police. Mrs.
Sussil, a legal secretary, gave a statement and allowed police to
search her car when police said it seemed to have a new grill and
fresh paint.
   On May 12, police eliminated her car because they found the
grill was the car's original.
   ``I'm kind of mystified about the whole thing,'' said Mrs.
Sussil's attorney, David Kelley. ``We've cooperated fully. ... Her
car was not involved.''

   A woman who became an undercover agent for
six weeks to try to free her grown daughters from the grip of drug
dependence also helped break up a major methamphetamine operation,
authorities say.
   The 44-year-old bartender, who asked to be identified only as
Pat, aided in the arrests of two of the five men taken into custody
Wednesday, said Police Chief Jim Harper of nearby Dallas.
   Several additional suspects were being sought, Harper said
Thursday.
   Pat, a grandmother of two, said she decided to get involved
because her daughters, ages 24 and 21, use methamphetamine and had
been virtually living out of their cars.
   ``The people were getting all their money for drugs,'' Pat said.
   The woman, who often wore a hidden microphone during her
undercover work, was accompanied by police early Wednesday to a
state park west of Salem, where she had arranged to sell chemicals
to a suspect.
   Harper said 45 officers from six agencies later served search
warrants at three Polk County residences. Two men were arrested at
the park and three others were arrested at a farm in Dallas, a town
of 8,900 about 15 miles west of Salem.
   Officers also seized an ounce of methamphetamine and several
gallons of chemicals used to manufacture the drug, Harper said.
   ``This lady really came through,'' the chief said. ``Talk about
being involved and making that sacrifice, she really did.''
   Pat said she had accompanied her daughters to a farm where they
allegedly purchased drugs, then gave the address to Dallas police.
The department was aware of the farm but didn't have enough
evidence at the time, she said.
   ``I led the people (at the farm) to believe I needed money and I
needed it bad and told them I knew some people where I could get
some chemicals,'' she said. ``They really took the bait.''
   She became well-acquainted with the people and most of the time
wasn't too worried about the environment, she said. But once she
became afraid when she was carrying a hidden microphone and one of
the suspects said, ``I want the wire (listening device) you're
wearing.''
   ``I didn't realize he was kidding,'' she said. ``You can't tell
when he's kidding. I was scared to death.''
   She eventually supplied some chemicals given to her by the
Dallas police.
   Pat said she's heard talk of marijuana and cocaine in her jobs
but knew little about methamphetamine.
   ``I just can't believe the chemicals that go into it,'' she
said. ``I just can't believe the chemicals people put into their
bodies. One of them is used to develop pictures. That tells you
something.''
   Her experience convinced her methamphetamine use is rampant.
   ``It's like an epidemic. They can't make this stuff fast
enough,'' she said. ``A pound sells for $16,000.''
   She said her daughters knew nothing of her undercover work
before the arrests. But now that her actions have been disclosed,
she said, her oldest daughter is angry at her but her youngest
daughter isn't.
   Now that her cover is blown, she says she's a bit worried about
her safety.
   ``But it's not going to stop me'' if there's more she can do,
she said.

<HEAD>Woman with Heart Transplant Gives Birth to Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 41-year-old woman who had a heart
transplant two years ago said Thursday she was elated at the birth
of her first child, a 3{-pound boy who ``knows my voice already.''
   ``He doesn't like to be messed around with a whole lot,'' said
the child's father, Gary V. Snell Sr., who joined his wife,
Bernita, and week-old son, Gary Jr., in a press conference at the
Medical College of Virginia Hospitals. ``He's a little fighter.''
   The boy, delivered eight weeks prematurely on Oct. 14, is only
the third child known to be born to a heart transplant recipient.
The other two births were in Europe and California.
   ``During the early stages of my pregnancy, I thought it was
cardiac rejection,'' said Mrs. Snell, who received her new heart
Aug. 17, 1986, at the hospital center.
   Yet despite the risks posed by the strain of carrying a child
and having to take anti-rejection drugs from the transplant, she
decided against initial counseling to terminate the pregnancy.
   Dr. James A. Thompson, a cardiologist, said Mrs. Snell's heart
therapy was not altered during her pregnancy, and she came through
the most critical first three months without problems.
   Dr. Patricia Hays, Mrs. Snell's obstetrician, said the special
circumstances of the case made an induced early delivery a
consideration until Mrs. Snell had a premature rupture of the
membrane.
   The infant's condition is not unusual for a premature baby, and
Gary Jr. is expected to be home with his parents by Thanksgiving,
the doctors said.
   ``So far, everything looks perfectly normal,'' said Dr. Gary
Gutcher, chairman of the medical center's division of neonatology.
   Mrs. Snell, who was released from the hospital Tuesday, said she
makes the 75- to 80-mile drive every day from her home in Hampton
to the hospital with her 38-year-old truck driver husband to see
their son.
   ``I'm so glad I did it,'' she said. ``I'm thankful to God for
him.''

   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, jokingly
put on the spot Thursday, borrowed Republican vice presidential
candidate Dan Quayle's answer to a question about suddenly becoming
president.
   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith, presiding at the
Economic Club luncheon, read a submitted question noting that
Burnley is 14th in line of succession to the presidency.
   ``If you should suddenly find yourself in the Oval Office, what
would you do?'' Smith asked Burnley. A similar question was put to
Quayle during his debate with Democrat Lloyd Bentsen two weeks ago.
   Several hundred business and civic leaders roared with laughter
as Burnley replied: ``Let me plagiarize from Senator Quayle.
Particularly asking me the question, the first thing I'd do is
pray. And the rest of you better pray, too.''

   Towing a 185-ton barge 230 miles
across Arctic ice with a huge Skycrane helicopter to try to save
three ice-bound whales is not the sort of job for which you can
practice.
   ``None of us has ever towed anything like this before. Period,''
Chief Warrant Officer Tom Williams said Thursday. ``But we're
confident in flying the helicopter.''
   ``We're kind of learning as we go,'' he said. ``We learned a lot
yesterday. We were a little apprehensive, but we're more relaxed
now.''
   Williams is co-pilot of the primary Alaska Army National Guard
Skycrane helicopter dragging an ice-breaking barge to Point Barrow
in an effort to break open a channel for three whales trapped at a
small breathing hole surrounded by miles of ice. A second Skycrane
also is available.
   The Skycrane, dubbed Isabel by its three-man crew, was designed
for lifting heavy loads, not acting like a tractor. But it tugged
and pulled the barge for four hours across five miles of muck,
shallow water and sand bars Wednesday before darkness stopped the
operation.
   ``We sure got hopeful. We were able to move it pretty well there
for awhile, then it bogged down again,'' Williams said. ``We're
trying to get out of that area to deeper water, basically, where we
think we can travel. When we hit pockets of deeper water we can
travel pretty well.
   ``Once we get into open water, the fellow operating the barge
says we'll be able to make five, up to 20 knots.''
   The $3 million barge was donated by VECO Inc., an oil field
construction and service company. It is 80 feet long, 61 feet wide
and 26 feet tall and rides on an air cushion generated by
diesel-driven fans, like a Hovercraft, allowing it to be towed over
water, ice or solid ground.
   It can carry 100 tons and has a deck large enough to carry at
least three tractor-trailer rigs.
   The helicopter can lift about 25,000 pounds, not enough to lift
the barge but enough to tow it on its air cushion.
   Skycranes are the second-largest helicopters in the U.S.
military inventory. They are second only to HH-53 troop carriers
used by the U.S. Marine Corps, Guard officials said.
   There are probably 60 of the Vietnam-era Skycranes left in
National Guard units across the nation, with four in Alaska, the
aircrew said.
   Williams' aircraft, piloted by Chief Warrant Officer Gary
Quarles, is 18 years old. Its 45-foot rotor blades are powered by
twin engines generating 9,600 horsepower.
   The aircraft's cargo hook is attached to the bow of the barge by
about 700 feet of nylon and steel cable.
   From an altitude of as low as 25 feet, the helicopter pulls the
craft in a steeply nose-down attitude.
   ``We're kind of staring at the ice and hanging in our shoulder
harness,'' Williams said. ``We have to lock our shoulder harnesses.
It's real tiring from our viewpoint.
   ``While one pilot is flying, the other pilot is constantly
calling out power, nose-down attitude and reading the instruments.''
   The Skycrane must refuel about every two hours, Williams said,
and can't tow at night.

<TEXT>
   The House joined the Senate on Thursday in
threatening a renewal of military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels
unless the Sandinista government observes the Central America peace
accords.
   The action came as the House, by voice vote, sent to President
Reagan a bill which designates 1.43 million acres of Forest Service
land in Montana as wilderness.
   The measure contains several unrelated, non-binding resolutions,
attached by the Senate, on foreign policy issues. In addition to
the warning about Contra aid, they formally embrace Chile's move
toward democracy and urge American allies to resist Soviet efforts
to acquire millions of U.S. dollars through third countries.
   The Contra amendment supports unspecified ``continuing efforts
to strengthen the internal democratic opposition and the
independent media of Nicaragua.''
   It also calls for ``maintaining the Nicaraguan freedom fighters
as one of the few `pressure points' on the Sandinistas by providing
the resistance urgently needed humanitarian assistance.''
   White House officials and GOP lawmakers have said prospects are
nil for obtaining a $16.5 million cache of weapons for the rebels
in the waning days of the 100th Congress.
   The dwindling Contra forces are subsisting on $27 million in
food, clothing and medical supplies approved by Congress last
month. They have received no weaponry from the United States since
lethal aid was halted in February.
   Though Congress has been strongly opposed to new military aid,
the bill says a Sandinista failure to comply with Central American
peace accords ``will inevitably cause the Congress to approve
additional military assistance for the Nicaraguan resistance.''
   The wilderness bill affects more than 6 million acres of Montana
and is the result of a compromise worked out among competing
interests, including conservationists and the timber and lumber
industries.
   The bill designates about 1.43 million acres of Forest Service
land as wilderness, 360,000 acres as special management areas, and
another 20,000 acres as federal study areas. It also releases for
non-wilderness uses more than 10 million acres in Montana's 10
national forests.

<HEAD>Party Chief Replaced in Lithuania After Less Than One Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief of Lithuania was
replaced Thursday, Tass reported, less than a year after he took
office and on the eve of a Lithuanian nationalist group's
conference.
   Ringaudas Songaila, a 58-year-old agricultural expert, retired
and Lithuanian party leaders chose Algirdas Brazauskas to replace
him, the official news agency said.
   Lithuania became the second Baltic republic to get a new leader
just before the convening of a local nationalist group. The changes
appear to signal the Kremlin's intention to put more reform-minded
officials in charge of the region.
   Brazauskas, 56, an engineer, is known in Lithuania as a
``strategist of the new,'' Tass said. It said Brazauskas ``has
proved to be a sincere advocate of change.''
   Songaila became the party head in December. Within a few months,
he had to deal with a burgeoning nationalist movement in the
republic of 3.6 million people.
   Nationalists on June 3 founded the Lithuanian Restructuring
Movement, and the group is to hold a conference Saturday and Sunday
in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.
   Activist Vytautas Bogusis, invited to the conference as a guest
of honor, said in a telephone interview Thursday that Songaila
never achieved much popularity. He stayed largely out of the public
eye and did not address rallies of the Restructuring Movement.
   Party chiefs in the Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia have
spoken to nationalist groups there.
   ``He (Songaila) sits in the catacombs and has a Stalinist
conservative position. There has been no perestroika from him,''
said Bogusis, referring to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic and
political reform program.
   Bogusis, a member of a more radical group called the Lithuanian
Freedom League, said Songaila's reputation worsened after police
beat and kicked two dozen people and arrested at least 100 others
in nationalist protests last month.
   Bogusis said many Lithuanians blamed Songaila for the brutal
treatment of the demonstrators, who were protesting Soviet control
over the republic.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were independent countries from
shortly after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution until the Soviet Union
absorbed them in 1940 under a pact signed with Nazi Germany.
   On Oct. 4, the Latvian Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee named the republic's president, Jan Vagris, as its first
secretary. He succeeded Boris Pugo, who was transferred to a job in
Moscow.
   The Latvian People's Front met Oct. 8-9, and adopted a program
endorsing radical nationalist demands for the republic to have more
autonomy in its economic, political and cultural affairs.
   Gorbachev's reformist Kremlin is allowing the Baltic republics a
measure of independence.
   At the urging of the nationalist groups, all three republics'
governments have adopted or are considering laws to legalize
display of the flags that flew when the areas were independent; to
make the dominant nationalities' languages official; and to free
local culture, businesses and industry from the control of central
ministries in Moscow.

   The State Department on Thursday responded to
the latest outbreak of violence on Lebanon's border with an appeal
for security and stability _ and without directly calling on Israel
to forego revenge for the slaying of seven of its soldiers.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Lebanese militia, claimed
responsibility for the suicide bombing that caused the deaths. The
pro-Iranian group has been identified by counterterrorism experts
at the State Department as holding all nine American and six other
foreign hostages.
   Israeli leaders promised retaliation against the group. ``We
have to strike at these people of blood and terror everywhere and
at every opportunity,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in
Jerusalem.
   The soldiers were on the Lebanese side of the border, within a
security zone Israel maintains in order to prevent infiltration and
attacks.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said ``the
United States regrets the tragic loss of life and injuries
sustained in south Lebanon yesterday. We deplore this bloody attack
and the continuing violence in Lebanon that has resulted in the
death and injury of so many people, Israeli and Lebanese alike.''
   Asked if he had any warning for Israel about revenge, the U.S.
official said: ``I don't have any reaction to that threat.''
   Redman said the slaying of the seven Israeli soldiers was ``part
of a continuing occurrence, unfortunately, that we have seen in
Lebanon. And it's exactly the kind of thing that we've been trying
to come to grips with by doing something in that country _ by
helping to do something in that country that can bring more
stability and security for everyone.''
   Asked if the State Department had urged restraint on Israel, the
spokesman said: ``I'm going to leave my reaction where it is. I'm
not going to try to deal with every possible aspect of this
question. It's a continuing problem in the area. We've been through
what we have referred to many times as a cycle of violence.''
   Pressed by reporters again, Redman said ``the whole thrust of
our effort throughout is to bring security and stability, and that
is another way of saying `restraint.' That is a continuing aspect
of what we have tried to do in the region.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other U.S. diplomats
have tried to promote Arab-Israeli peace talks as well as a
settlement of Lebanon's civil disorders. Neither problem has been

   Harold V. Hunter, head of the Rural
Electrification Administration for seven years, has resigned and
plans to return to farming in Oklahoma, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng announced Thursday.
   Hunter's resignation will be effective on Oct. 28. He was
appointed to the REA job by President Reagan in 1981. The agency
provides financing for rural electric and telephone systems, and
currently has a loan portfolio of $60 billion.
   The agency job will be taken over by Deputy administrator Jack
Van Mark. Hunter plans to return to Enid, Okla., to join the
family's farming operation, which includes 1,780 acres specializing
in alfalfa, wheat and beef cattle.

<HEAD>Farm Income May Still Match Or Exceed Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite drought, the net cash income of
farmers in 1988 is expected to nearly match or exceed last year's
record $57.1 billion, unchanged from the outlook a month ago, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said higher commodity
prices, inventory drawdowns and ``only moderate decreases'' in
government subsidies are the main reasons for forecasting 1988 net
cash income in a range of $55 billion to $60 billion.
   ``However, the fortunes of individual farmers have changed
sharply, some gaining from higher prices received and others losing
from heavy crop losses or higher (livestock) feed costs,'' the
agency said in its new outlook report.
   Net cash income is the amount of money farmers have to spend
during the year and represents the difference between gross cash
income and cash expenses. For example, 1988 sales of grain stored
from harvests in earlier years are counted as part of the current
gross.
   Another method of USDA bookkeeping measures ``net farm income''
for the calendar year, not simply the cash-in, cash-out system
involved in ``net cash income.''
   In this method, changes in the value of farm inventories are
taken into consideration, and allowances are made for ``non-money''
items such as depreciation, the family consumption of farm-grown
food and the net rental value of dwellings.
   Net farm income in 1988 was forecast at $38 billion to $43
billion, also unchanged from the September report but down from
1987's record $46.3 billion.

   Four more political parties entered the
political arena Thursday, bringing to 28 the number registered with
the hard-line military government.
   State radio said the four are the Patriotic Youths Organization,
Youths Union for Burma's Progress, All Burma Democratic People's
Power Organization and the National Progressive Youths of Burma.
   Analysts said none of the four were politically significant,
with the possible exception of the Progressive Youths, which is led
by pro-communist lawyers who were student leaders.
   The All Burma Democratic People's Power Organizations includes a
number of lesser known film actors, directors and poets.
   Gen. Saw Maung ended weeks of massive anti-government protests
Sept. 18 by calling troops into the streets to shoot unarmed
demonstrators. The government says more than 450 people have been
killed in the law-and-order drive.
   But the government has allowed the formation of political
parties to contest a general election to be held sometime in 1989.
   Rangoon Radio also announced a ban on making, selling and using
firecrackers in the capital and other towns. During the annual
Buddhist Festival of Lights, which will be celebrated next week,
children traditionally set off firecrackers and other fireworks.
   Opposition leaders fear that the tight control over virtually
every aspect of life indicates free and fair elections will not be
possible.
   The government has pledged to remain neutral, but it is widely
believed that the power elite will back the National Unity Party,
which under a different name exercised unchallenged control since a
1962 military coup.
   The coup was staged by Gen. Ne Win, who formally retired in
July. But diplomats generally agree that Ne Win is still the real
power.

   George Bush, raiding turf that his aides say is
slipping away from Michael Dukakis, dramatized his campaign's
anti-crime message Thursday by accepting a police shield from the
father of a slain officer.
   Along with the badge of officer Edward Byrne came the
endorsement of about 30 police organizations, including the
40,000-member Police Benevolent Association of New York.
   ``It's time for America to take back the streets,'' declared the
Republican presidential nomineee in accepting the endorsments. He
called them ``an exclamation point'' for his campaign.
   Bush campaigned in New York and New Jersey and planned a Monday
foray into Connecticut, Maine and Vermont.
   Dukakis' Northeast political base ``is cracking,'' said Bush's
national political director, Rich Bond. ``We want to make his
electoral math impossible for him.''
   Bond said Bush was comfortably ahead in New Jersey and at least
drawing even in heavily Democratic New York.
   Bush was to share the dais later Thursday with Dukakis at the
annual Alfred E. Smith dinner sponsored by the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of New York, a nonpartisan event that benefits Catholic
charities.
   The vice president accepted the police endorsements at a
Catholic high school in Queens, not far from the site where officer
Byrne was gunned down last February in his car while guarding a
witness in a drug case.
   Matthew Byrne, a retired New York police lieutenant, said he was
giving Bush his son's shield and commendation bar ``because we
believe he and his administration will stand up for us.''
   ``I was a police officer long before I was a grieving father,''
said Byrne, who also said he sided with Bush's advocacy of the
death penalty for those who murder police officers.
   Bush pinned the commendation bar on his lapel, and said Byrne
and the families of other slain police officers were ``not alone in
their mourning.''
   ``These tragic instances stand as a cruel reminder'' that the
war against drugs ``is a shooting war,'' Bush said.
   For the latest police endorsements, the Bush campaign selected
Christ the King High School, in the middle of a row-house lined
heavily blue-collar Democratic neighborhood.
   Once represented in Congresas by 1984 Democratic vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, the district is heavily
populated with ``Reagan Democrats,'' Democrats who voted Republican
in 1980 and 1984.
   The endorsements ``send a very powerful message,'' said Rep. Guy
Molinari, Bush's New York campaign manager. ``It will be very
helpful to the vice president and detrimental to Michael Dukakis'
position.''
   Bush had previously picked up similar police backings in Boston,
Hartford, Conn., and Patterson, N.J., while Dukakis has also
received a number of law-enforcement endorsements.
   Throughout his campaign, Bush has been seeking to depict Dukakis
as soft on crime, touting his own police endorsements and referring
repeatedly to a former Massachusetts prison program that permitted
some first-degree murderers to be released on weekend furloughs.
   On Thursday, Bush called that program ``disgraceful.''
   Phil Caruso, president of the New York Police Benevolent
Association, called Dukakis' past suppprt for the prison fulough
program ``maniacal'' and referred to the Democratic candidate as
``cut-em-loose Duke.''
   Other police groups endorsing Bush Thursday included the
Metropolitan Police Conference of New York State, the Port
Authority Police Benevolence Association and the Police Conference
of New York.
   Earlier, the vice president told a predominently Polish-American
audience of about 600 in South River, N.J., that he would deal with
the Soviets with a firm hand and suggested that Dukakis would not.
   ``He has a different concept of a strong presidency than I
have,'' Bush said, asserting that Dukakis would not have the
capability of acting quickly when U.S. interests were threatened.
   Despite recent reforms within the Soviet Union, Bush said, ``old
ambitions die hard. ... The leaves may be falling but the trees are
fundamentally the same.''

<TEXT>
   Blowing out the candles and making a wish
may get you a rendition of ``Happy Birthday to You,'' but you can't
buy it for a song. The ditty is for sale for at least $12 million,
says the company that owns it.
   Cooed by Marilyn Monroe to President John F. Kennedy, sung
recently by 90,000 fans to Michael Jackson, and a staple of
children's birthday parties for almost a century, the song that
seems ageless while reminding us we aren't is on the block with the
other musical holdings of Birchtree Ltd. of Princeton.
   ``The first six notes of `Happy Birthday' are as recognizable as
the first four notes in Beethoven's `Fifth Symphony,''' said Gary
Hanson of the Cleveland Orchestra. ``Of course, `Happy Birthday' is
played a lot more than Beethoven.''
   David Sengstack, chairman of Birchtree, said he can only guess
what made the song so popular.
   ``I think it was the movies that did it,'' he told The New York
Times.
   Translated into dozens of languages, the composition began as a
classroom greeting in 1893 with Louisville, Ky., teachers Patty
Smith Hill and her sister, Mildred J. Hill. The two kindergarten
and Sunday school teachers wrote the song, with the lyrics ``Good
morning to you,'' as part of a book ``Song Stories for the Sunday
School.''
   Since then, it has become one of the three most popular songs in
the English language along with ``Auld Lang Syne'' and ``For He's a
Jolly Good Fellow,'' according to the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   Birchtree, which owns the copyright to about 50,000 titles, says
royalties will still be coming in until the year 2010, when the
copyright expires. It brings it about $1 million a year, according
to the Times.
   ``Everybody uses it,'' said Kate Shen, a spokeswoman for
Birchtree. ``It gets used in movies and plays and greeting cards,
music boxes, television shows and commercials. It's just about
everywhere.''
   Even underwear.
   The company objected when Frederick's of Hollywood advertised
underwear that played ``Happy Birthday.'' But it had no problem
when Casio programmed the song into digital watches that play it
every hour on the watch owner's birthday. The song brings Birchtree
a penny a watch.
   A lawsuit against Postal Telegraph in the 1940's attempted to
keep the song from being used in singing telegrams. But the suit
was dropped when lawyers argued that even though it was sung for
profit, it was not heard in public.
   Since then, the song has been used _ and paid for _ in the films
``10,'' ``The Great Santini,'' ``Oh, God,'' and ``Fame.''
   ``I don't know really why it became so popular,'' Ms. Shen said.
``It seems to bring out the little kid in a lot of people. It's
something we've all grown up with.''
   The song's melody originally had the lyrics: ``Good Morning to
you, good morning to you, good morning, dear children, good morning
to all.'' Only later did the sisters add the birthday lyrics.
   A copyright was issued on the song in 1935 to Clayton F. Summy
Co., of Chicago, a sheet-music retailer that published the Hill
sisters' work. A New York accountant eventually purchased the song
and then sold it to the Sengstack family, which owns Birchtree.

<TEXT>
   At least 750,000 U.S. children are taking
stimulant medications to curb their overactivity or
inattentiveness, but researchers said Thursday it is not known how
many are getting the drugs appropriately.
   ``Medication treatment for hyperactive children in the United
States has emerged from its minor treatment role in the 1960s to
become dominant child mental health intervention in the late
1980s,'' the researchers said.
   ``A national estimate of 750,000 youth receiving (stimulant)
medication in 1987 can be viewed as a conservative one,'' they
wrote in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   For reasons unclear to scientists, drugs that otherwise are
stimulants act on the central nervous system to calm hyperactive
children, improve their attention spans and concentration and
reduce impulsive, disruptive and aggressive behavior.
   A furor has arisen over giving children stimulants such as
Ritalin, Dexedrine and Cylert. They once were prescribed mainly to
stem hyperactivity, but now also are given to non-hyperactive
children who have trouble paying attention, the researchers said.
   Both uses are appropriate if a youngster has a problem that
meets the strict psychiatric definition of ``hyperactivity'' or
``attention deficit,'' or a combination of the two, the researchers
said.
   ``If present trends continue, over 1 million U.S. children will
be receiving stimulant medication by the early 1990s, with possibly
one-fourth ... receiving the medication for inattentiveness
associated with a learning impairment,'' the researchers said.
   Dr. Daniel J. Safer, lead author of the study and regional
director of child mental health services for the Baltimore County
Health Department, said more research will be needed to determine
how many youngsters nationally are getting the drugs appropriately.
   But previous findings in Baltimore County, where 6 percent of
schoolchildren are given stimulants, left him ``generally
reassured,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   He said teacher ratings indicated that more than 90 percent of
children studied had clearly improved after taking the drugs, and
three-quarters of them had improved by more than 50 percent.
   ``We can't speak for the country, but in Baltimore Countny, we
feel the medication was generally quite appropriate,'' he said.
   Estimates of the national prevalence of stimulant use were drawn
from drug company estimates of production and school surveys, the
researchers said.
   At least 13 lawsuits in four states and the District of Columbia
have been filed on behalf of parents distressed at the effect of
Ritalin on their children. In one, for example, parents claimed the
drug caused insomnia, depression and loss of appetite in their son,
who was later diagnosed as having a brain injury not treatable with
the drug.
   Defendants in the cases have included pediatricians,
psychiatrists, teachers and school districts.
   A 19-year-old Los Angeles-based group called the Citizens
Commission on Human Rights, a long-standing opponent of psychiatry
and linked to the Church of Scientology, has made the goal of
banning Ritalin an all-out campaign. It has been instrumental in
many of the lawsuits.
   It claims the drug is highly addictive and is being given to 14
million children, putting them in ``a chemical straitjacket'' and
predisposing them to delinquency. The group says teachers and
schools are pressuring parents into giving it to troublesome
children.
   Russell Barkley, director of psychology at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, has acknowledged that
some children are being medicated unnecessarily by medical
professionals who, among other things, are ``seeing the children
once a year and renewing the prescription by telephone.''
   But Safer characterized the California group as ``a few vocal
people who want to make a name for themselves.''
   ``There is clear agreement among physicians that the medication
is useful and that side effects were usually temporary and minor,''
he said.

   Two cosmonauts spent more than four hours outside
the Mir orbital platform Thursday to replace a faulty component on
an X-ray telescope, a task they failed to accomplish earlier this
year, Tass reported.
   Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov used new tools recently brought
to their space station by a Progress cargo rocket to remove a
detector that had been developed by British and Dutch scientists
for the telescope, the official news agency said.
   Components of the unit melted because of exposure to cosmic
radiation, Radio Moscow reported. Tass said Titov and Manarov
replaced the part with an ``upgraded detector'' that would help
prolong the life of the telescope.
   On June 30, Titov and Manarov tried unsuccessfully to replace
the damaged unit of the telescope, which is mounted on an
observatory module called Kvant attached to the Mir. But the
cosmonauts at that time couldn't unfasten the clasp holding the
detector to the telescope.
   In Thursday's spacewalk, which lasted four hours and 12 minutes,
Titov and Manarov wore new spacesuits that Tass said free
cosmonauts from the need to remain tethered to their spacecraft.
   Tass said, however, that the two men did remain linked to the
Mir because they had to repair the telescope before testing out the
suits.
   The new suits also are equipped with new life support systems,
and the wearer communicates by radio, Tass said.
   While outside the Mir, they also installed a fastener near the
airlock that will be used in a joint Soviet-French mission
scheduled for next month, Tass said. It said the fastener would be
used during a Soviet-French spacewalk, apparently to keep the
cosmonaits tethered to the Mir.
   Titov and Manarov also fastened a radio aerial to the outside of
their spacecraft, Tass said.
   The two Soviets have been aboard Mir since December and are
scheduled to set a new space endurance record before returning to
Earth before the end of the year, Soviet officials have said.
   A third cosmonaut, Dr. Valery Polyakov, arrived aboard Mir in
September to monitor the health of Titov and Manarov. Polyakov
stayed inside the station Thursday to check on-board systems, Tass
said.
   The Mir was launched Feb. 20, 1986, and the Kvant orbiting
observatory was attached to it in early 1987.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis drew
comparisons with the Watergate scandal Thursday in accusing George
Bush of distorting his record.
   ``Above all, the truth should matter a lot in a presidential
campaign because as we learned in Watergate, it matters a lot in
the Oval Office,'' Dukakis said. He said that in the Bush campaign,
as in the Nixon White House, ``truth was the first casualty.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee, struggling to catch up with
the vice president less than three weeks before the Nov. 8
election, raised the issue of abortion in depicting Bush as
insensitive to the needs of struggling families.
   Referring to Bush's opposition to a woman's right to an abortion
in most cases, Dukakis said: ``George Bush wants the government to
make one of the most personal choices a woman can make. ... I
believe a choice that personal must be made by the woman herself.''
   He recalled that Bush had said, during their first debate on
Sept. 25, that he was undecided whether women who receive abortions
in the event they are declared illegal should be punished as
criminals.
   Dukakis did not mention that the day after the debate, Bush said
through campaign chairman James Baker III that he believed those
women should be treated as victims rather than criminals.
   Dukakis raised the abortion issue in a speech to telephone
company employees in New Haven, Conn., that was aimed at appealing
to working women and struggling families.
   He recalled the transgressions of the Watergate era when he
renewed his complaint that the Republicans had deliberately
distorted his record.
   ``Truth was the first casualty in the Nixon White House, and it
has been the first casualty in the Bush campaign,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I believe the American people value the truth in politics. I'm
going to do everything I can to make sure truth wins and that we
win on the 8th of November,'' he said.
   Campaigning in the town where Bush attended Yale University, the
Massachusetts governor strolled through an Italian neighborhood and
spoke to a large street rally crowd.
   Dukakis headed later for New York City to attend the annual Al
Smith dinner, where he was to share the stage with Bush at a
traditional bipartisan campaign event presided over by Roman
Catholic Archbishop John O'Connor.
   The governor seemed unperturbed when informed on his arrival in
New Haven that a Hartford Courant newspaper poll showed him
trailing Bush in Connecticut by 10 percentage points. ``You know
the polls, they go up and down,'' Dukakis told reporters.
   But state Democratic chairman John F. Droney made clear he was
unhappy about the way the Dukakis campaign was being managed.
   ``I just believe that the way his campaign has been handled has
been bad,'' Droney said. ``I think he should have hit harder,
earlier. I don't think we've marketed the product as well as the
Republicans.''
   Droney said other Democratic state chairmen around the country
have expressed similar concerns to ``the higher-ups in the Dukakis
campaign.''
   Dukakis press secretary Dayton Duncan said the candidate had
purchased five minutes of time on the ABC television network,
starting at 9:55 p.m. EDT Saturday, to broadcast an address to the
nation that was being taped Thursday.
   In Connecticut, the Dukakis campaign outlined a proposal aimed
at helping parents hold jobs while caring for young or sick
children. It includes a guarantee for unpaid parental leave without
threat of firing for up to 10 weeks to care for a newborn, newly
adopted or sick child or an ailing parent.
   If elected president, Dukakis said, he would issue an executive
order allowing parental leave for federal workers and would work
with Congress ``to assure that all employers, except small
businesses, provide family and medical leave to their workers.''
   Dukakis said Bush ``doesn't care'' that working women are paid
an average of 64 percent of males' earnings, and pledged his
support for pay equality.
   ``George Bush likes to talk about family values ... he talks
about `a kinder, gentler nation,''' Dukakis said. ``But his record
sends a very different message.
   ``His record tells working women, `I don't care if you're forced
to choosebetween the jobs you need and the children you love',''
Dukakis said.
   The Democratic nominee asserted again that he _ and not Bush _
represents middle-class America.
   ``Was he on your side when those Republicans in Congress said
`no' to letting working people take time off to care for a sick
child, or a sick parent or grandparent, without living in fear of
losing their jobs?'' Dukakis asked.
   ``Was he on your side when those Republicans in Congress said
`no' to American parents who want day care for their children?''

   Ritualistic beatings apparently were a
routine part of athletic training for 55 children who were taken
into protective custody after they were forced to watch the beating
death of an 8-year-old girl.
   The children, mostly from the Watts area of Los Angeles, were
kept in a sparsely furnished four-bedroom farmhouse near Sandy,
about 30 miles southeast of Portland.
   Authorities say the children were subjected to whippings of up
to 800 strokes with a paddle or electrical cord while the others
were forced to watch and keep count.
   The beatings were an integral part of the group's program to
heighten athletic performance, much like harassment used in
military training, said Donald Welch, director of the Clackamas
County Juvenile Court.
   Although the children were removed from the house a week ago,
parents have made no attempt to reclaim the youngsters, said Alice
Galloway, spokeswoman for the state Children's Services Division.
   Many of the parents came to Oregon and set up interviews with
social workers, but canceled them abruptly at the request of
Ecclesia Athletic Association founder Eldridge Broussard Jr., she
said.
   The parents display ``no lack of confidence in Eldridge
Broussard,'' she said. ``They trust him implicitly.''
   The dead child was Broussard's daughter, Dayna Lorae.
   In an appearance on Oprah Winfrey's syndicated television talk
show Thursday, Broussard blamed negative news coverage for his
daughter's death.
   He also denied that children were beaten or abused, saying they
were only ``spanked.''
   ``Abuse may be anything that does not prepare them to be on
their toes in a rather paranoid, trigger-happy Los Angeles
situation,'' he said. ``We teach our children the moment someone of
authority says something to you, you snap to it.''
   Asked why he thought his daughter was dead, Broussard said,
``The Lord determined we were supposed to pass through this right
now.''
   He said the standards of discipline were much different between
Oregon and gang- and drug-ridden Watts.
   ``In Watts, parents have seen brutality that would trip the mind
of the average American,'' he said. ``The people that are a part of
my school, when they see brutal, they see ears coming off, they see
giant huge lacerations.
   ``I wish someone would come from Los Angeles and examine these
children. I contend ... we would get conflicting reports.''
   The Ecclesia Athletic Association first used the farm as an
athletic training camp a year ago.
   Broussard formed Ecclesia in 1975 to steer children away from
drugs and crime and to motivate them through tough discipline and
athletics. It is now operating under the auspices of the Watts
Christian Center, founded by Broussard's father in the 1950s.
   Broussard, a former college basketball star, said negative
publicity when Ecclesia arrived in Oregon last year cost his group
financial backing and led to suspension of its activities a year
ago. As a result, Broussard said, staff members were performing
duties they weren't qualified for.
   On Oct. 14, four of the group's staff members took the Broussard
girl's body to a nearby fire station. She had been beaten and
whipped, and died from multiple blunt force injuries, Medical
Examiner Larry Lewman said.
   That night, 53 children were taken from the house, where they
were sharing sleeping bags on the floor. Investigators said the
children, ranging in age from 1{ months to 16 years, had eaten only
a tomato apiece that day.
   Two other children involved with the group were taken into
custody in Los Angeles.
   Broussard, who came to Portland from Los Angeles after the
girl's death, said in a statement addressed to the news media:
``Now, murder's involved. And I accuse you on national television
of murder in the first degree.''
   Broussard, 35, was a basketball star at Pacific University in
Forest Grove, Ore., and later tried out with the Portlan Trail
Blazers, surviving until the final cut.
   He later won praise in Los Angeles for the sportsmanship and
good manners of the Ecclesia youngsters, after the group renovated
a gymnasium and formed a 32-team basketball league.
   Last year, Broussard's organization brought more than 70 adults
and children to the Oregon farmhouse to form an athletic training
center for the children. The group proposed living in tents on an
18{-acre farm, using portable toilets and showers.
   Neighbors opposed the plans, expressing concern over the
``militaristic'' treatment of the children, who they said appeared
to be doing mostly manual labor and calisthenics.
   They also pointed to an Ecclesia ``vow of poverty'' that
required the signer to ``declare all of my ambitions, desires, past
and future commitments, relationships, expectations, assets, gifts,
talents and connections under the total control of Eldridge John
Broussard Jr. ... I relinquish even the rights of decision-making.''
   Ecclesia withdrew its zoning permit applications and returned to
Los Angeles two months later.
   The children were returned to Oregon in late July and had been
scheduled to return to Los Angeles as soon as a new youth center
was completed, said Broussard's spokeswoman, Carolyn Van Brunt.
   Six of Broussard's associates have been charged in connection
with the girl's death: four with manslaughter and two with
hindering prosecution. Broussard's brother Alvin was arrested for
investigation of child endangerment at the Watts Christian Center.

   Favorable winds Thursday buoyed hopes for
three whales trapped in Arctic ice as a huge military helicopter
again headed out to slowly drag an icebreaking barge from Prudhoe
Bay.
   While the whales still were 200 miles away from the open water
of the Chukchi Sea, an easterly wind was breaking leads, or
pathways, in the vast expanse of pack ice near the whales, said
Gary Hufford of the National Weather Service. It was pushing the
ice east and north, away from shore, and the forecast called for
east winds and a slight warming trend until Tuesday.
   ``But weather is an unpredictable beast,'' Hufford said.
   A satellite photograph Thursday showed the ice was cracking open
all over the Arctic Ocean and Chukchi Sea, Hufford said, but
sub-zero temperatures were quickly freezing any open water.
   The animals were trapped about 100 yards off the desolate Arctic
Ocean coast about two weeks ago by bitter cold and the constantly
shifting ice pack. They have been breathing through small air holes
about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo village.
   While biologists earlier worried that the animals were fading,
they said the giant mammals' respiration rates have stablilized.
   ``You can set your watch by them _ every 10 minutes,'' said
Craig George, a North Slope Borough biologist.
   Biologists named the whales Bonnet, Crossbeak and Bone _ the
latter having much of its snout scraped away by the ice. Eskimos
have given them their own names: Siku (Ice), Putu (Icehole) and
Kanik (Snowflake).
   The whales were at least three miles from the nearest lead, and
whether they would make it to open water was uncertain.
   ``Whether they will be able to navigate lead-to-lead to get to
the open water, I don't know,'' said Ted Meyers, National Marine
Fisheries Service chief of habitat conservation in Alaska. ``They
must go through areas of ice for some distance before they reach
open sea.''
   At the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, a huge Army National Guard
Skycrane helicopter lifted off after first light and prepared to
hook onto the 185-ton barge and begin the 230-mile journey to the
whales. The trip was expected to take 25-40 hours. That means the
barge could not arrive at Point Barrow before sometime Friday.
   The helicopter and propulsionless barge progressed only five
miles Wednesday before the operation was halted because of
darkness. The rescue effort had been delayed more than two days by
freezing weather, equipment repairs and mud bogging down the barge,
which had to be relieved of excess weight.
   The Army National Guard said a second Skycrane assigned to the
towing mission may be diverted to lift a 9,000-pound reinforced
concrete cylinder to Barrow where it will be used to smash holes
through the ice.
   ``They are not going to send it to Barrow until they are sure
they will not need it here,'' said Sheryl Deveau, a spokeswoman for
the Alaska National Guard at Prudhoe Bay.
   Two generator-powered de-icers provided by a Minnesota family
business were keeping the whales' breathing holes clear, allowing
biologists and whalers to take a break. They had been using
chainsaws around the clock to keep the holes open.
   The 24- to 30-foot-long California gray whales, whose species is
endangered, became trapped in the ice two weeks ago while migrating
south. The species, which numbers about 20,000 and has been growing
at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, spends
winters in the warm waters off Mexico and Southern California.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Campaigns Compared in Forum at AP Managing Editors
Gathering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bad news for newspapers this presidential
election season is that most voters follow the campaign on
television, political columnist Jack Germond told the Associated
Press Managing Editors convention Thursday.
   ``We are not in on the making of the agenda,'' Germond told the
audience of 300 newspaper editors. ``If we think we are, we're
fooling ourselves.''
   Germond was the lone journalist in a forum titled ``All About
George Bush,'' convened during the weeklong convention. Wednesday's
schedule included a panel called ``All About Michael Dukakis.''
   Despite the designated subject of Thursday's panel, the
discussion quickly became a comparison between the campaign run by
the Republican vice president and his Democratic rival for the
White House, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   ``American voters have decided that Mike Dukakis can't take
direction and that George Bush is more in tune with the
electorate,'' said Maine's Republican Gov. John McKernan, who was
there to speak for Bush.
   ``He has been successful at painting Dukakis as being out of the
mainstream, the dreaded Big L (liberal),'' McKernan said.
   McKernan said New England as a whole is doing well economically
and he received the biggest laugh of the 90-minute session when he
minimized Dukakis' role in the economic comeback of Massachusetts.
   ``We ought to give credit where credit is due,'' he said, ``and
Dukakis has been smart enough to stay out of the way of progress.''
   John Martilla, a market researcher and active Democrat,
predicted the race could be closer than it appears from current
polls, which give Bush a sizable lead. ``Conventional wisdom has
been so wrong this year,'' Martilla said. ``... There is still room
here to bring this back in Governor Dukakis' direction.''
   He said Dukakis' problem is partly that he is ``carrying a
legacy of failure of the Democratic Party at understanding the
basic values of the American people.''
   Another panelist, GOP strategist David Keene, picked up this
point.
   The Bush campaign is run by men and women with a good
perspective on national concerns, Keene said. Their counterparts
working for Dukakis are bright but too ideological and parochial,
he said.
   One result was the way Bush altered the public perception of
Dukakis.
   ``Bush seized on issues of little substance (such as) the Pledge
of Allegiance, prison furloughs ... that created a caricature
Dukakis couldn't escape from,'' Keene said. In this way, Bush
changed the perception of Dukakis' message, he said.
   Germond had the last word.
   ``We have had the most wretched campaign we have seen,'' the
veteran journalist said. ``It's a campaign of shameless irrelevance
by the vice president and staggering ineffectuality by Dukakis. ...
   ``Dukakis has been a terrible candidate because he failed to
understand you have to understand voters are taking a risk electing
a new person.''
   Newspapers do their best to be fair, at times being too
evenhanded when the campaigning gets nasty, Germond said. But
voters look to TV to follow the campaign, not to newspapers, he
said.
   He faulted the networks for generally uncritical reporting and
``devotion to the good piece of film.''

   Scientists have devised a way to make crops
survive a biodegradable weed-killer, a method they said may save
farmers money, boost crop yields and protect the environment from
heavy use of toxic herbicides.
   ``The potential benefit is mind-boggling,'' Terry Medley of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said of the study by Calgene, of
Davis, Calif., and similar efforts by Monsanto Co. and E.I. du Pont
de Nemours & Co. to develop herbicide-resistant crops.
   Such crops ``will save the farmer money, and give the farmer the
ability to spray less herbicide and use an environmentally safe
herbicide,'' said David M. Stalker, author of a study published in
Friday's issue of the journal Science.
   Stalker and other molecular biologists at Calgene said they
successfully removed a gene, or hereditary instruction, from soil
bacteria and inserted it into tobacco plants. The gene makes the
plants produce an enzyme that destroys the biodegradable herbicide
bromoxynil, said Roger Salquist, Calgene's president and chief
executive officer.
   The plants survived without damage when sprayed with eight times
the dose of bromoxynil that normally kills them, said the study by
Stalker, Kevin McBride and Lorraine Malyj.
   Calgene scientists also engineered tomato and cotton plants to
resist the weed-killer, Salquist said.
   Bromoxynil-resistant crops should let growers reduce their
chemical costs because bromoxynil belongs to a new class of
weed-killers that are used in relatively low doses and don't
persist in the environment, said Salquist, Stalker and Jodie S.
Holt, a plant physiologist at the University of California,
Riverside.
   ``Those are chemicals we want to keep on the market, as opposed
to using older, more toxic and more persistent chemicals,'' Holt
said.
   ``Something that would allow use of this new generation of safer
herbicides is important,'' said Medley, the USDA's director of
biotechnology and environmental coordination. ``The benefit to
society, not just to the farmer, can be great.''
   Salquist said bromoxynil now is used only to kill weeds in
fields of crops that resist it naturally, including corn, wheat and
barley.
   Calgene's study was funded by Rhone Poulenc Agrochemie, the
French firm that sells bromoxynil under the name Buctril. Salquist
said Calgene and the French company obviously want to make money
selling seeds for Buctril-resistant crops and Buctril itself, but
farmers and the environment also will benefit.
   Some genetically engineered plants produce fewer seeds. But
Salquist said field tests of Calgene's altered tomatoes showed no
damage to their yields.
   Genetically engineered crops tolerate bromoxynil well, so they
should have higher yields than natural crops that are sprayed with
other herbicides that slightly stunt crop growth while killing
weeds, Stalker said.
   The Calgene-owned Stoneville Pedigreed Seed Co. of Mississippi,
the nation's second leading producer of cotton seeds, plans to
market bromoxynil-resistant cotton seeds by 1992, Salquist said.
   He estimated use of the seeds and bromoxynil should reduce the
$382 per acre cost of growing cotton in the Mississippi Delta by
$46 to $57, including reduced herbicide costs and increased crop
yields.
   One theoretical concern is whether bromoxynil's breakdown
products could be toxic to humans who eat plants sprayed with the
herbicide. Holt said those chemicals occur naturally in corn,
wheat, rye and oats _ which have natural resistance to the
herbicide _ and are not known to be toxic.
   Stalker said he expects ongoing studies will show that
bromoxynil is completely broken down in the resistant crops,
leaving no residue.
   Another concern is that weeds might become resistant to
bromoxynil, either by crossbreeding with the genetically engineered
crops or because natural selection will favor survival of mutant
weeds resistant to the herbicide while vulnerable weeds die.
   Medley said the USDA found no risk of herbicide-resistance being
transferred sexually to weeds from tomatoes, cotton and tobacco.
Holt said she agreed with Stalker that because bromoxynil breaks
down in a couple weeks, development of mutant, bromoxynil-resistant
weed populations are less likely than with longer-lived herbicides.

   A former USS Stark sailor who can
trace some of his mental problems to a missile attack that killed
37 shipmates is unable to help defend himself on murder charges,
psychologists have told a judge.
   Walter Thomas Taylor remains incompetent to stand trial on
charges he killed a woman and her daughter, according to a report
issued Wednesday by psychologists at Florida State Hospital in
Chattahoochee for Circuit Judge R. Hudson Olliff.
   Taylor, 22, is charged with first-degree murder in the August
1987 slayings of Paula Smits and her 3-year-old daughter, Amanda,
of Mayport. If convicted, Taylor could face the death penalty.
   The killings occurred within days of the damaged Stark's return
to Mayport, its home port.
   The psychologists said they trace some of Taylor's problems to
the May 1987 missile attack in the Persian Gulf on the Stark. The
ship was hit by two missiles fired by an Iraqi jet.
   ``Mr. Taylor did report experience of auditory and visual
hallucinations involving seeing the faces of dead shipmates
superimposed on the faces of others,'' the report said.
   Taylor also experiences flashbacks to the Stark explosion when
he sees an explosion or killing on television, the report said.
   But the psychologists also said Taylor understands the charges
against him, as well as the possible penalties and might be
manipulating the system to avoid his trial.
   Olliff scheduled a hearing for next week to discuss the report.

   President Reagan on Thursday increased import
duties on selected Brazilian products in retaliation for what he
said is Brazil's failure to protect U.S. pharmaceuticals and fine
chemicals from unauthorized copying.
   The president's proclamation said the new duties and the
products to which they will apply will be published in the Federal
Register.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said the products would include paper products,
antibiotics, microwave ovens, television cameras and record players.
   The order stems from hearings held by the office of the U.S.
trade representative.
   Reagan said Brazil's failure to provide patent protection
``permits the unauthorized copying of pharmaceutical products and
processes that were invented by U.S. firms.''
   He said he determined that the appropriate response was to
impose increased duties of 100 percent on the selected products.
   He said the increases would remain in effect ``for such time as
is appropriate.''
   The trade representative is authorized to modify or terminate
them.

   In a startling turnabout, a Keene woman has
said she lied when she told police and a grand jury that she saw
her ex-husband, Marlow's former police chief, kill a friend 10
years ago.
   Deborah Wentworth, 36, told state police Wednesday that she made
up the story that she saw Robert Chambers hit Russell Bean with an
hatchet in 1978.
   ``I fantasized it (was) true, that I was there, but I know I
wasn't,'' she told the Keene Sentinel. ``It's a horrible thing to
lie.''
   She said she made up the story because Chambers had abused her
during their nine-year marriage and she wanted revenge.
   Bean's body was found buried in Chambers's front yard in March,
after police responded to tips from Chambers' sister.
   Chambers, who divorced Wentworth and then married Bean's wife
about a year after Bean's disappearance, has denied involvement in
the death.
   A grand jury that heard evidence in May, including Wentworth's
story about having watched Chambers kill Bean, refused to indict
Chambers and a second-degree murder charge was dropped.
   Wentworth has an extensive history of mental problems and is an
outpatient at a mental health clinic in Keene. Police would not
comment on whether they would seek perjury charges against her.
   Prosecutors maintain that Chambers still is their only suspect.
   ``The status of the case remains thekov; and
M. Borisyuk, deputy secretary of the Communist Party committee of
the Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the world's worst
nuclear accident.
   Americans chosen include U.S. Reps. Tim Penny, D-Minn., and Curt
Weldon, R-Pa.; Robert Bottoms, president of DePauw University; and
Michael Oppenheimer, a scientist with the Environmental Defense
Fund.
   Alexander Kondyakov, of the Committee of Youth Organizations,
said the summit would build on the three summits between Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Reagan.
   ``We're going to send a kind of message from the emerging
leaders of these two countries to our respective governments saying
this kind of process should continue and develop in different
fields,'' Kondyakov said. ``We'd like to have stable and very good,
normal relations between our two countries which are very important
not only for the destiny for the future of our governments, but
also for the whole world.''
   Commissions of 10 delegates from each nation will meet daily to
discuss 16 areas: Government, arts, business, media, social
service, law, military, labor and management, religion, urban
issues, education, environment, Soviet-American relations, finance,
science and medicine.
   U.S. and Soviet experts and high-level officials will address
plenary sessions, including Gorbachev via satellite and, organizers
hope, the U.S. president-elect.
   The Soviet delegation will arrive in Chicago on a charter flight
from Moscow on Nov. 29 and spend two days there with host families
before flying to Philadelphia. After the seven-day summit, the
Soviets will go to Washington for four days of meetings and
sightseeing.
   The summit, endorsed by both governments, is expected to be
followed by one in the Soviet Union next year.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Original Blessing: A Primer in Creation Spirituality,'' first
published in 1983, is the Rev. Matthew Fox's best known work. Here
are some excerpts:
   
   Patriarchal religions and partiarchal paradigms for religion
have ruled the world's civilizations for at least 3,500 years. The
creation-centered tradition is feminist. Wisdom and Eros count more
than knowledge or control in such a spirituality. Together,
feminist women and men are invited to rebirth a religious vision
that is more creation-centered. And they can have fun doing it,
because play is a grace in such ritual-making and rebirthing. ...
Liberation movements are a fuller development of the cosmos' sense
of harmony, balance, justice and celebration. This is why true
spiritual liberation demands rituals of cosmic celebrating and
healing, which will in turn culminate in personal transformation
and liberation of peoples.
   
   Fall-redemption theology concentrates on sin _ yet sin, after
all, is part of the anthropomorphizing of our existence. For if the
universe is twenty billion years old, human sin is only as old as
humanity or at most four million years old. This means that
fall-redemption theology leaves out nineteen billion, nine hundred
ninty-six million years of divine-earthly history! One result of
this rather substantial lacuna is, ironically, the very
trivializing of sin, the inability to grasp sins like geocide and
ecocide and biocide of which the human race is fully capable.
   
   
   How much of the piety of ``Jesus is my best friend'' or ``Jesus
saves' comes perilously close to pure projection _ when in fact
Jesus, like all the prophets, taught peole to heal themselves and
others, to be instruments of New Creation, and to do works greater
than he did? How much of the gospel, how much of the person and
message and spirit of Jesus Christ has been lost by over
concentration on fall-redemption religion in the West?
   
   
   The universe teaches universality. Without cosmic consciousness
all universality is torn asunder and only parochialisms, ego trips
and with them institutionalized violence reign.
   
   
   It will come as no surprise to anyone to suggest that the
fall-redemption spiritual tradition which has ignored creativity as
our divine birthright and responsibility has not invested heavily
in preaching to us about the motherhood of God. The patriarchal
tradition has pretty much ignored the implications of God's
motherly side and of our responsibility to develop the mother in
ourselves, whether we are women or men, maried or celibate,
heterosexual or homosexual.
   
   
   The motherhood of God is celebrated wherever panentheism is
celebrated, where images of roundness and encircling take
precedence over linear imaging. ... In other words, the work of
every artists, divine or human-divine, is a maternal work. ... At
the same time that patriarchal society has neglected creativity and
mothering's fundamental spiritual and cultural values, it has
elevated sadomasochism to positions of glory in just about all of
our institutions, from medicine to education to religion to
government to the military to sports to business.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' flight attendants won't join
other unions in trying to block the $365 million sale of the
Northeast shuttle to real estate magnate Donald Trump, an attorney
said in court Thursday.
   Union attorney Arthur Luby said the Transport Workers of America
was attempting to negotiate a contract with Trump for the 300
flight attendants who work on the Boston-to-New York-to-Washington
shuttle, the only profitable operation at Eastern.
   Because of ``the very, very difficult working conditions,'' the
union ``couldn't in good conscience go and do something that forces
them to continue to work for Eastern when they might have a chance
to do something to improve their lot,'' Luby told U.S. District
Judge Barrington D. Parker at a hearing on the proposed deal.
   Two other unions, the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers, and the Air Line Pilots Association, have
announced plans to seek a preliminary injunction to block the sale.
   The two unions contend that the deal is part of an attempt by
Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., to undermine the strength of
organized labor. The company says it needs to sell the shuttle to
get needed cash in order to save Eastern from financial failure.
   The unions have sought to use the mandatory bargaining
provisions of the Railway Labor Act to stop Eastern from laying off
employees and cutting operations by the financially troubled
airline.
   Parker, whose order barring Eastern from laying off more than
3,000 employees was overturned last month by a federal appeals
court, gave the two unions until Nov. 21 to request a preliminary
injunction.
   Although he suggested that the unions might be ``baying at the
moon'' in light of the appeals court ruling on the layoffs, Parker
said he considered the shuttle deal ``a discreet issue and I am
prepared to hear arguments on a discreet issue.''
   The shuttle deal is scheduled to be completed on Dec. 15. Parker
indicated he would hold a hearing in the first two weeks of
December, a schedule that sets the stage for another eleventh-hour
court battle between Eastern and the unions.

   An electrical fire broke out Thursday in
the control tower at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,
temporarily suspending operations and diverting 15 flights to other
airports.
   The fire occurred during the crush of noon traffic, one of the
busiest times of day for air travel, and forced evacuation of the
Federal Aviation Administration tower at the world's fourth-busiest
airport.
   Officials said the fire affected takeoffs or landings of 120
flights.
   An unidentified control tower technician who was working on an
electrical panel when the fire broke out was in stable condition
for minor burns, said Jane McKinney, assistant head nurse at the
Harris Methodist HEB Hospital.
   Henry Christensen, an FAA staff member, was unable to say why
the technician was working on the panel. Norm Scroggins, FAA tower
manager at the airport, said when the fire began, the technician,
who worked for a contractor and not the FAA, flipped a wrong switch.
   Scroggins said instead of shutting off power to the panel
containing the short, the technician cut off a circuit that feeds
the entire communication network. Within seconds, though,
controllers were connected to a backup system, he said. Damage from
the fire was estimated at $1,500.
   Planes resumed limited takeoffs and landings about 12:30 p.m.,
and the regional FAA office took over air traffic control, airport
public information officials said.
   Normal air traffic at Dallas' Love Field and a naval air station
nearby also was interrupted for a time so flights diverted from DFW
could land, officials said.
   The control tower at DFW also controls traffic at Love Field,
where Southwest Airlines delayed 15 flights, said Mary Sheets, a
spokeswoman for the carrier. The longest delay was about an hour,
she said.
   Airport officials expected to resume normal flight operations at
DFW by late Thursday.
   Al Becker of American Airlines said the diverted flights were
sent to airports as far as 400 miles away, including Abilene,
Lubbock and Amarillo in Texas and to Tulsa, Okla.
   DFW is the headquarters for American's fleet and a major
national hub for several other airlines, including Delta and
Braniff.

   The University of North Dakota is under
pressure from Jewish leaders to educate students about the
Holocaust with some of the $5 million it was promised by a casino
owner who collects Nazi memorabilia.
   Ralph Engelstad, owner of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino
in Las Vegas and a 1954 graduate of UND, pledged the money to
support the school's hockey program.
   Engelstad has been under fire since it was revealed earlier this
month that he had amassed a large collection of Nazi war equipment
and twice held theme parties celebrating Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's
birthday.
   Engelstad has apologized for the parties and offered to give his
collection to the National Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.
   Morton Ryweck, regional director for the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, said Wednesday that Engelstad's collection and
parties had ``trivialized the Holocaust.''
   Engelstad's apology would mean more if he would rededicate part
of his $5 million endowment to education on the evils of Nazism and
the Holocaust, Ryweck said in a letter to UND President Thomas
Clifford.
   ``In the future, there would be fewer people ignorant about it,
and fewer people who are apt to trivialize it, as was done in Las
Vegas with these parties,'' Ryweck said.

   Michael Dukakis' huge advantage over George
Bush among women has been all but wiped out as the Republican
candidate has gained support among both men and women, a study
indicated Thursday.
   Bush has picked up support from women along with his gains among
men due to a combination of factors, said Ethel Klein, a Columbia
University political science professor who worked on a study for
the Business and Professional Women's Clubs.
   Between May and October the ``gender gap'' between the
preferences of men and women narrowed significantly. Women gave
Dukakis an 18-point lead in a May CBS-New York Times survey, but by
October 8-10, they were favoring Bush at 44 percent to 41 percent
for Dukakis.
   Men meanwhile favored Dukakis by 1 percentage point in May and
Bush by 8 points in the Oct. 8-10 survey, when they were split 41
percent for Dukakis and 49 percent for Bush.
   ``By September, when the general election began in earnest, the
Reublicans took control of the campaign agenda,'' leading to a
general shift in preference toward Bush, Klein said in a written
report.
   She said the Bush campaign was able to attract women by
addressing economic concerns, including health care, work and
family responsibilities and questions of values and ideology at a
time when Dukakis did nothing to lure voters along those lines.
   However, Klein noted, the same message was pulling men to the
Bush corner at the same time.
   ``The gender gap is not going to make a difference in a race in
which all the dynamics are going one way. In this race all the
dynamics are going Republican,'' she told a news conference.
   ``These women are not voting for George Bush because they have
become convinced that Reagan's economic policies worked and
therefore we should stay the course,'' Klein contended in a summary
of the survey. ``Many women who are economically vulnerable are
supporting George Bush because they have no sense of where the
Democrats would lead them.''
   The gender gap that existed at the end of the primary season was
a factor of party affiliation, dislike by women of the Reagan
administration record, economic circumstances and women's greater
uncertainties about the nation's economic future, the study said.
   At that time, Dukakis was mostly unknown and Bush was not well
liked, the study said.
   After the summer nominating conventions, the ``kinder, gentler''
George Bush emerged, in the phrase he used in his acceptance speech
to describe his vision of America.
   ``This new persona revealed a man who played with his
granddaughter in the morning and reviewed the troops after lunch.
Men really liked this George Bush and decided to support him for
president,'' the survey indicated.
   ``Women were less enamored with this George Bush than men,'' but
they did not dislike Bush any more than they had and his negative
ratings among women dropped 6 points between May and September,
going from 34 to 28 percent.
   By September, when character emerged as an issue, male Bush
supporters who strongly liked him and disliked Dukakis accounted
for 31 percent of his support compared to 21 percent among women.
That compared to 9 percent strong support among men and 7 percent
among women in May. The figures grew to 36 percent among men and 28
percent among women in October.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis was strongly liked by 19 percent of the men
and 19 percent of the women in May. That went to 20 percent among
men and 18 percent among women in September, and 22 percent among
both men and women in October.

   Lloyd Bentsen went on the
counterattack against Republican critics Thursday with the
backslapping help of Jesse Jackson and other Democratic allies on a
television hookup with college students in 11 states.
   Michael Dukakis' vice presidential running mate took friendly
questions on more than a dozen issues, from gun control to welfare
reform, during the hour-long session. Several of the student
questioners, selected in advance by the Bentsen campaign,
identified themselves as College Democrats.
   At most of the campuses linked by satellite television, the
Texas senator found a partisan backer hosting a rally.
   Jackson, who was at Memphis State University with Sen. Al Gore,
D-Tenn., told students the 1988 campaign was ``not about Dukakis'
lack of passion, but Bush's lack of compassion and Quayle's lack of
understanding.''
   Said Gore: ``You know George Bush thought Sept. 7 was Pearl
Harbor Day. And he thinks the election has already taken place.''
   Bentsen laid out the same positions he has stressed in his stump
speeches.
   On gun control, he said, ``I wouldn't be on the ticket with a
fella who was going to take my shotgun away from me.''
   He said Republicans ``have talked vaguely of a thousand points
of light and a gentler America _ while savaging the electorate with
vicious negative campaigning.''
   As the microphone switched from city to city, Bentsen received
warm welcomes from such Democratic luminaries as former Kentucky
Gov. Martha Layne Collins; Michael Kennedy, son of the late Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., and actor Rob Lowe.
   Bentsen's press secretary, Mike McCurry, said the event cost
about $14,000 and that about 3,000 students took part. He said the
satellite feed was made available to TV stations nationwide.
   ``Obviously, we're delighted with the format,'' McCurry said.
``It's a great way to campaign in 11 states simultaneously'' with
local reporters at each site.
   Bentsen's popularity on campuses as caught his campaign staff
somewhat by surprise. Some students in the audience at Stanford
University had camped out Wednesday to hear him speak Thursday.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen is BMOC (big man on campus),'' McCurry said.
   Speaking earlier to workers at a General Electric plant in
Louisville, Ky., Bentsen promised to respond to Republican campaign
charges until Election Day Nov. 8.
   ``I'm going to take myself on an assignment,'' he said. ``Every
time they issue a falsehood ... I'm going to take them on and
straighten that one out.''
   Bentsen said the GOP was lowering the level of the campaign by
distorting such issues as the prisoner furlough program in
Massachusetts, where Dukakis is governor.
   ``We have seen the Republicans running on symbols and twisting
the facts,'' he said.
   Bentsen, a World War II veteran, said he took it ``as a personal
insult to me'' that the Republicans were accusing Dukakis of being
weak on defense.
   ``We're going to tell them that you can't devalue the currency
of our democracy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rain Across The Mississippi Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain was scattered across the central third of the nation
Thursday, and some spots got heavy rain.
   A stationary front extended across northern Texas into
southeastern Louisiana with rain falling just north of the front,
and an area of low pressure sliding across the northern Plains
triggered showers over the upper Mississippi Valley.
   The most numerous showers were over Arkansas and into
Mississippi.
   Little Rock Air Force Base got 1.40 inches in the six hours up
to 1 p.m., and Eldorado, Ark., got 1.07 inches.
   Elsewhere, showers and a few thunderstorms developed over
southeastern Texas and northeastern Florida. And a few showers
moved into southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico.
   Hurricane Joan was east-southeast of Bluefields, Nicaragua, with
winds up to 110 mph.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Hibbing, Minn., to 90 at Harlingen and McAllen, Texas.
Thursday morning's low for the 48 states was 12 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   For Friday, widespread rain was forecast from the Great Lakes
through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys into the middle and southern
Atlantic regions. Cool air following a front across western parts
of the Pacific Northwest will scatter rain along the coast.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted from northeastern Minnesota
through the northern Great Lakes into the northern half of New
England; in the 50s from the upper Mississippi Valley through the
lower Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley into southern New England;
in the 80s across the southern two-thirds of Florida and the
western Gulf of Mexico coast, and from northeastern New Mexico into
the valleys of California; in the low to mid 90s across the desert
Southwest; and in the 60s or 70s across much of the rest of the
nation.

   A moderately strong earthquake jarred
residents of parts of Maine and New Hampshire on Thursday, but no
property damage was reported.
   ``It shook the whole house. Pictures on the wall, everything in
it went flopping back and forth,'' said 78-year-old Leo Perron, a
resident of this glacial plains town near the quake's epicenter.
   ``I thought it was a load of lumber falling,'' said Sandy
Endicott, a secretary at P.H. Chadbourne & Co. lumber yard in
Bethel, Maine.
   George Nickerson, a maintenance supervisor at Chadbourne's, said
the temblor ``wiggled the maintenance garage.''
   The Weston Observatory in Weston, Mass., said the quake measured
4.0 on the Richter scale, enough to cause moderate damage. The U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., said the temblor measured
3.9 on the Richter scale.
   Walter Anderson, director of the Maine Geological Survey, said
the difference in the two readings could be regarded as
insignificant.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 4.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 3.5.The San Francisco earthquake of 1906,
which occurred before the Richter scale was devised, has been
estimated at 8.3.
   Thursday's quake struck at 9:09 a.m. and was centered five miles
northeast of Berlin, the Weston Observatory said.
   Authorities said rumblings and booms were reported all the way
from central New Hampshire to Yarmouth on the Maine coast, to
Augusta in the south-central part of Maine.
   Police in Berlin received more than 100 telephone calls Thursday
morning after the quake, but no reports of damage.

   The State Department on Thursday criticized
two Americans who were arrested in Laos earlier this month while
trying to obtain information about any American servicemen who may
still be held in Indochina.
   James Copp of Hampstead, N.C., and Donna Long,of Jacksonville,
N.C., were arrested on Oct. 3 after entering Laos for the purpose
of advertising a $2.4 million reward for the safe return of a live
American war prisoner, department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   ``We understand the motives behind this kind of effort,'' Redman
said. ``But our view is that this could jeopardize ongoing U.S.-Lao
cooperation to resolve the POW-MIA issue.
   ``We also are concerned that any reward reinforces the
perception widely held in Indochina, particularly among refugees,
that information and remains are items of barter.''
   The spokesman said there is no evidence that the previous
attempts to obtain information about American POW's through the
offer of rewards has produced positive results.
   Copp and Ms. Long were arrested in a remote area of Laos for
illegally entering the country and later were taken to the capital,
Vientiane, where they were reported Monday by a U.S. consular
official to have been well treated and well fed, Redman said.
   He said the U.S. government is asking Laotian authorities for a
determination on whether they will be charged or released.
   ``The United States is deeply committed to the return of any and
all Americans who may still be held in Indochina. We believe the
issue can only be resolved through government-to-government
cooperation, which has recently increased in the case of Laos,''
Redman said.
   He said a team of Lao officials next week will visit an Army
laboratory in Hawaii where remains of returned American servicemen
are identified. In addition. U.S. experts soon will visit a site in
Laos where Americans are believed to have died in a plane crash
during the war.
   That visit will occur after the same experts carry out a joint
investigation in Vietnam on the whereabouts of missing Americans.
   Copp and Ms. Long reportedly were aboard a boat that floated to
the Lao side of the Mekong River. They were said to be attempting
to float packets containing reward notices written on U.S. dollar
bills and other paper currency. The river borders on or cuts
through Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam _ where a combined total of
about 2,400 Americans are unaccounted for.
   On Wednesday, three Vietnam veterans said they were prepared to
risk arrest in Laos to publicize their claim that the U.S.
government ignores evidence that some Americans captured in
Indochina are still alive.
   ``This government, this administration, has failed miserably in
their stated highest national priority, the prisoner-of-war
issue,'' said Ted Sampley, chairman of the National Steering
Committee for American War Veterans, a private veterans' lobby
based in Kinston, N.C.

   A special exhibit of works by contemporary
artist Jasper Johns that premiered in Italy last summer opens this
weekend at the Philadelphia Museum of Art for its only U.S. showing.
   But the exhibit doesn't focus on his familiar images of numbers,
targets and American flags.
   ``Jasper Johns: Works Since 1974,'' which runs from Oct. 23
through Jan. 8, 1989, is a survey of Johns' recent work. The
exhibit moves from the ``crosshatch'' paintings of 1974, the
artist's first purely abstract canvases, to his more expressive
personal imagery of the 1980s, culminating in the quartet of
paintings known as ``The Seasons.''
   The exhibition comprises 21 paintings in oil and encaustic, a
process in which the color is suspended in hot wax to produce a
vivid, soft surface. Also included in the exhibit are 10 drawings
and watercolors and a book of prints created in collaboration with
playwright Samuel Beckett.
   The exhibit was compiled by the museum's 20th-century art
curator Mark Rosenthal and Johns himself.
   Rosenthal called it the first major exhibit of Johns' most
recent work and said the goal of the exhibit was to ``isolate'' the
new work from the more familiar. The works come from the artist's
personal collection, the Tate Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art,
and the private collections of Philip Johnson, S.I. Newhouse Jr.,
Robert and Jane Meyerhoff.
   The Johns exhibit won grand prize in June at the 43rd Venice
Biennale exhibit. The Venetian competition, founded in 1895, is the
oldest and most famous continuing international exhibition of
contemporary art in the world. It is held every other year.
   Susan Larsen, an art historian and curator of the Whitney's
permanent collection, called Johns an ``unqualified genius.''
   ``Johns is, above all, a philosopher-painter,'' Larsen said. She
said Johns paintings show the clear demarcation from the realm of
life and objects and the illusory world of painting.
   Rosenthal said Johns ``astounded'' the New York art world in the
1950s because he painted subjects in a calculated way, rather than
indulging in the emotional abstraction then popular.
   ``He paints with this incredible kind of care and juiciness,''
said Rosenthal. ``He played with people's expectations.''
   The exhibit in Philadelphia is grouped chronologically,
following Johns' movement from abstract to figures to shadows
playing on symbols of death. The works use the art medium to
comment on the creation of art over time, layering the medium with
mirrors and images of the artist.
   Born in Augusta, Ga., in 1930, Johns attended the University of
South Carolina. After a two-year stint in the Army in Japan, Johns
arrived in New York City in 1952, where he became friends with
abstract artists Robert Rauschenberg, minimalist composer John
Cage, Dadaist Marcelle Duchamp and Samuel Beckett.
   In the 1950s, Johns produced a series of painting called the
``target'' paintings, in which he chose graphic images _ a target,
flag, or numeral _ to reflect the very nature of those images as
objects.
   Johns extended into sculpture, creating a series of bronze and
sculpmental works of beer cans, bulbs and flashlights. By the early
1960s, he had begun to blur the line between painting and
sculpture, inserting objects into slits in the canvas and applying
sculpmetal directly to the surface of the work.

<HEAD>America Pays Additional $28.8 Million in Back Dues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   the United States paid an additional $28.8
million toward its back dues Thursday, reducing the regular-budget
arrears to $337.5 million, a U.N. spokesman reported.
   Total U.S. arrears to the United Nations, including peacekeeping
operations and specialized agencies, amount to about $570 million.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Gen. Vernon A. Walters,
the U.S. ambassador, delivered the check Thursday. Walters would
not discuss the matter as he left U.N. headquarters.
   The United States has withheld part of its dues in an effort to
force the United Nations to adopt budgetary and administrative
reforms.
   President Reagan announced Sept. 13 that he was satisfied with
progress on the reforms and was approving immediate release of $188
million. That included $44 million for the last fiscal year and
$144 million for the one beginning Oct. 1.
   Two other payments have been made since Reagan's announcement _
$15.2 million in September and $85.6 million Oct. 14.
   That leaves $58.4 million still outstanding of the amount
Washington has promised.
   U.N. officials have said the State Department modified the
Reagan pledge and told Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
some of the money will be frozen until General Assembly adopts an
austerity budget. U.N. sources said the amount was about $59
million.
   The General Assembly's fiscal committee is to take up the budget
in December. A subcommittee recommended the austerity budget, which
also limits emergency spending, last month.
   Fred Eckhard, the U.N. financial spokesman, has said timely
payments by the United States are necessary if the organization is
to pay for new peacekeeping operations in the Persian Gulf and
possible similar missions in South-West Africa, Western Sahara and
Cambodia.
   Reagan has ordered the State Department to work out a plan for
repaying all past dues and assessments. U.N. Undersecretary Joseph
V. Reed has said the State Department told him it would cover three
to five years.

   Police beat and briefly detained
Suriname's military strongman, Desi Bouterse, and seven members of
his entourage after mistaking them for common criminals, the
Surinamese Embassy said Thursday.
   However, a newspaper quoted a police officer as saying the
foreign visitors were not beaten.
   Although he stepped down from the presidency after a civilian
took over this year, Bouterse remains Suriname's army commander and
de facto leader. He was in Brazil as head of a trade mission.
   Suriname lodged a formal complaint with the Brazilian
government, embassy official Ronald Samichar said by telephone from
Brasilia, the capital. Suriname, a former Dutch colony on the
northeastern coast of South America, shares its southern border
with Brazil.
   About 20 state policemen stopped Bouterse and seven members of
his mission Wednesday afternoon as the group strolled along a busy
street in downtown Sao Paulo, Samichar said. Some members of the
group were acting as bodyguards and carrying guns.
   Bouterse and the others at first showed diplomatic credentials,
but police apparently didn't understand the Dutch-speaking
Surinamese and took them for common criminals, the embassy official
said. Portuguese is the language of Brazil.
   The police punched and slapped the Surinamese officials,
handcuffed them and took them to a police station, Samichar said.
After they finally communicated who they were, the eight were
released with apologies, he said.
   The Sao Paulo State Secretary of Security, Luiz Antonio Fleury
Filho, said Thursday that police were investigating the incident.
He added that the attitude of police ``is almost an instinctive and
normal reaction when they encounter armed persons.''
   In Brasilia, the Foreign Ministry said it had asked the Justice
Ministry to investigate.
   The O Globo newspaper of Rio de Janeiro quoted a police officer
as denying that Bouterse and the others were beaten.
   ``They were detained because they were heavily armed, causing
police to suspect they were criminals,'' the officer, identified
only as Captain Coutinho, was quoted as saying.
   ``They were handcuffed and taken to the precinct, where they
said they were Surinamese police officers. After contacts with the
embassy, they were released,'' the officer said.
   The Associated Press could not reach Bouterse at the hotel where
he is staying.
   Bouterse frequently visits Brazil, a major trading partner and
creditor of Suriname. O Globo said Bouterse and his delegation were
expected to return as soon as possible to Suriname.

<HEAD>Remains of Revolt Leader Imry Nagy To Be Buried In Marked Grave</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government will allow the remains
of Premier Imre Nagy, who was executed and secretly buried after
leading the 1956 uprising, to be reburied in a marked grave, a
Politburo member said.
   ``Whatever the circumstances of the death, someone who has lived
in this country deserved to be buried in a (marked) grave,'' Janos
Berecz in a television interview Wednesday.
   Nagy, Defense Minister Pal Paleter and other leaders of the
popular anti-communist revolt were executed in June 1958 and buried
in anonymous graves.
   Berecz, a member of the Politburo, the Hungarian Communist
Party's supreme body, said no date has been set for the burials,
which he called a ``painful and time-consuming task.''
   ``The remains must be exhumed and an agreement reached with the
families concerned,'' Berecz said, adding that the families would
be free to make their own funeral arrangements.
   In an interview with the Dutch news agency Netherlands Press
Association in September, Berecz proposed a monument to Nagy as a
``gesture of humanity and reconciliation.''
   The government has granted a partial amnesty to some leaders of
the 1956 revolt, but has ruled out rehabilitation for Nagy and his
associates.
   The amnesty covers the revolutionaries sentenced to prison for
crimes against the state or those whose death penalty had been
commuted to imprisonment. But the pardon does not extend to those
convicted of treason or espionage or convicted of murder, robbery
or causing danger to the public, the official MTI news agency said.
   No figures were available on how many of the pardoned are still
alive.
   On Oct. 23, 1956, a popular anti-communist revolution broke out
in Hungary. A new coalition government under Nagy declared the
country neutral and withdrew from the Warsaw Treaty Organization.
But Janos Kadar, one of Nagy's ministers, declared a
counter-government and asked the Soviet Union for military support.
   Soviet forces suppressed the revolution and Nagy and some of his
ministers were abducted and executed. Kadar became premier and
nearly 200,000 Hungarians fled the country.

   President Reagan said Thursday he sees the
possibility that the United States could withdraw troops from South
Korea in the near future, but the State Department's top Far
Eastern specialist said there is ``certainly no intention'' to do
so.
   The president, entering a meeting with South Korean President
Roh Tae-woo, was asked by a reporter if he could ``envision a time
in the near future when the U.S. would be reducing its military
presence.''
   Reagan said, ``That is a possibility, but it would not be one of
us just withdrawing _ it would be one of (being) no longer needed.''
   The United States has long had about 42,000 troops stationed in
South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, asked after the meeting about Reagan's remarks,
said the two presidents did not discuss the subject of troop
reduction.
   ``We are not talking about anything taking place at any
particular time,'' Sigur said. ``We have no intention of anything
of that sort.''
   ``We would have to have a firm belief on the part of our country
and the Republic of Korea that the threat from North Korea was
over,'' he said. ``That threat is not over. We have certainly no
intention of changing our policy of maintaining our ground forces
in South Korea.''
   Korean Embassy children and Roh supporters waved flags as Roh
entered Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, before
meeting Reagan. In nearby Lafayette Park, about 50 people staged a
noisy demonstration against Roh's government and the U.S. military
presence in South Korea. The demonstrators' oriental drums,
clashing cymbals and chants of ``Roh Tae-woo, Out, Out, Out. U.S.
Troops, Out, Out, Out,'' were audible as the visiting presidential
party entered the White House.
   Choi Sung-il, chairman of the United Movement for Democracy and
Unification in Korea, said the demonstration was sponsored jointly
by his group and two others, Young Koreans United and the Coalition
of Young Koreans for Reunification of Korea.
   When asked if he detected any indications that the need for the
troops was lessening, Reagan replied, ``I couldn't put my finger on
some definite signs, but I can just say, seeing other areas of the
world that tensions have lessened, if there's a possibility of
that, yes, that should happen.''
   Asked whether he saw a greater prospect of this than when he
took office eight years ago, Reagan said, ``There have been a great
many changes over eight years, and I think it's possible to see
some things that we couldn't foresee then.''
   He said the U.S. role in relations between South and North Korea
``is to be of any help we can.''
   Tensions on the Korean peninsula have been almost constant for
more than 30 years, and Roh seeks accommodation with his country's
communist-ruled neighbor to the North.
   Roh proposed a summit meeting between the two Koreas in a speech
Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly. He called for both
countries to meet with the United States, the Soviet Union, China
and Japan to lay the groundwork for an era of peace and prosperity
in northeast Asia.
   The State Department welcomed Roh's ``imaginative and
constructive policy of reconciliation and accommodation'' although
it did not endorse any specific proposal.
   On Wednesday, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kang Sok
Ju, spoke to the General Assembly and proposed creating a new
nation out of North and South Korea with a shared military command
and a National Assembly with equal representation from both sides.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday the
administration has no plans to remove North Korea from the list of
countries that U.S. officials say engage in international terrorism.
   He added that ``North Korea's well-established track record of
belligerence and state terror makes a very cautious approach to
this issue necessary.''
   But Redman reaffirmed that the United States is reviewing its
policy toward North Korea following the resumption of talks between
the two Koreas at Panmunjom, and the show of North Korean restraint
during the Seoul Olympics last month.
   There had been concern that North Korea would attempt to disrupt
the Olympics.
   A State Department official who briefed reporters on Tuesday on
condition of anonymity said the administration ``will probably have
an announcement'' on policy changes toward North Korea in a few
days.
   ``We certainly want to be responsive to President Roh's policy
changes and what he wants to do,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Aviator Sheila Scott Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheila Scott, an actress-turned-aviator who held
more than 90 flying records, died Thursday of lung cancer at the
age of 61, her literary agent said.
   The agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Miss Scott
died at Royal Marsden Hospital in west London. The hospital refused
to comment.
   Miss Scott, who listened to Rachmaninov and Beethoven on
long-distance flights, learned to fly at the age of 32 and became
the first solo flier to cross the North Pole.
   She also held the record for the longest solo flight ever made,
for an around-the-world flight of 31,000 miles.
   ``People often say to me, `oh you must have been so alone flying
hundreds of thousands of miles, often in appalling weather
conditions' but when you're in the sky you don't think of things
like that,'' Miss Scott told The Sunday Times newspaper four years
ago.
   ``Flying solo can be a spectacular experience _ wondrous cloud
formations, romantic sunsets, or cruel tendrils of black cloud,
cold and eerie,'' she said.
   Born in Worcester, England, in 1927, Miss Scott became an
actress at the age of 18, appearing in repertory theater and later
in films and on television.
   She was married in 1945 to Rupert Bellamy. They were divorced in
1950.
   She learned to fly in 1959 on a dare and worked for her British
and U.S. commercial licenses by racing and flying in long-distance
rallies.
   In 1966, Miss Scott became the first Briton to make a solo
round-the-world trip when she flew a Piper Comanche plane 31,000
miles in 33 days _ 189 flying hours with 32 stops. In 1971, during
her second global flight, she became the first solo pilot over the
North Pole.
   She wrote three books recalling her flying experiences and in
1968 was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire.
   In retirement, she said she would like to do more traveling.
   ``For many years I simply hurriedly flew over countries just
getting a snapshot view. Maybe it's time to linger a little _ and
absorb,'' she said.

   Israelis buried its seven dead Thursday
_ soldiers killed in a suicide car bombing in southern Lebanon _
and vowed revenge against the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems who
claimed responsibility for the attack.
   As the body of Yaacov Ben Shanan, was buried in a military
cemetery here, his youngest daughter and a son who is a regular
army soldier both fainted. Shanan, 44, was a reservist on a week's
duty in Lebanon when he was killed by Wednesday's blast.
   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army detained five Shiites from
southern Lebanon on suspicion of preparing the bomb, Israel radio
reported. It said the militia interrogated about 400 Shiites and
dozens of Sunni Moslems.
   Israel's leaders promised retaliation against the Hezbollah, or
Party of God, the militant organization of fundamentalist Moslems
which claimed responsibility for the bombing.
   ``We have to strike at these people of blood and terror
everywhere and at every opportunity,'' said Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, specifically naming the Hezbollah as ``one of the most
extreme terror organizations.''
   Defense Miister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel radio: ``We will seek
out, reveal and punish those who carried out the terrible crime
yesterday.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he was certain the attackers
would be punished. ``I am sure that the state of Israel and the IDF
(Israeli Defense Force, or army) will not remain still until we
reach the source of evil, the source of the attack.''
   In Israel, six political parties, including Shamir's hard-line
Likud bloc, canceled campaign broadcasts to mourn the dead.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for Nov. 1.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman appealed in Washington
on Thursday for ``security and stability for everyone'' but said
nothing of the threat of Israeli revenge.
   Syrian troops in Lebanon went on alert in anticipation of an
Israeli attack, according to Christian radio broadcasts monitored
in Tel Aviv. The broadcasts said Israeli warplanes flew several
times at low height over Lebanese territory, including the cities
of Sidon and Khalde.
   An army spokesman said Israeli troops in the security zone that
Israel maintains in south Lebanon worked checkpoints and questioned
Lebanese drivers.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, army chief of staff, told Israel radio the
attack could have been carried out by ``maybe two people.'' He said
regulations would be enacted to try to minimize any more bombings.
   The car bomb exploded Wednesday afternoon as two Israeli army
convoys were passing. The vehicle, which carried up to 330 pounds
of explosives, was destroyed, and the body of the suicide driver
was not found.
   The bomb injured eight other soldiers and two Lebanese women. It
was the deadliest attack on Israeli soldiers in Lebanon since a car
bomb killed 12 and injured 14 in March 1985.
   The attack came a few yards from the Israeli border in the
security zone that Israel set up in 1985 when it pulled most of its
troops out of Lebanon, ending a three-year occupation of the south.
Foreign reports say Israel still keeps about 1,000 troops in a
strip up to 10 miles deep along the border.
   On Thursday in South Lebanon, Shiite families were reported
fleeing to the north in fear of an Israeli reprisal.
   Also Thursday, loudspeaker-equipped cars from the Hezbollah
toured South Lebanon, blaring hymns and chants praising ``the
martyr who carried out the heroic attack against the Zionists.''
   At Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, Hezbollah spokesman Ahmad Qamar
said his forces were on alert throughout the country in expectation
of Israeli revenge. He also said the car bomb attack ``will not be
the last one.''
   ``We expect an Israeli aggression any minute and we are
confident that the sons of Islam will be victorious,'' he said.
   At the Holon Military Cemetery near Tel Aviv, a rabbi who prayed
over Yaacov Bar Shanan's grave called the attackers ``vampires ...
bloodthirsty enemies.''

   Officials hospitalized a young woman
Thursday who has been visited by thousands of people since she
claimed early this month to have seen the Virgin Mary.
   ``Due to her health situation, the woman is suffering severe
mental disturbances which are usually accompanied by
hallucinations,'' said Yousef Gharaybeh, head of Amman's public
security department, according to the official Jordan news agency.
   He said nothing about crosses journalists and hundreds of other
witnesses reported seeing on the arms, neck and chest of Lina
Karabashi, 18.
   Gharaybeh said that Mrs. Karabashi was examined by doctors from
King Hussein Medical City, where police took her Thursday morning.
   An investigation ``found that Mr. (Samir) Karabashi was behind
all the false claims'' and he would ``face legal procedures to stop
him from contacting spirits,'' the security chief said.
   Mrs. Karabashi, he declared, ``is a poor, sweet girl who
deserves medical attention.''
   Monsignor Raouf Najar, the senior Roman Catholic official in
this predominantly Moslem nation, expressed anger at how the case
was handled.
   He said a priest was with the woman all day and had not seen her
undergo medical examinations. Hospital sources said a priest was
the only person allowed to visit Mrs. Karabashi.
   While she was in the hospital for a foot operation, crosses
appeared on Mrs. Karabashi's body and she claimed to have seen the
Virgin. She has had 19 operations on the foot, which was crushed in
a childhood accident.
   Thousands of people have gone to her home since she was released
from the King Hussein medical facility two weeks ago. Many brought
rosary beads for her to bless and a few claimed she had cured them
of physical ailments.
   So many people gathered at the Karabashi house that traffic
often was disrupted and police frequently were assigned to crowd
control.

<TEXT>
   A 77-year-old Brazilian Roman Catholic priest
admitted in court Thursday that he acted as a courier for a
Brazilian ring that smuggled cocaine to Italy and claimed the money
he received went to charity.
   ``Every Brazilian priest has a little business on the side,''
the Rev. Lino Christ told the court as he and three other
Brazilians went on trial on charges of violating Swiss narcotics
laws.
   Conviction could mean up to 20 years in prison.
   A co-defendant told the court regarding the clergyman's charity
claim that the priest had a mistress in Copacabana and spent the
money on her.
   Christ, a priest at the parish of Santa Catarina in Rio de
Janeiro, was arrested last December after Geneva airport customs
officials seized nine kilograms of cocaine (just under 20 pounds)
hidden under a false bottom of his suitcase. The cocaine had a
street value of more than $1,750,000.
   The priest first told investigators someone he did not know gave
him the suitcase to deliver upon arrival but the man forgot to give
him the address.
   Customs officials had become suspicious because his passport had
been stamped frequently at European airports. In court, he admitted
Thursday having made several trips between Rio and Milan, Italy,
via Geneva and Zurich, Switzerland, and Copenhagen, Denmark.
Payment for each trip was $10,000.
   The three co-defendants include a woman architect, 36, her
32-year-old boyfriend, and a 42-year-old woman travel agent who the
prosecution says was among the masterminds of the ring.

<HEAD>Senate Sends Revision of Trademark Laws to Reagan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate sent legislation to President
Reagan on Thursday that alters the nation's trademark laws and
makes it easier for companies to sue each other over false
advertising.
   The measure, sent to the White House on a voice vote, would
allow businesses to protect a trademark for three years even if the
product it signifies is not yet for sale. Currently, companies can
only use a trademark if the product is already available to
customers, a requirement that critics say is often ignored by small
firms.
   Some courts have interpreted the existing trademark law to bar
companies from issuing false descriptions of their own products.
The new law makes it illegal for anyone to misrepresent ``his or
hers or another person's goods, services or commercial activities.''

   The majority of the village council in
this tiny community has resigned, leaving the board without a
quorum and the hamlet without a way to pay its bills.
   ``It's been dumped in my lap,'' said Elizabeth VanHore, one of
three remaining council members following last week's resignations.
   Four members quit in part because of a family dispute. With no
quorum, the council is now unable to conduct the business of the
village, which is 25 miles southwest of Traverse City.
   But VanHorn said she and remaining Trustees Emmet Moore and
Wynott Clapp will meet soon to appoint a fourth council member who
in turn will join them in selecting a fifth and restoring a quorum.
   ``What we will do, to be fair, is advertise to anybody who wants
to serve on the council that they send in a resume _ to me, I
guess,'' she said. The council should be able to pay its October
bills and resume business as usual by the time of its next
scheduled meeting Nov. 10, VanHorn said.
   The standstill began during the Oct. 13 council meeting, when
Trustee Ted Kline resigned because he was moving to neighboring
Cleon Township. Village President Don Myers and Trustees Vickie
Mathis and Dennis Collins quit for different reasons.
   ``It just comes down to the difficulties we've had on the
council,'' said Myers, reached at his hardware store.
   Things began simmering last year, when state police investigated
allegations of missing village records and $2,000 worth of gasoline
and oil. No one ever was charged.
   In March, Linda Collins defeated incumbent Betty Collins _ her
sister-in-law and Dennis Collins's wife _ for the clerk-treasurer's
job. Myers said the bad blood resulting from that election and the
state police investigation left the council in constant turmoil.
   ``It got quite personal on a lot of this stuff,'' he said. ``I
just didn't want to be part of it any more.''
   What if no one applies for the openings?
   ``Don't say that to me,'' VanHorn said.

<TEXT>
   The British government introduced legislation
Thursday to abolish the right of suspects in Northern Ireland to
remain silent under police questioning, ending a centuries-old
pillar of British jurisprudence.
   The latest measure in Britain's crackdown on the Irish
Republican Army provoked renewed outcries that historic civil
liberties are crumbling in Britain and followed Wednesday's
government ban on broadcast interviews with members of the outlawed
IRA and 10 other militant groups in Northern Ireland.
   In the House of Commons, the government of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher put forward legislation to end the right to
silence in Northern Ireland, and said it also planned to introduce
similar restrictions in England and Wales. The measure is expected
to become law by January.
   ``Members of terrorist organizations are being trained to refuse
to respond to questions put by the police _ and this technique is
increasingly being adopted by those suspected of serious crimes,
including racketeering,'' Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King said.
   ``Justice is being thwarted,'' he said.
   At present, courts are not allowed to take into consideration
that a suspect refused to answer police questions.
   King said under the new law a judge will be able to draw from
silence ``whatever inferences appear proper.''
   This means a court can regard an accused's refusal to answer
police as an indication of guilt.
   King said the change will be aimed particularly at suspects who
refuse to respond when arrested and then come up in court with a
defense they could have put forward immediately, such as detailed
alibis.
   The new measure was virtually certain of passage in the
650-member Commons where Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives have a huge
101-seat overall majority.
   Opposition Labor Party deputy leader Roy Hattersley said the
right to silence was ``an essential element of a free society.''
   ``To abolish the right to silence is to place a terrible risk
against those who are verbally inadequate, those who are afraid,
who simply are cautious and wish to speak to a solicitor (lawyer)
before saying anything,'' said Hattersley.
   Under a historic 1966 ruling in the case of Miranda vs. Arizona,
the U.S. Supreme Court said police must tell suspects before
interrogating them that they have a right to remain silent, to
confer with a lawyer before answering any questions, and to have a
lawyer provided if they cannot afford to hire one. The court said
such warnings are needed to protect suspects' privilege against
self-incrimination, assued by the U.S. Constitution's Fifth
Amendment.
   Like the broadcast ban, the new measure was part of a security
package promised by the Thatcher government after an upsurge of
killings and bombings by the IRA since this spring.
   Mrs. Thatcher hinted in the Commons on Thursday that the
government might soon require election candidates to swear an oath
renouncing violence. ``If we go ahead with that we will do it by
legislation and will do it at the earliest possible opportunity,''
she said.
   In addition, the government plans to introduce laws this winter
to freeze and seize the funds of guerrilla organizations.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said Thursday that a report on the
right to silence in England and Wales was due in the new year, and
``Legislation will be brought forward at the earliest possible
opportunity.''
   Nothing was said about Scotland, which would require special
amending legislation under its separate legal system.
   The latest announcements provoked fears that the Thatcher
government was sacrificing democratic fundamentals in its battle
against the mainly Catholic IRA's violent campaign to end British
rule in Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland.
   ``Northern Ireland is being used as a laboratory for draconian
measures to be used later in other parts of the United Kingdom,''
said Laborite Kevin McNamara.
   The Republic of Ireland, where the IRA is also banned, already
forbids broadcast interviews with members of the IRA or its legal
political front, Sinn Fein, and restricts suspects' right to
silence.
   Sinn Fein said the latest British move brought Mrs. Thatcher's
government closer to the administrations of Chile and South Africa.
   ``The right to silence is ... enshrined in the legal systems of
most of the world's civilized countries,'' Sinn Fein said in a
statement.
   In Britain, the right dates from the 17th century and was
designed to protect ill-educated suspects from unfairly
incriminating themselves.
   ``Violence cannot be defeated by injustice,'' said Sarah
Spencer, general secretary of the National Council for Civil
Liberties. ``Removing the right to silence amounts to an attack on
one of the cornerstones of our system of justice, that the burden
of proof is on the prosecution.''
   Britain's human rights record in Northern Ireland has come under
consistent scrutiny.
   In 1976, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that
interrogation techniques by Northern Ireland police then
contravened stipulations against inhuman and degrading treatment
and torture.
   Techniques, which police say they have since abandoned, included
hooding of IRA suspects under interrogation, standing them against
walls and depriving them of food and sleep.
   In June, Amnesty International said there were inadequate
safeguards in Northern Ireland against unlawful killings by
security forces. The human rights organization called for an
inquiry into allegations that Northern Ireland police, the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, operated a ``shoot-to-kill,'' rather than
capture or wound, policy against the IRA in 1982.
   Legal rules in Northern Ireland took a fundamental depature from
the those of the rest of the United Kingdom when no-jury, one-judge
courts were introduced in the province in 1973 because of the
difficulty of getting frightened juries to convict or witnesses to
testify at IRA trials.

<HEAD>PTL's Suit Against Bakker Ends, Verdict Expected In A Month</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker's longtime bodyguard disputed
his former boss and testified the television evangelist pushed to
get himself bonuses, as a trial ended Thursday in PTL's $52 million
suit against its founder.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds did not issue an immediate
verdict in the case, which he began hearing in September. But he
indicated he would award a compromise judgment.
   ``I am going to prepare a fair and just adjustment between these
parties,'' he said as the hearing closed.
   ``In bankruptcy court I've seen suit after suit like this one,
and never a dime collected,'' Reynolds said. ``If you can't get $1
million why look for $2 million?''
   ``So if you find the court a little soft in the amounts, then
you can understand why,'' said Reynolds, who is hearing the case
because he is presiding over PTL's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
   The attorneys have until Thursday to submit any further
information or pleas. Reynolds plans to present draft findings
within 10 days of that, and the attorneys will have another 10 days
to submit responses before a final verdict.
   PTL presented testimony and evidence that Bakker and his wife,
Tammy, received about $9.5 million in bonuses, salaries and other
compensation from 1983 to 1987. But Bakker has said he would not be
able to pay a judgment against him.
   The ministry is charging the Bakkers, and an aide, David
Taggart, with mismanaging the ministry into ruin and receiving
excessive salaries and spending ministry money for personal gain.
   PTL received bankruptcy protection in June 1987, three months
after Bakker resigned following a sex-and-hush-money scandal
involving former New York church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker testified his salary and bonuses were approved by the
ministry's board of directors, and that he never requested bonuses
and was not present during meetings in which they were discussed.
   But Don Hardister, who served as PTL's head of security and
Bakker's personal bodyguard during his 11 years there, said
Thursday during rebuttal questioning by PTL attorney Tom White he
``was often present outside of board meetings where he heard
discussion of bonuses between Mr. Bakker and David (Taggart).''
   ``I remember one occasion where Jim was very emphatic that David
ensure Mrs. Bakker receive a bonus,'' Hardister told Reynolds.
   Also during rebuttal questioning Thursday, Dana Cadwell, an
accountant in PTL's finance office, testified that an external
audit in August 1984 showed abuse of the ministry's cash advance
system.
   She said executives of PTL, which operated a satellite
television network and Christian theme park at Fort Mill, failed to
repay advances of up to $10,000.
   ``The audit recommended that we establish a maximum employee
advance amount,'' she said. ``Many of the outstanding cash advances
were over six months old.''
   Bakker said Thursday as he left the courthouse that he's glad
the trial is over.
   ``After two years of what I've been going through, nothing is
humbling. My faith is in God. I believe God will bring me through.''
   ``The real point in this case is that it was built on an IRS
document that is erroneous. It has never been proven. It's a
preliminary report that is not gospel. That is disturbing to me,''
Bakker said.
   The defense has argued that PTL's records have been dispersed as
a result of its bankruptcy, its division into separate for-profit
and church entities and investigations by a federal grand jury and
the Internal Revenue Service, making it impossible for the Bakkers
to justify every payment they received.
   ``As I begin to find the bits and pieces, I become angry. The
documentation is there. If we have to appeal it, we're ready to
go,'' he said.

   Federal agents testified Thursday they saw
three polygamist clan members brandishing and at times firing
weapons during a standoff that ended in the fatal shooting of a
state corrections officer.
   Testimony on the opening day of a preliminary hearing for the
three, charged with second degree murder in the officer's death,
centered on the 13-day standoff with police at the group's Marion
farm last January.
   Third Circuit Judge Maurice Jones will decide after hearing
prosecution testimony whether there is sufficient evidence to bind
the three over for trial.
   Much of the testimony Thursday duplicated that given during an
earlier trial in federal court in which the three were convicted of
a variety of charges related to the Jan. 16 bombing of a nearby
Mormon chapel and the ensuing stalemate with 100 officers.
   Clan ringleader Addam Swapp, 27, his brother Jonathan Swapp, 21,
and John Timothy Singer, 22, have pleaded innocent. Lt. Fred House,
a 35-year-old police dog handler, died Jan. 28 during the
siege-ending shootout.
   House was slain as he was ordering two police dogs to subdue the
Swapp brothers as they walked back to the main farmhouse after
milking a goat. Evidence presented during the federal trial
indicated Singer fired the fatal bullet from a .30-caliber carbine.
   The judge overruled objections by defense attorneys that
testimony about events leading up to the shooting was irrelevant
and inflammatory. Assistant U.S. Attorney Creighton Horton said the
questions were relevant because they showed ``continuing armed
resistance'' by the defendants.
   FBI Agent Richard Intellini testified that Addam Swapp
shouldered and pointed his rifle toward officers on Jan. 28 moments
before House was shot.
   Intellini said House stood in the doorway of another home on the
compound and tried in vain to urge a police dog to subdue the Swapp
brothers.
   When the dog barked, Addam Swapp looked over his shoulder twice,
the second time raising his rifle and pointing it toward the
lawmen, Intellini said, adding that Jonathan Swapp started to slip
his rifle off his shoulder.
   Intellini said he then fired through a window, which shattered
and obscured his view. After he fired, he said he heard several
rounds hitting the house and wood splintering. Soon after, he found
House wounded.
   FBI agent Mike Kelly testified he was at a surveillance post in
a nearby home on Jan. 22 when he saw a window open in the Singer
home and a rifle protrude, then heard a gunshot and saw a muzzle
flash in the direction of the surveillance post.
   Under cross-examination, Kelly said the shot also was in the
general direction of a bank of lights set up by law officers to
illuminate the clan's compound.
   Agent Devlyon Barker said that on Jan. 25 he was taking photos
of the compound when Jonathan Swapp pointed a rifle in his
direction. Others testified of similar instances.
   The three defendants and Vickie Singer, 45, mother of John
Timothy Singer and of Addam Swapp's two wives, were convicted in
U.S. District Court in May on charges related to the bombing and
siege. Addam Swapp was sentenced to 15 years in prison, Mrs. Singer
to five years and Jonathan Swapp and John Timothy Singer to 10-year
terms.
   Addam Swapp, who was seriously wounded in the shootout, has said
the bombing was ordered by God as a sign of the impending collapse
of the Mormon Church and all government, and that it would trigger
the return of family patriarch John Singer, slain by police nine
years before for resisting arrest.
   The clan maintained Singer was killed in a church-state
conspiracy and that the family had been harassed for years by
police and neighbors.

   One of the $41 million engines that powered
the space shuttle Discovery into orbit last month developed a small
cooling-system leak and will be replaced for the ship's next flight
in February, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said
Thursday.
   Layers of nickel and copper, from which the engine's combustion
chamber is fabricated, were found to have separated in one area,
said Jerry Berg, a spokesman at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Alabama. The leak resulted.
   It is too early to tell whether the engine change will affect
the flight schedule, he said.
   The problem was found during a post-flight inspection Wednesday
at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The engine will be removed
and sent back to the manufacturer, the Rocketdyne Division of
Rockwell International Corp., for repair.
   ``It's not possible to tell precisely when it happened,'' said
Berg. ``Pressure tests were conducted before he flight and
indicated the separation was not present.''
   Berg said the leak did not show up on any of the instruments
that monitored Discovery's performance on the first flight since
the Challenger accident in January 1986. ``It only became apparent
once we got into detailed inspection,'' he said.
   Discovery completed its four-day, one-hour mission without a
hitch, landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   NASA officials said workers preparing Discovery's sister ship
for a late November flight will inspect an engine component on
Atlantis to make sure it was not damaged during pre-flight testing
at the Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss.
   Officials were uncertain how the developments would effect
launch dates for Atlantis, scheduled to fly no earlier than Nov. 23.
   The Atlantis inspection was ordered after an engine being tested
for use on space shuttle Columbia sustained damage, said Conrad
Nagel, who is in charge of preparations for the second
post-Challenger mission.
   ``We have no reason to believe we've got a problem,'' Nagel
said, ``but we had a problem on another engine and they've asked us
to go back and look at it on ours.''
   Space shuttles are propelled into orbit by two solid-fuel rocket
boosters that drop off when they are spent and by three engines
that are fed supercool liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen from the
shuttle's huge fuel tank.
   NASA, meanwhile, appointed a board to investigate the fire that
damaged the Magellan spacecraft during a power systems check on
Monday night. The fire resulted when a technician for spacecraft
builder Martin Marietta Corp. forced an electrical plug into the
wrong receptacle.
   The damage to the spacecraft, which is to conduct an eight-month
mapping mission of Venus, is not expected to affect the April 1989
launch date.

<TEXT>
   Catholic intellectuals nationwide are
demanding restoration of the outlawed Solidarity trade union,
loosening of party control on the economy and free access to the
mass media, it was announced Thursday.
   The demands from representatives of 49 Clubs of Catholic
Intelligentsia were listed in anticipation of promised round-table
talks between the opposition and authorities. But a club spokesman
said a ``deep impasse'' with officials was making the talks seem
increasingly remote.
   About 100 representatives of the clubs, one in each of Poland's
49 provinces, adopted the statement at a two-day meeting in the
southwestern city of Wroclaw Oct. 15-16, said Jacek Moskwa,
spokesman for the Warsaw club.
   The clubs, each of which is autonomous, represent about 18,000
lay Catholics nationwide and are considered centers of moderate
opposition to Poland's communist government. Three members of the
Warsaw club declined an invietation from Prime Minister Mieczyslaw
F. Rakowski to join his new government.
   The Warsaw club's president, Andrzej Stelmachowski, is acting as
mediator in setting up the round-table talks promised Aug. 31 by
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak to Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa.
   But Moskwa said it was uncertain when the talks _ originally
scheduled for Monday _ might start. On Tuesday, the government said
they have been postponed until after Oct. 24.
   ``As of today, everything is in a very deep impasse,'' Moskwa
said.
   The sides disagree in their views of the round-table, with the
opposition insisting on ``a place for important decisions'' while
the government wants ``a discussion forum,'' Moskwa said. ``This is
the basic difference.''
   The statement passed by the club representatives said the talks
``should lead to ... principal changes in the shape of public
life.''
   ``We demand restoration of a legal framework of trade union
pluralism, including foremost the legalization of Solidarity,''
said the first of the statement's nine demands.
   ``Fulfilling this postulate is an essential condition for real
reform of political and economic life.''
   Another demand was for separating ``political authority from
economic authority,'' meaning the communist party would abandon
control of enterprises and party that loyalists in the
``nomenklatura'' would cease to get management jobs automatically.
   The statement also called for:
   _``Unrestrained access'' by democratic social groups, churches
and religious communities to television and radio;
   _Freedom to form political organizations, and economic, social
and cultural associations;
   _A system of parliamentary democracy with separation of powers
between the executive, legislature and judiciary;
   _Legalizing private schools and separating state activities in
education and culture from the ideology of atheism. ``The school
should not spread atheism,'' the statement said;
   _An end to all official forms of political indoctrination of
youth and the right of free and democratic social activity for
young people
   _Lifting of a 1957 law allowing legal abortions;
   _Democratization and self-government in rural life, with equal
treatment for private, cooperative and state farms.

   Roger Boas, a failed mayoral candidate who
ran the city under two mayors for a decade, pleaded guilty Thursday
to charges stemming from having sex with teen girls at a brothel.
   Superior Court Judge Timothy Reardon accepted the surprise plea
and set Nov. 18 for sentencing on seven counts of statutory rape.
Twelve other counts were dropped in return for the guilty plea,
which reportedly allows Boas to avoid prison.
   ``I am very sorry for what has happened,'' said Boas at a brief
afternoon news conference at his attorney's office. ``I feel deep
remorse ... I will pay my debt to society. I hope, one day, to
return to that society a forgiven man.''
   The original charges, contained in a secret grand jury
indictment handed up Oct. 3, covered a 2{-year-period from starting
in November 1985, including his final 15 months as San Francisco's
chief administrative office and his 1987 mayoral campaign. He
placed a close third in last year's primary.
   The indictment grew out of a 16-month police probe, during which
five prostitutes testified they had sex with Boas.
   A campaign poster for Boas on Polk Street, a haven for runaways,
was spotted by one of the teen prostitutes and eventually led to
his indictment, according to police reports.
   One of the 17-year-old prostitutes told investigators, who
learned of the brothel about a year before, that she had sex with
Boas some 30 times, adding he called himself ``George'' and liked
to be referred to as ``Daddy.''
   Smith's office recommended a sentence of three years probation,
participation in a 12-month work program; $70,000 in fines or
contributions to programs for wayward and runaway girls; and
continued psychiatric counseling.
   Boas had faced a maximum of three years on each of the felony
counts of statutory rape, although a judge could have ordered the
sentences to be served concurrently.
   A city grand jury handed up the 86-count indictment of Boas and
13 others. Eight of the defendants were alleged customers and the
others were indicted for running the operation.
   Boas, a 67-year-old wealthy car dealer, served as chief
administrator under former mayors George Moscone and Dianne
Feinstein. He resigned in January 1987.

<HEAD>ABC Reports Bradley Maker Has Overcharged Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FMC Corp., the manufacturer of the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle, has been accused by former employees of
overcharging the Army for parts for the armored troop carrier, ABC
News reported Thursday.
   By last December, the Chicago-based company had delivered about
3,100 Bradleys at a cost of $10 billion. Critics of the vehicle,
most of which have been stationed in Europe, say it doesn't work
and is unsafe.
   A report aired on ABC World News Tonight said the network has
obtained documents from the company showing that there were
problems with billing for certain parts on the Bradley.
   ``Sometimes the FMC simply didn't tell the Army what the prices
were. Other times the prices billed were too high,'' ABC reported.
   A man who worked for the government and was assigned by the Army
to audit the cost of Bradley parts told ABC, ``There's been times
that I have caught some excessive prices, quite a few excessive
prices. But there's a lot of things I couldn't do anything about
it.''
   A woman who was in charge of parts billing for the Bradley told
ABC that FMC executives often ordered her to inflate the price of a
part.
   ``Sometimes I would take it to an engineer and he would say `Oh,
just fix this price.' I would go to another manager, `Oh, add 50
percent, give us this price,''' said the woman, who requested
anonymity.
   She sometimes was told to raise the price as much as 100
percent, she said. ``It was my job. I had to do it.''
   An engineer at FMC told ABC the company overbilled the Army from
the beginning, sometimes tripling the price of parts.
   When production of the Bradley began in 1980, the estimated cost
of each vehicle was $548,000, according to a document issued by the
deputy chief of staff for the Army. In 1984 the cost per Bradley
was frozen by contract at $1.2 million, where it remains today.
   ABC News said FMC declined to discuss on camera their pricing
procedures for the Bradley. But, the company did provide written
answers to questions submitted over the phone, the network said.
   The company stated that ``appropriate markups are added to
parts,'' and that it does ``not condone and would not tolerate
illegal activities or actions violating fair business practices.''
   In July, the company announced that the Army had awarded it a
$289 million contract for continued production of the Bradley at
the company's plant in Santa Clara, Calif.
   Congressional, Army and FMC records show numerous mechanical and
electrical components on the vehicle have failed repeatedly in
recent years. Last December, Pentagon officials told Congress they
planned to thicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent
``more survivable'' in battle.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Pat Swindall, acting as his own attorney for
his trial next week on federal perjury charges, told a judge
Thursday during a pre-trial hearing he may put himself on the
witness stand.
   Swindall was indicted Monday on 10 counts of lying to a grand
jury during a money laundering investigation. He is being given an
expedited trial at his own request to seek a verdict before the
Nov. 8 general election in which he faces Democrat Ben Jones.
   Jury selection is to get under way Friday morning in preparation
for the trial.
   The 38-year-old, two-term Republican has said he is defending
himself because no other attorney could prepare for the case in
such a short period of time.
   Swindall told U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining there ``may
be some awkwardness should I choose to testify'' and said that with
the judge's permission he would enlist the aid of another attorney
to lead his testimony.
   The indictment stems from negotiations Swindall undertook last
year with Atlanta businessman Charles LeChasney to finance a
mortgage loan for his $1.2 million home.
   LeChasney, an acquaintance from Republican circles, introduced
him to Michael Mullaney, an undercover Internal Revenue Service
agent posing as a financier as part of a nationwide
money-laundering investigation.
   Secretly-made government tapes showed Swindall continued
pursuing the loan after being told it might be financed with
laundered drug money.
   He accepted a $150,000 check but returned it uncashed three days
later, saying he was suspicious of LeChasney's business dealings.
   The indictment charges that Swindall lied before the grand jury
in saying there were never any discussions about the possibility of
drug money involvement in the deal.

   An army colonel has been dismissed
for ordering the arrest and torture of an opposition congresssional
candidate, military officials announced Thursday.
   ``We profoundly regret the indiscretion,'' said an armed forces
communique announcing that Col. Luis Alonso Carranza had been
dismissed and replaced.
   It said that on Oct. 14, Carranza ordered about 200 soldiers to
arrest Daniel Sarmiento, a farmer and congressional candidate for
the right-wing National Party, at Sarmiento's ranch in Olancho
province near the Nicaraguan border.
   Sarmiento told authorities he was brutally beaten before being
released two days later. He said soldiers also beat several family
members and ranch employees and threatened to kill them.
   Sarmiento said he underwent intense interrogation by Carranza,
who was trying to find out if National Party presidential candidate
Rafael Leonard Callejas was involved in subsversive activities.
   Presidential and congressional elections are scheduled for
November 1989.
   The armed forces said the action against Carranza ``is a new
guarantee that we are disposed to sanction effectively those who
exceed their authority.''
   It said the military would continue its crackdown on the
``subversive cell'' in Olancho province to ``guard national
interests and Honduras' sovereignity.''

   President P.W. Botha on
Thursday threatened to add to South Africa's already extensive news
media curbs unless journalists stopped quoting ``the propaganda of
tyrants.''
   Botha, speaking at an election rally, did not elaborate on what
measures he was considering nor did he specify the ``tyrants''
involved, but it was an apparent reference to the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla group.
   He said if the media did not ``exercise self restraint'' the
government might introduce measures similar to those Britain has
placed on the Irish Republican Army. The British government on
Wednesday banned broadcast interviews with members of the outlawed
IRA and 10 other militant groups in Northern Ireland.
   Under existing media restrictions in South Africa, it is illegal
to broadcast statements by the ANC without government approval. The
state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. refers to the ANC as a
terrorist organization and does not interview its members.
   Botha spoke before a crowd of about 1,000 in Benoni, a town just
east of Johannesburg. Nationwide muncipal elections are set for
Oct. 26, and Botha's governing National Party is widely expected to
lose ground to the pro-apartheid Conservative Party.
   Botha also condemned talks between South African rugby officials
and the ANC which were held over the weekend in Harare, Zimbabwe.
   Danie Craven, the 78-year-old head of the South African Rugby
Board, said he hoped the talks would help end South Africa's
isolation in the sport. South Africa is barred from international
competition because of its apartheid policies of racial segregation.
   Botha said the ANC was trying to appear reasonable ``in order to
stab you in the back with a dagger.''
   ``There are still politically blind moles in the country who
fail to see this,'' Botha said in an apparent reference to Craven.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, wages a bombing and sabotage
campaign in its bid to oust South Africa's white-led government.

   The leftist government enacted a
30-day state of emergency Thursday that restricts civil liberties
and unauthorizes storm news, in order to prepare for a hurricane
heading toward Nicaragua.
   The announcement of the presidential decree came as Hurricane
Joan lumbered in the Caribbean with 105 mph winds more than 200
miles from the Nicaraguan coastal town of Bluefields.
   Nicaragua has been under a state of emergency for most of the
nine years that the Sandinista government has been been in control.
   The Sandinistas first imposed restrictions on civil liberties in
1982, shortly after a war with U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras
intensified. That law was revoked in January in keeping with a
Central American peace plan.
   However, the measures issued Thursday were weaker than earlier
ones that barred freedom of movement and granted police
wide-ranging powers.
   Instead, they deal mainly with the press. They prohibit all mass
media from publishing or broadcsting news on the storm unless it
was provided by the presidency or authorized sources.
   The law, signed by President Daniel Ortega, said the government
could temporarily commandeer vehicles if needed to fight the
effects of the hurricane.
   In addition, it suspends several basic constitutional freedoms,
including the right to express beliefs ``in public or private,
individually or collectively, in oral, written or any other form.''
   That move was apparently aimed at forestalling criticism of the
government's storm-relief efforts.
   Thursday's law also suspends ``the right to truthful
information.''
   The afternoon newspaper La Prensa ran a frontpage editorial
under the headline: ``An Absurd and Illegal Ban.'' Referring to the
ban on unauthorized news, it said, ``Once again the government
violates the human rights of Nicaraguans and its own Constitution.''

   A man accused of threatening the life of
Vice President George Bush was ordered held without bond Thursday
by a federal magistrate.
   David Allen Russell, 21, is a threat both to himself and others,
Magistrate Stewart Elliott ruled after a hearing in U.S. District
Court.
   Russell, was arrested early Tuesday morning at the home he
shares with his mother, Beatrice, waived his right to a preliminary
hearing and was returned to the Daviess County Detention Center.
   Russell is charged with threatening to take the life of or to
inflict bodily harm on the vice president, and sending a
threatening letter through the U.S. Postal Service following a Bush
rally in Owensboro.
   Secret Service agents testified Russell has confessed to sending
two unsigned letters to President Reagan.
   The first letter was accompanied by three pictures taken of Bush
while he spoke at English Park in Owensboro on Sept. 27.
   ``I could easily have pulled the pistol out and killed him where
he was,'' said the writer, who claimed to have a concealed
.45-caliber pistol at the rally.
   Secret Service agents said Russell has purchased as many as six
guns. Russell has never been employed and has no close friends,
agents said.
   Charges against Russell carry a maximum 25-year jail term and a
fine of up to $6,000.

<HEAD>Iranian National Charged With Illegal Weapons Exportation</HEAD>

   An Iranian national who works as a city
engineer was charged Thursday with illegally exporting a vital
component of the sophisticated surface-to-air Hawk missile to
Europe.
   Ali Reza Foyuzi Yousefi, 45, of Rock Hill allegedly tried to
ship a cathode assembly to Zurich, Switzerland, in violation of the
Arms Export Control Act, U.S. Attorney Vinton D. Lide said.
   Yousefi appeared Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Charles W.
Gambrell, who scheduled a detention hearing for Monday.
   The government will argue that Yousefi should not be granted
bail, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph R. McCrorey said. Even if
Yousefi is released on bail, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service will take him into custody, McCrorey said.
   Yousefi is an illegal alien because his work-related visa
expired in August 1986, said an affidavit signed by U.S. Customs
agent Larry Hunter.
   The affidavit said Yousfei, using the name Allen Young,
contacted Varian and Associates Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif., to seek
price quotes and repair information on sub-assemblies of a
high-tech microwave component considered a key part of the Hawk
missile's tracking and firing systems.
   According to the affidavit, ``Young's voice was recognized as
having a Persian or Middle Eastern accent. Williamson believed
Young was attempting to conceal this by simulating or `faking' a
southern accent. Young's request for information on the
sub-assemblies ... was considered by Varian officials to be
inappropriate and unusual.''
   A tip from Varian allowed an undercover agent to set up an
$89,000 deal with Yousefi, and sell him the first of 100 promised
cathode assemblies on Oct. 12, officials said.
   Yousefi went Monday to a Federal Express office at
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport in North Carolina to send a
package to Zurich, the affidavit said. Customs agents seized the
package and found the cathode, handwritten notes and two Polaroid
snapshots of a cathode, the affidavit said.
   Yousefi was arrested at his office in Rock Hill, a city of
35,000 people south of Charlotte and 77 miles north of Columbia.
   McCrorey would not comment on what country authorities thought
the cathodes were headed to. But the affidavit notes that since
1980, the United States ``has prohibited exporation of defense
articles to the countries of Iran and Iraq, in an effort to
maintain a neutral stance in the Iran-Iraq war.''
   Violation of the Arms Export Control Act carries a maximum
prison term of 10 years and a fine of up to $1 million.
   The attorneys who represented Yousefi on Thursday, Tom Roper of
Rock Hill and Jack Swerling of Columbia, did not return calls to
their offices after the hearing.

<HEAD>`The Cocktail Hour,' A Play by A.R. Gurney, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When John, a frustrated, middle-aged playwright,
asks his upper-crust parents for their permission to produce a play
he has written about them, the reaction is swift and severe.
   Dad is furious, accusing his son of ``fouling the nest.'' Mom
says write a book instead. ``It's less public,'' she sniffs.
   John's artistic effort sets in motion ``The Cocktail Hour,'' a
wise, witty and humane comedy by A.R. Gurney that examines the
often myopic relationship between parents and children.
   The play, which opened Thursday at off-Broadway's Promenade
Theater, deals with family perceptions _ how parents view their
children, how children look at their parents and how children see
each other.
   In the case of John, his parents, Bradley and Ann, and his
sister, Nina, their particular views of each other have skewered
their entire lives. John, a stand-in for Gurney, is a bit of a
misanthrope. He's jealous of a younger brother named Jigger, the
darling of both parents. Jigger is talked about but never shows up
for the big family meeting to discuss John's play.
   The family conference is held during the cocktail hour, when
upscale people gather for upscale chatter. That strange tribe known
as WASPs have provided the principal characters of nearly every
Gurney play, having been most successfully delineated in ``The
Dining Room'' and ``The Perfect Party.'' ``The Cocktail Hour''
examines them in detail, exposing their flaws but doing it with an
affection that is almost genial.
   Consider the unhappy daughter, Nina. She feels neglected,
particularly after she learns that the daughter in John's play is
only a supporting role. She says she has spent her whole life in a
supporting role, looking after her parents when what she really
wants to do is go off to Cleveland to train guide dogs for the
blind.
   If Nina feels unappreciated, John is bitter, particularly at his
father, a man he says married for money, never had to work for a
living and got where he did through the right connections of family
and friends.
   Bradley, the patriarch, rails against the loss of values, in
family and in the arts, even though his own father committed
suicide for a reason never revealed in the play.
   It's left to John and his mother to forge a new relationship,
during what is the best scene in the play. In confronting the past,
they discover an unexpected bond.
   The scene is helped immeasureably by Nancy Marchand's portrayal
of the flinty but very proper matriarch. Miss Marchand is a marvel.
Wearing sensible but elegant pumps, a flowered dress and the
requisite pearls, she is a model of efficiency, a woman who will
make do, no matter what.
   Keene Curtis doesn't quite convey the aristocractic starch that
the father should have, but his indignation at his son's public
exposure of the family's faults is real.
   Bruce Davison as the playwright son has the difficult task of
turning what could be a traitorous character into someone who
genuinely is trying to find out about his family. And he succeeds.
Holland Taylor plays the brittle sister with a style and flair for
sarcasm that ooze upper class.
   Jack O'Brien has directed the play with restraint, not pushing
the actors into the laughs but letting the comedy develop from the
situations. Steven Rubin's plush living room set sprawls across the
Promenade's wide stage, and looks appropriately expensive. But then
the whole production is first-class.
   ``The Cocktail Hour'' mixes impeccable style, a low-key charm
and some high-style performances to produce a winning concoction.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti handed over to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration nearly 3,200 pounds of cocaine worth
millions of dollars seized by Haitian authorities since June, a
U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said Thursday.
   Susan Clyde said there was no formal agreement between Haiti and
the United States on disposing of the cocaine.
   ``The Haitian authorities asked the DEA to handle the operation,
I suppose, because of its superior drug-disposal facilities,'' she
said.
   In a statement published Thursday in the newspaper Le Matin,
Col. Georges Valcin, the Port-au-Prince police chief, said the
cocaine was handed over to DEA agents Tuesday and placed on a U.S.
Coast Guard vessel ``to be destroyed far from national territory.''
   Officials said the drugs included 950 pounds of cocaine
confiscated last Saturday aboard the Greek freighter Aphormajegs
off the coast of Haiti. Walter Brown, a DEA agent based in Haiti,
said the cocaine was of high quality and would have been worth $6.5
million on the street.
   The ship's owner and eight crew members were arrested.
   Last week, the United States announced it had granted Haiti
$200,000 to buy drug-detection equipment and intensify its efforts
against trafficking through the Caribbean nation.
   The United States has said Haiti must cooperate in the fight
against illegal drugs as a condition of resuming $70 million in aid
cut off after Haiti's aborted elections in November 1987 in which
gunmen killed at least 34 voters while soldiers stood by and did
nothing.
   On Wednesday, the United States, through the embassy in
Port-au-Prince, praised the new military government of Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril ``for the seriousness with which the Haitian
government considers the problem of illegal transit of narcotics
through Haiti.''
   Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican
Republic.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix wowed the fashion crowd Thursday
in his ready-to-wear show for summer with clothes that were bright,
witty and beautiful. After a spate of so-so clothes and shows,
Lacroix's offering was like a shot in the arm for fashion.
   Color right from Lacroix's sunny south was the big news _
marvelous reds, lime, bright blues, yellow in neat boleros or long
gold-buttoned jackets dipped in the back, teamed with white or
beige pants and jumpsuits. Skirts were just above knee level or
quite long.
   Some had predicted that Lacroix could never keep up his creative
pace, but he keeps on showing his talent, this time in less zany
clothes than the little-girl frou-frous that shot him to fame.
Besides lovely linen suits or flared coats over straight pants, he
showed some good wide jumpsuit shorts and longer pants.
   The combinations of acid green, olive, coral, lipstick red,
ruddy brown and lavender were stunning.
   The sunny south was always on his mind in wonderful combinations
of Provencal prints on jersey outfits with long, full skirts, as
well as the tunic knits with Picasso or Miro motifs on them. Sheer
pullovers had Greek vase motifs and heads of bulls _ vaguely
evoking Arles in southern France and its ancient history.
   Some of the bright boleros in pink and green worn with white
pants or full black skirts had handsome, swirly embroidery, looking
like strikingly informal party or cruise wear.
   After a great line of bathing suits _ some with little skirts _
Lacroix showed a whole series of champagne dresses with guipure
lace embroidery or tucks all over.
   He ended with a big line of every kind of fluid black or navy
cocktail dress imaginable. And there was not a pouf in sight by the
man who started them, unless one considers a puffy organza number
worn as a funny grace note to the show.
   Kenzo's offering was sunny too, though more sedate than his
usual show in a circus building. This time he showed in his
Left-bank shop. Just for fun he showed cotton tail-coats with
shorts, but his long and colorful linen suits with cropped trousers
or narrow skirts with a kick pleat in the back were serious fashion.
   He picked on the French Revolution bicentenary coming up to
highlight his show. The striped lean pants, tiered skirts and
revolutionary stocking caps came out in red, white and French blue.
   Besides cute suits with full short skirts, he showed long ivory
suits with jackets opened like a tulip shape over a panel
underneath, he got some costumey inspiration as well. Tiered Gypsy
dresses and zodiac-printed numbers had enough fantasy for any beach
party.
   And the beachcomber could do no better than the tropical leaf
and exotic bird prints on shorts, billowy sheer tops and shortie
beach cover-ups.
   Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons has taken to showing wearable
clothes _ especially if you like full short culottes or bloomers.
With some nice harlequin-diamond or square black and white sheer
tops, the clothes had more symmetry than usual.
   The prettiest numbers were the filmy, shiny and sheer muslins or
organzas billowing in pastel layers of tops, overskirts and pants.
   Yohji Yamamoto showed enough black suits for an undertaker. But
his excellent and easy cut in the pants suits, jumpers and longer
dresses had a certain austere style.
   ``It's very wearable, handsome, and elegant _ my favorite
collection so far,'' said Selma Weiser, owner of Charivari, a store
with several branches in New York.
   Some of the dresses in light crepe with dropped-waist,
ballooning tiered effects with pastel shoulder wraps were
attractive under their Edwardian hats. And the trapeze dresses had
poor-girl chic, though they aren't budget numbers.
   For welcome color, Yamamoto showed saffron and rust
paisley-print full-skirted trench coats and suits with outsized
jackets and wide pants.
   Nino Cerruti's show had plenty of grown-up charm in narrow pants
suits, long or short skirts, and full shorts. A series of pinks and
beiges in silk and linen was based on fluid pyjamas, fitted jackets
with ribbed or welt seaming, a few loose duster jackets.
   The colors were mostly based on sand and navy, with some
remarkable dark silk flower-printed, flowing culottes worn with
tailored short jackets, a dinner suit for summer.
   Cerruti's prettiest summer late-day clothes were the long pants
or short white linen skirts generously edged in wide bands of
eyelet.
   Thierry Mugler is still enamored of too-tight clothes and
vampires. His show was something between a sci-fi TV miniseries and
a trip to Dracula's den. The spacewomen came out in slick jumpsuits
with crescent-shaped tucks all over or in complicated draped
dresses.
   His bright blue or turquoise suits had jeweled vampire-pointed
fronts on the jacket, clinging skirts. Vinyl details all over
included see-through plastic bustier bodices over sequined
iridescent miniskirts for a mermaid effect.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Bush Campaign Like Nixon; New Police Backing for Bush</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS six grafs after 10th pvs, In an..., to UPDATE with Al
Smith dinner; EDITS to tighten.

   Michael Dukakis compared George Bush's campaign to the Watergate
scandal of Richard Nixon on Thursday, saying ``truth was the first
casualty'' in both instances. Bush received new police endorsements
along with the badge of a slain officer in New York.
   The Democratic governor and the Republican vice president dueled
from a distance on the campaign trail before sheathing their
political swords and dining together at the annual, nonpartisan
Alfred E. Smith charity dinner in Manhattan, sponsored by the Roman
Catholic archdiocese of New York.
   Dukakis, urged by supporters to get tough in the face of polls
that show him trailing Bush, did just that during an appearance in
New Haven, Conn.
   ``Truth was the first casualty in the Nixon White House and it
was the first casualty in the Bush campaign,'' Dukakis said.
``Above all, the truth should matter a lot in a presidential
campaign because as we learned in Watergate, it matters a lot in
the Oval Office.''
   ``I believe the American people value the truth in politics and
I'm going to do everything I can to make sure truth wins and that
we win on the Eighth of November,'' the Democratic nominee said.
   Dukakis also made a point of drawing a distinction with Bush on
the emotionally charged subject of abortion.
   ``George Bush wants the government to make one of the most
personal choices a woman can make. ... I believe a choice that
personal must be made by the woman herself.''
   In almost every speech he makes, Bush says he opposes almost all
abortions while Dukakis does not.
   In an odd episode in an already negative campaign, Dukakis'
national field director resigned Thursday after saying Bush should
``fess up'' about a rumor that rippled through Wall Street on
Wednesday.
   The remarks by Donna Brazile to reporters also led Dukakis to
apologize directly to Bush in New York.
   At the Al Smith dinner, Dukakis spoke first and got in a few
jibes at Bush as well as some self-deprecating digs at himself.
   He began by saying how pleased he to be at an event where ``all
thought of politics is banished and I can concentrate on what I do
best _ comedy.''
   Dukakis apologized for the fact his wife's absence.
   ``Kitty's in a hotel room in Dallas tonight,'' he said. ``Maybe
she qualifies as a Texan,'' a dig at the fact Bush's Texas
residence is a hotel room in Houston.
   Bush joked about his background. He noted Dukakis' pride in his
immigrant roots, and said: ``My people landed at Ellis Island. They
were on the Mayflower when it made a pit stop on the way to
Plymouth.
   ``You've seen the portraits of the Mayflower. My people are the
ones waving the Bloomingdales shopping bags.''
   Dukakis was greeted Thursday by news of a poll saying he is 10
points behind Bush in Connecticut, a state that borders his home
base of Massachusetts. ``You know the polls,'' Dukakis commented.
``They go up and down.''
   Bush, campaigning in a state once considered a stronghold for
Dukakis, traveled to the New York City borough of Queens to receive
police endorsements and to campaign in a Democratic neighborhood.
   Along with the badge of slain officer Edward Byrne came the
endorsement of about 30 police organizations, including the
40,000-member Police Benevolent Association of New York.
   ``It's time for America to take back the streets,'' Bush said,
calling the new police backing ``an exclamation point'' for his
campaign. Both he and Dukakis have made much of endorsements from
law-enforcement organizations during a campaign in which Bush has
sought to portray Dukakis as soft on crime.
   The vice president spoke at a high school in Queens, not far
from where officer Byrne was shot last February in his car while
guarding a witness in a drug case.
   The slain officer's father, Matthew Byrne, a retired New York
police lieutenant, said he was giving Bush his son's shield and
commendation bar ``because we believe he and his administration
will stand up for us.''
   Rich Bond, Bush's political director, contended that Dukakis'
political base is cracking. Bond called New York ``the jewel in his
base, and it's shaky for him.''
   At his first stop of the day, Bush addressed 600 supporters in a
Knights of Columbus hall in South River, N.J., and cautioned
against relaxing the nation's military strength because of peace
overtures from Moscow.
   ``I don't think we should risk turning over the leadership and
security of this free world of ours to a man ... with literally no
experience in foreign affairs,'' the vice president added.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis' running mate, said he
was giving himself the job of answering GOP charges. ``Every time
they issue a falsehood, I'm going to take them on and straighten
that one out,'' he told workers at the huge General Electric
appliance plant in Louisville, Ky.
   Bentsen, a World War II veteran, said he took it ``as a personal
insult to me'' that the Republicans were trying to paint Dukakis as
weak on defense.
   In neighboring Ohio, Sen. Dan Quayle, who is Bush's running
mate, said the economic recovery generated during the Reagan-Bush
administration means ``a job for all who want to work. It means for
the first time ever we can make and keep the promise of a job for
every American who wants a job.''
   GOP aides said polls in Ohio show Bush with a narrow lead in the
hotly competitive state. President Reagan campaigned in Ohio on
Wednesday and Bush will be there Friday.
   In another development, Jesse Jackson gave a pep talk in
Washington to House Democrats, urging them to campaign vigorously
for Dukakis when Congress adjourns.
   ``Governor Dukakis supplies the priorities; we can supply the
passion,'' Jackson said.

   France will host a conference to support
the international ban on chemical weapons, and officials hope Iraq
will attend, a French disarmament specialist said Thursday.
   President Reagan last month proposed such a conference.
   Widespread and documented use of chemical weapons by Iraq
against Iran and reports of their use against Iraqi Kurds has
highlighted the issue of poison gas. The United Nations has
condemned Iraq's use of the illegal weapons, which the Baghdad
government has acknowledged.
   Ambassador Pierre Morel, a French envoy to a U.N. disarmament
committee, told reporters that the conference would be Jan. 7-11.
   ``We hope all the signatories to the (1925 Geneva Convention)
banning chemical weapons will attend, and Iraq is a signatory,''
Morel said. One-hundred and ten countries have signed the
convention.
   He also said the nations which had not signed the pact,
numbering about 50, would be welcome.
   Morel said the Paris conference would reinforce discussions in
Geneva aimed at establishing a universal ban on the weapons.

<TEXT>
   Swarms of pink locusts, possibly
blown thousands of miles from Africa by tropical storms, have
invaded at least 12 Caribbean nations, and officials say they
endanger sugar and corn crops.
   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has sent experts to
the islands to help in eradication, Frederick Zenny, the FAO
regional head in Barbados, said Thursday.
   Locusts, rarely seen in the Caribbean, are migratory
grasshoppers that often travel in vast swarms and strip areas they
pass of all vegetation. Because locusts feed on grass, the two
major grass crops in the region _ sugarcane and corn _ are most in
danger.
   Zenny said the locusts could be part of a swarm the FAO has been
tracking since early October. Officials say the insects pose no
danger to people.
   ``We had been tracking a swarm earlier this month that had blown
off course from Africa towards the Cape Verde islands and we have
tracked this swarm to about 1,500 miles away from French Guiana in
South America,'' he said.
   Since Tropical Storm Joan, now a hurricane, swept through the
eastern Caribbean last week, the locusts have been sighted in
Barbados, St. Vincent, Antigua, St. Lucia, Dominica, Trinidad,
Grenada, Guyana, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the
French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe.
   Agricultural experts in Guyana, Grenada and Barbados said they
suspected the locusts were blown in from Africa by Joan and other
tropical storms this season.
   However, Dominica's Agriculture Ministry issued a report saying,
``This may not be an African species of locusts, but South or
Central American.''
   Dr. David Nellis of the Virgin Islands Department of Planning
and Natural Resources said the locusts probably came from northern
South America.
   ``The locust is 3 inches long, has speckled wing covers and
salmon pink legs,'' Nellis said.
   Chris Seiler, a Virgin Islands resident, said the locusts are
the same as those that helped destroy agriculture in his native
Ethiopia. He said the only means of prevention is to chemically
spray where the locusts are expected to hit next.
   In Guyana, on South America's northern coast, the government
asked farmers to report any locust sightings to the police or
Agriculture Ministry, saying the insects _ never seen before in
Guyana _ could wipe out crops.
   ``We are asking anyone who notices the creatures ... to notify
authorities immediately,'' said an Agriculture Ministry statement
read over government radio. ``They are dangerous to agriculture.''
   ``If what we fear is true, there is a serious threat to the
agricultural industry,'' said a ministry spokesman.
   The Dominica government's chief agricultural adviser, Colin
Bully, said no reports of crop damage have surfaced so far.
   The ministry said three field survey teams are covering Dominica
to assess the density of locusts and will issue a report on
possible crop damage.
   Barbados mounted an islandwide survey and planned a massive
spraying campaign for Saturday and Sunday.
   Agricultural officials in have set up three hot lines for
farmers and residents to report sightings.

<HEAD>Four Protestant Gunmen Sentenced To Life For Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four young Protestant activists
were sentenced to life in prison at Belfast Crown Court Thursday
for the murders of two Roman Catholics and a fellow Protestant
activist last year.
   The four _ Darren Larmour, 22, Robert Molyneaux, 20, Alfred
Howcroft, 20, and Joseph Morrison, 23 _ are all members of the
paramilitary Ulster Defense Association.
   In passing sentence, Judge James Nicholson said Catholics should
appreciate the determination of the police in combating such crimes
by Protestant extremists.
   Nicholson said the legal Ulster Defense Association, formed in
1971 as an umbrella organization for Protestant vigilante groups,
was comparable to the outlawed, mainly Catholic Irish Republican
Army.
   He said the two Catholics, Edward Campbell and James Meighan,
were killed simply because of their religion and the Ulster Defense
Association man, Thomas Dickson, was killed because he was disliked.
   Had it not been for the determination of the police, the
killings would have gone unsolved, Nicholson said.
   ``But for their (police) efforts Catholics in north Belfast
would be in greater danger than they are now. Many of the relatives
and friends of the deceased must be aware that the police, and only
the police, could solve these murders,'' the judge said.
   Many Catholics in Northern Ireland are wary of the province's
predominantly Protestant police force, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
   Larmour pleaded guilty to murdering Campbell and Dickson.
Molyneaux and Howcroft each pleaded guilty to murdering Campbell
and Meighan. Morrison pleaded guilty to murdering Meighan and
Dickson.
   The Ulster Defense Association claims 18,000 members. The Ulster
Freedom Fighters, said to be the Association's military wing, is
outlawed.
   The British government on Wednesday banned television and radio
interviews with the Ulster Defense Association, the Ulster Freedom
Fighters, the IRA and eight other groups from both sides of
Northern Ireland's sectarian divide in a bid to deny guerrillas a
propaganda platform.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Protestant-dominated
Northern Ireland and unite it with the 95-percent Catholic Republic
of Ireland under socialist rule. Protestant militants oppose any
suggestion of uniting the province with Ireland.

   A volunteer firefighter and a rescue
squad member were charged Thursday with attempted murder for
allegedly throwing cinder blocks on cars from highway overpasses.
   Michael Havekost, 18, of Warren Township, a member of the
Millington Rescue Squad and Passaic First Aid Squad, and David
Domanski, 25, of Passaic Township, a member of the Millington
Volunteer Fire Department, each were charged Thursday with six
counts of attempted murder in Somerset County Superior Court.
   They were held in the Somerville County jail in lieu of $150,000
bail.
   ``They were creating their own incidents to make themselves
heroes,'' Trooper Daniel Cosgrove said. ``They were getting a kick
out it this. It's kind of sick to do it.''
   Cosgrove said witnesses reported that after each block-throwing
incident, a black sports car would appear on the scene to offer aid.
   ``It turns out Mr. Domanski owns a 1988 Pontiac Firebird similar
to the car described by witnesses at these incidents,'' he said.
   The two were charged with incidents along Route 78 on Sept. 19,
24 and 26. Three people were hurt in the incidents.
   Cosgrove said the two were arrested by Passaic police last week
on arson charges and released. During questioning in Passaic, one
of the suspects mentioned the cinder block incidents and state
troopers were called in, he said.
   Cosgrove said it was not immediately clear why they were
released after they were linked to the cinder block-throwing
incident.

   First Lady Nancy Reagan, wearing one of her
trademark designer gowns, was honored by service clubs and other
organizations Thursday night for her ``Just Say No'' campaign
against drug abuse.
   Speaking at the conclusion of a testimonial dinner in her honor,
the first lady said, ``I think my work against drug abuse has
provided me with the most fulfilling years of my life.''
   President Reagan accompanied his wife to the dinner, but did not
speak.
   None of the speakers referred to the controversy that has dogged
Mrs. Reagan since it was disclosed this week that she has continued
to borrow designer clothing despite a 1982 promise to discontinue
the practice.
   The first lady's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said the
glittering sequined gown Mrs. Reagan wore was from Adolfo, one of
her favorite designers. Mrs. Crispen did not say whether Mrs.
Reagan bought the gown or borrowed it.
   The Los Angeles-based designer said earlier this week that he
customarily loans Mrs. Reagan his gowns, rather than selling them
to her.
   Before the testimonial dinner, Mrs. Reagan was presented at a
private reception with the Colombian congressional order of the
Great Extraordinary Cross with Gold Star in recognition of her work
with young people in drug prevention programs.
   The award was presented by Amilcar Lopez Lopez, president of the
Colombian Senate.
   An unannounced speaker at the testimonial dinner was comedian
Bob Hope, who joined in tributes to Mrs. Reagan and added some
political humor.
   Of Vice President George Bush, Hope said, ``In the last debate,
he was so much better than usual that they tested him for
steroids.''
   Of Bush's controversial running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, Hope said, ``I don't think there's anything wrong with
sending a Quayle to Washington; after all, we send enough turkeys.''
   Host organizations for the dinner included Kiwanis, Rotary,
Lions, Optimist, Sertoma and Exchange clubs, joined by more than 30
national young groups, fraternal and social organizations and
agencies dealing with school-age drug and alcohol abuse.

   The Food and Drug Administration is hoping to
speed therapies for AIDS and other life-threatening diseases to
market by formally encouraging pharmaceutical companies to work
with the agency in the earliest stages of drug development.
   In announcing publication of the new regulations in the Federal
Register on Wednesday, FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young acknowledged
that they essentially ``codify'' what the agency already is doing.
   The Federal Register notice itself says that ``although the
(new) program is important, it builds upon managerial and
regulatory options available under existing practices and
procedures.''
   Young said the new mechanism _ which essentially allows a drug
company to bypass final-stage drug testing _ was similar to that
used in approval last year of AZT, still the only recognized drug
for treatment of AIDS.

   The ``greenhouse effect'' warming the Earth is
likely to raise ocean levels but lower the Great Lakes, reduce
crops across the South and turn some northern forests into
grasslands, according to a major government study.
   The unreleased report by the Environmental Protection Agency
says low-lying coastal areas equal in size to the state of
Massachusetts could be submerged.
   Congress directed EPA to perform major studies on the effects of
the greenhouse effect and what can be done about it. Both studies
are expected to be submitted to Congress in December. A draft of
the summary of the effects report was obtained Wednesday by The
Associated Press.
   The ``greenhouse effect'' is the expected warming of the Earth
from the growing concentration of gases in the atmosphere that keep
heat from being radiated out to space. The principal greenhouse
gas, carbon dioxide, has increased 10 percent since 1958 and
continued worldwide use of fossil fuels and destruction of tropical
rain forests point to further increases.

   While too little iron in the body is clearly a
health hazard, a study published today suggests that too much of
the essential nutrient also may be bad, possibly increasing the
risk of cancer.
   The study found that men with high levels of iron in their
bodies are more likely to have cancer of the colon, lungs, bladder
and esophagus, suggesting that the widespread habit of
supplementing the diet with iron may not be in the best interests
of people who are already getting enough.
   ``People have long studied the consequences of iron
deficiency,'' commented Dr. Katherine McGlynn of the Fox Chase
Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ``It's only recently that people
have studied iron overloading and raised the possibility that we
have gone overboard in fortifying all the food in sight.''
   The latest study was directed by Dr. Richard G. Stevens of
Batelle, Pacific Northwest Laboratories in Richland, Wash., and
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

   Some television stations would have to reduce
advertising and refocus their children's programming efforts under
a bill approved by Congress and hailed as ``a victory for America's
children.''
   The measure won final passage on a voice vote in the Senate on
Wednesday, but the Reagan administration opposes it and the Justice
Department recommends that he veto it on constitutional grounds.
   The measure would limit advertising time during children's shows
and require TV stations to provide informative programming for
children as a condition of license renewal.
   Supporters say the legislation is the most important statement
by Congress on children's television in a generation.

   A Reagan administration official who refused
to fund a school study program on the Holocaust acknowledges that
her decision was based in part on reviews including one complaining
that the views of Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan weren't included.
   Supporters of the Holocaust program entitled ``Facing History
and Ourselves'' contend that the review boards set up to assess the
merits of the program for the Education Department were
ideologically slanted and predisposed to recommend it not be funded.
   But Shirley Curry, a political appointee in the department, said
criticism that ``somehow the department in general and I in
particular have operated in some anti-Semitic mode ... is
absolutely absurd.''
   She told a House Government Operations subcommittee Wednesday
that the program was denied $70,000 in federal funds three times.
Those decisions were made either because the program scored low in
critiques prepared by panels of outside reviewers or because, as
was the case this year when the program received a relatively high
score, a money squeeze prevented funding of an entire category of
programs.

<HEAD>Lovable Smurfs Now 30 Years Old</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smurfs, the lovable blue gnomes with
four fingers and a special language, were born in 1958 when a
preoccupied cartoonist called Peyo asked a friend to pass the salt
but said ``schtroumpf'' instead.
   Three decades after they appeared as minor characters in a
Belgian series on knights and kings, they are among the world's
favorite cartoon characters.
   Their adventures have been told in 13 books translated into 25
languages. They have appeared in 250 Smurf television programs and
four feature-length movies.
   A Smurf is a Pitufo in Spanish, the original Schtroumpf in
French, a Schlumpf in German and Smolf in Danish. Italians call
them Puffos and to the Japanese they are Sumafus. A Smurf is a Nam
Ching Ling to the Chinese and the Hebrew word is Dardassim.
   All this has brought fame and fortune to Peyo, who in real life
is Pierre Culliford, a 60-year-old native of Brussels who now lives
in Switzerland.
   He is grateful and threw a Smurfday party Oct. 16 in the Belgian
capital's historic Grand Place square, attended by about 5,000
children and adults.
   ``I feel a bit groggy,'' he said, looking out at the crowd.
   The party featured a giant cake, drawing contests, puppet shows,
a magician and replicas of the Smurfs' toadstool homes, in a
setting of some of the finest Gothic and baroque architecture in
Europe.
   Culliford's slip of the tongue in 1958 created an industry.
Smurfs now appear on 2,000 consumer products around the world, from
writing gear to mugs, knapsacks to sweatshirts, spaghetti packages
and yogurt jars to petroleum products.
   Unauthorized uses have included an appearance on the sides of
water cannon trucks used by Panamanian security forces.
   ``We know about that from a Belgian television crew that was
filming in Panama, but we have not authorized the Smurfs to be used
in that form,'' said Nadine Peeters of IMPS, the Brussels agency
that approves commercial use of the Smurfs.
   The cuddly Culliford creations use the word `smurf' both as verb
and noun in a language that can be confusing but at times is rich
in poetic harmony.
   Educators once scorned the strange tongue, which children
usually understand better than adults, but it gradually won
acceptance and even appears in an official Dutch dictionary.
   ``Early on, parents complained because their kids started to
talk `smurfish','' Peyo said at the giant birthday party, but now
he is planning a 60-acre Smurf entertainment park near Metz,
France, a Smurf monthly magazine and a 14th book, about an
ambitious Smurf who wants to open a bank.
   Much of the Smurf surge of recent years is attributable to their
appearance on television and development of the U.S. market.
   When Peyo spent that evening with a fellow cartoonist at seaside
restaurant 30 years ago, he was drawing ``Johan and Pirlouit,'' a
cartoon series set in the Middle Ages.
   He wanted to introduce gnomes, of which he was fond, ``but most
of them are too scary or immoral to feature in cartoons for kids.''
   The dinner-table gaffe gave him the Smurfs, with their funny
language, and they caught on quickly.
   First came their own strip, then books, and in 1975 the first
Smurf movie, ``The Flute with the Six Smurfs.''
   Plastic and stuffed Smurfs reached the United States in 1978.
Four years later, an estimated 9 million youngsters were watching
them on Saturday morning television.
   Culliford-Peyo gives this explanation of their success: ``The
Smurfs do not fit into any category, Every culture can absorb the
Smurfs because the Smurfs do not belong to any culture. Everybody
understands the blue gnomes.''

   Comedy is serious business at $13.95 a copy,
babe.
   And so comedian Richard Belzer, sitting in the Frank Sinatra
Room of the show biz haven The Friars Club, keeps a straight face
while discussing his first tome, ``How to Be a Stand Up Comic.''
   ``Why a book? Well, no one had ever written one. And a lot of
people have always asked me a lot of questions, been curious about
it, and I was surprised to see that nobody had written an insider's
view,'' he said.
   Yeah, but is the book a joke? Or does it have some real pointers?
   ``There are things in there that are very useful,'' offers a
still-somber Belz, whose live shows have made him the favorite
comic of (among others) Robin Williams. ``Having seen hundreds of
people try to be comedians over the years, I've learned some
insights that I've relayed in the book.''
   For example, there are tips on handling hecklers: ``What do you
use for birth control _ your personality?''
   There are tips on jokes to avoid: ``Never, never, ever make fun
of Frank Sinatra. Dead comics tell no jokes, if you get my drift.''
   And there are tips on slipping funny country names into your
stand-up: ``Cameroon, Lichtenstein, Canada, Lapland and, of course,
Sri Lanka.''
   Belzer, who declined to give his age, was born in Bridgeport,
Conn. He did not complete college, and claims he was asked to leave
because of his ``uncontrollable wit.''
   He has never written any previous books, but has appeared in
several movies, including ``Night Shift'' with Michael Keaton, and
``Scarface'' with Al Pacino. He also was co-host of a morning radio
show, a cable TV show ``Hot Properties'' and appeared off-Broadway
in ``The National Lampoon Show.'' He lives with his wife and two
daughters in Manhattan.
   Belzer started performing as a stand-up comic in 1972: ``I'd
done everything else in my life. I was a teacher, I was a census
taker, a jewelry salesman. I was a free-lance writer.
   ``And finally, I just wound up saying, `Well, I've been funny
all my life, let me try and make a living at what I should be
making a living at.''
   In his first two times onstage, he experienced the high and the
low of the business.
   ``The very first time I was on stage, I was at `The Escape
Hatch' in New Jersey _ that's where I killed,'' he recalled.
``First time I ever performed, for some reason, I just did great.
And then I bombed at Max's Kansas City.''
   Since then, it's been mostly highs for Belzer, who lists his
favorite comics _ Albert Brooks, Richard Lewis, Jay Leno, Gilbert
Gottfried _ but refuses to name those he finds unfunny.
   ``Can you imagine if I gave you one name?'' said Belzer, finally
breaking into a smile. ``It would reverberate through the echoes of
the industry.''
   After loosening up a bit, the comic then provided a Belz-eye's
view of several public figures.
   _ Preacher-patron Jimmy Swaggart: ``I think he's proved you can
apologize to anything and get away with it, 'cause he apologized to
his son, his wife, his car, aluminum. He sinned against everything.
So he set the world record for apologies.
   _ President Ronald Reagan: ``Well, I'm going to miss Ronald
Reagan. But he's not gone yet. We may be in Nicaragua sooner than
you think.''
   _ Mayor Edward I. Koch: ``I think he's a self-serving,
demagogic, megalomaniacal fool, with one of the most corrupt
administrations in the history of the city. But aside from that,
he's doing a good job.''
   Finished here, a serious Belzer goes back to the serious
business of promoting his book and providing advice to the aspiring
laugh-getter.
   ``Don't give up too early, 'cause it's very hard. It's
discouraging, but if you really want to do it, it's great,'' he
said. ``I mean, it's great if you can make a living at being a
comedian. It's a wonderful thing.''

<HEAD>Japan Shoring Up Two Rocks to Preserve Sea Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   So what if two tiny, faraway rocks crumble or sink
into the Pacific? Japan might lose fishing and mining rights to
155,000 square miles of ocean, that's what, so it is spending about
$236 million to shore them up.
   The rocks called North Dew and East Dew, each barely large
enough for a person to sleep on, are Japan's southernmost points
and hold the key to treasure in this age of national
economic-control zones extending 200 miles from shore.
   Since April, about 200 workers using helicopters and
ship-mounted cranes have surrounded them with thousands of
four-pointed steel blocks, like anchors. The blocks form protective
circles 165 feet in diameter on a coral reef about 10 feet below
the surface 1,100 miles south of Tokyo.
   Haruo Aoki of the Construction Ministry's coastal department
said the work has cost 17 billion yen ($134 million) so far and
total is expected to be 30 billion yen. He said the circles will be
filled with concrete, beginning next year.
   At high tide, the rocks extend 3 to 10 feet above sea level. If
the tide should cover them, the reef no longer could be defined as
an island and Japan no longer could claim a 200-mile economic zone
around it.
   That means the nation's southermost point would move about 300
miles north, between the Volcano Islands on the east and the
Yaeyama Islands.
   North Dew and East Dew are about a mile apart on the reef, which
was an island called Parece Vela when it appeared on 17th century
Spanish navigation charts.
   The Japanese call it Okinotorishima (Remote Bird Island) and
official records say it was put under Tokyo's jurisdiction in 1931.
It is recognized as Japanese in the World War II peace treaty.
   Japan declared a 200-mile exclusive economic zone around the
reef in 1977, following the international trend to such areas of
control.
   Both rocks are shaped like mushrooms with thin stems attached to
the submerged reef, which is about three miles square. North Dew is
about 15{ feet in diameter and East Dew just over half that size.
   Agriculture Ministry figures say 2,577 tons of bonito, tuna and
other fish were caught in the 200-mile zone around them in 1985,
the last year for which figures are available. The catch was worth
$7 million at the current rate of exchange.
   No signs of oil have been reported but surveys are continuing to
determine whether mining of cobalt, nickel and other metals would
be feasible on the undersea mountain capped by the reef, said
Motohiko Kato of the International Trade and Industry Ministry's
National Resources and Energy Agency.
   The mountain rises 16,400 to 19,700 feet from the ocean floor.
   No estimate has been made of how much Japan would lose if the
rocks slipped below the surface and the area around Okinotorishima
became international, an Agriculture Ministry official said.

<HEAD>Canadian Hopes to Reach Children with Animated Film on AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartoon movies are a universal hit with
youngsters, Peter Dalglish reasoned, so that should be the best way
to teach street kids of the world the perils of AIDS.
   The Canadian youth worker's short animated film ``Survivors'' is
being made on a budget of $500,000 ($415,000 U.S.) by the National
Film Board of Canada, whose award-winning experience with animation
dates back nearly five decades.
   It should be ready for distribution in 20 languages by the time
more than 10,000 health workers and other experts gather in
Montreal next June for the fifth international conference on AIDS,
for which no cure has been found.
   ``We're trying to reach kids in the 30 largest cities of the
developing world,'' Dalglish, 31, said in an interview. ``It's a
film for the front lines. I think we're two or three years ahead of
the game.''
   A preliminary version of the cartoon, without music or full
animation, has been tested on young audiences in the Philippines,
Kenya, Sri Lanka, Brazil and New York.
   ``We saw very strong identification with the characters,''
Dalglish said. ``The story tested extremely well.''
   Dalglish went to Africa after finishing law school and in
Khartoum, Sudan, founded Street Kids International, which forms
bicycle courier services to provide jobs. It now employs 20
children at any given time and is planning expansion to other
cities with capital raised in Canada.
   ``You have to be able to provide an alternative to
prostitution,'' Dalglish said. ``Given a choice, they'll all choose
riding a bicycle over sleeping with someone.''
   In Khartoum, he became increasingly concerned about the
potential for disaster as AIDS becomes a disease concentrated among
the urban poor.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Canada has reported more than 2,000 AIDS cases and estimates for
1992 run up to 12,000, but the scene of ``Survivors'' is
specifically Third World, depicting children picking pockets or
turning to prostitution.
   No reliable estimates are available of how prevalent AIDS has
become among street children, who may number 40 million throughout
the world, but Dalglish said the prevalence of other sexually
transmitted diseases might make the projections pessimistic.
   He said the idea of an animated film was born in Khartoum when
he borrowed a projector from the U.S. Embassy to show his
youngsters a Tom and Jerry cartoon, and ``for the first time that
anyone could remember we had the complete attention of every kid in
the room.''
   ``Survivors'' is intended for showing to small groups of
children aged 6 to 14 with a youth worker present to lead a
discussion afterward.
   ``It makes it easy for kids to talk about AIDS, about health,
with street workers,'' Dalglish said. ``We could be subtle, while
being reasonably explicit at the same time.''
   He hopes to raise funds for accompanying instruction guides and
comic books.
   Dalglish and the production team went to Mexico and Guatemala so
the animators could get to know their audience and create an
authentic atmosphere, but the setting is intentionally vague in
order to broaden the film's appeal.
   Even New York street kids were intrigued by it, Dalglish said,
but ``Survivors'' is not really intended for those raised on
Saturday morning cartoons.
   The Canadian hopes explicit language in the film and instruction
about the use of condoms will not create barriers to its
distribution.
   ``We are recognizing the reality that exists in the street and
responding to it,'' he said. ``The kids see it as a moral film.''

<HEAD>British Publishing Wrestles with the Age of the Big Buck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The genteel world of British publishing is
awakening to the age of the conglomerate and wrestling with the
question of whether books can be sold like bars of soap.
   ``Publishing has become a pitiless world, the stuff of boardroom
battles and heart-rending drama. No place for gentlemen,'' writes
Margaret Pringle in The Independent newspaper.
   ``Publishing was very much a cottage industry here. It's now a
business,'' says Joanna Goldsworthy, a publishing director at
prestigious Victor Gollancz. ``Business people forget that without
authors, they're nothing.''
   Such comments have sparked a heated debate about the place of
corporations, especially American ones, in British publishing,
where dreamy images of a gaslighted Dickensian era linger.
   The big guns deny they are cheapening literature, and few top
authors are complaining about the vastly fatter advances being
offered.
   ``You can find a Dickensian publisher, (but) no one wants to,''
observes London-based American agent Ed Victor. ``It's no good
looking back and being wistful. The old days are gone. You're not
going to go out and buy a Remington typewriter when you can buy a
word processor.''
   The trend toward conglomerates has encouraged some small quality
imprints to take wing, rather as a neighborhood supermarket will
spawn high-quality delicatessens around it.
   ``Were the good old days really all that good?'' said Ian
Chapman, chairman of Collins Publishers, one of Britain's most
acquisitive houses.
   ``Conditions of employment, wages, and salaries were
appalling,'' he said at a recent publishers' seminar.
   ``Since the mid-'70s, we've had to look to our laurels and
become much more professional. We're having to recognize that books
should make a return on investment ... (but) they can still have
the same love and care,'' he said.
   There's no shortage of books. In 1987, 59,837 titles were
published in Britain, compared to 36,322 a decade before. But the
increase is in output rather than quality _ hobby and special
interest books rather than in exciting new fiction.
   Meanwhile, the gentleman publisher is becoming a thing of the
past.
   In February 1986, Macmillan in Britain bought the small British
house of Sidgwick and Jackson for 1.75 million pounds (about $2.5
million). One year later, Random House bought the publishing
consortium CVBC for 17.5 million pounds (about $31 million).
   That purchase ended the independence of four noted British
imprints _ Chatto and Windus, Virago, Bodley Head and Jonathan Cape
_ and gave Random House a long-sought British foothold. Virago,
which specializes in feminist literature, bought its way out six
months later and is now 90-percent independent.
   Takeover fever is not exclusively American. Over the past four
years, British-owned Octopus has purchased Methuen, Secker and
Warburg and Heinemann, three London houses esteemed for their
independence and the attention they lavished on their authors.
   British publisher Robert Maxwell has bid unsuccessfully for
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and is now trying to buy Macmillan in the
United States. The two Macmillans have common ancestry but are now
separate companies.
   Meanwhile, the prices paid for books have skyrocketed. Chatto
and Windus bought Michael Holroyd's three-volume biography of
George Bernard Shaw for 625,000 pounds (about $1 million). Novelist
Salman Rushdie left Jonathan Cape for Viking Penguin and a two-book
deal reported at 850,000 pounds (about $1.43 million).
   Penguin, a pioneer of British paperbacks, has also become an
important publishing outlet in the United States.
   Bookshops reflect the changing status in the business. Sleek
chain stores with shopping carts and glaring lights are supplanting
those quiet, musty, idiosyncratic establishments of ``84 Charing
Cross Road,'' where one could browse and lose oneself for an entire
day.
   If literature now represents lucre, some are wondering at what
price.
   ``Authors at the moment are getting rather a raw deal,'' said
Gollancz's Goldsworthy. ``Publishing is becoming so much more of a
business ... (that) publishers are forgetting at their peril that
they need authors.''
   Novelist Malcolm Bradbury agreed that practices had changed
since his first novel, ``Eating People Is Wrong,'' appeared in 1959.
   ``I'm worried,'' the author said in an interview. ``These
changes in ownership may result in remote companies whose prime
interest is not in publishing, but in publishing balance sheets.
   ``The danger will be if we reach a point where commercial
pressures become so intense that publishers can only afford to go
with books that can sell in very large quantities.''
   Octopus' purchase of Secker and Warburg, the imprint that gave
Britain George Orwell, Thomas Mann and Italo Calvino, prompted an
anguished open letter from literary agent Giles Gordon to Punch
Magazine.
   ``Most of our significant literary houses are now shackled and
restricted in the hands of managers, bureaucracies, corporate
strategies,'' Gordon wrote. ``Your shareholders may be pleased. We
readers are appalled. ... I beseech you, think it possible you may
be mistaken.''
   Calls to Octopus for comment were not returned.
   Anthony Burgess, author of ``A Clockwork Orange,'' argued in The
Observer that the United States had set the precedent, and he saw a
dilemma for authors.
   ``The impersonality of the whole proceeding is mitigated, for
the author, by money. But money, strangely enough, cannot easily
compensate for the author's sense of being reduced to a commodity
like soap or peanut butter,'' he wrote.
   Bradbury said that whatever the problems, the changes have
advantages.
   ``The greater commercialization in the system has improved
book-selling no end,'' he said. ``More books are bought, and newish
writers are acquiring audiences through this distribution system at
a far greater speed than they would have done when I started
writing.''
   Meanwhile, bucking the prevailing trend are a few new publishing
houses seeking to fill the void created by the takeovers.
   In September 1986, Nigel Newton launched Bloomsbury Press with 2
million pounds (then about $3 million) in capital, saying the surge
in conglomerates spurred him on.
   Newton said Bloomsbury offered authors a tailor-made service
increasingly unavailable elsewhere. Its fiction list includes both
acclaimed newcomers such as Jeanette Winterson and Mary Flanagan,
and such veterans as Margaret Atwood, John Irving and Paul Bailey.
   One of its first commercial coups was the purchase of British
rights to ``Presumed Innocent,'' American novelist Scott Turow's
best seller.
   But might Bloomsbury itself be taken over?
   ``No, it won't,'' said Newton. ``We've received offers, but are
committed to autonomy.''

<HEAD>High Levels of Radon found in Many European Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of European homes
have high radon levels but officials say many people question the
danger in spite of research linking the colorless, odorless gas to
fatal lung cancer.
   Some researchers feel the continent may be years behind the
United States in developing programs to meet the threat.
   ``We were two years behind the United States in recognizing the
problem and it will take another two to three years to catch up,''
said Bernd Franke of the West German Institute for Energy and
Environmental Research in Heidelberg.
   A traditional popular belief that the gas has curative powers
compounds the problem. A few radon spas still operate in Austria
and Hungary, and people still descend into deep caves in hopes the
gas will help cure rheumatism and other ailments.
   Radon is a radioactive gas produced in the decay of uranium, of
which at least trace amounts are present in all soil and rock.
   It tends to concentrate on the lower floors of buildings and
kills by leaving its a residue in the lungs that irradiates the
tissues for a lifetime. Smoking substantially increases the danger
from radon, according to health officials.
   U.S. health officials say radon exposure is second only to
smoking as a cause of lung cancer and up to 20,000 Americans die of
its effects each year. Legislation pending in Congress would
require inspections of public schools and set a long-term goal of
making air equally low in radon indoors and outdoors.
   American officials have declared 4 picocuries of radon per liter
of air (150 becquerel per cubic meter) to be the level at which
homeowners should take preventive action. That is the equivalent of
smoking 10 cigarettes a day or having 200-300 chest X-rays a year.
   West Germany recently set radon action limits at 250 becquerel
per cubic meter, the equivalent of 6.6 picocuries. The limit for
new houses in Sweden is 75 becquerel, or 2 picocuries.
   Extensive testing and research programs are under way in
Britain, West Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland.
   ``It's going to take a long time to pin down the houses at
risk,'' said Matthew Gaines of the National Radiological Protection
Board in Britain. ``We'll be testing until the end of the century.''
   Recent European studies have found:
   _More than 20,000 British homes have high radon levels and
800-900 people die annually as a result of exposure to it. The
Radiological Protection Board is testing a sample 17,000 homes,
most of them in Devon and Cornwall where the problem is most
serious.
   _In Sweden, about 40,000 homes have unsafe levels of radon and
roughly 60,000 houses are tested each year. More than 700 deaths a
year are attributed to the gas and officials say the rate could
reach 1,100 in the early 1990s.
   _Up to 190,000 homes in West Germany have radon levels above
government safety standards and about 2,000 radon-related deaths
occur annually. Initial tests show the highest levels in the south
and southwest.
   _Homes in volcanic areas of the upper Lazio region north of Rome
had Italy's highest radon concentrations.
   _Most homes in Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece
showed little radon risk to residents.
   French officials have said radon is not a serious health risk in
that country and some have discounted publicity about the gas in
the United States and elsewhere.
   ``It's a question that's been a bit blown up in the media,''
said Jean-Pierre Moroni of the government radiation control agency.
``There's a very simple measure. ... Open a window when you get up.
It's a matter of good sense. It amounts to not living all closed
up.''
   French environmental activists disagree.
   ``To say there is no problem in France is a mistake,'' said
Corinne Castanier, who speaks for the Independent Regional
Commission for Information on Radioactivity.
   She said her group, established after the Chernobyl nuclear
accident in 1986, has found high levels in some homes in the
mountainous Massif Central region.
   Officials in Britain and West Germany say they have trouble
convincing residents of the danger.
   ``I think a lot of the reaction is a bit skeptical,'' said
Albert Weeks, chief building control inspector for the Kerrier
District Council in Cornwall, southwest England.
   ``It's almost a non-belief. They don't really think it's that
bad. They say `We've been living with it for X number of years and
it doesn't seem to affect us.''' Weeks said.
   Sweden, where 10 percent of the land area contains high-risk
levels of radon, has led the way in testing and helping homeowners
reduce their risk of radon exposure.
   A new law provides financial help for homeowners who make
radon-reducing improvements. The government also has begun a study
of 4,500 people to gain more information on the relationship
between radon and lung cancer.

   The South, long considered an educational
backwater, is recognizing that its high illiteracy and school
dropout rates can only drain its economic health. The problem was
highlighted this month by a report warning that the region ``is at
risk of creating a permanent, massive pool of undereducated
citizens unable to support themselves.'' This story examines some
local efforts to teach people to read.

<TEXT>
   Afraid of being left behind economically and
culturally, this central Georgia city is mobilizing for battle. The
enemy is illiteracy.
   And Macon is not alone, as communities all over the South are
waking up to the dollars-and-cents drawbacks of illiteracy.
   One of every three Macon adults is considered to be functionally
illiterate, the highest rate in the nation for a city with more
than 100,000 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
   ``We're supposed to have a 37 percent illiteracy rate,'' said
Cheryl Kelly, the director of ``Project Read'' in Macon. ``We know
we've got a big problem here, but the truth is we're not all that
much different from the rest of the state, or the region, for that
matter.''
   Kelly and a visitor were surrounded by banks of computers and
color-coded typewriters in Bibb County's spanking new reading
laboratory. The lab, which officially opened on National Literacy
Day, Sept. 8, is the first of five such centers to be installed in
the county over the next several years.
   Aimed at adults who either read poorly or not at all, Project
Read has a $350,000 war chest, including a $100,000 Knight
Foundation grant and $46,000 from the Junior League of Macon.
Project Read is one of several ambitious undertakings in which the
public and private sectors have joined forces to help Southerners
learn to read.
   The ``City of Readers'' project in Chattanooga, Tenn., is such
an effort. Backed by a $35,000 grant from the General Electric
Foundation, the Chattanooga project also began Sept. 8. It differs
from Macon's approach in that it is aimed primarily at school
children and their parents.
   ``We are stressing that reading can be fun,'' said Shirley
Spiers, director of City of Readers. ``We're giving away books,
setting aside a `reading hour' in the schools and making every
effort to get parents and children involved in recreational
reading.''
   According to the Southern Regional Education Board, one of every
seven adults in the South reads below a fourth-grade level. In
addition, the SREB said, the South claims nine of the 10 states
with the highest percentage of high school dropouts. Listing the
highest rates first, the states are Kentucky, Mississippi, South
Carolina, Arkansas, North Carolina, West Virginia, Tennessee,
Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana.
   Because of such factors, ``shortages of educated and skilled
workers become an increasing barrier to the competitiveness of
Southern business and industry,'' according to a report presented
to Congress earlier this month by the Sunbelt Institute, a
nonprofit research organization that studies regional issues.
   The report urged Congress to do more to eradicate illiteracy and
to get private groups and businesses to join the battle.
   Skirmishes are breaking out: In Alabama, Gov. Guy Hunt just
signed a $2.4 billion education budget, highest in the state's
history; Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee have set up
literacy programs, and Virginia has appropriated nearly $3 million
to attack adult illiteracy next year.
   Mississippi hired a former federal education official at $76,000
a year, $13,000 more than the governor is paid, to head the new
Governor's Office for Literacy.
   ``We've all got much the same situation,'' said Kelly, a former
elementary school reading teacher in Macon. ``Many of our older
functionally illiterate adults, those who read below a fourth-grade
level, quit school early to go to work in agriculture or in the
textile mills.
   ``The younger ones, those in their 20s, tend to be
semi-illiterate, reading on an eighth-grade level, because they
attended class longer. But they frequently were pushed along
through school, from grade to grade, on the mistaken assumption
that we were doing children a disservice by holding them back.''
   Macon leaders realized the severity of the problem when local
industries began complaining about the shortage of qualified
applicants.
   Last year, a Census report on black Americans listed Bibb County
at the bottom in educational attainment by blacks.
   But Kelly says Macon's illiteracy is not segregated.
   ``In fact,'' she added, ``there doesn't seem to be any
particular pattern among the people who have come to us seeking
help. Our average participant last year was 39, and the ratio of
men and woman and blacks and whites broke down to about 50-50.''
   A major catalyst for Project Read, Kelly said, was local
response to a television program on illiteracy aired two years ago
by ABC and public television.
   ``The day after the special ran, we were inundated with calls
from people wanting help and from people wanting to help,'' she
said. ``The county director of adult education was swamped and he
turned to me and said, `Do something.' I went out looking for
volunteers. A few months later, when it was apparent to everyone
that we were totally unequipped to deal with the problem, the mayor
called a meeting of community leaders.'' A steering committee
created Project Read in January 1987.
   At the time, she said, the county's main adult education thrust
was aimed at helping people get their high school equivalency
diplomas.
   ``It never seemed important or desirable to educate our total
population before,'' said Robert Williams, recently retired as a
Bibb County deputy school superintendent.
   Charles Gatlin of the Greater Macon Chamber of Commerce said the
old approach was out of step with changing labor needs.
   ``In the past,'' he said, ``we were able to get by and keep a
low unemployment rate with a poorly educated work force because our
labor needs had traditionally stressed manual dexterity over
scholastics. ... Now we're picking up the kind of jobs that require
more education, technical jobs connected with the aerospace
industry over at Robins Air Force Base, and new jobs in
manufacturing and retailing.''
   Project Read now has ``two full-time teachers, a secretary, five
full-time VISTA volunteers and a couple of hundred volunteers from
the community,'' Kelly said. The volunteers do one-on-one training,
while the VISTA volunteers go out in search of program participants.
   ``We're using an IBM reading program is designed to move people
rapidly along toward literacy,'' Kelly said. Students work on video
screens, which they touch to change cartoon story lines,
progressing from phonetic sounds to inserting complete words.
   Kelly said Project Read also includes an intense media campaign
stressing the need to read.
   ``We're ready to teach 16 people an hour in the lab,'' Kelly
said. ``However, there is a slight hitch. We have a target
population of 33,000 adults in Bibb County but, so far, only 125
people have signed up.
   ``You can see we have our work cut out for us. Getting people to
overcome their fears and reluctance is going to be a challenge.''

<BYLINE>``Songs of the Aztecs''
^By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What could easily be one of only operas ever
performed in ancient langauge of the Aztecs will be staged at the
Pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico.
   Tenor Placido Domingo, singing in Nauhatl, will star in the
premiere of Lalo Schifrin's ``Songs of the Aztecs'' on the stone
stage of the Square of the Moon, built centuries ago by ancient
Meso-Americans.
   Schifrin will conduct the Mexico Philharmonic at the Oct. 29
event, a benefit to launch a campaign for the restoration of the
Aztec Temple of Teotihuacan, an hour's drive from Mexico City.
American Express has pledged $100,000 toward the restoration.
   The composer said doing an opera in Nauhatl was not a serious
problem. ``The chorus and singers are used to the phonetics of a
foreign language,'' he said.
   ``I thought it would be better to do it in the original
language. With a translation, the use of a dictionary and grammar,
I was able to work it out. Chocolatl was a secret drink of the
Aztecs. We say chocolate. Our word coyote comes from their
coyotetl.''
   He was helped by a Nauhatl authority, Dr. Georges Beaudo of the
University of Toulouse in France.
   Schifrin wrote the music after finding some pre-Columbian
poetry, in Spanish, by Nezahualcoyotl (1432-72).
   ``(It) was so beautiful I decided to use it,'' he said. ``The
last line of the poem is, `It cannot be in vain why we come to this
Earth; let us leave some flowers; let us leave some songs.'''
   For the Oct. 29 performance, 10,000 chairs will be set up, a new
sound system built and TV screens put in to provide subtitles in
Spanish and English. ``We're trying to make some of the prices very
popular,'' he said. ``A thousand people are going to pay very, very
high prices. I cannot tell you how much money it takes to preseve
something that is very important. ... To know where we're coming
from is going to help us to know where we're going.''
   The pyramids at Teotihuacan date from 100 B.C. to 100 A.D.
   The site of the concert, Schifrin said, is in the City of the
Gods in a square of stone, the Square of the Moon.
   ``The square is raised; it's exactly the place for the full
symphony, full chorus, soloists and conductor, where musicians used
to play 500 years ago,'' he said. ``It was a stage; they built it
for us. Along a stone avenue are ruins of temples and stairways.
The whole place looks very impressive. We go to Greece and Rome to
find architectural riches but we have it right here.''
   That Schifrin is the composer of so esoteric a work may surprise
those who know him either from his jazz days with Dizzy Gillespie
or as a composer of more than 80 film and TV scores.
   Schifrin, who is 56, was born in Buenos Aires, where his father
was concertmaster of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic. He studied
composition and piano at the Paris Conservatory, and returned to
Buenos Aires where he became a composer, arranger, conductor and
pianist, in pop, jazz and classical music.
   ``I've seen opera since I was a child. I had a dramatic
instinct. This is probably one of the first times I'm saying this
openly but I think movies are the opera of today,'' he said.
   ``In `The Cincinnati Kid,' where I had Ray Charles playing along
with a symphony orchestra, it was not pop music. This was really
serious music _ to me, and I think to many people.
   ``The score of `Bullitt' is being played by symphony orchestras
now. I did an arrangement of symphonic sketches from the score of
`Cool Hand Luke.'''
   He moved to the United States in 1958 and played piano in
Gillespie's quintet from 1960-62. He composed ``Gillespiana Suite''
for the first record he on which he played with Dizzy.
   ``Many people think I went to Hollywood to make money,'' she
said. ``I didn't have any idea about how much money I was going to
make. There is a group of composers in New York and there is no
outlet to play their music. Duke Ellington was the only example
since Haydn to have his own orchestra to play his own music. The
reason I went to Hollywood was, there was an outlet for hearing
your music you composed.''
   Lately, he has done less film composing and more conducting.
Last December, he became music director of the Paris Philharmonic.
Their first recording together, Ravel's ``Mother Goose,''
Stravinsky's ``Petrushka'' and Schifrin's double bass concerto with
soloist Gary Karr, is being released this fall.
   ``I think music is to be shared, and not only through mechanical
means like records. You can be in a theater or even a stadium,
doing something for several thousand people. That is very
thrilling.''

<HEAD>What Drove the U.S. into Grenada: The Debate Isn't Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan likes to boast that Marxists
have not gained a ``single square inch'' of territory during his
tenure, and one of his more satisfying moments occurred when a
communist government actually was uprooted.
   Rolling back communism was once an American cold war battle cry
but Marxist regimes always proved remarkably resilient. In the
post-World War II era, the trend was constant: When Marxists took
power, they were there to stay.
   Five years ago that pattern was interrupted. On Oct. 25, 1983,
U.S. troops, aided by forces from seven friendly Caribbean
countries, deposed the leftist government in Grenada.
   Was the administration telling the truth when it said the
invasion was justified by dangers confronting the more than 700
American medical students on the island? Or was that just an excuse
for striking a blow against a country simply because it had ties to
the Soviet bloc?
   Was Grenada an event of transcendental importance or merely a
speck on the historical horizon? Did the Soviets see Grenada, with
its deep water port, as an ideal stopping off place for nuclear
missile submarines?
   To Michael Ledeen, a former administration aide who spent months
studying official documents captured on Grenada by U.S. military
forces, the events of October 1983 had an ``enormous impact''
psychologically.
   ``It may well be that 20 years from now, people will say that
was the beginning of the end of the Soviet empire,'' Ledeen said.
   ``The Russians had always claimed that once a country became
part of communist world, it was there to stay. Grenada proved that
it wasn't.''
   But former National Security Council aide Oliver L. North felt
that Grenada could not be regarded as a major defeat for
international communism because the government there was ousted by
foreign invaders, not by a popular uprising.
   Assistant Secretary of State Langhorne A. Motley who, like
North, played a key behind-the scenes role in coordinating the
invasion, said the episode sent a clear message to America's
friends and adversaries.
   ``It showed that the United States was prepared to use force in
the defense of its national interests,'' said Motley, who left
government service in 1985.
   Motley insisted that the driving force behind the invasion was
concern for the fate of the American medical students on the island
after leftist opponents of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop deposed
and then executed him and about 50 of his supporters on the
bloodiest day in Grenada's history.
   Afterward, the revolutionary military council which ousted
Bishop imposed a 24-hour curfew. Motley noted there was no official
U.S. presence on the island and said State Department efforts to
obtain information about the students were unsuccessful.
   He and other officials were haunted by the memory of the 52
American hostages who had been detained by Iranian militants for
444 days. As Motley described it, alarm at the State Department
mounted as the days passed with no word on whether the students
were safe.
   He ridiculed the notion that the prime U.S. concern in going
ahead with the invasion was the existence of a pro-Soviet
government in Grenada.
   ``The primary and overwhelming consideration was the safety of
the students,'' he said.
   But Cuban President Fidel Castro has said the administration
fabricated a ``mountain of lies'' about the supposed dangers
confronting the students. He felt the administration was guided
above all by aggressive intentions.
   Ramon Sanchez Parodi, head of Cuba's diplomatic mission in
Washington, said the stated U.S. concern about the students was a
``very thin veil'' covering the Reagan administration's true intent.
   ``There was no effort of a non-military nature to take the
students out,'' Sanchez Parodi said. The United States, he said,
had no purpose other than to ``impose its will'' on the people of
Grenada. In the aftermath, Cuba moved quickly to bolster its own
self-defense, worried that it might be the next American target.
   Answering critics, Reagan noted that the U.S. intervention was
carried out at the request of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States, which was worried about Grenada being used as a base of
subversion against Caribbean democracies. Some had security forces
totaling only a few dozen compared with Grenada's force of 4,000.
   When the Reagan administration took office in 1981, it found the
trends in the Caribbean area worrisome. Leftist governments had
assumed power over the previous two years in Grenada, Nicaragua and
Suriname.
   In Grenada, Bishop's government moved quickly to establish close
ties with Cuba. A large contingent of Cubans began constructing an
airport capable of handling Cuba's large fleet of MiG jet fighters.
   Although Bishop insisted that the airport was designed for
commercial purposes, U.S. military analysts were concerned that the
facility had the potential for enabling Cuba to project its
military power for the first time into the northern tier of South
America. Captured documents showed that Grenada had entered into
three military agreements with the Soviet Union and one each with
Cuba and North Korea _ all secret.
   Whatever the objectives of the Soviet bloc in Grenada might have
been, the ouster of a friendly government there and its replacement
by an avowedly pro-American regime was a setback, especially for
Castro.
   Cuba had committed substantial resources in Grenada for more
than four years and Castro had nothing to show for it. The 25th
anniversary of his own revolution, which occurred nine weeks after
the Grenada invasion, was a low key affair instead of the big
extravaganza he had planned.
   The invasion also produced shock waves in Nicaragua and
Suriname. In Managua, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega was
determined not to allow the United States to use the same pretext
for invading Nicaragua as it did in Grenada.
   He called U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quainton and offered him
unlimited use of Nicaragua's bus fleet to evacuate Americans from
the country. In Suriname, military leader Desi Bouterse, worried
that the large and growing Cuban presence in his country might be
seen as a provocation by the United States, ordered the Cubans home.
   Delighted that the invasion seemed to make America's adversaries
in the hemisphere squirm, one official facetiously said at the time
that the best way to deal with Nicaragua was to set up a medical
school for Americans in the country.
   The invasion, of course, was not cost-free. Eighteen Americans,
45 Grenadans and 29 Cubans were killed during the fighting.
   But given the fact that the students were spared potential harm
and the Soviet bloc had lost an ally in the process, the
administration felt the loss of life was worth it.
   The episode helped ease the anguish of what was perhaps the
darkest moment of the Reagan presidency: the deaths of 241 U.S.
Marines in a bombing incident in Lebanon just two days before the
Grenada invasion.

<HEAD>Airline Deregulation: Mega-Carriers, Safety Concerns, Fare
Confusion</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   On the day Vicki Belcher wanted to fly from
Washington to Miami, an Eastern Airlines advertisement proclaimed a
$189 roundtrip fare with advance purchase.
   But Ms. Belcher, her mother and aunt needed a flight right away,
to attend an uncle's funeral, and the cheapest fare they could get
was almost $600 each.
   ``We just didn't go,'' says the Washington librarian, lamenting
the $1,800 cost for the three tickets.
   The reason for the divergent fares _ the Airline Deregulation
Act, which ended government controls over airline fares and routes
and was designed to bring competition to the airline industry and
lower fares.
   On the 10th anniversary of President Carter's signing of the
measure, air travel bargains still abound, but so do shockingly
high fares for travelers who do not have the luxury of planning far
ahead or being flexibile. And the cost of travel no longer has
anything to do with how many miles one flies.
   While a recent traveler booked a restricted vacation flight on
Braniff Airlines that took him from Washington to Los Angeles to
Orlando, Fla., and back to Washington for $364, an unrestricted
roundtrip coach fare from Washington to Charleston, S.C., on
Piedmont was $390 and one from Washington to Chicago on United
Airlines was $498.
   And after a decade of air travel without strict government
controls there also are:
   _Increasing complaints about the concentration of the industry
around a few ``mega-carriers'' and about the dominance they wield
in and out of some cities, and through links with commuter airlines
to entire regions of the country.
   _Unprecedented congestion at busy airports and in the skies
surrounding them with some airport planners _ notably in Boston _
resorting to high landing fees to keep out smaller aircraft.
   _Concerns among aviation safety with critics both in and out of
the industry complaining that the federal government is unable to
keep up with traffic growth and industry fluctuations to assure a
continuing high level of safety.
   _Predictions of catastrophe and ``defacto re-regulation'' unless
airports are expanded, new airports built and the Federal Aviation
Administration's air traffic control system is modernized.
   _Complaints that airline service continues to deteriorate,
especially in rural areas, while prices are allowed to soar
unfairly high in some markets, especially between busy ``hub''
airports dominated by one or two airlines.
   _A realization by industry insiders that the days of aviation
entrepreneurs starting an airline from scratch and taking on the
competition has long passed, the victim of the same
``mega-carriers.''
   ``Unless you go with one of the major carriers in a (market)
sharing arrangement, it would be extremely difficult to start
something from scratch today,'' says Harold ``Hap'' Pareti, who has
done it twice, first with People Express and later with
Presidential Airways.
   Perhaps nothing marks more clearly the first decade of
deregulation as the emergence of the ``mega-carriers'' that
dominate air travel. They are the product of 3{ years in which the
Transportation Department approved 21 straight airline mergers.
   At the end of 1987, the country's five biggest airlines carried
nearly 70 percent of the traffic, according to industry figures.
Single airlines account for eight of every 10 flights in and out of
St. Louis, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Memphis and Charlotte. One
airline controls more than half of all flights in and out of 18
``hub'' airports across the country, says an analysis by the Boeing
Co.
   While there is little hunger for a return of government controls
on fares and routes, Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., during a recent
hearing on airline concentration echoed the sentiment of other
members of Congress and even otherwise staunch supporters of
deregulation: ``The concern that is before us is whether
competition is truly working. And if it is not working what are we
supposed to do about it.''
   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., chairman of the House aviation
subcommittee, agreed: ``The question which the new Congress and the
next administration must explore in depth are first, whether there
is still enough competition to sustain the consumer benefits of
deregulation and second, if not, what should be done.''
   Alfred Kahn, the former Civil Aeronautics Board chairman and one
of the architects of airline deregulation, remains one of its
strongest defenders, but also concedes some elements of today's
market-oriented industry have gone awry and ``urgently cry out for
at least some government remedies.''
   Nevertheless, says Kahn, ``the overwhelming majority of
passengers are clearly reaping huge benefits'' and deregulation
overall ``has brought to the overwhelming majority of travelers in
abundant measure, most of the benefits that we expected.''
   There have been dozens of reports and papers that draw the same
conclusion.
   Virtually no one espouses bringing airline fares and routes back
under government control. Some industry insiders suggest that since
the airline industry has so dramatically reorganized itself,
committed itself to a free-market environment, and adopted such
complex systems of established fares _ down to a sophisticated
seat-by-seat fare structure _ that to try to bring back government
control would only lead to chaos.
   And supporters of deregulation are quick to tick off what they
call its overwhelming benefits:
   _Last year 450 million passengers boarded commercial airliners,
compared to 275 million in l978. In another 10 years the number is
expected to reach 800 million.
   _With nine out of 10 air travelers flying on some sort of
discount fare, the average cost of travel on an airliner has
dropped 13 percent over the last decade if inflation is taken into
account, according to the Transportation Department.
   _Deregulation has allowed air travel to become commonplace with
nearly three of every four adult Americans having flown at least
once in their lifetime. According to a Gallup poll, 52.5 million
adults took an airline trip last year.
   _A planeload of passengers takes off from an airport somewhere
in the country on an average of every 4.8 seconds.
   ``We have indeed become a vehicle of mass transportation,'' says
Jim Landry, vice president and counsel for the Air Transport
Association, the industry group that represents the major airlines.
   Several studies of deregulation contend that travelers and the
economy as a whole have immensely benefitted. According to one, by
the Brookings Institution, an estimated $10 billion in l988 dollars
has been saved because of airline deregulation, about a third in
lower fares and the rest in better service and increased
productivity.
   But if service has improved, it wasn't very evident in l986 and
on into l987 when air travelers almost were threatening revolts
because of long and frequent delays and shoddy service on some
airlines.
   Delays attributed to air traffic problems alone shot up 25
percent in l986 and complaints from irate airline customers to the
Transportation Department quadrupled. In those days travelers on
Northwest, Eastern or Continental _ all airlines struggling to deal
with massive mergers _ had a chance of one in two of getting to
their destination within 15 minutes of schedule.
   The industry acknowledged the problems.
   ``Service is deteriorating, complaints are rising, the skies and
airports are crowded and the entire system is creaking as we seek
to accommodate the waves of customers brought to our ticket
counters by deregulation _ and cheap fares,'' American Airlines
President Robert Crandall told an audience in June l987.

   The government sprang into action, though some said it was too
late.
   Congress came close to approving a broad-ranging air traveler's
``bill of rights'' that called for airlines to disclose such things
as on-time performance, lost baggage and passengers bumped. It also
demanded that schedules be made more realistic and called for
restrictions on flights at virtually all major airports to solve
the delay problem, a provision particularly worrisome to the
airline industry.
   While the bill still rests in Congress, it was enough to prompt
the Transportation Department to direct for the first time a year
ago that the airlines disclose monthly consumer information
including their on-time performance.
   The department also called on the air carriers to make their
schedules closer to actual flying time and spread out flights at
the busiest airports during peak travel periods, ending such
absurdities as had been common at Chicago's O'Hare airport: 36
flights scheduled to arrive at precisely 9:15 a.m.
   This year the number of both delays and complaints has been down
dramatically, something industry experts attribute to the fact that
several of the largest airlines _ Continental, Northwest, and TWA _
have overcome early merger problems, and the tougher government
stance.
   In any case, airline deregulation was never intended to be ``a
Nirvana ... (We knew) there would be bumps in the road and
unforseen economic consequences,'' says Philip Bakes, now the
president of Eastern Airlines, but in the l970s a Senate staffer
influential in drawing up the deregulation law and later an
attorney for the Civil Aeronautics Board.
   ``The scorecard clearly says it's been good for the consumer.
But deregulation was never claimed to be a cure-all,'' says Bakes.
   Adds Kahn, ``The principle failures, by far, have been failures
on the part of government ... to fulfill its responsibilities.''
   Nowhere has the critism of the federal government been more
acute _ with the possible exception of its monitoring of safety _
than in its handling of airline mergers.
   ``There has been an almost total hands off approach by
government. You can call it a honeymoon. We went from total
regulation to total deregulation,'' says Edmund Greenslet, a
longtime airline analyst and follower of the industry. ``The
government said, literally, anything you guys want to do you can
do.''
   When the government in l985 approved United Airlines' request to
buy Pan American World Airways' Pacific Division, it unleashed the
avalanche of airline consolidation.
   ``The prime objective of every airline today is to establish
critical mass,'' says Robert Joedicke, an analyst for Shearson
Lehman Sutton.
   And the Transportatin Department, critics say, has done
everything it can to help in that objective. It reviewed 21 mergers
and approved them all.
   Northwest Airlines, which felt threatened by a strong United
pushing into the Pacific, absorbed Republic Airlines; TWA, wishing
to consolidate its hold on St. Louis, bought arch competitor Ozark
Air Lines; Texas Air Corp., the parent of Continental, went on a
buying spree and captured Eastern, People Express and Frontier;
Delta Air Lines, seeking to spread along the West Coast, merged
with Western Airlines; American Airlines, wanting to do likewise,
bought Air California; and USAir fearing it would become a target
itself, bought Pacific Southwest and then Piedmont.
   In the final years of the Civil Aeronautics Board nearly a
decade ago, a proposed merger of Continental and Western airlines
was turned down because of fears that it would create too much
concentration at Denver, recalls Elizabeth Bailey, a former board
member and now a dean at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
   Such mergers as TWA-Ozark and Northwest-Republic, both opposed
by the Justice Department, ``would have had a very hard, tough time
getting through our regulatory board,'' she says.
   ``In effect,'' says Oris Dunham, director of the Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport, ``a private market cartel has begun to
form'' as the largest airlines have staked out their territories.
   In the markets dominated by one or two carriers the airlines
have ``begun jacking up prices'' and use long-term leasing
agreements, advantages of frequent flyer programs and their
airline-owned computer reservation systems to keep out competitors,
adds Dunham, the chairman of the Airport Operators Council
International.
   An analysis by the Boeing Co., says that at 18 ``hub'' airports
where a single airline had 50 percent of the traffic, travelers
flying through the hub on connecting flights pay as much as 30
percent below average fares. But travelers whose trip begins or
ends at the hubs usually pay as much as 40 or 50 percent more in
some cases.
   Mark Cooper, who watches the airline industry for the Consumer
Federation of America, calls it ``price gouging'' and suggests,
``Whatever benefits there are (under deregulation) are getting
awfully thin.''
   ``Deregulation should not mean and cannot mean that airlines can
create monopoly situations and, therefore, do anything they darned
well please,'' says Sen. Danforth, the Missouri Republican who is a
ranking minority members of the Senate Commerce Committee.
   The airlines deny they are doing anything but working with the
cards they have drawn under deregulation. And they suggest the
fares are far from unreasonable.
   ``It is difficult to understand that if the airlines are
overcharging the public, why then are there not impressive profits
being realized,'' says Robert Cozzi, vice president for revenue
management at Trans World Airlines.
   Last year the airlines had operating profits of $2.46 billion,
but largely because of high interest costs related to the purchase
of hundreds of new aircraft, their net profits were only $601
million, a scant profit margin of 1.1 percent.

   The crash of 1987 cast a shadow over Wall Street
on its first anniversary as a political rumor knocked the
still-skittish stock market off a post-crash high.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 22.58 points
Wednesday to 2,137.27 in a faint echo of the 508-point drop on Oct.
19, 1987, when panic wiped out half a trillion dollars of stock
wealth.
   The rumor was that the Washington Post would publish a story
potentially damaging to the presidential campaign of Vice President
George Bush. The Post denied it. But traders who had made profits
in the market's recent rise were primed to sell, and they did.

   A rebound in apartment construction offset a
decline in single-family home building, boosting overall housing
activity by a moderate 1.5 percent last month, the government said.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that new homes and
apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.45
million units in September.
   It was the fourth consecutive month that starts have held steady
between a rate of 1.43 million and 1.48 million units.

   The nation's milk production has slowed from

level in 1988, an Agriculture Department report said.
   Part of the slowdown was attributed Wednesday to higher feed

   U.S. milk output declined in 1987 to 142.5 billion pounds from a

forecast last spring to rise 2 percent to 3 percent from 1987.

   America's apartment sector staged a turnaround last month
despite a decline in single-family home building, while the stock
market slumped in last-minute trading as Wall Street recalled the
first anniversary of the crash of 1987.
   The stock market lost most of its gains of a day earlier as the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 22.58 points to close
at 2,137.27
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the building of new
houses and apartments remained steady at an annual rate of 1.45
million units in September.
   Construction of single-family homes slowed 2.3 percent from
August to an annual rate of 1.05 million units, the government
said, but apartment construction soared 13.2 percent. In August,
the number of new apartments built fell 13.0 percent to the lowest
levels since the end of the last recession in 1982.
   Analysts had predicted a slowdown in housing activity this year
as interest rates increased. But the sector has held up somewhat
better than anticipated.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgages hit a low of 9.84 percent in early spring,
climbed to 10.71 percent in mid-August and by last week eased to
10.33 percent.
   In the first nine months of this year, starts are running 10.5
percent behind the same period of last year, on track for about
1.45 million units by year end. Economists anticipate a further
decline next year.
   Building permits, a good indicator of future housing activity,
fell 4.4 percent in September to an annual rate of 1.40 million
units, after rising 3.1 percent in August.
   Driving Wednesday's stock market late in the day was a rumor
that the Washington Post would publish a story potentially damaging
to the presidential campaign of Vice President George Bush. The
Post denied it. But traders who had made profits in the market's
recent rise were primed to sell, and they did.
   Analysts also attributed last-minute selling to weakness in the
bond market and some selling by professional traders engaged in
computer program strategies. Bond prices were pushed down by a
sharp rise in oil prices.
   In addition, brokers some investors were being cautious in
advance of the government's scheduled report Friday on the consumer
price index for September.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Soar on Eve of OPEC Committee Meetings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices rose sharply in the session
prior to meetings of two OPEC committees expected to focus on
rampant overproduction by the cartel's members.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, jumped 79 cents Wednesday to close at $15.40 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Tuesday,
the November contract plunged 60 cents.
   The wide price swings reflected traders' alternating optimism
and pessimism in advance of meetings of the OPEC strategy and
pricing committees to begin today in Madrid, Spain.
   Overproduction by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries sent the price of oil skidding below the
$12.30-a-barrel mark recently. Hopes of an agreement to rein in
production brought prices back up in the past two weeks.
   Prices surged Wednesday ``on the anticipation of something
positive coming out of this meeting,'' said Jim Colburn, a broker
at E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Colburn said traders bought heavily Wednesday after the Kuwaiti
oil minister said his country would agree to abide by its OPEC
production quota if the cartel's other members also agreed to
respect their individual ceilings.
   Over the weekend, oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council met and proposed an overall OPEC production
ceiling of 18.5 million to 19 million barrels a day. The cartel's
daily output is now estimated at more than 21 million barrels.
   The GCC proposal was expected to be presented to the two OPEC
committees.
   Colburn said oil trading was expected to remain volatile in
coming weeks. OPEC has scheduled a full ministerial meeting on Nov.
21.
   Refined products traded on the Mercantile Exchange also were
sharply higher Wednesday. The November contract for wholesale
unleaded gasoline rose 2.14 cents to settle at 49.06 cents a
gallon, and the November contract for home heating oil picked up
1.56 cents to close at 43.85 cents a gallon.

   Robert O'Toole still remembers the sick feeling
in the pit of his stomach a year ago when the stock market hurtled
out of control.
   ``For an instant it looked like we were going out of business
and I saw 33 years going down the drain,'' recalled the 53-year-old
manager of over-the-counter stock trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   O'Toole lined up on the first anniversary of the crash Wednesday
for a special buffet lunch of steak, turkey, ham, salads and
champagne.
   ``This is our answer to the crash,'' he said. ``We're all still
here and we can afford lunch.''
   Skittishness created by the crash lingered in the market on
Wednesday as a political rumor helped drive the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrial stocks down 22.58 to 2,137.27.
   A year earlier, the average fell 508 points and $500 billion of
stock wealth was wiped out.
   The rumor was that the Washington Post would publish a story
potentially damaging to the presidential campaign of Vice President
George Bush. The Post denied it. But traders who had made profits
in the market's recent rise were primed to sell, and they did.
   Reporters from Brazil, France, Italy, Japan and New Jersey nosed
around for stories Wednesday, scholars discussed great panics of
the past, and author Tom Wolfe posed for pictures near the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Once again in the public eye, traders expressed disappointment
at the slowness of business this year but relief that the crash did
not permanently fracture the markets.
   CBS broadcast its morning show from a balcony over the floor of
the New York Stock Exchange. Outside, George Tonelli sold bumper
stickers reading, ``I survived the stock crash of '87. But I used
to drive a Mercedes.''
   Except for a few seconds of boos and cheers at the opening bell,
the NYSE operated as usual, an army of red- and blue-jacketed
workers swarming around clusters of green computer screens.
   Only Tuesday, the Dow Jones average had hit 2,159.85, its
highest point since the 1987 debacle. On Wednesday, the Dow had
been down about 12 points when the Bush rumor struck late in the
afternoon.
   The 1987 crash brought some prominent firms close to collapse as
credit nearly dried up, and those memories came flooding back on
the anniversary.
   ``We went through hell. People were perspiring, wide-eyed. ...
We had to show signs of confidence when we weren't sure what was
going to happen ... We were concerned that guys wouldn't have
strokes or heart attacks,'' recalled Peter DaPuzzo, O'Toole's boss
at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   People still could not agree what to call what happened on Oct.
19, 1987: ``crash,'' ``market break,'' or _ as David Ruder, the
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, prefers _ ``a
compressed large downward move in stock prices.''
   Scholars compared the 1987 crash to the Dutch tulip mania of
1634-37 and the South Sea Bubble of 1720, not to mention U.S. stock
market crashes of 1873, 1884, 1893, 1907 and 1929.
   ``These aren't singular phenomena. They do recur and they share
common characteristics,'' said Eugene White of Rutgers University,
who was attending the symposium at New York University's Salomon
Brothers Center.
   ``After the New Deal reforms everyone thought the markets could
be crash-proof. Obviously that's not the case.''

   One year after the October crash, the stock market
remains a dangerous place for small investors seeking quick
profits, says the president of the American Stock Exchange.
   For an individual to ``dart in and out of the market'' in
competition with institutional investors ``is like me trying to
take on Ivan Lendl in tennis,'' said AMEX President Kenneth R.
Leibling.
   Still, Leibling noted Wednesday, stocks historically have been a
better long-term investment than bank accounts, bonds or money
market funds.''
   While individual investors shouldn't ``play'' the market,
Leibling said the stock market remains ``a superior means of
investment if an individual is prepared to invest based on the
fundamentals and particularly on a long-term basis.''
   Leibling, 39, in Boston for an executive symposium sponsored by
General Electric Co., said during a news conference that he thought
the chances of another crash were slight, mainly because the U.S.
economy is strong and ``the market appears to be quite reasonably
valued by historic standards and in relation to corporate profits.''
   But Leibling stressed there is no guarantee it won't happen
again, despite newly approved circuit breakers that will halt
trading temporarily if stock prices take a sudden plunge.
   ``There is a school of thought that says that as the market
moves toward (the circuit breaker), investors may rush to get out
knowing that the market's going to close, and it may even
exacerbate the trend,'' he said.
   ``There is no experience with this in the markets, and I don't
think there is any guarantee that this will be productive,'' he
added.
   The circuit breaker plan was approved Tuesday as a one-year
experiment by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   If the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks drops 250
points in a single day, trading on all major U.S. exchanges will
automatically be halted for one hour.
   If there is an additional 150 point plunge, for a total of 400
points in a single day, a second circuit breaker will impose a
two-hour halt.
   Leibling said he does not foresee any major rise or fall in
stock prices in the near future.
   He predicted that if Republican Vice President George Bush wins
the presidential election, ``there will be a continuity that could
have a positive effect'' on the markets.
   If Democrat Michael Dukakis wins, on the other hand, ``there
will be concern about changes,'' but the market's response is
uncertain.
   ``Traditionally it's perceived on Wall Street that Republican
adminsitrations will be better for the market. Whether they really
are or not is another matter. But many times perceptions dictate
reality when it comes to the market,'' he said.

   The outlook in many areas of Montana's
economy may be bleak, but for the metals mining industry, the
horizon sparkles in gold, platinum and copper hues, experts say.
   ``The future looks real good,'' said Joe Dewey, general manager
of Stillwater Mining Co., the nation's only platinum mine. ``We've
been in a continual expansion mode ... The demand (for platinum)
outstrips the supply.''
   The Stillwater mine, which employs 356 people in south-central
Montana, has asked the state for permission to operate a second
mine. Propelling the need for platinum is the use of the metal in
catalytic converters, which cut fumes emitted from cars. Platinum
also is being used more frequently by the jewelry industry,
financial experts say.
   Metals mining is the only area in the Montana economy with a
bright future, according to a report released recently by the
Federal Home Loan Bank in Seattle.
   Examples are easy to find. The Jardine Joint Venture gold mine
just north of Yellowstone National Park is expected to begin
full-scale operation next spring, and its new mill will be enclosed
by this winter.
   Higher copper prices mean that 322 workers at Montana Resources
Inc. in Butte will get an additional $800 each in profit-sharing
for the quarter ended Sept. 30, said company vice president Ray
Tilman.
   The Golden Sunlight gold mine in Whitehall, which has about 200
employees, may hire 40 more if expansion plans get the green light
from the state Hardrock Mining Bureau, said mine manager Quayle
Lusty.
   And so far four new gold mines have received state permits to
operate this year, compared to five permits issued in 1987 and six
in 1986.
   The Jardine mine plans to move up to 450 tons of rock a day to
get at gold ore. Gold bullion currently is selling at about $415 a
troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   A Disney-controlled company seeking to
acquire Polaroid Corp. is considering a plan to dismantle the
instant camera pioneer if its hostile takeover succeeds, court
testimony has revealed.
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. President Stanley P. Gold testified
Wednesday on the first day of a critical legal battle with Polaroid
that no decision has been made on the proposal from Wertheim
Schroeder, Shamrock's investment adviser.
   Gold said the investment bank recommended that Shamrock sell off
Polaroid's manufacturing businesses, cut back on research and
development, reduce the administrative staff and settle pending
antitrust litigation with Eastman Kodak Co.
   Previously, Shamrock had said only that it would reverse
Polaroid's decision to enter the 35mm film business, settle the
Kodak suit and sell off certain Polaroid assets. Shamrock advisers
identified those assets as real estate valued at roughly $200
million.
   Polaroid fell 75 cents a share to close at $38.50 in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday.
   Gold was the only witness in the first day of the Chancery Court
trial, which is scheduled to take five days before Vice Chancellor
Caroline Berger. Opening arguments were be given later in the trial.
   Shamrock, a Burbank, Calif.-based television and radio concern
controlled by Roy E. Disney, filed suit in July against Polaroid.
Shamrock is seeking unspecified damages and asking the court to
permanently enjoin or rescind Polaroid's employee stock ownership
plan that would all but prevent Shamrock from acquiring Polaroid.
   The plan places 14 percent of Polaroid stock in employees'
hands. Under Delaware takeover law, a hostile bidder must acquire
more than 85 percent of a target's outstanding shares for control.
   Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware.
   The 10-million-share, $300 million employee stock plan was
announced July 12, the same day Polaroid canceled a July 13 meeting
with Shamrock and a week before Shamrock made its first $40-a-share
bid for Polaroid. Shamrock claims stock plan was designed to thwart
a takeover.
   Shamrock was rebuffed in its unsolicited bid before making a
hostile offer of $42 a share last month that put a value of $2.6
billion on the company that introduced instant snapshots in 1948.
Polaroid said the offer was too low and advised stockholders to
reject it.
   Gold said that if the July 13 meeting had been held, he would
not have told Polaroid he discussed takeover financing with several
banks. He also did not intend to discuss Wertheim Schroeder's
proposals, Gold said.
   ``There was no decision made on those things, and, no, I wasn't
going to tell (Polaroid) about them. We hadn't made any decisions
on (Wertheim Schroeder's) ideas,'' Gold said.
   He said the meeting ``was to determine whether or not we could
have continued dialogue.''
   Gold said that under an agreement with Polaroid, Shamrock was
not to ``make any proposals or offers which would require
disclosure'' during the meeting.
   He acknowledged that selling Polaroid's assets or settling the
Kodak case would not have required public disclosure. Gold also
testified that he had furnished information about the proposals to
several banks, including Wells Fargo and the Bank of Nova Scotia.
   ``But I did not ask them to finance'' the entire acquisition,
Gold said.
   A January trial is scheduled to determine damages in Polaroid's
successful patent infringement lawsuit against Kodak. Polaroid is
seeking $5.7 billion.
   Gold said he told the banks that Shamrock was exploring a
takeover of Polaroid. Shamrock wanted to know if the banks would be
interested in financing the venture if Shamrock decided to proceed,
Gold said.

   ``Right before the game began, in the clubhouse, the guys heard
them say during the pregame show that this may be the worst team
ever put on on the field to play in the fall classic,'' Dodgers
manager Tom Lasorda said. ``Then they started screaming `We'll show
them. We'll show them,' and a few of them started saying `Kill
Costas' or something like that.''
   Instead, the Dodgers took out their anger on the Athletics,
prompting Oakland manager Tony La Russa to question whether more
than the Dodgers were working against his American League champions.
   ``I'm a little aggravated right now because I heard this comment
that one of the broadcasters said on the air that the Dodgers were
the worst hitting club in the majors and that they used that in
their meeting,'' La Russa said. ``It's no big deal, but I'd like to
know how they knew about that and how they used it in the meeting.
   ``I know they were out there working, not watching TV.''

<HEAD>Report: Lamar Hunt To Settle Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lamar Hunt has agreed to pay $17 million to Peru's
state-owned mineral company to settle his part of a jury award
against him and two of his brothers, a published report said.
   An attorney representing Minpeco SA told the Dallas Morning News
a hearing has been set today in New York so the proposed agreement
can be reviewed by a federal judge. Thomas Gorman, representing
Minpeco, said Wednesday court approval is required before the
agreement can become final.
   A $134.6 million verdict was rendered in August against Hunt,
his brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt, and three
other defendants for conspiring to corner the world silver market
nine years ago.
   Tom Whitaker, a spokesman for the Hunt brothers, could not be
reached by telephone by The Associated Press today.
   ``Negotiations have been ongoing for quite some time, and it
would be premature to comment further at this time,'' Whitaker told
the News.
   Minpeco alleged the Hunts, sons of the late oil billionaire H.L.
Hunt, conspired to corner the silver market in late 1979 and early
1980. A federal jury in New York agreed with the company and
awarded it the $134.6 million.
   Gorman said the agreement with Lamar Hunt was reached after
several weeks of negotiations in Washington and New York. He said
plans called for Hunt to pay the settlement by check today.
   Bunker and Herbert Hunt filed for personal bankruptcy in Dallas
late last month. The Chapter 11 filings, which will protect the
Hunts' assets from creditors while they reorganize their finances,
so far have protected them from paying the Minpeco judgment.
   A motion will be filed in bankruptcy court Friday asking the
court to unfreeze the Hunts' assets so Minpeco can pursue
collection efforts against them, Gorman said.
   Bunker Hunt, at the time of the bankruptcy filing, said ``the
thought of even a dime going to the government of Peru is
repugnant.''

<HEAD>Manufacturer Spurns Heightened Takeover Try</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc., citing the opinion of its
financial advisers, today rejected as inadequate a hostile takeover
offer sweetened earlier this week to $74 a share by Cardinal
Acquisition Corp.
   Cardinal, which is controlled by brothers Steven M. and Mitchell
P. Rales of Washington, D.C., increased its offer from $70 a share
on Monday. The latest bid, valued at $2.7 billion, was in the form
of a tender offer that was extended until 11 p.m. Oct. 31.
   The Raleses have been blocked at least temporarily by a federal
appeals court from completing their tender offer pending further
review in Delaware of an Interco legal challenge.
   Interco has alleged that Cardinal failed to divulge that Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., investment bankers, is a co-bidder in the
takeover. Interco also contends the tender offer is leveraged so
high it violates federal securities laws.
   Also today, as part of a restructuring plan that was announced
last month, Interco declared an additional special dividend of
$30.80 per share. The special dividend consists of $24 per share in
cash, including 12 percent interest from Oct. 13 to the date of
payment, and $6.80 per share, the net of the original issue's
discount, of subordinated discount debentures due in 2003.
   ``With today's declaration, we have now declared $55.80 in
special dividends as part of our restructuring program,'' said
Harvey Saligman, board chairman and chief executive officer. ``We
are committed to the timely realization of value to all
shareholders and are hard at work to meet or improve upon the value
goals we have set for our ongoing restructuring program.''
   Cardinal launched its Interco takeover try in July with a
$64-a-share offer that was raised to $70 a share in August.
   Cardinal said on Monday that its new offer is subject to the
same conditions that were imposed with the original tender offer.
Those include attracting 75 percent of Interco's 36.2 million
shares outstanding and the withdrawal of a ``poison pill''
shareholders rights plan.
   The Rales brothers own 8.7 percent of Interco's stock, which
closed Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $71.50, up $1.62{.
   Interco, a broadly based manufacturer and retailer of consumer
products, reported sales of $3.3 billion its last fiscal year. The
company's apparel is merchandised under brand names that included
London Fog, John Alexander and LeTigre. Its footware brands include
Florscheim and Converse and its furniture lines include Ethan Allen
and Broyhill.

   Nissan Motor Co.'s newest sports car, a sleek
two-door with an aerodynamically designed exterior, won top honors
in the Japanese Trade Ministry's prestigious ``Good Design'' awards
program Thursday.
   The Nissan Silvia, whose latest model was introduced this
summer, took the Good Design Grand Prize for the most oustanding
design in the annual competition sponsored by the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
   MITI cited the smooth exterior proportions and curved interior
surfaces of the Silvia, which sells for about 2 million yen, the
equivalent of $15,600, and has a 1.8-liter engine, as setting a
trend in automobile styling for the coming years.
   In the separate categories division, winners included among
others a keyboard synthesizer by Yamaha, a five-door refrigerator
by Matsushita Electric, a microscope by Nikon and a heart pulse
meter by Nihon Koden.
   Winners in the foreign products division included the U.S.
company Polaroid's mini-portrait camera, mountain climbing boots by
Koflach of Austria, a dishwasher by West Germany's Bosch and a
flexible conveyor belt by Flex-Link of Sweden.
   The welfare division included an electric letter opener and sink
faucet filter, and the small and medium-sized enterprise division
included a lampshade, waste paper baskets and an unusual bicycle
with a curved horizontal bar.
   Awards in the ``long life'' division, to commend long-selling
products in the Japanese market, went to among others a line of
dinnerware, a can opener, hanging files, notebooks, a lace curtain
and a mechanical pencil.
   Of the 3,718 products entered, 1,006 were chosen by the ministry
for recognition. There is no monetary prize with the awards, but
manufacturers are allowed to use the ministry's ``G'' mark in
advertisements.
   The Good Design awards were established by the ministry in 1957
to recognize improvements in design standards and the quality of
life. Last year's Grand Prize winner was a fold-up, portable,
overhead projector designed by Ricoh.

Beholder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to all-important pocketbook
issues, George Bush and Michael Dukakis seem to be describing
different countries.
   Bush's America is one whose citizens enjoy unprecedented
prosperity, with 17.8 million new jobs created over the past six
years.
   ``Good jobs at good wages,'' the Republican says, swiping
Dukakis' own tag line.
   Dukakis, however, describes a far different America, where wages
are stagnating and the rich have prospered at the expense of
everyone else.
   ``The rich have gotten richer, the poor have gotten poorer and
those in the middle _ and that means most of us _ are getting
squeezed,'' the Democratic nominee insists.
   The basic argument is over whether high-paying factory jobs are
being replaced by low-paying jobs in the service sector. ``The
United States is becoming a nation of hamburger flippers,'' critics
of President Reagan's economic recovery contend.
   The issue emerged in a 1986 study done for Congress by liberal
economists Barry Bluestone and Bennett Harrison. They argued that
``America may be on the verge of losing its middle class.''
   The two professors reached the startling conclusion that nearly
three-fifths of the jobs created during the Reagan years paid less
than $7,000. By contrast, such low-wage jobs represented just
one-fifth of new jobs during the pre-Reagan 1963-79 period, the
authors said.
   ``New, lower-paid service jobs just won't support a family. For
every new job in Silicon Valley or Wall Street, with high pay and
perks, there are many more jobs in the (shopping) mall that don't
pay much more than minimum wage,'' Bluestone and Bennett write in a
new book, ``The Great U-Turn.''
   A study in September by the Democratic-controlled Senate Budget
Committee reached a similar conclusion.
   ``The dominant trend in American job creation during the 1980s
has been for low-paying jobs to replace those which provided a
middle-class standard of living,'' the report said. ``Between the
peak of the business cycle in 1979 and the latest year of the
current expansion, only 38 percent of the increase in employment
was in middle-wage jobs.''
   Republicans counter that many studies cited by the Democrats
slant their results by counting not only full-time jobs but also
part-time employment, thus lowering the wage averages.
   When part-time jobs are excluded, the statistics show the bulk
of job growth has been in the middle, say the Republicans. To
bolster this view, they point to a recent study by two Bureau of
Labor Statistics economists.
   The BLS study concluded that the middle, defined as earnings
between $20,000 and $60,000, is indeed shrinking but that virtually
all of the families leaving it have moved up, not down.
   The Republicans brag that by almost all measures the Reagan
record looks better than the Jimmy Carter years, when rapid
inflation eroded earnings. The Bush campaign says median family
incomes, after adjusting for inflation, have risen 10 percent
during the Reagan years after falling 7 percent from 1977 to 1981.
   Maybe so, the Dukakis camp says, but this growth has been
supported by a dramatic increase in the number of working wives as
cash-strapped families struggle to maintain their standard of
living.
   ``All across America, we see two parents working harder and
harder to buy what one income could buy before,'' the Massachusetts
governor says.
   And even with more family members working, the median family
income last year of $30,853 got Americans back essentially to where
they were in 1973. After posting rapid gains through the 1950s and
1960s, family incomes have been essentially flat for the past 15
years.
   Economists cite several factors for this development.
   First, the country absorbed large numbers of new workers
entering the labor force in the 1970s as the Baby Boom generation
reached maturity. Young, inexperienced workers were a drag on
productivity and competed with each other for jobs, holding down
wages.
   From 1949 to 1973, non-farm productivity, the amount of goods
and services turned out in an hour, rose 2.5 percent a year. Since
rising productivity provides the room for wages to grow without
fueling inflation, median family incomes roughly doubled during
this period.
   By contrast, productivity growth from 1974 through 1980 averaged
a mediocre 0.4 percent a year.
   In addition, salaries in the late 1970s were jolted by
double-digit inflation caused by oil-price increases. Then in the
mid-1980s, workers in American industries lost ground to stiff
foreign competition as the soaring value of the dollar opened the
country to a flood of imports and priced American products out of
overseas markets.
   Many economists see signs that these unfavorable trends are
being reversed. They predict better wage gains in the 1990s,
regardless of who wins the White House.
   For one thing, productivity in the 1980s has been rising 1.4
percent a year.
   And, the Labor Department estimates that for the rest of this
century the labor force will grow at less than half the pace of the
peak years of the 1970s when Baby Boomers flooded the job market.
   This will mean a return to the labor scarcity which helped boost
wages in the 1950s.
   The drop in oil prices has helped hold inflation down and a
decline in the value of the dollar since 1985 has helped revive
U.S. manufacturers.
   ``Labor market conditions are changing on a long-term basis,''
says William Cox, an Congressional Research Service economist. ``We
will see faster increases in real wages because labor is becoming
scarce.''
   But rosy predictions for the future haven't tempered the debate
over the past eight years.
   The Democrats note that, despite the longest peacetime economic
recovery on record, the number of persons living in poverty
remained frozen last year at 13.5 percent of the population,
compared to a poverty rate of 11.7 percent in the Carter year of
1979.
   Arguing the rich have gotten richer, they point to Census Bureau
statistics showing that the share of total income going to the
richest fifth of American families has increased to 43.7 percent in
1987, compared to 41.6 percent in 1980. The share of income going
to the poorest fifth has fallen to 4.6 percent in 1987, compared to
5.1 percent in 1980.
   With four years of economic growth since 1984 and unemployment
hovering near 14-year lows, Republicans say the pocketbook issues
voters care about, jobs and low inflation, are going to help the
GOP.
   ``This is really an argument over the question, `Are you better
off now than you were eight years ago?' The answer is very clear
that the average worker is indeed better off,'' said Marvin
Kosters, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise
Institute.
   Bluestone responds that Bush should be running away with the
election if the Republicans are right about the economy. But even
he sees a problem if the Democratic analysis is correct: ``Those
who have been hurt the most tend to vote the least.''

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting disappointment in
the slow pace of export sales despite a spurt of business on
Wednesday.
   The Agriculture Department's rejection this morning of China's
bid for 400,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat disappointed
traders and set the negative tone for early trading, analysts said.
   A number of smaller grain sales to foreign buyers were rumored
this morning but analysts said traders were getting fed up with
rumors.
   Most disappointing has been unsubstantiated talk of Soviet
purchases of U.S. grains and soybeans, said Steve Freed, a grain
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``We're being jacked around by rumors of Russians buying soybean
meal, Russians buying corn, and I think everybody's getting rumored
out,'' he said.
   Analysts said the grain markets probably will remain in the
doldrums until some really significant export business develops _
something like a new long-term grain agreement with the Soviet
Union.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.25{ a bushel; corn was {
cent lower to { cent higher with December at $2.90\ a bushel; oats
were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $2.58\ a
bushel; soybeans were 3} cents lower to 1 cent higher with November
at $8.05 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .13 cent higher with October at
72.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with October at 81.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent
lower to .13 cent higher with October at 39.70 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .02 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
February at 48.35 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Wednesday while pork futures
were mostly lower.

   Three foreign airlines have ordered a total of
five Boeing jets worth about $520 million.
   Qantas, the international airline of Australia, ordered two
747-400s costing an estimated $320 million, Boeing confirmed
Wednesday. Qantas now has eight of the latest 747 model on order,
with options on 17 more.
   Icelandair announced it has ordered two Boeing 757-200 jets
worth $100 million and taken an option on a third.
   Malaysia Airlines announced it ordered one 747-400, valued at
more than $120 million and scheduled for delivery in June 1990.
   Qantas currently has a fleet of 25 747s and eight 767s in
service.
   The two 747s, to be delivered in April and May 1990, will form
part of the airline's re-equipment program, which will nearly
double the airline's fleet over the next four years, Qantas
Chairman J.B. Leslie said.
   The 370-seat aircraft will fly routes to London and Frankfurt,
the airline said.
   The two planes ordered by Icelandair include spare parts and
crew training, and are to be delivered in February and March 1990,
Boeing Commercial Airplanes said. If Icelandair decides to take the
third jet, it would be delivered in 1991.
   Iceland's flag carrier said it plans to use the twinjets on its
routes from Reykjavik to New York City, Orlando, Fla., and various
European cities.
   Boeing has received orders for 370 757s, with 194 delivered so
far.
   Malaysia Airlines earlier ordered two 747-400 Combis, which can
carry a half-load of cargo on the main deck behind the passengers.
The new airplanes are to be used on routes between Malaysia and
Europe, Australia and the United States.
   Boeing has had orders for more than 500 commercial jets worth
$23.9 billion this year, a record for the industry.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AMR Corp. reported a 72.5 percent jump in its
third-quarter profit from a year earlier, which it attributed
mainly to strong growth in passenger traffic and yield.
   The parent of American Airlines said Wednesday that its net
income for the third quarter jumped to $150.3 million, or $2.50 a
share, from $87.1 million, or $1.41 a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 17.9 percent, to $2.33 billion from
$1.97 billion.
   American's yield, the amount of revenue per passenger mile,
increased by 9.9 percent from the third quarter of 1987. A
passenger mile represents one paying passenger flown one mile and
is used to determine an airline's capacity.
   ``Strong growth in both traffic and yield, coupled with
effective cost control and lower fuel prices, resulted in our best
third-quarter earnings ever,'' said AMR Chairman and President
Robert L. Crandall.
   In the first nine months of the year, AMR's net income rose to
$360.1 million, or $5.98 a share, from $199.2 million, or $3.30 a
share.
   Nine-month revenue rose 21.5 percent, to $6.46 billion from
$5.32 billion.

<DATELINE>LANDOVER, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert H. Haft, who with his father has
attempted takeovers of several major retail companies, has acquired
a minority interest in the Washington, D.C.-based Perpetual
Financial Corp.
   Haft, who purchased 5 percent of Perpetual's stock, said
Thursday, ``I believe the enterprise has a bright future. There's
nothing to the rumor that we've made an offer.''
   But the Washington Post reported that the Hafts, who own the
Landover, Md.-based Dart Corp., might make an offer of $16 a share
bid for Perpetual Financial. The concern is the holding company for
the Perpetual Savings Bank, the largest thrift in the Washington
area.
   Perpetual officials denied there had been a takeover attempt
from the Hafts, and senior vice president Robert A. Barton Jr. said
``I think someone just sits in an office and conjures up all types
of rumors. They're just absurd.''
   But speculation on the takeover rumors helped spark an advance
in Perpetual Financial stock prices on Wednesday. The stock closed
at $11 a share, up $1.25, on volume of nearly 877,000 shares.
   In the past the Hafts have submitted unsuccessful acquisition
bids for retailers such as Kroeger, Safeway Stores, Inc. and
Supermarkets General. They are currently negotiating to purchase
$15 million in stock in Walgreen Co., the nation's largest drug
store chain.

<HEAD>American Express Reports Decline In Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. on Thursday reported a 13
percent drop in its third-quarter earnings despite record results
in the divisions that run its credit card and financial services
businesses.
   The company attributed the decline to continued pinched profits
at its bank and brokerage firm, Shearson-Lehman Hutton Holdings
Inc., and to the fact that it restated year-ago earnings to reflect
deferred tax benefits.
   American Express said it netted $282.1 million, or 66 cents a
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, vs. revised earnings of
$324.1 million, or 74 cents a share in the comparable period last
year.
   Revenue during the period jumped 36 percent, to $5.71 billion
from $4.19 billion.
   For the first nine months of the year, American Express' profit
totaled $828.6 million, or $1.94 a share, on revenue of $16.67
billion. That was 30 percent higher than restated earnings of
$637.4 million, or $1.44 a share, and $12.94 billion in revenue, in
1987.
   American Express said it revised the 1987 results to include $76
million of tax-deferred benefits due to accounting changes in the
quarter and $198 million in the nine-month period.
   ``The dominant story for American Express is the consistent,
outstanding performance of Travel Related Services and IDS
Financial Services, which again posted record quarterly earnings,''
Chairman James D. Robinson III said in a statement.
   ``At the same time we remain confident that Shearson Lehman
Hutton and American Express Bank are well-positioned to rebound as
conditions in their markets improve.''
   At the Travel Related Services division, which runs the credit
card and travelers checks business, quarterly earnings climbed 18
percent to a record $221 million from $188 million. Revenue totaled
$1.9 billion, up 24 percent from last year.
   The company said its credit-card charge volume reached a
third-quarter record $22 billion, up 16 percent from 1987.
Travelers checks sales also rose.
   IDS Financial Services had a 17 percent jump in quarterly
earnings to a record $40 million from $34 million, American Express
said. The company said sales of securities, annuity and investment
certificates led the increase, but sales of mutual funds and life
insurance continued to fall.
   American Express Bank's earnings fell to $43 million in the
third quarter, compared with a $71 million profit last year, mainly
reflecting the fact that last year's profit was restated due to the
accounting changes. The company said earnings also suffered from
its ongoing program to reduce its exposure to troubled Third World
loans.
   American Express had reported Wednesday that Shearson Lehman's
third-quarter profit dropped 85 percent to $8.2 million from $54
million last year. It cited sluggish business following last year's
stock market crash, higher short-term interest rates and lagging
expenses from the purchase of E.F. Hutton Group Inc. a year ago.

   Time Inc. has tentatively agreed to buy a 50
percent interest in the privately held media concern Whittle
Communications LP, the companies announced today.
   The agreement in principle calls for Time, the magazine giant,
to make an initial payment of $185 million and potential additional
payments that depend on Whittle's growth through 1993, the
companies said in a statement.
   They said New York-based Time also would have options to
increase its ownership.
   Completion of the deal is subject to negotiation of definitive
agreements and any required approvals, the statement said.
   Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., has grown rapidly in recent
years by concentrating on developing media vehicles such as
magazines and sponsored posters that are aimed at reaching targeted
audiences, such as people at school and or in doctor's offices.
   A matchup between Whittle and Time would be somewhat ironic
since Whittle took great delight in recent months in tweaking the
nose of the magazine publishing establishment as it launched a new
magazine, Special Reports.
   Special Reports is a package of six magazines that are designed
specifically for doctor's waiting rooms. The magazines appear
quarterly and each is focused on areas such as Family, Health,
Sports and Personalities.
   But Whittle angered many in the magazine business when it went
after advertisers by telling them that the doctors who took the
magazines into their waiting rooms would stock no more than two
other magazines.
   That provision, along with the right to be the only advertiser
in the magazines in specific product categories, was designed to
help the sponsors cut through the commercial clutter and have their
messages stand out.
   Whittle Chairman Chris Whittle announced last month as the first
editions were being distributed to more than 16,500 doctors'
offices that advertising space was sold out for two years. He said
advertisers had committed to spend $80 million and claimed it was
one of the most successful magazine launches ever.
   Time is involved in publishing 23 magazines either by itself or
through partnerships or joint ventures.
   It is in a joint venture with Dale Lang, for instance, that
publishes the magazines McCall's, Working Woman, Working Mother and
Baby.
   In addition to Special Reports, Whittle offers about 40 other
media properties that advertisers can use to reach consumers.
   It puts up sponsored wallboards that it calls information
centers in places such as high schools or hospitals, publishes
newsletters and offers sampling programs. Whittle has said he is
interested in getting into book publishing and television.
   The privately-held company employs 900 people, recorded revenues
of $105 million in the year that ended in June and expects revenues
of $150 million for the year that ends in June 1989.
   Time, which also has interests in book publishing and cable
television, earned $231 million, or $4 a share, on revenue of $3.3
billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30.

<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. announced today that top
managers are considering offering to buy the consumer-products
giant for almost $17 billion, a deal that would be the largest
corporate acquisition ever.
   The announcement of a possible $75-a-share offer for the firm
that manufactures Oreo cookies and Winston cigarettes underscored
the soaring interest in food companies and well-known brand names.
It came just three days after Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered to
buy processed foods manufacturer Kraft Inc. for $11 billion and two
days after Pillsbury Co. rejected a $5.23 billion bid from the
British firm Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Wall Street apparently expected a higher offer for RJR Nabisco.
The company's stock surged higher after the news broke, climbing
$19.75 a share to $75.62{ in New York Stock Exchange trading. More
than 5.6 million shares had been traded by early afternoon, making
it the most active stock on the Big Board.
   RJR Nabisco said President F. Ross Johnson and Edward A.
Horrigan Jr., chief executive of the company's tobacco business,
had notified Nabisco that they ``intend to seek to develop, with a
financial partner, a proposal to acquire RJR Nabisco in a leveraged
buyout merger transaction.''
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. later confirmed it was the financial
partner and was providing equity financing and advice to the
management group.
   ``Any proposal, if made, would be reviewed by a special
committee composed of outside directors which has been established
by the board,'' RJR Nabisco said in a statement.
   The group said they estimated they would offer $75 in cash for
each of the company's approximately 225 million common shares
outstanding.
   In a leveraged buyout, the buyer borrows the money to buy the
company, then pay off the debt either through company revenue or
selling off parts of the operation.
   If such a deal were completed, it would be the biggest leveraged
buyout of an American corporation by far. The biggest LBO was the
$6.1 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos. by an investment group led by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in 1986.
   It also would surpass the biggest corporate acquisition, the
$13.4 billion purchase of Gulf Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.
   One Wall Street analyst, Pavlos Alexandrakis of Argus Research
Corp., said a $75-a-share bid would be low.
   ``Valuing Nabisco, as a food company and discounting the tobacco
operation, I arrive at a value somewhere between $85 and $90,'' he
said.
   RJR Nabisco was formed when the tobacco company R.J. Reynolds
Industries Inc. bought Nabisco Brands Inc., the food and consumer
products giant, for $4.9 billion in 1985.
   The company's products are some of the best-known in the
country, and also include Ritz crackers, Camel and Salem
cigarettes, Del Monte vegetables and Milk-Bone dog biscuits.
   It is currently test-marketing a smokeless cigarette, Premier.
   RJR Nabisco had 1987 profits of $1.18 billion on sales of $15.77
billion. Food products accounted for 59.7 percent of the company's
revenue, while tobacco products brought in 40.3 percent of its
sales.
   Earlier this year, the company announced a reorganization of its
food business, separating its biscuit and grocery foods divisions
into two free-standing operating companies. RJR Nabisco said the
move would make it more responsive to changes in the marketplace.
   In the past few years, the company has sold off divisions that
did not fit with its long-range plans, including Kentucky Fried
Chicken.
   Philip Morris, which like RJR Nabisco has tobacco and food
businesses, offered to buy Kraft for $90 a share or a total of $11
billion. Kraft said it was studying the offer and expected to make
a recommendation to its shareholders by Oct. 31.
   Wall Street analysts said it would be difficult for Kraft to
turn down the Philip Morris bid.
   Pillsbury said Grand Metropolitan's $60-a-share offer was
inadequate, and that it was exploring options in response to the
bid.

   Share prices finished an uneven session on the
London Stock Exchange slightly higher Thursday after a late
afternoon rally.
   There was selective buying of stocks that have lately been in
the limelight of takeover speculation.
   The FT-SE 100-share index closed 1.8 points, or 10 percent,
higher at 1,864.3, its best level for the day.
   Dealers said activity on Wall Street provided little leadership
for London equities, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up
6.76 points at 2,144.03 during the London afternoon.
   The market continued to focus on corporate news, including the
Elders-Scottish and Newcastle, and Minorco-Consolidated Gold Fields
takeover battles.
   Heavy trading in Lonrho kept market players guessing.
   Lonrho, the market's most active stock in recent weeks, saw
continued heavy volume Thursday, with 29 million shares traded by
the close. Lonrho was up 5 at 379.

<HEAD>Political-Economic Confusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While politics and economics are entwined
inextricably, they are hardly supportive of each other.
   They speak different languages; they communicate differently.
   Political practitioners often take great liberties with the
facts, and so confuse voters. But economists create equal confusion
by concentrating on esoteric data that mean nothing to anyone.
   They cannot live without each other but they live poorly
together.
   Economic thinkers complain that practical politicians distort
sound economic ideas. Political thinkers say economists don't
understand the real world.
   The relationship is sometimes even destructive.
   Politicians often are misled by faulty economic advice.
President Gerald Ford, for instance, launched a campaign to fight
inflation when inflation was waning and recession was becoming the
big problem.
   And it is also true that economists may be damaged by
politicians. The former, it is often said, lose their objectivity
on the day they accept a political appointment. Some cannot return
to their old academic jobs.
   Americans are now getting a wretched dose of this fractious
relationship as the two presidential candidates expel figures and
``facts'' that cannot be understood, are out of context or cannot
be verified.
   As a consequence, it is nearly impossible to determine the
economic state of the United States from the political platforms or
performances.
   Here are some of the broader gauges, and a middle-of-the-road
assessment:
   _The gross national product, broadest indicator of economic
strength or weakness, rose from $4.24 trillion in 1986 to $4.5
trillion in 1987 and will reach a projected $4.86 trillion in 1988.
   Assessment: Steady, moderate growth. Anything stronger might
mean inflation; weaker growth might be equally unacceptable, with a
pervasive threat of recession.
   _The federal deficit averaged about $144 billion in the fiscal
year ended Sept. 30, a sizeable improvement from deficits of $213
billion in 1986 and $163 billion in 1987.
   Assessment: They are still horrendously high. Moreover, it is
still uncertain that the underlying problems have been resolved or
that the trend to improvement will continue.
   _The trade deficit is running at a rate of less than $100
billion, its lowest since the winter of 1985.
   Assessment: It, too, remains extremely high, with no certainty
that the improvement will continue. American exports, particularly
of manufactured goods, have been improving, but imports surged
recently.
   _Inflation, using the gross national product as a base, has been
rising _ from 2.7 percent in 1986 to 3.3 percent in 1987 and a bit
more than that in 1988.
   Assessment: Rising inflation is always a threat, and many
economists fear it is a major one in 1989. But earlier worries
about inflation have been overdone.
   Moreover, the strongest inflation is in the consumer rather than
producing sectors. Manufacturing competition, now firmly on a
global scale, is keeping those price increases relatively low.
   _Employment has been rising steadily, from 109.6 million in 1986
to 112.4 million in 1987 to perhaps 115 million in 1988.
Unemployment has been dropping, from 7 percent in 1986 to 6.2
percent in 1987 to about 5.5 percent this year.
   Assessment: Strong figures, but potentially an economic threat.
Fears exist that the falling jobless rate eventually will put
upward pressure on prices.
   So far, however, there is little evidence that any such process
has begun. Wages, in fact, have been unusually steady. Discounted
for inflation, income has grown, but so has production. So far, it
isn't an inflation scenario.
   _The consensus of forecasters seems to be that prospects for
recession in 1989 are slim, at least in the first half of the year.
   Assessment: Such forecasts are good for six months, less so for
a year, and perhaps meangingless beyond that. No good economist
these days will ever make a forecast without citing the possibility
of recession within a couple of years.
   The reason for this is simply that the economic expansion has
gone on for six years, well beyond expectations, and therefore may
be vulnerable some time soon. Again, strong statistical evidence of
recession hasn't shown up yet.

   The state Supreme Court today rebuffed
Attorney General John Van de Kamp's challenge to the $10.1 billion
buyout of Getty Oil Co. by Texaco in 1984, ruling that California
antitrust law cannot be used against mergers.
   Van de Kamp had argued that the merger, then the second largest
in U.S. history, would drive up gasoline prices in California by
tying up Getty's abundant oil supplies and San Joaquin Valley
pipeline, a major source for low-priced independent oil firms.
   Rejected by state courts in attempts to block the merger in
1984, Van de Kamp sought at least to require court orders making
the former Getty supplies available to independents after 1989,
when a Federal Trade Commission order expires.
   It was the first time a California attorney general had ever
tried to use state antitrust law against mergers.
   But the court ruled 4-3 that California's 1907 antitrust law,
the Cartwright Act, which prohibits any ``combination of capital''
that might affect prices, did not apply to mergers.
   The opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas said the term
``combination of capital'' was intended to apply only to business
dealings between two companies that maintained separate identities,
and not to a purchase of one company by another.
   The California law was modeled after antitrust statutes in
Michigan and Texas that had been interpreted by courts in 1899 and
1904 not to apply to mergers, Lucas said. He said the California
Legislature, presumably aware of those rulings, had amended the law
26 times since 1907 and had never added anti-merger language.
   The ruling does not appear to affect Van de Kamp's separate
challenge to the merger of Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarkets, a
suit that relies on federal law. Van de Kamp is one of several
state attorneys general who have tried to activate state antitrust
enforcement in light of the Reagan administration's reluctance to
challenge mergers.
   In an 89-page dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk said California
antitrust law could be used against mergers, even those allowed by
the federal government.
   The Reagan administration ``has all but ceased enforcing the
federal antitrust laws as they apply to mergers,'' Mosk said,
citing a study that said the Justice Department had contested only
26 out of over 10,000 merger applications between 1981 and 1986.
   ``...Vigorous enforcement of state antitrust laws is plainly
necessary.''
   As state attorney general from 1959 to 1964, Mosk established an
antitrust division in his office and was the first to enforce state
antitrust laws extensively.
   The Texaco-Getty merger was approved by the FTC with conditions
requiring Texaco to make oil available to independent firms through
1989. The federal agency assumed that the independents would be
well-supplied after that with offshore oil.
   But Van de Kamp said in his suit that the protections were
inadequate, arguing that offshore oil supplies were uncertain and
were generally controlled by major refiners that would not supply
independent companies.
   He contended that neither federal antitrust law nor the FTC
order was intended to prohibit states from using their own
antitrust laws to attack anticompetitive effects of a merger in a
state such as California, where half to two-thirds of Getty's
assets were located.
   The majority in today's ruling, consisting of Lucas and Justices
David Eagleson, Edward Panelli and John Arguelles, concluded that
California law does not authorize a state challenge to a merger and
did not discuss whether federal approval of the merger would
prohibit any state intervention.
   Mosk, joined in dissent by Justices Allen Broussard and Marcus
Kaufman, said ``combination of capital'' was a broad term that
applied to mergers as well as anticompetitive agreements between
independent companies.
   That interpretation is consistent with the main goal of
antitrust law, consumer protection, and was accepted by a state
appeals court as early as 1915, leaving the Legislature with no
need to amend the law, Mosk said.
   Mosk also said the FTC order approving the merger did not
prohibit a state from taking additional steps that are consistent
with the goals of promoting competition and protecting consumers.
He said the remedies sought by Van de Kamp, such as separate
management by Texaco of the former Getty property and post-1989
orders guaranteeing oil supplies to independents, did not conflict
with the FTC decision.

   The stock market turned upward today, rebounding
from Wednesday's drop.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 22.58 points on
Wednesday, rose 14.05 to 2,151.32 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 5 to 3 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 878 up, 488
down and 572 unchanged.
   The market was unsettled Wednesday by rising interest rates and
a rumor that a major newspaper was about to publish a story
potentially hurting the presidential campaign of Vice President
Bush. The rumor was quickly denied, however.
   Analysts said buying was encouraged today by abundant takeover
news and rumors, which create opportunities for quick trading
profits.
   In the newest development on that front, RJR Nabisco soared 20[
to 76 on word that a management group may propose to buy out the
company for about $75 a share.

Olympic Pipeline Co. to Sohio Oil Co. for $152.5 million, plus
crude and product inventories.
   Mobil also said is has agreed to exchange about 240 Mobil

   Sohio, a subsidiary of BP America, is a major producer of
Alaskan North Slope crude and owns 50 percent of Trans Alaska

   ITT Corp., a diversified company with interests
in defense technology and insurance, on Thursday reported a 20
percent gain in third-quarter earnings over a year ago.
   Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $230
million, or $1.60 a share, compared with restated profit of $192
million, or $1.27 a share, in the same period in 1987. Revenue was
up 9 percent, to $5.2 billion from $4.8 billion.
   The quarterly results included a one-time gain of $12 million
for tax benefits related to its Hartford Insurance Group. Last year
ITT took a $16 million charge for disposing of several investments.
   For the first nine months, ITT netted $637 million, or $4.44 per
share, compared with restated earnings of $544 million, or $3.57 a
share, in the same period last year.
   The company said the 1987 results reflected a $67 million
one-time charge in the first quarter due to an accounting change at
ITT Defense Technology. They also included a $28 million gain on
the sale of Virgin Islands Telephone Corp.
   Revenue for the first nine months rose 9 percent, to $15.5
billion from $14.3 billion in 1987.

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. today reported record
profit and sales for the third quarter, leading company officials
to predict 1988 would be the company's best ever.
   Len Kuchan, treasurer of the Peoria-based Caterpillar, said
profit during the last three months were an unprecedented $190
million, or $1.87 per share, up 30 percent from $146 million, or
$1.47 per share, in the year-ago period.
   Sales for the quarter were $2.74 billion, up 22 percent from
$2.25 billion in the same period of 1987.
   It is the sixth consecutive quarter of profitmaking for
Peoria-based Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of
earth-moving equipment, the company said. The company has reported
record sales in the last two quarters.
   ``We're pleased but this certainly does not call for
celebrating,'' Kuchan said. ``Our costs continue to be higher than
we'd like. Our profit levels are not as high as they should be
based on these sales figures.
   ``It is good news for Caterpillar, all our employees and our
community. We're going to have a good year.''
   For the first nine months of 1988, Caterpillar reported
after-tax profit of $453 million, or $4.46 a share, up about 150
percent from $180 million in the same 1987 period. Revenue was $7.6
billion vs. $5.9 billion in the nine-month period of 1987, a 28.8
percent gain.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Close Down Sharply; Grains Also Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices collapsed Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade and closed at their lowest levels since late
July on a combination of bearish fundamental and technical factors.
   Most grain futures also closed lower.
   Soybeans opened mostly lower in sympathy with the wheat market,
which was pressured by disappointment over the Agriculture
Department's rejection of China's bid for 400,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat.
   But soybean selling accelerated steadily, fueled first by news
of heavy beneficial rains in a major soybean-growing area of Brazil
and later by bearish technical signals as the price for November
delivery of soybeans broke key support levels at $8 and $7.88 a
bushel.
   ``From there it was Katie bar the door,'' said Joel Karlin,
research analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   The November contract closed at $7.84 a bushel, the lowest
soybean price on the Board of Trade since July 26.
   Rumors late in the session that the Soviet Union had purchased
200,000 metric tons of soybean meal from Argentina added to the
selling pressure, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.23{ a bushel; corn was 4}
cents lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.86 a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 3{ cents lower with December at $2.54} a bushel;
soybeans were 10 cents to 22{ cents lower with November at $7.84 a

<HEAD>Bank America's Profit Soars, Bank of Bost Has Moderate Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp., the nation's third-largest banking company,
reported Thursday that its third-quarter profit more than tripled
from a year ago, while 13th ranked Bank of Boston Corp. had a 7
percent earnings increase.
   A.W. Clausen, chairman of BankAmerica, credited the San
Francisco company's quarterly profit to growth in net interest
income, reduced operating expenses and low net credit losses.
   Bank of Boston Chief Executive Officer Ira Stephanian said his
company also had higher net interest income as well as venture
capital profits but they largely were offset by higher non-interest
expenses.
   BankAmerica reported third-quarter net income of $190 million,
or 97 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared
to $54 million, or 25 cents per share, last year. For the nine
months net income totaled $461 million, or $2.40 per share, vs. a
$1 billion loss last year, when the company increased its loan-loss
reserves to cover shaky Third World debt.
   Bank of Boston Corp. said it netted $79 million, or $1.14 a
share, in the quarter, compared with earnings of $74 million, or
$1.09 a share, last year. Its nine-month profit was $240 million,
or $3.47 a share, up from $61 million, or 80 cents.
   BankAmerica's $190 million profit represents the once-troubled
banking giant's fifth straight quarterly gain. From the end of 1984
through the end of 1987, BankAmerica lost a total $1.85 billion.
During that span, BankAmerica dropped from being the top bank in
the nation to the No. 3 spot behind Citicorp and Chase Manhattan
Corp.
   BankAmerica said quarterly profit would have been $14 million
higher had it not placed $394 million of its $492 million Argentina
loan portfolio on a non-accrual basis, meaning it would record
interest payments only when received instead of when due.
   Bank of Boston said its nine-month profit from a year ago
reflected a $300 million increase in its Third World loan-loss
reserves. During that period this year the provision totaled $108
million, compared to $395 million last year.

<HEAD>Zenith Posts 3rd Quarter Profit; Profitable Year Predicted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. said Thursday it
returned to profitability in the third quarter and the company's
chairman predicted the beleaguered firm would show a year-end
pre-tax profit for the first time since 1984.
   For the three-month period ended Oct. 1, Zenith's after-tax
profit totaled $3 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with a net
loss of $25.1 million, or 99 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
   It marked the company's first quarterly profit since the fourth
quarter of 1987 and came as a relief to Zenith officials, who are
battling a takeover bid by dissident shareholders.
   Third-quarter sales climbed 15 percent to $682 million from $592
million.
   ``We are delighted that we have returned to the black, albeit a
small black,'' Jerry K. Pearlman, Zenith's chairman and president
told a news conference following the release of the third-quarter
results.
   The results included a gain of $2.6 million from the sale of
property, including unused factory space, warehouses and vacant
land, Pearlman said.
   For the first nine months, Zenith reported a loss of $8.7
million, or 34 cents a share, compared with a loss of $23.8
million, or 99 cents a share, in the same 1987 period. Revenue for
the nine-month period were $1.85 billion, compared with $1.68
billion in 1987.
   Pearlman said cost-cutting measures had enabled Zenith _ the
only company still manufacturing televisions in the United States _
to lower prices on its televisions, video-cassette recorders and
other consumer electronics to levels competitive with imports.
   He said certain Zenith televisions and less expensive VCRs were
in such high demand that the company had fallen behind in filling
orders.
   While others in the industry have announced their intentions to
raise TV prices, ``we've already implemented selective TV and VCR
price increases that, if they hold, should help fourth-quarter
profitability,'' Pearlman said.
   Zenith is battling its largest shareholder, New York-based
Brookhurst Partners L.P., for control of the company. Last week,
Brookhurst launched a consent solicitation, which is similar to a
proxy vote, seeking shareholder approval for its plan to gain
control of Zenith's board of directors and sell the company.
   Pearlman said the cost of fighting Brookhurst had disrupted
Zenith's own efforts to improve the performance of its consumer
electronics division through some kind of arrangement with other
companies.
   Because of the consent solicitation, Pearlman also tempered his
rosy forecasts for fourth quarter and year-end results with a
warning, required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, that
the predictions were based on his best understanding of the
situation and might not come true in case of an unexpected setback.
   Brookhurst's consent solicitation ends on Dec. 4.
   Zenith's third-quarter sales of computer systems and components
increased 17 percent to $392 million while sales of consumer
electronics, the division that is the source of Zenith's financial
problems, advanced 13 percent to $290 million.

<HEAD>Verity: Trade Deficit ``Cancer'' On Society</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity
said Thursday the U.S. trade deficit is a ``cancer on this
society'' and urged the United States to attack its $57 billion
deficit with Japan by exporting more.
   But he told business leaders from Japan and the governors of
seven Southeastern states that changes in the Japanese distribution
system are also needed to help in the effort.
   Verity spoke to the joint meetings of the Southeast United
States-Japan Association and its Japanese counterpart, the
Japan-Southeast United States Association. The groups work to
foster better business ties between Japan and the Southeast.
   Speaking with reporters later, Verity said ``if we're going to
reduce the trade imbalance, we have to increase exports to Japan.
I'm convinced we can ease that trade imbalance in the next three to
four years.''
   Verity called the deficit ``a cancer on this society'' and
warned ``American producers will not be able to survive as long as
they only depend on the U.S. market.''
   Asked about Democrat Michael Dukakis' prediction that he will
eliminate the trade deficit in four years, Verity said the only way
that could be done is by putting up trade barriers or by a
recession.
   Verity said the American people don't want either and are
willing to see a gradual cut in the trade deficit as exports grow.
   During his speech, Verity noted progress has been made in easing
the trade imbalance with recent agreements that allow American
companies more access to Japanese construction projects and the new
Omnibus Trade Bill.
   He said the measure should not cause any problem for trade
between the two nations.
   ``It will be administered in a very enlightened way and Japan
has nothing to fear from that trade bill,'' he said.
   To ease the trade deficit, he said, steps need to be taken to
change the old Japanese product distribution system _ a system
which, for imports ``often double or triples the price of the
product before it gets to the consumer.''
   Verity, a resident of Beaufort, S.C., said a recent trade
mission to Japan showed that there are markets there for top
quality American goods.
   He said while the United States welcomes Japanese investment
which creates jobs, the United States must export more.
   Meanwhile, the Southeast continues to be a fertile ground for
Japanese investment in this nation.
   As of August, Japanese investment in the seven-state region of
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Tennessee and Virginia totaled $5.2 billion.
   There are 478 Japanese-owned countries in the region which have
created a total of 8,085 jobs.

<HEAD>TWA Pilots Withdraw Request for Injunction Against Icahn Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilots union at Trans World Airlines Inc. on
Thursday withdrew its legal petition for an immediate injunction
blocking Chairman Carl Icahn's plan to take the airline private.
   The pilots retained their lawsuit against Icahn's privatization
scheme, however.
   The pilots' withdrawal of the petition, which came at a
preliminary hearing before New York State Supreme Court Judge
Michael J. Dontzin, was in return for a guarantee that Icahn gave
at the hearing. The financier promised that, if the pilots' lawsuit
against his plan is decided in their favor, he would reinvest in
the airline around $470 million that he originally planned to take
out of it.
   A trial on the pilots' lawsuit has been scheduled for the first
week of December.
   In addition, the union representing TWA flight attendants has
asked the Department of Transportation to block the privatization
and freeze the airline's assets while it investigates Icahn's
fitness to continue managing TWA.
   The TWA pilots union joined the flight attendants' petition
about two weeks ago.
   ``Until our concerns are resolved, we have to press forward with
all the avenues we can,'' said Kent Scott, vice chairman of the TWA
pilots union in St. Louis.
   The Consumer Federation of America has filed a similar petition.
   Joan Wages, a spokeswoman in New York for the TWA flight
attendants union, said the group's petition to the DOT will remain
active following Icahn's guarantee and the pilots' move.
   ``We're very pleased about that,'' Ms. Wages said, referring to
Icahn's commitment.
   The TWA chairman, who now owns around 77 percent of TWA's 30.5
million common shares outstanding, won approval from shareholders
in early September for his privatization plan.
   The airline said Thursday it expects the transaction to be
completed on Oct. 24.
   Under the plan, Icahn and the financial entities controlled by
him would own about 90 percent of TWA's stock, while the remaining
shares would be held by an employee stock ownership plan.
   Airline industry analysts estimate the bid puts a value of
around $40 a share, or $304.8 million, on the TWA shares that Icahn
does not already own.
   Icahn recently broke off efforts to acquire ailing Eastern
Airlines, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., after failing to
structure a deal that would satisfy the carrier's unions.

   Dow Jones & Co. said Thursday that its president
and chief operating officer of nine years, Ray Shaw, has decided to
take early retirement next spring for personal reasons.
   The company, which publishes the Wall Street Journal and
operates the Dow Jones News Service, said Chairman Warren H.
Phillips will serve as president after Shaw's retirement March 31.
   Phillips had held both titles prior to Shaw's appointment as
president in 1979.
   Shaw, 54, joined the Journal in 1960, serving as a reporter and
editor before becoming the founding managing editor of AP-Dow
Jones, an international news service operated jointly with The
Associated Press.
   Shaw oversaw the launch of Dow Jones' electronic publishing unit
in the early 1970s and later was responsible for the business
operations of the Journal, Barron's magazine and the news services.
He was named executive vice president of Dow Jones in 1977 and
president and chief operating officer two years later.
   Shaw said his decision to retire was ``totally for personal and
family reasons.''
   ``There were no corporate considerations involved in my
decision,'' he said in a statement.
   Dow Jones said that Shaw's wife and three children have been
living and working in North Carolina for several years and he has
been commuting there on weekends.
   Phillips said Shaw ``has played a major role in setting the
company's course, and has been responsible for many of Dow Jones'
most successful ventures. He would have been in line for even
greater responsibilities and recognition in the future.''

   Holiday Corp., a leading hotel and casino

<HEAD>Haft Elected To Perpetual Board; Acquires 5 Percent Of Perpetual
Stock</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS Townsend's first name in lede.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert M. Haft, who has attempted takeovers of
several major retail companies, and Ronald Townsend, president of a
Gannett-owned television station, were elected to the Board of
Directors of the Washington, D.C.-based Perpetual Financial Corp.
on Thursday.
   The Haft family has acquired nearly 5 percent of stock in
Perpetual, said family spokesman Stanley Rubenstein.
   But Rubenstein denied a report that Haft planned to make a $16 a
share bid to acquire the holding company for the area's largest
thrift.
   ``There was a rumor that somebody was circulating in the
Washington area that the Hafts had made an offer, and that is
absolutely not true,'' Rubenstein said. The rumor sparked a rally
of the company's stock Wednesday.
   Haft, who is president of Crown Books, Trak Auto and Dart Group,
was not available to comment.
   In the past, the Hafts have submitted unsuccessful acquisition
bids for retailers such as Kroeger, Safeway Stores, Inc., and
Supermarkets General. They are currently negotiating to purchase
$15 million in stock in Walgreen Co., the nation's largest drug
store chain.
   Townsend is the president and general manager of WUSA Channel 9,
the Gannett-owned CBS affiliate in Washington.
   Perpetual senior vice president Robert A. Barton Jr. said Haft
and Townsend were elected to the 12-member board Thursday morning
``because of their visibility in the community.'' The new members
will serve for terms of up to three years.
   Perpetual Financial Corp., with assets of $5.6 billion, is the
holding company for Perpetual Savings Bank, F.S.B., the largest
thrift in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia.

<HEAD>Kodak In Snowmaking Product Deal With Mitsubishi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Eastman Kodak Co. subsidiary that
sells an innovative snowmaking aid announced an agreement Thursday
with Mitsubishi Corp. that gives the Japanese company all rights to
sell the product in Japan.
   The snowmaking aid, called Snomax, is a protein that, when
dissolved in water, allows snowflakes to form in water that's eight
to 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than freezing.
   It's in use by more than 150 ski resorts around the country and
in Canada, and was used at the winter Olympic Games in Calgary
earlier this year.
   Snowmax technologies, the Kodak subsidiary, has also started
marketing it in various European countries as well as in Australia.
   Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
   Mitsubishi, through its subsidiary Kashiyama Kyogo Ltd., a
leading manufacturer of snowmaking equipment, will be trying to
sell Snowmax to more than 600 ski resorts in Japan.
   ``Although only slightly more than a hundred ski resorts in that
country currently have artificial snowmaking capability, the
capability, and thus the market, is expanding rapidly,'' said
Edward Robinson, president of Snowmax Technologies.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burlington Northern Inc.'s board of directors has
approved the spin-off of its energy and natural resources holdings,
Burlington Resources Inc., to company shareholders, the railroad
holding company announced Thursday.
   New executive officers also were named for both companies.
   Burlington Northern said it would distribute 130 million shares,
or 87 percent of Burlington Resources on Dec. 31 to shareholders of
record on Dec. 16. Each shareholder will receive 1.74 shares of
Burlington Resources for each share they hold of Burlington
Northern.
   About 13 percent, or 20 million shares, of Burlington Resources
common stock was sold in a public offering July 7 at $25.50 a share.
   Burlington Northern announced in June the creation of the new
company, made up of Meridian Oil Co., El Paso Natural Gas Co., Plum
Creek Timber Co., Meridian Minerals Co. and Glacier Park Co., a
real estate concern.
   Burlington Northern's principle company remains Burlington
Northern Railroad, which operates a 23,500-mile rail system in 19
Western states and two Canadian provinces.
   Burlington Northern announced earlier this month that it was
moving its headquarters from Seattle to Fort Worth, Texas.
Burlington Resources will remain based here.
   The company announced that Thomas H. O'Leary, currently a vice
president of both companies, will become president and chief
executive officer of Burlington Resources. Gerald Grinstein,
currently vice chairman of both companies, will become president
and chief executive officer of Burlington Northern. Both
appointments will take effect Jan. 1.
   Richard M. Bressler will continue as chairman of the board of
both companies. He currently is chairman, chief executive officer
and president of both.

   Textron Inc. said Thursday a strike at
its Lycoming turbine engine division kept third-quarter operating
income nearly flat, but lower taxes enabled it to post a 14 percent
increase in profit, compared with 1987.
   The company reported net income from continuing operations for
the quarter ended Sept. 30 of $62.8 million, or 72 cents per share,
compared with $55.1 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago
quarter. Revenue was $1.73 billion, up from $1.72 billion in the
same quarter in 1987.
   ``The seven-week strike at our Lycoming turbine engine division,
settled in July, adversely affected results in both the second and
third quarters,'' B.F. Dolan, Textron chairman, president and chief
executive, said in a prepared statement. ``However, we anticipate
that we will achieve our financial targets for the full year.''
   Lycoming headquarters and its main plant are in Stratford, Conn.
   For the first nine months, Textron reported a 17 percent decline
in after-tax profit to $170.4 million from $206.3 million in the
same 1987 period. Revenue was $5.36 billion vs. $5.38 billion in
the year-ago period.
   Textron has subsidiaries in aerospace technology, commercial
products and finance.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips In Lackluster Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Precede LONDON BC</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar slipped toward the lower end of its
recent trading range in light foreign exchange dealings Thursday.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Analysts said many traders here and overseas were bearish on the
dollar, but few appeared willing to press the currency below its
recent support levels of 1.80 West German marks and 125 Japanese
yen.
   The market has been stuck in a narrow range near those levels in
anticipation of the November elections.
   ``It's as though people want to sell (dollars), but they're not
totally convinced,'' said Stephen Leach, currency analyst for
Chemical Bank.
   Traders said there was a brief attempt to take the dollar higher
near the close of European trading, but the effort dissipated as
activity shifted to New York.
   Among the factors dragging the dollar down in domestic trading
were softer oil prices, which fell amid renewed pessimism about
OPEC's ability to agree on production limits.
   Rumors that Iran would refuse to join other cartel members in
cutting production surfaced at committee meetings of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries under way in Madrid,
Spain.
   In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar closed at
127.15 yen, up 0.30 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 126.90
yen. In New York, the dollar dipped to 127.10 yen, from 127.385
late Wednesday.
   The dollar rose against the British pound in London, where it
cost $1.7335 to buy one pound, compared with $1.7515 late
Wednesday. But in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.7636 in late
trading, more expensive than $1.75175 Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, were: 1.80075 West German marks, down from 1.81195;
1.52325 Swiss francs, down from 1.5312; 1.20095 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.19945; 6.15275 French francs, down from 6.1905; and
1,342.00 Italian lire, down from 1,348.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8005 West German marks, down from
1.8115; 1.5210 Swiss francs, down from 1.5275; 6.1630 French
francs, down from 6.1710; 2.0320 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0380;
1,341.50 Italian lire, down from 1,347.625; 1.1982 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.19955.
   In gold trading, Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$410.90 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, down from $411.80 late
Wednesday.
   At the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery fetched $412.20 a troy ounce, up from $411.40 late
Wednesday.
   Elsewhere, gold rose in London to a late bid price of $412 a
troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $411.05. In Zurich, gold
was higher, closing at a bid $411.50 compared with $410.00 late
Wednesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.56 to close at a bid
$414.49.
   Silver bullion for current delivery was quoted at $6.342 a troy
ounce at the Comex, up from $6.337 late Wednesday. Silver bullion
prices were unchanged in London, where the metal was trading at a
late bid price of $6.35 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   New York Times Co. reported Thursday an 18 percent decline in
third-quarter profit from a year earlier, due largely to lower
advertising volume at its flagship newspaper The New York Times,
while Times Mirror Co.'s profit rose 14 percent.
   The New York-based publishing company said its net income for
the third quarter fell to $26.7 million, or 33 cents a share, from
$32.6 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue declined to $404.1 million from $406.4
million.
   Advertising linage at The Times was down 8 percent from the
third quarter of 1987, the company said. It also blamed the profit
decline on costs stemming from The Times's expanded national
editions introduced in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
   In addition, higher newsprint prices and costs related to a new
weekly television magazine at The Times also trimmed profit, the
company said.
   Despite the downward trend, Chairman Arthur Ochs Sulzberger
said, the company still expects the year as a whole to show
improvement over 1987.
   In the first nine months of the year, net income slipped to
$117.2 million, or $1.44 a share, from $117.8 million, or $1.44 a
share.
   The decline occurred despite a rise in nine-month revenue, to
$1.3 billion from $1.2 billion.
   Times Mirror, based in Los Angeles, said the 14 percent rise in
its third-quarter profit was due mainly to the sale of timber lands
and the Times Mirror Press.
   The company which publishes the Los Angeles Times, Newsday and
the Baltimore Sun, said it netted $80.9 million, or 62 cents a
share, up from $70.6 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 4.8 percent, to $814.8 million from
$777.5 million.
   The sale of the timber lands and Times Mirror Press boosted
revenues that were declining because of lost advertising dollars,
the company said.
   Strong revenues from the company's professional publishing
businesses and cable television operations also helped offset
declines in newspaper publishing and broadcast TV, Times Mirror
said.

<TEXT>
   Food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc. said
Thursday some of its top executives were considering taking the
company private in a leveraged buyout, which, at nearly $17
billion, would be the largest corporate acquisition in history.
   The company, known for products that include Camel and Winston
cigarettes, Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, also announced a 10.9
percent increase in its third-quarter income.
   The morning announcement of the possible $75-a-share offer _
which came in the midst of takeover activity involving other big
food companies _ sent RJR Nabisco's stock price soaring, but it
also left investment analysts puzzled about the purpose and price
of the proposal.
   RJR Nabisco said President F. Ross Johnson and Edward A.
Horrigan Jr., chief executive of the company's tobacco business,
had notified the firm they ``intend to seek to develop, with a
financial partner, a proposal to acquire RJR Nabisco in a leveraged
buyout merger transaction.''
   The company said the group was considering offering about $75 in
cash for each of the company's approximately 225 million common
shares outstanding, making the proposal worth about $16.88 billion.
   The company said late Thursday the offer will be reviewed by a
special committee of outside directors led by Chairman Charles E.
Hugel. The committee has retained investment bankers Dillon Read &
Co. Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. Inc. to advise it.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said it was advising the management
group and would provide equity and financing for the deal.
   Analysts said the proposal was too low, and investors apparently
agreed. RJR Nabisco stock surged $21.37{ a share to $77.25 on the
New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most actively traded
issue.
   ``Valuing Nabisco, as a food company and discounting the tobacco
operation, I arrive at a value somewhere between $85 and $90'' a
share, said Pavlos Alexandrakis, an analyst with Argus Research
Corp. in New York.
   ``I'm telling our clients to hold on to the stocks. I think
something else is going to happen,'' he said.
   Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said the deal was an indication of how undervalued RJR Nabisco's
stock was, having been driven lower by worries over recent tobacco
liability lawsuits.
   But Adelman said investors currently are paying more attention
to companies' ability to generate cash rather than provide
earnings, and that makes companies with undervalued stocks
especially attractive.
   He said RJR Nabisco's stock should trade at between $90 and $100
a share, and said Johnson, the company president, ``is trying to
steal the company'' at $75 a share.
   Thursday's announcement moved Standard & Poor's Corp., the
credit rating service, to place RJR Nabisco on its ``creditwatch''
list because ``such a deal would severely weaken the firm's balance
sheet.''
   If the deal were completed, it would be the biggest leveraged
buyout of an American corporation by far. The largest LBO was the
$6.1 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos. by an investment group led by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in 1986.
   In a leveraged buyout, the buyer borrows the money to buy the
company, then pays off the debt either through company revenue or
selling off parts of the operation.
   It also would surpass the biggest corporate acquisition, the
$13.4 billion purchase of Gulf Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.
   Analysts speculated the management group was motivated by
concern that the company could become the target of another suitor.
   The food industry has been awash with takeover bids of late. On
Monday, Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered to buy processed foods
manufacturer Kraft Inc. for $11 billion and Tuesday, Pillsbury Co.
rejected a $5.23 billion bid from the British firm Grand
Metropolitan PLC.
   RJR Nabisco was formed when the tobacco company R.J. Reynolds
Industries Inc. bought Nabisco Brands Inc., the food and consumer
products giant, for $4.9 billion in 1985.
   Johnson came to the conglomerate from Nabisco and last year
shifted the company's headquarters from Winston-Salem, N.C., to
Atlanta in a move seen as an attempt to distance the company from
its tobacco beginnings.
   The company's products are some of the best-known in the
country, and also include Salem cigarettes, Lorna Doone and
Mallomar cookies, Chuckles and Junior Mints candy, Del Monte
vegetables and Milk-Bone dog biscuits.
   It is currently test-marketing a smokeless cigarette, Premier.
   In the quarter ended Sept. 30, RJR Nabisco said it earned $355
million, or $1.55 per share, on sales of $4.16 billion, compared to
$320 million, or $1.24 per share, on sales of $3.84 billion in the
same quarter last year.
   Income from tobacco operations was $497 million in the quarter
on sales of $1.78 billion, while food income accounted for $276
million on $2.38 billion in sales.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company said it
earned $982 million, or $4.14 a share, up 17 percent from $839
million, or $3.24 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales
for the first three quarters rose to $12.2 billion from $11.3
billion.
   In 1987, RJR Nabisco had profits of $1.18 billion on sales of
$15.77 billion. That level of sales would make RJR Nabisco the
third largest privately held company in the country according to
Forbes magazine, behind Cargill, a commodity trading company, and
Safeway Stores Inc., the grocery chain.
   Earlier this year, the company announced a reorganization of its
food business, separating its biscuit and grocery foods divisions
into two free-standing operating companies. RJR Nabisco said the
move would make it more responsive to changes in the marketplace.
   In the past few years, the company has sold off divisions,
including Kentucky Fried Chicken, that did not fit with its
long-range plans.

<HEAD>Copper Matches Record High, Further Gains Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper for spot delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange
matched the exchange's record high price of $1.46 a pound Thursday
and analysts predicted further gains due to tight supplies, strong
demand and a miners strike in Peru.
   On other markets, precious metals retreated; soybean prices
collapsed; grain futures moved lower; energy futures were mixed;
livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   ``Copper is just galloping along,'' said Bette Raptopoulos,
metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   The contract for October delivery of copper on the Comex hit
$1.46 a pound, the record high posted last Dec. 31, fairly late in
Thursday's session following a bout of profit-taking from
Wednesday's sharp gains. Another round of late selling brought the
October price down to a close of $1.4575, up 4.05 cents from
Wednesday.
   Copper for delivery in December rose 2.65 cents to $1.36.
   The general strike in Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper
producer, stretched into a third day Thursday but that has been
only one factor in copper's rise from around $1 a pound on Sept. 1.
   In addition to persistent labor problems in Peru and Chile,
which ranks along with the United States as a leading copper
producer, rail transportation of copper has been a major problem in
Zambia, the No. 4 copper producer. Canada ranks third in copper
production worldwide.
   Thus, supplies of copper have been extremely tight for more than
a year despite increased output by North American producers.
   The lastest figures from the American Bureau of Metal Statistics
show domestic inventories of refined copper at 52,500 short tons on
Aug. 31, more than 35 percent below the Dec. 31 level and nearly 63
percent below the year-ago figure.
   On the demand side, consumption typically rises in the fourth
quarter and this year has been no exception. In fact, experts say
demand was unusually strong last year and remains so this year
because of the strong economies of the major industrialized
countries.
   Speculators have recently joined commercial players in the
copper futures market, and the additional buying has helped to pump
up prices, analysts said.
   ``All in all, it's become a bullish scenario,'' Ms. Raptopoulos
said. ``As long as the Peru strike goes on and the tightness
remains, this market will have to trend higher.''
   Precious metals advanced slightly on the Comex in light trading
as the inflation-sensitive gold market awaited news from an OPEC
committee meeting in Madrid, Spain, to discuss efforts to stabilize
oil prices.
   Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents higher with December at
$415.40 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent higher across the board
with December at $6.41 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices collapsed to 12-week lows on the Chicago
Board of Trade on a combination of bearish fundamental and
technical factors.
   Most grain futures also closed lower.
   Soybeans opened mostly lower and selling accelerated steadily,
fueled first by news of heavy beneficial rains in a major
soybean-growing area of Brazil and later by bearish technical
signals as the price for November delivery of soybeans broke key
support levels at $8 and $7.88 a bushel, analysts said.
   The November contract closed at $7.84{ a bushel, the lowest
soybean price on the Board of Trade since July 26.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 4 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.23{ a bushel; corn was 4{ cents lower to
} cent higher with December at $2.86\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
3{ cents lower with December at $2.54} a bushel; soybeans were 10{
cents to 22 cents lower with November at $7.84{ a bushel.
   Crude and heating oil futures fell amid profit-taking on the New
York Mercantile Exchange but gasoline futures advanced on
indications of tight supplies.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 80 cents
lower with November at $14.60 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent to
.79 cent lower with November at 43.06 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .04 cent to .36 cent higher with November at 49.35
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on position-evening ahead of Friday's quarterly USDA
cattle-on-feed report. Pork futures were mixed in cautious trading
ahead of the USDA's monthly cold-storage report, which is also due
out after Friday's close.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent lower to .38 cent higher with
October, which expired Thursday, at 72.70 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .05 cent lower to .17 cent higher with October at 81.85
cents a pound; live hogs were .78 cent lower to .10 cent higher
with October, which expired Thursday, at 39.27 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .28 cent to .77 cent higher with February
at 48.92 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Merc. The
contract for December delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 settled
5.95 points higher at 284.75.

<TEXT>
   USX Corp. has not received any realistic offers
for its idled Baytown plant since the steel and oil giant agreed to
wait six months before negotiating a sale to Iraq, the company's
chairman said Wednesday.
   ``We'd love to sell the mill _ at a full price,'' said David M.
Roderick, USX chairman of the board and chief executive officer.
``But I don't know what will happen.''
   USX stirred up controversy this summer after confirming it was
negotiating a deal to dismantle the plant and sell its equipment to
Iraq, which wanted it to build pipes for irrigation and oil
production.
   Opposition to the proposed Iraq sale has been led by U.S. Rep.
Jack Fields, R-Texas, whose district includes Baytown. Fields
claims the sale would cause a loss of U.S. jobs and steelmaking
capacity.
   Roderick told members of the Houston Club Wednesday a letter of
intent had been worked out to sell the equipment, but Iraq never
followed through with the money.
   A couple of weeks ago _ at the request of U.S. Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas _ Roderick said he agreed to wait six months before
entering any agreement with Iraq and to consider offers from
domestic buyers.
   Roderick said Brooks told him that also would give Congress time
to consider whether to pass sanctions against Iraq for its alleged
poison gas attacks on Kurdish villages in the northern part of the
country during its war with Iran.
   That bill, which includes an amendment that could require USX to
obtain presidential approval before it sells any equipment to Iraq,
is pending in the Senate.
   Since that time, prospective buyers have looked at the plant but
no realistic offers have been made, Roderick said.
   ``We're not giving it away,'' he added.
   Roderick would not confirm reports the proposed sale of the
plant's equipment to Iraq was for $100 million, but he did say any
sale to a domestic buyer required more money because it also would
involve land.
   ``We've had some people who have looked at it, and I'm sure will
look at it again. We've had an offer on it before, which we have
said has been unacceptable to us, and whether somebody will make us
another offer, we can't tell,'' he said.
   A realistic offer, he said, is ``one that meets my price, all
cash.''
   Roderick denied claims that USX does not want to sell the plant
to a U.S. company because it fears further competition.

   Assets of the nation's 452 money market mutual
funds rose $1.18 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $268.76 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $428.6 million increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 223 general purpose funds rose $325.7 million to $85.36
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds increased $508.9 million
to $113.85 billion, and assets of 127 institutional funds rose
$348.1 million to $69.55 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.49 percent from 7.47 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.47 percent from 7.45 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
37 days, up from 35 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was
unchanged at 6.05 percent as of Wednesday.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, rose to 5.12 percent from 5.11 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.80
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.77 the
previous week. Yields were 8.11 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.08
percent; 8.32 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.31 percent; and
8.57 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.58 percent.

<HEAD>AT&T Reports 16 Percent Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. reported
Thursday its third-quarter earnings rose 16.2 percent on the
strength of cost cutting and strong sales growth.
   Bell Atlantic Corp., one of the regional operating companies
spun off in the breakup of the Bell System nearly five years ago,
said its profit rose 6 percent.
   AT&T said its net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $587
million, or 55 cents per share, up from $505 million, or 47 cents
per share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 3.2 percent
to $8.75 billion from $8.47 billion.
   AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen attributed the results to
``double-digit growth in product sales and an increase in
long-distance revenues.''
   Product sales for the quarter rose 12.4 percent and sales of
services increased by 2.2 percent. Rental revenues, which account
for less than 10 percent of total revenues, declined.
   Staff redeployment to sales positions and a hiring halt also
helped bolster the latest results, AT&T said. The hiring halt,
announced in July, reduced the work force by 4,000 to 311,000 as of
Sept. 30.
   For the first nine months of the year, earnings were up 8.2
percent to $1.67 billion, or $1.56 per share, compared with $1.55
billion, or $1.42 per share, in 1987. Revenue increased 3.4 percent
to $25.85 billion from $24.99 billion.
   AT&T noted its plan, announced earlier, to lower interstate
long-distance prices by $697 million on Dec. 1. It also said it was
stepping up its shift to a digital telephone network, which could
result in faster depreciation of old analog equipment and related
facilities.
   That process could affect future earnings since the equipment
and plant have book value of $4 billion to $5 billion, but AT&T
said it could not estimate the impact until further study was
completed later this year.
   Bell Atlantic said its net profit totaled $341 million, or $1.72
a share, in the quarter, compared with earnings of $321.8 million,
or $1.62 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased to $2.61
billion from $2.59 billion.
   For the nine months, earnings increased 6 percent to $1.01
billion, or $5.12 a share, compared with $955.4 million, or $4.80 a
share, in 1987. Revenue was unchanged at $7.7 billion.
   Bell Atlantic, which is based in Philadelphia, attributed its
results to increased sales, efficiency and growth in the regional
economy. The company serves six Eastern states and the District of
Columbia.
   The company said its increased business was attributed to lower
rates for local and toll services and reduced charges for access to
long-distance companies.

   Monsanto Co. on Thursday reported a 16 percent
rise in its third-quarter net income as the company's agricultural
and chemical units enjoyed healthy demand for their products.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, earnings totaled $116 million,
or $1.67 a share, up from $100 million, or $1.30 a share a year
earlier. Revenue during the period totaled $2 billion, up from $1.9
billion a year ago.
   Agricultural and chemical results led third-quarter earnings,
the company said. Monsanto said it expects its G.D. Searle
subsidiary, acquired in 1985, to build on improved third-quarter
results and show a profit by 1989.
   For the first nine months of 1988, net income totaled $546
million, or $7.57 a share, up 39 percent from $392 million, or
$5.01 a share in the year-ago period. Revenue totaled $6.4 billion,
up from $5.8 billion for the same period in 1987.

   American Brands Inc.'s third-quarter profit rose
14.5 percent from a year earlier to a record level, the cigarette,
liquor and financial services company said Wednesday.
   American Brands, with headquarters in Old Greenwich, Conn., said
its earnings rose to $147 million, or $1.53 a share, from $128.4

   American Brands said it was enjoying continued growth in its
cigarette business in the United States and Britain, which includes
Carlton, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Tareyton, as well as in its
distilled spirits business, which includes Jim Beam bourbon and

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
rose in early October, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The central bank said its narrowest measure of the money supply,
M1, rose $2.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted average of $784.5
billion in the week ended Oct. 10 from $782.3 billion the previous
week.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,035.5 billion from $3,031.0 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,864.4 billion from $3,856.1 billion the previous week.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates as well the
two broadest money supply measures.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported discount window
borrowings, excluding extended credit, averaged $600 million a day
in the week ended Wednesday, up from $446 million a day in the
previous week.
   It said the two-week average was $523 million a day, down from
$734 million a day in the previous two-week period and the lowest
for any period since the two weeks ended June 29 when borrowing
averaged $520 million a day.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $282.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $282.1 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Kraft To Philip Morris: We Won't Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kraft Inc., target of an $11 billion
takeover bid, fired off a terse letter to the chairman of Philip
Morris Cos. Thursday rejecting a request for negotiations.
   The letter disclosed that Kraft Chairman John M. Richman crossed
paths with Philip Morris Chairman Hamish Maxwell a few days before
the business world was stunned by Monday's cash bid.
   ``You did not see fit to discuss your takeover attempt when we
were together at the Grocery Manufacturers of America meeting last
Wednesday and Thursday,'' Richman wrote.
   ``Nor did you see fit to tell me that you were planning on
filing a bizarre and baseless lawsuit against me and our board of
directors Monday,'' he said.
   ``You must have been planning your takeover bid for a long time.
We intend to take our time and study the situation very carefully.
We have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders and an obligation to
our employees, customers, suppliers and communities to do so.''
   New York-based Philip Morris' $90-a-share offer would give it
control of a company that has a 25 percent stake of the U.S. market
for natural cheese and 60 percent of the processed cheese market.
   Maxwell said Thursday that Philip Morris had 64 banks lined up
to finance the deal.
   ``Our cash offer is a generous one,'' he said.
   Buying Kraft would make Philip Morris the king of supermarket
aisles, with products ranging from Miller Lite beer and Jell-O to
such non-Kraft brands as Miracle Whip, Sealtest and Breyer's ice
cream, Celestial Seasonings tea and Lender's bagels.
   Philip Morris, whose main businesses are brewing, tobacco and
food, has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago
challenging Kraft's first line of defense, a ``poison pill'' that
kicks in when an unwanted suitor acquires 20 percent of Kraft stock.
   In that event, Kraft would double the number of shares, making a
buyout expensive.
   Analysts, however, believe poison pill challenges are standard
procedure and they doubt a battle for Kraft would turn on a court
case.
   In an unrelated matter, Kraft said it signed a letter to acquire
Mueller Food Service Corp., based in Menomonee Falls, Wis. Terms of
the deal were not disclosed, but Mueller had sales of $60 million
in its 1987 fiscal year.

<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. William Proxmire, frustrated by his
unsuccessful fight to pass legislation restructuring the nation's
banking system, on Thursday called for regulators to act without
waiting for Congress.
   ``Congress has failed to do the job,'' the Wisconsin Democrat
said. ``There is not a scrap of real evidence that Congress will
act in the future. The time has come for the Federal Reserve Board
to act.''
   The statement by Proxmire, who is chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, brought him in direct conflict with House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, and House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand J. St
Germain, D-R.I. Wright last week warned Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan that changes in the banking system are
``rightfully a legislative concern.'' And, St Germain threatened to
use the next bank bill to reverse any regulatory changes between
now and then.
   In March, the Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation
permitting banks to underwrite securities, forbidden turf since
1933 when Congress enacted the Glass-Steagall Act, separating
banking from the securities business, as part of the wave of
Depression-era reforms.
   Proxmire has argued that technological developments since then
have allowed securities firms to poach on banks' traditional
business and have put banks at a competitive disadvantage.
   As a tribute to the banking chairman, the Senate named its bill
after Proxmire, who is retiring after 31 years in Congress.
   However, the legislation ran aground in the House last week
after St Germain and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, failed to settle a
jurisdictional feud over which committee would have the greater say
over the bill.
   Proxmire had hoped to circumvent the House tangle by having the
Senate pass the bill again, in pieces, and send it back to the
House. But when his package came to the Senate floor on Wednesday,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, D-N.Y., a supporter of the securities
industry and one of only two senators opposing the original bill,
blocked it.
   St Germain promised action on the bank bill ``before the snow
melts'' next year, but Proxmire said, ``That is not going to happen
this year, and it almost certainly won't happen next year, or for
many years to come.''
   Citing a Supreme Court decision in June that upheld the Fed's
power to permit bank underwriting of securities, Proxmire said,
``The Fed should move and move promptly in the future.''

<HEAD>Lamar Hunt Settles Silver Case for $17 Million</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with further details, background.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas businessman Lamar Hunt paid $17 million to
Peru's state-owned mineral company Thursday to settle his part of a
jury finding that he and two of his brothers plotted to corner the
world silver market.
   The settlement was approved by U.S. District Judge Morris E.
Lasker, who presided over the nearly seven-month civil trial in
Manhattan of Hunt and his brothers, Nelson Bunker Hunt and William
Herbert Hunt.
   The trial ended with the jury finding that the brothers, sons of
the late oil billionaire H.L. Hunt, owed $132 million in damages to
Minpeco SA, the Peruvian minerals concern.
   The settlement involved only Lamar Hunt, 56, who is owner of the
Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League.
   His attorney, Paul Curran, told Lasker that Lamar Hunt was
settling the matter because he ``wanted to put an end to the very
heavy legal and emotional costs of this litigation.''
   Hunt's office in Kansas City, Mo., issued a statement saying the
$17 million was ``a small fraction of the liabilities possible
under the judgment, interest and on-going costs inherent in
continuing the legal action.''
   Curran also maintained that the settlement did not alter Lamar
Hunt's contention that he had done nothing wrong.
   Hunt's statement said, ``In spite of the fact that the claims
against me were totally unwarranted, because of the uncertainties
of litigation and the substantial cost associated with further
proceedings, I made the business decision to put the litigation
behind me so that I can spend my time pursuing positive business
interests.''
   A lawyer representing some 17,000 investors who are suing the
Hunts and others in two large class-action suits complained to
Lasker about certain aspects of the settlement.
   The lawyer, Herbert Deutsch, noted that under the settlement,
the Minpeco verdict against Lamar Hunt could not be used in the
class action lawsuits and the allegations would have to be proven
all over again, ``in effect, making 6{ months of trial a nullity.''
   But Lasker said he was pleased to approve the settlement.
   ``I always believe settlement is better than disposition by
other means,'' he said.
   Under the settlement's terms, Lamar Hunt paid $17 million to
Minpeco and the outcome of the jury's finding against him was
dismissed by Lasker.
   After the $17 million check had been turned over, Mark Cymrot,
Minpeco's attorney, said: ``We view this as the first installment
payment by the Hunts.''
   He said Minpeco was ``pursuing Bunker and Herbert Hunt in
bankruptcy court.''
   Those two brothers filed for personal bankruptcy in Dallas late
last month. The Chapter 11 filings, which will protect the Hunts'
assets from creditors while they reorganize their finances, so far
have protected them from paying the $132.45 million jury award.
   Last August, a federal court civil jury found the three Hunts
were part of an unsuccessful scheme nine years ago to corner the
world silver market.
   The jury found in favor of Minpeco, which sued the Hunts
claiming it lost more than $100 million after the silver market
collapsed in March 1980.
   Minpeco's lawyers said they would file papers at bankruptcy
court in Dallas on Friday seeking to unfreeze the Hunts' assets so
Minpeco could pursue collection efforts against them.
   ``We believe that our client's claims cannot be discharged by
the bankruptcy action,'' said one of Minpeco's lawyers, Thomas O.
Gorman.

<HEAD>A&P Increases Offer For Delchamps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. Inc.
sweetened its offer Thursday for Delchamps Inc. a Mobile-based
grocery chain, to $32 a share from $30 just days after both
companies took the takeover battle to federal court.
   ``The only comment we have is that our directors will meet in
the near future to review and evaluate their offer and we will
release our findings at that time,'' said Delchamps spokesman Joel
Swanson.
   Swanson said he did not know if the tender offer, worth $224
million, had an expiration date.
   The previous $30 a share offer, worth $210 million, was to
expire Nov. 4. A&P tried to buy Delchamps for $27 a share last
October, and for $24 a share in 1986.
   Each grocery store chain is suing the other in U.S. District
Court in Mobile as A&P seeks to re-establish itself on the Gulf
Coast and Delchamps tries to retain its regional domain.
   Delchamps filed a lawsuit Monday accusing A&P of failing to
disclose potential violations of antitrust laws in its takeover
proposal and devising a plan to financially cripple Delchamps even
if it fails to buy the company.
   A&P filed a counter lawsuit Wednesday against Delchamps seeking
a court order that would prevent the Mobile-based grocery chain
from blocking any threat to its control.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Mobile, accuses
Delchamps of taking repeated steps to ``thwart serious
consideration'' of its proposed acquisition by A&P, a Maryland
corporation headquartered in New Jersey.
   A&P already owns 4.5 percent of Delchamps' 7 million shares of
stock, Swanson said.
   A&P accuses Delchamps in its lawsuit of misleading its
shareholders and the investment community.
   Unless Delchamps is prevented from taking further actions to
block any threat to its control, the suit claims, the Mobile
company may take other actions to block shareholders from fairly
considering A&P's offer.
   In a letter mailed to shareholders Monday, Delchamps Chairman
and President A.F. Delchamps Jr. said the Delchamps board
determined that A&P's offer is inadequate and it was in the
stockholders' best interest for the company to remain independent.
   Delchamps accused A&P of starting a fight to ``pick off the
company at a cheap price and proceed with its plan to achieve
dominance in the Gulf Coast retail stores market'' or at least to
``cause internal dissension and uncertainty,'' thereby weakening
Delchamps as a competitor.
   Delchamps stock has been trading at slightly more than $27 a
share since A&P began making the latest takeover attempt.
Delchamps, which operates 102 stores, had sales of about $700
million last year.
   A&P, which has 1,170 stores in the United States and Canada, had
sales of $9.6 billion in 1987.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that
Attorney General John Van de Kamp could not use California
antitrust law to challenge the federally approved $10.1 billion
buyout of Getty Oil Co. by Texaco, the second largest merger in
U.S. history.
   The court ruled 4-3 that California's 1907 antitrust law does
not apply to mergers.
   Van de Kamp, who had contended the 1984 merger would eventually
lead to higher gasoline prices in the state by drying up oil
supplies to cut-rate independent refiners, said the setback would
not end his efforts to strengthen state antitrust enforcement.
   ``I believe that ... the Reagan administration's abdication of
antitrust enforcement made it important to use California law to
rein in mergers that threaten our state's economy,'' Van de Kamp
told reporters after the ruling.
   He said he would ask the Legislature to broaden state law to
expressly cover mergers, and would challenge other mergers under
federal antitrust law, such as his suit against the merger of the
Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains. A federal judge in Los
Angeles has ordered the two markets to continue operating
separately, a ruling that is being appealed.
   Federal law allows challenges to mergers but has some drawbacks,
including a lack of authority, under current interpretations, to
require a merged company to sell off some of its holdings, Van de
Kamp said. At issue in the Lucky-Alpha Beta appeal is whether
federal law allows the attorney general to challenge a merger on
behalf of the people of the state.
   Texaco lawyer Laurence Popofsky praised Thursday's decision and
said suits like Van de Kamp's raise the question of ``whether it is
appropriate to have 50 state attorney generals second-guessing
federal authorities'' on mergers in interstate commerce.
   The Texaco-Getty case was the first attempt by a California
attorney general to use state antitrust law against a merger, and
is an example of efforts by Van de Kamp and his counterparts in
other states to fill the gap left by the Reagan administration's
relaxation of federal antitrust enforcement.
   Van de Kamp is also leading an eight-state lawsuit in federal
court claiming a conspiracy by insurance companies to cut back on
coverage to public agencies and drive up rates.
   In a dissent to Thursday's ruling, Justice Stanley Mosk _ who as
state attorney general from 1959 to 1964 was the first to enforce
California's antitrust laws extensively _ said that in light of
federal policy, ``vigorous enforcement of state antitrust laws is
plainly necessary.''
   The Reagan administration ``has all but ceased enforcing the
federal antitrust laws as they apply to mergers,'' Mosk said,
citing a study that said the Justice Department had contested only
26 out of over 10,000 merger applications between 1981 and 1986.
   The majority opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas did not
discuss whether a state could or should have its own policy on
mergers, ruling only that California's 81-year-old Cartwright Act
did not apply.
   The Texaco-Getty merger was second in size only to Chevron's
$13.2 billion acquisition of Gulf. More than half of Getty's
property consisted of California crude oil. It also owned a
632-mile San Joaquin Valley pipeline, the only one in the state
available to independent refiners.
   The Federal Trade Commission allowed the Texaco buyout in June
1984, requiring only that Texaco continue sales of former Getty oil
to independent refiners in California through April 1989. After
that, the FTC assumed, new supplies of offshore oil would be
available to the independents.
   After state courts refused to block the merger, Van de Kamp
maintained his suit, asking at least for additional protections for
the independents, such as extensions of their oil purchase
contracts beyond 1989 and guaranteed access to the pipeline. He
said the offshore supplies were uncertain and would be controlled
by major refiners who would not sell to independents.
   Sacramento Superior Court Judge Benjamin Diaz and a state
appeals court dismissed the suit, saying FTC approval of the
merger, after consideration of the issues raised by Van de Kamp,
precluded a state lawsuit. The Supreme Court majority reached the
same result by different reasoning.
   Lucas said mergers are not covered by the language of the
Cartwright Act, which prohibits any ``combination of capital'' that
might affect prices.
   The chief justice said the California law was modeled after
antitrust statutes in Michigan and Texas that had been interpreted
by courts in 1899 and 1904 to apply only to business dealings
between two companies that maintained separate identities, and not
to a purchase of one company by another.
   Mosk, in a dissent joined by Justices Marcu Kaufman and Allen
Broussard, said the language of the California law on
``combinations of capital'' clearly was broad enough to cover
mergers.

   Eastern Airlines flight attendants won't join
other unions at Eastern in trying to block the $365 million sale of
the Northeast shuttle to developer Donald Trump, an attorney said
in court Thursday.
   Union attorney Arthur Luby said the Transport Workers union was
attempting to negotiate a contract with Trump for the 300 flight
attendants who work on the three-city shuttle, the only profitable
operation at Miami-based Eastern.
   Because of ``the very, very difficult working conditions,'' the
union ``couldn't in good conscience go and do something that forces
them to continue to work for Eastern when they might have a chance
to do something to improve their lot,'' Luby told U.S. District
Judge Barrington D. Parker at a hearing on the proposed deal.
   Two other unions at Eastern, the International Association of
Machinists and the Air Line Pilots Association, have announced
plans to seek a preliminary injunction to block the cash sale.
   The Machinists and pilots contend that the deal is part of an
attempt by Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., to undermine the
strength of organized labor. Texas Air says it needs to sell the
shuttle to get needed cash in order to save Eastern from financial
failure.
   The unions have sought to use the mandatory bargaining
provisions of the Railway Labor Act to stop Eastern from laying off
employees and cutting operations of the ailing carrier.
   Parker, whose order barring Eastern from laying off more than
3,000 employees was overturned last month by a federal appeals
court, gave the two unions until Nov. 21 to request a preliminary
injunction.
   Although he suggested that the unions might be ``baying at the
moon'' in light of the appeals court ruling on the layoffs, Parker
said he considered the shuttle deal a separate issue and that he is
prepared to hear arguments on it.
   The shuttle sale is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 15. Parker
indicated he would hold a hearing in the first two weeks of
December, a schedule that sets the stage for another eleventh-hour
court battle between Eastern and the unions.

   The stock market climbed to new heights since
last year's crash with a rally Thursday that gathered momentum as
the session progressed.
   Analysts said a rash of takeover bids and buyout announcements
involving big-name companies in recent days played a large part in
reviving enthusiasm for stocks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 22.58
points on Wednesday, jumped 43.92 to 2,181.19. That surpassed the
previous 1988 closing high of 2,159.85 reached on Tuesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,058 up, 416 down and 504 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 189.58 million
shares, against 186.35 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 221.43 million shares.
   The market was unsettled Wednesday by rising interest rates and
a rumor that a major newspaper was about to publish a story
potentially harmful to the presidential campaign of Vice President
Bush. The rumor was quickly denied, however.
   Analysts said buying was encouraged Thursday by abundant
takeover news and rumors, which create opportunities for quick
trading profits.
   In the newest development on that front, RJR Nabisco soared 21]
to 77\ on word that a management group may propose to buy out the
company for about $75 a share.
   That prompted buying of such other tobacco stocks as American
Brands, up 4} at 59, and Philip Morris, up 5 at 99. Philip Morris
is itself in the process of going after Kraft, which traded
Thursday at 90\, down [.
   At the same time, market participants were looking ahead to
Friday's scheduled report from the government on the consumer price
index for September.
   Any sign of new upward pressure on inflation would increase
expectations of further credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve,
but concern on that score seemed to ebb Thursday.
   American Telephone & Telegraph rose | to 27{ in active trading.
The company reported third-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share, up
from 47 cents in the comparable period last year.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up ~ at 45{;
International Business Machines, up 2{ at 124~; General Electric,
up ~ at 45, and Union Carbide, up 1} at 27\.
   Pittston picked up 1\ to 15} on higher quarterly profits.
   Quantum, which said it planned to buy back 2 million of its
shares through a tender offer, gained 1] to 13| in the
over-the-counter market.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $45.27 billion, or
1.65 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
2.83 to 159.01.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 7.26 to 326.07, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 5.91 to 282.88.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 2.86 to 388.62. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 306.37, up 1.89.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amoco Corp. said Thursday its third-quarter
profit jumped 34 percent due mainly to strong performance in
refining, marketing and transportation operations.
   For the third quarter, Amoco had after-tax profits of $552
million, or $2.15 per share, up from $412 million, or $1.60 a
share, in the year-ago period. Revenue totaled $5.9 billion in
1988, compared with $5.8 billion reported in 1987, the company said.
   ``Increased customer demand has had a twofold effect on
refining, marketing and transportation operations,'' said Richard
M. Morrow, chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``First, it has resulted in higher sales volumes, which has
enabled us to run our refineries at higher utilization rates,'' he
said in a statement. ``The increased demand has also caused
industry refining tightness which resulted in strong product
margins.
   ``Many of these same factors also favorably impacted chemical
operations, allowing us to maintain near-record earnings from these
activities.''
   Earnings for the first nine months of 1988 totaled $1.69
million, or $6.56 a share, up 72 percent from $983 million, or
$3.84 a share, in the first nine months of 1987, Amoco said.
   Year-to-date revenue increased 7 percent, to $17.9 billion,
compared with $16.7 billion for the first nine months of 1987, the
company said.

   Directors of furniture and apparel maker
Interco Inc. on Thursday rejected a sweetened, $2.7 billion tender
offer from an investment group and boosted the value of the
company's own restructuring plan.
   Cardinal Acquisition Corp., headed by brothers Steven M. and
Mitchell P. Rales of Washington, D.C., had increased its hostile
offer from $70 a share to $74 on Monday. The tender offer was
extended until 11 p.m. Oct. 31.
   ``There's probably more to come,'' Laurence C. Day, a Newhard
Cook analyst, said of the bid by the Raleses. ``They've indicated
that. They've always indicated that all along.''
   Interco's financial advisers, Wasserstein, Perella & Co.,
recommended rejection of Cardinal's latest offer, labeling it
inadequate.
   Separately, Cardinal said in a release that a federal appeals
court lifted an injunction against the tender offer. The ruling, by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia,
allows Cardinal to purchase Interco shares.
   Interco, for which Cardinal originally bid $64 in July, rose 62{
cents to $71.12{ a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Thursday.
   ``The stock wouldn't be where it is if it weren't for the
takeover offer,'' First Boston industry analyst Margaret Gilliam
said in New York City. ``If the offer is increased, I think it will
be by only small increments from here on out.''
   Interco also announced that as a part of a restructuring and
recapitalization plan outlined last month it has declared an
additional special dividend totaling $30.80 per share in cash and
securities.
   ``With today's declaration, we have now declared $55.80 in
special dividends as part of our restructuring program,'' said
Harvey Saligman, board chairman and chief executive officer.
   Saligman said Interco also is considering an increase in the
amount of preferred securities to be issued in the restructuring.
   ``From Interco's point, they're buying time _ perhaps to sell
some assets. They're also creating confusion,'' analyst Day said of
the special dividend. ``There's a limit somewhere. It's hard at
this point to really see what the total value of the (Interco)
package would be.''
   Cardinal has been blocked at least temporarily by a federal
appeals court from completing its tender offer pending further
review in Delaware of an Interco court challenge.
   Interco has alleged that Cardinal failed to divulge that Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment firm, is a co-bidder in the
takeover attempt. Interco also contends the tender offer is
leveraged so high it violates federal securities laws.
   Saligman said Interco's board considers its restructuring,
combining continued shareholder participation in the company with
the enhancement of the special dividends, superior to Cardinal's
tender offer.
   The Raleses own 8.7 percent of Interco's stock. The latest
Cardinal offer is subject to 75 percent participation among
Interco's 36.2 million shares outstanding and the withdrawal of a
``poison pill'' shareholders rights plan.
   Interco manufactures men's and women's apparel, footwear,
furniture ahd home furnishings. Company sales for the first half of
the current fiscal year were $1.27 billion, up 3 percent from 1987.

<TEXT>
   Iran's Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh
said Thursday Iran would not accept production parity with Iraq, a
goal sought by the majority of OPEC oil ministers who met in the
Spanish capital to discuss how to stem excess output by cartel
members.
   Following the 90-minute session at the Algerian Embassy of the
price and long-term strategy committees of the Organization of
Petroleum-Exporting Countries, spokesman James Audu said the
organization's secretary general Subroto would hold a news
conference Friday morning prior to beginning a second meeting.
   After the meeting broke up, Iraq's Oil Minister Issam
Abdul-Raheem Al-Chalabi said it was too early for him to comment on
his country's position on a production sharing agreement.
   Indonesia's Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita told reporters
there were ``some miles to go'' before a production agreement could
be reached but added that all 13 OPEC members were committeed to
finding a solution to ``current discord.''
   Current OPEC production is estimated at around 20 million to 21
million barrels a day, far above the cartel's official ceiling of
15.06 million barrels a day.
   Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have proposed
17.4 million barrels a day, including Iraq's share, as a more
realistic ceiling.
   Iraq, now outside the quota system, has demanded a quota equal
to that of Iran, at 2.369 million barrels a day.
   Analysts report that Iraq has been pumping at least 2.6 million
barrels of crude a day, an amount that could rise to 3.7 million
barrels in mid-1989 with the completion of a a new pipeline through
Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea.
   Iran has been pumping 2.5 million barrels a day, the analysts
say.
   Oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Nigeria all said
Thursday they would only accept a new production pact if it
included Iraq.
   But Aqazadeh, who is meeting with his Iraqi counterpart
Al-Chalabi for the first time in an OPEC setting since an August
cease-fire ended the eight-year Gulf War, said Iran would not
accept an agreement that gave Iraq production parity. He added he
had no alternative proposals to solve the long-standing problem.
   Both Iran and Iraq want to pump and sell as much oil as possible
to increase revenue to rebuild their war-battered nations.
   Venezuelan Oil Minister Julio Cesar Gil said Thursday if OPEC
nations don't comply with their production quotas under any new
agreement, the cartel would simply find itself facing the same oil
glut that has been forcing prices down in the past months.
   An excess of oil on international markets has sent prices
tumbling to below $12 a barrel in recent weeks, far below the OPEC
target of $18 a barrel.
   The OPEC price committee includes oil ministers from Algeria,
Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela.
   Ministers from Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
sit on the long-term strategy committee.
   The remaining OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.
   The price committee met Sept. 25-26 in Madrid without resolving
the production problem. All 13 OPEC members are to meet in Vienna
in November.

<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union and
Caterpillar Inc. have reached a contract accord on all issues
except those to be addressed by the union at the local level, chief
UAW negotiator Bill Casstevens said late Thursday.
   Casstevens said the union will strike, however, unless
Caterpillar meets with UAW locals and settles their issues by 11
p.m. Friday.
   ``The issues that remain that separate us are issues that we say
are local in nature,'' said Casstevens, secretary-treasurer of the
UAW International. ``The company disagrees with us.''
   Casstevens said the locals would be authorized to ``take
whatever action they deemed necessary,'' including a strike, if the
deadline was not met.
   A spokesman for Caterpillar was not immediately available for
comment.
   Casstevens confirmed that one of the main issues still
separating the two sides was contract provisions concerning special
job classifications, which restrict workers from transferring
between jobs within the company.
   ``We are saying we have an understanding on the central items
that we could recommend to the membership. The items that separate
us are items that we say are local in nature and have to be
resolved on the local table,'' Casstevens said.
   He said he hoped the company would resume talks on the local
level.
   ``We're sending them back to the local table,'' Casstevens said.
``We hope they'll talk. You can't resolve it without doing that.''
   The local unions that reportedly have not reached local
agreements with the company include East Peoria, Aurora and
Decatur, Ill.
   Jerry Brown, bargaining chairman of Local 974 of Peoria, said
the local was prepared to strike. He said it had given the company
a proposal Tuesday and was waiting for a response.
   Brown said the union would not to grant an extension on its
local talks. He said the union had considered the economic
consequences of staging a walkout, but added that the union might
not have a choice.
   ``We don't take a strike lightly and we didn't come down here to
bargain for a strike, but we're not going to roll over and play
dead either,'' he said.
   Local members consider the job classification issue to be
important because it went against the basic idea of a senority
system and would allow some workers to be laid off before workers
with less senority, Brown said.
   He didnt rule out the possibility of a settlement before the
deadline and again urged the membership to continue reporting for
work until instructed otherwise.

<HEAD>House Approves Major Fraud Penalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved and sent to the president's
desk Thursday legislation calling for 10-year prison sentences and
$10 million fines for major government procurement fraud.
   ``Procurement fraud costs our country hundreds of millions of
dollars a year,'' Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., said as the bill
passed on a voice vote.
   The measure, which establishes a new crime of major fraud,
applies throughout the government but is designed to respond to
recent disclosures of widespread cheating among defense contractors
in military procurement.
   ``It's an insult to the taxpayers and to the many honest people
who do business with the government that the crooked contractors
often avoid prosecution and their punishment is rarely commensurate
with the crime,'' Hughes said.
   The House already had passed the measure and merely agreed to
amendments added by the Senate before sending it on to the
president for his signature. Approval came with no controversy.
   Under the bill, the maximum sentence for major fraud would be
set at 10 years in prison.
   Fines under the measure would be similar to current ones for
fraud against the government. They vary depending on the amount of
the loss. In especially flagrant cases, however, courts would have
the option of imposing penalties of up to $10 million under the
bill.
   A statute of limitations of seven years would be established
under the measure in contrast to the normal one of five years.
So-called whistle-blower protections would be provided to those who
draw attention to procurement fraud.
   Among other things, the Senate amendments would authorize $8
million over four years for the hiring of additional prosecutors to
work on procurement fraud. They also deleted a House feature that
would have provided $250,000 rewards for information leading to
conviction.

   B.F. Goodrich Co. said Thursday it will
spend $22.9 million to expand and renovate its Brecksville research
and development center.
   The project will allow Goodrich to consolidate its headquarters
and research and development staffs for its specialty polymers and
chemicals division at the Brecksville location. Those employees are
currently located at separate sites in northeast Ohio, the company
said in a news release.
   The company's patent law office will also move from corporate
headquarters in Bath to the Brecksville facility.
   ``Our specialty polymers and chemicals business requires that
marketing and sales professionals work closely with the technical
staff to develop custom formulations for specific applications,''
said Leigh Carter, Goodrich president and chief operating officer.
``By consolidating the division's functions at one location, we
hope to foster a closer, more effective working relationship that
will improve customer service and facilitate the movement of
technology into the marketplace.''
   The project will include a new, two-story, 75,100-square-foot
building, an expansion of the main existing building and other
renovations. The improvements will be carried out over the next 18
months.

working properly, on Thursday ordered the warning devices tested on
nearly 1,800 Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 jetliners.
   The action, prompted in part by two fatal airline crashes,
requires the tests to be conducted within 200 flight hours and
repeated every 200 hours to make certain that pilots are warned if
their planes are not properly configured to take off.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said the inspections, which are likely
to take about three hours, are not expected to disrupt the
airlines' normal operating schedules since they likely will be
conducted during routine maintenance.
   The takeoff alarms on the two model Boeing planes _ two of the
most widely used jet aircraft in commercial operation _ sound a
horn if the crew has forgotten to set, or set improperly, a variety
of control and operational devices in the cockpit.
   The FAA said a one-time check last month of alarms on nearly
1,186 Boeing 727s revealed that the alarms either were improperly
working or failed altogether on 35 aircraft. Twer and Southwest Airlines
are among the major users of
Boeing 737s.

   Shamrock Holdings Inc. contacted a major
investment bank to discuss a possible takeover of Polaroid Corp.
before a planned meeting between the two companies, a Shamrock
adviser testified Thursday.
   The acquisitions manager for Wertheim Schroder & Co. said he was
aware that Shamrock President Stanley P. Gold had approached Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. before a scheduled mid-July meeting that was
abruptly canceled by Polaroid.
   Ilan Kaufthal, a Wertheim Schroder managing director,
contradicted testimony Monday by Gold, who said he had contacted
several smaller banks but not Drexel, a major player in financing
corporate takeovers.
   ``I knew that Gold and Drexel were discussing financing if Gold
proceeded on the buyout'' of Polaroid, Kaufthal said, adding the
talks were held sometime between January and June.
   Burbank, Calif.-based Shamrock, controlled by the Roy E. Disney
family, is suing Polaroid in Delaware Chancery Court in an effort
to invalidate Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan that would
all but block a takeover.
   On the first day of the trial Wednesday, Gold said he had not
talked with Drexel before July 12, when Polaroid unveiled the
10-million-share, $300-million stock plan and one day before the
meeting between the two companies.
   One week later, Shamrock made its first $40-a-share bid for
Polaroid. Shamrock contends Polaroid created the stock plan to
thwart an acquisition.
   Gold did say he had talked with Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of
Nova Scotia on whether they would be interested in financing the
venture if Shamrock proceeded with the takeover.
   Shamrock rested its case Wednesday in Chancery Court before Vice
Chancellor Carolyn Berger. Polaroid was expected to begin calling
witnesses Friday. I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's chief executive
officer, is among those expected to testify.
   The stock ownership plan puts 14 percent of Polaroid stock in
the hands of employees. Under Delaware's takeover law, a hostile
bidder must acquire more than 85 percent of a target's outstanding
shares for control.
   Cambridge, Mass.-based Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware.
   Shamrock was rejected in its unsolicited bid before making a
hostile offer of $42 a share last month that values Polaroid at
about $2.6 billion. Polaroid has said the offr was too low and
advised stockholders to reject it.
   Kaufthal said Shamrock had agreed to conditions set by Polaroid
for the July 13 meeting, including that they not reach the 5
percent stock ownership threshold required for federal disclosure
or take any action requiring disclosure.
   After the meeting was canceled, Kaufthal testified that he
called a Polaroid executive and said he was ``very disappointed on
a personal and an ethical basis'' and told him ``he had lied to me
and my client.''
   On Monday, Gold testified that Wertheim Schroder proposed trying
to selling all of Polaroid's manufacturing facilities to Eastman
Kodak Co. and negotiate a settlement of Polaroid's $5.7 billion
patent infringement judgment against Kodak.
   The investment banker also proposed to slash Polaroid's research
and development expenditures by more than 50 percent and reduce its
marketing and administration staff from 3,000 to under 2,000.
   Wertheim suggested that Shamrock could realize as much as a 49
percent return on a $350 million equity investment if the entire
company was sold in 1992, according to the testimony.

<HEAD>New Computer `Virus' Found In Aldus Programs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer ``virus'' has been found in programs
at software manufacturer Aldus Corp. for the second time in eight
months, but officials said Thursday the infection has not spread to
programs for sale to the public.
   The company said despite precautions taken after a virus was
discovered in its FreeHand drawing program last March, a new virus
has turned up in an updated version of FreeHand.
   An entire computer network within Aldus' headquarters has been
infected, the company said.
   ``We don't know where it came from,'' said Jane Dauber, an Aldus
spokeswoman. ``That is the nature of the virus. You can't really
track it.''
   Viruses are small computer programs, created by programmers as
jokes or acts of vandalism, which secretly attach themselves to
other programs. The virus can then spread from computer to computer
when operators share ``infected'' programs.
   At their most benign, viruses merely flash a message on a
computer screen. At their worst, they can destroy information
stored in computer memories.
   Last month, a former Fort Worth, Texas, programmer was convicted
of planting a virus in his employer's computer system. Two days
after the employee was fired, the virus activated, erasing 168,000
company records.
   Aldus officials said their new virus, dubbed ``nVir,'' has
remained dormant so far, just a tiny program that attaches itself
to other programs.
   ``We don't know why, we don't know what invokes this virus,''
said Dauber. ``With some of them, you have to launch the program a
certain number of times,'' for the virus to activate.
   Aldus said does not know where the virus originated, although
the company said the virus apparently has infected at least one
East Coast university's computers. The name of the university was
not immediately available.
   ``You just can't always stop these things from coming in the
door,'' said Laury Bryant, a company spokeswoman. ``But what we
have done is to set up systems which elminate them before they are
actually in full version, shrink-wrap software and stop them from
going out the door.''
   Aldus says it uses rigorous testing procedures to check for
viruses in products before they are shipped to retailers. Still,
the virus was found in a version of FreeHand software sent to
specific users to be tested before the program is offered for sale.
   One of those users discovered the nVir virus and notified Aldus.
   Two days later, the software company realized the virus was in
its own in-house network of computer syustems. It is not known how
far the virus has spread.
   Aldus is a leading manufacturer of programs for ``desktop
publishing,'' in which publications are written, assembled and
edited on computers. FreeHand, written for Apple Macintosh
computers, allows computer operators to draw graphics.
   In March, in what was apparently the first instance of a virus
attaching itself to a commercial software program, a virus called
the ``March 2 peace message'' was found in some FreeHand programs.
At that time, Ms. Bryant said the message did not harm any
computers and only flashed a brief message on computer screens. The
virus died out of computers on March 2.
   The infection forced Aldus to recall or rework thousands of
packages of the new software.
