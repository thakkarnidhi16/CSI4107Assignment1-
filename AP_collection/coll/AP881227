   Seven hardened criminals were executed in
Shanghai immediately after their sentences were announced by
officials at a public rally in a local sports stadium, a pro-Beijing
newsaper reported Wednesday.
   The Chinese-language Ta Kung Pao gave details on only two of the
criminals, food market worker Cheng Zhikang and construction laborer
Lin Tiefo.
   It said that on seven occasions in the first half of the year,
Cheng robbed single women who were walking in early-morning hours
before streets became crowded. The newspaper reported he would punch
and choke his victims, breaking the nose of one and causing another
to have a miscarriage.
   Lin killed a woman after he unsuccessfully tried to rape her Oct.
16, the report said. She died when Lin stuffed his handkerchief into
her mouth and he later cut up the body trying to hide the evidence,
the newspaper said.
   Executions in China generally are carried out with a single
bullet to the back of the head.

<TEXT>
   Calls were pouring in from people wanting
to adopt a newborn abandoned on Christmas but the infertile couple
who found ``Baby Nicholas'' will not get special consideration,
officials said Tuesday.
   ``It's not a `finders keepers' situation,'' said John Runde, a
spokesman for the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services.
   Steve and Robbi Carroll discovered the baby Sunday wrapped in a
patchwork quilt in the parking garage at Sarasota Memorial Hospital
and took him into the hospital, where staff members nicknamed him
``Baby Nicholas,'' in honor of St. Nicholas.
   The baby, almost 7 pounds with brown hair and blue eyes, was
estimated to be three to four days old Tuesday. He was found clean,
well-cared for and had a bottle of warm formula with him.
   ``We found him and we should get to keep him,'' said Robbi
Carroll, 33. ``We both fell instantly in love with him. He's such a
pretty baby. I don't understand how anybody could abandon him.''
   But it's more important to do what's best for the baby _ and
that's placing him with an approved, permanent family as soon as
possible, said Bob Miller, the executive director of the Gulf Coast
division of Children's Home Society in St. Petersburg.
   Miller's private agency has 50 families already approved to
receive an infant, a process that can take several months, he said.
   If the baby is put up for adoption, a private agency, such as
Children's Home Society, probably will handle the case, Runde said.
   But first, state officials will try to find the parents or other
relatives of the baby, said Argylene Bridges, a foster care adoption
supervisor with HRS.
   Police were in the last stage of the investigation, calling area
hospitals about recent births, said Sarasota police spokesman Mike
Schott. Sarasota Memorial officials say they're certain the infant
was not born at their hospital.
   Miller's agency had received some 60 calls about Baby Nicholas.
Mrs. Bridges said she received a couple of dozen.
   Steve Carroll, 30, called the baby a ``a gift from heaven'' and
said that he hopes he and his wife can adopt him. The Sarasota
couple have been married for 13 months but said they are unable to
have children of their own.
   ``We had talked about adoption last year when we first got
married,'' he said. ``A lot of people told us we could have put him
in the car and drove off, but we would have had to live with our
conscience.'' Carroll said.
   The Carrolls were coming to the hospital to visit Robbi Carroll's
mother when they found the baby.

<TEXT>
   Once known as ``the city of hate,'' Dallas again
feels the nation's critical stare, this time over a judge who said
he gave a killer a lenient sentence in part because the victims were
``queers.''
   ``This is another blow to the image of Dallas, which is why
they're treating it so seriously,'' said attorney Don Maison, who
has represented the Dallas Gay Alliance. ``Dallas doesn't like to be
embarrassed.''
   State District Judge Jack Hampton made the remark Dec. 16 in
explaining to the Times Herald why he sentenced an 18-year-old to 30
years in prison instead of life. The minimum sentence was five years.
   ``These two guys that got killed wouldn't have been killed if
they hadn't been cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,''
Hampton said. ``I don't much care for queers cruising the streets
picking up teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy.''
   In a city of just under 1 million and an estimated homosexual
population of 80,000, those words sparked protests from residents
and civil liberties groups. Some charged that the remarks could
spell ``open season'' on homosexuals.
   Elected officials such as state Treasurer Ann Richards and Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., expressed outrage.
   For Dallas, which became known to many as the ``city of hate''
after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, it was another
of the reminders _ including racial incidents and the 25th
anniversary of the assassination _ that have reinforced the city's
reputation among some as an uncaring place.
   Hampton has since apologized to a group of ministers for his
``poor choice of words.'' But gay rights leaders said that's not
enough and are pressing for his resignation. A complaint was filed
with the state judicial conduct commission that could result in
Hampton's removal.
   The judge did not return calls from The Associated Press, and
after issuing his apology Thursday left town for the holidays.
   Hampton sentenced Richard Lee Bednarski on Nov. 28 for the
murders May 15 of Tommy Lee Trimble, 34, and Lloyd Griffin, 27, who
were shot three times each.
   Testimony indicated that Bednarski, who had no prior criminal
record, was part of a group of youths who went to an area frequented
by homosexuals with the intention of harassing them.
   Bednarski persuaded another youth to join him in robbing Trimble
and Griffin, who had invited the boys into their car. Testimony did
not reveal whether the victims actually solicited sex from the two
youths.
   William Waybourn, president of the Dallas Gay Alliance, said
reports to his organization of violence against homosexuals are on
the rise. ``I think there's an epidemic of violence against gays
because of AIDS, the fear of AIDS,'' he said.
   He cited an educator at his group's AIDS Resource Center who was
beaten with a baseball bat in October by two men who yelled an
epithet for homosexual.
   Many members of the legal community would not discuss Hampton's
case specifically but said the publicity about the case could hurt
the judiciary.
   State District Judge Jesse Oliver said, ``I think there is always
a concern about things that put judges and the judiciary on the
front page and on the six o'clock news. It doesn't do very much for
the image of the judiciary.''
   Mike Joplin, president of the Dallas Bar Association, said he
does not believe anti-homosexual bias prevails in the Dallas legal
system. Some lawyers disagreed.
   M. William Nelson, a lawyer who estimates half his clients are
gay, said he believes judges in Dallas in general have
anti-homosexual prejudices.
   ``But most of them are going to have the good sense not to tell
them to a reporter who's sitting there writing down every word you
say,'' he said.
   He added, however, that Hampton is generally a fair judge and has
shown compassion toward prisoners with AIDS.
   Other lawyers who consider themselves friends of Hampton said
they believe his opinion on homosexuality is shared by a majority of
the community.
   Lawyer Bill McKnight, one of about 50 people who demonstrated in
support of Hampton on Thursday, blamed the ``lunatic fringe,'' the
``liberal media'' and groups such as the American Civil Liberties
Union for the national attention the case has brought to Dallas.

   A man fleeing police ran a red light and
rammed into the side of a car at 80 mph Tuesday, killing a woman and
her four daughters in a fiery explosion that threw the car's engine
more than 50 yards, police said.
   ``It just exploded,'' said Dave Bolognone, who witnessed the
accident. ``As soon as it hit the other car, there was a giant
explosion and everything was spinning. It was crazy. There was
nothing you could do.''
   Police Capt. John Rockwell said an officer spotted a car speeding
and began pursuing it just as the accident occurred.
   ``You can't really call it a chase,'' Rockwell said.
   The fleeing car struck the other car as it was making a turn at
an intersection.
   The identities of the dead were not immediately released, and no
charges had been filed by late Tuesday.
   The driver of the fleeing car was listed in poor condition at
Grant Medical Center.

<HEAD>Western Firms Sign Up For Joint Ventures In Soviet Union</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of Western firms have teamed up
with Soviet enterprises to take advantage of new rules allowing
joint ventures as part of Moscow's push for ``perestroika.''
   The new partnerships, many still in the planning stages, may
eventually offer Soviets a variety and quantity of goods and
services not readily available in their underdeveloped economy.
   They also may give Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev some of
the Western technology, know-how, money and management expertise
sorely needed in his program of perestroika _ the drive to
restructure the lumbering economy.
   ``The Soviets have much more to gain from this generally than
Western partners,'' said Jan Vanous, research director of PlanEcon,
a Washington-based firm specializing in forecasting economic trends
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``They need to improve their economy on the domestic side and one
instrument of course would be to improve foreign economic
relations,'' said a NATO official who demanded anonymity.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., has urged caution.
   ``We should applaud perestroika, but we shouldn't pay for it,''
he said in an interview on the ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.''
   Bradley said the economic reforms appear directed at cutting
Soviet defense expenditures and bolstering the civilian sector.
   ``To the extent that trade and joint ventures can promote that
kind of reform, then I think it's in our interest,'' he said. ``To
the extent that it retards it, I don't think it's in our interest.''
   Vladimir Kamentsev, head of the Soviet's State Foreign Economic
Commission, recently said 159 joint ventures with foreign partners
have been registered. Analysts said this likely includes some
arrangements with East European countries as well.
   Some of the reported deals are:
   _ The West German electrical giant Siemens has proposed a $560
million joint venture to build an atomic power reactor. A German
tavern owner wants to open a pub in Leningrad.
   _ The British joint venture Rank Xerox plans to team up with the
Soviet state publishing group FTO Vneshtorgizdat for a photocopying
shop in Moscow. The deal is worth less than $1.8 million.
   _ A consortium led by Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. has agreed to
conduct feasibility studies on a proposed $5 billion chemical
project in Western Siberia. The project would involve building 15
chemical plants. Another Japanese company, Raduga, is interested in
sports and health centers.
   _ Spain's Telefonica de Espana will make telephones with the
Soviet Ministry for Production of Communication Media at a factory
in the Ural Mountains. Another Spanish firm, Kelme, has joined with
the Soviet State Committee for Sports to turn out sports shoes in
Leningrad, Kiev and outside Moscow.
   _ In Italy, Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi's Enichem is considering
two petrochemical joint ventures, including a $6 billion project
with Occidental Petroleum and two other international partners.
   The Italian clothing chain Stefanel wants to open two shops in
Leningrad. Also, the agricultural concern Ferruzzi has agreed to
build an agro-industrial prototype on 1.2 million acres of Ukrainian
farmland.
   _ Finnair, the Finnish airline, has signed up with the Soviet
tourist agency Intourist on a hotel project for foreign visitors.
Ireland's Aer Rianta wants to work with the Soviet airliner Aeroflot
on an airport duty-free shop.
   There's no indication how many of the partnerships have actually
begun operations, but analysts believe the number is small and their
investments are limited.
   According to reports cited by analysts, about 500 million rubles
_ roughly $830 million _ has been committed in capital by both
Soviet and foreign partners. An estimated one-third of the total has
been put up by the West.
   ``It's a very slow process,'' said Vanous. ``Nobody is doing any
volume of production.''
   ``There is still a lot of chaos and confusion,'' added Willy
Vandenberghe, spokesman at the Belgian Foreign Trade Ministry. ``It
is still a very young phenomenon.''
   Ralph Land, a general manager of Britain's Rank Xerox, said
negotiations to open the photocopying shop in Moscow were lengthy.
   ``We didn't always speak the same language,'' he said. ``I'm not
talking about English and Russian. Our concept of profitability, our
concept of cash flow, our concept of depreciation were different.''
   Dutch electronics giant Philips has no plans to follow others'
lead.
   ``Joint ventures are like marriages _ you've got to know each
other very well before you plunge into it,'' said spokesman Jan van
Schagen. ``Right now, Philips and the Soviet Union aren't even
engaged.''
   The Soviet Union issued a decree on Jan. 13, 1987 _ and
legislation was approved months later _ permitting the formation of
joint ventures with foreign partners.
   Only about two dozen were registered in 1987, but the campaign
picked up in 1988.
   Western companies have been lured by a potential market of 280
million consumers.
   The analysts suggested the partnership push has been prompted by
the Soviets' desire to boost consumers' living standards, expand
export capacity with more competitive goods, and gain access to
Western technology, know-how and management skills.
   The Soviets also, according to these analysts, want to limit
imports from the West which require them to make payments in scarce
hard currency, such as dollars. The ruble is not convertable outside
the Soviet Union, making it viturally worthless.
   The Soviet Union recently sought to ease restrictions on these
arrangements by scrapping the limit on foreigners' share of a joint
venture and allowing a foreigner to head the operation.
   Hiring and firing rules have been simplified. Tax breaks have
been offered to manufacturers willing to put up factories for
consumer goods, medicine, trucks and high technology, as well as to
joint ventures operating in the Soviet Far East.
   Even so, Western companies still face difficulties.
   They cannot convert profits made in rubles into dollars or other
hard currencies and take them out of the country. The Soviet economy
cannot provide an adequate and reliable supply of goods companies
need in their operations. And Westerners must deal with an
entrenched Soviet bureaucracy that can slow business ventures.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20.
The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5 points, for example,
for Republicans.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and

<TEXT>
   A congressman who has been a perennial budget
workhorse and a senator who has spent his career focused on other
issues will be marquee players in what should be one of 1989's most
clamorous political clashes: how to cut the federal deficit.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., each
are becoming chairmen of their chamber's budget committees in time
to wrestle with $35 billion in needed deficit cuts. And incoming
president George Bush has pledged to achieve the cuts without new
taxes.
   Both lawmakers are in general agreement that mopping up the red
ink with spending cuts alone is a dubious approach. In interviews,
Sasser said making up the shortfall without new taxes makes it
``less likely that you'll have success,'' while Panetta said what
are needed are spending cuts and ``You have to raise revenues.''
   The two men are also lawyers, but similarities between them don't
go much further.
   Panetta, 50, is from Monterey, Calif., and began his political
life as a liberal Republican. He left the GOP after losing his job
as director of the Civil Rights Office in President Nixon's
Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1970 after
complaining about the agency's lack of aggressiveness.
   He gravitated to the Democratic Party, but still keeps an
autographed picture in his office of the late Earl Warren, the GOP
California governor who became the liberal chief justice of the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   Sasser, 50, was chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party from
1973 to 1976, a tenure that ended with his defeat of incumbent GOP
Sen. William E. Brock. The Memphis native, who has been re-elected
easily twice since then, is a moderate liberal who has prospered in
a conservative state by tending to its needs on the Appropriations
Committee and by taking populist positions against government waste
and high interest rates.
   Panetta has worked on budget matters since coming to Congress in
1977. In 1981, he was chosen by House Democratic leaders to help
find $37 billion in spending cuts that newly elected President
Reagan had rammed through Congress. The job pitted the green
lawmaker against House committee chairmen schooled in protecting
their turf, and Panetta to this day calls that period his toughest
budget battle ever.
   He also helped shape the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, and
was a negotiator at last year's budget summit between Reagan
administration officials and congressional leaders. Colleagues from
both parties say they respect his knowledge of the budget's
intricacies and consider him fair.
   ``He really knows what makes the budget tick and what makes it
explode,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican
on the Senate Budget Committee. ``He'll be a team player for the
Democrats, but that doesn't mean he'll turn fiscal and budget policy
into a partisan confrontation.''
   ``He's a workaholic,'' says Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., one of
three lawmakers with whom Panetta shares a Capitol Hill townhouse
during the week. ``We'll all have dinner and then go upstairs to
watch TV, and he'll go back to his office and work until 1 a.m.''
   Panetta says his years in the GOP give him ``a pretty good sense
of how Republicans think,'' and many members of that party give him
high marks for fairness.
   Some Republicans, however, have never forgotten that Panetta
oversaw the 1985 House task force that ruled that a disputed House
race in Indiana had been won by the Democratic candidate by four
votes. At the time, fellow task force member Rep. William M. Thomas,
R-Calif., accused him of political ``rape.''
   Sasser has been on the budget committee for all of his dozen
years in the Senate, but he has not been considered a leading player
in the field and admits that the subject has not been the focus of
his attention.
   But he says, ``I don't feel like a neophyte ... and I don't
underestimate the difficulty of the task.''
   The Tennessean is best known for speaking out against
administration policies in Central America and picking through
government spending looking for waste and fraud. He was chosen to
deliver his party's response to a Reagan speech on Nicaragua in
early 1986, but for the most part has received little national
publicity.
   ``He's not a real attention-grabber,'' says Lance Simmens, a
former Sasser aide who is now a lobbyist. ``He's more in the mold of
a judge who sits back and listens to both sides and doesn't shoot
from the lip.''
   Sasser says he believes the Reagan budgets of the last eight
years have not devoted enough resources to domestic programs such as
education, health care and transportation and sewage systems. Yet he
says he will not try to force his views on his committee.
   ``I want to come up with an approach that would try to hold a
consensus within the committee for certain budget priorities,'' he
says.
   He insists he has no preference for whether new taxes are needed,
but says of Bush's campaign pledges to beef up education and
child-care programs, ``I don't see how he can realize those
initiatives without addressing revenues.''
   Panetta is more direct. He says that if Bush is flexible on the
question of taxes, cooperation between the White House and Congress
would be likely.
   ``If he fails to do that, we in Congress certainly are not going
to abandon our responsibility,'' he said. ``We will have to proceed,
but it will become much tougher for us to do our job.''

<HEAD>Bush Will Try To Succeed Where Others Have Failed in Education
Reform</HEAD>

   For George Bush to succeed in his quest to go
down in history as ``the education president,'' he will have to spur
American schools to achieve results that have proved elusive despite
intensive reform efforts.
   The gaping federal budget deficit will make it difficult for Bush
to find new money for schools beyond what he promised during the
presidential campaign.
   If Bush concentrates instead on simply trying to advance
education through use of the bully pulpit, he may find Ronald Reagan
has already played that role to the hilt.
   Reagan never said he wanted to be an education president. When he
entered the White House, the main item on his education agenda was
to abolish the Department of Education. He failed, and was largely
rebuffed on repeated attempts to cut billions of dollars from
federal school programs.
   But Reagan also presided over the most intense and prolonged
period of school reforms in the nation's history.
   His first secretary of education, T.H. Bell, commissioned the
1983 report, ``A Nation at Risk,'' that triggered efforts in most
states to raise school standards. His second secretary, William J.
Bennett, made headlines pillorying the education establishment and
championing parents' rights in public education.
   The public responded to the alarms sounded in ``A Nation at
Risk'' and the literally dozens of other dire-sounding reports that
followed it by pouring more money into the schools. The average
public school teacher today makes nearly $30,000 a year; salaries
have risen 45 percent since 1982, double the rate of inflation.
   But there has been little evidence to date of any dramatic
improvements in educational achievement. More than a quarter of
American teenagers drop out of high school. There have been only
piddling gains in Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, which fell
steadily from 1963 to 1980. And among major developed nations,
Americans continue to bring up the rear in comparisons of students'
knowledge of math and science.
   Lauro F. Cavazos, the recently appointed secretary of education
whom Bush has asked to stay on, said in a recent interview,
``Although we have made some advancements, we've fallen back in some
other areas. ... We have not been able to stem the tide of dropouts.
Our literacy numbers are terrible.''
   Cavazos is convinced the American people ``must not recognize the
seriousness of the problem, or else they'd have gone out and done
something about it.''
   Bush has said repeatedly he does not envision any massive new
social spending programs.
   He has said the nation must spend ``more wisely'' on education,
and he has said educators must be held ``to the highest standards of
accountability.'' He has voiced support for giving parents more
choices within public education, for career ladders for teachers and
for alternate certification of new teachers.
   The cornerstone of his campaign promise to be an ``education
president'' is a new, $500 million ``merit schools'' program that
would reward high achieving schools that have large numbers of
disadvantaged students with unfettered grants of up to $100,000.
Bush has said it will be up to the states to set the criteria for
choosing the winners.
   He also has promised to ask Congress for an additional $50
million in matching grants to states for magnet schools, and he
wants to boost to $50 million a $6 million fund to finance
experiments in school reform.
   Congress appropriated $21.9 billion for the Education Department
for fiscal 1989, or $7 billion more than its budget in 1981 when
Reagan moved into the White House.
   The nation's total education bill has risen steadily in the
1980s, from $183 billion in 1980-81 to an estimated $328 billion for
the current school year. The kindergarten-to-grade 12 share of that
bill has gone from $112 billion to $196 billion. Adjusted for
inflation, it is up 26 percent.
   Education groups say the federal share has not kept pace with
inflation. The government, which kicked in more than 9 percent of
local public school bills in 1980, now pays just 6.2 percent. Most
of the federal money is targeted on programs for the poor, the
handicapped and students who speak little or no English.
   Likewise, federal aid for college is also targeted on the needy,
although middle-class students also benefit from loan subsidies and
work-study programs.
   Congress and Reagan have beaten Bush to the punch on one campaign
promise: tax-free U.S. Savings Bonds for parents to save for college
tuition, starting next July. College lobbyists have welcomed that
step, but say it primarily will help middle- and upper-income
families that can afford to save, not the needy.
   Bush has reiterated plans to hold a summit next year with the
nation's governors, education leaders and others to discuss the
problems of the schools and how to solve them.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
said, ``It sounds like a conference at which he tells the governors
that it's their job.'' But he added, ``Anything that keeps education
on the front burner is good.''
   ``We've made some little bit of progress _ very little,'' said
Shanker. ``I think if you had a commission up there today, they'd
have to say the nation is still at risk.''
   Business leaders have become increasingly visible in the school
reform movement, serving both as boosters and gadflies. The
Committee for Economic Development has called for massive increases
in spending on such programs as Head Start and the Chapter One
remedial program. Without a better educated work force, they argue,
the United States can only lose ground to its competitors in the
international marketplace.
   At a Joint Economic Committee hearing Dec. 14, John Brademas,
president of New York University and a former congressman, said,
``Education is the perfect issue with which Republican President
George Bush can build bridges to a Democratic Congress.''
   He urged that Bush throw his weight behind a bipartisan effort to
expand international studies and research, including the teaching of
foreign languages, rebuild deteriorating campus labs and scientific
facilities, and provide grants instead of loans to needy college
students.

<HEAD>State Officials Fear Federal Anti-Drug Funds Drying Up</HEAD>

   A curtailment of federal grants has left state
government officials wondering if their new drug enforcement
programs may share the fate of drug busts gone sour.
   State and local anti-drug programs _ begun with such promise just
two years ago _ could be crippled or even killed unless the federal
government provides sufficient money, officials say.
   It was Congress, in the election-year 1986 anti-drug bill, that
urged the states to establish multiyear drug law enforcement
programs in order to receive new grant money.
   States and localities responded by hiring new police officers,
prosecutors and lab technicians, and by having clusters of police
forces band together in regional drug operations.
   Now state officials are accusing Congress of unashamedly claiming
credit for the state-local assistance program and then failing to
deliver on the promise to provide sufficient money.
   ``People feel mega-dollars are flowing to the states ... to
benefit local programs,'' said Bruce Feldman, executive director of
Pennsylvania's Drug Policy Council. ``That's really not the case.
We're having to fight that PR battle.''
   J. David Coldren of the Illinois Criminal Justice Information
Authority said, ``This is all smoke and mirrors. There's less money
per pound of rhetoric than ever before.''
   ``The states are right,'' said Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J.,
chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime. ``We can't
have a love affair one year and the next year walk away from the
state and local assistance program. We have treated the states
shabbily.''
   Hughes promised to fight for additional funds, and blamed the
curtailment on the Reagan administration, which has tried to
eliminate the program.
   The lawmaker said, ``We were lucky to hold onto what we had.''
   Barbara Clay, spokeswoman for the White House Office of
Management and Budget, said, ``We believe federal money would be
more appropriately spent on federal drug efforts, such as U.S.
attorneys, prisons and the Drug Enforcement Administration, where
there would be a national impact.
   ``We believe state and local governments have obligations to
increase their own budgets for their own localized activities,''
Clay said.
   According to the Federal Funds Information for States, a project
of state legislative and governors' associations, grants distributed
under a congressional formula totaled $178.4 million in fiscal 1987,
dropped to $55.6 million in fiscal 1988 and made a partial comeback
_ to $118.8 million _ in fiscal 1989.
   The gap between the first and third years actually is greater,
because in 1987, states could supplement their grant money with an
additional $35.5 million in separate justice assistance funds.
   For the 1989 fiscal year, the justice assistance program was
combined with the state-local grants program, thus eliminating the
additional source of funds.
   Many states used their first-year money to establish regional
police operations in which small- and medium-sized departments
banded together to fight drug dealers.
   New officers were hired solely for the anti-drug effort, and new
equipment, such as surveillance vans, was purchased.
   Some states needed to move cases to court faster, and they hired
more prosecutors, crime laboratory technicians and lab analysis
equipment.
   In one of the more novel programs, Illinois established a
``lending arsenal,'' allowing local police to borrow from the state
police an array of equipment they couldn't afford to buy.
   Miami used grant money for a reverse sting operation in which
police drove drug dealers out of an area, substituted undercover
officers as sellers, and then arrested the buyers.
   Tom Quinn, executive director of the Criminal Justice Council,
which represents states on crime issues, accused federal lawmakers
of ``penny-pinching in the area of our largest concern, the drug
problem.''
   ``We have not had to drop anything we started, but we can't
expand,'' Pennsylvania's Feldman said. ``We need $5 million to
maintain the programs we have.''
   Coldren said that in Illinois the drop in funding has meant ``We
had to freeze out a number of counties that would love to have drug
programs.''
   In Maryland, Capt. Thomas Carr, commander of the state police
narcotics division, said his state's programs could keep operating
another year.
   ``It remains to be seen where we're going to go in the following
year, but all of us know the drug problem is not going to go away in
a year,'' he said.
   Florida made only a two-year commitment to local agencies,
knowing it could maintain the programs for that period, said John
Lenaerts, an official in the state Department of Community Affairs.
   ``If we establish a program, we don't cut them off at the
knees,'' he said.
   G. Albert Howenstein Jr., director of the California Office of
Criminal Justice Planning, said, ``To this point, we have been able
to sustain the program. But down the road, if we continue at the
same level (of financing), by the end of the third year ... we will
see a negative implication.''
   In Montana, the scaled-down money will leave the north central
area of the state without any anti-drug programs, said Marv Dye,
finance manager for the crime control division of the state Justice
Department.
   And in Texas, where some grant money is used to stop drugs on the
southern border, there's ``a strong possibility'' of program
eliminations or across-the-board reductions, said John Coffel,
director of the state's narcotics control program.

<HEAD>New Tax Forms To Have a Few Surprises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 101 million tax forms being mailed out
starting today will contain a surprise for some taxpayers. The forms
they receive will be different and simpler than the ones the
Internal Revenue Service mailed to them last year.
   Despite widespread grumbling that the drive toward tax
simplification has instead produced a more complicated system, the
IRS is predicting that 3.5 million Americans will be able to switch
to the simpler forms this year.
   To help make that projection come true, the IRS is making a
greater effort this year to direct taxpayers to the form that is
best for their tax situations.
   The IRS formerly mailed taxpayers the type of form they had used
in the previous year. However, for the first time this year, the IRS
analyzed the returns taxpayers sent back last April 15 and used
those findings to determine what type of package to send for the new
filing season.
   ``Instead of routinely sending out the same form people used in
the past, we are trying to send them the tax package that best suits
their needs,'' says IRS spokesman Frank Keith.
   The landmark 1986 Tax Reform Act reduced tax rates, raised the
standard deduction and eliminated a variety of deductions. Those
changes mean many taxpayers who once found it beneficial to itemize
deductions and file the long Form 1040 can now use the simpler Form
1040A or the simplest form of all, the 1040EZ, without being forced
to pay higher taxes.
   The tax packages, which cost the government $29.4 million to
print and mail, have been waiting at post offices around the country
for the past several weeks with instructions to begin delivering
them today.
   The mass mailing is the largest the government does each year and
traditionally is scheduled for the period right after Christmas.
   For the first time this year, the IRS is supplying estimates of
how long it is likely to take taxpayers to fill out the various
forms. This information, IRS officials hope, will encourage
Americans to use the simplest form possible.
   The IRS estimates that Form 1040 will require a taxpayer to spend
3 hours and 7 minutes on record keeping, 2 hours and 28 minutes
learning about the law, 3 hours and 7 minutes preparing the form and
35 minutes for copying, assembling and sending the return to the IRS.
   The 9 hours and 17 minutes total does not count an additional 5
hours and 51 minutes the agency estimates a taxpayer will need to
fill out an accompanying Schedule A, used if the taxpayer itemizes
deductions, and Schedule B, used to list income from interest and
dividends.
   By contrast, the IRS estimates a taxpayer needs only 1 hour and
31 minutes to complete the 1040EZ, the simplest IRS form which can
be used only by single people who do not itemize and who have
taxable income below $50,000.
   The 1040A, the other short form, may be used by married or single
people who do not itemize and whose taxable income is less than
$50,000.
   As in years past, officials were estimating that three-fourths of
all taxpayers will receive refunds. The typical refund last filing
season was $914.74.
   In addition to mailing tax packages, the IRS makes the forms
available at many banks, post offices and libraries.
   The IRS said taxpayers should notice few changes this year,
unlike last year when taxpayers had to confront for the first time
the sweeping changes made by the 1986 Tax Reform Act.
   Among the changes that will show up in the 1988 tax forms:
   _Tax rates will be reduced, reflecting the lower rates that took
effect starting last Jan. 1. Under the new law, most people fall
into either the 15 percent or 28 percent tax bracket, although some
affluent taxpayers pay a hidden 33 percent tax rate on some of their
income.
   _The individual exemption has been increased from $1,900 to
$1,950, while the standard deduction for those who do not itemize
will go up as well. For single people, the standard deduction goes
from $2,450 to $3,000. The deduction for a married couple filing
jointly rises from $3,760 to $5,000.
   _Clarifying language and graphics have been added to help people
select the proper standard deduction and the correct dependency
status, two areas which proved confusing on last year's forms.

   With part of the holiday gorging season still
to go, a consumer advocacy group is offering a list of food and
nutrition tips as New Year's resolutions.
   ``During 1988, the surgeon general let Americans know that what
we eat has a lot to do with our health,'' says Public Voice for Food
and Health Policy. ``That means the nation's chief doctor has added
his voice to other public health authorities, including the American
Heart Association and the National Cancer Institute, in strongly
advocating a diet lower in fat and higher in fiber.''
   Therefore, Public Health said, in the coming year, ``Give
yourself a longer and healthier life'' by observing a few simple
rules in the supermarket, at restaurants and at neighborhood schools.
   Guidelines urged by the Washington-based group include:
   _Read nutrition labels and try to choose lower-fat foods. Keep
total fat per day to about 80 grams for men and about 60 for women.
Watch for ``hidden fat'' in processed foods. Gourmet ice cream, for
example, can have up to 20 grams of fat in one serving.
   _Buy ``Select'' beef, the leanest grade, rather than the fattier
``Prime'' or ``Choice'' grades.
   _Beware of highly saturated coconut or palm oil in prepared
foods. Look for it in the ingredients statement, particularly on
baked goods.
   _If there is no nutrition label on the supermarket's own brand of
food, ask for it.
   _Get involved in what children are eating in school. Work with
the PTA and school dietician to encourage the school to offer more
nutritious lunches and snacks, including those in vending machines.
Those should be lower in fat, sodium and sugar, and higher in fiber.
   _Buy whole-grain bread and rolls for sandwiches and side dishes.
   _Seek out lower-fat alternatives to ice cream, such as ice milk,
frozen yogurt, sherbets, sorbets or frozen fruit juice bars.
   _Try to use fresh fruits for desserts and sweet snacks. Look for
creative recipes in health-conscious cook books.
   Public Voice also said that when dining out, look for ``heart
healthy'' menu items as recommended by the American Heart
Association. If no special menu items are listed, ask for them.
Choose meals that are baked, broiled or grilled, without heavy
sauces.
   ``Ask restaurants to provide healthier kids' menus, going beyond
traditional hot dogs, hamburgers and french fries,'' the group said.
``See if you can order half an adult portion of a lower-fat menu
item, such as one grilled chicken breast instead of two.''

   An annual report by the Agriculture Department
shows how drought-reduced yields and market forces have chewed into
the nation's stockpile of surplus commodities.
   The department's Commodity Credit Corp. said that as of Sept. 30,
it had $13.9 billion invested in commodity loans and inventories,
compared with a total of $26.8 billion a year earlier.
   For example, corn and other feed grains totaled more than 3.25
billion bushels as of Sept. 30 and were valued at $7.8 billion. A
year earlier, feed grains held by CCC under loan and owned outright
as inventory totaled 6.1 billion bushels worth $14.3 billion.
   Wheat holdings by CCC were put at 812.9 million bushels valued at

   The nation's egg-laying flock of hens is about
4 percent smaller than it was at this time last year, but the birds
are working a little harder, according to the Agriculture Department.
   As of Dec. 1, an estimated 275 million layers were in the egg
flocks, down from about 286 million a year earlier, says the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board.
   But the Dec. 1 rate of lay averaged 68.8 eggs per 100 birds,
compared with 68.5 eggs a year earlier, the board said in its recent
report.

<TEXT>
   Congress is sprucing up for its 101st two-year
session and the celebration of 200 years of constitutional
government.
   One more bicentennial as the century nears a close.
   The Senate chamber in particular will have a fresher look when it
convenes Jan. 3.
   A new carpet has been installed _ royal blue with medallions _
and the staff benches in the rear have been reupholstered in bright
crimson. It should give the chamber a flashier look on television.
   A few months ago, the staff area in the back corners of the
Senate chamber were enclosed with massive mahogany railings. That
also was done with television in mind.
   Some senators with desks in the rear of the chamber had
complained that when they rose to speak, the television image of the
speech showed them with rows of dangling feet and crossed legs at
the level of their own heads. The new railing provides a more
senatorial visual backdrop.
   The taking up of the old carpet, which had been in place for more
than a decade and was badly worn in places, was an event in itself.
   Workmen in jeans and casual clothes took the places of senators
in crisp three-piece, pinstriped suits.
   Some lounged in senator's arm chairs, told jokes in loud voices,
flicked cigarette ashes on the chamber floor and ground out the
butts with their heels.
   Then they carried the 100 historic desks out of the chamber door
and propelled them down the corridor to temporary storage.
   Then they tore up the carpet.
   ``Looks just like the revolution,'' one bystander said.
   The tearing up of the carpet attracted spectators _ and souvenir
hunters. A few of the latter were United States senators.
   Senators, and Senate pages and clerks, rolled up swatches of the
old carpet and carried it away on their shoulders.
   The chamber now has been restored to order, ready for noon on
Jan. 3 when 10 newly elected senators, one newly appointed senator
and 23 newly re-elected senators will raise their right hands and
swear to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States
against all enemies, foreign and domestic.''
   All seats in the Senate galleries have been allocated to
relatives, friends and supporters of the new and returning senators.
   For the first time, a spillover room has been set up for guests
of the new and re-elected senators who cannot be seated in the
Senate chamber itself. They will be issued tickets for seats in the
Senate Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building where they
will view the swearing-in ceremonies on a 9-by-12-foot video screen.
   The actual swearing in will be followed by a re-enactment in the
Old Senate Chamber.
   The reason: A photo opportunity, a chance for each senator to be
photographed with President-elect Bush acting in his vice
presidential role as president of the Senate.
   The following day, Jan. 4, Bush will preside over a joint session
of Congress in the chamber of the House of Representatives for the
counting of the votes of members of the Electoral College.
   There Bush, acting again as vice president, will announce that he
has been elected president of the United States.

   Japanese companies spent a record $33.8 billion last
year on entertainment and gifts, according to the National Tax
Administration Agency.
   The agency, in a report released Monday, said spending by
hospitals and the life insurance industry was highest at $77,980 per
firm.
   The 4.19 trillion yen total for entertainment spending last year
represented an average daily expenditure of $91.9 million _ a 6.1
percent increase over 1986, when wining and dining clients cost
companies a total of $31.8 billion, the agency said.
   Japanese executives are often given carte blanche to entertain at
exclusive nightclubs and inns, where an evening meal can cost $500
or more.
   Inviting clients for rounds of golf and exchanging gifts are
other customary entertainment expenses.
   The agency said Japanese firms spent an additional $2.87 billion
on donations to political organizations in 1987, a 16.2 percent
increase over the previous year.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino swore in 25
new generals today in a move her defense chief said would improve
military effectiveness in dealing with Communist insurgents.
   Ten of the new generals came from the army, five from the
Philippine Constabulary, five from the air force, four from the navy
and one from the medical service corps.
   Mrs. Aquino made no statement during the brief ceremony, but
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told reporters the promotions will
``improve the chain of command, which will result in a more
efficient operation and thereby contribute to the further stability
of the country.''
   The new generals brought to 93 the number of flag officers in the
160,000-member armed forces, which faces a 20-year-old nationwide
Communist insurgency and a smouldering Moslem revolt in the south.
   On Monday, the military accused Communist rebels of violating a
Christmas cease-fire on five occasions, including an ambush Sunday
in Iloilo province in which one soldier was killed.
   Both Mrs. Aquino and the rebel New People's Army called
unilateral cease-fires for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
Unilateral truces will also go into effect at the New Year.

<HEAD>Reagan's Ratings: Popular Personally, Less So On Policies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan leaves office with his personal
popularity intact, but with Americans viewing him unfavorably on
many policy issues, a Media General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Most respondents viewed Reagan's performance negatively on social
and governmental issues such as education and ethics. A majority
also rated his judgment unfavorably.
   Yet Reagan retained his enormous personal approval. A vast
two-thirds endorsed the way he has done his job overall. Many said
history will view him positively and 55 percent said he has made the
country better.
   The national survey of 1,084 adults found two factors at the
heart of Reagan's popularity: high ratings for his leadership and a
belief that his economic policies the past eight years have been
good.
   Reagan also was scored highly for his handling of defense and
U.S.-Soviet relations. And he was seen as an effective president:
More than six in 10 said he has accomplished most of what he set out
to do.
   The survey was conducted Nov. 10-20, shortly after Vice President
George Bush was elected Reagan's successor. Despite Reagan's
popularity, a majority said they would not have supported him for a
third term as president.
   He leaves office Jan. 20.
   Reagan's ratings were high on personal qualities: Two-thirds
ranked his leadership ability as excellent or good and
three-quarters favorably rated his charisma and his ability to
communicate.
   Six in 10 also ranked him positively for his accomplishments in
office overall. But Reagan did less well on another attribute, his
judgment as president, with 53 percent rating him negatively.
   Reagan's popularity flagged on social issues. On civil rights, 51
percent rated him negatively; on education, 54 percent were
negative; on housing, 65 percent; on welfare, 67 percent. Also, six
in 10 rated him negatively on his handling of ethics in government.
   Respondents were about evenly split on another issue, Reagan's
selection of federal judges. But on two other issues he scored
strongly: Seven in 10 rated him favorably on defense, eight in 10 on
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The poll gave four options per issue _ ``excellent'' or ``good''
as positive choices, ``only fair'' or ``poor'' as negatives. Reagan
fared worst among Democrats, but was seen negatively by independents
on several issues. Republicans endorsed him on most issues, but not
on the deficit, welfare or housing.
   Reagan's ratings were mixed even on economics. While nearly
two-thirds said his economic policies have been beneficial, 80
percent negatively viewed his handling of the federal budget deficit.
   Moreover, 54 percent said the poor are worse off economically as
a result of his policies, and 72 percent said wealthy Americans are
better off. Opinion was more divided on the middle class: a third
called it worse off, a quarter said it was better off and the rest
saw little change.
   Thirty-five percent said they and their families were better off
as a result of Reagan's efforts, to just 18 percent worse off. But
when asked to score his handling of the economy, respondents split _
half viewing him positively, half negatively.
   On another issue, foreign policy excluding Soviet relations, six
in 10 viewed Reagan favorably. The poll was conducted before he
opened contact with the Palestine Liberation Organization this
month, so it did not measure that move's possible effect.
   In nearly all the gauges of his popularity Reagan did best with
young adults, ages 18-29, and worst with the oldest, 65 and over. He
also did considerably better with men: Half the men polled, but just
37 percent of women, said they would have backed Reagan for a third
term if he could have run again.
   The survey, conducted Nov. 10-20, has a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.

   Sandy Duncan says she's happy now that she
doesn't have to hide behind the happy persona she created for her
first television series, ``Funny Face.''
   Miss Duncan developed a benign brain tumor behind an eye while
working on the early 1970s series and going through a divorce. She
attributed her headaches and double vision to stress.
   ``No one knew what was wrong,'' Miss Duncan said in Dec. 31's TV
Guide. ``They kept calling it a nervous breakdown _ `Poor little
thing, all this stress and publicity and a divorce, too.'''
   The tumor eventually was found and removed, although she lost her
vision in one eye.
   She had created the happy-go-lucky personality for ``Funny Face''
and kept it up even after the operation, running around the
hospital, checking on other patients and signing autographs.
   ``I was locked into that perky, cheerful personality,'' she said,
adding that a psychologist warned her she was hiding behind it.
   She met a doctor at the hospital and they married. By mutual
agreement, Miss Duncan kept her appearances to a minimum.
   ``So, I didn't work for a while and that have me a chance to grow
up,'' Miss Duncan said. ``Now I don't need that cute and perky
persona anymore. I'm real clear on who I am.''
   Miss Duncan has remarried entertainer Don Correia, and is the
mother of two boys. She said she now feels completely comfortable
with life on the personal side and with her current television
family, ``The Hogan Family.''
   ``I have made a decision to be happy, and I am,'' Miss Duncan
said.

   Today's ambitious women are ``looking for the
superficial things'' in males, says a group that announced Donald
Trump, Tony Danza and Lou Gossett Jr. are among the year's 10 most
watchable men.
   The list in 1988 represents a variety of attributes that include
attractiveness and success, Suzy Mallery, president of the
15,000-member Manwatchers Inc., said Monday.
   `They want it all, and this year's list has it,'' Ms. Mallery
said. ``Big bulging muscles have never been important, but now
dress, grooming and keeping in good physical shape has become much
more important.
   ``Good manners and communication are equally essential.''
   But women seem to be looking more at looks, Ms. Mallery said.
``Today's ambitious women are looking for the superficial things,
the bright and the savvy. It wasn't that way when we started in
1975,'' she said.
   Also making the grade this year were Paul Newman, Mel Gibson,
Kenny Rogers, John F. Kennedy Jr., Andrew McCarthy, Alan Thicke, and
Tony Curtis.
   Three previous contenders _ Burt Reynolds, Tom Selleck and Don
Johnson _ weren't eligible this year because Manwatchers elevated
them to its Hall of Fame, allowing room for new faces. Previous
inductees include Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford.

   ``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson and his
ex-wife, actress Melanie Griffith, plan to remarry after an 11-year
hiatus during which each went from unknown to star.
   ``No date has been set,'' Johnson's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said
Monday in a statement by telephone from Aspen, Colo. He wouldn't
disclose where the wedding will be or where the couple is spending
the holidays.
   ``Both Don and Melanie wish to enjoy this very special time
together,'' Mintz said. ``In order to provide a sense of dignity and
privacy, there will be no press conference, photo opportunities,
interviews or further statement.''
   Miss Griffith, 31, star of the current hit movie ``Working
Girl,'' married the then-little-known Johnson in 1976. They divorced
the following year. She is the daughter of actress Tippi Hedren.
   She later married, then divorced, actor Steven Bauer, and they
have a 3{-year-old son, Alexander.
   Johnson, 39, recently was romantically involved with entertainer
Barbra Streisand, and the two sang together on the Top 10 adult
contemporary hit ``Till I Loved You.''
   Johnson has a 5-year-old son from his relationship with Patti
D'Arbanville.
   Johnson, who plays the scruffy vice cop Sonny Crockett on the
NBC-TV series, and Miss Griffith have reportedly been living
together in Miami.

<HEAD>Open Enrollment Plan Allowing Students To Switch Districts Too Open
For Some</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A liberal open enrollment law that lets
students switch schools for anything from history class to
extracurricular hockey worries some educators and parents who fear
it could severely unbalance Minnesota schools.
   Residents of small towns are worried that under a new state law
considered the broadest in the nation by educators, too many
students will flee little districts unable to offer the variety of
courses available in bigger districts.
   ``They're deathly afraid they're going to lose their school. It
makes them sick at heart,'' said Richard Pearson, the state
Department of Education's acting manager of district support
services. ``That's unfortunately a real possibility.''
   Under the plan passed by the Legislature in May, the state's
large districts must give students the right to transfer without
giving a reason, beginning in the 1989-90 academic year. The law
permitted some schools to adopt the policy this academic year. It
will apply to smaller districts in 1990-91.
   Schools may refuse students only if the transfer would interfere
with desegregation ratios in Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth, or if
the school is too crowded.
   While the law was intended to enhance academic, not athletic,
opportunities, the Minnesota State High School League, which
regulates sports, also is concerned about the open enrollment plan.
   ``My sense is a lot of people are worried,'' said Dave Stead,
executive director of the league, which has 472 member schools.
   Gary Addington, supervisor of athletics for Rochester public
schools, said he hopes transfers solely for athletic reasons don't
become widespread. ``It could create great inequities between
schools as far as competitiveness,'' he said.
   The Education Commission of the States, headed by Gov. Rudy
Perpich, is planning a national conference on open enrollment and
other education options for Feb. 23-24 in Minneapolis, said Robert
Wedl, deputy commissioner of the state Department of Education.
   Only two districts _ Edina, an affluent Minneapolis suburb, and
rural Sartell in central Minnesota _ met a Sept. 30 deadline to
notify the state they will not admit students from other districts
in 1989-90, Pearson said.
   Sartell's decision was based on lack of classroom space, Pearson
said. Edina, with its highly regarded school systems, said it
wouldn't as a general rule accept transfer students but would review
applications individually, Pearson said.
   Members of a commission appointed by the governor to study
education issues said Edina's decision set a precedent for other
districts to reject open enrollment and could be viewed as a move to
keep minority students out.
   Edina officials deny that, saying parents expressed concern
during school board meetings about students abusing the academic
intent of the law.
   ``The principle abuses are with regard to athletics, specifically
that of students selecting another school district for the purpose
of participating in varsity sports within that school district,
rather than for reasons of quality education,'' Dennis Maetzold, an
Edina school board member, said Monday.
   School officials say they hope districts such as Edina that
decline to accept students across the board will be rare.
   ``We hope they change their minds. We believe it's good public
policy to have open enrollment,'' said Wedl. ``By closing its doors
to its neighbors, it represents a clog in the policy.''

   A whopping art swindle unfolding in a French court
has all the ingredients of a best-selling thriller set in the
highbrow world of museum curators and wealthy collectors.
   Take Paris' venerable Louvre Museum, add a painting by a 17th
century Spanish master, stir in convicted fortune hunters, shady
lawyers and the mysterious death of a wealthy heiress. Voila ... the
De Canson affair.
   The case centers around the purchase of Bartoleme Esteban
Murillo's stunning portrait, ``The Gentleman of Seville,'' for the
Louvre by its head curator of paintings. The curator, Pierre
Rosenberg, was charged last week with dealing in stolen property in
connection with the case.
   The intrigue might well have gone unnoticed had suspicion not
been cast on the Louvre and a host of high-profile lawyers,
including Paul Lombard, who is known for handling the estates of
Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall.
   Lombard was charged last Wednesday with complicity in falsifying
legal documents _ also in connection with the case.
   The legal document at issue is a will falsified by a former bar
manager who stood to inherit paintings worth $50 million from
Suzanne Barou de la Lombardiere de Canson and sold the Murillo to
the Louvre.
   The bar manager, Joelle Pesnel, had befriended the wealthy
heiress and moved into the widow's home in 1983 as a confidante.
   For some time before her 1986 death, Mrs. De Canson was held
prisoner in a locked room, newspapers have reported.
   Miss Pesnel was convicted and jailed a year later for
sequestering Mrs. De Canson and for failing to help her when she was
in danger. Newspapers have linked the heiress' death to the
conditions in which she was kept.
   The Louvre had looked into purchasing the Murillo portrait as
early as 1975, and in 1981, Rosenberg picked up where his
predecessors left off, writing to Mrs. De Canson, who owned the
painting. When the museum received no response, the matter was
dropped.
   But four years later, Rosenberg learned the painting was to be
auctioned by Christie's in London and that it was now the property
of Miss Pesnel.
   The Murillo portrait, however, never went on auction and the
Louvre purchased it in 1985 for five million francs (now $833,000)
from Miss Pesnel through her attorney, Lombard. France has strict
laws forbidding the export and sale of works of art that the state
is interested in obtaining.
   Several years later, during a police probe prompted by Mrs. De
Canson's family members, Miss Pesnel told investigators she
inherited the Murillo and other paintings from her grandmother, who
had received them as a gift from Mrs. De Canson. She produced a will
to prove her story.
   The investigators found Miss Pesnel's grandmother had died four
years before Mrs. De Canson and Miss Pesnel met.
   Miss Pesnel has since been convicted and imprisoned for theft and
falsifying her grandmother's will. A Toulouse attorney who had
recovered some art for Mrs. De Canson, Robert Boissonnet, also was
convicted and sent to jail on the same charges.
   The investigating magistrate, Jean-Pierre Bernard, accused
Rosenberg of purchasing the painting with the knowledge that it was
illegally acquired.
   The Louvre quickly came to its own defense.
   Olivier Chevrillon, head of France's national museums, told
reporters at a news conference Dec. 14: ``The Louvre never had, at
any time or from any source, any reason to doubt the origin of the
Murillo.
   ``It often happens that paintings change hands. This one was on
the market and that could have been the case,'' he said.
   Chevrillon said the museum had no intention of returning the
Murillo to the De Canson family.
   ``We cannot be faulted for not verifying ownership because under
French law, possession of a work of art is considered ownership,''
Chevrillon said.

   A rapist charged with attacking a woman while
on furlough from Patuxent Institution may help doom the
maximum-security prison devoted to treating violent offenders rather
than punishing them.
   Coming on the heels of reports that a Patuxent review board had
granted unsupervised furloughs to a triple murderer, legislative
leaders are threatening to abolish the therapeutic institution,
believed to be the only one of its kind in the country.
   ``I just don't think that it works,'' said R. Clayton Mitchell
Jr., speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates, who has called for
the firing of the prison director, Norma Gluckstern. ``It has proved
it hasn't worked. Furloughs and that sort of thing for those types
ought to be abolished.''
   Criminal justice experts say the furor over Patuxent's early
releases and furloughs epitomizes a national fear of crime that
George Bush exploited to defeat Michael Dukakis in the presidential
campaign.
   The Republican candidate blamed Dukakis after convicted murderer
Willie Horton came to Maryland while on furlough from a
Massachusetts prison and raped a woman.
   ``The majority of the prison systems across the county have been
re-examining their furlough programs in view of the recent national
political campaign,'' said Hardy Rauch, director of standards and
accreditation of prisons for the American Correctional Association
in College Park.
   Patuxent operates independent of the rest of Maryland's penal
system, with a review board that grants furloughs and recommends
paroles based on its determination of whether any of the 710 inmates
have been rehabilitated.
   The prison focuses on therapy to make inmates remorseful for
their crimes.
   Since 1982, five inmates who were sentenced to life terms at
Patuxent have been paroled after spending an average of nine years
in prison, a little more than half the average for inmates sentenced
to life in Maryland's other prisons.
   State and federal statistics for 1987 show that three years after
release, 18 percent of Patuxent inmates were convicted again,
dramatically lower than 47.6 percent for Maryland's other prisons,
and 38 percent for federal prisons.
   But Ms. Gluckstern said she is worried that Patuxent's success in
reforming its inmates will not weigh strongly enough to ensure that
the prison survives.
   ``I'm fearful policy is going to be made on extremes,''
Patuxent's director said. ``The final issue is: Do these people have
a second chance?''
   Some insist they don't.
   ``There is no early release from the grave,'' said Wisconsin
Appeals Court Judge Ralph Adam Fine, an advocate of punishment for
violent offenders.
   The fate of the victim and a future victim is forgotten once a
criminal is convicted, he said.
   Last week, Maryland Corrections Secretary Bishop Robinson called
for sweeping reforms at the prison, changes that would essentially
abolish the institution as it now exists.
   Robinson recommended to a special legislative committee studying
the prison that Patuxent's independent status be revoked and that
prison officials be stripped of their broad authority to put inmates
convicted of violent crimes into furlough and work-release programs.
   But he said the institution should accept prisoners serving terms
of 20 years or less. More than 86 percent of the prisoners now at
Patuxent are serving life or long-term sentences for murder, rape
and armed robbery.
   Ms. Gluckstern acknowledges that many Patuxent's inmates have
committed heinous crimes, but maintains that many criminals can be
responsible members of society after treatment. Patuxent admits just
one in four inmates who apply, based on the review board's judgment
of their capacity to change.
   ``No one gets out of here until they live through their crime,
that rape or that murder or whatever,'' she said. Once inmates
accept responsibility and guilt for their deeds ``they're not going
to go rape or murder again,'' she said, adding, ``It doesn't
guarantee 100 percent success.''
   Patuxent has intermittently come under fire since it was created
in 1955.
   The most recent controversy began in November with the disclosure
that the Patuxent board had given 11 daylong furloughs since April
to Robert Daly Angell, 31, who was sentenced in 1976 to three
consecutive life terms for killing two police officers and a
teen-ager.
   Angell's furloughs outraged Gov. William Donald Schaefer, who
directed aides to revamp the prison's rules for the Legislature's
review.
   Then James M. Stavarakas, a convicted rapist, walked away from a
work release job on Nov. 28. He was captured Dec. 4 in China Grove,
N.C.
   After a warrant was issued charging Stavarakas with rape while he
was missing, Ms. Gluckstern and the prison's independent review
board canceled all leaves as of Dec. 1.

   Fire aboard a ship undergoing repairs killed
two workers and sent two other people to the hospital, authorities
said.
   Monday's fire was started by a welder's spark in an elevator
shaft area, authorities said.
   The men who died were in the hold of the vessel, the All-Alaskan,
which was being converted from an oil drilling rig to a
fish-processing ship, said Larry Schatz, a fire department
dispatcher.
   About 30 Tacoma firefighters responded to the blaze at Pier 23,
said Schatz.
   One firefighter was taken to Tacoma General Hospital for X-rays
for possible broken ribs and a man who had been working on the ship
was treated at St. Joseph Hospital for smoke inhalation and
released, Schatz said.
   The blaze caused no structural damage to the vessel, fire
officials said.
   The ship, owned by All-Alaskan Seafoods, had been scheduled to
depart Jan. 5 for Alaska.

   There's an art to whining properly, says the
founder of National Whiners Day.
   Kevin Zaborney urged people to set Monday aside for a ``whine and
cheese party'' or go to a department store and whine around the
lines of people returning Christmas gifts.
   The 24-year-old Monroe man said he got the idea for Whiners Day,
and selected the day after Christmas, because of his retail
experiences.
   ``A very high-pitched, childlike tone of voice is what makes it
special,'' he said.
   But those who celebrate the day are likely to do it alone,
according to University of Michigan psychologist Christopher
Peterson.
   ``There have been studies showing that people who are glooomy and
pessimistic turn off other people and don't have as many satisfying
relationships,'' he said. ``Ultimately, the way we act comes home to
roost on us.''
   Zaborney doesn't plan a big to-do, although he did name his 1988
co-whiners of the year, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart and former PTL
Club co-host Tammy Faye Bakker.

   Police searched today for a group of
attackers who hurled firebombs at a U.S. military base in the
southern city of Taegu, starting a small fire.
   Police officials, who declined to be named, said the attackers
yelled anti-American slogans on Monday and hurled five firebombs
that started a fire on the roof of a building at Camp Henry and an
adjoining grassy area.
   The fire was quickly extinguished and there were no injuries,
police said. They said the attackers fled.
   A U.S. military spokesman in Seoul confirmed the incident in the
city 180 miles south of Seoul and said it was ``very minor.''
   The attackers, who appeared to be radical students, put up
several wall posters saying, ``Drive out U.S. imperialists and
secure complete independence of our nation,'' police said.
   Radical students have staged a series of attacks on U.S. military
bases in South Korea in recent months. The radicals claim U.S.
forces help perpetuate the division of the Korean peninsula.
   About 42,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under a mutual
defense treaty against communist North Korea. American troops have
been based in the south since 1950.

<HEAD>A `Pretty Typical' Death Stands Out</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd and 3rd grafs with two grafs to UPDATE with police
saying they are not sure that Rosa's death set the record</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His name was Carlos Rosa, he was 19 years old and
he died violently. The suspect and motive behind his killing are a
mystery, but drugs are believed to have played a role.
   Those are the bare facts behind what was, in every sense, a
typical killing in New York City in 1988. Carlos Rosa's death on
Christmas Eve stands out for only one reason: It may have broken the
record for the number of New York City homicides in a single year.
   Rosa, who was shot to death near his home on Staten Island late
Saturday, was the 1,842nd homicide victim of the year, according to
Sgt. Diane Kubler, a police spokeswoman. By some counts, the 1981
record was 1,841 killings, although police said later that 1,826
homicides took place that year, indicating the record could have
been broken earlier.
   On Christmas Day, seven more people were killed. About 30 more
homicides are expected by New Year's.
   No American city comes close to New York in volume of violent
deaths. The city averages five homicides a day; its closest
competitor, Los Angeles, averages fewer than three.
   Other cities do have much higher homicide rates. New York ranks
10th among major American cities in number of homicides per 100,000
people; the most murderous city in the country is Detroit.
   New York reached its 1981 peak in violence during a period of
fiscal retrenchment in which the number of police officers had
declined. Throughout the early '80s, as the city rebuilt the Police
Department and national crime rates fell, the number of homicides
each year declined.
   But the numbers have been increasing for several years, and
criminal justice experts are virtually unanimous about the cause:
crack cocaine.
   ``It's not surprising,'' said Robert Trojanowicz, director of the
School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University. ``The turf
wars over the drug business are generally what's causing the
increase. Drugs are the major growth business these days.''
   Not only are there more drug dealers, Trojanowicz said, but the
dealers are becoming more violent. One reason is that American
culture is becoming more violent; another is that the supply of
drugs has outstripped the demand, so drug sellers are fighting for
customers.
   ``The bottom line, from their standpoint, is that they want to
eliminate competition,'' Trojanowicz said. ``The main method is to
eliminate the competitor.''
   It's not clear what happened to Rosa, nor is much known about his
background. Neighbors told newspapers he was a drug dealer; police
have declined to comment on that, but say the killing appears to
have been drug-related.
   Rosa lived on Staten Island, not far from where the Staten Island
Ferry docks. Police found his body in the middle of a nearby
intersection and pronounced him dead at the scene. His head and
upper torso were riddled with bullet wounds.
   ``It's pretty typical,'' said Sgt. Kenneth Backes, a detective
assigned to Staten Island, the least populated and most peaceful of
New York City's five boroughs. ``This is our 30th one for the year,
and we run the gamut here.''

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index rose to a
record high Tuesday, while the dollar rose marginally against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
181.65 points Monday, added another 182.92 points, or 0.61 percent,
and closed at 30,050.93. The index also had closed above 30,000 on
Dec. 7, ending at 30,050.82, but fell back below 30,000 on
profit-taking the next day.
   The dollar closed unchanged from its opening at 124.80 yen, up
0.08 yen from Monday's close of 124.72 yen. The currency moved in a
tight range between 124.68 and 124.83 yen.
   Investors lacked fresh incentives.
   ``The dollar-yen rate was barely moving, because investors cannot
determine which direction they should move,'' said Masaharu Takenaka
a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo.
   Because overseas markets were closed for the Christmas holiday
Monday, the Tokyo market was unaffected by overseas market trends,
Takenaka said.
   Individual investors' buy orders helped push stock prices higher,
but trading was sluggish as speculative investors moved to the
sidelines ahead of a six-day new year holiday, said a broker with a
major securities firm.
   Tuesday was last full day of trading this year. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange will close after a half-day session Wednesday until it
reopens for another half-day session Jan. 4.

<TEXT>
   City police are trying to find why two
undercover officers left a hotel before they investigated a man
suspected of drug involvement who was meeting at the time with Mayor
Marion Barry, according to a published report.
   Barry has acknowledged meeting the man, former city employee
Charles Lewis, three times last week at a hotel where a hotel maid
complained that Lewis offered her cocaine.
   In an investigation that has since turned into a probe of how
police handled a case touching on the mayor, two undercover officers
were reportedly called back from their attempt to buy drugs at the
time Barry was in the room with Lewis, according to The Washington
Post.
   The Post also reported the city police official in charge of the
original case offered to lie to reporters about the Lewis
investigation, a charge the official denied.
   ``That statement is emphatically a lie,'' Deputy Chief Edward J.
Spurlock, said on WUSA-TV Monday. ``I would not lie in reference to
the performance of my duty.''
   The Washington Post reported Monday that Barry was in a city
hotel room with Lewis on Thursday when two detectives were called
back from an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from Lewis.
   The Post, quoting unidentified city government sources, said the
detectives were on their way to the room but left after ``somebody
called them back downstairs.''
   The Post reported in today's editions that the two detectives
gave conflicted accounts of the incident at the hotel, but said no
details were available on how the accounts differed.
   Lewis, a Virgin Islands resident, has denied any involvement with
drugs.
   Traces of cocaine were found in the hotel room after Lewis
checked out last Friday, although the tests did not indicate whether
the cocaine had been in the room recently.
   District of Columbia police are now investigating whether Lewis
was involved with drugs, how police handled the complaint and why
the mayor was at the hotel.
   Barry has telephoned police officials involved in the internal
investigation several times, even though he is expected to be
questioned, the Post reported, quoting sources.
   A mayoral spokesman has denied Barry was trying to influence the
investigation and said the calls were made only to find out when it
would be completed. He quoted Barry as saying, ``I want them to
finish this investigation and get to the bottom of this as soon as
possible.''

<HEAD>Nation's First Plant To Recycle Plastic Coffee Cups Starts Up Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LEOMINSTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first plant to turn plastic
items like foam coffee cups and hamburger trays into things like
flowerpots, coat hangers and even fence posts opens next month.
   And its creators expect the $4 million plant to change the
reputation of the maligned material.
   ``I predict that the plastic bashing that's going on today will
stop and polystyrene will become an environmental hero,'' said
Robert J. Barrett, safety environmental officer at Mobil Chemical
Co. of Rochester, N.Y., one of two backers of the factory.
   The plant, called Plastics Again, is a converted warehouse with
machines that can turn 3 million pounds of dirty cups, trays and
cutlery _ the amount that 1,000 schools throw away yearly _ into
hard, pea-size pellets.
   Mobil and Genpak Corp. of Glens Falls, N.Y., hope to use the
pellets themselves and sell them to other companies for making wall
insulation, fence posts, flowerpots and packing material, or
anything not dealing with food because of the danger of
contamination. They expect a profit by 1992.
   Barrett sees a lucrative market because the nation uses 5 billion
pounds of polystyrene yearly. He said Mobil has five people
searching for cheap sources of used or low-grade plastic film for
recycling.
   One key to the plant's survival, however, is teaching diners to
stack their used cups and trays in a special garbage can so the
waste can be collected easily and carted to the 21,000-square-foot
plant in this industrial town 40 miles west of Boston.
   To that end, the company has spent three months carrying out
lunchroom experiments at schools in Lexington and Glastonbury, Conn.
The company has agreed to take their polystyrene waste for free if
the schools use the special garbage cans.
   ``Kids will be kids. Some are throwing plates in the wrong place
as an act of rebellion,'' said Brad Devlin, Glastonbury schools'
director of food services. ``But I'm willing to bet a week's pay
that it's been 90 percent effective.''
   The project has worked so well at one school in Lexington that a
principal at another complained about being left out of the
experiment, said James MacInnes, assistant superintendent.
   The reason for its success, the two said, is that children are
worried about diminishing landfill space for garbage including
polystyrene, which accounts for half the waste in school cafeterias.
   MacInnes said 300 teen-agers signed petitions last spring
demanding that Lexington schools switch from polystyrene to paper,
although plastic is cheaper, keeps food warm longer and doesn't get
soggy.
   The plant is the result of these and many other protests against
the material that has become the rallying point of
environmentalists. Supporters claim that polystyrene accounts for
only 10 percent of all the plastics produced in the world, takes up
only one-quarter of 1 percent of the nation's landfill space and
takes just as long as paper to biodegrade.
   The polystyrene industry even volunteered to stop using
chlorofluorocarbons in plastic manufacture by the end of 1988
because it threatens the Earth's ozone layer.
   Nevertheless, Berkeley, Calif., and Suffolk County, N.Y., have
banned polystyrene. Even Gov. Michael Dukakis, in the state where
the recycling plant is being built, has banned state agencies from
buying plastic-foam food packaging beginning in July.
   ``The Styrofoam industry has come to realize that if they want
the public to buy the stuff, they've got to do something about
throwing it away,'' MacInnes said.
   Genpak and Mobil already had in their plants machinery to crumble
pieces of polystyrene left over from making plastic trays and other
products and to smooth them out into sheets ready for manufacturing
again.
   The challenge was inventing a way to wash the used plastic as it
was being crumbled by the machines and to find a way to get the
plastic ware from schools and other institutions to the plant.
   Researchers from the two companies came up with a string of
machines that crumble, wash, dry and remove the air from the plastic
particles and turn them into pellets.
   Massachusetts was chosen because of CRInc., a Billerica-based
fleet of trucks started by the liquor industry a few years ago to
pick up aluminum cans from around the state for recycling under the
bottle bill.
   Plastics Again plant manager Tom Tomazck said the 20 schools and
two Wang Co. cafeterias that will be the factory's main sources of
polystyrene in its first year are on CRInc. truck routes.
   In time, he said, the factory may branch out to prisons and other
institutions and is talking to a fast-food chain he declined to name.

<HEAD>Hostage: Police Commandos Killed Inmate Who Surrendered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEPIC, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a special police commando squad
that quelled a prison uprising killed at least one inmate after he
had surrendered, according to a hostage rescued by the team.
   At least five inmates may have been killed after surrendering.
   Freed hostage Patricia Castillo said Monday that the commandos
entered the Venustiano Carranza state penitentiary on Friday
``shooting indiscriminately.
   ``The squad was very angry because they (the inmates) had killed
their commander. I was very scared. ... There was quite a bit of
shooting. They killed all the inmates there, except one.''
   Of the four inmates in the room where Castillo spent 32 hours as
a hostage, only Jose Martinez Palafox was captured alive, she said.
   Martinez' name is on the list of 25 people who died in the
uprising in Tepic, 500 miles northwest of Mexico City. Castillo said
Martinez had surrendered: ``He was not wounded. But they killed him
anyway.''
   A clerk in the prison law office, Castillo was among about 19
hostages seized Thursday by a group of inmates to protest the denial
of Christmas pardons for good behavior.
   Officials at first said the inmates died during two assaults
Friday night. But according to a witness, two hostages and a
videotape made by NBC News, only one assault occurred and many
mutinous prisoners were still alive afterward.
   Five of 13 inmates on the NBC videotape identified themselves to
officers with names that appeared on the official list of prisoners
who died in the assault. Those five did not include Martinez Palafox.
   Brenda Margarita Rubio, a prison records clerk held hostage, also
said the inmates surrendered.
   Only one prisoner was in the room with her and about a dozen
other hostages and that prisoner walked out with his hands raised,
she said.
   Castillo criticized the governor for calling in the special
police squads.
   On Monday, Gov. Celso Humberto Delgado Ramirez was quoted in a
Tepic newspaper as saying legal sanctions would be taken against
those repsonsible for any unwarranted killings.
   Efforts to reach Delgado, who reportedly met with federal
officials in Mexico City on Monday, were unsuccessful.
   Rodolfo Leon, the state attorney general, also promised to
investigate the case carefully, including reports inmates who were
captured during the commando team assault were killed while in
custody.
   Earlier Monday, state authorities had denied any knowledge of how
five inmates died after they were videotaped while in police custody.
   ``We are prepared to clear it all up,'' Leon told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview. ``Right now it is very complicated.
Nothing has been confirmed yet.''
   Some prisoners' bodies had up to 10 bullet wounds, the government
news agency Notimex said.
   Among those who died before the assault were the prison warden,
Samuel Alvarado, and Jorge Armando Duarte Badillo, the Fox squad
commander, who officials said was killed while trying to negotiate
with the inmates.
   One witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
prisoners captured after the assault were questioned in a park
outside the prison, then taken back inside. Members of the Fox team
also entered the prison, and more than 30 gunshots were heard after
that.
   The death toll was given Friday night as six, but on Saturday
jumped to 22, then 24. A state government spokesman said Monday that
the confirmed toll was 25.

<TEXT>
   Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Tom William Scott,
the father of Gemini and Apollo astronaut David Randolph Scott, has
died at age 86.
   Scott, who began his 28-year military career in 1929 as a U.S.
Army flying cadet, died of natural causes Thursday at his La Jolla
home.
   During World War II, Scott was a base commander at Burtonwood Air
Depot in England, the main U.S. maintenance depot for aircraft being
used in Europe. He also served as deputy commander of the 20th Air
Force during the Korean conflict, overseeing the United States'
long-range bombing of Communist forces in Korea.
   Scott, whose military honors included the Bronze Star and two
Legions of Merit, retired in February 1957, and moved to La Jolla
four years later.
   Scott was a La Jolla Town Council trustee from 1966 to 1972.
   His son David became an astronaut in 1963 and flew on the Gemini
8 and Apollo 9 space missions before being named commander of Apollo
15. David Scott is now president of a Palmdale company that provides
engineering and marketing services for commercial space projects.
   Scott is survived by his wife, Marian; sons David of Manhattan
Beach and Tom Jr. of Birmingham, Ala.
   A memorial service is scheduled for Friday at St. James
By-the-Sea Episcopal Church.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index rose to a
record high today, while the dollar edged up marginally against the
Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 181.65-point gainer on
Monday, climbed another 182.92 points, or 0.61 percent, closing this
year's last full-day session at 30,050.93.
   It was the second time for the Nikkei to close above 30,000. It
closed at 30,050.82 on Dec. 7, then fell back the next day on
profit-taking.
   Despite the rise in the index, trading was directionless, said a
dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   ``Investors just didn't know what to buy, although they are
expecting that prices would go up further,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Interest floated from one issue to another in the absence of
influence from overseas markets, which were closed for the Christmas
holidays, the dealer said.
   In addition, he said, with the Tokyo market due to close for a
six-day New Year holiday after a half-day session Wednesday,
uncertainties over the ailing Emperor Hirohito's condition led to
caution about large stock holdings.
   A further market closing would be expected in case of the death
of the 87-year-old emperor, now bedridden for 100 days with internal
bleeding.
   Speculative investors were buying issues in spot trades and
selling in the futures market to collect profits on the settlement,
which also helped the Nikkei's rise, other dealers said.
   Trading was not very active, with volume traded on the first
section estimated at 700 million shares.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed unchanged from
the opening rate of 124.80 yen, up 0.08 yen from Monday's close of
124.72 yen. The currency moved in a narrow range between 124.68 and
124.83 yen.
   Because overseas markets were closed for a Monday, most market
participants stayed on the sidelines to await indications of how
rates were moving, said Masaharu Takenaka of the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The dollar-yen rate was barely moving, because investors cannot
determine which direction they should move,'' he said.
   Other dealers said most traders on the Tokyo market appeared to
have started year-end holidays already.

   Marla Ponitz received a gift unequaled
by any under the tree when a man came to her home and returned a
diamond ring he had stolen from her kitchen two months ago.
   Mrs. Ponitz just finished serving Christmas dinner to 21
relatives Sunday when the doorbell rang.
   ``My husband answered the door and the man said, `I worked here
two months ago. Is your wife at home?''' Mrs. Ponitz said. ``I went
and he said, `I was sweeping the floor and I took the ring.' And he
had tears in his eyes and I started to cry.''
   The man was one of eight Mrs. Ponitz and her husband, Kenneth,
employed to remodel their kitchen.
   ``He said, `I don't need the money. I don't know why I took it.'
And then he pulled it out of his pocket.''
   Mrs. Ponitz took the ring and told the man she didn't want to
know his name.
   ``I just got hysterical because I never thought I'd see it
again,'' Mrs. Ponitz said.
   Her husband gave her the ring to celebrate the birth of their
second child. The ring, a 1{-karat diamond surrounded by 18 little
diamonds, was worth $3,400 when it was purchased three years ago. It
was not insured.
   Mrs. Ponitz said she wasn't going to press charges and hopes the
floor company doesn't fire the man.
   ``It took a lot of guts for him to come over here and confront
me. He could have mailed it or not brought it back. But he came here
not knowing what he was going to face. He must have been prepared
for anything.''

<HEAD>Trial Over, But Bitterness Remains, Civil Rights Leaders Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The fight over the city's treatment of blacks
will continue despite an agreement that stopped the trial of 13
civil rights activists who tried to halt a City Council meeting,
black leaders said.
   Several civil rights leaders said they now have some misgivings
about last week's agreement. They said they may have given up a
public forum that could have generated national attention about
Toledo's racial problems, and fear that the city will never
negotiate in good faith.
   ``I certainly regret having not held out. That was a mistake,''
said the Rev. Floyd Rose, a defendant and a leader of a group of
black ministers called the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance.
   The 13 activists were arrested June 28 and charged with
obstructing official business. A judge dismissed the case Wednesday
after they pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of failure to
disperse.
   Since then, Rose and other alliance members have met with City
Manager Philip Hawkey and Mayor Donna Owens.
   The city appears unwilling to negotiate on many of the issues
that led to the arrests, including giving severance pay to Bernard
Culp, the Community Development Department's former commissioner of
renewal operations, Rose said. Racial tensions flared after the city
fired Culp, who is black, and suspended two others. The civil rights
leaders asked for a hearing into allegations that he mishandled the
city's housing programs, but the request was denied.
   The management shuffle in the department followed an
investigation by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development that said the city's housing rehabilitation program was
deficient. The city was billed for home repairs that were never made.
   ``They (other defendants) believed that by entering the
no-contest plea to the lesser charge and agreeing to the conditions,
the city would at least make some concessions in kind. Of course,
the city has done nothing. We just should not have done it,'' Rose
said.
   Rose said the ministerial alliance will move ahead with calls for
improvements to be made in black neighborhoods.
   Civil rights leaders said the city needs to become more sensitive
to the needs of minorities and that more blacks must be hired and
promoted in city government.
   Blacks comprise about 17 percent of Toledo's 340,000 population
and 22 percent of the city work force.
   The city on Dec. 12 announced a new affirmative action plan,
which civil rights leaders called a step forward. But the plan has
not been adopted by City Council.
   Still, LeRoy Williams, president of the Toledo chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he
is optimistic the city will be more attentive to their complaints.
   ``In spite of what anybody says on both sides, there have been
some subtle negotiations or talks going on for the last couple of
months. I think that will probably have to be intensified,'' he said.
   He said the issues that led to the City Council takeover will not
fade.
   ``At this point, it would behoove the city to make geniune
progress to avoid other acts of civil disobedience because they will
become better organized,'' Williams said.
   The mayor said the city wants to end the dispute but that she
will not yield to threats of civil disobedience.
   ``I have been in meetings with members of the black community. We
have been identifying issues that are of concern to them,'' she
said. ``We want to continue to work together on those issues. We've
been doing this in a very good atmosphere.
   ``I will not be in an atmosphere where it's going to be
combative. I don't believe in dealing with issues by threats, and I
don't intend to be threatened.''

   Wilbur Reneau was tired of selling
office equipment and was having breakfast at a hotel overlooking the
Caribbean Sea when fate touched his tongue in the form of a
mixed-fruit jam.
   ``I had never tasted anything like that before,'' he said
recently, recalling the trip to his native Belize. ``So I
immediately called the chamber of commerce to find out who made it.''
   That inquiry led him to the Melinda family, who had been trying
without success to break into the United States' market.
   That meeting led to the birth of Reneau Imports Inc., which is
based in this Chicago suburb and is betting its future that
Americans are willing to buy exotic jams.
   ``These are fruits Asians, Hispanics, Jamaicans grew up eating,''
said Reneau, 30. ``The flavors will also appeal to others because
people travel more and they expect something different.''
   Reneau's Melinda brand of banana, mixed fruit, tropical fruit,
guava, papaya, mango and pineapple jams _ and a carrot-based hot
sauce also produced by the Melinda family _ are scheduled to hit the
shelves of two grocery chains in the Midwest next month.
   ``They are wild,'' said Martin McDevitt Jr., a Milwaukee-based
analyst who tracks the jam industry.

   But after 70 years of marriage, Mildred and Marion Blair agree on
one thing _ matrimony is terrific.
   The Blairs celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary Christmas
Day here at a gathering of four generations of the Blair family.
   The couple were married on Christmas Day in 1918 after Blair
arrived in Fort Scott, Kan., on a furlough from the Army. They
settled in Fort Scott, operated a dairy farm for 36 years, then
followed their children to Denver.
   Marion Blair, 93, attributed his long life and lengthy marriage
to ``living on a farm and good food.''
   But he and his 89-year-old wife still have their disagreements,
including the circumstances of their first meeting.
   Blair said it was sometime in 1916, on a road near Fort Scott.
``Her car wouldn't start,'' he said. ``I made the mistake of
cranking it for her.''
   But Mrs. Blair said, ``He and I had been in a play together and
he had gone outside.'' Then, she said, he approached an auctioneer
about purchasing a box supper she had made.

<TEXT>
   A cattle rancher's son has
confessed to arranging last week's murder of an ecologist and labor
leader known worldwide for his efforts to preserve the Amazon rain
forest, police say.
   Police said Darcy Pereira, 21, told them he hired a professional
killer to slay Francisco Mendes, who was shot Thursday as he stepped
from his house in the jungle city of Rio Branco, 2,650 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   The local police official who was reached by telephone and
provided The Associated Press with the information identified
himself only as officer Calbi and would not offer further details.
   TV Globo, the nation's principal private network, said Pereira's
father was involved in a land dispute with Mendes, 44, who was known
internationally for leading a campaign against destruction of the
Amazon region.
   In June 1987, Mendes was honored by the United Nations for his
fight as head of the local rubber tappers' union to stop acres of
rain forest from being cleared for cattle grazing.
   Pereira turned himself in to the 4th Police Precinct in Rio
Branco accompanied by a lawyer, according to TV Globo. It identified
Pereira as the son of cattle rancher Darli Alves da Silva, who TV
Globo reported was involved in a land dispute with Mendes.
   Under Brazilian custom, the son does not always use his father's
name.
   Mendes said in recent news interviews that he received death
threats from Alves da Silva. Police had assigned two guards to
protect Mendes.
   Land disputes have killed about 250 people a year in Brazil since
1985. Landless peasant farmers, ecologists and progressives in the
Roman Catholic Church have suffered most in battles with large land
owners, many of whom employ private armies to protect their
properties.

   The station's Top 40 request line is one digit from Burton's home

hear ``Yesterday.'' Burton told her she had the wrong number, but
she didn't believe him. She insisted he play the Beatles' song.
   So, Burton, 32, sang it for her.
   The number of wrong calls have trailed off to just a couple a

<HEAD>Pinochet Government Agrees To Formal Meeting With Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in 15 years of
authoritarian rule, President Augusto Pinochet's government has
agreed to hold formal talks with opposition leaders.
   The government agreed Monday to meet the opposition on Jan. 3 to
discuss demands for constitutional changes that would speed up a
transition to democracy.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian Democratic
Party and spokesman for a 17-party opposition coalition, requested
the meeting.
   The opposition stepped up demands for constitutional changes
after its stunning victory Oct. 5 in a referendum in which Gen.
Pinochet sought to extend his hold on power until 1997.
   The 73-year-old president and army commander has ruled since a
bloody 1973 military coup ousted elected President Salvador Allende,
a Marxist.
   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres vetoed participation in the
January meeting by Luis Maira, whose newly founded Wide Front of the
Socialist Left Party includes members of the outlawed Communist
Party.
   The opposition did not immediately say if it would accept the
veto, but it will ``probably'' go ahead with the meeting without
Maira, sources said.
   Pinochet's loss in the Oct. 5 referendum forced him to call open
elections for president and congress, now scheduled for Dec. 14,
1989.
   Government foes say constitutional changes are needed before the
election, so the next government can effectively lead Chile to
democracy.
   The opposition wants to reduce the quorum required to amend the
constitution, to drop an article outlawing Marxist parties, and to
change the make-up of a powerful National Security Council now
dominated by the military.
   Dissidents also want to eliminate an article that makes one-third
of the future 35-member Senate appointed instead of elected.
   The government initially balked at constitutional changes, but
high-ranking officials recently have conceded the possibility of
``improving'' the military-inspired constitution.
   Caceres, a civilian, said that in agreeing to meet the
opposition, the government is prepared to ``listen and debate
different points of view that are expressed respectfully and within
the legal framework.''
   Caceres was appointed interior minister in a Cabinet shuffle
ordered by Pinochet after his referendum defeat.

   Two men who were buried alive in an
avalanche for nearly seven hours say they survived because they
stayed calm and managed to pound air pockets in the 6-foot-deep snow.
   Brett Woods, 24, and Keith Cathcart, 19, were dug out Sunday
morning after passersby heard their screams and spotted Woods' blue
glove sticking out of the snow.
   The two Durango men said they were caught in the slide while
climbing a hill on the outskirts of their home town to see what it
looked like on Christmas all covered with snow.
   They were listed in satisfactory condition today at Mercy Medical
Center, recovering from hypothermia and muscle injuries.
   ``I panicked massively for a minute,'' Woods said from his
hospital bed. ``I thought I was going to suffocate.''
   But he said he managed to calm down and begin digging for air.
   ``I kept thinking I didn't want to suffocate on Christmas. I
don't know what kept me going. I guess that I want to go skiing,''
he said.
   ``I stuck my glove out of the snow. Just the fingertips. I was
pretty much trying to get some air, but then after I got some air
and I got to thinking clearly, I thought someone would see it.''
   Cathcart said he remembered Boy Scout training and pounded an air
pocket in the snow with his head and fists. He said he and Woods
were lucky they landed in sitting positions.
   Woods said he heard traffic on the road just 15 feet away. After
many hours, he heard footsteps and shouted for help.
   Nine hours is the longest anyone has survived being buried in an
avalanche in the this country, said Andy Loving of the Avalanche
Information Center in Denver. Someone in Canada survived 22 hours,
he said.
   Woods and Cathcart, who both work at a pizza restaurant,
apparently set off the slide as they walked near the top of the
Chapman Hill ski area Sunday afternoon. They rode the slide down,
but a second avalanche buried them at the bottom of the hill before
they could get up.
   Cathcart's temperature dropped to 87 degrees, and Woods' to 91,
hospital officials said.
   Nearly 3 feet of snow fell in southwestern Colorado by Sunday,
and the avalanche hazard was reported to be extreme. Both men said
they were unaware of the warnings.
   The Avalanche Information Center reported more than 100 slides in
Colorado's high country.

   At least 357 people died on the nation's highways
Christmas weekend, slightly less than during a normal non-holiday
weekend this time of year, according to police reports and the
National Safety Council.
   The highest number of deaths were reported in Florida with 40,
California with 38, and Texas with 33.
   The Chicago-based National Safety Council had estimated there
would be between 350 and 450 traffic deaths during Christmas
weekend, which for counting purposes ran from 6 p.m. Friday until
midnight Monday local time.
   Last year, 389 people were killed in traffic accidents during the
period, according to the council.
   During a normal Friday night through Monday non-holiday period in
December an estimated 380 people die in crashes, said Barbara
Carraro, a council statistician.
   The council said its projection for traffic deaths for New Year's
weekend also was 350 to 450.

   Randy Jackson, younger brother of pop
superstar Michael Jackson, was arrested for investigation of a
traffic violation, and the 1987 Rolls-Royce Corniche he was driving
was impounded, police said.
   Jackson, 27, was taken into custody after police pulled him over
and discovered he wasn't carrying his driver's license, Sgt. John
Zrofsky said Tuesday.
   The singer-drummer, who accompanied his five brothers on the
Jacksons' 1984 Victory tour, was stopped after he failed to yield to
a pedestrian in Hollywood, Zrofsky said. Jackson was given a traffic
citation for that, and officers discovered he was sought on a
warrant issued for failing to appear in court on a misdemeanor
traffic offense, the sergeant said.
   The youngest Jackson brother was booked at the Hollywood station
for driving without his license and in connection with the warrant,
Zrofsky said. He was released after posting bail of $262.
   Police impounded the Rolls-Royce, which was registered to a
leasing company, the sergeant said. Under California law, vehicles
may be impounded if the driver isn't carrying a license.

<HEAD>Snow, Freezing Rain in Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow, freezing rain, or a mix of the two hit the Midwest
today, leaving up to a foot of snow and making roads treacherous,
while the next storm churned off the Pacific Coast.
   Snow fell in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Indiana, and
freezing rain in Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan and Ohio.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect for northern Minnesota and
for eastern North Dakota, where 20 to 35 mph winds were expected to
make wind chills a dangerous 50 degrees below zero.
   The storm Monday dumped up to 12 inches of snow on Chicago and on
Thief River Falls and Bemidji, Minn., and was expected to leave as
much as 14 inches in northwest Minnesota.
   Three to 5 inches of snow covered southern Wisconsin before
changing to rain as warmer air moved in Monday evening. Indiana got
up to 7 inches.
   The freezing rain left a layer of ice on top of 1 to 3 inches of
snow that fell Monday, making roads slick and dangerous.
   In the lower Missouri Valley, showers and thunderstorms brought
winds gusting to 45 mph and brief heavy rain. By early today, the
thunderstorms extended southwest into northwest Texas.
   The next big storm was off the northern Pacific Coast. A freezing
rain advisory was in effect for the western Columbia Gorge in
Oregon, and an advisory for 6 or more inches of snow was posted for
the state's Cascade Mountains.
   In Nevada, temperatures dropped to minus 17 degrees late Monday,
breaking the 1962 record for the date of 12 below. Freeze warnings
were up today in the California valleys, where temperatures were
expected to drop into the 20s.
   By contrast, a high-temperature record was set Monday in Kansas
City, Mo., where it was 60 degrees, 10 degrees higher than the 1979
mark. The 75 degrees in Wichita Falls tied the mark set in 1942.
   The nation's high was 85 degrees in Beeville, Texas, where
President-elect Bush flew Monday for a quail-hunting vacation.
Cotulla, Kingsville and Laredo, Texas, also had 85-degree readings.
   Today's forecast called for snow, with rain at lower elevations,
from the northern Rockies to the northern Pacific Coast; snow from
the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles to sections of Oklahoma, Kansas,
Missouri, Iowa, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and
from New York state to the central New England coast. Snow was
expected to change to freezing rain over parts of Oklahoma, South
Dakota and Wisconsin; rain and occasional thunderstorms was expected
from the eastern three-quarters of Texas to the lower Mississippi
Valley, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and much of inland New York.
   High temperatures were forecast in the single digits in eastern
Montana and North Dakota; the teens and 20s in the Rockies, the rest
of the northern Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley, Upper
Michigan, northeast New York and northern New England; the 30s and
40s in central New England, Maryland, Delaware, the rest of the
Great Lakes, the central Mississippi Valley, the eastern two-thirds
of Kansas, western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, southern sections
of New Mexico and Arizona, and the northern two-thirds of the
Pacific Coast; the 70s and 80s in Florida, the lower Mississippi
Valley and the Texas coast; and in the 50s and 60s in the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 20
degrees below zero at Butte, Mont., to 74 degrees at Homestead, Fla.

   Alive but not quite kicking, ``Legs Diamond''
finally opened Monday on Broadway, and the results are a mixed bag
of musical tricks.
   The much anticipated and already much maligned Peter Allen
musical is not the disaster some had feared. But the show, which
premiered at the Mark Hellinger Theater after nearly two months of
preview performances, is not exactly memorable either.
   One trouble with ``Legs'' is its star, Peter Allen, who also
wrote the music and lyrics for this $5 million extravaganza about
the famous New York gangster. Allen is a galvanizing performer, an
OK dancer and a croaky but appealing singer. But he's not an actor,
and you need someone with a sense of character to inject life and,
more important, believability into the spineless book by Harvey
Fierstein and Charles Suppon.
   That's another of the show's missteps _ the skimpiest story this
side of ``Starlight Express.'' Fierstein and Suppon reportedly have
pared the book to a fraction of what it once was. They must have
taken out all the jokes, because the laughs are pretty meager.
That's a deadly prospect for a show which insistently trumpets
itself as ``a big new Broadway musical.''
   Entertain is what ``Legs Diamond'' most desperately wants to do.
Sometimes it actually does.
   From the moment the curtain rises, you know you are looking at a
frivolous and expensive show. There's Allen, strutting on a catwalk
high above the stage, singing about ``When I Get My Name in Lights''
while what looks like every light bulb in Times Square flash the
show's subtitle _ ``The Almost Totally Fictitious Musical Hystery of
Legs Diamond.''
   The number pretty much tells the story of the show. This mobster
is not a killer, but a song-and-dance man, and he'd rather star in
his own nightclub act than take over the city's bootleg operations.
He eventually succeeds, but his climb to show biz success seems
predictable from the start.
   Still, ``Legs Diamond'' does a lot to camouflage this lack of
suspense. For one thing, it never stops moving. It's almost as if
director Robert Allan Ackerman and choreographer Alan Johnson were
afraid to have the musical slow down. If it did, it might not be
able to start up again.
   Johnson has devised several frantic, lavish and time-killing
dances for a line of chorus cuties. The numbers recall ``The Carol
Burnett Show'' on an off-night.
   Still, the dances give costume designer Willa Kim a chance to go
wild. Somehow she manages to put the girls in reindeer antlers and
even kewpie doll hats. For the show's more than 300 costumes, Kim
seems to have cornered the market on all the sequins, feathers,
spangles and even bananas in New York.
   Set designer David Mitchell also makes sure the momentum never
flags. His gargantuan settings include two different and lavish
nightclubs, Pennsylvania Station, a long prison cell block and a
boulevard of skyscrapers that hug the top of the Hellinger's ornate
ceiling.
   Allen's score, particularly the ballads, exerts a lot of charm.
It successfully bridges pop and musical comedy, something rare among
the current crop of Broadway's musicals. Several of the songs would
seem to be able to have a life outside the show, particularly
Allen's finale, ``All I Wanted Was the Dream.'' The show should make
a fine original cast recording.
   The story also includes several unconvincing love affairs for
Diamond. His love life includes an archetypal dumb blonde named
Kiki, played in fine squeaky-voiced style by Randall Edwards and
Flo, a tough-talking older woman, played by the terrific Julie
Wilson.
   Miss Wilson, a musical comedy veteran, wrings some honest emotion
from a torch song called ``The Music Went Out of My Life,'' the
closest thing the musical has to a showstopper.
   There is one stunning production number, called ``Only Steal From
Thieves,'' in which Diamond muscles in on the territory of his chief
rival, Arnold Rothstein, played by Joe Silver. In it, the battle
between the gangs is waged behind a giant scrim and the hijacking of
a train, ship and truck is seen in silhouette.
   The other male performers have a hard time of it in ``Legs
Diamond'' and are given little opportunity to shine. The gangsters
in such musicals as ``Guys and Dolls'' and ``Do Re Mi'' were funny,
brash, even rakish characters. Here, they are nearly anonymous
buffoons, despite the game try by such excellent character actors as
Silver, Raymond Serra, Christian Kauffmann and Jim Fyfe.
   Still, the success of this show rests on the success of the
performer who plays its title character, not the supporting players.
And Peter Allen doesn't quite deliver.
   ``Legs Diamond'' is a musical in search of a leading man.
   In other reviews:
   ``The creators of `Legs Diamond' could not even come up with the
riotous larger-than-life fiasco of which theatrical legends are
made,'' wrote Frank Rich in The New York Times. ``The script, so
confusing I lost its thread before the end of the first number, is a
series of song cues that never crystallizes into a story. ... As for
Mr. Allen's songs, they are so derivative they make Andrew Lloyd
Webber's scores sound idiosyncratic.''
   Howard Kissel wrote in the Daily News: ``Allen's score seldom
goes beyond the pleasant, though it has been attractively
orchestrated and there are several engaging choral numbers. ... His
talent is supperclub size _ likeable, soft, intimate. Neither as a
songwriter nor as a performer can he fill a Broadway stage. As a
gangster, even a singing and dancing gangster, he is hopeless.''
   ``Most of the music appears to take unmemorability to the point
of clinical amnesia, and you go out humming a headache,'' wrote
Clive Barnes in the New York Post. ``The lyrics have little
originality or fancy, while the book ... seems to take the sobriquet
`Legs' so literally that the show's narrative becomes a pedestrian
walkway.''

<HEAD>Takeshita Forms New Cabinet, Committee On Ethics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita today formed a new
Cabinet and established a party committee on ethics in an effort to
restore public confidence in a government embarrassed by a
stock-trading scandal.
   ``He is determined to restore public confidence by aggressively
dealing with the matter of political ethics,'' Chief Cabinet
Secretary Keizo Obuchi said in a nationally televised news
conference.
   But one political analyst said the new Cabinet must face the
problem ``that Takeshita himself was linked to the scandal.''
   The 20-member Cabinet contains 15 new names, but key officials
such as Obuchi, Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno and Finance Minister
Tatsuo Murayama retained their posts.
   Takeshita's popularity has been eroded by the passage of a
controversial tax reform program and by the scandal, in which
influential politicians profited from transactions in unlisted
shares in a real estate firm.
   Earlier this month, a poll in the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun
showed the Takeshita government's approval rating had slumped to 18
percent from 30 percent when he took office in November 1987.
Takeshita had an aide who profited in share transactions, but the
prime minister denied any personal involvement.
   ``I am aware that the public is losing confidence in politicians,
business leaders and public officials,'' said new Justice Minister
Takashi Hasegawa, who heads a parliamentary ethics committee and was
expected to lead governmental corruption investigations.
   ``It is a serious matter to rectify it. For Japan to be trusted
in the international arena, we have to start with establishing a
trustworthy political system.''
   Political analyst Masaya Ito said the reshuffle ``is to eliminate
the shadow of the scandal from the government and to make a fresh
start.''
   He noted that none of the politicians implicated in the scandal
was included in Takeshita's new Cabinet, ``but the real problem,
which the new Cabinet will inevitably face, is the fact that
Takeshita himself was linked to the scandal.''
   Apart from the new Justice Ministry appointment, analysts said
the reshuffle was routine and they expected no significant changes
in government policies.
   Prime ministers customarily rotate senior members of the Liberal
Democratic Party through ministerial posts without changing the
power balance among major factions in the party. The Liberal
Democrats have run Japan for 33 years. But for a brief period in
1947-48 when the leftist Social Democratic Party was in power, they
and their conservative predecessors have governed since the end of
World War II.
   Murayama has held his post since Saturday. His predecessor,
Kiichi Miyazawa, resigned on Dec. 9, taking responsibility for his
link to the scandal.
   Opposition demands for a complete probe into the scandal slowed
parliamentary debate on tax reform and led to the resignation of 17
influential politicians and business leaders, including Miyazawa and
Hisashi Shinto, chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., a
telecommunications giant.
   The Liberal Democrats, however, parried the opposition skillfully
and pushed the tax reform package through parliament by using a
commanding majority in both houses.
   The first sweeping overhaul of the country's postwar tax system
had been a pending issue for the governing party for more than a
decade, but successive adminstrations were stymied by a lack of
public support and opposition criticism.

   The dollar fell slightly in Europe early today in
trading thinned by the continued closure of London's financial
markets for the Christmas holiday. Gold rose in Zurich.
   ``The market is pretty well dead throughout Europe,'' said one
foreign currency dealer in Rome.
   In addition to the lack of activity in Britain, most trading
rooms in other European countries were lightly staffed today, with
traders taking holidays in the week before New Year's.
   Traders said the dollar is expected to remain trendless
throughout the week, but warned the lack of volume may lead to
unexpectedly volatile currency swings.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.08 yen from Monday's close to end the day at
124.80. Later, in Europe, it was quoted at 124.82 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe at midmorning today, compared with
late rates in London on Friday:
   _1.7758 West German marks, down from 1.7760
   _1.4972 Swiss francs, down from 1.4980
   _6.0650 French francs, down from 6.0690

   _1,307.50 Italian lire, down from 1,309.80
   _1.1960 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19625
   The British pound rose to $1.8025, compared with $1.80125 in
London on Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price for gold was $418.20 a troy ounce, up
from $416.30 bid late Friday.
   Bullion markets were closed in both London and Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Minnesota Commission Recommends Separate Indian School District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Legislature should establish the
nation's first American Indian-run urban school district to focus on
the special educational needs of native American children, a group
of educators recommends.
   The 15-member Indian School Council, created by the Legislature
last February, recently submitted a preliminary report recommending
that the special district open a school in the Twin Cities by the
fall of 1990.
   Minnesota's Indian children, who have had some of the public
school system's lowest test scores and highest dropout rates, would
not be required to attend the school. But the council said it
believes the Twin Cities' Indian community would overwhelmingly
support such a school, which they anticipate would be three-quarters
Indian.
   Supporters of the plan say they hope an Indian-run school that
puts the needs of Indians first will instill self-confidence and
pride in students about their Indian heritage and reduce the stream
of dropouts from public schools.
   The supporters also say an Indian-controlled school would
encourage support from Indian parents, who traditionally have seen
education as a tool of white society to separate them from their
Indian identity.
   ``The idea is to make what is public about public education
closer to the constituents' students,'' said David Beaulieu,
director of Indian education for the state Department of Education
and a member of the Indian School Council. ``You can change the
child to fit the school, or you can change the school to fit the
child.''
   ``It's real clear that public education is not working well for a
lot of American Indians,'' he said. ``So I'm in favor of anything
that I can be convinced will increase student achievement.''
   The Legislature opened the door for the creation of an urban
Indian-run school district when it created the Indian School Council
during the past session.
   But the report arrives at a time when metropolitan school
districts are wrestling with the question of how to desegregate, and
the idea of a predominantly Indian school flies in the face of that
ideal.
   Indian-run reservation schools are commonplace, but an Indian-run
public school in an urban setting would be unique and involve
meshing the tenets of mainstream education with traditional Indian
ideas, such as the study of tribal law and culture.
   Such a school would place Indian concerns first because the
majority of students in this case would be composed of Indians, said
Don Allery, chairman of the Indian School Council and tribal
historian for the Red Lake Indian Reservation.
   ``Who controls the system is who dictates the priorities,''
Allery said last week.
   But the Indian School Council was not unanimous in its
recommendation of the school proposal.
   St. Paul School Board member Eleanor Weber, who sat on the
council as a representative of her school board, says the
Legislature should consider alternatives, such as creating an Indian
magnet school in an existing school district, recruiting more Indian
teachers, and beefing up funding for existing Indian education
programs.
   ``The viewpoint I have heard is that there is something
inherently beneficial about the education of Indians by Indians,''
she said. ``Now, I have yet to see the evidence.''
   The report's authors say they envision a school that includes
grades K-12 located in the metropolitan area. No site or even
preferred city was named in the report.
   Minneapolis has the metro area's largest concentration of Indian
students _ slightly less than 3,000 or about 7.5 percent of its
39,500 total student population. St. Paul has about 900 Indian
students, or 3 percent of its 33,000 student body.
   The report does not set the school's size, but estimates by
supporters have ranged from 500 to 3,000 students.

   A day after claiming it freed and sent two
French girls home from 13 months of captivity, an extremist
Palestinian faction today said it could not ``set a specific date''
for their arrival in France.
   In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said it was expecting the arrival
of the two girls, but would not elaborate.
   A spokesman for Fatah-Revolutionary Council announced in Lebanon
Monday that Maurie-Laure Betille, 7, and her 6-year-old sister
Virginia, who had been abducted with their mother and five Belgians,
had been released and were on their way to Paris in an airplane.
   But the spokesman, Walid Khaled, said today: ``I cannot set a
specific date for their arrival in Paris or say anything more than
what has been mentioned in the statement I have just released.''
   In the statement, Khaled said the group's leader, terrorist
mastermind Abu Nidal, had met the girls and approved security
arrangements for their transportation to Paris. He did not say when
the meeting occurred.
   Earlier today, another man who answered the phone at the group's
information office maintained: ``The two sisters are on their way to
Paris. Arrival time depends on weather conditions over the
Mediterranean.''
   The man did not elaborate and would not identify himself.
   Several Mediterranean countries have been struck since Monday by
a winter storm.
   Khaled announced on Nov. 8, 1987 that his group had seized eight
French and Belgian nationals aboard their French-registered yacht,
the Silko, off the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. The
Fatah-Revolutionary Council accused them of spying for Israel.
Israel denied it.
   Some news reports have said the captives were being held in south
Lebanon, and others said they were in Libya.
   The girls' mother, Jacqueline Valente, gave birth to a baby girl
in captivity and is due to deliver again in January, Khaled said.
Since her separation from her husband, Pierre Betille, Ms. Valente
has been living with Fernand Houtekins, one of the five Belgian
captives.
   The other four captives are Houtekins' elder brother, Emmanuel,
Emmanuel's wife, Godelieve, and the couple's two children, Laurent,
17, and Valerie, 16.
   Not counting the Silko captives, 15 foreigners, including nine
Americans, are missing and believed held hostage in Lebanon. The
longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Assoiciated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri Banna, formed
Fatah-Revolutionary Council in 1976 after splitting from the
Palestine Liberation Organization. He is wanted by many countries
for masterminding hijackings, bombings and assassinations.
   His group is bankrolled by Libya and believed responsible for the
killings of three hostages in Lebanon following a U.S. air attack on
Libya in April 1985.
   The gunshot bodies of Peter Kilburn, 61, of San Francisco and
British hostages Leigh Douglas, 34, and Philip Padfield, 40, were
found in Lebanon three days after the attack.
   A stenciled note found near the corpses said they were
``executed'' by the Arab Revolutionary Cells to avenge the raid. The
Arab Revolutionary Cells is one of several names Abu Nidal's
activists have used when they claim attacks.

   A winter storm dumped sleet and nearly a
foot of snow on parts of this arid kingdom today, knocking out power
to thousands of homes and shutting schools and universities,
officials said.
   More than 4 inches of snow fell on portions of this hilly
capital, home to about 1 million people.
   Ali Abandah, director of the National Weather Service, said more
than 11 inches fell on the town of Shobak in the southern mountains
and at Tafileh, about 80 miles south of the capital.
   Abandah said snow also fell on the northern part of the country,
accompanied by 56 mph winds. He said the temperature fell to about
19 degrees in Shobak and it was about 28 degrees in Amman.
   The snow and water closed some highways and soldiers helped city
workers clean the streets.
   Officials reported no major accidents or fatalities.
   Several thousand homes were without power at various times Monday
night and this morning as utility crews battled ice-laden power
lines and tree limbs, said Mustafa Rawad, a utility inspector.
   Jordan's three universites closed and Education Minister Thoukan
Hindawi called off the midyear certificate examination scheduled
today. More than 59,000 secondary school students were to take the
crucial test.
   Abandah said the storm moved had through Cyprus, Turkey, Jordan
and northern Iraq.
   Amman usually receives snowfall once or twice a year, though in
smaller amounts.

<HEAD>Last Italian Fascist Party Leader Dead at 91</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLORENCE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlo Scorza, the last leader of Italy's
Fascist Party, has died at his home near Florence at the age of 91.
   Scorza died Friday in Castagno d'Andrea, 30 miles northeast of
Florence, where he had lived with his daughter Riccarda Maria since
1982. His death was announced by his family after his burial in Rome.
   Scorza was named secretary of the Fascist Party by dictator
Benito Mussolini on April 17, 1943, just three months before the
fall of the regime. He was the last survivor of the party hierarchy
that took part in the meeting July 25, 1943, when the party council
voted to end Mussolini's reign.
   Although he had promised to vote for the council's proposal,
Scorza remained faithful to Mussolini and voted for the continuation
of the party and the war.
   Scorza was born June 15, 1897 in the Calabria town of Paola.
While still a boy, Scorza and his family moved to Lucca in Tuscany.
At 18, he enlisted and fought in World War I, emerging with the rank
of lieutenant and three medals. He later finished his studies and
earned a degree in accounting.
   Scorza registered with the Fascist Party in 1920 and dedicated
himself to the party youth movement. In 1928, he founded and was
editor of a party newspaper, ``The Tuscan People.'' He continued to
move up in the party ranks, but was ignored by the party's inner
circles until Mussolini chose him as party secretary.
   In 1946, Scorza left Italy for Argentina, where he lived until
1955. He returned to Italy in 1961 and in 1968 published a book of
memoirs, ``The Night of the Great Meeting.''

   Volunteers treated 700 waterfowl in a
makeshift bird hospital, as 100 more birds were found dead in the
wake of a 70,000-gallon oil spill.
   The cleanup of contaminated beaches should be completed by the
middle of the week, Ron Holcomb of the state Department of Ecology
said Monday.
   The spill occurred Thursday when the oil barge Nestucca collided
with the tug Ocean Express, which was towing it off Grays Harbor.
   Oil-fouled waterfowl have been reported as far as 40 miles north
of this coastal resort town, with 400 birds found dead since the
spill occurred. About 700 contaminated birds have been plucked from
beaches and given fluids and food at a makeshift bird hospital at
the Hoquiam Middle School.
   About 100 birds had been scrubbed to remove the oil from their
feathers as of late Monday, said Jay Holcomb of the International
Bird Rescue Research Center in Berkeley, Calif.
   The rescued waterfowl, mostly open-ocean birds such as murres,
are being fed twice a day with smelt. Of those treated, 25 percent
to 65 percent are expected to survive, officials said.
   Oil ruins the insulating effect of a bird's feathers, which can
cause death from the cold, said state biologist Pam Miller. Birds
can also be poisoned from oil they ingest while cleaning their
feathers.
   The cleanup Monday focused on the most contaminated beaches, just
south of Ocean Shores, with 25 workers using shovels and rakes to
scoop the clumps of oil into plastic bags for disposal.
   No damage estimate has been reported.

   A Briton imprisoned in Iran for more than two years
on weapons charges returned home today after being released from a
Tehran prison.
   Nicholas Nicola, 23, was met by his father and by Foreign Office
officials at London's Heathrow Airport following his arrival on an
Iran Air flight.
   He smiled as he walked down the airplane's steps, and was then
driven directly out of the airport from the aircraft without
commenting on his ordeal. The Foreign Office would not disclose his
whereabouts.
   News of Nicola's release first came from the English-Language
newspaper Tehran Times, which reported today that he had been turned
over to British Charge d'Affaires Gordon Pirie on Monday.
   The newspaper report was carried by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency and later confirmed by the British Foreign Office.
   Britain said Nicola, a tourist traveling by land from Pakistan
when arrested, had been held without trial since September 1986. But
the IRNA report said he had been officially charged, tried and
sentenced to 3{ years in prison for ``the possession of two weapons
and a number of cartridges.''
   It said Nicola was freed because of ``good behavior in prison.''
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman called the release ``an
important step forward.''
   ``The Iranians up until now have been in breach of the Vienna
Convention in refusing to give adequate consular access to detained
Britains,'' said the spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with
British custom.
   Britain and Iran agreed Dec. 9 to restore diplomatic ties, ending
a 19-month strain that began when an Iranian envoy was arrested in
Manchester, northern England, on shoplifting charges in May 1987.
   Earlier this year, a British diplomat, David Reddaway, was
allowed to visit Nicola and another Briton, Roger Cooper, at
Tehran's maximum security Evin prison. He reported both men were
physically fit.
   Cooper, 52, a businessman who has lived in Iran for more than 20
years, was originally detained in November 1985 for overstaying his

   Nicola's release raised hopes that Cooper may soon be freed. The
gradual easing for strain between the two countries may also signal
new hope for British hostages believed held in Lebanon.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican envoy Terry Waite,
journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man
with dual British and Irish nationality whose release is also sought
by the Irish government.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a New
York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they
killed him. His body was never found.
   They are among 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing
and believed held in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was
abducted March 16, 1985.

   A three-alarm fire destroyed
the home of millionaire industrialist Edgar Kaiser, including his
art collection, authorities said.
   At the height of the Christmas Day fire, about 40 firefighters
were battling the blaze in the expensive Point Grey area of
Vancouver near the University of British Columbia.
   Kaiser, 45, and his family escaped unharmed, but a fire captain
suffered minor injuries when part of a wall collapsed on him.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation. Fire Chief Bob
Babcock said Kaiser, a house guest and the staff fled without injury
when the guest saw a Christmas tree had caught fire.
   Neighbors, who said the house was about 2 months old, quoted
Kaiser as saying, ``The art collection is all gone. I just want to
be left alone.''
   There were no immediate details on the contents of his collection.
   Antique and specialty cars in an underground concrete garage
escaped damage, and a Lamborghini and a Porsche were moved to a
neighbor's house to avoid damage as the flames spread, fire
officials said.
   Kaiser is the grandson of the late U.S. steel magnate Henry
Kaiser. He heads Kaiser Resources Ltd. of Vancouver, a private
company with holdings in raw materials, aerospace and electronics,
real estate and financial services.
   Earlier this year, he flew his 11-seat executive jet around the
world in two days to raise money for and awareness of his
substance-abuse foundation.
   The foundation was set up with a $2.5 million endowment from the
Kaiser family.
   Kaiser, who became a Canadian citizen in 1981, is a former owner
of the Denver Broncos of the National Football League. He sold the
team in 1984 for a reported $70 million.

   Doctors gave Emperor Hirohito a blood transfusion
when his blood pressure fell today, the 100th day he has been
bedridden since suffering severe internal bleeding, palace officials
said.
   Officials said the 87-year-old monarch discharged a small amount
of blood, but his condition was stable by evening.
   Doctors gave Hirohito 0.85 pints of blood in the morning when his
systolic blood pressure dropped below 100 and his temperture started
rising, Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said.
   Doctors believed the lower blood pressure resulted from internal
bleeding, Maeda said.
   Hirohito's grandson Prince Aya, the second son of Crown Prince
Akihito, was to return from Britain Wednesday to visit him, a palace
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It will be the third return trip for Prince Aya from his zoology
studies at Oxford University. The prince rushed back in early
October and again in November when Hirohito's condition suddenly
deteriorated. He returned to Oxford after his grandfather's
condition stabilized in mid-November.
   Hirohito's blood pressure during his regular checkup this morning
was 92 over 50, down from 108 over 58 Wednesday evening. An average
reading is about 120 over 80.
   The emperor's temperature stood at 100.2 degrees, sharply up from
recent readings of around 97 degrees. His normal temperature is 95.9.
   Hirohito has discharged blood intermittently since Sept. 19 due
to internal bleeding believed to be in his upper intestinal region,
where he underwent a bypass operation in September 1987.
   Doctors have given Hirohito 60.2 pints of blood transfusions
since then to combat his waning strength and blood loss.
   Reports on the emperor's condition vary. Maeda said that while
Hirohito spends most of his time asleep, he was been able to react
by nodding when doctors spoke to him on Sunday and Monday.
   Recent media reports citing palace sources, however, have
described the monarch as nearly comatose.
   Palace sources have refused to comment on reports that the
monarch is suffering from cancer.

   A bomb exploded in a home west of the
capital and killed a 14-year-old youth, police and family members
said today.
   Oboyo Ovoyaobe, an electrical company worker, said his wife and
two children were asleep in the house with him when the bomb went
off at about midnight Monday. He said his son Tebogo was killed
instantly and his wife, Kolobetso, was hospitalized with injuries.
   A neighbor, Naledi Sepateng, said a car with license plates of
the South African homeland of Bophuthatswana passed by three or four
times before the bombing. She said there were four blacks inside the
car.
   Two people were killed earlier this month in a bombing, and
witnesses identified the men responsible for the bombing as being
from Bophuthatswana.
   Most Botswana citizens are from the same tribe as the people who
live in the nominally-independent South African homeland of
Bophuthatswana. Botswana does not recognize the homeland government.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's
explosion. Botswana usually blames bombings on South African
security forces, but no official statement was made today.

<TEXT>
   A derailed train was placed back
on track and passengers were bused on their way as investigators
probed the cause of an Amtrak derailment that stranded 309 people
overnight in a snowy canyon.
   Two of three locomotives and 15 passengers cars of the California
Zephyr derailed in heavy snow Sunday night, about eight miles east
of Glenwood Springs. The train, en route from Chicago to the West
Coast, remained upright.
   The 294 passengers and 15 crew members were stranded aboard the
train overnight but had heat and light, said John Jacobsen, Amtrak
director of public relations in Washington, D.C. A work train
brought the passengers here Monday in two trips aboard seven
cabooses.
   While railroad crews lifted the derailed train back onto the
tracks, most passengers went to Salt Lake City on four chartered
buses. About 25 people returned to Denver on another chartered bus.
   Officials from Amtrak, the Rio Grande and the National
Transportation Safety Board examined evidence at the wreck site. Rio
Grande leases track to Amtrak for the California Zephyr.
   ``We know the cars were forced off the track, but whether it was
the track or the equipment or something else, we won't know for
awhile,'' Jacobsen said.
   Earlier, Jacobsen said the rails on the roadbed 15 feet above the
Colorado River were ``spread apart enough to cause the wheels to
drop into a ridge between the rails.''
   Investigators will examine the equipment, the tracks, the speed
of the train and the weather, among other factors, officials said.

   A group of blacks opened fire
with an automatic rifle inside a house in Soweto, killing four black
men and a woman, police said today.
   A man and a woman also were injured in the shooting before
midnight Sunday in the black township west of Johannesburg, police
said.
   They said they did not know the motive for the shootings.
   One of the dead men was a police constable, according to police,
who gave no other details.
   Black police officers often have been targets during political
unrest because some black militants consider them to be
collaborators with South Africa's white-led government.
   Two police officers have been killed and several wounded in
attacks with automatic rifles in Soweto in recent months, but there
have been no arrests, the South African Press Association said.

   A small bomb exploded today in the business
district of Jerusalem, but no one was injured and there was no
damage, a police spokesman said.
   The bomb was planted in a trash can outside a clothing store
crowded with shoppers at the intersection of Jaffa Road and King
George Street, said police spokesman Rafi Levy.
   ``This is definitely a terrorist attack,'' Levy said. He said
police arrested 13 Arabs in the area for questioning.
   Police blocked off Jaffa Road for a half hour after the 9:30 a.m.
blast and hundreds of people watched explosives experts as they
inspected the contents of the trash can.
   The explosion blew the lid off the bin, which remained intact,
Levy said. Special trash cans with reinforced steel linings that can
withstand blasts have been installed in central Jerusalem in recent
months.
   Before that, there were no public trash cans on the city's
sidewalks for several years because they frequently had been used to
plant bombs.

   The police chief arrested his brother

   Chief Ralph August jailed his brother, Stephen, on public
drunkenness and disorderly conduct charges after he disconnected the
tree's lights, refused to go home, followed the chief to a
convenience store and shouted obscenities. He later set fire to a
jail mattress, the chief said.
   ``He wanted to take me outside and beat my head,'' the chief

   The 41-year-old chief said it was the fourth time he has arrested
his brother.
   ``My brother has a habit of not liking the law to tell him what

   August, 37, a construction worker, spent the holiday in jail and
was released Monday after pleading guilty to the charges, agreeing
to pay court costs and a $300 fine and promising to paint the

<TEXT>
   Jeb Bush said today that the trip he and his
son took to deliver supplies to earthquake victims in Armenia
exemplified the ``thousand points of light'' his father,
President-elect Bush, talked about during the presidential campaign.
   ``You remember during the campaign my dad did talk in political
terms about the thousand points of light,'' said the
president-elect's son on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``And this is an
example of it,'' he said.
   ``It's one example of hundreds of things that are occurring in
this country and outside this country,'' he said.
   Jeb Bush and his son, George, 12, flew to Soviet Armenia
Christmas eve on an airlift to deliver toys and medical supplies to
victims of the earthquake that struck there three weeks ago. The
trip was sponsored by Americares, a Connecticut-based relief
organization.
   Bush, 35, a Miami real estate developer, said he had talked to
his father since he returned from the humanitarian effort and ``he
was proud of us and very pleased at the response both in the Soviet
Union and in the United States.''
   In a separate interview on ``CBS This Morning'' Bush described
the hospital visits to children injured in the tragedy as
particularly moving and ``something that'll be with him (his son)
for the rest of his life.''
   ``I think he got an appreciation that he is lucky to be living in
this country. I think we both came back with that feeling. He got an
appreciation of what it is to suffer, to see human tragedy. And I
think he grew up by being through that experience,'' Bush said.

   Authorities today held about 140 African students
and six Americans in a Nanking hotel after a weekend of clashes
between Chinese and black African students.
   Thousands of Chinese youths chanting ``Kill the black ghosts!''
on Monday surrounded the central Chinese city's train station as the
students tried to depart for the capital by train, American
witnesses said.
   But police would not let the Africans embark, one American
student said.
   Chinese students at a university in Nanking did not attend
classes today and officials at another school urged students not to
participate in further demonstrations, American students said.
   Several truckloads of police patrolled the city, the Americans
said.
   The clashes and demonstrations, which began Saturday and lasted
until Monday night, are the latest in a series of incidents between
Chinese and China's 1,500 African students. Two years ago, the
government crushed widespread student demonstrations seeking greater
democracy.
   China prides itself on its good ties with African countries.
Relations between the Africans and Chinese, however, have often been
strained. Chinese often are openly racist, saying they find black
people dirty.
   The problem is compounded because African students in China are
mostly single men, who spend up to six years here and want to date
Chinese women.
   ``Chinese teachers and students think this is improper,
especially with African men,'' said a U.S. diplomat.
   The six Americans held at the hotel, all of whom are white, went
to the train station with the Africans to express solidarity with
them. The U.S. diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the protests did not have an anti-American character.
   He said after talking to the students that they were being
treated well but wanted to return to their universities. ``The
average student feels he is being held against his will,'' he said.
   The American students included five women and one man, and are
from U.S. universities such as Duke University in North Carolina and
Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Their names were not released.
   Huang Jie, an official at the Jiangsu province foreign affairs
office, said most of the students had returned to their schools. But
the U.S. diplomat and officials at several schools in Nanking said
this was not true.
   The U.S. official also said that ambassadors from three African
countries met with the African students today to talk about their
safety concerns.
   The incident in Nanking began when African students at Hehai
University wanted to bring two Chinese women to a party but refused
a guard's request for the women's identification.
   In a brawl that followed, 11 Chinese and two Africans were
injured, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
   Later Sunday, Hehai's 70 African students fled the school for the
Nanking train station where they were joined by Africans from other
schools, along with the six Americans.
   On Sunday night, Chinese police stopped them from taking a train
to Beijing.
   Monday afternoon, a crowd of about 5,000 Chinese marched to the
train station and 2,000 succeeded in getting around a police
barricade, American witnesses said.
   The Africans only left the train station after Chinese officials
told them they would let the Chinese students inside if they didn't
leave.
   Joe Profaizer, an English teacher at Nanking University, said the
Chinese students who participated in the march Monday said they were
doing so because they ``didn't believe the government was interested
in upholding the law.''
   However, other Americans said they believed the fundamental
nature of the protests remained anti-black.
   Profaizer said Chinese students at Nanking University told him
they had been told not to demonstrate. Chinese students also told
him that students at Hehai University had not attended classes
today, he said.
   Africans and Chinese have had a series of clashes over the last
few years.
   In 1986 a fight broke out between African and Chinese students in
the northeastern port city of Tianjin, and 18 Africans fled to
safety in Beijing. About 200 African students in the capital staged
a march through Beijing streets complaining of racial discrimination
against blacks.
   In 1980, 19 Africans and Arabs and 24 Chinese were injured in a
fight in Shanghai that began over loud music from a foreigner's
radio.

<TEXT>
   The PLO's executive committee today
rejected a reported Israeli plan to grant limited autonomy to
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and allow them
to elect their own representatives.
   The 15-member ruling body of the Palestine Liberation
Organization called the idea a ``new maneuver aimed at diverting
world attention away from Palestinian peace overtures.''
   On Monday, the Israeli daily Maariv said Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir planned to propose an Egyptian role in getting negotiations
started between Israel and a joint delegation of Palestinians and
representatives from Jordan.
   The aim of such talks would be to reach an interim agreement for
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza, the newspaper said.
   The PLO comments came in a statement issued today, a day after
the executive committee ended a three-day meeting in Baghdad, Iraq.
Text of the statement was made available to news agencies in Nicosia.
   The PLO statement said that Palestinians will not endorse any
settlement that falls short of the establishment of an independent
state to co-exist with Israel.
   It cautioned world public opinion ``against falling for the
latest Israeli trick,'' and stressed: ``Israel must withdraw from
the occupied territories which must be placed under United Nations
supervision for an interim, transitional period.
   ``As for the latest election farce, the Palestinians have already
chosen their representatives _ the Palestine Liberation
Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinians.''
   The PLO has repeatedly rejected the idea of limited autonomy for
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, occupied by Israel since the
1967 Middle East war.
   The PLO statement today saluted the 90 countries it said have
recognized the independent Palestinian state proclaimed Nov. 15 by
the Palestine National Council, the group's parliament-in-exile.
   Palestinian sources said the committee members agreed to seek to
upgrade PLO offices in countries that have recognized the
still-symbolic state from information centers to embassies.
   The committee's sessions were devoted mainly to the U.S.-PLO
dialogue, which began earlier this month when Washington reversed a
13-year ban on contacts with the organization.
   Washington reversed the ban after PLO chief Yasser Arafat said
the PLO recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.

   Daw Khin Kyi, widow of Burmese independence
leader Gen. Aung San, died today after a long illness, her family
said. She was 76.
   Daw Khin Kyi, whose husband was assassinated in 1947, was the
mother of Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
   Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Rangoon in April from her exile in
London to look after her mother, who had been bedridden since
suffering a stroke earlier this year.
   Daw Khin Kyi is to be buried Jan. 2 in Rangoon near the graves of
the last Burmese queen and of U Thant, the former U.N.
secretary-general.
   After returning to Rangoon, Aung San Suu Kyi took a leading role
in the pro-democracy demonstrations that swept Burma. The
demonstrations were crushed in a September military coup, and Aung
San Suu Kyi has since become a leader of the major opposition party,
the National League For Democracy.

   The first of the dead have been
identified from Pan Am Flight 103, and investigators today began
tests on a suitcase for clues as to whether a bomb or structural
failure caused Britain's worst air disaster.
   Police said they hoped to release five or six bodies to next of
kin today once the last formality of registering the death in
Lockerbie was completed. Names and nationalities were not issued.
   One more victim was found Monday, bringing the total in two
temporary morgues in the city hall and an ice rink to 240.
   Pan Am said today it had determined that another infant was on
board Flight 103, bringing the total of passengers and crew on the
plane to 259. Eleven townspeople are still listed as missing and
feared dead.
   After three days of constant rain, more than 600 rescue workers
resumed their search under clear skies today for the remaining
victims and for missing wreckage, including sections of the
airplane's wings.
   Police divers joined the rescue effort, searching the icy,
rain-swollen waters of the lakes, reservoirs and bogs in the 100
square miles of rugged terrain and dense woods surrounding the crash
zone.
   Civilian and Royal Air Force pathologists and a group of
orthodontists examined bodies in temporary morgues in the town hall
and ice rink, but expected the identification process would take
another 10 days.
   Police spokesman Angus Kennedy said today three more men had been
arrested after being found in possession of parts of the aircraft.
   The men, ages 20, 21 and 40, will appear in court on Wednesday,
along with a 28-year-old man who was arrested Monday for looting at
the crash.
   ``I am disgusted with certain things I have seen _ at the very
thought that something like this could happen in the midst of all
this, when everyone else is trying to help,'' said Paul Newall, the
area's chief deputy constable.
   A suspect suitcase and an unspecified amount of wreckage were
sent Monday to the Royal Armament Research and Development
Establishment in southern England ``for more detailed examination to
determine whether they exhibit evidence of a pre-impact explosion,''
Michael Charles, the top British investigator on the scene, said in
a statement.
   Transport Department press officer Penny Russell-Smith said the
tests began today and might be concluded ``as early as tonight or
perhaps a few days.''
   The Times of London reported that the suitcase, noticed lying
among wreckage, was ripped and torn and might have been damaged by
flying metal. The report said the Fort Halstead scientists ``should
quickly be able to establish whether those marks were made by an
exploding bomb.''
   Charles' statement added that although no evidence of structural
failure had turned up, that was still being probed as a possible
cause.
   Structural failure or a bomb have been identified by experts as
the most likely reasons why the Pan Am plane disappeared from radar
screens just as it reached cruising altitude of 31,000 feet over
southwest Scotland on Dec. 21.
   The Daily Mail newspaper said without attribution:
``Circumstantial evidence points to a bomb being planted in a
suitcase loaded into the forward baggage compartment beneath the
flight deck and the first class cabin. This part of the aircraft was
ripped away from the main structure of the fuselage.''
   The New York-bound flight originated as a Boeing 727 from
Frankfurt, West Germany, with a change of planes at London's
Heathrow airport. Federal police in West Germany and the commander
of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad last week began
investigations at those airports.
   Monday was Boxing Day in the long British Christmas celebration,
and a day of more public grief at the Roman Catholic church in
Lockerbie, where the Rev. Patrick Keegans celebrated a requiem Mass.
   ``Confronted with the horror of such loss, we feel empty, hurt,
confused, and we say to ourselves, `things will never be the same
again,''' Keegans said in a brief homily.
   ``As Christ did on the Cross we too scream at the Father, `My
God, my God, why have you abandoned me?' He does not seem to answer.
There is only silence....
   Keegans, who has been counseling both parishioners and relatives
arriving from other countries, lost his home in the crash.

<HEAD>Mayoral Foes Ask Special Prosecutor in Daley Petition Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Democratic contenders facing Cook County
State's Attorney Richard M. Daley in next year's mayoral primary
want an investigation into charges that Daley staff members
submitted illegal referendum petitions.
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer and Aldermen Tim Evans and Larry Bloom issued
the calls in separate appearances Monday after the Chicago Tribune
reported Sunday it had found ``strong evidence'' that the petition
gathering by employees of Daley and other Democratic party regulars
had violated election laws.
   At least nine employees of Daley's office or their family members
circulated petitions and gathered dozens of handwritten names of
people who said they never signed the petitions, the newspaper said.
   The petition drive in 1985 and 1986 was to put on the ballot a
measure that would prevent a candidate from winning a party primary
without a majority of the vote by instituting a non-partisan general
election.
   Daley ran unsuccessfully against the late Harold Washington in
the 1983 Democratic primary, when he split the white vote with Mayor
Jane Byrne. Washington went on to win the general election to become
the city's first black mayor.
   An investigation was launched two years ago when allies of
Washington charged the petition drive was fraught with abuse, but
the state's attorney's office has not brought any charges. The
three-year statute of limitations is about to end.
   ``We should get a special prosecutor and get it done,'' said
Sawyer, who is running to retain his job. ``I think we ought to
aggressively pursue this. Forgery is forgery.''
   Daley's spokeswoman, Avis LaVelle, suggested the calls for a
special prosecutor were politically motivated, noting that Daley had
removed himself from his office's investigation of possible fraud
and forgery during the 1985-86 drive.

   Contra rebels say they have
released, on the Nicaraguan border, 104 captives they had held for
at least a year in Honduras.
   In a separate development Monday, an umbrella organization for
Contra and internal opposition groups said it had requested a
meeting with President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua next week so it
can offer a peace proposal.
   In Honduras, a spokesman for the rebels said all prisoners were
turned over to Red Cross, Roman Catholic church and human rights
representatives near the border towns of Trojes and Capire.
   The rebel spokesman, identified as Commander Johnson, said the
prisoners released Friday included more than 70 former soldiers of
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   He said they had been captured in battles more than a year ago.
   The Red Cross and the Honduran Foreign Ministry refused to
confirm that former Sandinista soldiers had been released.
   Honduran authorities prevented journalists from going to the
towns, about 250 miles east of Tegucigalpa.
   Johnson said ``all prisoners were in good physical condition.''
   At a news conference Dec. 20, Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez
Contreras of Honduras said the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contras'
political arm, was holding at least 104 captives in Honduras.
   ``The government has knowledge that there are more and will
continue efforts to free all of all of them,'' he said.
   He also said that President Jose Azcona Hoyo had asked the Red
Cross, the church and the Inter-institutional Human Rights
Commission to ``initiate efforts to rescue the Nicaraguan captives.''
   The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting the Sandinistas since
1981 and the conflict has by government count claimed at least
26,500 lives. The two sides agreed to a truce in March, but further
negotiations have deadlocked.
   The request to meet Ortega Jan. 4 and deliver a peace proposal to
him was made by the Democratic Center Coalition, which was created
in October within the Nicaraguan Resistance.
   In a telephone interview, a coalition spokesman, Octaviano Cesar,
said the group had sent two letters to Nicaraguan officials since
Dec. 19, but the government had not answered.
   The peace proposal calls for the formation of a ``reconstruction
commission'' made up of business, labor and government leaders.
   Cesar said the coalition will present the peace proposal to the
other Central American countries so it might be discussed at a
meeting of the region's foreign ministers in Managua on Jan. 12-13
and at the regional presidential summit two days later.
   The Democratic Center Coalition is considered to offer itself as
an alternative to right-wing forces in the Nicaraguan Resistance.

<HEAD>Two Babies Abandoned in Florida, Maryland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two babies abandoned on Christmas Day _ one after his mother gave
birth and left a Baltimore hospital and the second in a parking
garage at a Sarasota, Fla., hospital _ were reported in good
condition today.
   Officials in both states said the boys would be placed in foster
care if their parents couldn't be located. A young couple who found
``Baby Nicholas'' in the hospital garage said they want to adopt him.
   The 6-pound, 2-ounce infant nicknamed ``Noel'' was born in Sinai
Hospital after a woman walked into the Baltimore hospital early
Sunday, gave birth under a false name less than an hour later and
left the recovery room, officials said.
   Police traced a woman who they had been led to believe was the
baby's mother but she was still pregnant, police Sgt. Thomas Berends
said.
   If found, the mother could face a charge of abandonment, Berends
said.
   Steve and Robbi Carroll, who have been married for 13 months,
found ``Baby Nicholas'' wrapped in a patchwork quilt in the parking
garage at Sarasota Memorial Hospital and took him to the emergency
room.
   ``We found him and we should get to keep him,'' said Robbi
Carroll, 33. ``We both fell instantly in love with him. He's such a
pretty baby. I don't understand how anybody could abandon him.''
   The infant, hospital officials said, was several days old and
weighed almost seven pounds.
   Steve Carroll, 30, said the baby was a ``a gift from heaven,''
adding he hopes that the couple will be given an opportunity to
adopt him. They have been married for 13 months but are unable to
have children of their own, he said.
   Hospital spokesman Richard Field said the hospital has received
``at least half a dozen'' other offers to adopt the child.
   Sarasota Memorial officials say they're certain that the infant
was not born at that hospital. The parents of the child could face
criminal charges of child abuse if they're found, Sarasota police
said.

<HEAD>Minister: Mubarak Visit Conditional on Israeli Dialogue with PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURICE GUINDI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt wants Israel to agree to talk to the
Palestine Liberation Organization before President Hosni Mubarak
will visit the Jewish state, a Cabinet minister said today.
   Butros Ghali, minister of state for foreign affairs and Egypt's
second-ranking diplomat, set the condition today in a statement to
reporters.
   ``Egypt always has emphasized the importance of dialogue and
contact between the PLO and Israel,'' Ghali said.
   ``In light of this objective, President Hosni Mubarak is prepared
to visit Israel if it agrees to dialogue with the PLO,'' he said.
   Such a condition would virtually rule out a visit by Mubarak to
Israel, which views the PLO as a terrorist group and refuses to deal
with it. Rejection of any dialogue with the PLO is part of the
coalition agreement signed last week by Israel's Likud bloc and
Labor Party.
   Mubarak made a qualified offer to visit Israel in interviews with
the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Anbaa and the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri in
the last few days.
   ``Why not go?'' he said when Al-Anbaa asked if he would visit
Israel to solve the Palestinian issue. ``If this visit would lead to
solving the problem, and if it would lead to establishing a just
peace, then I am ready.''
   Mubarak told Yomiuri he had no firm intention to visit Israel but
again offered to go if necessary to achieve peace. ``But it
depends,'' he added. ``I don't accept any preconditions.''
   Mubarak's remarks were immediately welcomed in Israel and the
United States. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, however,
said the Egyptians must attach no preconditions to the visit.
   Ghali was among the architects of the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace
teaty, the only one between an Arab county and the Jewish state. He
has held his ministerial post since President Anwar Sadat visited
Israel in 1977 to launch a peace initiative.
   Ghali's statement today was supported by other government
sources, who said a Mubarak visit to Israel was ``almost
unimaginable'' unless Shamir changed his opposition to an
international peace the conference and accepted the PLO as a
negotiating partner.
   The sources said there have been no meetings in Cairo between any
Israeli Embassy diplomat and any Foreign Ministry official on a
Mubarak visit, contrary to statements made Monday by Shamir's
spokesmen, Avi Pazner.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials appeared today to be playing down
the probability of a Mubarak visit.
   ``Maybe the (Mubarak) statement was given much more importance
than Mubarak meant,'' an Israeli Foreign Ministry official said. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>May Be Better To Resist Attacker Than Submit, UCLA Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may be better to resist an attacker than
submit to a sexual assault, according to a new study from the
University of California, Los Angeles.
   The study, published in the January issue of the American Journal
of Public Health, suggests resistance is most effective when the
assailant is making verbal threats, but probably is futile in
response to physical violence.
   ``The bottom line is ... resistance does little to increase one's
chances of injury,'' said Judith Siegel, associate professor at the
UCLA School of Public Health and the study's main investigator.
   Victims who fought back in the majority of cases did so after
they were harmed, which suggests the resistance itself was not
provocation, Ms. Siegel concluded.
   ``When the assailant is using verbal pressure, it looks in a
number of cases like the victim can talk their way out of it,'' Ms.
Siegel said.
   The new study contradicts earlier research concluding that
resistance goads the attacker into further violence.
   Sociologists have debated for years whether resistance is more
likely to save a victim's life or provoke a more violent attack, but
no consensus has been reached.
   Ms. Siegel's researchers surveyed 3,132 men and women nationwide.
Of those surveyed, 365 had been sexually assaulted or were victims
of an attempted assault.
   Five percent of the victims were younger than 16 years old.
   More than one-third said they responded by talking or reasoning,
telling their assailants, ``You won't go to heaven,'' ``I'm not
interested in you,'' or ``I'll tell your wife,'' Ms. Siegel said.
   About one-fourth of those surveyed didn't resist, and slightly
less than a quarter fought back physically. Four percent responded
with loud and angry talking and 8 percent told the attacker they had
no sexual interest in him.
   The study showed that children were the least likely to fight
back.
   ``Children may be more trusting of others and less able to
distinguish at onset an act of affection from an attempt at sexual
contact,'' the study said. ``Further, children are socialized to be
deferent and obedient, particularly to those in positions of
authority or power.''

<HEAD>Central Bank Devalues Shekel 5 Percent Against Dollar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's central bank today announced a 5
percent devaluation of the shekel in hopes of stemming a wave of
panic buying of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies.
   Rumors over the last few weeks that the shekel would be devalued
by as much as 15 percent provoked many Israelis to buy foreign
currency, hoping to sell later at a better rate.
   The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange halted trading early today to give
the markets time to adjust to the announcement, Israel army radio
said.
   Bank of Israel spokesman Gideon Schurr said the devaluation meant
the U.S. dollar would now buy 1.68 shekels, compared with 1.599 at
the previous rate fixed by the government. The Bank of Israel is the
nation's central bank.
   Schurr said the bank's move was ``in response to renewed
purchases of foreign currency by the public in recent days, which
were particularly high today.''
   He declined to give figures, but Israel radio said Israelis have
been buying as much as $70 million in foreign currency.
   A devaluation had not been anticipated until after the first of
the year. Economists said further devaluations still were likely, in
part to stimulate flagging exports.
   Industries have been calling for a devaluation to ease a squeeze
on profits caused by rising production costs and static income from
sales abroad. The last devaluation was 10 percent against the dollar
in January 1987.
   Shimon Peres, finance minister in the new government formed last
week, has said devaluation would not help the economy unless
government spending also was cut.

<HEAD>Company Documents Reveal Agent Orange Producer Warned Of Hazards

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A manufacturer of Agent Orange and other
dioxin-tainted herbicides knew of dangers to its workers for 12
years, but rejected safety modifications because they could have
hurt productivity, documents show.
   The Diamond Alkali Co., whose plant here produced the herbicides
between 1951 and 1969, received a series of memos in 1957 from C.H.
Boehringer Sohn, a West German chemical manufacturer, warning of the
dangers of a nameless byproduct of the manufacture of certain
herbicides.
   The byproduct eventually became known as dioxin and has been
linked to skin diseases, liver damage, birth defects and some forms
of cancer.
   The memos were among confidential company documents provided to
The Associated Press by an attorney, who acted on condition of
anonymity, involved in litigation over the herbicides.
   Company officials referred questions to attorney George McCarter
of Newark, who said in a telephone interview that he and the company
could not comment because of a pending lawsuit.
   In 1967, Diamond Alkali merged with the Texas-based Shamrock Oil
and Gas Co. to form the Diamond Shamrock Corp., which has its
headquarters in Dallas. The New Jersey plant was closed in 1969.
   Boehringer sent the memos to its competitors around the world
after the West German company learned the hard way: A 1953 explosion
at its Hamburg plant exposed 37 workers to the herbicide 2-4-5-T,
and many of them developed a severe skin condition known as
chloracne and eventually suffered liver damage.
   The West German company, worried about the long-term effects of
the contamination, tore the plant down and redesigned its production
process to virtually eliminate dioxin. It offered to help its
competitors, including Diamond Alkali, to do the same.
   After a 1960 explosion at its plant, Diamond Alkali rebuilt it
with little change in design, despite plant manager John Burton's
recommendation that some of Boehringer's methods be adopted, the
memos show.
   David J. Porter, a Diamond Alkali researcher who acted as a
liaison with the West Germans, seemed to be impressed with the West
Germans' methods, according to an internal company memo dated Sept.
18, 1957.
   ``In view of our problems with chloracne problems in our plant,
it would certainly seem in order to check these observations, if
possible, in trial plant runs,'' Porter wrote.
   But in papers filed with Essex County Judge Leo Yanoff, who is
hearing the lawsuit against Diamond Shamrock, company researcher
T.W. Fraser Russell questioned the feasibility of the West Germans'
ideas.
   ``Those suggestions, specifically concerning temperature and
dilution, would have resulted in a far less productive and
significantly less economic operation of the plant,'' he said.
   The documents are expected to figure in a lawsuit pending in
Essex County Superior Court on behalf of 21 former workers at
Diamond Alkali's plant, their relatives and some long-time residents
of Newark's Ironbound neighborhood, the site of the plant.
   The lawsuit charges that the company fradulently withheld
information about the dangers of dioxin from the employees and the
government.
   State environmental officials in 1983 called the neighborhood one
of the worst dioxin contamination sites in the nation and ordered a
$16 million cleanup.
   ``It is clear that contrary to current beliefs, Diamond Shamrock
knew in the late 1950s that its process for producing herbicides
exposed workers to great risk and could have been altered,'' said
plaintiffs' attorney Michael Gordon.

<HEAD>Poor Weather Hampers Bush Quail Hunt</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: TOP 6 grafs new to UPDATE with details from Hart; 4th graf,
Joining Bush.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush remained secluded
today at an isolated ranch but he and his friends were not
optimistic about their quail hunting prospects because of poor
weather conditions, his spokesman said.
   Steve Hart said Bush, armed with a shotgun, managed to kill some
birds on the first day of his vacation at the Lazy F ranch on
Monday. ``He didn't strike out,'' Hart said.
   But today Bush was not optimistic about bagging any quail because
of the gusting winds and overcast skies that threatened rain, he
said.
   Nonetheless, Hart said the party set out on their morning hunt.
   Bush, an avid outdoorsman who says he loves shooting birds,
planned no public appearances while at the 10,000-acre ranch about
70 miles north of Corpus Christi and 15 miles from this rural town
of 15,000 people.
   Hart said Bush viewed his time at the ranch, owned by Houston
millionaire Will Farish, as a chance to relax away from the daily
pressures of the nation's capital.
   Joining Bush on the hunting trip, an annual event for the last 20
years, were Bush's brother, Jonathan, James A. Baker III, the
designated secretary of state, and Farish. Also staying at the
simple, one-story ranch house were Farish's wife, Sarah, and Baker's
wife, Susan.
   The Bushes, Bakers and Farishes have a bond that goes back to the
days when they all lived in Houston, where Bush was in the oil
business.
   Mrs. Bush remained in Washington to pack up the vice president's
house in preparation for the move to the White House next month.
   Bush's schedule for the next two days will involve rising early
to stalk quail and then returning for lunch, Hart said. Bush
probably will take a nap in the afternoon, do a bit more hunting and
then retire early, probably about 8 p.m.
   Though Bush described himself as a ``fairly good'' shot,
quail-hunting conditions were less than ideal on Monday, the day he
flew into Chase Naval Air Station.
   Locals said the 70-degree temperature was too warm and the bird
population was devastated by the summer drought.
   Bush said he was not squeamish about shooting birds, even though
he doubted he would kill deer. Discussing birds, he said, ``Our
forefathers ate by harvesting game.''
   Work was not a high priority during the holiday, even though Bush
said he brought along ``a little homework, a little inaugural
background material, a little reading,'' primarily on the budget.
   Before he was driven to the hideaway in the scrub brush, Bush,
wearing his pants tucked into his cowboy boots, told reporters that
he had talked by telephone to his son, Jeb Bush, who was flying back
from a quick visit to Soviet Armenia, scene of a devastating
earthquake.
   Jeb, a Miami real estate developer, and his son, George, 12, flew
into Armenia on Christmas Day to deliver toys and medical supplies
to children.
   Bush said his son told him the trip was probably ``the most
moving thing he has ever been involved in.''
   On another matter, the president-elect also said he supported
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's overtures to meet Israeli leaders
in Israel.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir also welcomed a Mubarak
visit as a way of moving towards peace in the Middle East.
   ``The more contact they have ... the better it is,'' Bush said.
Asked if he would visit the Middle East to encourage peace, Bush
replied: ``If I thought it would further the peace process, I would
get on that plane right now and go.''
   But he quickly added he is not the president yet, and such
diplomatic events require planning and policy reviews.
   Bush, who has named his Cabinet secretaries except for energy,
said he would have no announcement until Friday at the earliest. He
also is looking for a drug czar.
   On Thursday, Bush flies to Pintlalla, Ala., for a few hours of
bass fishing with Ray Scott, a friend who founded Bass Masters. He
returns to Washington that night.

   Troops shot and wounded 16 Palestinans today in
clashes in the occupied lands, including a teen-ager who was in
critical condition with a bullet wound in the left eye, Arab
hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed two people were wounded in clashes and said it
was checking other reports.
   In Jerusalem's crowded business and shopping district, a small
bomb exploded in a garbage can. There were no injuries or damages.
   ``This is definitely a terrorist attack,'' said police spokesman
Rafi Levy. He said he based the judgment on the timing of the
explosion and its location in the heart of Jewish west Jerusalem.
   The worst clashes today occurred in the Nusseirat refugee camp, a
shantytown of 29,000 people in the occupied Gaza Strip, according to
Arab witnesses and officials at Shifa and Ahli Arab hospitals in
Gaza City.
   Hundreds of residents poured into the camp's narrow alleys to
protest the shooting of two teen-agers by troops earlier today.
Soldiers responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and then plastic
bullets, witnesses said.
   Six more youths were wounded, including one with bullets in his
chest and face, hospital officials said.
   In the West Bank's Balata refugee camp, 16-year-old Mahmoud Saqer
was in critical condition after being struck with a bullet in the
left eye, said officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital.
   Seven teen-agers were wounded in clashes elsewhere, including a
15-year-old from Gaza's Khan Yunis refugee camp who was in serious
condition with a bullet wound in the genitals.
   Palestinians have been protesting Israeli rule in the West Bank
and Gaza, captured by Israel in 1967, for the last year. At least
336 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died since the uprising began
Dec. 8, 1987.
   The explosion today in Jerusalem occurred at about 9:35 a.m. at
the central intersection of Jaffa Road and King George Street. At
the time, the area was crowded with shoppers.
   The bomb, planted inside a garbage can, blew the lid off but left
the bin in place. Police blocked off Jaffa Road for half an hour as
explosives experts examined the site.
   Police rounded up 13 Arabs for questioning, Levy said.
   The trash can, reinforced with steel lining, was one of several
introduced in downtown Jerusalem in recent months to withstand bomb
blasts. For several years, Jerusalem had no public trash cans
because they were frequently used to plant bombs.
   Also today, soldiers uproooted olive trees lining a highway near
Shaarei Tikva, an agricultural West Bank Jewish settlement about 15
miles northeast of Tel Aviv, Israel radio said. The army also
imposed a curfew on the nearby Arab village of Beit Amin.
   The moves came after two firebombs were thrown inside a house in
Shaarei Tikva on Monday night, the report said. The bombs caused no
injuries or damage.
   The army frequently destroys olive and citrus trees to remove
cover used by stone-throwers.

   Snow, sleet and freezing rain stretching from the Rockies and
upper Plains to Ohio stymied holiday travelers in choked airports
and on snarled, icy highways, causing at least 10 traffic deaths.
   At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, the nation's busiest,
only two runways were open Monday and United Airlines, O'Hare's
heaviest user, canceled most outbound flights after 5 p.m. and an
additional 165 flights this morning.
   Nearly 50,000 passengers were stranded at O'Hare on the day after
Christmas, one of the busiest travel days of the year.
   Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport was closed for two
hours Monday so crews could clear snow off runways. About 25 flights
were delayed, airport spokeswoman Patricia Rowe said.
   Warmer air moved into some areas today, but cold air dominated
the northern and central Intermountain area. Ely, Nev., registered
20 degrees below zero and had a wind-chill reading of 55 below zero
this morning.
   The early winter storm Monday dropped up to a foot of snow,
closing interstates in five states.
   ``I was stuck last year on Christmas Eve at the airport, so I
thought this year I'd take the bus. Wrong!'' said Jan Gabrielson of
Cincinnati, who spent several hours at Chicago's Greyhound bus
terminal while returning from a Christmas trip to Iowa.
   In Utah, the heavy snow caused the collapse of a department store
roof south of Salt Lake City. No injuries were reported, since
managers of the Fred Meyer store denied entry to customers when they
arrived Monday morning and found the roof sagging and creaking from
6-foot-high snow drifts. It collapsed soon afterward.
   ``Luckily they didn't open the store or we would have had a major
catastrophe,'' said Salt Lake County Fire Department Capt. Max Berry.
   In Indiana, the winter weather caused a tractor-trailer to
jackknife on Interstate 69, triggering a 42-car pileup that left one
person dead and 23 injured. An unrelated 35-car pileup on the
highway injured eight people.
   Altogether, five people died in Indiana traffic accidents blamed
on the storm. Also Monday, Illinois and Minnesota each reported one
storm-related traffic death. Three people died on roads in Wisconsin.
   Farmers welcomed the storm in North Dakota, which like much of
the region had suffered a severe drought. Up to 11 inches fell on
parts of the state.
   ``It's good news,'' said wheat farmer Peter Silbernagel of
Linton, N.D. ``It greatly improves the outlook for spring planting.''
   The snow dissipated today as warmer air brought showers and
thunderstorms to parts of the central Plains and Mississippi Valley,
said Dan McCarthy, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``The main storm system is going to move slowly off into Ontario
today, with some lingering snow across Minnesota,'' McCarthy said.
   Nonetheless, temperatures early today were in the single digits
and below zero from the northern Plains through the northern
Rockies, and some winter storm warnings continued this morning.
   Northerly winds increasing to 20 to 35 mph there were expected to
create dangerous wind chills of minus 50.
   On Monday, snow and freezing rain fell from the Rockies and upper
Plains to Ohio. Accidents and blowing snow closed segments of
interstate highways in Utah, Minnesota, Indiana, Arizona and South
Dakota. The highest accumulations were 12 inches around Chicago and
in Bemidji, Minn.
   In South Dakota, which received up to 10 inches of snow, the
storm knocked out power to about 55,000 customers of Northern States
Power Co. on Monday afternoon when high winds caused icy power lines
to bang together and short-circuit, said John Lockhart, the
company's construction manager.
   In Durango, Colo., two men were hospitalized in good condition
Monday after being buried under snow for nearly seven hours. They
were rescued by passersby who heard their screams. The area was
under an avalanche warning.
   More than 100 slides were reported in Colorado's high country by
Monday, according to the Avalanche Information Center in Denver.

   Entertainer Marie Osmond, who reported a

she found the piece in a car after she left the theater, police said
today.
   Initially, the singer reported that her stole was taken from her
seat in the director's box during intermission while she and her
husband, Brian Blosil, attended a performance of ``The Nutcracker''
on Friday.
   However, police said Osmond later informed officers that she had
left the fur in a car and found it after she and husband left the

   A man accidentally shot his friend during a debate
over whether a gun could be knocked out of an assailant's hand
before the weapon could be fired, and then killed himself, police
said.
   After Tim Rhea, 19, was accidentally shot, Jerry Apodaca, 21,
telephoned for emergency assistance and spoke to a dispatcher before
he turned the .45-caliber automatic pistol on himself, police said.
   Rhea was pronounced dead early Monday at Baylor University
Medical Center in Dallas.
   Apodoca and Rhea, who had been friends since childhood, ``were
talking about whether you could kick a gun out of somebody's hand
before they had time to shoot,'' said homicide detective Robert
McLeod.
   Police said Apodaca had brought the pistol to a party at his
parents' downtown shoe repair shop. Rhea, who had studied karate,
apparently kicked at the gun ``but it was not an angry-type thing:
they were just playing,'' said homicide Sgt. Jerry King.
   Authorities said the gun accidentally discharged and a bullet
struck Rhea in the side. Two other men and a woman at the party told
police that Apodaca dialed 911 for help for Rhea and then shot
himself.
   Rhea's father, Earl Rhea, said his son and Apodaca had a
friendship ``just about as close as you can be with a friend.''
   ``They never had any problems,'' said the elder Rhea, describing
the shooting as ``just a freak accident.''

   Two of three inmates who escaped from a
county jail on Christmas with help from a sympathetic guard have
been recaptured, and the guard has been fired, the sheriff said.
   ``He just became overly friendly with them,'' Quay County Sheriff
Philip Snedeker said Monday. ``He was supposed to give them a
10-minute head start and then say they'd broken out on their own.''
   A third inmate, Charles W. Bray, 29, of Raleigh, N.C., remained
at large, and was believed to be heading toward the Oklahoma
Panhandle, Snedeker said.
   Snedeker said jailer Chris Quintana admitted unlocking one of two
doors to the jail's containment area and supplying the inmates with
a tire iron, which they used to force open a second lock.
   However, Snedeker said the inmates turned on Quintana and came at
him with the tire iron. Quintana locked himself in a containment
area and called for help as the prisoners fled, Snedeker said.
   Quintana has been fired but not arrested, the sheriff said. He
said he planned to meet with the district attorney to discuss
possible charges.

   West Germany plans elaborate ceremonies
marking the Federal Republic's 40th anniversary next year.
   Horst Waffenschmidt, parliamentary undersecretary in the Interior
Ministry, said the government will stage exhibits and other projects
marking the founding of West Germany that will cost an estimated
$13.7 million.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl will kick off the ceremonies by opening an
exhibition at Bonn's Academic Center on Feb. 16, Waffenschmidt said.
   Starting in April, the exhibition will be displayed successively
in West Berlin, Mainz, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Munich, Wiesbaden and
Kiel.
   From February through September, 180 separate ceremonies are
planned, Waffenschmidt said, with the main ceremony set for May 24
when President Richard von Weizsaecker will speak in Bonn.
   West Germany's Basic Law establishing the new republic was
proclaimed on May 23, 1949, and went into effect one day later.
   The country's first democratic parliamentary election was held on
Aug. 14, 1949, and Konrad Adenauer became West Germany's first
chancellor on Sept. 15, 1949.

   Customs officials in the southern city of Canton
have foiled an attempt to smuggle a priceless collection of nearly
1,000 relics out of China, it was reported Tuesday.
   The pieces were discovered in the past month concealed in flower
vases, jewelry boxes and other items, the newspapers Wen Wei Po and
Ta Kung Pao reported.
   The reports did not give a total value for the relics, which
included porcelain, ivory work and ancient books, but claimed it was
one of the largest smuggling cases since the Communists came to
power in 1949.
   Some of the relics dated from the Sung Dynasty, 960-1279.
   Two Hong Kong residents and two Taiwanese businessmen bought the
relics on the black market, the reports said.
   Officials in Canton, about 90 miles northwest of Hong Kong, found
the customs declaration suspicious, the reports said. Five Chinese
have been detained in the case, Wen Wei Po said.

<HEAD>Line-Item Veto Has Long Way to Go in Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he takes office next month, George Bush
will become at least the 13th president to ask Congress to give him
the power of line-item veto.
   Odds are, he will get the same answer: No.
   Even supporters of the idea concede that allowing presidents to
veto individual items in spending legislation _ as opposed to
accepting or rejecting the entire bill _ is an idea whose time
simply has not come.
   ``The odds are it's going to be very tough,'' says Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, who took Bush's Houston congressional seat in 1970
and has been introducing legislation to establish the line-item veto
for years.
   President Grant was the first to ask Congress for the power in
1873, and President Reagan has asked for it repeatedly, calling it
``a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending.''
   Says Archer, ``More and more, we're packaging together big
spending bills. A lot of items in them don't make good sense, and
the president is faced with having to veto or sign the entire
package.''
   In the 100th Congress that adjourned in October, 16 separate
measures were introduced that would give line-item veto power to the
president. All of them died in committee.
   The reasons are largely institutional and political. Most
legislators do not want presidents to intrude on Congress' spending
authority. And with Democrats controlling the House and Senate and a
Republican in the White House, the desire to let a president snip
pieces out of legislation is even more underwhelming.
   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, a member of the House Budget
Committee, says Reagan's efforts to win line-item veto are a ``smoke
screen'' used to cloud the administration's inability to solve the
federal deficit problem. Democrats oppose the idea ``virtually
unanimously,'' he said.
   Says incoming House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.: ``I
don't think we ought to play with the constitutional balance that
was set by our forefathers. I think we ought to try to make the
system work the way they designed it to.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee, has supported line-item veto proposals in the
past, but says he only expects to see one enacted if it is
temporary, limited and part of some overall budget deal.
   ``I don't think it's going anywhere,'' he admits.
   Many observers believe that even if such a change were approved _
and it would probably take a constitutional amendment _ Congress
could easily get around it.
   ``Congress could simply redefine what line items are,'' says
Carol Cox, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal
Budget, a bi-partisan group that monitors the budget process.

<HEAD>Disaster Lingers Over Shattered Scottish Town One Week Later</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   There was no warning, nowhere to run
for 11 townspeople believed caught in the fireball of a crashing Pan
Am jumbo jet. One week later there is still no escape in this
shattered town from the presence of disaster.
   The effort to find the dead, and to determine the cause,
stretches the length of the main street: from the police station,
past the tall spire of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church where
relatives come for a word of comfort, to the Town Hall, now a
temporary morgue.
   A turn to the right leads to Mounthoolie, the grass-covered hill
where more wreckage fell, and beyond lie the forests, bogs,
pastures, lochs and reservoirs where the search goes on.
   To the left, the street heads past the tall gravestones around
the Church of Scotland church and on to the ice rink, also pressed
into use as a morgue. Across the road, the modern brick buildings of
Lockerbie Academy have been taken over by rescue workers and by
counselors assigned to help relatives of victims.
   The churches and most of the homes and cottages in Lockerbie are
built of solemn brown stone that gives this market town and former
rail center the look of a sepia print from late Victorian times.
   As the flowers at the Town Hall begin to wilt, the town is left
to wonder why its Christmas was filled with death.
   ``Confronted with the horror of such loss we feel empty, hurt,
confused,'' the Rev. Patrick Keegans said at a Requiem Mass Monday
night.
   ``As Christ did on the cross, we too scream at the Father, `My
God, My God, why have you abandoned me?' He does not seem to answer.
There is only silence.''
   The British investigative team has confirmed two possible causes
are being examined: an explosion in flight, or structural failure.
   One suitcase and an unspecified amount of wreckage have been sent
to the Royal Armament Research and Development Esablishment at Fort
Halstead in southern England ``to determine whether they exhibit
evidence of a pre-impact explosion,'' said chief investigator
Michael Charles.
   A day after the crash, U.S. officials said the embassy in
Helsinki, Finland, had received a threat on Dec. 5 against Pan Am
service between Frankfurt, West Germany, and the United States.
Those threats were thought to be related to the Abu Nidal group of
Palestinian radicals.
   Finnish authorities said they knew who made the call, and said he
had not been out of the country since Dec. 5.
   Others claimed responsibility after the crash, including one man
who telephoned The Associated Press in London anonymously to say
Iranians had done it in revenge for the domestic airliner shot down
by the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf in July.
   Pan Am Flight 103 began Dec. 21 in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727
with 115 passengers aboard, of whom 70 got off in London; In London,
45 changed to the Boeing 747 to carry on to New York and 198 more
passengers and a new crew joined the flight.
   The change of planes at London's Heathrow International Airport
took 65 minutes _ 25 minutes beyond the scheduled departure time of
6 p.m. It left London with 243 passengers, 13 cabin attendants and a
cockpit crew of three.
   As the 18-year-old Clipper Maid of the Sea reached a cruising
altitude of 31,000 feet, it broke up and disappeared from radar at
7:19 p.m. The cockpit voice recorder ends with a muffled noise, and
no indication the crew detected anything amiss. Investigation of the
noise continues.
   In Lockerbie, the wreckage threw up a towering fireball _
witnesses thought it might have been 300 feet _ close by the
southbound lanes of the A74 highway linking western England and
Glasgow.

   Four houses in the adjacent Sherwood Crescent were obliterated as
the wreckage plowed a furrow 100 feet long and 20 feet deep in the
sticky red clay. At least 20 homes were set ablaze and scores more
suffered gashes in roofs and shattered glass as pieces of the
aircraft were reduced to shrapnel.
   The crew of a British Airways Boeing 757 flying at 22,000 feet
saw the flash on the ground and reported it to controllers.
   Mangled seats and debris showered the houses along Rosebank
Cresent, across the railroad tracks, and one engine slammed on
Alexandra Drive, all along the south side of the town.
   Bodies were scattered in the grass of Mounthoolie, a 150-foot
high hill east of town.
   Many injuries were expected, but only five people were taken to a
hospital on the night of the crash. Two were released immediately.
   The cockpit fell three miles east of Lockerbie, just beyond the
stone wall of a country church at Tundergarth Mains.
   Subsequently, the main search area extended 15 miles east of
Lockerbie to the Esk River, and mail and other lightweight debris
apparently from the jet was found as far as 70 miles away.
   The wide trail of debris left no doubt the jet had broken apart
in the air.
   The crash brought a rescue force which grew to 1,500 people,
including about 600 searchers on the ground. It also brought Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Prince Andrew, U.S. Ambassador Charles
H. Price II and scores of journalists to Lockerbie, a town of 2,500
people with three telephone booths.
   On Wednesday, the Royal Air Force's 60-foot-long ``Queen
Elizabeth'' trucks designed to carry aircraft wreckage backed up
traffic as they threaded the hairpin turn past the World War I
memorial on their way to a temporary storage depot.
   West German investigators looked at baggage handling in
Frankfurt. When asked if a bomb may have slipped through airport
security checks, state Economics Ministry spokesman Thomas Pier
said: ``The Frankfurt prosecutor's investigation, which concerns
airport security checks of passengers and hand-carried bags, so far
rules that out.''
   Scotland Yard said Tuesday that its inquiry at Heathrow is
continuing, led by the commander of its anti-terrorist squad, George
Churchill-Coleman.
   The disaster was reminiscent of the crash of an Air India Boeing
747 off Ireland on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 aboard. There was
no distress signal, no exclamation of alarm on the cockpit voice
recorder as the plane broke up, also at 31,000 feet.
   Investigators found no trace of a bomb in three tons of debris
and 131 bodies recovered from 6,000 feet of water. A coroner's jury
convened in Cork, Ireland, concluded only that the disaster resulted
from a ``sudden catastrophe ... the nature and origin of which
remains uncertain.''
   However, an Indian judicial inquiry concluded in March 1986 that
a suitcase bomb had been put aboard in Canada, and Indian
authorities said they suspected militant Sikh separatists. It took
22 months for Japanese investigators to conclude that structral
failure was at fault in a Boeing 747 crash that killed 520 people,
the worst single-plane accident ever, in 1985.

   Scientists are developing a system of Braille

on the road, a laboratory said Tuesday.
   The blind will ``read'' by treading blister-type surfaces that
will indicate lampposts, roads signs, trash cans, platform edges at
train stations, as well as where to cross roads, according to the
Transport and Road Research Laboratory in Crowthorne.
   The laboratory is testing patterns that can be distinguished
without confusing or inconveniencing others, especially those with
walking difficulties or in wheelchairs, said Press Association, the

   Braille, a system of lettering using embossed dots that can be
felt through the finger tips, was invented by Frenchman Louis

   The rate set earlier this month was 2,800 dong to one dollar.
   Vietnamese officials have said a more realistic rate against the

<TEXT>
   Communist China's first officially approved movie
with sex scenes has been screened to sell-out crowds in Canton, the
China News Service said Tuesday.
   ``Widows' Village'' is about the experiences of three young
couples in a fishing village before and after the communist victory
in 1949. The film's director has recommended that children not watch
it, the official report said.
   It said the movie ``required some special scenes showing couples'
lovemaking,'' but didn't elaborate on how graphic the scenes were or
why they were necessary to the plot. It said the story dealt with
the couples' experiences ``under the influence of strange marriage
customs,'' but gave no details.
   ``It didn't show anything too revealing,'' the report quoted one
viewer as saying. ``It could be considered an artistic movie that
exposes the damage done to sex by feudal thinking.''
   China has been undergoing one of its most open and creative
periods in moviemaking and other arts since the communist takeover.
The overall trend has been toward greater openness in content and
experimentation in style, but there also are periodic attacks on
works considered too liberal.
   Two weeks ago, censors who have the power to ban movies held
their first open session ever, and approved a movie in which the
hero commits suicide. Beijing also opened its first exhibit of nude
paintings last week.
   On the other hand, authorities recently have held book burnings
in several cities, destroying Chinese books considered pornographic
and illegal translations of books by American authors Irving Wallace
and Jacqueline Susann, known for their steamy novels.
   The China News Service said ``Widows' Village'' opened Saturday
in major theaters in the southern city of Canton after a one-day
preview that was sold out. The film was made jointly by the Pearl
River Movie Studio of Canton and the Hong Kong Silver City
Organization.
   China has no formal movie rating system, although one has been
proposed. The report quoted the director, Wang Jin, as saying the
contents were not suitable for children. Few viewers brought their
children, it said.
   China under communism has been generally prudish about sex and
scornful of sometimes graphic Western movies and books as
encouraging crime and moral degeneration.
   The censors recently have allowed greater frankness, however.
   The 1987 movie ``The Old Well,'' which won international awards,
depicted a love triangle and contained a passionate kissing scene.
This year's ``Red Sorghum,'' which won an award at the West Berlin
International Film Festival, showed a woman being carried off with
the implication that she was raped, but contained nothing explicit.
It also showed a man urinating into a jug of wine.
   The Ministry of Culture is drafting a law that would define what
is permissible in art, and says this will free artists from the
whims of individual censors. Many artists fear it also could freeze
experimentation and liberalization.
   Although ``Widows' Village'' is the first Chinese film approved
by communist officials that contains sex scenes, it won't be the
first time some Chinese viewers have seen such scenes.
   Foreign videos, many pirated, circulate widely in China's cities
on a private basis.
   Chinese TV also has shown some Western programs with love scenes
that are more daring than what previously was allowed in the theater.

<HEAD>Takeshita Reshuffles Cabinet In Effort To Restore Public Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, seeking to erase
the shadow of a stock scandal that tainted his government,
reshuffled the Cabinet on Tuesday with an aggressive new justice
minister at the forefront.
   The 20-member Cabinet does not include any politicians linked to
the so-called Recruit scandal, which led to the resignation of the
finance minister and 16 other influential politicians and business
leaders.
   The scandal and the passage last week of a tax reform package
that includes a 3 percent sales tax have hurt the popularity of
Takeshita's government.
   There were changes in four ministries touched by the scandal,
even though the ministers themselves were not accused of personal
involvement.
   Takeshita left in place his foreign minister, his chief Cabinet
secretary and two top leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party who
are strong contenders to succeed him as prime minister.
   The chief secretary, Keizo Obuchi, said the changes were in
keeping with Takeshita's promises to tighten political discipline.
   Seen as a key to these efforts is the new justice minister,
Takashi Hasegawa, 76, who heads a parliamentary committee on
political ethics.
   ``I am aware that the public is losing confidence in politicians,
business leaders and public officials,'' Hasegawa said in a news
conference following his appointment. ``It is a serious matter to
rectify it. For Japan to be trusted in the international arena, we
have to start with establishing a trustworthy political system.''
   In the scandal, a number of influential politicans and business
leaders profited from bargain purchases of unlisted stock shares
that rose sharply in price after their public offering.
   While not illegal, the transactions in shares of Recruit-Cosmos,
a real estate company, have been viewed as unethical donations.
   Apart from the new Justice Ministry appointment, analysts said
they expected no significant changes in government policies with the
new Cabinet.
   Besides Obuchi, others who kept their positions were Foreign
Minister Sousuke Uno, Defense Agency Director-General Kichiro
Tazawa, and Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama, who was appointed
Saturday.
   Murayama replaced Kiichi Miyazawa, who quit to take
responsibility for an aide's involvement in the scandal.
   Two contenders to succeed Takeshita retained key party posts _
Shintaro Abe as secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party,
and Michio Watanabe as party policy chief.
   Also keeping his post was Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the party's
Executive Council.
   It is customary for prime ministers to rotate senior party
members through ministerial posts without changing the power balance
among major factions, and the new Cabinet reflects this.
   Takeshita's own faction has six portfolios, while those of Abe,
Miyazawa and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone have four each
and that of senior politician Toshio Komoto has two.
   ``In a word, I have a feeling of stability,'' Takeshita said
after announcing the changes. ``I'm looking forward to them all
working hard.''
   A poll this month by the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun showed the
Takeshita administration had only 18 percent support, down from 30
percent when the prime minister took office 13 months ago.
   But Tokyo University political scientist Takashi Inoguchi said,
``Takeshita may be on a temporary low, but by next summer he will be
shining again.''
   Inoguchi suggested that Takeshita can boost his popularity by
faring well in a meeting next month with President-elect George Bush
and possibly holding a summit Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``An annual reshuffle of Cabinet posts is a firmly established
custom in Japan,'' said Seizaburo Sato, a professor of political
science at Tokyo University. ``Takeshita doesn't want to upset the
status quo.''

   A crush on a pretty girl first led Robert Runcie to
the Anglican Church, the archbishop of Canterbury says.
   ``A friend of mine at school and I were both keen on the same
girl who went to the local school,'' said Runcie, the spiritual head
of the Church of England and of Anglicans worldwide.
   ``So when we heard that she was going to confirmation classes we
thought we would go along, too. And I have to say that was how it
all started.''
   Runcie told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio interview
to be broadcast Sunday that the girl named Betty ``didn't
subsequently figure in my life at all, but she was the unknown agent
of my being led into the way of religious orthodoxy.''
   Runcie married his wife, Angela, in 1957.

   Veteran Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa plans to
make a film next year that will be a series of nine stories based on
his own life.
   The film, tentatively titled ``Dreams,'' will be distributed
worldwide by Warner Bros. and director Steven Spielberg's film
company, Amblin Entertainment, the 78-year-old director told a news
conference Tuesday.
   ``Dreams'' will be Kurosawa's first movie since ``Ran,'' released
almost four years ago. Its cost is estimated at $12 million.
   ``I had the idea two years ago, when I was exhausted after
finishing `Ran,''' Kurosawa said. ``I was playing golf and such.
Suddenly I had an urge to write, and I finished the screenplay
almost immediately.''
   Kurosawa was reluctant to describe the film, which begins
shooting next month, but said one of the episodes, ``Village of the
Watermills,'' will be about ``quiet farm life.''
   ``I once dreamed of entering a van Gogh painting and meeting the
artist. That has now been achieved in one of the stories,'' he said
   Kurosawa gained worldwide prominence with his 1950 ``Rashomon''
and 1954 ``Seven Samurai,'' but he has been better known in recent
years for his grand spectacles ``Kagemusha'' and ``Ran.''

   It's Jimmy Stewart's voice all right, that
unmistakable folksy twang urging the speaker's teen-age
granddaughter to eat Campbell's soup.
   The commercial is the second of Stewart's long acting career,
which includes an Academy Award for ``The Philadelphia Story'' and
Oscar-nominated roles in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,''``It's a
Wonderful Life'' and ``Harvey.''
   The first commercial the 80-year-old actor did was a spot for
Firestone tires which ran about 10 years ago.
   ``He did it as a favor for Leonard Firestone (then president of
Firestone of California), who had donated a library to Princeton,
where (Stewart) went to school,'' said John Strauss, the actor's
publicity agent.
   The idea of a voice-over for Campbell's ``tickled'' Stewart, said
Strauss.
   The spot with the teen-age granddaughter, who returns home after
a disastrous date, is one of five in a series. It began running in
Los Angeles in September. In another spot, Stewart persuades a
grandson not to run away, by offering him warm soup.
   The company says the hand seen stirring the soup is not
Stewart's. It's a stand-in's.
   ``If we had Stewart on camera, we thought it would be less
effective,'' said Roger Mosconi, senior vice president and creative
director of BBDO Advertising of New York. ``There's something
intriguing about hearing a well-known voice.''

   Comedian Cheech Marin is attracting a younger
audience than usual with his latest film.
   Marin provided the raucous voice for Tito, the hyperactive
Chihuahua, in the Disney animated film ``Oliver & Company.''
   ``Doing Tito was like recording a comedy album _ I went into the
studio and did the voice, which I really enjoyed,'' Marin said. ``I
always read the lines by myself _ I was never in the studio with
Bette Midler or Billy Joel. The character kind of developed in the
recording sessions: His romance with Georgette emerged late in the
production.''
   Tito is a lively character constantly in motion, hot wiring
electronic equipment and flirting with Georgette, the snooty poodle.
   ``I was encouraged to ad-lib, but I'd say I just gave about 75
percent of the lines as they were written,'' Marin said. ``The
natural energy of a Chihuahua played right into that feeling.''
   Tito's popularity has sparked rumors the character may appear in
another film, an idea that pleases Marin.
   ``I love animation _ I've always considered it an idealized form
of film making,'' he said. ``And I really dig the Tito character.''

   The more things Helen Buell loses, the more
she finds faith in human nature.
   In the past few weeks, the retired library clerk has lost her
purse twice, her wallet and a heirloom earring, and in each case the
people who found them returned the items.
   Buell first lost her wallet in a grocery store parking lot in
November, but a woman found it and returned it intact.
   A couple of weeks later, she left her purse in a shopping cart
basket at another supermarket, and again someone returned it.
   Then, Mrs. Buell realized after lunch in a local restaurant that
she was missing a century-old Christmas bell earring made of coral
that had been her mother's. It, too, was returned.
   Finally, she was shopping at a department store Friday and heard
her name over the loudspeaker. Mrs. Buell had left her purse in the
shoe department and someone had turned it in.
   The retired library cerk says she's grateful four different
people were honest with her.
   As for her sudden rash of losing things, she said, ``I'm going to
carry my purse around my neck.''

   One of the first stops a man made on
his recovery from drug addiction was a church _ to return a Nativity
scene he stole three years ago.
   The 17 creche figures worth about $300 were wrapped in newspapers
and placed on the doorstep of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Roman
Catholic Church shortly before Christmas, said the Rev. Michael
Braun.
   The man, who said he now is free of drugs, then telephoned Braun
to make certain the Nativity scene had been found.
   ``He said he is clean now, had found the Lord and was grief- and
conscience-stricken about taking the statues,'' Braun said.
   ``He was returning to the best of the season.''

   Chris Way and Hugh Holborn figured
they were on to something when customers at Way's seafood restaurant
began stealing bottles of his homemade hot sauce.
   Now, the partners appear to be well on their way to successfully
marketing ``Dat'l Do-it Hot Sauce,'' a liquid fire that Way
concocted two years ago, using a locally grown, vicious little
vegetable called the Datil pepper.
   The sauce, and a new product ``Hellish Relish,'' now are sold in
1,000 stores from Louisiana to North Carolina.
   ``It's a long, slow process, but little by little we're working
our way up against the big guys,'' Holborn said. Gearing up for that
challenge, they're learning such topics as product liability and
shelf-life testing.
   While Way and Holborn, both 32, hope to someday reign over the
hot sauce world, right now they are doing everything from paperwork
to grinding peppers that often leave them soaking their hands in
buckets of ice _ even after wearing two layers of thick gloves.
   ``These things react with water, too, so cleaning up afterwards
is like Chernobyl,'' Way said.
   Although the small green peppers are native to North Florida,
Holborn said no one really knows how they got here.
   ``I traced them back to the 1700s in Havana, so they must have
gotten here from some sort of Spanish influence,'' Holborn said.
   They are planning a third product, a Datil pepper jelly.
   ``We haven't picked a name yet. Maybe `Helly Jelly,''' Holborn
said.

<TEXT>
   Massimo Mila, a music historian who fought
against fascism in the 1930s, has died at the age of 78.
   Mila, who had suffered from diabetes, died of a heart attack
Monday.
   His life centered around his love for music and culture, his
political passions and mountain climbing.
   At 18, Mila joined a group of young Turin intellectuals opposed
to fascism. In 1929, he was arrested for a political demonstration
but released after several months.
   Mila volunteered as a courier for the resistance, and crossed the
Alps on foot to bring documents to Paris. In 1935, he was arrested
again and sentenced to seven years in prison.
   He studied German in prison, and later was a translator for the
Einaudi publishing house.
   He had his first major work published at the age of 23 _ his
graduation thesis on the melodrama of Giuseppe Verdi. He taught
music history for nearly 30 years at the University of Turin and the
Conservatory of Music.
   After the war, Mila was a music critic for the Communist Party
daily L'Unita. He later worked for the Turin-based daily La Stampa.
   He was the author of the books ``A Brief History of Music,''
``The Musical Experience and Aesthetics,'' ``The Art of Verdi,''
``Stravinsky Companion,'' and ``The Costumes of La Traviata.''

<HEAD>Home Sales Up 1.1 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes rose 1.1 percent in
November, the first advance since August, a real estate trade group
reported Tuesday.
   Analysts credited the rebound, in part, to the strong
participation of baby boomers in the housing market, saying their
numbers alone should help keep sales steady in 1989 despite
forecasts of higher mortgage rates.
   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.71 million
units in November, compared to an October sales pace of 3.67 million
units.
   Sales had shown no improvement at all in October after dropping
by 1.1 percent in September.
   Sales of new homes have been rising as well. In October, sales of
new single-family homes climbed to 733,000 units, the highest level
in 20 months. The government will report new home sales for November
on Friday.
   Analysts attributed the sales upswing in part to a growing number
of buyers in the marketplace.
   ``The fact is, the bulk of the baby boom is now being felt in
housing markets across the country,'' said John Tuccillo, chief
economist for the Realtors group. ``The strong pace of existing home
sales in November is more a tribute to the numbers of buyers out in
the market than it is to any particular short-term economic
conditions.''
   The November gain was the first increase since a 2.2 percent rise
last August.
   The price of an existing home edged down slightly to $87,900 in
November, compared to an October median price of $88,100.
   Tuccillo said he expected home sale prices nationally to increase
4.8 percent for all of 1988, about in line with the overall rise in
consumer prices. That would be down from a 6.6 percent price
increase recorded in 1987.
   The price moderation was attributed to a shift in sales from the
more expensive markets of the Northeast to the less expensive
markets in the Midwest.
   The Northeast remained the most expensive place to buy a home
with a median price of $142,500 in November, up 5.9 percent from a
year ago. The typical home in the West sold for $122,300 in
November, up 6 percent from a year ago.
   Homes in the South sold for $80,300 in November, an increase of
1.4 percent from a year earlier, while the Midwest remained the
least expensive housing area at $66,700, an increase of 3.6 percent
from a year ago.
   Many economists had been expecting a drop in sales of both new
and existing homes in 1989 because of rising mortgage rates. Last
week, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.68 percent and many
analysts are predicting they will hit 11.5 percent by spring.
   However, Tuccillo said the large number of adults in their 30s
and 40s who are looking for homes had prompted him to revise his
outlook for 1989 to show sales of around 3.38 million, down only 4.2
percent from an expected 3.53 million sales this year.
   In November, the sales increase was led by a 4.6 percent rise in
sales in the Northeast, which climbed to an annual rate of 680,000
units, up 3 percent from a year ago.
   Sales were up 4.3 percent in the Midwest, to an annual rate of
960,000 units. This is 7.9 percent above the sales rate a year ago
as this region continues to benefit from a boom in export sales by
manufacturing companies.
   Sales were unchanged in the South, at an annual rate of 1.40
million units but this was 11.1 percent higher than a year ago,
reflecting the fact that the region has begun to recover somewhat
from depressed conditions caused by a slump in the oil patch.
   The West was the only region of the country reporting a
month-to-month sales decline, a 7 percent setback, which left the
annual sales pace at 660,000 units, still nearly 18 percent higher
than a year ago.

   A passenger ship sank Tuesday in the
Dhaleswari River after being rammed by a cargo vessel, and reports
said 200 people were feared drowned.
   The United News of Bangladesh said about 60 people swam to safety
after an unidentified cargo vessel struck the rear of the passenger
ship Shasayal. The report said the passenger ship carried about 250
people.
   The crash occurred near Narayanganj, 10 miles south of Dhaka. The
Shasayal was headed for the capital from Faridpur district when it
went down, police said.
   Officials in Narayanganj confirmed the passenger ship sank in
more than 30 feet of water and said four bodies had been recovered.
They said they had no further details on casualties.
   The United News said angry onlookers attacked and ransacked the
cargo ship and beat up its crew members. The skipper of the vessel
was missing.
   Police in Narayanganj said the passenger ship had been hit from
behind. The police said they had seized the cargo vessel.
   Mohammad Ali, a survivor, was quoted as telling the Bengali daily
newspaper Ittefaq that out of nearly 300 passengers, between 60 to
70 swam to shore. There is no trace of the other passengers, the
paper said.
   Police said a salvage ship was en route to the scene.

   South Asian foreign ministers met
Tuesday to lay the groundwork for a seven-nation summit that will
bring new Pakistani leader Benazir Bhutto face-to-face for the first
time with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   Ms. Bhutto and Gandhi are the first leaders of the long
antagonistic neighbors not saddled with firsthand memories of the
bitter and bloody 1947 partition of British colonial India into two
nations: predominantly Hindu India and overwhelmingly Moslem
Pakistan. The two have fought three post-independence wars.
   The venue for Ms. Bhutto and Gandhi's first encounter is a
three-day summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation starting Thursday.
   Other members of the 3-year-old organization are Bangladesh,
Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
   Ms. Bhutto, who was sworn in as prime minister Dec. 2, is
expected to have three meetings with Gandhi, according to Pakistani
Foreign Secretary Humayun Khan.
   Foreign ministers of member states met Tuesday and will meet
again Wednesday. Pakistani Foreign Minister Yaqub Khan was elected
1989 chairman of the foreign ministers' council.
   He told Tuesday's session that members should work together to
improve social and economic conditions for their 1.1 billion people,
whose literacy rates range from 20 percent in Bhutan to 93 percent
in the Maldives.
   ``The nations of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation, where one-fifth of the world population lives ...
continue to face problems such as infant mortality, limited life
expectancy, high population growth, lack of adequate shelter and
absolute poverty,'' he said.
   Indian Foreign Minister Narasimha Rao called for tangible
results. ``What is needed is to emerge from the twilight of
hesitation into the confident dawn of full-fledged regional
cooperation,'' Rao said.
   The association does not deal with political or security issues.
This precludes it from taking up sensitive questions like the
Indian-Pakistani border dispute in Kashmir, a mountainous frontier
region where Pakistan occupies territory claimed by India.
   Instead, it tries to concentrate on trade, culture, health and
environment.
   Even the environment can be too hot to discuss on specific lines.
   Flood-prone Bangladesh, for example, would like the group to
draft a joint approach for disasters that beset the region with
deadly frequency. In Bangladesh's case, its perennially overflowing
rivers originate in the hills of India and Nepal. During the rainy
season, these rivers can broaden into an inland sea upon reaching
low-lying Bangladesh, where last summer's floods killed 1,500 people.
   India says anti-flood measures should be dealt with bilaterally.
   The association's most momentous agreements have been
diplomatically worded and non-specific pacts to cooperate in
suppressing terrorism, building food reserves and expressing concern
over the nuclear arms race.
   Members see their organization's strength in the forum it
provides to express their views and get to know each other better.
   ``This is not an organization that is given to dramatic
results,'' said Abul Ahsan of Bangladesh, secretary-general of the
organization.
   Notable achievements, he said, include direct-dial telephones and
air fare concessions among members nations.

<HEAD>Twin Cities Study: At Least 12 Percent Leave Bars Legally Drunk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 12 percent of the people leaving bars
in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area on any given day are legally drunk,
says a study based on researchers' observations of bar patrons'
behavior.
   ``What portion of the 12 percent are drivers is not yet known,''
said Richard Sykes, professor of speech communication at the
University of Minnesota and director of the survey. The National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism sponsored the study, and
James Schaefer, director of the university's Office of Alcohol &
Other Drug Abuse Prevention, served as a consultant.
   Teams of trained observers spent at least 10 hours in each of 65
bars in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, collecting data on the
behavior of 3,700 patrons drinking about 9,000 drinks.
   The observers, sipping ice water or soft drinks, focused on
selected patrons from the time they entered the bar until they left.
   ``The study disproved my theory, which was that people drink more
in groups than if they were alone,'' Sykes said.
   Among the study's findings:
   _Bar patrons consumed an average of 2.3 drinks a visit, whether
they were alone or in groups. The lone patrons, however, tended to
stay a shorter time and drink faster than those who are in groups.
   _A larger proportion of women than men were becoming legally
intoxicated. To the extent that women tried to keep up with the men
in their consumption rate, Sykes said, they were at greater risk
because of their smaller stature.
   _Women drank about as much as men in the bars, but they tended to
drink more slowly and stay longer.
   _Fewer than half of patrons were drinking in groups, contrary to
some expectations. And 95 percent of those who came in alone were
men.
   _Elderly males showed a tendency to drink heavily, often at
neighborhood bars in the morning.
   What didn't prove to be true was the stereotype of groups of
young men getting drunk, Sykes said. Instead, they found young and
old, men and women, becoming intoxicated.
   ``It's a rather complex picture,'' he said.
   The survey sampled a cross-section of about 12 percent of the 565
establishments that the researchers could identify as bars in the
metro area, Sykes said. The actual observations took place during
the first eight months of 1986, and Sykes continues to analyze the
data for various factors.
   ``Right now, we are working on the differences between bars,'' he
said.
   Richard Rowley, a university graduate student writing his
doctoral dissertation on the study, managed the research staff,
mainly undergraduate honors students and graduate students.
   Rowley began by attending bartending school, not only to know how
drinks were mixed and their alcohol content, but also to pick up an
understanding of bar culture, he said.
   Then they advertised for observers, eliminating those who
obviously just expected to have a good time. The observers were
trained to estimate height and weight accurately. They studied
standard bar glassware to learn how much of a drink each type of
glass would contain.

<HEAD>French Girls Still Missing a Day After Reportedly Being Freed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Two French girls captured by Palestinian
guerrillas more than a year ago were still missing Tuesday, a day
after their captors said they had been freed and put on a plane to
Paris.
   Relatives of 7-year-old Marie-Laure Valente and her 6-year-old
sister, Virginie, said in Paris that Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary
Council guerrilla group had refused to give them a precise date for
the girls' return.
   The group's spokesman, Walid Khaled, told The Associated Press
that Nidal himself said goodbye to the girls and approved
arrangements to send them home.
   Khaled also said, however, that ``I cannot set a specific date
for their arrival in Paris.''
   That contradicted Khaled's announcement Monday that the girls
were on their way to Paris by plane. He refused to explain the
discrepancy.
   On Saturday, Khaled said the girls would be freed within 24 hours
``as a Christmas gift'' for the world's children.
   Nidal's group announced Nov. 8 that it had captured the sisters,
their mother, Jacqueline Valente, and five Belgians in a boat off
the Gaza Strip. Ms. Valente and the Belgians have not been released.
   When asked why the adults were still held, Khaled said, ``The
girls are innocent. They have not been tainted.''
   ``The others are tools of the Zionist Mossad (Israel's secret
service) and have made valuable confessions,'' he added, repeating a
charge made when the abductions were first announced. Israel has
denied they were spies.
   In his latest statement, Khaled said Nidal, whose real name is
Sabri el-Banna, and his deputy, Salim Ahmed, met the girls ``to bid
them farewell at a secret Fatah-Revolutionary Council combat outpost
in Lebanon.
   ``The two comrades expressed their satisfaction over the special
security arrangements taken to enable the two girls to reunite
safely with their family.''
   He refused to say when the meeting was held. ``I have reported it
today. That's all,'' he said.
   The sisters ``are very happy because they're being released.
They're eating chocolates and have put on weight,'' Khaled added.
   Other Palestinian sources were skeptical that Nidal, who split
with PLO chief Yasser Arafat in 1974, met the girls in Lebanon.
   ``Abu Nidal has not been anywhere in Lebanon for quite a long
time,'' said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I
can't believe he came in all of a sudden just to say goodbye to the
two French girls.''
   Nidal split from the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974.
Two years later, he formed his underground group and has since
topped wanted lists around the world for masterminding aircraft
hijackings, bombings and assassinations.
   A man who answered the telephone in Khaled's office suggested
that bad weather delayed the girls' arrival home. Several
Mediterranean countries have been lashed by winter storms since the
weekend.
   The children's father, Pascal Betille, grandmother Brigitte
Valente, and Jacqueline Valente's brother-in-law, Andre Metral,
spent the weekend in Beirut and met with Khaled.
   ``Never during our meetings ... were we able to obtain, despite
our insistance, a precise date for the liberation of Marie-Laure and
Virginie,'' said Metral.
   ``I think this will go on several days more, perhaps until
Friday,'' he was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse.
   Ms. Valente gave birth to a girl in captivity and is expecting
another child next month. She had been living with Fernand
Houtekins, one of Belgian captives.
   The other captives are Houtekins' brother, Emmanuel and his wife,
Godelieve and their two children, Laurent, 17, and Valerie, 16.
   Khaled's statement quoted Nidal as saying the release of the
sisters was ``a slap in the face of the real imperialists,
terrorists and murderers headed by Reagan.''
   The statement denounced Reagan's announcement last week that he
was considering military action against an alleged chemical weapons
plant in Libya, which bankrolls Nidal's group.
   ``They (the Americans) should bear the responsibilty for any
expected reactions to this threat by revolutionary forces,'' the
statement warned.

   The United States is resuming economic aid to
Fiji that was suspended last year following a coup attempt in the
Pacific island nation, the State Department said Tuesday.
   A department statement said the decision to resume the aid, which
totaled nearly $1.4 million, was made in view of recent moves by the
Fijian government to restore democracy.
   ``We view as positive steps the return of executive authority to
civilian hands, the suspension of the internal security decree, and
the public commitment of Prime Minister (Kamisese) Mara to a process
that will restore constitutional government,'' the statement said.
   ``In support of these efforts, the president of the United
States, after consultation with the Congress, has decided to restore
economic assistance programs that were statutorily placed on hold
following the May 1987 coup in Fiji,'' it said.

   A passenger on a private jet slapped a pilot
awake in time for an emergency landing after the aircraft lost cabin
pressure and those aboard slipped into unconsciousness, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
   Disaster was averted when a passenger who awoke first hit the
dozing co-pilot twice across the face, according to the front-page
account of the Dec. 7 incident in the Corriere Della Sera newspaper.
   The Lear jet, leased by an oil company, was carrying seven
Italian and Libyan businessmen from Milan to Rome when it was forced
to land in Bologna, the report said.
   The co-pilot denied he was asleep but acknowledged the loss of
pressure caused ``sluggishness,'' the newspaper said.
   The Transport Ministry said Tuesday it was opening an
investigation.

<HEAD>Striking Railroad Workers Demand Resignation of Premier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 railroad workers went on
strike Tuesday and demanded the resignation of Premier Branko
Mikulic, blaming his government for falling living standards, an
official report said.
   The workers, who walked off their jobs at 6 a.m., asked for a 100
percent pay increase, according to the Tanjug news agency and
sources in Ljubljana, capital of the northern republic of Slovenia.
   The average salary of the striking workers, mostly engine
drivers, is $200 a month _ about twice the national average.
   The walkout briefly paralyzed several railroad lines before
engine drivers from other towns replaced the striking workers of the
state-run Ljubljana railway, Tanjug said. A strike committee issued
a warning that Slovenian rail safety could be jeopardized because
the trains were being driven by unskilled personnel.
   It was not clear when the strikerswould return to work.
   The strikers said Mikulic, who leads the federal government in
Belgrade, is responsible for the ``catastrophic'' financial
situation of the country's railroad companies, Tanjug reported
without elaborating.
   Yugoslavia has been faced with increasing social and labor unrest
in protest of a 250 percent annual inflation rate, 15 percent
unemployment and a $21 billion foreign debt. The buying power of the
average citizen has decreased by 25 percent this year, according to
official figures.
   Factory workers and public service employees have staged more
than 1,000 strikes this year.
   Borba, the leading Communist Party daily newsaper, on Monday also
called for the resignation of Mikulic. In a front-page editorial, it
said that if the government is not replaced and the economic
situation does not improve soon, Yugoslavia might be faced with
severe labor unrest.
   ``The patience of the Yugoslav working class is running low,''
Borba said.

   Czechoslovakia also had stopped jamming the station Dec. 16.
   Bulgaria stopped interfering with the station's signals Friday,
said Radio Free Europe spokesman Bob Redlich.
   Bulgaria began the jamming soon after the station went on the air

   Officials from the United States and Laos will
meet next week to discuss the possibility of expanding cooperation
in obtaining an accounting for the estimated 550 American servicemen
listed as missing in Laos from the Vietnam war.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Tuesday
that the officials will meet in Vientiane, the Laotian capital, on
Jan. 2-3.
   The delegation will be led by Richard T. Childress, director of
Asian affairs at the National Security Coucil. It will include
representatives from the State, Commerce and Defense departments.
   The two countries have held talks on numerous occasions, but a
State Department official said this is the first time a Commerce
Department representative will take part.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said the presence
of the Commerce Department official reflects Laotian interest in
expanding trade between the two countries.
   The United States severed trade and diplomatic ties with Vietnam
and Cambodia after the 1975 communist triumph in those countries.
Laos, which is closely allied with Vietnam, has been ruled by a
Marxist government since that same year but the United States
retained trade and diplomatic ties with it.
   The remains of more than 20 Americans have been returned from
Laos in recent years and discussions are under way on sites in Laos
for possible future joint excavations.

   Eighty students who fled Burma after
participating in pro-democracy protests that were crushed in a
military coup returned home Tuesday to an emotional welcome from
their families.
   The students, the first to be repatriated under an agreement
between Thailand and Burma, were flown to Burma from a Thai camp in
Tak, near the border.
   Students led the demonstrations that swept Burma this year and
ended with the Sept. 18 military coup.
   On Monday, Burmese air force planes took the students,
accompanied by journalists, to their hometowns in various parts of
the country. Eight students from the Rangoon area returned by car
and train.
   The commander of the Rangoon military division, Brig. Myo Nyunt,
told the youths to regard their experience as a lesson in choosing
between good and bad.
   Sixteen students rejoined their parents at a reception ceremony
at the airport in Heho, in eastern Shan State.
   The father of Tha Kyaw Myint thanked the authorities for bringing
his 20-year-old son back and asked them also to bring back his
second son from Thailand.
   In the central town of Meiktila, the two sisters of Maung Dipar
wept as they welcomed their brother. Their father, a bank employee,
died in a car accident last month on his way to find his son.
   About 7,000 other students remain along the Thai-Burmese
frontier, where they sought refuge and military training with
anti-government guerrillas living in the jungle.

   A 1986 federal inspection found a
fuselage crack in an aging Boeing 727 that tore open at 31,000 feet,
forcing the airliner, with 110 people aboard, to make its eighth
unscheduled landing in five years.
   Eastern Airlines Flight 251 from Rochester, N.Y., to Atlanta
landed safely Monday at Yeager Airport here after a 14-inch hole in
the fuselage caused the plane to lose cabin pressure, authorities
said.
   Two passengers were treated at Charleston Area Medical Center for
nosebleeds and headaches as a result of the decompression, said Gary
Chernenko, a hospital spokesman.
   Two National Transportation Safety Board officials who inspected
the aircraft plan to send the metal flap that peeled off the
fuselage to the agency's Washington, D.C., laboratory for testing.
   ``It'll go back to our laboratory in Washington, our
metallurgical lab, and they'll use an electron microscope ... to
pinpoint the type of failures on the metal itself,'' NTSB air safety
investigator Pamela Kleckner said today.
   The area of the fuselage containing the tear ``is newer than the
aircraft ... it had been replacement skin,'' said NTSB spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz in Washington.
   It could be six months before a final determination is made on
what happened, Kleckner said.
   Passenger Sam Piazza, 55, a former pilot from Boca Raton, Fla.,
said he and his wife at first thought a bomb had exploded, a
possible cause of last week's crash of Pan Am Flight 103 with 258
aboard in Scotland.
   ``We were cruising along and you could hear the rush of the wind
and the pitch of the wind and all of a sudden you could hear a big
pop,'' he said.
   ``I looked up, and I could see sunlight shining through'' the
cabin roof, said another passenger, David Moore of Phoenix.
   The opening in the crown of the fuselage was ``about a 14-inch
square hole,'' said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jack
Barker in Atlanta. ``Those things start with a crack and end up as a
hole.''
   A five-inch crack had been found on the fuselage of the plane in
an inspection in July 1986, and corrosion and a tiny wing crack were
found in April 1987, said Bobbie Mardis of the FAA's safety data
branch in Oklahoma City.
   Lopatkiewicz, asked whether the previous cracks were suspected in
Monday's incident, said, ``That we don't know, I suppose it's
possible, but we don't have any information on the maintenance and
the timing on when things had been done.''
   Federal officials also said mechanical problems, including a
failure to maintain cabin pressure in June 1986, had forced the jet
to land at least seven times during the past five years, before
Monday's incident.
   Other reasons for the unscheduled landings included an engine
compressor stall in 1986 and a loss of engine oil in 1986.
   However, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami said the
20-year-old jet was maintained acording to FAA guidelines and ``had
an inspection of the crown in September _ that's the whole top area
from the cockpit to the tail.'' The results of the September
inspection were not immediately available.
   ``From what I understand from what they've pulled up on this
plane, there's nothing unusual in its history,'' she said.
   ``Nothing I saw there would qualify as an emergency,'' said Fred
Farrar, an FAA spokesman in Washington who had reviewed reports on
the aircraft's mechanical difficulties.
   The aviation industry recently has focused on the problem of
jetliner aging, due in part to an April 28 incident in which the
roof of a 19-year-old Boeing 737 tore off an Aloha Airlines flight
at 24,000 feet, killing one person and injuring 61.
   The following month, an American Airlines Boeing 727 was forced
to make an unscheduled landing in Detroit because of a 15-inch crack
in the wheel well that was attributed to metal fatigue.
   The Aloha accident prompted a federal investigation into the
aging fleet of jets, and the FAA ordered airlines to replace rivets
believed to have caused cracks. Boeing also has undertaken studies
of its older airplanes to determine the effect of aging on
airworthiness.
   Federal officials today continued their background check of the
Eastern plane, which remained here after the forced landing, and
were looking at other planes of the same type, authorities said.
   Boeing spokesman T. Craig Martin said Monday he doesn't know
anything about the aircraft's previous problems.
   ``This plane was designed so that if there is some kind of
puncture in the skin, the pressure will be let off safely. That's
what happened. The plane landed safely,'' the spokesman in Seattle
said.
   The incident occurred at 31,000 feet about 50 miles, or several
minutes' flying time, north of Charleston, said Garland Jones, the
flight's first officer.
   Oxygen masks were deployed. Pilot John Sullivan, a 20-year
veteran, took the plane down to 10,000 feet, an altitude at which
passengers could breathe without the masks, said Jones.
   Some passengers later complained their masks didn't work. Jones
said they probably didn't realize that the masks have to be pulled
by hand to initiate the oxygen flow.
   Others said their ears ached for hours after landing.
   Aside from the pressure loss, the jet experienced no other
trouble, said the FAA's Barker.
   Passenger Moore, 39, said he was worried about the flight from
the beginning.
   Before takeoff, ``there was a definite wind noise, not from the
back of the plane but from above our heads,'' Moore said. ``The
(second officer) came back, looked at it and decided it wasn't
anything.''
   But Jones said the second officer was only helping flight
attendants close the aft door before takeoff.
   Eastern, which does not service West Virginia, flew the 104
passengers and six crew members to Atlanta.

<TEXT>
   Mines laid by Iran and Iraq are
believed to be still adrift in the Persian Gulf, where shipping is
increasing following the cease-fire, a U.S. Navy officier said
Tuesday.
   Lt. Cmdr. John K. Ross, skipper of the mine sweeper USS Fearless,
said the Shatt-al-Arab waterway that forms the southern boundary
between the two countries is particularly risky.
   About 180 mines have been discovered in the gulf since U.S. and
other foreign navies intervened to protect shipping from Iranian
attack in July 1987, Ross said.
   ``I hope they're all gone, but I believe more mines are still
here in the gulf,'' he said.
   He noted that Western navy patrols have not ventured into
northern waters, where Iranian and Iraqi forces were active until
the Aug. 20 cease-fire ended the eight-year war.
   ``We've searched up to Kuwait, but no further. Someone has to
check the Shatt-al-Arab,'' said Ross.
   As shipping in the gulf increases, U.S. officers have voiced
fears that rough winter seas could tear moored mines from their
anchors to float south into shipping lanes.
   No ship has hit a mine since the cease-fire.
   Ross declined to estimate how many mines remain, but U.S. sources
put the number as high as 200, mainly in the northern sector.
   Iran claims it has cleared mines in northern waters and other
sectors since the cease-fire. But there has been no independent
confirmation.
   Ross said 166 mines _ 82 moored to the seabed and 84 floating _
were discovered between July 1987 and the cease-fire.
   Of these, he said 16 were found off the United Arab Emirates port
of Khor Fakkan in the Gulf of Oman and eight near Iran's Rostam oil
platform in the southern gulf.
   Eight were discovered near the Shah Olam shoals in the central
gulf off Qatar. Another 18 were laid by the Iranian vessel Iran Ajar
or found aboard it when U.S. forces seized it in that sector last
year, he said.
   Eighteen mines were discovered near Iran's Farsi island, a base
for speedboat-borne Revolutionary Guards who attacked shipping in
the northern waterway, and 14 near Kuwait's main Al-Ahmadi oil
terminal in the northern sector, Ross added.
   Another 15-20 mines have been found since August, he said.
   It is believed Iran planted most mines, which were found by mine
sweepers of the U.S.-led foreign navy armada, aided by some gulf
states.
   Ross' vessel and the mine sweeper USS Inflict and the USS
Raleigh, an amphibious warfare vessel that acts as supply ship,
currently are berthed at a United Arab Emirates port for rest and
resupply.
   Four other U.S. mine sweepers operate in the gulf.
   Although some foreign navies have retrenched their forces since
the cease-fire, Ross said he did not believe further cuts were
likely soon. Iran and Iraq still are negotiating a peace treaty.

   The priest who provided a haven for an ailing
suspect arrested last January in the 1951 strangling of an
8-year-old girl said he believes the former carnival worker did not
kill the girl.
   ``I believe he's innocent. He brought the subject up once in a
conversation and said, `I didn't do it,''' said the Rev. David
Hagan, who runs a Philadelphia shelter where the suspect, William
Redmond, lived while his case was being processed.
   ``It's a gut feeling I have that he was telling the truth,'' he
said.
   Redmond's trial in the April 1951 slaying has been postponed
indefinitely, and the frail, 66-year-old defendant has been allowed
to return to his Nebraska home to die.
   Redmond, who lived quietly for more than 30 years in Grand
Island, Neb., was brought to Pennsylvania last January when State
Police Trooper Malcolm Murphy said he had tracked him down as the
elusive killer in the old murder case.
   The trooper said he had a dramatic confession in the 1951 death
of Jane Marie Althoff, a Chester girl whose body was found in a
carnival truck on the grounds where Redmond operated a Ferris wheel.
   However, defense attorney Michael Malloy has contended the
confession is tainted and that Redmond was pressured into giving it
following 14 hours of intense interrogation.
   He said the statement does not jibe with the facts of the girl's
death, and was given just weeks after Redmond had been in intensive
care in a Nebraska hospital.

<HEAD>Owners Pay Back Taxes On Land Whose Location They Don't Know</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOPKINTON, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No one knows if there is even any land
there, but the owners of an 11-acre parcel have paid three years
worth of back taxes anyway, town officials said Tuesday.
   Victor Nascimento said he and his relatives decided to pay the
$222 tax bill so officials in this rural Rhode Island community
would not auction the land he and a brother, now dead, bought sight
unseen in 1971 for back taxes.
   ``We've got 18 years invested in this. What we're hoping to do is
hang in there for a year or two and see what happens,'' Nascimento
said. ``We're definitely sure there is land there _ but where it is
I don't know.''
   When the Nascimentos bought the parcel for $2,100, they could not
afford a title search so they signed a quit-claim deed, which
relieves the seller of any liability.
   They paid taxes every year between 1970 and 1985, when a town
official informed Nascimento's wife, Lois, that the lot's status was
in question.
   Although town officials concede they don't know where the land is
either, they said the law obliges them to collect taxes on all land
for which a deed has been filed at Town Hall.
   This time, Nascimento is determined to find out whether the land
exists.
   In addition to the tax bill, Nascimento paid $233 for a title
search and advertising fees.
   If he finds out he was swindled on the land sale, Nascimento
plans to try to recover the $2,800 in taxes he and his family have
paid since 1970.
   ``If there's no land, they shouldn't be taxing it,'' Nascimento
said.

   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda on Tuesday
urged the United States to stop supporting Angolan rebels and paid
rare tribute to the Western nation, for mediating talks to bring
peace to southwestern Africa.
   A summit meeting of the six Front-line States in direct
confrontation with South Africa called for U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to hasten independence in South-West Africa,
also known as Namibia, and ensure the machinery for independence
remains under the control of the world body.
   The leaders of Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe also appealed to the international community for military
and other support during Namibia's U.N.-supervised transition to
independence.
   It was the first Front-line summit since Angola, Cuba and South
Africa signed a U.S.-negotiated peace accord.
   Under the agreement, signed Thursday in New York, South Africa
will grant independence to mineral-rich Namibia while Cuba withdraws
50,000 troops from Angola within 27 months.
   Opening the summit, Kaunda called on President-elect George Bush
to help the peace process by halting support to Jonas Savimbi's
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   Savimbi's rebels have been fighting Angola's Marxist government
since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The
guerrillas orginally were backed by South Africa, which for 73 years
has governed Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia. But in recent
years they also have won support from Washington.
   Neither Savimbi's movement nor guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization fighting for Namibian independence were
involved directly in the peace accord.
   However, Namibian guerrilla leader Sam Nujoma said on the eve of
the summit that he hoped this Christmas would be the last under
South African occupation for Namibia's 1 million people.
   At the summit, Kaunda praised the Reagan administration for
mediating months of fractured talks that finally resulted in the
accord. But he echoed black leaders' fears that South Africa will
renege.
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, whose nation stands to
gain most from the pact, was more optimistic. He declared Sunday he
was happy with the terms and predicted southern Africa would be
``transformed in the near future into a zone of peace and
international cooperation.''
   Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe have
been at the forefront of African efforts to end Pretoria's policy of
legal race separation and speed Namibian independence.
   Also at the summit are the three main guerrilla-backed political
movements fighting in southern Africa _ Nujoma's organization, and
the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress of
South Africa.

<HEAD>New York Critics Pan Long-Awaited `Legs Diamond'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broadway critics aimed their guns at ``Legs
Diamond,'' the long-awaited Peter Allen musical about the big-time
New York mobster.
   The negative reviews for the troubled show, which opened Monday
at the Mark Hellinger Theater, included a scathing pan from The New
York Times.
   But Glenna Freedman, press agent for the show, said producers had
no immediate plans to close to $5.1 million show, the only musical
of Broadway's meager fall season.
   ```Legs Diamond' is a sobering interlude of minimum-security
imprisonment that may inspire you to pull out a pen and attend to
long-neglected tasks, like finishing last Sunday's crossword puzzle
or balancing a checkbook,'' said Frank Rich, chief drama critic of
The Times.
   The musical received a lot of media attention as it went through
weeks of preview performances and extensive changes while its
production team revamped the show. The opening, scheduled for Dec.
1, was postponed first to Dec. 11 and then to Monday.
   Rich also slammed Allen, the Australian-born singer who stars in
and wrote the music and lyrics for the musical.
   ``If there's any mystery to `Legs Diamond,' it is the one
attending Mr. Allen, not the gangster he purports to play. Here is a
performer with a single expression _ a pop-eyed,
I-dare-you-not-to-love-me grin _ and a harsh singing voice as taut
as his face.''
   Michael Kuchwara of The Associated Press called the show ``a
musical in search of a leading man.'' He praised the score but found
the book, written by Harvey Fierstein and Charles Suppon, ``the
skimpiest story this side of `Starlight Express.'''
   Clive Barnes in the New York Post wondered, ``Could it possibly
be as bad as it seemed, indeed as people said? The good news is that
it isn't. The bad news is that it isn't all that better either.''
   Howard Kissel in the New York Daily News said the musical ``isn't
even bad enought to laugh at. It's just dull.''
   Linda Winer of Newsday agreed.
   She wrote that the show ``has no charm, no wit, no heart and,
most conspicuous of all, no point.''
   ``Legs Diamond'' had $10 million in advance ticket sales, but
used up approximately half that amount during its previews. The show
had been grossing more than $400,000 a week during previews.
   The producers, a group that includes the Nederlander theater
organization and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, said
tickets are on sale into April.

   Thousands of Sudanese demonstrated Tuesday
or stayed away from work, demanding the civilian government resign
because of price increases.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government vowed to keep new prices,
the highest being a 600 percent increase putting sugar at 26 cents a
pound.
   ``We will not be ruled by the government of hunger,'' chanted one
group of demonstrators. They all dispersed after dark.
   But the powerful Sudan Workers' Trade Union Federation said it
was organizing a mass demonstration Wednesday from its downtown
headquarters to Mahdi's office to present a protest memorandum. The
union controls 1 million workers.
   At least 5,000 students and workers demonstrated in different
areas of Khartoum during the day.
   They burned tires and garbage in the streets. Riot police watched
them but did not intervene except in one known incident in Omdurman,
Khartoum's twin city across the Nile, where they chased protesters
with battons and sticks to force them to disperse.
   There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
   ``Long live the struggle of the working class!'' demonstrators
shouted. Others chanted, ``Shame on you, government of hunger.''
   Similar demonstrations took place in Wad Medani, Sudan's second
city 110 miles southeast of Khartoum. Labor unions ordered protest
strikes there and in Atbara, 225 miles north of the capital.
   On Monday, the government ordered big increases in prices of
sugar, raised the price of cigarettes by 50 percent and levied a new
15 percent tax on all locally made commodities.
   The announcement came just two days after the government raised
salaries of both public and prviate sector workers. Wage increases
ranged between 500 percent for those earning the monthly minimum
wage of less than $10 to 50 percent increases for highest-paid
employees.
   The increases will cost the government $174 million for a million
state employees.
   Finance Minister Omar Nur Dayem said Tuesday the government had
to introduce the price increases because they would pay for the
salary increases. He said the government would not revoke the
increases.
   Khartoum's communist newspaper Al-Maidan said Tuesday the
government ``has taken with its left hand what it has given with its
right.''
   Sudan has been financially strapped for years. A civil war
against southern rebels, which began in 1983, has been costing an
estimated $1 million daily as the foreign debt has swelled to $13
billion.

<HEAD>Bush Inaugural May Prove Cheaper To Taxpayers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retiring senator, angry that taxpayers
shelled out nearly $16 million for President Reagan's 1985
inauguration, is counting on one paragraph of a massive defense bill
to keep history from repeating itself.
   But just how Sen. William Proxmire's provision will affect
President-elect Bush's party remains unclear _ both to inaugural
officials and the Pentagon, which accounted for $10 million of the
federal spending in 1985.
   Tucked deep in the defense authorization act for fiscal 1989 is
the Wisconsin Democrat's paragraph saying the defense secretary
should seek reimbursement for troops used at private inaugural
events, and only volunteers should be used at such events.
   Despite some confusion about the provision at the Pentagon and
the private Presidential Inaugural Committee planning the Bush
festivities, both say they will heed the guideline.
   ``The Department of Defense does intend to seek reimbursement
where appropriate for support rendered,'' said Capt. Gail Hayes, a
spokesman for the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee. She defined
``where appropriate'' as meaning private events, but had no further
details.
   ``We'll make sure that we comply,'' said Stephen Studdert,
executive director of the PIC. ``If they (military men and women)
are not supposed to be somewhere, they won't be. If we're required
to reimburse the Defense Department, we will in every case.''
   Jan Baran, general counsel to the PIC, maintained there had been
``no comprehensive change in the law dealing with inaugurations.''
But he said the committee has worked out guidelines with government
agencies and ``there is unprecedented scrutiny of what will or will
not be used that will require reimbursement to the government.''
   A General Accounting Office report last year found that the
Pentagon alone spent $10 million on 1985 inaugural activities _
including the use of soldiers as chauffeurs, photographers and
escorts. Six other agencies spent nearly $6 million more.
   Ron Tammen, Proxmire's administrative assistant, said the new
provision is meant to relieve military people of chores like driving
VIP spouses to beauty parlors and restrict federal subsidies of
balls and other events he called ``virtual political payoffs.''
   Neither Baran, Studdert nor Hayes could say how much repayment
the Pentagon could expect from troop participation in private events
next month. However, the PIC officials said they are trying to cut
down on federal employees and use more contractors and volunteers
for entertainment, coat-checking and other activities.
   ``In the past... many government employees from all sorts of
agencies would work on the inaugural. That is extremely curtailed
this time,'' Baran said.
   The fiscal impact of the new policy is ``hard to measure,''
Studdert said. ``It may not add on to the overall cost (of $20 to
$25 million). We may save on other categories by increasing
volunteer use. That's our hope.''
   Hayes said her committee is still awaiting a request from the
PIC, but does not anticipate a drop in the number of people it will
be asked to assign to inaugural duties. ``Our best estimate is that
DOD participation will be 8,500 people,'' she said _ the same as in
1985.
   The Bush inaugural is being billed as the most open ever, but the
schedule of events Jan. 18-22 is still heavily weighted toward
exclusive, private events.
   Baran said an event is considered public if 50 percent of the
tickets are available to the public. He said that would apply to
eight inaugural events _ among them a parade, a pageant, a
children's festival, an ``American Tribute to Democracy'' and a
thanksgiving service at Washington Cathedral.
   He said the other 15 events are private: nine balls, a worship
service, a dinner, a gala, a vice presidential reception, a salute
to the first lady and a celebration for young Americans.
   It remains to be seen exactly how the Pentagon and the private
inaugural committee will interpret the congressional recommendations.
   Studdert said a military band playing ``Hail to the Chief,'' for
example, would be a case of that unit performing a usual function,
and therefore would not entail reimbursement.
   But Tammen said Congress intends that the Pentagon be reimbursed
no matter what function the troops perform, if the event is private.
``We specifically meant to prevent the use of the military at balls
and galas, which are exclusively to entertain the VIPS _ (Bush)
supporters and Republicans,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate in Nanking Over African Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Chinese youths demonstrated Tuesday
in Nanking, calling on their government to punish African students
who battled Chinese over the weekend, an American witness said.
   It was the third major, anti-black protest in the Jiangsu
province capital in three days. After several days of violence,
police for the first time took stern measures to control the crowds.
   Hundreds of officers, many wearing riot gear, filled the city.
Some cruised the streets in trucks, others stood on street corners,
pushing back crowds.
   A band of 200 police stood guard around the city's main hotel for
foreigners, said the witness, David Chen, 19, of Princeton Junction,
N.J.
   Chinese authorities, meanwhile, released five Americans who had
been held incommunicado with 140 African students in a guest house
on the outskirts of Nanking. The Africans continued to be held
because Chinese authorities said they could not guarantee their
safety. One American and about 20 students from Western Europe and
Japan stayed with them.
   Police forced the Africans and the other students to the guest
house Monday night after Chinese authorities refused to allow the
Africans to take trains to Beijing. The Africans feared authorities
in Nanking could not protect them following a clash with Chinese
students Saturday night and anti-black riots Sunday.
   Two of the released Americans, Elizabeth Morrison and Elizabeth
Chace, said police dragged them and the other students from the
Nanking train station Monday night.
   ``Five soldiers grabbed Elizabeth and then five soldiers grabbed
me and they just dragged us out of the station,'' said Ms. Chace of
Weston, Mass., speaking by telephone from Nanking.
   ``They were just dragging everyone out,'' said Ms. Morrisson, 20,
of Prairie Village, Kan. ``Some people struggled so violently, they
were hurt.''
   The clashes and demonstrations, which began Saturday, are the
latest in a series of incidents between Chinese and some of the
1,500 African students invited to show Beijing's solidarity with
other Third World nations.
   Relations between Africans and Chinese have been strained.
Chinese are often openly racist, saying black people are dirty. They
also look down on some African countries for their poverty.
   The problem is compounded because African students in China are
mostly single men, who spend up to six years and wish to date
Chinese women.
   Many Chinese students also are dissatisfied with relatively
low-paying jobs upon graduation and scant freedom to choose their
profession. The clash Saturday seemed like a ready excuse to vent
such grievances.
   The demonstrations in Nanking are the largest student marches
since the winter of 1986-87 when hundreds of thousands of students
in dozens of cities demanded democracy.
   The Nanking demonstrations appear similar to marches earlier this
year in Beijing, when students called on the government to punish
the murderers of a student. In these incidents, law and order has
been emphasized and political slogans muted.
   The clashes in Nanking began Saturday when African students at
Hehai University wanted to bring two Chinese women to a party but
refused a guard's request for the women's identification.
   In a brawl that followed, 11 Chinese and two Africans were
injured, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Demonstrations and rock-throwing continued Sunday and Monday with
thousands of Chinese participating, American witnesses said. Police
stood by as Chinese broke windows and ransacked African student
dormitories, they yaid.
   ``Kill the black devils!'' and ``Black devils, go home!'' the
crowd chanted Sunday.
   On Monday, a leaflet was circulated calling for tough punishment
for the Africans.
   ``At a time when compatriots are being beaten and the law is
trampled on,'' said Chen, quoting from the leaflet, ``at a time when
the race is being humiliated, any tolerance we show to the thugs is
a betrayal to the race.''
   Demonstrations continued Tuesday night. Chen said he saw 2,500
youths massing at a building north of the university. He said a
group of about 300 policeman blocked the crowd's path. Another group
of about 1,000 gathered two hours later in another part of the city.
Hundreds of officers kept them off the streets, he said.
   ``They were all calling for the arrest of the blacks involved in
the fight on Christmas Eve,'' Chen said.
   About 200 police officers with helmets and truncheons guarded the
entrance to the Jinling Hotel, the city's tallest building. Chen
said he saw no violence and no arrests.
   He quoted the student leaflet as calling on Chinese to ``rise
together and take action.''
   ``Where is the honor of the Chinese race?'' the leaflet said,
``Where is the honor of the law of the People's Republic of China?''
   Most Chinese are members of the Han race and for centuries their
concept of nationhood has been based on their shared race and
culture.
   A U.S. diplomat said officials from several African countries met
with Chinese officials in Nanking. Some of the countries involved
were Zaire, Ghana, the Congo, Benin, Burundi, Cameron, Senegal and
Niger.

   Legislators in Uzbekistan have rejected a budget
plan from the republic's leadership and written their own, Tass said
Tuesday.
   ``This is without precedent,'' the official news agency said in
reporting the action.
   The opposition shown by a majority of the Uzbek legislators came
less than two months after a few representatives to the Supreme
Soviet made history by casting the first handful of ``no'' votes in
more than 60 years.
   Tass did not give the date of the vote or the number of ``yes''
and ``no'' votes in Uzbekistan, in Central Asia.
   The first ``no'' votes in any Soviet legislature came at the end
of October when 31 of 1,500 deputies in the Supreme Soviet voted
against two government decrees limiting demonstrations.
   The Uzbek Supreme Soviet rejected the republic leadership's
budget for 1989, saying it underestimated the production capacity of
government-owned industry by hundreds of millions of rubles, Tass
said.
   The Uzbek legislators found ``unreasonably low plan targets for
many industries,'' Tass reported. After calling various industry
ministers to committee meetings, it worked out an entirely new
budget that increased industrial output by $477 million.
   The agricultural plan was boosted by $272 million, Tass said.
   The deputies shifted tens of millions of dollars from
construction of new industry to housing _ in extremely short supply
throughout the Soviet Union _ schools and hospitals, Tass said.
Funding also rose for social and ecological programs, it said.
   Legislators found that Uzbek industry could make up for the lost
funding through better management, advanced technology and support
for initiative, Tass said.
   These same deputies previously ``read a draft plan on the eve of
the session, discussed it quickly and formally at the session and
`unanimously' approved it,'' Tass said.
   ``They invariably counted on the republic's council of ministers
to correct possible mistakes,'' the news agency said.
   The Uzbek legislature now has 12 committees working between
sessions to solve political, social and economic problems, Tass
said, quoting the legislature's president, Pulat Khabibullaev.
   Many Uzbek leaders have been arrested in the past year in a
corruption scandal in which, among other things, conspirators
underreported cotton production and kept the difference.
   The criminals covered themselves with a network of bribes that
allegedly reached even to a former Soviet interior minister, who has
since committed suicide. His deputy, Yuri Churbanov, the son-in-law
of the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, is awaiting a verdict in
his bribery trial. In the past month, the alleged reform leader of
the Uzbek Communist Party also has been arrested.

<HEAD>Houston Oilman Glenn McCarthy Dead at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oilman Glenn Herbert McCarthy, who rose from
laborer to national fame as the multimillionaire ``King of the
Wildcatters'' in the 1940s and inspired the best-selling novel
``Giant,'' died in a Houston nursing home. He was 81.
   McCarthy, the son of an itinerant oil field worker who became one
of the world's most successful independent oilmen, died Monday,
according to George H. Lewis & Sons Funeral Home. The cause of death
was not disclosed.
   By his own estimate, he drilled more than 1,000 oil and gas
wells, most of them in Texas but others as far away as Egypt and
Bolivia.
   In his heyday, McCarthy lived in a mansion, surrounded himself
with Hollywood celebrities and powerful politicians and became known
as ``Diamond Glenn'' for his flashy lifestyle.
   McCarthy had said in an earlier interview that he was dubbed
``The King of the Wildcatters'' by journalist Ernie Pyle, the
renowned war correspondent who was killed in World War II.
   The best-selling book ``Giant'' by Edna Ferber and 1956 movie of
the same title starring James Dean and Elizabeth Taylor was based on
McCarthy.
   McCarthy, who was born in Beaumont, dropped out of college to go
into business for himself. At age 23 married 16-year-old Faustine
Lee, the daughter of wealthy Texas oilman T.P. Lee. But his
father-in-law disapproved of the marriage.
   McCarthy bought and sold a cleaning business and two filling
stations before he struck out on his own in the oil business.
   By age 26, he had founded two oil fields, extended a third and
become a millionaire. He had his first strike at Anahuac, an oil
field where the major oil companies had drilled only dry holes and
geologists said there was no oil. By 1945, he had discovered 11
Texas oil fields and drilled wells that extended several others.
   His wealth in 1949 was estimated at $200 million from 400
producing oil and gas wells, and he counted among his friends Sen.
Joe McCarthy, Howard Hughes, Frank Sinatra, John Wayne and Gen.
Douglas MacArthur.
   In what was often referred to as ``Houston's biggest party,'' he
spent more than $1 million to open his $21 million, 18-story
Shamrock Hotel on March 17, 1949, amid a trainload of movie stars
and Texas socialites. He had 2,500 shamrocks flown in from Ireland
for the opening ceremonies, and the meat served at the fete was from
champion livestock.
   He owned a 15,000-acre ranch in West Texas and through the years
owned cattle, a radio station, two banks, newspapers, chemical
companies, steel mills, a motion picture production company, an
export-import company, and thousands of acres of land. He served as
chairman of Eastern Airlines and president of the U.S. Petroleum
Association.
   In the early 1950s, his luck began running out and he began
losing his fortune on West Texas oil wells that didn't produce and
because government oil price ceiling reduced his earnings. Insurance
companies that financed McCarthy's oil-well risks took over most of
his investments.
   In his later years, he settled into a low-profile lifestyle and
lived in a two-story house near La Porte.
   He is survived by his widow, Faustine; three daughters; and a son.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The once-banned songs by a soldier about his
experiences in the Afghan war will be published by the Red Army and
recorded on the state-run record label, the Communist Party
newspaper said Tuesday.
   In an article marking the ninth anniversary of Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan, Pravda touched on Soviet society's
lingering pain over the continuing war as Soviet diplomats seek new
political solutions.
   Listening to the songs of Yuri Kirsanov, who served twice in
Afghanstan, ``you again see the face of a dead friend, feel the hail
of stones from a nearby explosion, suffer, smile, and cry,'' wrote
Pravda correspondent V. Verstakov.
   He recalled how when he returned from his first trip to
Afghanistan, Soviet customs agents listened for Kirsanov's songs on
any tapes.
   He quoted one officer as telling Kirasanov, ``Judging by your
songs, you don't believe in anything.''
   Nevertheless, the singer and his songs remain widely popular
among Afghan veterans. Many Soviets believe he died in action.
   Pravda said it found Kirsanov, 37, in the city of Zhdanov, and
that he told the paper he had believed in the possibility of
bringing peace to Afghanistan. ``We believed in that, honestly.
That's why I sang,'' he said.
   In one of Kirsanov's songs, a girl says to Soviet soldiers:
``You're searching for minutes of happiness, but I know in the
mountains the rebels sit sharpening their knives against Russians.''
   Pravda did not say when it found Kirsanov.
   ``At the military publishers a collection `The Times Chose Us' is
being prepared in which they are publishing for the first time not
only the words but the music to Kirsanov's songs,'' Pravda said.
   It said the state-run record label Melodiya was preparing a
record of Kirsanov's songs for release toward theend of the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The ninth anniversary of Soviet intervention in Afghanistan comes
at the end of a year in which the Soviets withdrew half of their
estimated 100,000 soldiers there. Forces of the pro-Soviet Afghan
army remained under heavy pressure from anti-Marxist rebels.
   Tass said two people were killed Tuesday in rebel attacks on the
northern city of Kunduz and on the capital, Kabul. It said the
shelling of Kabul was the first in a month and a half.
   According to a U.N.-brokered agreement signed in April, all
Soviet troops are to be completely withdrawn from Afghanistan by
Feb. 15. Moscow halted the withdrawal in the fall, citing continued
U.S. and Pakistani aid to the Afghan rebels.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed in a speech at the United
Nations Dec. 7 that a cease-fire be imposed on Jan. 1 and all
military supplies to the country be cut off.
   Soviet officials this month also met face-to-face with leaders of
the Afghan opposition and with exiled Afghan King Zaher Shah to
discuss a plan for convening a council of 50 to 60 politicians or
prominent figures to create a new government.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan on Dec. 27, 1979, replaced
one pro-Soviet government with another and remained on to fight the
insurgents.
   Military officials said earlier this year that more than 13,000
Soviet soldiers had died in Afghanistan and that more than 35,000
had been wounded.
   Those who have returned have faced the indifference of many
Soviets and a bewildering array of problems in getting benefits to
which they are entitled by law.
   The war is among the most popular topics for young Soviets who
gather in parks to sing or listen to amateur musicians.
   The Pravda article Tuesday echoed a passionate article in the
youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda Dec. 21 that cited letters from
Afghan veterans and their families.
   That article said the time was coming to bring to light documents
revealing how officials made the decision to send soldiers to
Afghanistan.
   ``We will find out not only about the bravery of our lads, about
successful operations, but also, possibly, about the failures of
experts or diplomats,'' the newspaper said.
   ``Afghanistan, like an open wound, will pain the spirit yet for
many years,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Police imposed curfews in 23 towns of a
southern state Tuesday, a day after mobs angered by the slaying of a
state legislator set fire to buildings and vehicles, news reports
said.
   At least 32 people were killed and 100 injured in Monday's
violence in Andhra Pradesh state, United News of India reported.
   The rampage was brought under control after police opened fire
into the crowds, the report said.
   The violence was set off by the slaying of V. Mohan Ranga Rao, a
legislator of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party.
Assailants with axes killed him and two of his supporters in a
pre-dawn attack Monday in Vijaywada, about 860 miles south of New
Delhi.
   Rao, who was on a hunger strike to protest police harassment, had
a feud with a political rival belonging to the Telugu Desam Party
that governs the state, the New Delhi edition of The Hindu newspaper
said.
   After the slaying, angry mobs rampaged and set fire to buses,
cinemas, shops and hotels in Vijaywada and four neighboring towns,
United News said. At least 17 of the victims died when police opened
fire on the crowds, it said.
   The state on Tuesday observed a strike called by the Congress
Party to protest the legislator's death.
   Hundreds of paramilitary troops were deployed to control any
resurgence of violence and police were ordered to shoot curfew
violators, the news agency said.
   On Monday, supporters of the Congress Party attacked the homes of
senior Telugu Desam leaders in the state capital, Hyderabad, the
agency said. There were no reports of casualties.

   Troops raiding a West Bank village shot and
killed a 25-year-old Palestinian on Tuesday, and another 19 were
wounded by army gunfire in other clashes in the occupied lands, Arab
hospital officials said.
   An army official said troops wounded only 10 Palestinians. He
confirmed the raid in Abwein village, but said officials still were
investigating reports of the death.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he would renew his contacts
with Palestinian leaders in the occupied lands, calling them
Israel's partners for negotiating a peace settlement.
   ``We favor a dialogue between us and the residents of the
territories,'' Rabin told Israel television. He reiterated that the
government would not negotiate with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which Israel calls a terrorist organization.
   During the Abwein raid, troops clashed with stone-throwing
villagers and at one point opened fire, the army official said.
   Later, the army received reports from nearby Ramallah Hospital
that villager Mohammed Omar Ahmed Khalil died of gunshot wounds, he
said.
   The army was unable to confirm the cause of death because
relatives took the body from the hospital, the official said.
   A Ramallah Hospital official said Khalil was shot in the shoulder
and lung and died after arriving at the hospital.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official quoted Khalil's
relatives as saying the man was in a village store when a group of
soldiers burst inside and opened fire.
   The death brought to 337 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
began Dec. 8, 1987. Fourteen Israelis also have died.
   In Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, eight youths were shot in
clashes with troops. After the first two were wounded, hundreds of
residents poured into narrow alleys of the shantytown to protest the
casualties, said Arab witnesses and hospital officials.
   Soldiers responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and then plastic
bullets, witnesses said.
   In the Balata refugee camp on the West Bank, 16-year-old Mahmoud
Saqer was critically injured after being struck with a bullet in the
left eye, said officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital.
   Ten teen-agers were wounded in clashes elsewhere, including a
15-year-old from Gaza's Khan Yunis refugee camp who was in serious
condition with a bullet wound in the genitals.
   Also Tuesday, Attorney General Micha Harish ordered police to
investigate whether Jewish settlers should be charged with
incitement for calling for the establishment of a state called
``Free Judea'' in the occupied West Bank, Israel radio said.
   The ``Council for Free Judea'' said Monday it would declare an
independent state Jan. 18 to press demands for Israeli annexation of
the occupied lands.
   ``This is not a revolt but a strong gesture of no confidence in
the Israeli government,'' group leader Rabbi Michael Ben-Horin, an
army reserve captain, told Israel radio on Monday.
   In another development, six Gaza Strip Palestinians facing
deportation withdrew their Supreme Court appeals. Four of the men
face immediate expulsion.
   The two others struck a deal. They promised to stay away from
Israel and the occupied territories for five years, and then be
allowed to return on condition they refrain from anti-Israeli
activities during their exile.
   Since the uprising began, 36 Palestinians have been deported by
Israel and a total of 24 face expulsion. The United States and other
Western nations have condemned deportations as a violation of
international human rights conventions.
   In downtown Jerusalem, a small bomb exploded in a trash can in a
crowded shopping district. There were no injuries or damage.
   ``This is definitely a terrorist attack,'' said police spokesman
Rafi Levy, citing the explosion's location in the heart of Jewish
west Jerusalem. Levy said 13 Arabs were rounded up for questioning.

<HEAD>Reformers Claim They Frozen Out of Plans for Anti-Stalin Monument</HEAD>

   Leading cultural and academic figures Tuesday
accused the Culture Ministry of co-opting their plans for nationwide
memorials to victims of Stalin with a half-hearted design
competition limited to the Soviet capital.
   ``I think this is an effort, after so many victims, to shake off
the historical memory with the help of one or another stone or
bronze monument,'' said poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko. ``This appears to
be a blow against our organizations as a whole.''
   Writer Yuri Karyakin said he saw an ``extraordinarily dangerous
symptom'' of continued government monopoly over social activity
despite President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms. ``Revolution from
above needs support from below,'' he said.
   Yevtushenko, Karyakin, historian Yuri Afanasyev, magazine editor
Vitaly Korotich and other figures in the forefront of Gorbachev's
reform effort spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Memorial
society.
   Founders of the group of lesser-known activists began collecting
signatures late last year demanding a memorial to victims of
dictator Josef Stalin's repression. They were repeatedly arrested
and fined until they gained official support this year.
   In July, Gorbachev himself spoke out in favor of the project. It
is of vital interest in a society still coming to grips with the
millions of deaths that occurred during Stalin's 1924-1953 rule.
Many Soviets have relatives who were killed or sent to prison camps
in that time.
   In late November, Memorial sponsored an unofficial ``Week of
Conscience'' and displayed proposals for a memorial complex.
   But the Ministry of Culture, in a Tuesday announcement in the
newspaper Soviet Culture, revealed plans for a competition to design
a monument that excluded Memorial.
   Sponsors listed included only officially recognized organizations
such as artistic unions and the Moscow city government. Memorial is
an informal organization that has scheduled its founding conference
for the end of January.
   The ministry project calls for construction of a single monument
in Moscow. But Memorial has called for establishment of a more
comprehensive center to educate people about Stalin's terror through
the use of archives and other historical materials. More than 100
local Memorial groups are pushing for similar projects in cities
throughout the Soviet Union.
   ``The monument will be built in Moscow. Nothing is said about any
other place. What's actually happening? We have to think about the
whole country, all the republics suffered,'' Yevtushenko said.
   In another development Tuesday, officials said Nobel Peace Prize
winner and human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov is being
considered for a new Congress of People's Deputies, a national
parliamentary body of 2,250 people that for the first time will
include representatives from political and social organizations, as
well as those elected by geographic districts.
   Nominations for the March 26 elections began Monday.
   Officials said a Monday meeting at the Institute of the World
Economy nominated Sakharov for consideration at the next level, a
meeting of the Academy of Sciences.

   Soviet authorities are planning New Year's and
Christmas celebrations in Leninakan to help earthquake survivors
recover from depression over the loss of their families and homes,
Tass said Tuesday.
   ``People's mood continues to be very depressed,'' the official
Soviet news agency said. ``They have witnessed so much suffering and
have lived through so many personal tragedies.''
   Officials estimate that 40,000 to 55,000 people died in the Dec.
7 earthquake in the Armenian republic. Virtually everyone in the
area lost a relative.
   A snowstorm on Sunday night, combined with continuing problems
with transport into the disaster area, hampered food deliveries into
the cities of Spitak, Leninakan and dozens of stricken villages, the
newspaper Izvestia said Tuesday.
   In attempt to alleviate the pain and restore a sense of
normality, authorities have restored radio and television
broadcasting in the area, and schools will soon open again for the
10,000 children still in Leninakan, Tass said.
   ``Christmas-tree holidays will be organized for them and New Year
presents will be given,'' Boris Shcherbina, deputy chairman of the
Council of Ministers and a member of the commission directing
earthquake relief, told Tass.
   Some factories are reopening, and people who cannot be placed in
their former jobs will be given training for new jobs and continue
to receive their former wages for six months, Tass said.
   Recovery of dead bodies is nearing an end, with an estimated 400
remaining to pulled out, Shcherbina told Tass. Rescuers found 8,000
survivors under the rubble in Leninakan and 10,800 corpses, he said.
   Authorities plan to start rebuilding the city with satellite
residential areas, Shcherbina said.
   However, thousands of tons of supplies pouring into the disaster
area are piling up on railroad tracks because authorities have been
unable to unload rail cars as quickly as they arrive, Izvestia said.
   On Dec. 25, 1,800 rail cars full of relief supplies arrived in
Armenia, but only 1,423 were unloaded, the newspaper said.
   Sunday's snowstorm closed roads into the area, and Izvestia said
disorganization worsened the situation. No one spread sand or salt
on the roads, and no one cleared the snow from the worst sections of
the twisting mountain highways, it said.
   Soviet authorities have come under considerable criticism for
lack of organization in the quake relief efforts, but many of the
area's leaders died or wandered in shock for days after crawling out
of the rubble to find their families gone.
   Soviet TV broadcast a special program on the earthquake Tuesday
night that emphasized the aid pouring into Armenia from across the
Soviet Union and the world.
   The cameras focused on the haunted eyes of children, a woman
crying over the corpse of a man, and long, low aerial footage of
acres of rubble.

   A military court convicted two ethnic
Albanian soldiers on charges of organizing a terrorist group to
fight for the rights of their minority, an official report said
Tuesday.
   The court in Sarajevo, capital of the republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, convicted Rasim Salihu and sentenced him to 5{
years in prison, the state-run Tanjug news agency said. The second
soldier, Sejran Hadziju, received a prison sentence of 2{ years,
Tanjug said.
   The military tribunal said the two conscripts had organized an
illegal group of ethnic ``Albanian extremists and separatists''
during their compulsory army service, according to Tanjug.
   The report said the group had planned to stage terrorist actions
in their army barracks.
   Most ethnics Albanians come from the southern Yugoslav province
of Kosovo, which for years has been plagued by tensions between its
90 percent Albanian majority and the Slav minority.
   About 30,000 Serbs and Montenegrins _ who are Slavs _ reportedly
have left the economically backward region since 1981, when Albanian
extremists organized riots to demand greater autonomy. The Albanians
say the Serbs, who claim Kosovo as their medieval heartland, are
persecuting them and denying them equal rights as Yugoslav citizens.
   In another incident Tuesday, six ethnic Albanians were arrested
on the Yugoslav-Austrian border while trying to smuggle into
Yugoslavia five automatic rifles and a large quantity of ammunition,
Tanjug reported.
   Yugoslavia, which has about 20 different ethnic groups, is a
communist federation of six republics and two autonomous provinces
formed after World War II.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Tuesday's auction to the highest levels in almost
four years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 8.22 percent, up from 8.14 percent last
week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 8.33 percent, up from 8.29 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 8.41
percent on March 25, 1985 and six-month bills averaged 8.56 percent
on April 8, 1985.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.51 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,792.20 and and 8.82 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,578.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 9.0 percent last
week after averaging 9.10 percent the week before.

   A police academy class whose first week of
training resulted in the death of one cadet and the hospitalization
of 14 others graduates Wednesday, but a dispute lingers over who
will pay their medical bills.
   The state has agreed to cover the costs of the cadet who died,
but has balked at covering what some estimate are up to $500,000 in
bills resulting from the illness of the other 14. Town and city
officials maintain the state should pay, since it ran the training
program.
   An investigation into the November death of Cadet Timothy Shepard
of complications from heat stroke resulted in a reform of the school
and its strict training methods.
   The state offered to pay for the $250,000 liver transplant that
Shepard, of Pittsfield, underwent a week after his Sept. 19
collapse. But Michael Lelyveld, spokesman for state Secretary of
Administration and Finance Frank Keefe, said the state has not made
a specific policy for reimbursement for the other cadets.
   The institute has undergone a major overhaul since nearly
one-third of the class of 50 was hospitalized for dehydration and
exhaustion. In addtion, several cadets received further treatment
for and muscle damage they suffered from their first week at the
school in September.
   The head of the agency has resigned and several other top
staffers have left. Recommendations from a board of experts
appointed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to reshape the Criminal Justice
Training Center are expected in the next few weeks.
   ``I do not expect in any way, shape or form that the property-tax
payers of Chicopee should have to pay for this,'' Mayor Joseph
Chessey said of the estimated $30,000 cost of treating two city
cadets. ``We sent our recruits there in good shape. I feel it is a
problem of the state and not the city.''
   Earlier this month, state Sen. Peter Webber filed a bill that
would reimburse cities and towns for costs not covered by insurance.

   Two men who were trapped under 6 feet of
snow for seven hours after an avalanche said Tuesday they feared
they would suffocate, but one said his love of skiing kept him going.
   The two Durango men, Brett Woods, 24, and Keith Cathcart, 19,
were buried in the avalanche for seven hours on Christmas. They said
they survived because they remained calm and managed to pound air
pockets in the snow with their heads and hands.
   The pair was rescued after two people out walking heard their
screams and spotted Woods' blue glove sticking out of a snow slide
just 10 feet from the road.
   ``As soon as we hit, I thought I was going to die,'' said
Cathcart on Tuesday from his hospital bed at Mercy Medical Center.
He and Woods were listed in satisfactory condition, recovering from
hypothermia and muscle injuries.
   ``We wanted to see what the town looked like on Christmas all
covered with snow. I do it every year,'' said Woods from his
hospital bed.
   Woods and Cathcart apparently set off the slide as they walked
near the top of the Chapman Hill ski area at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday.
Both said they were unaware of avalanche warnings that had been
issued after a heavy snowfall in the region.
   They rode the first slide down, but a second avalanche apparently
buried them at the bottom of the hill before they could get up.
   ``I panicked massively for a minute,'' said Woods. ``I thought I
was going to suffocate.''
   But he managed to calm down and begin digging for air, he said.
   Both were dressed in several layers of winter gear, boots, hats
and gloves and did not suffer from the cold, but they said they were
unconscious at least half the time they were buried.
   ``I kept thinking I didn't want to suffocate on Christmas. I
don't know what kept me going. I guess that I want to go skiing,''
Woods said.
   After many hours, they heard footsteps and shouted for help and
were rescued.
   Andy Loving of the Avalanche Information Center in Denver said
nine hours is the longest anyone has survived buried in an avalanche
in the United States. In Canada, he said, someone survived snow
burial for 22 hours.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias clashed in
street battles Tuesday in the southern slums of the capital,
shattering a 10-day-old truce sponsored by Syrian forces.
   Earlier Tuesday, police said four gunmen were killed in a
shootout between rival Druse Moslem groups in central Lebanon, and a
Palestinian guerrilla official was assassinated in the southern port
of Sidon over the Christmas weekend.
   Police said gunmen of the mainstream Amal militia fought rival
Hezbollah, or Party of God, members with mortars, rocket-propelled
grenades and machine guns in south Beirut's Mesharrifieh and Bir
El-Abed districts.
   Police said they had no immediate reports of casualties from the
fighting.
   Staccato bursts of gunfire and mortar blasts echoed across the
city as the fighting flared after nightfall between the two factions
that have long been vying for dominance of Lebanon's Shiites.
   Amal, Arabic for hope, is allied with Syria while Hezbollah is
backed by Iran. A six-day fight in late November left at least 40
people dead and gunfights have erupted periodically since then.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for pro-Iranian
extremist factions holding most of the 15 Western hostages missing
in Lebanon. The captives are believed imprisoned in a Hezbollah
barracks in Hay Madi near Bir El-Abed.
   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a
12-year-old Arab League peacekeeping mandate.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, marking the ninth
anniversary of the Soviet military move into Afghanistan, predicted
Tuesday that the Afghan army would fall apart after the Soviet
troops were withdrawn.
   Despite the introduction of Backfire bombers and other new
weapons by the Soviets, the U.S.-armed resistance made sizable gains
throughout the year, the anniversary report said.
   As a result, the Afghan army is a ``demoralized force'' suffering
shortages of qualified officers and manpower, despite forced
conscriptions and bribes of tribal militia, the report said. ``Most
experts agree that it probably can survive no more than a matter of
months after a complete Soviet withdrawal.''
   The Soviets had an estimated 110,000 to 115,000 troops in the
country supporting a pro-Moscow government against rebels armed by
the United States through Pakistan.
   Half the troops were withdrawn by mid-August, in compliance with
an accord signed last April by Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the
remaining half is supposed to leave by next Feb. 15.
   Meanwhile, President Reagan repeated in a statement issued during
his California vacation that he expected the Soviets to adhere to
that commitment despite their suspension of the withdrawal early
last month.
   Still, Reagan's statement said, ``the introduction of new
weapons, and the escalation in the use of Soviet warplanes in
bombing raids against Afghanistan call into question the Soviet
commitment to a peaceful solution.''
   In a reversal of policy, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli
Vorontsov met this month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, with Burhanuddin
Rabbani, chairman of an alliance of Afghan rebels.
   The meeting was held over the strong objections of the Kabul
government, which feared the Soviets might reach an independent
agreement with the rebels, the report said.
   The Soviets ``now appear ready to explore all options that could
lead to a political settlement,'' the report said without
elaboration.
   It disclosed that the Soviets had held unpublicized meetings in
Europe with representatives of a rebel group before the Taif talks.
   At least 300 Soviet troops are missing in action and some may be
held by the rebels, the report said.
   The main decision reached so far in the talks between Vorontsov
and the guerrilla leaders was to continue the meetings, and ``we are
expecting a followup any day now,'' Robert Flaten, head of the State
Department's office of Afghan affairs, told reporters Tuesday.
   The United States supports meetings between the Afghan resistance
and the Soviets in the hope that it will lead to an agreement that
``could save lots of lives,'' Flaten said.
   The Taif talks were followed by ``a significant reduction in the
intensity'' of guerrilla activity, with fewer attacks against
cities. But ``for inexplicable reasons, the Soviets have not
responded'' and have continued the war at a brutal level, with
attacks by the recently introduced Backfire bombers, he said.
   Top officials of the communist government in Kabul may eventually
leave the country, Flaten said in answer to questions.
   After nine years of fighting, the Afghan people can identify
``the people they consider to have sold out their country ... whom
they consider traitors, criminals, war criminals or whatever,'' and
will deal with them, Flaten said.
   But this will affect ``a fairly thin level of senior people ...
the average guy working in a ministry is not threatened,'' he
continued.

   A man who confessed to arranging
the killing of a widely known ecologist is only trying to protect
his father, who was angry at the victim's campaign to save the
Amazon, a union leader charged Tuesday.
   Osmarino Rodrigues, leader of the Rubber Tappers Union in the
remote jungle town of Brasileia, 2,660 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro, made the allegation on Rio's private radio station Jornal

   Darcy Pereira, 21, told police he hired a professional killer to
murder ecologist Francisco Mendes, who was shot to death Dec. 22 at
his home about 50 miles from Brasileia.
   Rodrigues said Pereira's cattle rancher father, Darli Alves da
Silva, and the entire family has fled since Pereira turned himself
in Monday.
   ``We believe that he (Pereira) is being used by his family to
cloud the identity of the real gunmen,'' Rodrigues said on Jornal do
Brasil. ``The da Silva family has disappeared, fled. One member of
the family is trying to save the rest.''
   Police superintendent Mauro Sposito on Tuesday told The
Associated Press by telephone from Rio Branco that Pereira was being
questioned. He would not elaborate.
   Police were searching the area for Alves da Silva and his
brother, Alvarinho Alves da Silva, also suspected in the killing,
Sposito said.
   Sposito said police also were questioning a witness who claimed
to have seen two gunmen fleeing the scene of the crime. The witness
was being held at police headquarters, the police chief said.
   Mendes, 44, widely known for leading a campaign against
destruction of the Amazon jungle, said he had received repeated
death threats from the Alves da Silva brothers for organizing
demonstrations against deforestation of the jungle by cattle
ranchers.
   The issue of how to develop the Amazon, an expanse of rain forest
about two-fifths the size of the continental United States, has
often erupted in violence.
   Land disputes involving landless peasant farmers, ecologists,
members of the progressive wing of the Roman Catholic Church and
cattle ranchers and developers have resulted in about 250 deaths a
year since 1985.

   The Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 that tore open at
31,000 feet had 27 prior problems in the last five years, including
seven previous unscheduled landings, according to the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   The record, however, FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said Tuesday, is
not out of line. ``The rate those airplanes are flown, I don't think
that's much at all.''
   The Eastern 727 had 51,194 cycles, or takeoffs and landings,
which ``is getting up there,'' he said. But he noted the Aloha
Airlines 737 that lost its roof at 24,000 feet last April had more
than 90,000 cycles. One person died in that incident and 61 people
were injured. Two people were slightly injured when the 727's cabin
lost pressure Monday.
   The FAA service difficulty report for Eastern 727 N8148-N listed
these prior unscheduled landings in the last five years:
   _No date. Loss of system A hydraulic quantity and tank pressure.
Find system A pressurization module failed.
   _No date. Lost A hydraulic system fluid during retraction.
   _June 10, 1986. Unable to maintain pressurization in cruise, made
emergency descent to 15,000 feet and pressurization was controlled.
Made unscheduled landing.
   _April 1, 1986. No. 1 engine experienced a compressor stall,
opened pneumatic bleeds and stall did not repeat.
   _March 25, 1986. One engine's oil quantity dropped to 1.5 gallons
during takeoff, found engine's oil tank cap O-ring distorted.
   _March 18, 1986. Left main gear door failed to retract.
   _No date. Windshield cracked.
   Farrar, speaking by telephone from Washington, D.C., said of the
list, ``Nothing I saw there would qualify as an emergency.''
   There was one other incident of an emergency descent, which was a
matter of getting the plane to a safe altitude, he said. ``That is
different from an emergency landing.''
   The unscheduled landings averaged out to ``a little more than one
each year,'' he said. ``Most of those were precautionary, good
judgment things. I don't call that out of the ordinary.''
   The plane is at least 20 years old, but Farrar did not know
exactly when it was built. Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman
David Jimenez, reached at home, said he also was unable to say how
old the plane is since Boeing is closed this week for its holiday
break.
   Asked about number of unscheduled landings, Jimenez said, ``What
you're suggesting here doesn't seem out of the ordinary.'

   America's greeting card to the Soviet Union,
which an Iowa businessman hopes will bear 2 million signatures by
week's end, gathered only a few dozen names during a brief stop here
Tuesday.
   The scroll-like card, which has about 30,000 names on it, looked
somewhat dog-eared when it was unrolled on Fountain Square Plaza.
The scroll was taken down after less than an hour because of high
wind. Among the signers were some policemen and Cincinnati Vice
Mayor Peter Strauss.
   ``Greetings from the people of Cincinnati to my friends in
Russia,'' Strauss wrote.
   ``We got some tears but we made repairs. It's fine,'' said Louis
Bolster, who designed the 42-by-12-foot greeting card Iowa
businessman James Lawlor intends to send on Saturday to the Soviet
Union.
   The card later was taken to City Hall in Columbus, where it
remained for two hours. The mayor of Columbus was not in his office
Tuesday.
   The tour originated in Chicago on Monday and was supposed to stop
in Indianapolis, but heavy snow wiped that leg of the trip off the
planned eight-city tour.
   Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer was the first to sign the card in
that city. He wrote, ``Merry Christmas and God Bless,'' and declared
the card ``a tremendous idea.''
   The group's car hit a wall on a snowy ramp in Chicago, but no one
was injured and the group continued westward, said Janet Emard,
assistant director of the project.
   Lawlor, who owns a safety goggle manufacturing company in
Fairfield, Iowa, said he woke up Dec. 1 with an idea of sending ``a
message of peace ... from one superpower to another.''
   He had the card made. It says, in Russian: ``Dear Mr. (Soviet
leader Mikhail) Gorbachev, We citizens of the United States of
America wish to extend to you and the people of the Soviet Union our
great appreciation for your courage and dedication in bringing peace
to the world. Merry Christmas.''
   Under the Russian Orthodox church calendar, Christmas is
celebrated on Jan. 7, but the main winter holiday in the Soviet
Union is New Year's Day.
   Lawlor has affixed to the card some 30,000 signatures that
arrived by mail from around the country, including those of
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and
singer Barbra Streisand.
   The group, Lawlor said, plans to finish the tour at the Soviet
Embassy in Washington.
   Pan American Airlines has donated a plane to fly the greeting
card to Moscow. Holiday Inn is providing lodging for the truck
driver and others in Lawlor's party.
   The project, according to Lawlor, will cost about $50,000.
   Other cities on the tour include Columbus, Pittsburgh, New York,
Philadelphia and Washington.

<HEAD>Opposition Questions Legality of Sending Police Commandos To Quell
Riot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition legislators Tuesday questioned the
legality of sending Mexico City police commandos to crush a prison
riot 500 miles away, and a congressional committee was assigned to
investigate.
   At least five inmates may have been killed after surrendering at
the end of a two-day uprising at Venustiano Carranza penitentiary in
Nayarit province. Twenty other people also died in the riot.
   ``This is not called crime-fighting. This is called criminal
government that does not observe the law,'' Federico Ruiz Lopez of
the opposition conservative National Action Party shouted during
heated debate in the Chamber of Deputies.
   The chamber passed by acclamation a resolution to have its
Justice and Government Committee investigate whether the decision by
Nayarit Gov. Celso Humberto Delgado Ramirez to call in the commandos
was warranted.
   During the debate, opposition legislators said the very existence
of the special commando units was unconstitutional because no law
authorizes them.
   Deputy Salvador Sanchez Vasquez said the decision by the
governor, a fellow member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, was legal and covered by a police cooperation and extradition
agreement among Mexico's 31 states and the Federal District
government.
   Nayarit Deputy Ernesto Rivera of the opposition Popular Socialist
Party supported the governor.
   ``It was a scandal for Nayarit, but I feel he handled it in the
most intelligent manner possible,'' Rivera said in a telephone
interview. ``Sometimes it is necessary to use these types of
instruments to return control to the state.''
   Nayarit Attorney General Rodolfo Leon announced in Tepic, the
state capital, that he was launching an investigation into the
deaths of the five inmates.
   Efforts to reach Delgado Ramirez on Tuesday, who was in Mexico
City meeting with federal officials, were unsuccessful. But his
spokesman in Tepic, Francisco Flores, said the governor had the
approval of the state legislature to bring in the special forces.
   ``The governor said from the very beginning that the the
fundamental goal was to rescue the hostages alive and that goal was
accomplished,'' Flores said. ``There was no other option.''
   The uprising began Dec. 22 when a small group of inmates, angry
because they were denied Christmas pardons for good behavior,
stormed the warden's office and took 19 people hostage.
   Warden Samuel Alvarado was shot in the leg and bled to death.
   The Fox and Scorpion special commando teams flew in from Mexico
City the following day. Fox team commander Juan Armando Duarte
Badillo was shot and killed when he tried to talk the mutineers into
surrendering.
   State officials at first said police squads stormed the
penitentiary with tear gas and gunfire twice on Friday night and 19
prisoners died in the two gunfights.
   But after The Associated Press reported that a television
videotape showed 13 prisoners being questioned about their
identities by armed policemen, officials admitted there was only one
assault.
   On the videotape five of the prisoners could be heard giving
their names and all five names appeared on a list of dead released a
few hours later by the governor's office.
   The five were Benjamin Gambero Anzaldo, Jose Luis Parra Leyva,
Arturo Torres Casillas, Ricardo Hermosillo Guzman, and Enedino de la
Cruz Simon.
   Witnesses confirmed to reporters that a number of inmates listed
dead had surrendered to police. Some witnesses said that after the
riot had been over for several hours they heard shots in a part of
the prison where some inmates later were found dead.
   Flores and other state officials at first said they had no
knowledge of the discrepancy and could not explain how the prisoners
could have died in custody. A sixth inmate, Jose Martinez Palafox,
was listed as dead but identified as having been captured alive by
freed hostage Patricia Castillo.
   Another freed hostage, Brenda Margarita Rubio, said inmates had
surrendered. Castillo and Rubio are clerks in the penitentiary.

   Officials on Tuesday reviewed the
investigation into the killing of a black man by a white police
officer, but a civil rights activist wants an independent probe to
make sure there is no coverup.
   Michael D. Moore, 27, was shot to death Friday night by rookie
Officer James Marble, 32, during a scuffle outside a convenience
store, authorities said. The officer reported seeing Moore through
the store's front windows trying to stuff merchandise into his
pants. Police said a fight broke out when the officer confronted
Moore.
   Police Chief Walter Tucker said Tuesday the department's
investigation into the shooting was complete and that the findings
had been submitted to a review board consisting of himself, two
shift commanders, two detectives, two city prosecutors and the
city's equal employment opportunity officer.
   Tucker said the board's goal was to determine the facts of the
case and not to assign responsibility. He said the panel's findings
would be turned over to Mayor Jimmy Kemp for further action.
   Obie Clark, president of the Meridian chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he had
little faith in the investigation and the review board.
   ``We can just about predict what they are going to do. They've
been covering stuff up,'' he said.
   But Stewart Murphy, spokesman for the FBI in Jackson, said no
request had been made of the FBI to investigate the shooting. He
declined to speculate on whether the FBI would get involved later.
   In the past, federal officers have become involved when a
shooting involves possible civil rights violations.
   Witnesses reportedly told police that Moore aggressively
assaulted Marble to avoid being arrested. He was not armed, however,
the reports said. Police accounts said Marble, an officer for 10
months, fired his service revolver at Moore, hitting him in the
chest.
   A Meridian radio station reported that Moore had been shot three
times. Lauderdale County Coroner Marl Cobler said, however, that the
results of an autopsy performed Saturday were not being released.
   Moore initially was to go to Matty Hersee Hospital, a
state-supported charity facility, when the ambulance crew was told
by radio that no physician was available there. The ambulance
changed direction and went to Riley Memorial Hospital, a private
facility. Moore died less than two hours after the shooting, police
said.
   Kemp said Marble had been placed on administrative duty until the
review board completes its work and makes its recommendations.
   The mayor said the city would cooperate in any independent
investigation of the shooting. ``We'd be more than glad to furnish
them with any information,'' he said.

   A storm system that dumped up to a half-foot of snow on Missouri
Tuesday also shot temperatures into the 60s throughout the Ohio
Valley. Snow fell in northern California and temperatures were below
freezing in the northern and central Plains.
   Snow also covered the eastern portion of Upper Michigan. Sault
Ste. Marie received 5 inches of snow between midnight Monday and 11
a.m. Tuesday, leaving 15 inches on the ground.
   Up to 6 inches of snow fell at Nevada, Mo., with 4 inches
reported at Joplin and 3 inches at Columbia and Boonville. In
southeast Kansas, about 3 inches fell at Pittsburg; in northeast
Oklahoma, 2 inches of snow fell at Miami and Tulsa.
   The system's strong southerly winds from the Gulf of Mexico
warmed an area across the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys to the Great
Lakes. Pittsburgh, Pa., had a reading of 60 degrees.
   The southerly winds brought rainshowers from the lower Ohio
Valley into southern Michigan. Showers and thunderstorms developed
over eastern Texas and Louisiana.
   On the West Coast, rain and snow fell over much of northern
California. Redding had 2 to 3 inches of snow; snow also fell in the
Sacramento area and at Modesto. Ukiah had 2 inches of snow in an
hour, and snow fell just north of San Francisco at an elevation of
1,000 feet.
   Strong northerly winds kept wind chills as low as 40 degrees
below zero from western Minnesota across the Dakotas to much of
Wyoming and Montana. Mid-ay temperatures were below zero over
portions of the northern and central Rockies and the Intermountain
region. Record low temperatures were set in Nevada.
   Heavier precipitation during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included almost an inch at Crescent City, Calif., and around
seven-tenths of an inch at Chicago, Harrison, Ark., and Eureka,
Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees below zero at Williston, N.D., Glasgow, Mont., and Jackson,
Wyo., to 84 degrees at Sarasota, Fla., and at Harlingen, Beeville
and Kingsville, all in Texas.
   The low in the nation Tuesday morning was 25 degrees below zero
at Craig, Colo.
   Wednesday's forecast calls for rain from New England across the
mid-Atlantic states to the Ohio Valley and from the Tennessee Valley
to the Gulf Coast of Alabama and northwest Florida.
   Snow will fall over Michigan, with snowshowers scattered over
Montana, the Intermountain region and much of interior Washington
and Oregon. Northern Oregon and the Washington coast will have rain.
   High temperatures will be in the single digits and teens from the
upper Mississippi Valley across Minnesota, Iowa and the Dakotas to
eastern Montana. Temperatures will climb into the 50s and lower 60s
from southern New England across the mid-Atlantic states, the
Tennessee Valley and the Gulf Coast to southern Texas and from the
desert Southwest to Southern California. Highs will be between 65
and 70 degrees along the south Atlantic Coast, with highs in the 70s
and 80s over Florida.

   Country music star Johnny Cash is
improving from heart surgery despite lung complications over the
weekend, hospital officials said.
   Cash, 56, known as ``the man in black,'' remains in intensive
care following double-bypass surgery Dec. 19.
   ``He did have some pulmonary problems early in the weekend,''
said Baptist Hospital spokeswoman Debbie Koch. ``But he was joking
with hospital staff and seemed in good spirits.''
   Another hospital spokeswoman, Aileen Katcher, said doctors would
not release more specific information about Cash's weekend setback.
   ``The only thing more I can say is that he had problems with his
lungs,'' she said. ``The doctor says it doesn't happen to all
(bypass) patients, but it's not unusual.
   ``He is up and walking around. He's doing well.''
   Dr. Robert Hardin said Cash is stable and improving. The singer
is expected to remain hospitalized through the week.
   Cash is known for his songs ``A Boy Named Sue,'' ``I Walk the
Line'' and ``Ring of Fire.''

   Two young men who died when one shot the other and
then turned the gun on himself ``loved each other like brothers,''
friends and relatives said Tuesday.
   Tim Rhea, 19, and Jerry Apodaca, 21, were at a party and
discussing whether a gun could be knocked from an assailant's hand
before the weapon could be fired when they died Monday in an
apparent shooting-suicide, police said.
   ``I don't know if Jerry shot Tim out of reflex or what, but they
loved each other like brothers,'' said Chip Linde, 17, who was at
the party along with two others.
   ``I think when (Apodaca) saw what he did, he couldn't handle it,
and that's when he killed himself,'' Linde said.
   Rhea's father, Earl Rhea, said his son and Apodaca had a
friendship ``just about as close as you can be with a friend.''
   ``They never had any problems,'' said Rhea, describing the
shooting as ``just a freak accident.''
   Rhea was taken to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas,
where he was pronounced dead at 4:57 a.m.
   Apodoca and Rhea ``were talking about whether you could kick a
gun out of somebody's hand before they had time to shoot,'' said
homicide detective Robert McLeod.
   Police said Apodaca had brought a .45-caliber automatic pistol to
the party. Rhea, who had studied karate, apparently kicked at the
gun, ``but it was not an angry-type thing: They were just playing,''
said homicide Sgt. Jerry King.
   Authorities said the gun accidentally discharged and a bullet
struck Rhea. Apodaca then dialed 911 for assistance and spoke to a
dispatcher before turning the weapon on himself, authorities said.

   The Senate opened debate Tuesday on the U.S.-Canada
free trade pact, and lawmakers from the opposition Liberal Party
said they would keep their promise to make it law but not without
extensive scrutiny.
   Passage is virtually assured in the Liberal-dominated Senate.
   ``Even though we intend to acquiesce and the bill will become
law, our concerns have not disappeared,'' said Allan MacEachen,
leader of the opposition in the Senate. ``Large gaping holes exist.
Critical points still need to be negotiated.''
   The bill eliminates trade barriers between the United States and
Canada over a 10-year period.
   The House of Commons approved the bill 141-111 on Saturday.
   The Liberals, who hold 57 of the 98 occupied Senate seats, have
promised to allow the bill to pass by Friday, providing for its
implementation on schedule Jan. 1. The bill already passed the U.S.
Congress.
   Liberal leader John Turner held up the pact in Canada's Senate
earlier this year, saying that if Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
Progressive Conservatives won a majority in national elections, the
bill could proceed.
   Mulroney, who signed the free trade bill with President Reagan in
January, was re-elected with a majority Nov. 21.
   The bill must pass through two Senate readings, then go to a
committee for a couple of days before the vote. MacEachen said
Liberal senators plan to ask many questions when the bill goes to
the committee stage.
   ``People will look back on this and say it was a good day for
Canada,'' Mulroney told reporters Saturday after the House of
Commons approval.
   The Liberals and New Democrats voted against the legislation,
saying it will cost Canada jobs and erode the country's sovereignty.
   Mulroney said the bill will bring Canada prosperity.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 400 people died in traffic accidents on the
nation's highways over the Christmas weekend, authorities said.
   Snow and icy roads hampered drivers in the upper Midwest, but
statistics show states with warmer climates reported more traffic
fatalities.
   Figures compiled by The Associated Press show at least 387 people
died on the nation's roads from Friday night through midnight Monday.
   California reported 58 highway deaths, Florida 41 and Texas 33.
   The Chicago-based National Safety Council had estimated between
350 and 450 traffic deaths over the Christmas weekend. Last year 389
people died, the council said.
   Council statistician Barbara Carraro said the states showing
higher fatality numbers have large populations with more people
likely to drive when the roads are in good condition.
   ``In the warmer climates, more people are out traveling, and in
the severe weather, not as many people were out,'' she said.
   Minnesota, which got up to a foot of snow in the north Monday,
reported only one traffic fatality over the weekend. Illinois, which
also had a foot of snow in some suburbs, had nine fatalities.
Indiana had 16.
   During a normal non-holiday weekend in December, an estimated 380
people die in road accidents, Ms. Carraro said.
   The council projected the New Year's weekend road toll also would
be between 350 and 450.

   A spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the British

explosion.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with British custom.
   No claim of responsibility was made, but suspicion fell on the

   A Briton jailed in Iran for more than two years
arrived home Tuesday, marking the latest thaw in relations since the
two nations virtually cut diplomatic ties in 1987.
   Nicholas Nicola smiled as he walked down the steps of a scheduled
Iran Air flight at London's Heathrow Airport. He did not speak to
reporters and was taken away in a car by his father, who met him
with Foreign Office officials.
   ``We were absolutely taken by surprise,'' said a Foreign Office
spokesman who asked not to be identified. ``We're pleased and we
look forward to the same thing happening with Roger Cooper.''
   However, there was no word on the possible release of Cooper, a
businessman who speaks fluent Farsi and has lived in Iran for more
than 20 years.
   In what appears to be a more complex case, Cooper, 52, has been
accused of spying _ a charge not levied at Nicola.
   Iranian officials say Nicola, a 23-year-old tourist traveling by
land from Pakistan, was arrested on the Iranian border with firearms
in September 1986. Some Iranian reports say he shot at lights at an
Iranian border post.
   Britain said Nicola was held without trial in Tehran's maximum
security Evin Prison, where Cooper also is jailed.
   But the English-language Tehran Times reported Tuesday that
Nicola was tried and sentenced to a 3{-year prison term ``for the
possession of two weapons and a number of cartridges.'' It said the
sentence was reduced for good behavior.
   Nicola was handed over Monday to British Charge d'Affaires Gordon
Pirie, who reopened the British Embassy on Dec. 9.
   ``The family was very pleased to have him back and they were very
emotional about it,'' his uncle, Avraam Christou, said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
   Britain withdrew all its diplomats in Tehran and only one Iranian
envoy remained in London after a dispute which began when British
police arrested an Iranian envoy on shoplifting charges May 1987.
Iranian Revolutionary Guards then kidnapped and beat up a British
diplomat.
   Britain has accused Iran of breaching the Vienna Convention by
allowing only one visit by a British diplomat to Nicola and Cooper.
   Improved Anglo-Iranian relations have raised modest hopes for
British hostages believed held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.
   Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, 49, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987,
while seeking the release of American hostages in Lebanon and
journalist John McCarthy, 32, was abducted April 17, 1986.
   Islamic kidnappers claim to have killed a third missing Briton,
Alec Collett, 64, who was seized March 25, 1985. His body was never
found, however.
   Fifteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon. Besides the three
Britons, they include nine Americans, an Irishman with dual British
nationality, an Italian and a Belgian. The longest-held hostage is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Hundreds of weary travelers who spent the night at
O'Hare International Airport waited in long lines for flights
Tuesday, as the nation's busiest airport struggled to recover from
its first major winter storm.
   Additional flight delays occurred Tuesday, as the area received
more snow. Downtown Chicago and O'Hare recorded accumulations of 3
inches of snow after Monday's storm, and 2 to 4 more inches was
expected.
   Elsewhere, parts of the northern California coast that hadn't
seen any significant snowfall in 12 years got a dusting Tuesday,
causing a pileup of more than 30 cars, worrying citrus growers and
forcing the homeless into shelters. Snow fell as far south as 30
miles south of San Jose, with 6 inches accumulating in part of
Mendocino County.
   Utah, which was hammered Christmas Day by a storm that dumped up
to 2 feet of snow in the northern mountains, was locked in a deep
freeze Tuesday, as were Colorado, Wyoming and Nevada. Ice and fog
combined to trigger a 50-car rush-hour pileup on Interstate 215 just
south of Salt Lake City, and 15 people suffered minor injuries,
authorities said.
   In Nevada, the mercury dropped early Tuesday to minus 27 at Wild
Horse Reservoir in the northeast part of the state and read only 19
in Las Vegas. In Reno, the body of a homeless man was found frozen
to death Monday. The Western cold snap was expected to continue
until the weekend.
   Farther east, snow peppered parts of central and northeastern
Oklahoma as a winter storm moved through the state, keeping police
busy with minor auto accidents.
   Michigan and northern Indiana, which also were struck by the
Midwestern storm, had rain and warm temperatures wash away Monday's
snow. This made it easier for motorists in Indiana to recover their
cars from a series of traffic accidents, including a massive pileup
on Interstate 69, that claimed six lives. But more snow _ up to 8
inches in some areas _ was expected as a new storm moved in to the
region.
   At O'Hare, United Airlines, the airport's biggest customer, had
delays of up to 40 minutes because of snow again Tuesday but was
running near 100 percent of its normal schedule by midafternoon,
according to United spokesman Charles Novak. However, the airline
had to cancel 165 morning flights because of problems created by the
previous day's storm.
   The airport was never officially closed Monday, but hundreds of
flights were canceled, including about 400 flights from United
alone. O'Hare is United's hub airport.
   A few more flights could be canceled Tuesday, Novak said, as the
result of an ``equipment imbalance'' in the system nationwide. Some
United planes and crews scheduled to fly out of Chicago remained in
other cities as a result of Monday's storm, he said.
   ``The benches are nice, but they ought to take out the armrests
so you can sleep,'' said a rumpled-looking Roland Stemmer of
Mukilteo, Wash., who was among the stranded passengers waiting to
get off the ground.
   Stemmer said he arrived at O'Hare from Seattle on Monday night,
missed his connection to New York and got only 2{ hours of sleep.
   ``This is my worst experience in 25 years of flying,'' declared
passenger Bill McKay of suburban Chicago. He was among 300 people
waiting to fly standby to Denver, before United added an extra
flight.
   Ryder Houston of San Francisco, who said his Tuesday morning
flight to Baltimore was canceled, walked from flight to flight,
putting his name on standby lists.
   ``I was No. 125 on one waiting list, but no one (from the list)
got on,'' he said.
   Most passengers responded ``good-naturedly'' to the wait, Novak
said.
   ``They understand we are doing everything we can to get them out
safely and on time,'' he said.
   At Chicago's Midway Airport, a spokesman for Midway Airlines said
flights were delayed a half-hour to one hour. The airline canceled
40 percent of its flights Monday, said spokesman Wayne Frantzen, but
all flights were back in service Tuesday morning and most passengers
were able to get out.
   The weather also delayed bus departures from Chicago and other
Illinois cities.
   ``I was stuck last year on Christmas Eve at the airport, so I
thought this year I'd take the bus. Wrong!'' said Jan Gabrielson of
Cincinnati, who spent several hours at Chicago's Greyhound bus
terminal while returning from a Christmas trip to Iowa.

   Thousands of turbaned Afghans piled
into buses in this frontier city at the foot of Khyber Pass and
drove to a protest rally Tuesday on the ninth anniversary of Soviet
military intervention in Afghanistan.
   This year, only one of seven top Afghan guerrilla leaders based
in Pakistan spoke at what may be the last such rally after a decade
of war.
   The rally coincided with increased Soviet diplomatic efforts for
a political settlement of the conflict.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, the most radical rebel chief, addressed the
rally at a big refugee camp on the outskirts of Peshawar, 30 miles
from the Afghan border. The anti-Marxist rebels have demonstrated
each year on Dec. 27, the date in 1979 that the Red Army marched
into Afghanistan at the invitation of the communist government in
Kabul.
   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees live in Pakistan and up
to 2 million in Iran.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, chairman of the seven-party Afghan guerrilla
alliance supported by Washington and based in Pakistan, met Tuesday
in the Iranian capital Tehran with government officials and Afghan
rebels.
   The guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, are split
into two coalitions _ the Iran-based Shiite Moslem alliance and
Rabbani's larger Sunni Moslem alliance based in Pakistan.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
English-language newspaper Tehran Times on Tuesday as reporting that
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov will fly to Tehran
soon to meet Shiite resistance leaders. It will be the first direct
contact between Moscow and the Iran-based mujahedeen since the 1979
Soviet intervention.
   Rabbani was in Iran to ensure that both coalitions present a
united front to Moscow.
   Also Tuesday, Radio Kabul said in a broadcast monitored in
Pakistan that guerrilla rocket attacks on Afghan cities over the
previous two days killed at least 28 people. The state-run radio
said Herat in western Afghanistan was hardest hit with 20 people
killed, four injured. There was no independent confirmation.
   At the Pakistan rally, Hekmatyar directed his rhetoric at his
American backers as well as the Soviet Union. Though Pakistani and
Western sources say he is one of the largest recipients of U.S.
military aid to Afghan rebels, Hekmatyar refused to acknowledge
military assistance from Washington.
   He said his weapons were captured in battle, a contention other
guerrilla leaders deny.
   The hardliner also declared, ``It seems that Moscow is reaching
an understanding with the West on one hand in a bid to prevent a
mujahedeen government in Afghanistan.''
   His speech was punctuated with audience shouts of ``Death to
Russia!'' and ``Death to America!''
   Many demonstrators belonged to Hekmatyar's fundamentalist
Hezb-e-Islami group. A sprinkling of representatives from other
mujahedeen groups attended.
   In April, Moscow agreed to pull more than 100,000 soldiers from
Afghanistan by Feb. 15 next year. Half of them left by August. The
United Nations negotiated the agreement in Geneva and it was signed
by Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the Soviet Union and the United
States acting as co-guarantors.
   The mujahedeen were not party to the accords, and the Soviets
suspended their withdrawal in the face of continuing rebel attacks.
   At the beginning of December, Vorontsov met Rabbani in Taif,
Saudi Arabia, for negotiations.
   Rabbani said earlier that Vorontsov hinted that Afghanistan's
Marxist President Najib, who goes by one name only, and his People's
Democratic Party would be sacrificed for a political settlement of
the war.
   Hekmatyar has greeted the talks with skepticism. He said Tuesday,
``Although these talks are a great political victory for the
mujahedeen, great hopes should not be pinned on such talks.''
   He assailed a Saturday meeting between Vorontsov and former King
Zahir Shah of Afghanistan, who has lived in exile in Rome since he
was ousted in a 1973 coup.
   Moderate Afghan rebel groups have supported the king's return to
head an interim government, to be replaced in time by an elected
Parliament.
   Hekmatyar also dismissed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
call for an international conference on Afghanistan, a cease-fire
and U.N. peacekeeping troops. The mujahedeen unanimously oppose the
conference because it would include representation from Kabul.
   Rabbani said Tuesday that no differences of opinion exist between
the two mujahedeen alliances, Tehran television said in a report
monitored in Cyprus.
   ``All the mujahedeen groups agree on a complete Soviet troop
withdrawal and the establishment of an Islamic government in
Kabul,'' the television quoted him as saying.
   Afghan refugees demonstrated in several Iranian cities to mark
the anniversary.
   In London on Tuesday, Soviet Embassy officials met for the first
time in Britain with representatives of two anti-communist Afghan
groups.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe meanwhile called on
the Kabul regime to step down as soon as possible to avoid more
bloodshed.

   A group of 104 Nicaraguans who were
held prisoner in Honduras by anti-Sandinista guerrillas were rescued
and put under protection of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, a
Honduran official said Tuesday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro told The Associated
Press the 96 men and eight women now were in a refugee camp in
eastern El Paraiso province, near the Nicaraguan border. They
included some soldiers from the Sandinista army, he said in an
interview.
   All were ``held illegally in Honduran territory by the Nicaraguan
Resistance,'' Castro said.
   The Nicaraguan Resistance is a coalition of U.S.-supported groups
of rebels, known as Contras, fighting the past eight years to
overthrow Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Castro said the Nicaraguans ``were rescued in an action by our
government, which will not permit this kind of illegal capture by
armed insurgent groups inside Honduras.'' He did not say when they
were freed.
   A Contra leader, who uses the name Cmdr. Johnson, said the
Nicaraguans were simply released.
   The Contras operated with the tacit acceptance of Honduras for
many years, but U.S. support for the Contras has dwindled and
Hondurans in border areas have increasingly been protesting the
rebels' presence.
   Thousands of armed guerrillas have fled Nicaragua in the past
year, and the Honduran government has asked for help in dealing with
them and with tens of thousands of other Nicaraguan refugees.
   The Contra leader said in an interview the Nicaraguans were
captured in battle by the Contras more than a year ago.
   He said that with the release, the Nicaraguan Resistance holds no
more prisoners and that ``all those who want to return to Nicaragua
will be helped to do so and turned over to the Nicaraguan Red
Cross.''
   Castro appeared skeptical.
   ``We do not know yet if the Contras hold more prisoners in our
territory. This is being investigated by our authorities. But if
there are, they will be rescued, since we demand respect for the
sovereignty and laws of Honduras,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iran Arrests Hundreds of Drug Smugglers, Report Says</HEAD>

   Almost 900 people were arrested on drug
charges in Iran over the past several days as the country prepares
to enforce a law that provides the death penalty for drug
traffickers, the Islamic Republic News Agency said Tuesday.
   The police sweep was designed to put pressure on traffickers
before the tough new law is implemented on Jan. 21, said IRNA,
monitored in Nicosia.
   The law provides the death sentence for anyone found possessing
more than an ounce of heroin or five kilograms (11 pounds) of opium
and for any drug dealer carrying firearms or who repeatedly addicted
other people.
   In an attempt to prevent drugs from entering Iran, the government
has declared off limits to all unauthorized people a
200-kilometer-long (124-mile) strip of the southern border near
Afghanistan, the oficial agency said.
   ``No one should get near this area,'' said Mahmoud Mir-Lohi,
commander of the Islamic Revolution Committees, Iran's police. ``We
believe that drug caravans are using this area and forces stationed
there have been ordered to deal firmly with any unauthorized
personnel.''
   Mir-Lohi said police foiled 21 attempts by traffickers to enter
Iran through that area in the past two months, and 50 security posts
were set up in the eastern provinces.
   IRNA said police killed or wounded 27 drug traffickers in
gunfights since Sunday. It said the smugglers were trying to flee
into the mountains near Nasak, in southeastern Kerman province.
   It reported that 543 of those arrested recently were seized in
Khorasan province, near Afghanistan, and 250 pounds of drugs and 12
firearms were confiscated. It did not identify the types of drugs.
   An additional 346 people were arrested and more than 500 pounds
of drugs were seized elsewhere in Iran, including in Tehran, the
report said.

   A Boeing 727 forced to land after a
14-inch hole opened in its fuselage had problems maintaining cabin
pressure during the flight even before the roof ripped open, federal
officials said Tuesday.
   The crew of Eastern Airlines Flight 251 told investigators they
began having trouble shortly after takeoff Monday from Rochester,
N.Y., en route to Atlanta, said National Transportation Safety Board
spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   ``By the time they reached 31,000 feet, they were able to
stabilize the pressure,'' Lopatkiewicz said. ``They sent the second
officer back to check the doors to listen for problems. Sometime
when there's a problem with the door seals, you can usually hear it,
but he didn't hear anything.
   ``Shortly after he returned, there was the rapid
depressurization.''
   The plane, with 104 passengers and six crew members, landed at
Charleston's Yeager Airport after the roof tore open at 31,000 feet.
Two passengers were treated at a hospital for nosebleeds and
headaches caused by the sudden loss of pressure.
   On Tuesday, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-bound Eastern Airlines jet
returned to New York City's LaGuardia Airport to repair a loose door
panel that kept the cabin from pressurizing properly, an airline
spokeswoman said.
   Flight 715, an A-300 airbus carrying 210 passengers, took off at
8:45 a.m. and returned to the airport at 10:05 a.m. to have the
access door panel repaired, said Virginia Sanchez.
   Also Tuesday, Eastern mechanics inspected 17 of the 100 series
727s and 28 of the 200 series 727s, airline officials said.
   ``It's just as a precautionary measure following yesterday's
incident,'' said spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   As federal investigators began the months-long job of pinpointing
the cause of Monday's incident, they also said Tuesday that:
   _ Records for the past five years show the plane had made seven
unscheduled landings before this week, but none could be called an
emergency landing.
   _ The section of the fuselage that developed the hole was a
replacement part, not the original skin of the plane, which is about
20 years old.
   _ The piece that peeled away would be taken to a laboratory for
metallurgical tests.
   The plane was 50 miles, or a few minutes' flying time, from
Charleston when the hole opened. Passengers said they heard a pop
and felt a cold wind whipping through the cabin before oxygen masks
dropped down before them.
   The crew took the plane down to 10,000 feet, the altitude at
which oxygen masks aren't needed, before landing.
   Two NTSB representatives from Washington were in Charleston on
Tuesday to examine the plane. It could be six months before a final
determination is made on what happened, said NTSB investigator
Pamela Kleckner.
   Interviews with flight attendants revealed that the 21,000-foot
drop took no more than 90 seconds, Kleckner said.
   ``They said they were amazed and how quick it was between the
time the oxygen masks came down and the time the captain said people
could breathe normally,'' Kleckner said.
   Kleckner said the agency will test the torn piece of metal.
``It'll go back to our laboratory in Washington, our metallurgical
lab, and they'll use an electron microscope ... to pinpoint the type
of failures on the metal itself,'' she said.
   Kleckner said the NTSB also will look into complaints by some
passengers that their oxygen masks did not work.
   A 5-inch crack had been found on the fuselage of the plane in an
inspection in July 1986, and corrosion and a tiny wing crack were
found in April 1987, said Bobbie Mardis of the FAA's safety data
branch in Oklahoma City.
   Federal officials also said mechanical problems, including
failure to maintain cabin pressure, had forced the jet to land at
least seven times in the past five years.
   But Ceremsak said, ``From what I understand from what they've
pulled up on this plane, there's nothing unusual in its history.''
   Ceremsak said the jet was maintained according to FAA guidelines,
and its crown _ the top of the fuselage from the cockpit to the tail
_ was inspected in September.
   Mardis said Tuesday that it was not unusual for a plane to
develop cracks like those on the 727.
   ``Inspectors do periodic inspections, and cracks are one of the
items they look for,'' she said. ``It's part of normal wear and
tear, and we know that's going to happen. That doesn't mean they're
not serious, but that's why they look for them.''
   Lopatkiewicz said investigators determined that the section that
peeled away had been replaced, but they did not know whether it was
because of cracks.
   ``I suppose it's possible, but we don't have any information on
the maintenance and the timing on when things had been done,'' he
said.
   FAA officials in Atlanta said NTSB officials has custody of all
maintenance records, including the September inspection report.
Lopatkiewicz said the agency hasn't received the records.
   Richard Maddan, manager of the FAA office in Charleston, said he
didn't think there was any connection between the plane's previous
problems and the tear on Monday.
   ``From the preliminary information, I don't think it would be the
same as the corrosion or the rivet (problems),'' Maddan said. ``The
information I got is that it's just a hole.''

<HEAD>New Rightist Death Squad Vows to Kill Leftists In El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group identifying itself as a
new right-wing death squad has vowed to exact eye-for-an-eye revenge
for killings and car bombings by leftists, according to a communique.
   ``The only way to achieve the total extermination of this horde
of terrorist killers is by the same means and with the same force
they use,'' said the communique issued by a group calling itself the
Revolutionary Anti-Communist Exterminating Action, or ARDE.
   The communique was delivered to media outlets over the weekend,
and several radio stations began broadcasting it Tuesday.
   In the early 1980s, death squads regularly issued communiques
threatening individuals or leftist groups, and those threats were
frequently carried out. The last such communique was issued in June
1987.
   The group threatened to kill two leftist leaders for each person
the guerrillas kidnap or kill; to bomb the house of one leftist
leader for every car bomb; and to kill one leftist for each mayor
forced to resign under death threats from leftist guerrillas.
   It also accused the military of being unable to stop ``the
terrorist actions of these vandals.''
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a coalition of
five leftist guerrilla groups that have been fighting the government
since 1979, has set off several car bombs in San Salvador in recent
months.
   On Friday, guerrillas attacked the Defense Ministry headquarters
compound on the edge of the capital with four car bombs and
explosives, killing four people and wounding 35.
   The same day, unidentified terrorists attacked the National
University, which rightists have often accused of being a center of
leftist activity. A night watchman was killed and the biology lab
building was blown up in the attack.
   Guerrillas have forced 18 mayors from small provincial towns to
resign during the past three months with death threats.
   The ARDE communique was dated Dec. 21 and was delivered by hand
to five newspapers and four television and six radio stations. It
said the media would ``be attacked drastically'' if they did not
publish the communique for three consecutive days.
   The communique contained a list of leftist leaders, headed by top
Liberation Front commanders Shafick Handal and Ferman Cienfuegos,
who it said would be killed in reprisals.
   It also listed among possible victims Guillermo Ungo, a candidate
in presidential elections next March for the leftist Democratic
Convergence coalition, and Ruben Zamora, his campaign coordinator.
   Both belong to the Democratic Revolutionary Front, a non-fighting
coalition of leftist parties, movements and student and labor unions
closely allied with the Liberation Front.
   Zamora, who returned to El Salvador in November 1987 after seven
years of exile, said in a telephone interview that the threats
``show that ultra-rightist sectors are desperate because we are on
the right electoral path, and we will not retreat in the face of
threats and blackmail.''
   An estimated 65,500 people have been killed since guerrillas
launched a civil war in 1979 against a succession of U.S.-supported
governments. Human rights groups say most of the victims have been
civilians, slain by leftist or rightist death squads.
   Rightist death squads, organized or tolerated by the military,
were blamed for thousands of slayings from 1980 to early 1984.
   The slayings abated in July 1984, when President Jose Napoleon
Duarte's centrist Christian Democratic administration took office
after the first free elections in El Salvador and forced the
military to sever all ties with the rightist squads.

<TEXT>
   The government confirmed Tuesday that
Cuban leader Fidel Castro has been invited to the inauguration of
President-elect Carlos Andres Perez. It would be Castro's first
visit in nearly 30 years.
   Foreign Minister German Nava Carrillo said Castro has not
responded to the invitation, contrary to previous press reports.
   ``We have sent out a general invitation to all the countries
Venezuela has relations with,'' said Nava Carrillo. Venezuela has no
formal diplomatic relations with Cuba but both countries maintain
informal contact.
   When asked if the invitation included Cuba, Nava Carrillo
answered ``Yes.''
   Rumors of Castro's visit have awakened controversy, the first for
Perez since his victory in presidential elections Dec. 4.
   ``Neither Fidel Castro or (Chilean military President) Augusto
Pinochet should be invited to Venezuela,'' said Vladimir Gessen,
ex-presidential candidate for the New Generation party, the
fourth-largest party in the country.
   ``Neither of them have anything to teach us about democracy,'' he
added.
   Perez has said he will push for normalization of relations with
Cuba, starting with Castro's presence at the inaugural ceremonies
Feb. 2.
   The Cuban leader last visited Venezuela in 1959, shortly after he
took power in Cuba.
   Cuban-Venezuelan relations cooled in the 1960s while the Caracas
government struggled to crush a Castro-backed guerrilla insurgency.
The countries cut off relations in 1980 when Cuban militant exiles
were found innocent in a Caracas court of alleged terrorist
activities against the Castro regime.
   Dozens of Latin American and European dignitaries are expected
for the inauguration, including Presidents Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador,
Raul Alfonsin of Argentina, Julio Maria Sanguinetti of Uruguay and
Felipe Gonzalez of Spain.

<HEAD>Last of `Verbal Offense' Prisoners Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The collective state presidency on
Tuesday ordered the release of the last 25 people serving prison
terms for so-called ``verbal offenses,'' state-run television
reported.
   Yugoslav intellectuals and human rights activists for years have
appealed to authorities to abolish Article 133 of the country's
penal code.
   Tuesday's move did not abolish the article, but the TV report
said no more prisoners were serving terms for such offenses.
   The article allows authorities to prosecute people for ``hostile
propaganda'' or ``verbal offenses,'' such as insulting the country's
leaders.
   Many convictions were based on comments made in private
conversations or in articles written for foreign publications. Some
people were sentenced for publicly singing songs disapproved of by
the authorities.

   Military headquarters on
Tuesday announced it has dismissed an army reserve commander who
reportedly engaged in right-wing political activity in violation of
regulations.
   Andre Malan, commander of the Outenikwa reserve unit in Cape
Province, was dismissed for breaking a ban on partisan political
activity by career military personnel, a military statement said.
   It did not elaborate on Malan's alleged activities. But Koos van
der Merwe, defense spokesman for the extreme-right Conservative
Party, said he had taken up the matter with armed forces chief Gen.
Jannie Geldenhuys.
   Malan reportedly participated in a recent Afrikaner historical
festival backed by the Conservative Party, which favors revival of
hard-line race separation laws and says President P.W. Botha's
National Party is making excessive concessions to the black majority.

<HEAD>Poland To End Gas Rationing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government plans to end gasoline
rationing on Jan. 1, the official news agency PAP said Tuesday, and
state car manufacturers announced new car prices.
   PAP said state authorities took those steps in an effort to
ensure a balance between market supply and demand.
   The agency said gasoline under the new system will cost about
$1.46 a gallon and diesel fuel about $1 a gallon.
   Poles now receive monthly gasoline ration cards based on the size
of their automobile. This entitles them to purchase a limited amount
of fuel at the official price of approximately 91 cents a gallon.
   Since June, they also have been allowed to buy gas at a
``commercial price'' of about $2.50 a gallon. Introduction of a
uniform price eliminates ``commercial'' gasoline.
   This summer Poles flocked to gas stations to fill up with
non-rationed gasoline despite the higher price.
   A Ministry of Industry official cautioned that prices will rise
if gasoline sales at the new price outstrip demand, PAP said.
   The average monthly wage in Poland is about $144.
   PAP issued a partial list of official prices to go into effect
Wednesday for the most popular cars produced in Poland. The small
Fiat 126P will cost $3,600 and the four-door Polonez $14,000.
   In practice, however, it is very difficult for Poles to obtain
cars at the official price. Cars must be bought either for dollars
or at a much higher price in zlotys.
   Because of high demand, people able to buy a car at the official
rate often resell it on the open market for double or triple what
they paid.
   On the political front, 11 representatives of five banned Polish
opposition groups began a weeklong hunger strike on Christmas Day to
protest the detention of peace activists in Poland and
Czechoslovakia, Jacek Szymanderski, a spokesman for the group, said
Tuesday.
   The hunger strikers accuse authorities of pursuing a policy of
reconciliation with society in an atmosphere of repression, a
communique released by Szymanderski said.
   Fasters include members of the independent peace group Freedom
and Peace; supporters of the outlawed free trade union movement
Solidarity; the Independent Students' Union; the Polish Socialist
Party, and Polish-Czechoslovak Solidarity.

<TEXT>
   Residents are hoping the national
attention President-elect Bush's hunting trip has brought this south
Texas town in the heart of cowboy country will translate into
economic gains.
   ``We are on hard times,'' said Jeff Latcham, general manager of
the semi-weekly Beeville Bee-Picayune in this sleepy town of about
15,000 some 20 miles from the Lazy F Ranch where Bush is hunting
quail.
   ``Ever since President Reagan ... the economy went down,'' said
Alex Acosda, owner of the Bee Club bar and lounge. ``It's terrible.''
   The Bee Club, one of several downtown saloons, is just off the
main street near an a boarded-up art deco movie theater, a pharmacy
and at least two western stores that sell cowboy boots and hats.
   Like other Texas towns, Beeville and surrounding Bee County have
been hit hard in the 1980s by flat oil and natural gas prices.
Agriculture and ranching are other mainstays of the economy.
   Joe D. Montez, the city manager who is constantly trying to
rustle up new business for his native town, wished aloud that the
Bush visit ``might bring a shotgun factory here. They could say,
`This is where Bush hunts.'''
   He conceded that possbility was remote, but added, ``The more
national exposure you get ... who knows?''
   Although Bush has hunted at the Lazy F Ranch, owned by Houston
millionaire Will Farish, for two decades, he has never visited
Beeville on the annual post-Christmas excursion, residents say.
   It was no different this trip.
   Bush, who joked that Beeville was a ``swinging place,'' remained
secluded for a second day Tuesday on the 10,000-acre ranch with the
Farishs' and James A. Baker III, his close friend and designated
secretary of state. He has no public appearances scheduled until he
leaves Thursday for a fishing trip in Alabama.
   Bush spokesman Steve Hart said the president-elect ``didn't
strike out'' on his first hunt Monday. Conditions were less than
perfect Tuesday with gusting winds, but Hart said the vice president
again had success in the scrubland although the spokesman did not
know how many birds he killed.
   While Bush was isolated, Montez and others said the presence of
more than 40 journalists accompanying Bush focused the spotlight on
Beeville.
   ``It's good for public relations,'' said Jimmy Waller, a truck
driver. ``We filled up the hotels.''
   One of them, the Best Western-Drummer's Inn on U.S. Highway 81,
served as media headquarters.
   ``Everytime he comes, we're booked up,'' said desk clerk Sandy
Gilliam.
   While the vice president has been a longtime visitor to Bee
County, he only won the 1988 presidential contest there by four
votes, Latham said.
   The county's population is about 50 percent Hispanic, while the
percentage is higher in the city. That group often votes Democratic.
   But Montez, who easily switches between English and Spanish, said
he ignored his Democratic Party allegiance this year and voted for
Bush. ``I think he is good for Texas,'' he said.
   Montez said the town could use some more federal aid, which he
said has been cut dramatically since the 1970s.
   Unemployment in the city is about 8 percent. Area officials are
trying to persuade the state to locate a new prison in the county.
   They also want more light industry and manufacturing, such as a
local factory that makes steel waste containers.
   The biggest employer is Chase Naval Air Station with about 600
civilian employees. The county also has a junior college and a Texas
A&M Agricultural Research Station.
   Nancy Martinez, 26, the mother of two children, said most people
who can't find jobs move to the big cities like Corpus Christi, 70
miles away, or go on welfare.
   ``There are no jobs right now,'' she said.
   Though the economy is not as prosperous as it was in the oil and
gas boom of the 1970s, Montez said people in Beeville have a unique
way of life.
   ``We're different down here in south Texas,'' he said. ``This is
cowboy country ... hats, boots, quail, deer, mesquite, scrub....''

<HEAD>Opposition Calls Off Dialogue With Pinochet Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition on Tuesday angrily called
off a planned dialogue with the military government of President
Augusto Pinochet after the government vetoed participation by a
leftist leader.
   The first formal dialogue in five years between the opposition
and the 15-year-old government was scheduled for Jan. 3, to discuss
constitutional changes demanded by the opposition to speed
transition to democratic rule.
   But the 17-party opposition coalition said it cannot accept
``discriminatory measures the government has tried to impose on the
country.'' It called the government's veto of Luis Maira ``a pretext
to make the scheduled dialogue fail.''
   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres, the Cabinet's chief political
official, said Monday he agreed to meet the opposition to discuss
the proposed changes.
   Caceres said, however, he would not accept any four-member
delegation named which included Maira, president of the Wide Front
of the Socialist Left, a new umbrella party that includes prominent
Communists among its members.
   Caceres said he was not ready to talk to a party ``that includes
Communists and other sectors that openly reject the country's
institutionality.''
   After a three-hour meeting Tuesday, the opposition said, ``We
have decided to cancel our request to meet Interior Minister Carlos
Caceres.''
   Maira said Caceres' move was intended ``to create a problem
within the opposition.''
   Opposition spokesman Patricio Aylwin, president of the centrist
Christian Democratic Party, said the text of proposed changes was
mailed to Caceres anyway, ``so the government cannot dodge its
responsibility to give us an answer.''
   The opposition demanded the changes after Gen. Pinochet lost an
Oct. 5 referendum in which he sought voter approval to stay in power
until 1997.
   The defeat forced him to call open presidential and congressional
elections, now set for Dec. 14, 1989.

<HEAD>Fifth Woman Identified in Series of Six Slayings, Police Said</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fifth of six women found slain
along Massachusetts highways in what police believe are related
killings has been identified as an escapee from a prison
work-release program, authorities said Tuesday.
   The victim was identified as Debra Greenlaw Perry DeMello, a
35-year-old mother of three and an escapee since June from the Adult
Correctional Institution for women in Cranston, R.I., said Thomas
Gibney, spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Ronald A.
Pina.
   The identification was made through a check of dental records and
an anonymous tip, Gibney said.
   He refused to release any information on the cause of her death
other than to say it was ``considered one in a series of six.''
   DiNitto said DeMello's last known residence was in Brockton. She
was listed as an escapee June 18 when she failed to return to the
prison from her work-release job at a Providence supply company, he
said.
   DeMello was serving a 21-month sentence issued in Providence in
1987 for one count of loitering and three counts of loitering for
prostitution, DiNitto said.
   Her body was found by a highway worker Nov. 8 along Interstate
195 in Dartmouth, one of four bodies found along that highway.
   With her identification, the names of all but one of the women
found dead along Route 140 in Freetown and along Interstate 195 are
now known. Investigators are still trying to identify a woman whose
body was found Dec. 1 along Route 140.
   ``Every time we get more information we hope we get that much
closer to a resolution,'' Gibney said. ``The investigators are not
at this point frustrated in their investigation.''
   Investigators believe one person or several working together were
responsible for the killings. They believe drugs may be the link;
the four women identified previously were heroin or cocaine addicts
with links to New Bedford drug areas.
   Four New Bedford women remain missing, and authorities have been
unable to match their dental records to the remaining body.

Inauguration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A rebel defector was quoted Tuesday as
saying pro-U.S. guerrillas plan major attacks before President-elect
George Bush's inauguration to show their military strength and get
American aid flowing again.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling Sandinistas, quoted
Horacio Arce as saying the rebels were planning a ``large
political-military attack'' on the government before Jan. 20.
   Arce, who defected in September, said the rebels aimed ``to show
the new American administration that they are alive and
operationally capable and deserve continued support.''
   In that way the Contras, as the rebels are known, might persuade
the U.S. Congress to approve new aid or release $17 million in
frozen military aid, Arce was quoted as saying.
   Congress cut off military aid to the Contras in February and
about 10,000 rebels _ the bulk of the fighting force _ fled to base
camps just across the Honduran border, where they have been
supported by U.S. continued humanitarian aid.
   In earlier interviews Arce, whose nom de guerre was ``The
Mercenary,'' has discussed involvement by Americans and Hondurans in
supplying and helping the Contras in their fight to overthrow the
Sandinistas, who came to power in 1979 when a popular revolution
ousted President Anastasio Somoza, a rightist strongman.
   The Contras have been mounting only small ambushes since March,
when they signed a limited cease-fire with the Sandinistas. The
truce has been renewed several times and is still in effect,
although peace talks ended in deadlock in September.

   An American Airlines jet bound for
Dallas with 190 people aboard made an unscheduled landing Tuesday
after a passenger gave a threatening note to a flight attendant, an
airline spokesman said.
   Flight 240 from San Francisco was evacuated on a remote stretch
of runway at the Albuquerque International Airport, and the FBI
arrested the passenger, said Jim Brown, the airline's spokesman in
Dallas.
   Authorities using bomb-sniffing dogs searched the plane for a
weapon or bomb, but none was immediately found, he said.
   The note said the passenger ``had a gun or weapon of some sort,''
Brown said. The note also ``included some type of reference to the
possibility of a bomb on board.''
   The flight attendant notified the captain, who decided to divert
to Albuquerque around 4:20 p.m. MST, Brown said.
   The passenger's name was withheld.

   Investigators probing the Pan Am jet
crash said heat damage on the cargo bay's plastic lining was caused
most probably by an explosion among luggage, the London Times
reported Wednesday.
   The newspaper also said some of the recovered bodies of the
passengers and crew of the Boeing 747 were found to have slivers of
metal embedded in them.
   But it remains to be proved that a bomb caused the damage and
injuries in the Dec. 21 crash of Flight 103, it said. The newspaper
did not identify the investigators and experts cited.
   ``One (investigator) indicated that the cargo bay lining was the
most significant find,'' the newspaper reported. ``It is made of
kevlar, an extremely strong but lightweight polymer compound ideally
suited to aircraft construction.
   ``The signs of heat damage were clearly evident but it will be
left to the scientists'' at the Ministry of Defense's Royal
Armaments Research and Development Establishment at Fort Halstead in
Kent ``to prove that the damage was caused by a bomb,'' it said.
   Tests on a suitcase and wreckage from the plane began Tuesday at
the center, Britain's leading explosives research unit, said
Transport Department press officer Penny Russell-Smith.
   All 259 aboard the jet were killed and 11 Lockerbie residents in
an area where a huge chunk of wreckage fell are missing and presumed
dead.
   The Times said more suitcases which had been ripped by metal
fragments were also recovered Tuesday.
   ``Experts believe that the damage and injuries are incompatible
with a catastrophic structural failure of the jet, the other
possible cause of the disaster,'' it said.
   The bodies of five Americans killed in the crash began the
journey home Tuesday night.
   In a biting Scottish wind, hundreds of residents lined the
streets of Lockerbie to pay silent tribute as a police motorcycle
led a long white truck slowly through town carrying the five plain
pine coffins.
   The bodies were the first among the crash victims identified and
released for burial.
   An honor guard of Pan Am flight attendants, police, soldiers,
U.S. Embassy officials and rescue workers stood quietly as the five
coffins were moved from a warehouse, serving as a chapel, and placed
in the truck.
   The bodies were to be put on flights from London to the United
States, expected to arrive in New York Wednesday afternoon.
   Some women bowed their heads, one man raised a hand in a gesture
of farewell, and the Lord Lieutenant of Dumfriesshire, John
Milne-Hulme, who represents Queen Elizabeth II in the region, stood
at attention with local council officials.
   Police spokesman Angus Kennedy identified the five Americans as
Kenneth Raymond Garczynski, 37, of North Brunswick, N.J.; Om Dixit,
55, of Fairborn, Ohio; his wife, Shanti Dixit, 53; and their two
grandchildren, Suruchi Rattan, 3, and her 2-year-old brother Anmol,
of Warren, Mich. The children's mother, Garima, 29, was also aboard
the plane but her body apparently has not been identified.
   So far 241 bodies have been found, including one Kennedy said was
spotted Tuesday night. Eighteen passengers or crew members remain
missing. Pan Am said Tuesday the plane carried 259 people, revising
its earlier figure of 258 after discovering another infant was
aboard.
   Between 600 and 700 people, including 15 divers and 100 soldiers
of the 1st Gordon Highlanders, searched dense woods and icy,
rain-swollen waters Tuesday in a 100-square mile area of
southwestern Scotland for missing victims and wreckage, including
parts of the aircraft's wings.
   Paul Newell, deputy chief constable of the regional police force,
said the searchers were supported by three helicopters and 38 dogs.
   Ms. Russell-Smith said results of the tests at the research
center probably would not be announced until after investigators
reach a conclusion on the cause.
   She would not comment on why one particular suitcase was being so
closely examined, except to say it ``exhibited characteristics which
merit further consideration.''
   Newell said the suitcase was found in hills east of Lockerbie.
   Experts have said structural failure or a bomb are the most
likely reasons for why the jetliner disappeared from radar screens
just as it reached cruising altitude at 31,000 feet over southwest
Scotland.
   Flight 103 originated as a Boeing 727 from Frankfurt, West
Germany, with a change of planes at London's Heathrow Airport.
Federal police in West Germany and the commander of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist squad last week began investigations at those
airports.
   West German investigators said Tuesday their probes were
continuing, but had not turned up any evidence of wrongdoing in
Frankfurt.
   Four men in the Lockerbie area have been arrested since Monday
after being found in possession of parts of the aircraft, Kennedy
said. They were scheduled to appear in court Wednesday.
   Newell said on the ``CBS Morning News'' that ``in fact, they
hadn't taken a great deal. But nevertheless I personally find it
disgusting and distasteful.''

   Jiang Qing, the 74-year-old widow of Mao Tse-tung,
is critically ill in prison, where she is serving a life term for
her role in the radical leftist Cultural Revolution, an official
daily said Wednesday.
   The China Daily quoted a Justice Ministry official as saying
Jiang is receiving treatment in prison for unspecified diseases
relating to old age.
   The official denied persistent reports that she is suffering from
throat cancer.
   Last week, China Youth, an official monthly, said Jiang had left
prison and was being treated in a hospital for throat cancer. The
ministry also denied that report.
   Jiang was arrested in October 1976, a month after Mao died, and
was branded the chief villainess of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution
during which millions of Chinese were persecuted or found their
lives disrupted by warring ultraleftist factions.
   She was accused of being ringleader of the ``Gang of Four'' who
tried to seize power after Mao's death. In 1981, she was sentenced
to death but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1983.

<HEAD>Humperdinck Files $50 Million Libel Suit Against Tabloid for AIDS
Story</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Entertainer Engelbert Humperdinck filed a $50
million libel lawsuit against the National Enquirer on Tuesday,
contending the tabloid falsely and maliciously reported he has the
deadly AIDS virus.
   The lawsuit filed in Superior Court says the entertainer doesn't
have acquired immune deficiency syndrome and has never tested
positive for the virus that causes the incurable disease.
   The National Enquirer, a weekly supermarket tabloid that boasts
the largest circulation of any paper in the United States, used a
headline above a Dec. 27, 1988, story that read ``Engelbert Has AIDS
Virus.''
   ``In shocking court papers, the mother of Engelbert Humperdinck's
illegitimate daughter declares that the superstar singer is battling
the AIDS virus,'' the Lantana, Fla.-based National Enquirer said.
   Kathy Jetter previously had filed papers in New York City's
Family Court demanding that Humperdinck, 52, provide for the
financial future of her 12-year-old daughter, already ruled by a
court to be his daughter.
   The woman's unsubstantiated and false claims about the
entertainer in a reply affidavit in the case were ultimately
dismissed by the New York court, which the tabloid failed to report,
Humperdinck's lawsuit said.
   The paper's headquarters were closed Tuesday night and a security
guard said no one was available for comment.
   Humperdinck, whose real name is Arnold G. Dorsey, is best known
for his hit songs ``Please Release Me'' and ``After the Lovin'.''

<HEAD>Alleged `Courier' Ordered Held for Trial in Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Turkish-born man described by U.S.
prosecutors as the ``courier and paymaster'' in an East Bloc
espionage operation was ordered Tuesday to stand trial in Georgia.
   U.S. Magistrate Paul Game Jr. found sufficient evidence to keep
Huseyin Yildirim, 60, in custody until he can be taken to Savannah,
Ga., to face a charge of plotting to sell sensitive national
security secrets to East Germany and the Soviet Union.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Jackowski contends Yildirim was a
``courier and paymaster'' who acted as a conduit to copy and pass
classified defense documents to the East Germans, then collect the
pay and pass the cash to Warrant Officer James William Hall III.
   The arrests followed a meeting at a Savannah hotel last week
between Hall and an FBI agent posing as a Soviet intelligence
officer, according to an affidavit filed by FBI agent Charles B.
Youmans Jr.
   Hall told the undercover agent that he had been passing highly
sensitive intelligence documents to Soviet and East German
intelligence services since late 1982, the affidavit said.
   Defense attorney Arthur Addess described Yildirim, who was born

and denied he was party to the alleged espionage.
   Hall had a top-secret clearance at Fort Stewart, Ga., at the time
of his arrest last week. He appeared Tuesday at Fort Meade, Md.,
before Army magistrate Lt. Col. William Ramsey, who determined the
Army had probable cause to detain Hall for 30 days, during which
time charges may be filed.
   No date was set for Yildirim's trial.

   Communist rebels killed a town mayor
and his policeman driver and wounded five other people in an ambush
on the north coast of Mindanao Island, the military said Wednesday.
   Another policeman was missing after the attack Tuesday on Mayor
Porferio Branzuela along a highway in Plaridel town in Misamis
Occidental province, 455 miles southeast of Manila, said military
spokesman Maj. Filipino Amoguis.
   Amoguis said an undetermined number of New People's Army
guerrillas fired on the police jeep carrying Branzuela, mayor of
Calamba town, killing him and his driver, policeman Eddie Torres.
Three policemen, a soldier and Branzuela's civilian bodyguard were
wounded.
   Calamba, about eight miles southwest of Plaridel, has a
population of about 15,000.
   The ambush came about eight hours after expiration of a Christmas
cease-fire called by the New People's Army and President Corazon
Aquino.
   In Zamboanga City, also on Mindanao Island, fire of undetermined
origin leveled the entire Moslem-dominated barter trade center,
destroying about $1.3 million worth of goods but causing no
injuries, officials said Wednesday.
   In Manila, the newspaper Malaya quoted witnesses as saying the
Tuesday night fire was preceded by two loud explosions, possibly
from grenades.
   But military and police officials could not confirm the report.
   Mindanao Island is wracked with both communist and Moslem
rebellions.

   Shooting broke out Tuesday between
soldiers and suspected rebels in eastern Suriname and one soldier
was wounded, an army spokesman said.
   Officials also reported that in the past week, gunmen shot at
soldiers from a single-engine aircraft and guerrillas seized a small
twin-engine plane, capturing the pilot.
   Maj. Badrassein Sital said soldiers at Albina, on Suriname's
border with French Guiana, exchanged gunfire with unidentified
gunmen. He gave no details.
   Sital also reported that on Monday gunmen in a single-engine
aircraft flew over Albina, shooting at soldiers in a military post,
who fired back.
   Rebel leader Ronny Brunswijk's group known as Jungle Commando is
based near Albina, on Stoelman Island on the Maroni River, which
separates the two South American nations.
   Sital said a 12-seat Crown Air plane was hijacked by guerrillas
Thursday in a village in central Suriname.
   A civilian pilot, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday he sighted the hijacked plane on Stoelman Island.
   The plane's pilot, Ernst Loor, is still being held by guerrillas,
a Crown Air official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He
said Loor was allowed to call his company on the plane's radio
Tuesday and said he was in good health.
   The plane flew to Botopasi village, about 150 miles south of
Paramaribo, to pick up a group of seven Dutch and Surinamese
tourists after one of their two canoes sank. Four guerrillas
hijacked the plane after it landed. The tourists returned to
Paramaribo by boat and car.
   Brunswijk's Jungle Commando has waged guerrilla war against
Suriname's 5,000-man army since 1986. Brunswijk and the government
agreed to a cease-fire in July, but several skirmishes have taken
place since then between soldiers and gunmen believed to be renegade
rebels.
   Suriname, with a population of 400,000, became independent from
the Netherlands in 1975.

   Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the guerrilla
group headed by Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal, said
Tuesday it was ``painfully saddened'' by the crash of the Pan
American jumbo jet in Scotland.
   Spokesman Atef Abu Bakr said the organization ``extends its
condolences to the families of the victims who perished in this
disaster.''
   His statement appeared aimed at rebutting charges that the group
headed by Abu Nidal _ real name Sabry al-Banna _ may have placed a
bomb on Pan Am Flight 103. The jet crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland,
on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard.
   The radical Palestinian group is held responsible for dozens of
hijackings, bombings and assassinations since it was founded in 1974.
   Israel blamed the crash on Arab terrorists. But Chairman Yasser
Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization said such reports
are aimed at torpedoing his recent peace initiative.
   U.S. government spokesmen said that about two weeks before the
crash, a caller claiming to speak for Abu Nidal's faction telephoned
the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, warning that a Pan Am
passenger jet bound from Europe for New York would be attacked.

   Academy Award-winning director Hal Ashby,
whose versatile style shaped acclaimed films like ``Harold and
Maude,'' ``Being There'' and ``Coming Home,'' died from liver cancer
Tuesday. He was 59.
   Ashby, who was working on his new movie, ``Hand Carved Coffins,''
died at home, said business manager Larry Reynolds.
   Ashby directed ``The Landlord,'' ``The Last Detail,'' ``Bound for
Glory,'' ``Shampoo,'' ``The Slugger's Wife'' and ``Eight Million
Ways to Die.''
   ``Hal had a genius for finding the humor and beauty in the most
unlikely places,'' said Bud Cort, who starred in ``Harold and
Maude,'' a classic black comedy. ``He created an atmosphere of trust
and affection that was unparalleled for me.''
   Ashby's anti-war film ``Coming Home,'' a story of a paraplegic's
return from Vietnam, won Oscars in 1978 for the film's stars, Jane
Fonda and Jon Voight.
   Although he was best known as a director with a talent for
visually striking images, Ashby was also a gifted editor, winning a
1967 Academy Award for his work on ``In The Heat of the Night,''
directed by Norman Jewison and starring Sidney Poitier and Rod
Steiger.
   His editing collaboration with director Jewison was also seen in
the films ``The Cincinnati Kid'' and ``The Russians are Coming, the
Russians are Coming.''
   Ashby, who was born in Ogden, Utah, directed his first film,
``The Landlord,'' with Beau Bridges and Pearl Bailey in 1970. Two
years later, he directed ``Harold and Maude,'' an inventive look at
the relationship between a suicidal 20-year-old man (Cort) and
79-year-old swinger (Ruth Gordon). The movie still has a strong cult
following.
   He subsequently directed a string of both critically and
commercial successes, including ``The Last Detail,'' with Jack
Nicholson; ``Shampoo,'' with Warren Beatty and Julie Christie; and
``Bound for Glory,'' a story of folk singer Woody Guthrie starring
David Carradine.
   Ashby is survived by a sister, Ardith Thompson, and a brother,
Jack. Memorial arrangements were pending.

   The first of the dead have been
identified from Pan Am Flight 103, and investigators were examining
a single suitcase for clues as to whether a bomb or structural
failure caused Britain's worst air disaster.
   Police hoped to release perhaps half a dozen bodies to next of
kin today once the last formality of registering the death in
Lockerbie is completed. Names and nationalities were not issued.
   One more victim was found Monday, bringing the total in two
temporary morgues in the city hall and an ice rink to 240. That's 29
short of the apparent total _ 258 on the Boeing 747 and 11 listed as
missing on the ground.
   A team of civilian and Royal Air Force pathologists and a group
of orthodontists were examining the bodies and expect to take
another 10 days to complete identifications.

   Two recent federal inspections found
fuselage cracks and corrosion in an aging Boeing 727 that tore open
at 31,000 feet and caused some of the 110 people aboard to fear a
bomb had exploded.
   Eastern Airlines Flight 251 from Rochester, N.Y., to Atlanta
landed safely Monday at Yeager Airport here after the 14-inch hole
in the fuselage caused the plane to lose cabin pressure, authorities
said.
   Two passengers were treated at Charleston Area Medical Center for
nosebleeds and headaches as a result of the decompression, said Gary
Chernenko, a hospital spokesman.
   Passenger Sam Piazza, 55, a former pilot from Boca Raton, Fla.,
said he and his wife at first thought a bomb had exploded, a
possible cause of last week's crash of Pan Am Flight 103 with 258
aboard in Scotland.
   The opening in the crown of the fuselage was ``about a 14-inch
square hole,'' said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jack
Barker in Atlanta. ``Those things start with a crack and end up as a
hole.''

   More than 130 African students trying to flee to
Beijing were held incommunicado today in a Nanking hotel to keep
them from angry Chinese students after three days of racial clashes,
an official said.
   About 5,000 Chinese youths chanting ``Kill the black ghosts!'' on
Monday surrounded the central Chinese city's train station as the
students tried to depart for the capital by rail, American witnesses
said.
   But police would not let the Africans embark and had to carry
them from the station, one American student said.
   The disturbances, which began when African students brought
Chinese women to a weekend school dance, were the latest in a series
of violent outbreaks between African students and Chinese during the

   Ronald Reagan leaves office with his personal
popularity intact, but with Americans viewing him unfavorably on
many policy issues, a Media General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Most respondents viewed Reagan's performance negatively on social
and governmental issues such as education and ethics. A majority
also rated his judgment unfavorably.
   Yet Reagan retained his enormous personal approval. A vast
two-thirds endorsed the way he has done his job overall. Many said
history will view him positively and 55 percent said he has made the
country better.
   The national survey of 1,084 adults found two factors at the
heart of Reagan's popularity: high ratings for his leadership and a
belief that his economic policies the past eight years have been
good.
   The survey, conducted Nov. 10-20, has a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.

   Unless you're compelled to spend New Year's Eve
knee-deep in honking, confetti-hurling strangers, there's plenty of
entertainment right at home with a loyal friend who's been there for
you all year _ your television set.
   It doesn't hand out party favors or free champagne, but Saturday
night TV offers an array of musical specials featuring, among others
this year, Johann Strauss, Placido Domingo, Mel Torme, Reba
McEntire, Manhattan Transfer, Robert Plant and Hall & Oates.
   Public television is especially busy. Check local listings with
the big-band sounds of ``Happy New Year U.S.A.!'' and Mel Torme; and
``Live from Lincoln Center'' with Zubin Mehta, Placido Domingo and
the New York Philharmonic.
   On Sunday, the Vienna Philharmonic has its fifth New Year's
special on PBS, this time featuring conductor Carlos Kleiber and a
program of Strauss music. Walter Cronkite is once again host of the
special.
   At a recent luncheon to publicize ``From Vienna: The New Year's
Celebration 1989,'' Cronkite recalled that last year's taping of his
introduction _ from a balcony overlooking the stage before the
concert began _ didn't exactly stir the holiday spirit in everyone.
   ``Last year, a harpist _ more harpy than harpist _ showed up very
early to tune up her harp. Every time I got up to say anything, the
harp starts going,'' said Cronkite. ``We sent a runner down asking
her to desist for five minutes. No, not for TV.
   ``I always thought the harp was kind of a gentle instrument. Not
in her hands. It was a trumpet of Jericho. We sent the management of
the house, in tails. She still was not moving.
   ``Then two stage hands came out and picked her up with the harp
and carried her out of the hall, outside somewhere.''
   The show went on, as it will this year. Incidentally, Cronkite's
favorite waltz is ``The Blue Danube.'' He says the Austrians might
write them, but Americans know the finer points of dancing them, and
he and his wife, Betsy, impress the Viennese by reversing during a
waltz. ``They appreciate this,'' Cronkite said. ``They have
difficulty reversing in a waltz.''
   If you prefer to see in the new year getting down with some hard
rock, MTV offers ``Big Bang '89,'' a countdown of top videos. Close
to midnight on the East Coast, MTV will go live to Times Square,
where comedian Sandra Bernhard will be joined by guests Gilbert
Gottfried, Robert Downey Jr. and Whoopi Goldberg, among others.
Then, thanks to the magic of time zones, MTV will move to the West
Coast for its midnight celebration with comedian Sam Kinison as host
and guests who include rockers Robert Plant, Hall & Oates and Poison.
   Want to rock but have no cable? ABC has ``Dick Clark's New Year's
Rockin' Eve '89,'' with live reports from Times Square on Saturday
night, as well as the Cocoanut Grove in Hollywood, featuring
performances by Natalie Cole, Taylor Dayne, Richard Marx, Reba
McEntire and Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons, among others.
   The Disney Channel will be repeating ``The Manhattan Transfer:
Going Home,'' which isn't necessarily a New Year's Eve special, but
features the always welcome jazz sounds of the famed vocal quartet.
   Back over on PBS, Mel Torme returns for a second year as host of
``Happy New Year U.S.A.!'', a big-band and jazz show that originates
live from Baltimore. This year, Torme is joined by vocalists
Rosemary Clooney and Lonette McKee and the Glenn Miller Orchestra.
There will also be ice dancing with John Curry and JoJo Starbuck.

<HEAD>Ian Buchanan of `General Hospital' Got Off to Tough Start as Actor</HEAD>

   The first professional acting work by soap
opera star Ian Buchanan, for ``The Equalizer'' on CBS, left him
bruised, in tears and wondering if he'd made the right move in
giving up modeling for acting.
   Buchanan's career as a model had taken him on assignment to
France, Italy, Japan and other exotic places. He had one of the most
photographed faces in Europe.
   Currently starring as Duke Lavery in ABC's ``General Hospital,''
he was lured to New York from his native Scotland first as a model.
But despite the success, he wasn't satisfied.
   ``I first started working in the hotel industry,'' he said.
``Then I discovered there were warmer places than Scotland. I headed
for the sun and started modeling in Spain. Modeling sounds better in
Spanish.
   ``When you're a model you travel all over Europe. You can call
them a traveling circus or a pack of hyenas. You get there first,
and you never tell your best friend they're hiring. Models are
everything people say they are.''
   He made his career change by enrolling at the New York Actors
Studio, founded by Lee Strasberg. ``Strasberg died the next day,''
he said. ``I hung in for about a year. I also studied with Marcia
Haufrecht.''
   His first acting job on the episode of ``The Equalizer'' was a
very bumpy ride.
   ``They dragged me down the stairs and killed me,'' he said. ``We
had no rehearsal. The director was in a hurry. They threw me into
the back of a car, banged my head and drove off. I was not supposed
to have any dialogue.
   ``They looked at the film and said, `Your lips keep moving.' I
kept yelling, `I'm not a stunt man!' I was black and blue. I was
wearing my own shoes. When they dragged me they ripped the toes off.
I was in tears. But I was in show business. No one said it was easy.
I did get to see Edward Woodward. I saw him out of the corner of my
eye when they threw me in the trunk.''
   His luck changed when he met Gloria Monte, then executive
producer of ``General Hospital.'' At that time ``General Hospital''
was going through the roof as television's supersoap opera.
   He auditioned and was quickly hired. His role as the adventurous
and romantic Duke Lavery was the first time he had dialogue. He won
the Soap Opera Digest ``Soapy Award'' as 1987's best male newcomer
of the year.
   Buchanan has been nominated for this year's awards as outstanding
hero. The Soapies will be presented Jan. 14 and will be televised on
NBC on Jan. 16.
   Buchanan was interviewed in his Hollywood apartment, where he was
recuperating from minor surgery. In the meantime, ``General
Hospital'' suspended production for two weeks to move from the
Sunset-Gower Studios to a new sound stage at the ABC Studios.
   Buchanan joined the show after the Luke and Laura episodes. Luke
Spencer (Anthony Geary) and Laura Baldwin (Genie Francis) were
dubbed the Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara of the soaps. Both left
the show not long after their much-ballyhooed wedding raised the
show's audience to record levels. The ratings have slipped since
then, but ``General Hospital'' generally trades first or second
place with CBS' ``The Young and the Restless.'' In the most recent
ratings period it was first.
   Buchanan was cast because ``General Hospital'' needed a new hero
with a shady past and a hint of menace.
   ``I had my own wedding to Finola Hughes (playing Anna Devane),''
he said. ``I was wearing kilts from the McLean clan, since my
grandmother was a McLean. Pictures of the wedding were sent around
the world and one ran in color in a newspaper in Scotland. One of my
brothers called and said, `I see you married John Travolta's
girlfriend.' She had been with him in `Staying Alive.' I had to
explain to him that I was just doing a TV show.''
   Duke Lavery began as a shady nightclub owner. ``I think every
picture in the 1940s with Joan Crawford had a shady nightclub
owner,'' he said. ``Then he fell in love and tried to clean up his
act. But he wasn't clever enough to completely cover his tracks.
   ``He still runs the club but sometimes I forget that. On a soap
you can go for months on end without ever having to go to work.''
   Buchanan has also been appearing as himself on ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show.''

full of work that has never been done, full of tasks, claims, and
demands; and let us see that we learn to take it without letting
fall too much of what it has to bestow upon those who demand of it
necessary, serious and great things.'' _ Rainer Maria Rilke, German
poet (1876-1926).

<HEAD>U.S. Elections and Armenian Earthquake Voted 1988's Top Stories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULES LOH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. presidential election and the earthquake that devastated
Soviet Armenia, killing tens of thousands of people, were the top
two news stories of 1988 in a year-end poll of Associated Press
member newspaper editors and broadcasters.
   The election story accumulated 1,412 points in the annual survey;
the earthquake, 1,404.
   It was a year in which U.S.-Soviet relations showed a warming
trend, capped by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's announcement of a
substantial, unilateral cut in Soviet troop strength. The start of
the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Reagan-Gorbachev summit
in Moscow and the Soviet leader's continuing overhaul of the Soviet
system, amid nationalist unrest in some Soviet republics, also made
big news.
   Ballots were returned by 106 Associated Press newspaper editors
and 126 broadcasters who ranked the year's headline events, from No.
1 through No. 10. A first-place vote counted 10 points, a 10th-place
vote one point.
   The total of 232 was about 200 votes fewer than usual.
Late-breaking events had required a revised ballot and second vote,
making earlier ballots outdated.
   Even so, the Dec. 21 crash of a Pan American Airways jumbojet on
a flight from London to New York, which killed all 259 aboard and an
estimated dozen on the ground, occurred too late to be included in
the top-10 ranking.
   As it has so often in recent decades, the Mideast again grabbed
major attention, especially with the United States' policy reversal
in opening talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Domestically, stories on the environment ranked high. News
included the Midwestern drought (which placed third), as well as
forest fires, dirty beaches and even a pair of forlorn whales.
   The annual rankings are not conducted as a scientific poll but an
informal survey, the collective view of people who deal with the
news daily in a nation of diverse regional concerns.
   The national election, leading the editors' ballots, was a race
characterized by what analysts called ``negative'' campaigning, in
which prepared TV ads often spoke for the candidates _ Vice
President George Bush and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, and the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, Michael
Dukakis, and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Bush won 40 states and 426 electoral votes. Dukakis won 10 states
and the District of Columbia, and 111 electoral votes. The popular
vote was 54 percent to 46 percent in favor of Bush. The turnout was
estimated at slightly more than 50 percent of the voting-age
population, the lowest since 1924.
   It was not a total rout for the Democrats. They gained a seat in
the Senate, for a 55-45 majority, and picked up three seats in the
House, to maintain control by 260-175. The Democrats also managed a
gain of one governor and now hold 28 of the nation's 50
governorships.
   The Armenian earthquake _ ranked second among 1988's news stories
_ occurred at 11:41 a.m. on Dec. 7 and, by seismic standards, was
not an especially large shock. It registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale as compared, for example, with Mexico City's 8.1 quake of 1985
and Alaska's 1964 quake of 8.5.
   But the devastation wrought by the Armenian quake was staggering.
At least 50,000 perished and 500,000 were left homeless. At year's
end the ultimate number was still unknown, even as Mexico City's
10,000 deaths remains only a guess three years later. (The Alaska
quake killed only 114.)
   The Armenian quake leveled entire cities and towns. Leninakan, a
city of 290,000, was 80 percent destroyed. Two other mid-size
cities, Kirovakan and Stepanavan, suffered similarly. Spitak, a city
of 16,000, was effectively wiped out. Nations east and west,
including the United States, responded immediately with offers of
help. For the first time since the lend-lease days of World War II,
the Soviets accepted the U.S. offer.
   Soviet authorities blamed the extent of the destruction partly on
shoddy construction work during the pre-Gorbachev ``Brezhnev era.''
There were allegations that contractors, to meet tight schedules in
an ailing economy, had larded their mortar with sand, weakening the
buildings.
   Nationalist zeal persisted amid the devastation. Some militant
Armenians claimed that in resettling orphans outside Armenia the
Soviets were trying to snatch them from their culture. Gorbachev,
who cut short a U.S. visit to fly to the stricken area, was
chagrined by the ethnic politics amid such misery and by the Soviet
press criticism of relief efforts as chaotic.
   The U.S. drought, the No. 3 story, accumulated 1,099 points.
   At a time when America's farmers were just beginning to recover
from the economic crisis of the early 1980s, along came the worst
drought in a half-century, the worst since the dark dry days of the
Dust Bowl. So little rain fell on the Great Plains and elsewhere in
the Midwest that even the mighty Mississippi River, in June, shrunk
to the point where more than a thousand barges were left stranded.
   Across the arid countryside the corn harvest fell by 34 percent
from the previous year's bumper crop, soybeans by 21 percent, spring
wheat by 54 percent.
   Relief did not come until August _ not from rain, which was too
late in most areas, but from a $3.9 billion drought aid bill that
helped farmers who harvested less than 65 percent of normal
production. By fall, the Farmers Home Administration had declared
1,489 counties eligible for emergency disaster loans, including 13
entire states, more than one-fifth of the nation.
   A tragedy in the Persian Gulf was judged the No. 4 news event,
with 901 points.
   At 10:54 a.m. on July 3, the U.S. warship Vincennes, under
assault by Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf, mistook a civilian
airliner on a routine flight for an attacking Iranian fighter plane
and shot it down. All 290 people aboard the Iran Air plane perished.
   Capt. Will Rogers III of the Vincennes called his $1.2 billion
vessel ``the most sophisticated ship in the world, bar none,'' and a
senior naval officer called Rogers,``the best of the best of the
best.''
   A Navy board of inquiry found that Rogers' action was
understandable in light of the information available. It said the
``fog of war'' and stress of combat may have contributed to the
tragedy. But an international investigatory panel found the Navy
culpable, saying its ships should have been monitoring such civilian
air traffic.
   ``This is a burden I will carry for the rest of my life,'' said
Rogers. The United States elected to pay compensation to the
victims' families.
   America's re-entry into space earned fifth place in the year-end
poll, with 872 points.
   Space shuttle launches had become routine until the Challenger
explosion killed seven crew members in 1986. Consequently, when five
astronauts boarded the shuttle Discovery in September, it was no
ordinary mission. The future of the U.S. space program rested on its
success.
   One of the astronauts' own, Navy Capt. Robert Crippen, a veteran
of four shuttle missions, would call ``go'' or ``no go.'' No one
person had that responsibility before, but NASA decided it needed a
launch ``czar'' to avoid the communications failures that
contributed to the Challenger disaster.

   On the morning of Sept. 29, Crippen consulted with his 21
advisers, experts on all phases of the mission, including weather
observers, who were nervous about high-altitude winds above Cape
Canaveral and at emergency landing sites around the globe. At last
Crippen gave the ``go.''
   The result was splendid. Discovery roared off and the astronauts
returned to Earth four days later after a remarkably smooth flight
during which they deployed a communications satellite.
   Two months later a second shuttle, Atlantis, took off on a secret
Defense Department mission, another success, setting the stage for a
planned seven-flight schedule in 1989.
   Developments in the Mideast ranked in sixth place in 1988, with
641 points.
   After years of maneuverings and hesitations, Yasser Arafat
finally made it clear enough to satisfy a skeptical United States:
The Palestine Liberation Organization, which he heads, accepts the
existence of Israel and renounces all forms of terrorism.
   And so on Dec. 14, in a startling reversal of policy, President
Reagan announced that the United States would open a ``substantive
dialogue'' with the PLO. Israeli leaders expressed dismay and
disappointment, even though U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
added that ``the U.S. commitment to the security of Israel remains
unflinching.''
   The big U.S. turn in the Mideast peace process came as Israel's
dominant parties, the right-of-center Likud and left-of-center
Labor, agreed to form a new coalition government, with Likud's
Yitzhak Shamir as prime minister. Labor Party leader Simon Peres
will serve as finance minister.
   Earlier in the year, Jordan had cut its administrative ties to
the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a Palestinian uprising ground
on, and the PLO had proclaimed a Palestinian state. It was a
phantom, but an important Arab symbol.
   The U.S. opening to the PLO came, ironically, after it had
refused Arafat entry to the United States to address the United
Nations. The U.N. General Assembly thereupon moved temporarily to
Geneva to hear Arafat call for negotiations that would include
Israel and the PLO. That speech failed to meet the U.S. conditions,
but Arafat's statements at a news conference afterward did.
   The end of the Iran-Iraq War scored seventh in the voting, with
544 points. After eight years of slaughter in which well over a
million people, and perhaps 2 million, were killed or wounded, in
which 13-year-old boys died as volunteer sacrificial minesweepers,
in which clouds of poison gas wiped out entire villages, in which
hundreds of billions of dollars were squandered for revenge and
martyrdom, the war between Iran and Iraq ended in August. That grim
event ranked seventh among the news stories in the AP year-end poll.
   After the cease-fire Aug. 20, the devastated rivals began peace
talks. Neither was a victor. The two countries need an estimated
$110 billion to rebuild everything from their oil fields to their
schools. With the stress of the battle over, hopes rose that Iran
might seek a rapprochement with the United States, and terrorism
might abate in its random search for victims.
   The nation's environment, in its broadest sense, ranked eighth in
the voting, with 506 points.
   The health of the planet, its winds, oceans, the land itself, did
not fare well in 1988.
   The ``greenhouse effect'' _ the development of a blanket of
carbon dioxide allowing heat to accumulate in the atmosphere _ was
at least partly blamed for the drought and other climatic changes.
The use of aerosol containers was pouring a gas into the air that
was blamed for a hole over the Antarctic in the atmospheric shield
against cancer-causing ultraviolet rays _ a warning, some scientists
said, of disaster to come.
   Meanwhile, syringes and other refuse washed ashore on some of the
nation's beaches, where the barefoot once waded with impunity.
Beaches were closed along the northern Atlantic seaboard, and the
public was outraged by the violation of summertime oceanside
serenity.
   Gorbachev's Dec. 7 visit to the United Nations ranked ninth in
the voting, with 504 points.
   The Soviet leader startled the world body, along with U.S.
planners and diplomats, by announcing that the Soviet Union would,
unilaterally, reduce its armed forces by 500,000 troops, along with
tanks and other equipment. News of the Armenian earthquake required
Gorbachev to cut short his visit to New York, which had welcomed the
Soviet leader warmly and enthusiastically.
   In voting the Gorbachev announcement No. 9, many editors also
took note of the May 29 Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in Moscow, and of
Gorbachev's June 28 announcement of reforms within the Soviet Union
_ ``glasnost,'' more openness, and ``perestroika,'' economic
revamping.
   One of the nation's worst sieges of forest fires ranked as the
No. 10 news story, with 492 points.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, which keeps track of the
nation's wildfires, said that through the exceptionally dry year
more than 30,000 firefighters battled 72,000 blazes that charred
more than 5 million acres in the United States, including 2.2
million acres in Alaska.
   By mid-July, a dozen fires raged in the venerable Yellowstone
National Park. Other fires blazed in six surrounding national
forests.
   When November snows finally smothered the Yellowstone flames,
706,278 acres, nearly half of the 2.2-million-acre ``mother park,''
were black and dead, 29 buildings were destroyed, including 20 at
the Old Faithful complex. More than $115 million had been spent in
mostly futile firefighting efforts, and the economies of tourist
towns in three states suffered.
   The blazes called into dispute an established wildfire management
policy that decreed that forest fires caused by people should be
fought, but those touched off by nature should be allowed to burn if
there were no threat to life or property or historic sites.
   At year's end that argument still smoldered. But, fire or no
fire, Old Faithful remained faithful to its ageless schedule,
erupting every 75 minutes.
   The second 10 stories were:
   11. The Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Moscow.

   The end of this week brings a milestone of
special interest to economy-watchers in the United States: The last
government statistical report of 1988.
   The numbers, due out Friday on an index designed to gauge the
future course of the economy, are expected to show ambiguous results
_ supporting neither those who think business activity is growing
too fast nor those who fear an impending recession.
   That seems only fitting as the capper on a year in which monthly
economic statistics became a fixation in the financial markets and
elsewhere, but yielded up no agreement on what the figures all meant.
   Analysts at the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co. say Friday's report on the index of leading economic indicators
for November will show a modest decline of perhaps 0.2 percent.
   That would follow a small rise in October (subject to revision in
Friday's report), a decline in September and an increase in August.
   Plus, minus, plus, minus _ the official barometer of the economic
weather is promising something on the order of ``clear to partly
cloudy with a chance of rain or snow.''
   Of course the flow of numbers won't stop with the arrival of the
new year. Indeed, it will be nearly spring before all the last data
have been gathered on the waning stages of 1988.
   By then, stock and bond traders, business analysts and other
interested parties will be closely scrutinizing the statistics to
get a feel for how 1989 has begun.
   But if the hue and cry over each individual number will probably
continue, there is the hope at least that people will come to view
the figures in a more favorable light.
   ``If all else is forgotten, 1988 should be remembered as the year
that all news was bad news,'' said Jay Donnaruma, an analyst at
First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. ``The better the economy did, the
more the markets worried.''
   What would it take to dispel this seemingly perverse pessimism in
the months ahead? The prescription many analysts offer runs
something like this:
   _President-elect Bush makes some decisive proposals to narrow the
federal budget deficit, and gets an unexpectedly upbeat response
from Congress.
   _Economic reports get more consistent, and show an unmistakable
slowing in economic growth to a pace that looks like it can last for
a long time.
   _The Federal Reserve, seeing this, relaxes its tight grip on the
reins of credit policy, allowing interest rates to decline.
   _Lower rates help the stock market to rally with a vigor not seen
since before the crash of 1987.
   Altogether, that's a lot to wish for, especially without some
bumps along the way.
   The bond market, which determines the level of many kinds of
interest rates, swerved up or down a half dozen times in 1988, notes
Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc.
   ``In 1989,'' he says, ``perceptions will undoubtedly continue to
shift many times, but in an anticipated environment of slower
economic growth.''
   The statistics-watchers who help create these sudden shifts in
the perception of the outlook are a much-despised lot. In their
preoccupation with short-term numbers, it is widely agreed, they
lose sight of the thing that matters most _ the long-term direction
of the economy.
   Still, they may serve a useful purpose. After all, by tradition
the ultimate threat to economic health is complacency. And the
figure-followers never sit still long enough to stop worrying.

<HEAD>Church Unity Effort Takes New Turn In Long Journey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   That long, zigzag road of trying to achieve
greater unity among a big swath of American Protestantism has passed
another milestone, taking a new route toward the goal.
   It no longer intends structural merger _ as was originally
contemplated and which has proved the typical bottleneck to unifying
churches _ but nevertheless aims at functional cohesion.
   This time, ``I think it's going to fly,'' says the Rev. David W.
A. Taylor of Princeton, N.J., general secretary of the Consultation
on Church Union. ``After 26 years of work, we've now got a plan
before the churches.''
   Taylor, a Presbyterian, said in a telephone interview that the
plan is ``workable and realistic'' and he predicted the involved
denominations will approve it. ``No question about it, I fully
believe they will.''
   The plan was recommended unanimously at a meeting early this
month in New Orleans of the consultation, involving about 200
representatives of nine denominations totalling more than 22 million
members.
   ``This is the time we have been working and praying for,'' said
the Rev. Gerald F. Moede, a United Methodist pastor in Adell, Wis.
As the consultation's former general secretary, he was a chief
architect of the plan.
   It is termed ``covenanting'' and envisages mutual recognition by
the denominations of one another's baptism, membership and clergy,
allowing intercommunion and joint ministry, mission and service.
   Moede called the plan a ``biblical format to bring Christians
together sociologically and theologically to meet today's needs and
those of the future.''
   It doesn't necessitate overhauling and meshing organizational
structures _ usually blocked by power rivalries _ but continues the
present structures, providing for working partnership and mutual
interflow of personnel.
   ``What we have been seeking since the beginning is not uniformity
but unity in things that really matter, like membership and ministry
and mission,'' said the Rev. George H. Pike of Louisville, Ky., a
Presbyterian.
   ``We are not, and never have been, seeking a monolithic
institution.''
   However, the consultation previously had recommended a plan of
structural union, but that 1970 plan soon was dropped after it ran
into widespread denominational opposition.
   That setback followed eight years of work by the consultation,
which was launched in 1962 after the late Presbyterian leader Eugene
Carson Blake urged a unified church that was catholic, reformed and
evangelical.
   Seconded by the late Episcopal Bishop James Pike, Blake's
proposal at an assembly of the National Council of Churches
unleashed an ensuing tide of support _ and sparked formation of the
consultation.
   The nine denominations participating in it are the United
Methodist, Episcopal and Presbyterian churches, the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), United Church of Christ, International
Council of Community Churches and three predominantly black
Methodist denominations.
   They are the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and Christian Methodist Episcopal
Church.
   After the plan for structural merger collapsed, the consultation
took a new tack, working on a theological consensus, with an
agreement reached on it in 1984.
   Six of the nine denominations have accepted the theological
agreement as a basis for the next step toward an operational
covenant, and two denominations _ the U.C.C. and Christian Churches
_ still are to act on the agreement in 1989.
   The ninth denomination, the Episcopal Church, at its 1988
convention commended parts of the agreement, but said some points
needed clarified to make it the basis for covnenanting acts.
   That reworking, done by a drafting committee headed by the Rev.
Paul A. Crow Jr. of Indianapolis, the Christian Church's ecumenical
officer, was the document unanimously approved by the New Orleans
meeting.
   Pike, the consultation's outgoing president, called the approval
a ``historic moment.''
   United Methodist Bishop William Boyd Grove of Charleston, W.Va.,
commented, ``We are on the threshold of a new Pentecostal experience
of the unity of the church.''
   Crow said his committee had received more than 150 suggested
changes reflecting ``a lot of passion and a lot of substance'' and
that about 80 percent of them were included in the revised and
unanimously endorsed plan.
   Denominational legislative assemblies were were asked to approve
it as ``the definitive agreement for joining with other
participating churches in covenant communion.''
   Action by the nine churches is not expected to be complete before
the mid-1990s, since conventions of the denominations are held at
varying intervals.
   African Methodist Episcopal Bishop Vinton R. Anderson of St.
Louis was elected president of the consultation, succeeding Pike.
   Taylor, who replaced Moede as consultation general secretary
three months ago, said, ``We believe we are being led by God in a
new way that has implications far beyond these nine churches _ the
unity of the holy catholic church.''

<HEAD>Year's Religion News Topped by Soviet and Swaggart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs of dawn for a new openness toward religion
appeared in the Soviet Union in 1988, while in the United States,
twilight descended on the career of a scandal-tainted TV evangelist.
   These were among major news stories of religion in a year also
marked by indignation about a movie, blunted hopes about an ancient
burial shroud and arrests for anti-abortion demonstrations.
   Roman Catholicism had its first modern schism, while the
Episcopal Church seemed on the way to ordaining the first woman
bishop in world Anglicanism, and fundamentalists solidified their
Southern Baptist control.
   Also making headlines was an ex-administration official's book
saying Nancy Reagan consulted an astrologer to help plan President
Reagan's schedule, and the launching by mainline religious bodies of
an interfaith cable-TV network.
   There were numerous other religious notes in the news, including
the failed presidential bids by two Baptists _ the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, Democrat, and Pat Robertson, who resigned the ministry to
seek the Republican nomination.
   Samplings indicated white Protestants, including evangelicals and
the religious right, gave the margin to the winner, George Bush.
   The year's development that seemed to promise the most long-range
and historically significant shift in the religious climate began
unfolding in the Soviet Union with its new policy of ``glasnost,''
or openness.
   In contrast to more than a half century of severe religious
suppression, Soviet doors opened to the importation of Bibles, to
gradually eased religious restrictions, to promised legal revisions
to assure religious rights.
   Church dignitaries from around the world took part in Soviet
celebrations marking the millenium of Christianity there.
   American TV evangelism got a jolt when a prominent practicioner,
Jimmy Swaggart, confessed on the air to moral transgressions, later
disclosed as involvement with a New Orleans prostitute.
   When he defied disciplinary procedures ordered by the Assemblies
of God and resumed his broadcasts, it defrocked him. His audience
dwindled _ down from 1.7 million a year ago to 836,000.
   It was the second recent downfall of a prominent TV evangelist.
Jim Bakker had been scuttled by a sex scandal the year before.
   Hollywood sparked a bombshell in religious ranks when it released
the controversial film ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' drawing
widespread protests and picketing by Christians.
   The film, based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, was criticized
for depicting Christ as weak, afraid, vacillating and lusting for
women.
   Fascination with the Shoud of Turin got a setback when carbon-14
tests performed at three separate institutions found that it dated
from medieval times and could not have been the burial cloth
wrapping Christ's body.
   However, some advocates _ including some scientists _ questioned
the procedures used, and insisted the issue still was unresolved.
   More than 1,000 people were arrested and jailed, usually briefly,
in a wave of demonstrations of civil disobedience around the country
to block entrances to abortion clinics.
   A minor schism occurred in Roman Catholicism when traditionalist
Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre ordained four bishops in defiance of the
Vatican and was ex-communicated, along with those persisting in his
movement.
   Lefebvre rejects reforms of the Second Vatican Council of
1962-65, charging it with ``democratizing'' and ``Protestantizing''
the church.
   The Episcopal diocese of Massachusetts elected a woman as bishop,
the Rev. Barbara C. Harris, and if the choice is affirmed by other
dioceses, she would become the first woman bishop in the worldwide
Anglican Communion.
   The Anglican church, like Roman Catholicism and Eastern
Orthodoxy, maintains bishops in succession from apostolic times, so
far confined to men. The prospect of a woman in it has stirred
organized opposition.
   Fundamentalists continued their decade-long streak of victories
in the Southern Baptist convention, electing another of their
adherents, the Rev. Jerry Vines, as president.
   His appointive powers largely deterimines institutional trustees,
and the victory this time completed gradual ascendancy of
fundamentalist majorities on boards throughout the denomination's
institutions and agencies.
   Other major religion stories of the year included:
   _American Catholic bishops decided to produce another paper on
AIDS, after some bishops objected to a previous document's reference
to condoms as a possible protection.
   _Catholic bishops also shot back to the Vatican their strong
objections to a Vatican analysis questioning the basis of national
councils of bishops.
   _The Rev. James Andrews won re-election as chief executive
officer of the the Presbyterian Church (USA), overcoming a close
challenge by a woman candidate.
   _The National Council of Churches, caught in a financial bind,
began steps to reorganize, indicating efforts to form a broader
ecumenical structure including Roman Catholics and evangelicals.
   _``New Age'' spirituality, a mix of various religious and other
traditions, attracted widening attention.

   Christians generally fail to teach respect
for animals, according to participants in a recent meeting sponsored
by the World Council of Churches' unit on ethics.
   Declaring that the Bible teaches that ``animals do not exist for
the sake of unbridled pursuit of human avarice and greed,'' the
conference criticized animal uses in circuses, stage and aquatic
shows, rodeos, bullfights and fights between animals, such as cocks
and dogs.
   Also criticized were recreational hunting, ``needless,
duplicative and poorly executed scientific use of animals,'' killing
of rare species and unnecessary use of animals to test and develop
cosmetic and household products.
   ``In our dealing with animals, whether direct or indirect, the
ethic for the liberation of life requires that we render unto
animals what they are due as creatures with an independent integrity
and values,'' the conference said.

   Roman Catholics are supposed to follow their
consciences, even if that means defying church teachings, Catholic
psychologist Sidney Callahan contends.
   Ms. Callahan of Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., says in the
monthly U.S. Catholic that the church should be considered a guide,
teacher and counselor, but ``ultimately you have to follow your
conscience.''
   ``In fact, according to Saint Thomas Aquinas (great, medieval
Catholic theologian) it is better to be excommunicated than to go
against your conscience,'' she says.

   Respect for the rights of minorities in
increasingly international societies is cited in a 1989 World Day of
Peace message as a key to achieveing peace.
   Theme of the day, observed Jan. 1, is: ``To Build Peace, Respect
Minorities.''
   A Vatican-originated message, issued by the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops, says most countries now include minorities that
seek to maintain their identities, but at the same time societies
grow more globally blended.
   ``The challenge presented by these two apparently opposing trends
goes directly to the heart of peace,'' says the message.
   It says respect for minority rights also is deeply rooted in
religious beliefs.

   Most humor is ``psychologically healthy,'' but
some that is not healthy is happening in ``Jewish American
Princess'' jokes, says Mimi Alperin of the American Jewish Committee.
   Ms. Alperin, who is chairwoman of the group's executive
committee, says that ``the `JAP' joke has driven a wedge between
Jewish men and Jewish women and has now become an acceptable vehicle
for non-Jews to express anti-Semitism.''
   Although such jokes have been used by Jewish comics for many
years, she says in a booklet, ``JAP Jokes: Hateful Humor,'' that
JAP-baiting and ``anti-Semitic events on many college campuses'' are
showing an ugly side.

<TEXT>
   The first time Randy Weston set foot in
Africa, the truth of what his father had been telling him hit home.
   ``The chip has to go back to the block from where it came, that's
what Pop would tell me,'' the 62-year-old jazz pianist and composer
said during a recent seven-day gig in Madrid that found him halfway
between homes in Marrakesh, Morocco, and Brooklyn, N.Y.
   The truth struck him 27 years ago when he visited Nigeria,
Senegal and Morocco on tours sponsored by the U.S. State Department
that took jazz to Africa and, inadvertently, Afro-American jazz
musicians to their musical roots.
   Weston's father was Frank Edward Weston, born in Panama of
Jamaican parents, redoubtable cook and host who often invited his
son's friends and fans home for dinner in Brooklyn or Tangiers
before he died in 1981 at the age of 87.
   Last June, Weston and a French production company finished taping
a video called ``Randy in Tangiers.'' It opens with the musician and
a swarm of youngsters pushing a grand piano up a narrow street in
the medina, or Arab quarter, of the Moroccan port that is the
gateway to Africa.
   ``It's sort of the story of me and my music and how we learned
from Africa,'' said Weston, who lived in Tangiers from 197 to 1972
and ran a jazz club above the Mauritania Cinema.
   His son, Azzedine, a percussionist, was called Niles when he went
to the American School in Tangiers _ the ``Little Niles'' of the
classic Weston composition. His name was changed in a ceremony
performed by Moroccan musicians from the nearby Rif Mountains.
   During his stay in Tangiers, Weston shared musical information
with longtime resident Paul Bowles, the American writer who
collected and documented the music of the Rif for the Library of
Congress, and introduced British and American rock musicians to the
mysteries of the music of the tiny village of Jujuka.
   Weston said if the video is successful, he plans to do another
one in Nigeria where he recently received the Roots Award from the
Nigerian Cultural Association for his contribution to African music.
   The recent emergence of African music and musicians in Europe and
the United States such as King Sunny Ade, Johnny Clegg and Toure
Kunda doesn't surprise Weston. Nor does it shock him that white
musicians such as Paul Simon, through his ``Graceland'' album, are
given credit for introducing music previously considered too exotic
for Western tastes.
   ``What's happening now, I knew it was going to happen. It was
just a matter of time,'' he said. ``The spirit of Africa is
everywhere.''
   But the spirit of racism isn't far behind, Weston added _ the
same racism that forced him and many other black American musicians
to leave the United States in the late 1950s and '60s for Europe or
Africa.
   Weston started playing piano as a child growing up in Brooklyn.
He played as a teen-ager at Broadway dance halls that catered to
lonely servicemen at the outbreak of World War II. He joined the
segregated U.S. Army and served in the quartermaster corps on
Okinawa but wasn't permitted to play in the white Army band.
   ``There were white guys who wanted to play with me,'' he said.
``We'd have to find some old place, and if I got hungry, they'd have
to go and buy me a hamburger because I couldn't go in to get my
own.''
   When he returned to the States he hung out with fellow pianist
Thelonious Monk, and played with drummers Charlie Persip and Max
Roach and saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, Johnny Griffin and Charlie
``Bird'' Parker.
   Weston has mixed feelings about ``Bird,'' Clint Eastwood's film
about Parker, the legendary saxophonist who helped create bebop.
   ``He puts so much emphasis on the drugs that the beautiful things
don't come through,'' Weston said. ``This music is also about
family. We know we are just the continuation of a culture. It's a
very beautiful story, and I don't like to see it distorted.''
   Weston doesn't have a permanent band. Sometimes he plays in
Marrakesh and New York with the Guennaoua, Moroccan descendants of
black slaves who dance and play small metallic cymbals, and whose
haunting tunes form the base of ``Blue Moses,'' one of Weston's
recent compositions.
   In Madrid, and on a Paris gig, he toured with
Trinidadian-American saxophonist Talib Kibwe and Swiss-based Ghanian
percussionist Eric Asante.

   The celluloid torch has been passed to a new
generation: filmmakers who grew up in the 1960s.
   ``Platoon,'' ``Running on Empty,'' ``1969'' and ``Mississippi
Burning'' are among the movies released in the past two years from
writers and directors who brought their own experiences of that
turbulent decade to the screen.
   ``The contemporaries of the '60s are some of the filmmakers of
the '80s. It's natural,'' said Robert Friedman, the senior vice
president of worldwide advertising and publicity at Warner Bros.
   Chris Gerolmo, who wrote the screenplay for ``Mississippi
Burning,'' noted that the sheer passage of time has allowed him and
others to express their feelings about the decade.
   ``Distance is important,'' he said. ``I believe there's a lot of
thinking about that time and America in general.''
   The Vietnam War was a defining experience for many people in the
'60s, shattering the consensus that the United States had a right,
even a moral duty to intervene in conflicts around the world. Even
today, politicians talk disparagingly of the ``Vietnam Syndrome'' in
referring to the country's reluctance to use military force to
settle disputes.
   ``I think future historians will talk about Vietnam as one of the
near destructions of American society,'' said Urie Brofenbrenner, a
professor of sociology at Cornell University.
   ``In World War II, we knew what we were fighting for, but not in
Vietnam.''
   ``Full Metal Jacket,'' ``Gardens of Stone,'' ``Platoon,'' ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Hamburger Hill'' and ``Bat 21'' all use the
war as a dramatic backdrop and show how it shaped characters' lives.
   The Vietnam War has remained an emotional issue in the United
States as veterans have struggled to come to terms with their
experiences. One was Oliver Stone, who wrote and directed the
Academy Award-winning ``Platoon.''
   ``I saw `Platoon' eight times,'' said John J. Anderson, a Palm
Beach County sheriff's lieutenant who served in Vietnam in 1966-67.
``I cried the first time I saw it ... and the third and fourth
times. `Platoon' helped me understand.''
   Stone, who based ``Platoon'' on some of his own experiences as a
grunt, said the film brought up issues that had yet to be resolved.
   ``People are responding to the fact that it's real. They're
curious about the war in Vietnam after 20 years,'' he said.
   While Southeast Asia was the pivotal foreign issue in American
society of the '60s, civil rights was the major domestic issue. The
civil rights movement reached its peak in the ``Freedom Summer'' of
1964, when large groups of volunteers headed South to help register
black voters.
   In ``Five Corners,'' a movie about the summer of '64 in the Bronx
starring Jodie Foster, her friend, played by Tim Robbins, leaves his
neighborhood to volunteer in the South after seeing the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. on television.
   Alan Parker's ``Mississippi Burning'' focuses on an incident that
clouded the Mississippi Summer Project _ when 1,000 young volunteers
from mainstream America swept into the state to help register black
voters. The movie is a fictionalized account of the disappearance
and slaying of three civil rights workers: Michael Schwerner, Andrew
Goodman and James Chaney.
   They were reported missing on June 21, several hours after being
stopped for speeding near Philadelphia, Miss. After a nationally
publicized search, their bodies were discovered Aug. 4 on a farm
just outside the town.
   One of those who recalled the incident was Gerolmo, a student in
the New York public school system at the time. The screenwriter said
the incident had a powerful effect on his way of thinking.
   ``It was the first time I ever considered that our country could
be wrong,'' Gerolmo said.
   The film stars Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman star as FBI agents
who try to find the bodies of the missing workers and overcome
fierce local resistance to solve the crime.
   In a more offbeat and outrageous way, John Waters' ``Hairspray''
discusses integration in Baltimore in 1963 when a group of
teen-agers tries to break down the barriers of a segregated dance
show.
   Also set in Baltimore is Barry Levinson's ``Tin Men,'' starring
Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss as two slick aluminum siding
salesmen in the early '60s. The movie mirrored a squarely
middle-class culture, one that was not caught up in sex, politics
and drugs.
   Instead of focusing on a well-known historic event,
writer-director Ernest Thompson takes a more personal approach in
``1969.'' Robert Downey Jr. and Keifer Sutherland star as college
students who battle their parents and each other over sex, drugs and
the Vietnam War.
   ``I was 19 in 1969. It was a fulcrum time for me,'' said
Thompson, who was a student at American University at the time. ``I
think it was just the right time in my growth as an artist and as a
man to try to write about something that happened in my youth.''
   ``Running on Empty'' takes place in the '80s but the '60s are
much in evidence. Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti play anti-war
activists who sabatoged a napalm plant in 1970 and are forced to
live underground with their two children.
   Naomi Foner, who wrote ``Running on Empty'' and also served as
the film's executive producer, grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., the
daughter of sociologists. Her own experiences made Foner well
qualified to give ``Running on Empty'' its strong political theme.
   ``I lived through that time and I've wanted to find the right way
to present it to this generation,'' said Foner, a member of the
radical Students for a Democratic Society while attending graduate
school at Columbia University.
   Foner, who also taught in Harlem's Head Start program and helped
register voters in South Carolina, said many young people are
curious about what happened in the '60s.
   ``A lot of them think it was an exciting time that they were
sorry to have missed,'' she said.
   Brofenbrenner said movies are a good indicator of the concerns of
the general public: ``The principle impact of the media is that they
reflect the values of the larger society.
   ``Film is a very powerful art medium,'' he said. ``I believe it
very accurately reflects not only the prevailing but the coming
trends. It's because film writers, like other writers, are
perceptive people. They get the message of what's going on.''

<HEAD>On Wednesday, George Bush Will Declare Himself Elected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At 1 p.m. on Wednesday, Vice President George
Bush will enter the House of Representatives and announce he has
been elected president, 426 to 111, fulfilling a ritual that has
been called constitutional Russian roulette.
   Bush's declaration to a joint session of Congress will come after
the counting of the only ballots that really count under the
Constitution, those cast by the 538 members of the Electoral College.
   Yes, it's true that Bush won 53.4 percent of the popular votes,
defeating his Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis, who captured 45.6
percent. It's true he got more than 7 million votes more than his
opponent.
   But under the Constitution, the voting in November was only a
preliminary round. The voters in fact only elected electors.
   The election is over with the counting on Wednesday of ballots
cast by the electors on Dec. 20, when they met in their state
capitals.
   There was one surprise: West Virginia elector Margaret Leach cast
her ballot for Lloyd Bentsen for president and Dukakis for vice
president, reversing the order of the Democratic ticket.
   ``I did it for a reason, and the reaseon was to make a statement
about the Electoral College, said Leach, a nurse in Huntington,
W.Va. ``It was fine then (when it was established), but we've
outgrown it.''
   No other democracy in the world does it quite this way.
   As one might suspect, the process is the result of a compromise,
one of the very first compromises in the 200-year history of the
United States under the Constitution.
   In August 1787, the constitutional convention meeting in
Philadelphia found itself unable to agree on a method of selecting
the president.
   Direct popular election was opposed by delegates who feared that
most people would not know enough about the candidates to make a
wise choice. Other objections were raised to proposals that Congress
select the president or that state legislatures do it.
   A committee was appointed and it hammered together a solution.
   The solution: Each state would appoint presidential electors
equal to the total number of its senators and representatives in
Congress.
   In present day terms, that comes to 435 members of the House of
Representatives and 100 members of the Senate plus three electoral
votes for the District of Columbia.
   On Election Day, the voters of each state actually choose
electors pledged to the candidate of their choice and selected by
state party organizations.
   To win election, a presidential candidate must receive 270
electoral votes, an absolute majority.
   If no candidate scores that high, the winner is picked by the
House of Representatives from the three top vote getters. In that
process, each state delegation casts just one vote. The elections of
1800 and 1824 were decided that way.
   If no vice presidential candidate gets a majority, the victor is
chosen by the Senate from the top two. The last time that happened
was in 1836.
   Under the original system, the candidate receiving the largest
number of electoral votes was elected president; the runner up
became vice president.
   In 1800 the electors made a mistake. They gave equal numbers of
votes to Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, a result that forced the
contest into the House where it took 36 ballots to settle the issue
in Jefferson's favor.
   The 12th amendment to the Constitution, enacted four year later,
provided for separate votes for president and vice president, ending
the possibility of a repeat performance.
   Electoral ballots are first counted and certified in each state
capitol.
   The certificates are opened in the House of Representives by the
vice president, acting in his constitutional role as president of
the Senate.
   Four tellers, two from the House, two from the Senate, count the
votes of each state's electors, then hand the tally to the vice
president who announces them in alphabetical order.
   In theory, it is quite possible for someone other than Bush or
Vice President-elect Dan Quayle to be the winner.
   It won't happen. But it could.
   So-called ``faithless electors'' have voted from time to time for
candidates other than those to which they were pledged, as West
Virginia's Leach did this time around.
   The League of Women voters points out that faithless electors
could cause a candidate who had won the popular vote to wind up one
or two votes short in the Electoral College.
   And in a close election, perhaps one in which the votes are split
by a third party, it is possible that the candidate with the largest
popular vote might lose in the Electoral College. This could happen
because of the winner-take-all rule in which the candidate who wins
most of the votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral
votes.
   Over the years, atttempts have been made to shut down the
Electoral College, replacing it, perhaps, with a system of direct
election.
   In 1968, the late Rep. Hale Boggs, D-La., said there was ``a
crying need to amend the Constitution and once and for all get rid
of this anachronistic system which every four years puts us in the
position of playing Russian roulette with the election of the
president of the United States.''
   One proposal would eliminate the winner-take-all aspects of the
Electoral College by awarding electoral votes by congressional
districts with only two electors chosen on a statewide basis.
   Former Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., fought a long but ultimately
unsuccessful battle to enact a constitutional amendment providing
for the direct election of the president and vice president by
abolishing the electoral system.
   Under that proposal, the pair of candidates with the most votes
would be elected if they received at least 40 percent of the ballots
nationwide. A runoff election would be required if no slate received
40 percent.
   The runoff provision was the focus of most objections and the
Senate defeated the proposed amendment in 1979.
   There are those who think it would be a mistake to scrap the
Electoral College.
   That argument was made in the 1971 book ``The Case Against Direct
Election of the President, A Defense of the Electoral College,'' by
Judith Best.
   Acknowledging the present system is not perfect, she said it may
have a silver lining.
   ``The prospect of a runner-up presidency, the prospect of winning
the popular but not the electoral vote, spurs (the) parties to seek
the support of broad cross sections of the nation,'' she wrote.
``The risk of a runner-up presidency may not be too great a price to
pay for a system which minimizes conflicts, promises stability,
suppresses factions, promotes moderation and requires a broad base
of support.''
   As a whole, she said, the Electoral College system has succeeded,
never failing to fill the office of the president.
   ``Like all living things it has imperfections and defects, but it
functions, indeed it thrives,'' she said.

<HEAD>Shining Path Guerrillas Becoming an Urban Force</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUAYCAN, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shining Path guerrillas, who started their
bloody uprising in the mountains eight years ago, are moving into
the shantytowns that encircle the capital like a noose.
   Abimael Guzman, founder of the rebel movement, has said of the
slums and their people: ``The immense masses of the shantytowns are
like belts of steel that lock in the enemy and hold back his
reactionary forces.''
   His Maoist rebels, once secretive fanatics, are becoming a
political force that seeks public support in Huaycan and the other
makeshift communities where two-thirds of Lima's 7 million people
scrape along.
   About 10,000 people live in Huaycan. Their huts built of straw
mats line the bone-dry slopes of the Andean foothills 15 miles east
of downtown Lima.
   Most residents are poor migrants from the violent highlands where
the rebel movement was born. They make ideal recruits for the
Shining Path _ Sendero Luminoso in Spanish.
   Shining Path's move into a more public role, and through most of
Peru from its Andean base in Ayacucho province, has coincided with
economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2,000 percent.
   In the cities, the guerrillas combine conventional politics with
terror. In the countryside, they make ever-bolder attacks on the
military.
   Rebel columns strike along the spine of the Andes from the
Ecuadorean frontier in the north to Bolivia in the south. The
guerrillas also work with drug traffickers in Peru's eastern jungle,
source of the raw material for much of the world's cocaine, and buy
sophisticated weapons with the profits.
   More than 12,000 people have been killed in the civil war, most
of them Andean peasants slain by rebels or security forces, and
official figures put damage to the shattered economy at $10 billion.
   The guerrillas are believed to have only about 5,000 armed
combatants, so they do not appear close to seizing power, but there
is increasing pessimism about the prospects of controlling them.
   ``Most evaluations of Sendero Luminoso's eight-year expansion
under the democratic system ... have become increasingly grim,'' the
Andean Report, a respected economic journal, said recently.
   One reason the movement grows is its appeal to Peru's Indians,
subjected for centuries to scorn and discrimination by the white
ruling elite.
   ``Political violence in Peru is not the result of poverty alone
but of humiliation, oppression, hate between classes, racism,'' Sen.
Enrique Bernales, chairman of a committee on violence, said when it
released a report in September.
   The most striking development of the last 18 months has been the
Shining Path's move into public view in this grimy capital on South
America's Pacific coast.
   Rebels organize support groups in the slums, infiltrate labor
unions, organize marches, spread their message of revolution with
the aid of a sympathetic daily newspaper and agitate among
university students.
   Analysts and experts on counterinsurgency say Shining Path
appears bent on dominating the radical left of legal politics.
   Officials have become alarmed by the broadening of tactics to
include infiltration of legitimate organizations, including unions
of government workers. They say this clouds distinctions between the
legal and illegal left, making it move difficult to combat the rebel
movement.
   ``Sendero is seeking semi-legal status as a way of winning
militants and sympathizers, while at the same time generating a
confusing situation in which the security forces indiscrimately
repress members of the legal left along with leftist insurgents,'' a
ranking police official said privately.
   Guzman, a Marxist philosophy professor, founded Sendero Luminoso
in 1970 in Ayacucho, an Andean state capital 230 miles southeast of
Lima where he had built a following at the University of Huamanga.
   Followers call Guzman, 54, ``the fourth sword of Marxism'' after
Marx, Lenin and Mao.
   His movement, a splinter group of the Communist Party, gathered
strength in Indian communities of the southern Andes for 10 years
before launching its guerrilla war.
   According to counterinsurgency experts, the guerrillas switched
their emphasis to the cities because migration of Indian peasants to
urban centers accelerated after the highlands became a battlefield.
   Guzman's guerrillas have followed tens of thousands of peasants
from the Andes into Lima's shantytowns and see the slums as a new
stronghold.
   In July, the pro-Shining Path newspaper El Diario published a
48-page report on the guerrilla movement. It quoted Guzman as saying
in his first interview since going underground in 1980:
   ``We had to follow the road from the countryside to the city. We
must prepare for the insurrection that is coming, which means the
taking of the cities.''
   He said conditions were ripe for the next stage in the struggle
for power: inciting a coup against President Alan Garcia by
provoking economic chaos and increasing attacks on the army.
   The final stage, he said, would be a popular uprising against a
repressive military regime.
   Shining Path has infiltrated 167 unions and neighborhood
associations in the Lima slums this year, says a confidential
Interior Ministry report obtained by The Associated Press.
   Guerrillas threaten and sometimes kill community leaders,
establish ``people's schools'' and set up ``street theaters'' for
propaganda, it said.
   Cardinal Juan Landazuri of the Roman Catholic Church said:
``Priests tell me that young people in the shantytowns are going
over to Sendero. I have been in a shantytown where there is a
Shining Path group, and the police are doing nothing about it.''
   Huaycan is one of the slums where Shining Path works hardest
because it is just off the Central Highway, a strategic route
through the capital's main industrial zone to the mountains. The
industrial zone contains 850 of the country's most important
factories.
   Red-painted slogans hailing the ``People's War'' and ``President
Gonzalo,'' the rebel name for Guzman, cover the concrete-block
clinic, other buildings with solid walls and even large rocks.
   Residents were suspicious and uncommunicative when an Associated
Press reporter visited, except for three 10-year-old boys at the
entrance who laughed and waved red flags with the Shining Path's
hammer-and-sickle emblem.
   The Central Highway passes through what looks like a military
zone. Most factories are behind high walls topped with barbed wire
and towers from which guards with automatic rifles keep watch.
   Guerrillas killed three plant managers in 1988 who were involved
in labor disputes. Union leaders also are uneasy.
   ``I doubt if you'll find any union leader ... who will declare he
is a Senderista, but I'll bet you'll find many who are afraid to say
anything against Sendero,'' an American labor adviser said on
condition of anonymity.
   The highway ties Lima to the agricultural lands of the central
Andes and Peru's most important mines, where unions threatened by
the Shining Path have conducted a strike since late October that
costs millions of dollars a day in export earnings.

   A paramilitary death squad has made its
appearance in Peru, where terror and violence grow as the economy
collapses.
   Opposition politicians claim the Rodrigo Franco Command, named
for a government official killed by Shining Path guerrillas in 1987,
has links to President Alan Garcia's populist Aprista party. He and
other officials deny it. The group is blamed for at least two
murders. It has claimed responsibility for death threats and
bombings aimed at both conservative critics of the government and
people suspected of supporting the Maoist rebels.
   Its first appearance was in July, with the kidnap and murder of a
lawyer who defended Osman Morote, considered No. 2 man to Abimael
Guzman in Shining Path. The Rodrigo Franco Command claimed
responsibility.
   Police also blame it for the killing of a university professor
who had openly expressed support for the rebels.
   Other actions of the paramilitary group include:
   _Bombing the tomb of guerrilla leader Edith Lagos in Ayacucho,
birthplace of Shining, and threatening Carlos Escobar, a prosecutor
investigating reports of an army massacre of peasants believed
sympathetic to the rebels.
   _Making threats to several Ayacucho journalists about their
reporting on the guerrilla war and bombing the Lima homes of staff
members of El Diario, a newspaper that supports the rebels.
   One of its statements said: ``For every murdered mayor, soldier
or policeman, a leader of the Shining Path or its support groups
will die.''
   Garcia's government announced an investigation in November, after
the Rodrigo Franco Command bombed the home of news magazine
publisher Franciso Igartua and threatened an opposition senator and
two leading journalists, who are critics of the government but not
leftists.
   Whoever leads the paramilitary group ``must be a fool who
believes he is helping the government,'' Garcia said at the time.
   No arrests have been made and the organization's leaders have not
been identified.

<DATELINE>BEIT OREN, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new kibbutzniks may not be yuppies
yet, but some of Israel's socialist communes are modifying the
collective life with white-collar jobs, privacy and self-fulfillment.
   Beit Oren, one of the oldest communal farms, is leading the
experiment with ideas that were anathema to the pioneers: private
ownership, paying salaries and letting members choose their own jobs.
   The kibbutz perches on a ridge Carmel Mountains in the forest for
which it is named. Immigrants from Romania and elsewhere in Eastern
Europe founded Beit Oren in 1939.
   They brought to it the utopian concept of a work collective,
inspired by the Russian revolution. The communes were not only
social experiments, but tools for taming the land and changing the
Jew's image from ghetto dweller to farmer.
   Members worked, ate and slept on the farm. They shared equally
both the kitchen and nursery tasks and outside labor in cattle pens
and citrus groves.
   Status was a reward for hard work. The communes were known for
producing the toughest soldiers and most upright officials and
politicians.
   Gradually over the past two decades, kibbutz life has changed.
   Many have eased the rules that all money and property be shared
equally. Members now have such personal luxuries as color
televisions and microwave ovens, and more hold private jobs off the
farm.
   Changes being debated throughout the network are more
fundamental, and Beit Oren is in the forefront of those redefining
the nature of kibbutz life.
   It also has a special motivation: the need to attract new members
who can help erase a $6.5 million debt that nearly forced the
settlement to close in 1987.
   If the experiment works, it could be adopted by the approximately
300 other collective farms in Israel, which suffer from a flight of
young people to the cities and a combined debt of nearly $4 billion.
   Beit Oren's leaders believe the main drawback of collective
farms, where only about 3 percent of Israel's 4.2 million people
live, is their failure to recognize a change in social emphasis from
self-sacrifice to self-fulfillment. They say young people want
material rewards and more exctiting careers.
   ``We are trying to make a better kibbutz by changing the role of
the individual,'' said Zeev Shabtai, 48. ``It used to be that the
individual worked for the collective. This is over. People no longer
want to be a tool. Let's allow the society to be the tool.''
   Promises of change have doubled the number of residents to 110 at
Beit Oren, just south of port city of Haifa. About one-third work
outside the kibbutz at ranging from marketing to teaching.
   Others soon will earn salaries for working in the commune. All
socialist principles have not disappeared, however, so pay will be
the same no matter what the job.
   Kibbutz members will be free to spend their money as they choose,
even to squander it on such capitalist luxuries as vacations abroad
or stereo equipment.
   Under the old system all income, regardless of source, went into
the kibbutz treasury to be shared by all.
   Beit Oren usually would buy televisions, for example, only when
it could afford one for each family. Using kibbutz cars for
vacations was a matter of strict scheduling and travel abroad was
rare.
   In exchange for the new freedom, Beit Oren plans to charge
individual members for such things as electricity, water and food
rather than paying the bills collectively. Shabtai said the main
purpose is to reduce waste.
   ``This will make people feel more responsible,'' he said. ``The
way it is now, people figure if I go through a red light the kibbutz
pays the fine. Unlimited collective responsibility simply brings
corruption.''
   Kibbutz leaders envision commuter communes and hope to attract
urban professionals.
   ``Today the whole kibbutz movement is moving toward this
change,'' said Beit Oren's secretary, Shmuel Cohen. ``The young
generation doesn't find the same challenge on the kibbutz as they
used to, and we need to bring them back.''
   Zvi Carmi, 67, a founder of Beit Oren, expressed disappointment
that his three children left it, but said he hopes more free
enterprise will reverse the trend.
   ``The kibbutz was born into a reality of material poverty and
ideological wealth,'' he said. ``Today, spiritualism and vision is
lacking. The cities are very tempting. We are surrounded by a
private lifestyle. People want their own careers.''
   One young urbanite who found his niche is Yoel Kadish, 30, who
has three children and came to Beit Oren from a Tel Aviv suburb to
start a factory that makes relief maps.
   ``This is something really new, Zionism 1988 _ a different
approach to life, to be an individual and in a collective,'' he said.
   ``In the city, there's too much social isolation. This is what I
always wanted, but with more privacy.''

<TEXT>
   The morning light comes late and slowly in
Dublin in December, but it perseveres. It seems a fitting metaphor
for Ireland's economy as it emerges from a long darkness.
   After a particularly harsh recession, Ireland is enjoying a
revival spurred by Prime Minister Charles Haughey's fiscal austerity.
   The turnaround is showing up in a moderate but steady economic
growth rate, lower interest rates, a trade surplus. Even the
unemployment rate is inching down from near 20 percent.
   Ireland is improving physically as well. Dublin got a facelift
during its millennium celebrations this year, and a huge financial
center is being built on derelict docklands.
   But critics complain that the improvements in this small, green
island republic of 3.4 million people are not filtering through to
the jobless and destitute, some so poor they have no bathrooms and
feed their children corn flakes for dinner.
   The Irish continue to emigrate at an estimated 32,000 a year, or
1 percent of the population, the highest level since the 1950s. That
sometimes is cited as a contributing factor in the declining
unemployment rate, although it has not been quantified.
   Others say the future is clouded by impatience for bigger and
better results and by uncertainty introduced by the prime minister's
ill health. Haughey, 62, has been repeatedly hospitalized for kidney
stones and a severe respiratory infection this year.
   The conflict in Northern Ireland, the British-ruled one-sixth of
the island, also casts a shadow over relations between Ireland and
Britain, its biggest trading partner, and the vicissitudes of modern
life intrude on Ireland's traditional, conservative culture.
   ``1988 is going to be one of the greatest years, from the point
of view from the Irish economy, for at least 20 years,'' Haughey
said in a recent speech to the Fianna Fail, his political party.
``We are ready to make a major advance in the Irish economy in the
next three years.''
   Even Michael Noonan, finance spokesman for the principal
opposition party, Fine Gael, said in an interview, ``Things are
improving.
   ``They have our support on the main economic policies.''
   However, Noonan added: ``The improvement of the economy is not
felt in the day-to-day lives of people. That is something that, if
it doesn't change, will affect the consensus.''
   Most dramatic has been Haughey's transformation from big spender
to budget slasher. When he became prime minister for the third time
following the February 1987 election, he moved quickly to cut
Ireland's runaway public borrowing for social services it couldn't
afford.
   Such spending had begun a debt spiral a decade ago, and the
economy worsened severely with the oil-price rises of the 1970s.
   Haughey, by the second year of his five-year term, has restrained
public expenditure to cut public borrowing to about 5 percent of
gross national product from a 1981 peak of 15 percent.
   The moves were made possible by the unusual political consensus
between the minority government and the principal opposition.
Indeed, many of Haughey's remedies are precisely those advocated by
Noonan's Fine Gael during its 1982-87 term of office.
   Fine Gael under Haughey's predecessor, Garret FitzGerald,
governed in coalition with the socialist Labor Party, which
constantly hampered Fine Gael's austerity programs and finally
brought the government down in a dispute over cuts in welfare
spending.
   The present minority government owes its survival partly to
Haughey's personal charisma, partly to Fine Gael's knowledge that if
the government fell now, it would be re-elected with an increased
majority.
   An opinion poll published in the Irish Times in December gave
Haughey's party a 51-percent approval rating, its highest since the
last election, against 26 percent for the opposition.
   Said economist Jim O'Leary of Davy Stockbrokers, Dublin's largest
investment firm: ``One of the best things that has happened to this
country in the last three or four years is that we have a situation
that the major parties have arrived at a consensus about economic
policy.''
   Although specific cutbacks have worsened unemployment, dampened
consumer spending and drawn vociferous opposition from affected
groups, the Irish generally support the tight grip as a much-needed
measure, and confidence has been bolstered, experts said.

   The government has also begun to reform Ireland's high taxes by
bringing more people into the lowest income tax rate of 35 percent.
But annual earnings above 11,500 pounds ($17,700) remain subject to
an extraordinary marginal rate of 58 percent.
   At the same time, a tax amnesty in the past year has earned the
government a 500 million-pound ($770 million) windfall.
   The government plans to relax exchange rate controls at the
beginning of 1989, signaling confidence that the economy is strong
enough for funds not to flee the country.
   Private economists expect the economic growth rate to be about 3
percent when all the figures are in for 1988, and the same for 1989,
after a 4.8 percent spurt in 1987.
   The economy, dominated by chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
electronics, light engineering and agriculture, has been boosted by
strong exports, some of which come from the many foreign-owned
plants Ireland has attracted.
   Exports increased 13.3 percent in 1987 to give Ireland its first
current account surplus in 20 years.
   Interest rates have declined to 8.5 percent from 14 percent in
early 1987 and annual inflation is running at a 28-year-low of about
2.1 percent, which is expected to hold steady, compared with 20
percent in 1981.
   Those improvements have encouraged consumer spending 3 percent
higher in 1988, after a flat 1987. They also have encouraged some
investment and fueled a housing boom.
   Unemployment has dropped below 18 percent, to about 234,000
jobless people, from a peak of 19.4 percent in January 1987, and
should continue declining.
   But the big problems remain.
   Largely rural Ireland is still northern Europe's poorest country,
with per capita gross domestic product of $5,123 in 1987, according
to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. It is one of the lowest figures in the 24-member group.
   The Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin says 1
million people are poor. Other studies show that nearly 40 percent
of the population depends to some degree on social welfare payments.
   ``It's hard for any mother to face that, to keep saying, `No,
no,''' Martha Carrig, a mother from Newmarket-on-Fergus, said in a
recent documentary on poverty aired on RTE, the state television
network.
   An unidentified Waterford woman told RTE: ``There are people
hungry in this country. You come down and live with us and tell us
we're not hungry.''
   Unemployment is Ireland's No. 1 economic and social problem,
critics say. It is exacerbated by the high birth rates in a
93-percent Roman Catholic country where most forms of contraception
are illegal, by rigid labor union contracts, and by an emphasis on
free education that has produced more students than there are
taxpayers.
   With no jobs to go to, college graduates areamong the first to
emigrate.
   ``People are voting with their feet. The ultimate vote of no
confidence is to leave the country,'' says Brendan Walsh, an
economics professor at University College, Dublin.
   Ireland also is shadowed by the Protestant-Catholic feuding in
Northern Ireland, where more than 2,700 people have died since 1969
and the outlawed Irish Republican Army fights with bombs and bullets
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Irish
Republic.
   One-third of the army's $385 million annual defense budget goes
to policing the border against the IRA, and the police spend a
similar amount. Although the violence hardly ever spills into the
Irish Republic, officials are convinced it hurts tourism.
   In addition, Ireland's traditional self-image as a Christian,
moral and safe place is being battered by violent crime, drug abuse
and women flocking to Britain to seek abortions, Walsh said.
Abortion and divorce are banned in the constitution.
   But for all the difficulties, there is hope.
   ``It now looks like we've turned the corner,'' said Joe Durkan,
one of Ireland's leading economists, who works for the accounting
firm Coopers and Lybrand in Dublin. ``There's no reason the economy
should not do very, very well. It's going to go foreward.''

   A food-store millionaire, LBJ's son-in-law, a
folksy farm broadcaster, a Vietnam war hero: These are a few of the
11 new senators who will take their place when the 101st Congress
convenes on Tuesday.
   The new senators will spend their first weeks hiring staff,
settling into their new offices and generally learning the ropes.
   Seven of the 11 were trained as lawyers. Four are congressmen.
Three were or are governors of their states. One is his state's
attorney general.
   One was appointed to the job to fill the seat of the vice
president-elect.
   Six are Republicans and five are Democrats. The latter join the
majority side of the aisle, where their party holds 55 seats to the
opposition's 45.
   Joining the majority Democrats are:

<HEAD>Richard A. Bryan of Nevada</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Bryan, 51, has been Nevada's Democratic governor since 1983,
mounting a stubborn running battle against federal efforts to locate
a nuclear waste dump in the state. He is expected to continue that
fight in the Senate.
   A lawyer, Bryan has had a long public career, beginning as a
county public defender and prosecutor. He served in the Nevada state
Assembly and Senate, then won election as state attorney general. He
was re-elected to a second term as governor in 1986 with 72 percent
of the vote.
   His popularity stems in part from his diversification of Nevada's
tourist economy and for his efforts to revamp the state education
system.
   Bryan defeated Sen. Chic Hecht, a one-term Republican, to win his
Senate seat.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Bob Kerrey of Nebraska</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Kerrey, 45, a former Nebraska governor, is a combat veteran of
Vietnam who later became an outspoken opponent of the war.
   He lost a leg below the knee in 1969 while leading a Navy
commando raid on a North Vietnamese listening post.
   The injury hospitalized him for months. Later, as his opposition
to the war deepened, he almost refused to accept the Congressional
Medal of Honor from President Richard Nixon.
   Returning to Nebraska, he built a thriving chain of restaurants
and health clubs and, despite his war injury, ran in marathons using
an artificial leg.
   Kerrey is perhaps best known outside his native state for his
social life: He dated actress Debra Winger for a time.
   He first ventured into politics in 1982 and, in an upset,
unseated Republican Gov. Charles Thone.
   As governor he eliminated a large budget deficit, and fought for
changes in banking law and in the state education system.
   Although he was a clear favorite for re-election, Kerrey
announced in 1985 he would take time out from politics.
   He rejoined the fray in a challenge to Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb.,
who had been appointed to the job to fill a vacancy.
   Karnes handed Kerrey a major political windfall during the
campaign in one of the nation's most agricultural states. He
announced that ``we need fewer farmers.''

<HEAD>Herb Kohl of Wisconsin</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Kohl, 53, comes to the Senate as one of its richest members and
as a successful businessman, but with no previous experience in
public office.
   He is the owner of the Milwaukee Bucks professional basketball
team. He paid $18.5 million for the team to prevent it from leaving
Milwaukee and won the thanks of Wisconsin sports fans as a result.
Kohl is also part owner of an American League baseball team, the
Milwaukee Brewers.
   Kohl's fortune is based on a string of local food stores _ now
sold _ that bear the family name. He also has extensive commercial
and real estate holdings.
   Kohl spent millions of dollars of his own money to win the
Democratic primary against rivals who included a former governor and
a sitting congressman. He spent millions more to win in November,
defeating state Sen. Susan Engeleiter.
   He will succeed William Proxmire, the independent and frugal
maverick perhaps best known to the public as the granter of the
monthly ``Golden Fleece'' award to spolight allegedly foolish
federal spending programs.
   In recent elections Proxmire shook thousands of hands throughout
the state but spent virtually no money to retain his seat and
accepted no contributions from special interests.
   Kohl didn't accept such contributions either. He didn't have to.
But his wealth gave him a certain independence akin to Proxmire's.
   His campaign slogan: ``Nobody's senator but yours.''

<HEAD>Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Lieberman, 46, took on three-term Republican veteran Lowell
Weicker, a fiery and liberal independent, and beat him by a nose.
   A career politician, Lieberman was elected to the Connecticut
state Senate in 1971 and served as its majority leader from 1975 to
1981. He was elected the state's attorney general in 1983.
   In the Senate campaign he proved conservative enough to attract
Republican voters unhappy with Weicker and liberal enough to hold
most Democrats.
   He portrayed Weicker as unresponsive to Connecticut's needs and
some of his television commercials were cartoons portraying the
physically imposing senator as a sleeping bear.
   In contrast with Weicker, he said he supported U.S. military
actions in Grenada and Libya. He advocated a moment of silence in
public schools in lieu of prayer.
   In his two terms as attorney general he cultivated an image as
``the people's lawyer,'' trying to help consumers and taking on
hazardous waste and pollution issues.
   During the campaign he said he supported federal spending for
environmental protection, AIDS research and education.

<HEAD>Charles Robb of Virginia</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Robb, 49, built a record of fiscal conservativism and liberal
social policies as governor of Virginia, while concentrating on such
issues as education, transportation and welfare improvements.
   Married to the daughter of the late President Lyndon B. Johnson,
Robb served as a Marine Corps officer in Vietnam.
   He was elected Virginia's lieutenant governor in 1977, the only
Democrat to win statewide office that year. He was elevated to the
governorship four years later in a Democratic sweep of the state's
top three offices.
   After his own term ended, he was widely credited for helping pave
the way for the 1985 election of Democratic Gov. Gerald Bailes and a
ticket that included a black lieutenant governor and a female
attorney general.
   While Robb has declared he has no intention of doing anything but
serve his six-year Senate term and run for re-election, he is on
most short lists of potential presidential candidates in 1992 or
1996.
   
   Republicans joining the Senate's minority are:

<HEAD>Conrad Burns of Montana</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Burns, 53, a rumpled, folksy farm broadcaster, squeezed past
incumbent Democrat John Melcher to win a Senate seat.
   Burn's victory represented a major political promotion from his
present job as a commissioner of Yellowstone County.
   Burns is a co-founder of the Northern Agricultural Network and
his broadcasts and subsequent success as an after-dinner speaker won
him statewide popularity.
   During the campaign, he accused Melcher of having a
disproportionate interest in the affairs of the Philippines _ which
he visited three times in five years. He also may have been helped
by President Reagan's veto of a Melcher-sponsored Montana wilderness
bill.

   He was elected to fill Quayle's House seat after Quayle's

   In Congress, his record has been described as conservative,
Christian-based and pro-family.
   He has served as the senior GOP member on the Select Committee on
Children, Youth and Families.
   He became identified with the issue of school prayer, trying in
1984 to attach an amendment to an education bill to cut off federal
aid to schools and states banning voluntary school prayer. It was

   Gorton, 60, returns to the Senate after a political rebirth in

publicity about his decision to vote for Senate confirmation of
Daniel Manion for a seat on a federal appeals court in exchange for
the Reagan administration's nomination of a friend to be a federal
judge in Washington state.
   Sen. Daniel Evans's surprise decision not to seek re-election
opened a new chance for Gorton.
   He warmed up his speaking style, asked pardon for his judge-swap
decision and made other changes.
   In the end he defeated five-term Rep. Mike Lowry and regained a
Senate seat.
   Gorton served in the Washington House for a decade beginning in
1959 and was its majority leader for his last two years. A lawyer,
he served as the state's attorney general from 1969 to 1981.

   Jeffords has been a House maverick. Some call him a gadfly. He
does not follow his party's line in many cases. In 1981 he voted
against President Reagan more often than any other Republican member
of the House. That included voting against Reagan's 1981 tax bill.
   The following year he was elbowed aside by other Republicans and
denied a chance to become the ranking GOP member of the House
Agriculture Committee, in large part because of his independent
voting record.
   He became, instead, ranking GOP member of the Education and Labor
Committee where he supported student loans and job training
legislation and, in another break with the GOP, backed a plan to
soften the blow of plant closings on workers.
   Jeffords also opposed aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, voting
against key Reagan vetoes and opposing limits on abortion.
   He holds a bachelor's degree from Yale University and a law
degree from Harvard Law School.

<HEAD>Trent Lott of Mississippi</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Lott, 47, gave up the No. 2 Republican leadership post in the
House to run for the Senate seat being vacated by the venerable John
Stennis, a Democrat who had held it for 41 years.
   He won handily, defeating Rep. Wayne Dowdy.
   Lott began his political life as a Democrat, serving as
administrative assistant to Democratic Rep. William Colmer.
   When Colmer retired in 1972, at age 82, Lott jumped into the race
to succeed him, registering as a Republican at the same time.
   He said he was ``tired of the Muskies and the Kennedys and the
Humphreys and the whole lot'' and vowed to ``fight against the
ever-increasing efforts of the so-called liberals to concentrate
more power in the government in Washington.''
   As House minority whip, Lott played a key role in keeping GOP
lawmakers in line and the Democratic majority at bay, at least as
much as that was possible.
   He won the job in 1981, with some observers crediting his victory
more to his personal geniality than to an impressive legislative
record.

   Mack, 48, a conservative stalwart and a member of the House since
1983, edged past Rep. Buddie McKay for the Senate seat being vacated
by Sen. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat.
   He bears a famous name.
   And it is not his real one.
   The real name is Cornelius McGillicuddy III, after his
grandfather, the famous owner and manager of the Philadelphia
Athletics baseball team, who also was known as Connie Mack.
   Mack has ancestral roots in Congress.
   A great grandfather served in the House as a Texas Democrat. A
grandfather moved to the Senate after a short stay in the House and
remained there 28 years. His step-grandfather, Tom C. Connally,
served Texas in the Senate for 24 years.
   Mack was the president of a bank when he ran for Congress,
campaigning after his victory for a seat on the House Budget
Committee.
   In the House, he also became a member of the Conservative
Opportunity Society, a confrontational band of young and aggressive
House Republicans.
   ``In politics you gain from confrontation,'' Mack said.

   Sales of existing homes rose 1.1 percent in
November, the first advance since August, according to a real estate
trade group.
   Analysts credited the rebound, in part, to the strong
participation of baby boomers in the housing market, saying their
numbers alone should help keep sales steady in 1989 despite
forecasts of higher mortgage rates.
   The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that existing
single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.71 million units in November, compared to an October sales pace
of 3.67 million units.

<HEAD>S&P Forecasts Big Slowdown In Corporate Profit Growth Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate profit growth will slow sharply in 1989
for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, reflecting a
national economic slowdown, the business information concern said.
   Profits for S&P 500 companies should rise by about 11 percent
from 1988, compared with an estimated gain of 41 percent this year,
according to an S&P study released Tuesday.
   Overall economic growth next year should slow to about two-thirds
of its 1988 pace, curbing corporate profits, said S&P Chief
Economist David M. Blitzer.
   The nation's gross national product _ the broadest measure of
economic growth _ grew at an average rate of just under 3 percent
during the first nine months of this year. The rate was curbed
slightly because of the effects of the summer drought on the
nation's farm production.
   ``Slower growth in exports and business capital spending, along
with higher interest rates, will retard economic expansion,''
Blitzer said. ``When economic growth slows, profit gains are one of
the first places to feel it.''
   S&P's annual corporate profit study indicated most major industry
groups would see profit growth of between 10 percent and 15 percent,
although auto industry profits are expected to decline.
   Blitzer said increasing wage pressures and rising interest
expenses during the first half of the year are two factors that
could narrow profits in 1989. Higher interest rates and weaker
earnings prospects also could depress stock prices, as investors
pursue increasingly attractive returns in fixed-income investments
such as bonds.
   But at the same time, lower stock valuations may not trigger a
bull market, he said. Stock prices currently are at roughly 10 times
S&P's projected 1989 corporate earnings, down significantly from
1987's highs but ``not low enough to suggest a mad rush into
stocks,'' Blitzer said.
   Standard & Poor's analysts indicated earnings growth would be
strongest in the drug and pharmaceutical sector, where profits were
expected to rise by 19 percent in 1989, matching the estimated
growth for this year because of firmer pricing, stable raw material
costs and a weak dollar that will aid drug makers' foreign
operations.
   Among other highlighted industries:
   _Retailing profits were expected to rise by 12 percent to 15
percent, indicating increased consumer spending spurred by more
popular fashions and relatively moderate price increases;
   _Profits for the Big Three domestic automakers were expected to
decline by 4 percent, due to an expected 2 percent drop in sales
amid heightened competition that could include profit-curbing sales
incentives;
   _Money center bank profits should be flat, as those companies
seek ways to meet new regulatory capital guidelines, while regional
bank holding companies could see 9 percent to 10 percent earnings
growth;
   _The semiconductor industry should continue its recovery from a
mid-1980s slump, although profits will grow only about 10 percent
due to increased worldwide production capacity and renewed foreign
competition;
   _Profit growth should be in the ``respectable'' 10 percent range
for railroads and chemical companies, with railroads benefiting from
their workforce streamlinings of recent years and chemical makers
enjoying record worldwide demand, low crude oil prices and the weak
dollar.

<HEAD>Japanese Workers Gain Average 4.4 Percent Wage Hike in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average Japanese worker got a 4.4 percent pay
raise in 1988, or about $75 more each month, the Labor Ministry said
Tuesday.
   A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the increase was higher than last year's 3.6 percent, the lowest
since the annual wage survey began in 1965. The highest was 29.3
percent in 1974.
   The official attributed this year's rise to recovery from a
business slump last year triggered by the yen's rapid appreciation
against the U.S. dollar. The higher yen makes Japanese goods more
expensive abroad and has hurt companies heavily dependent on exports.
   For its wage increase figure, the official said the ministry
questioned 3,200 private companies with 100 employes or more at
random in September. Japanese wage bargaining is conducted in the
spring.
   The official said that in 1987, the average monthly wage for a
Japanese worker in a company with 30 employees or more was $2,710,
including overtime, bonuses and allowances. Such workers account for
about half of Japan's total work force of 44 million.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs
increased by 10 to total 940, marking the third straight week of
gains, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   Last week, the count increased by eight to total 930; the count
increased by 17 in the previous week. A year ago, the number of rigs
totaled 1,145.
   Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge said the year-end surge
capped an otherwise disappointing quarter.
   ``We normally would see a considerably greater increase than we
had in the fourth quarter,'' Kerridge said Tuesday. ``Normally, we
see an increase in drilling because companies are spending what was
left in their drilling budgets. That didn't happen this year.''
   The count averaged 922 working rigs in the fourth quarter,
usually the strongest of the year, compared to 999 in the first, 901
in the second and an average 924 rigs in the third quarter, Kerridge
said.
   ``It will probably be down again next week if it follows the
normal seasonal pattern,'' Kerridge said.
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, the biggest gains were posted
by Texas with 12 additional rigs, followed by Oklahoma, seven;
Wyoming, six; Ohio, four; and Louisiana, two.
   North Dakota had the biggest decline with six fewer rigs,
followed by California, four; Colorado, three; Michigan, two; and
New Mexico, one. Kansas and Pennsylvania were unchanged from the
previous week.

<HEAD>Paradyne, AT&T Announce Agreement For Acquisition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LARGO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. and
Paradyne Corp. today announced an agreement for the acquisition of
Paradyne's shares by AT&T for approximately $250 million.
   The Paradyne board of directors has unanimously approved the
agreement and the offer will begin later this week.
   Under the agreement, AT&T will make a tender offer for all of
Paradyne's stock at $10.25 a share in cash. AT&T will finance the
acquisition with cash from internal sources, according to a news
release from AT&T.
   An AT&T spokesman in New York was not immediately available to
comment on the action.
   Paradyne, based in Largo, develops and manufactures data
communications equipment and provides sales and service, both
domestically and overseas.
   The company ran into legal troubles last year. Paradyne pleaded
guilty in 1987 to conspiring to defraud the government and paid a
$1.2 million fine.
   The charges grew out of a computer equipment contract Paradyne
won in 1981 from the Social Security Administration. Prosecutors
claimed that the company won the contract unfairly and did not have
ready the equipment it said it had.
   The companies plan to merge the existing data communications
equipment operations of Paradyne and AT&T, with the resulting
business entity becoming a subsidiary of AT&T. John Mitcham,
president and chief executive officer of Paradyne, will head the
subsidiary.
   ``Both AT&T and Paradyne now offer strong product lines to our
customers,'' said Jack Bucter, AT&T vice president for product
management and marketing. ``Merging these lines will enable this new
AT&T subsidiary to offer an even more comprehensive line of products
and services to meet our customers' global data networking needs.''
   Paradyne had 1987 worldwide sales of $233 million, with assets
totaling $263 million. The comany has 115 locations around the
world, including manufacturing facilities in Largo and sales offices
in the United States, Britain, Canada, Japan and Hong Kong.
   The company distributes products in 47 countries and employs
2,600 people worldwide.
   AT&T had 1987 revenues of $33.6 billion and part of its business
includes the manufacture of data communications equipment in
Montgomery, Ill., for sale in the United States.
   AT&T generally does not publicly report sales, assets or
employees for most of its individual business units, including that
portion of business devoted to data communications equipment.
   The tender offer is subject to the condition that at least 50.1
percent of the Paradyne stock is tendered and not withdrawn.
Following the tender offer, Paradyne will be merged with an AT&T
subsidiary and any shareholders who did not tender their Paradyne
stock would receive the offering price of $10.25 a share.
   Paradyne also granted AT&T an option to acquire, under certain
conditions, up to 25 percent of Paradyne's stock at $10.25 a share.

   The stock market weakened marginally today in
extremely thin post-Christmas trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 1.97 points to
2,166.96 by 2 p.m. EST.
   Among broader market measurements, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 0.20 to 155.86. The
American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.86 to 301.36.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7-to-5 on the New

trading left.
   Stock strategists said they expected the market to show little
change during the week, largely because of a historical lack of
business in the period between Christmas and New Year's Day.
   Most of the trading today appeared to reflect end-of-year
portfolio adjustments by institutional money managers, as well as
some takeover-related speculation, analysts said.
   Paradyn led the Big Board's most active list, up 4} to 10 on

   The Reagan administration announced today that
it will impose trade sanctions valued at $100 million on a variety
of European food products if the European Community goes forward
with a threatened ban on imports of American meat treated with
growth hormones.
   The action would steeply increase prices of selected foreign
imports for American consumers, including some meats, beverages and
pet foods.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said higher import
duties, which would double the wholesale price for the goods
entering the United States, would go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on
Jan. 1.
   ``I regret that the United States is forced to retaliate against
the European Community's ban on meat treated by growth hormones,''
Yeutter said in a statement. ``Despite the EC's claim that the
animal hormone ban is based on health concerns, the EC has yet to
present any evidence that proper application of the growth producing
hormones in question poses any threat to human health.''
   The administration is charging that the action by the 12-nation
European Community constitutes an unfair trade practice because it
was taken without what the United States considered to be a
scientific basis.
   In Los Angeles, where President Reagan is vacationing, Deputy
White House Press Secretary Leslye Arsht said, ``We obviously feel
we must be aggressive in the trade positions we taken, but the
European Community are our allies and we are major trading partners.
   ``We have our differences over trade, but there is a mechanism
for resolving them and we have no reason to believe this one won't
be resolved also.''
   Just before Christmas, the European Community's decision-making
body, the Council of Ministers, voted to let the ban on U.S. meat
imports take effect automatically on Jan. 1, an action the countries
have been threatening to take for more than a year.
   The Europeans have warned that if the United States retaliates,
it will counter-retaliate, threatening a full-blown trade war
between two of the world's largest trading partners.
   Along with his announcement, Yeutter released a list of the
European products upon which the higher 100 percent duties will be
imposed. These products include Danish hams, Italian canned
tomatoes, beef, alcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent
alcohol, fruit juices and pet food.

<HEAD>Japan's Current-Account Surplus Higher Again In November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's current-account surplus grew during November
from a year earlier, the Finance Ministry announced Tuesday, but
officials said they still expect the gap to decline for the full
year ending March 31.
   The Finance Ministry said the surplus in the current account,
which measures trade in goods and services, grew to $6.76 billion in
November from $5.93 billion a year earlier, the second consecutive
monthly rise.
   The overall trade surplus during the month also rose, to $7.56
billion from $6.69 billion in November 1987, although imports grew
at a faster rate than exports.
   The Finance Ministry also announced that Japan's current-account
surplus with the United States in the first six months of this year
fell by 12.2 percent, to $23.7 billion from $26.9 billion in the
year-earlier period.
   The monthly current-account gap had been narrowing steadily since
January mainly as a result of a successful attempt by major
industrial countries to guide the dollar down in value against the
Japanese yen and other key currencies. A stronger yen tends to brake
Japanese exports by making them more expensive overseas.
   But despite the recent increases, Finance Ministry officials
indicated the surplus was likely to shrinkk in the fiscal year that
ends March 31. They pointed out that imports remain strong due to
robust domestic demand and this will serve to hold the gap down.
   They traced the November surplus growth partly to a drop in oil
imports, due to lower imports volume and declining oil prices.
   Exports rose 18.8 percent to $22.2 billion from $18.6 billion a
year earlier, while overall imports surged 22.2 percent to $14.6
billion from $12 billion in the year-earlier month.
   Officials attributed the strong import growth to domestic demand
for such products as textiles and nonferrous metals needed to fuel
the growing Japanese economy.
   The so-called invisible account _ which includes transactions in
shipping, tourism, banking, insurance and commodities _ had a $560
million deficit, down from a $116 million year-earlier surplus.
   The deficit partly reflects the increasing number of Japanese
traveling overseas because of the strong yen.
   The six-month current-account report also indicated that during
the period Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 13.9
percent to $23.6 billion from $27.4 billion a year earlier.
   Exports to the United States rose 4.9 percent to $41 billion,
while imports jumped 49.2 percent to $17.4 billion.
   Japan's overall first-half current-account surplus fell 15.5
percent, to $37 billion from $43.7 billion. The trade surplus fell
10.3 percent to $43.5 billion.

   Wheat futures prices closed slightly lower Tuesday
in thin trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting a ``buy
the rumor, sell the fact'' attitude toward increased grain trade
with the Soviet Union.
   Oat futures rose sharply, boosted by strong spot markets, while
corn and soybean futures finished little changed.
   The Agriculture Department announced after Friday's close that it
had agreed to let the Soviets buy up to 16 million metric tons _
instead of the previously agreed-upon 12 million _ during the crop
year that began Oct. 1.
   The USDA also announced sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat
and 750,000 metric tons of corn to the Soviet Union.
   But traders had already bid prices of corn and wheat futures up
substantially in anticipation of the new business.
   ``I think the market's approaching everything conservatively _
they're not so certain how much of this (news) has already been
discounted,'' said Arthur Parrish, a grain market analyst with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.37\ a bushel; corn was 1} cents
lower to 1\ cents higher with March at $2.85 a bushel; oats were 4}
cents to 6 cents higher with March at $2.42} a bushel; soybeans were
1 cent lower to 5{ cents higher with January at $7.95} a bushel.

   Public Service Co. of New Hampshire on
Tuesday filed a bankruptcy reorganization plan that would leave it
federally regulated and able to charge ratepayers for its Seabrook
nuclear plant whether or not the reactor ever operates.
   The company said it will seek rate increases of 30 percent to 40
percent over three to five years.
   Nine months after it became the first major investor-owned
utility to seek protection from creditors since the Depression, New
Hampshire's largest utility disclosed a plan to escape state
regulation. Governor-elect Judd Gregg and other state officials
vowed to oppose the move.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Yacos had said that if Public Service
met Tuesday's deadline for filing a reorganization proposal, he
would bar competing plans for another two months while the utility
keeps trying to reach an agreement with creditors and other parties
in the case.
   ``The negotiation process does not end with the filing of this
plan,'' said Charles Bayless, senior vice president and chief
financial officer. ``We feel it is just the beginning of another
stage of negotiations.
   ``What we are filing today is our opening position with the
parties. I can tell you none of them agrees with it,'' Bayless said.
   ``The economy can certainly accept that kind of rate increase.
The question is whether the politicians can accept it,'' he said,
referring to the proposed rate hikes of 30 percent to 40 percent
over three to five years.
   An agreement with creditors would shorten greatly what could be a
protracted bankruptcy case. But previous talks between the state and
the utility were fruitless. So was a seven-hour session involving
all parties, called by Gov. John Sununu on Dec. 17.
   Public Service says it seeks a reorganization plan that is fair
to all parties. State officials fear that the utility is trying to
satisfy its creditors' demands at the expense of ratepayers.
   Under federal regulation, the utility likely would be able to
start charging its 360,000 ratepayers for its 36 percent share in
the $5.7 billion Seabrook nuclear power plant before it operates or
if it is cancelled. State law bars such charges.
   On paper, Seabrook represents two-thirds of Public Service's
assets, and except for Seabrook the utility is thriving. The reactor
was completed in July 1986 but its fate _ and therefore its value _
remains unclear, potentially complicating the utility's
reorganization.
   Public Service has said it believes it may be entitled to
increases of up to 40 percent under federal regulation. Shareholders
reportedly demanded 40 percent over two years. The state reportedly
offered at least 4 percent a year for five years.
   Four New England utilities have expressed interest in taking over
some or all of Public Service's assets other than Seabrook.
   At least one bondholders' group also offered a reorganization
plan for Public Service, though that was before the company sought
bankruptcy protection. Holders of some key third-mortgage bonds
proposed spinning Seabrook off into a separate company.

   Stocks weakened late today in an extremely light
post-Christmas session that brokers called a symptom of the sickly
trading volumes and underlying pessimism suffered by the market
through much of the year.
   Most large-scale institutional investors weren't participating
and those that were limited their transactions to end-of-year
portfolio adjustments and a few speculative takeover situations.
   ``The only thing I can say is the institutions are just sitting
back. They're happy they're going to get out of the year without any
disastrous crashes like we had last year,'' said Philip C. Puccio,
senior vice president and manager of institutional trading at Dillon
Read & Co. in New York. ``It's very tough to get the institutions to
do anything in the few sessions left.''

   Major retailers across the country went into the
Christmas season with lowered sales expectations, but many emerged
from it pleasantly surprised as consumers staged a buying burst.
   ``It was a good Christmas, a little bit better than what we had
planned,'' said Dayton Hudson Corp. spokesman Don St. Dennis.
   Wall Street analysts estimated overall retail sales were up
around 6 percent from Christmas 1987, with some segments of the
industry recording even stronger gains.
   Edward Johnson, an analyst with Prescott Ball & Turben, estimated
that department stores, general merchandisers and discount chains
enjoyed a 25 percent to 30 percent increase.
   At the start of the season, Johnson estimated industry-wide sales
would rise about 5 percent to 6 percent, but the strong showing
prompted him to revise that figure to 6 percent to 7 percent.
   ``It's in the high range of what the stores have been looking
for,'' he said of the industry's performance.
   The Christmas season is crucial for retailers because they make
about half their annual profits during the period. Consumer activity
such as retail sales accounts for about two-thirds of the gross
national product, the broadest measure of economic activity.
   Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.,
said the general tone of business was better than last year, when
faltering sales forced retailers to slash their prices.
   But this season there were fewer markdowns, Greenstein said.
   At Dayton Hudson's department stores, there were just three
promotional events, the industry term for markdowns. That compared
with 10 last year, St. Dennis said.
   The department stores turned in a surprisingly strong
performance, he said.
   Some retailers said they came through the season well, even
though business was erratic.
   ``I don't think we expected it to be quite as see-saw as it
was,'' said Michael Wellman, vice president for marketing at K mart
Corp.
   Wellman said K mart had a robust start right after Thanksgiving,
but the retailer saw sales slacken and then pick up before surging
in the final days of the season.
   ``They came through again,'' he said of last-minute shoppers.
   Wellman estimated K mart's discount stores had a 6 percent sales
increase, what the company had hoped to achieve when the season
began. There were no runaway bestselling items, but ``it was a
pretty solid kind of sales performance,'' Wellman said.
   Another satisfied retailer was Tiffany & Co., the luxury jeweler,
which reported its sales were up 24 percent from Nov. 1 through
Christmas Day. The company's performance indicated high-ticket gifts
sold well.
   The retailers and analysts had conservative expectations going
into the season because of a nearly 2-year-old retail sales slump.
Debt-saddled consumers have put many retail purchases on hold as
they pay for services and necessities.
   There were signs in recent months that sales might pick up, but
retailers were taking no chances. They stocked their shelves
carefully and didn't expect too much from the season.
   Retailers therefore have less merchandise to unload in the days
after Christmas.
   ``The stock rooms are clean _ there won't be a lot of big
clearance sales,'' Dayton Hudson's St. Dennis said.
   Some analysts said the holiday results might mean an end to that
the retailers' long dry spell is approaching.
   ``Christmas is really setting a positive tone for 1989,'' said
Robert Buchanan, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ``The consumer has been on his backside but is coming back.''
   ``Underlying strength in the consumer is beginning to build,''
Buchanan said. ``I'm looking for a respectable 1989 in terms of
non-durable sales.''
   But Greenstein, of Bear Stearns, was less optimistic. He said
clothing sales likely would be strong, but for the retail industry
as a whole, ``the rates of sales gains in recent months are not
sustainable.''

   An American Bar Association study panel on
Tuesday recommended federal regulation of the insurance industry.
   The 12-member ABA commission called for repeal of the 43-year-old
McCarran-Ferguson Act, in which Congress generally left insurance
regulation to the states.
   The commission, in a 183-page report, also urged that an agency
with subpoena powers investigate whether improper industry collusion
manipulates insurance availability and cost.
   The commission concluded that some collusion among insurers is
permitted under federal law, and said it was unable to assess
whether improper collusion has occurred.
   The commission's report will be presented to the ABA's
policy-making House of Delegates when it convenes in Denver in
February. The ABA is the nation's largest organization of lawyers.
   George Klotzbaugh, an American Insurance Association attorney,
termed the report's call for repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act
``misguided.''
   ``The report professes to support continued regulation by the
states but the changes it recommends ... would dictate to the states
how they have to regulate,'' he said. Klotzbaugh added that federal
antitrust law would become the chief regulatory tool.
   Trial lawyers and the insurance industry have been fighting for
years over who is to blame for the skyrocketing costs of liability
insurance.
   In recent years, numerous states have sued insurers and other
defendants, accusing them of illegally conspiring to limit the
availability of commercial liability insurance.

   The Israeli shekel was devalued 5 percent
Tuesday to stem a speculative buying binge of foreign currencies.
Analysts said it indicated the new government will move quickly to
deal with the foundering economy.
   The Bank of Israel announced the devaluation after consultations
with Finance Minister Shimon Peres. Peres, the former foreign
minister, moved into the finance post when the new government was
installed Thursday.
   The new exchange rate is 1.680 shekels to the dollar, compared
with 1.599 before the devaluation, the central bank said.
   The move prompted the stock exchange in Tel Aviv to close an hour
early ``to allow time for adjustment,'' said Yossi Nitzani, the
general director. He said the market would open on schedule
Wednesday.
   The devaluation was the first since a 10 percent adjustment in
January 1987 and was less than industry and commerce leaders had
lobbied for. That led some analysts to predict further devaluations.
   Factory production has been declining for a year, and economists
say the main reason is that profits have been squeezed by rising
production costs and a fixed exchange rate for earnings abroad.
   Israel's economy is expected to grow only 1 percent this year, a
sharp drop from 5.2 percent growth in 1987.
   Most of the weakness has been blamed on an industrial slowdown
and on the effects of the year-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories.
   The government apparently was forced to move Tuesday because of
soaring currency speculation sparked by rumors of an imminent
devaluation of as much as 15 percent.
   ``What happened this morning was extraordinary,'' Bank of Israel
chief Michael Bruno said on Israel radio. ``There was a real danger
that in several days monetary reserves would drop below the $3
billion mark.''
   Gideon Schurr, spokesman for the Bank of Israel, said purchases
in foreign currency were ``particularly high'' Tuesday, but he
refused to give exact figures.
   Israeli army radio said Israelis purchased a record $80 million
in U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies before the devaluation
was announced.
   The public apparently hoped to make a profit by buying foreign
currency at a lower shekel rate and selling after devaluation at a
higher rate.
   Analysts said it was too early to tell if the devaluation will
stem the speculation.
   Yacov Sheinin, manager of the Economic Models Ltd. forecasting
firm in Tel Aviv, suggested there might be another 5 percent
devaluation early in January and a similar devaluation later in the
month, ``making it less profitable to go to dollars and then shift
back to shekels'' because of bank service charges averaging 3
percent on the transactions.
   But Sheinin said devaluation could spark inflation and might not
help the economy unless coupled with budget cuts and an agreement to
hold down wages.
   The government is expected to show a deficit of more than 1
billion shekels, or $600 million, this year, largely because of
increased defense spending to handle the Palestinian uprising.
   The devaluation drew criticism from the right-wing Likud bloc and
from some in Peres' Labor Party.
   Peres' predecessor in the finance ministry, Moshe Nissim of
Likud, said he resisted pressure to devaluate ``because I was not
prepared to listen to the dictate of the street.''
   Chaim Ramon, a Labor member of parliament, termed the action ``a
worthless step'' and said it would have been better to wait and come
out with a general economic program.
   But Peres' economic adviser, Amnon Neubach, said the move was
necessary to calm the public and the markets.

   Stocks retreated Tuesday in the third-lightest
trading session of the year, reflecting what brokers called the kind
of apathy and pessimism that has afflicted the market through much
of 1988.
   The Dow Jones industrial average barely budged through
midafternoon but weakened late in the session and closed 6.25 points
lower to 2,162.68. Broader market indicators also declined.
   Most big institutional investors weren't participating and those
that were largely limited their transactions to end-of-year
portfolio adjustments and a few speculative takeover situations,
strategists said.
   Others attributed the stock market's weakness to a price drop in
the bond market, which sent yields higher and made bonds a more
attractive investment.
   ``The only thing I can say is the institutions are just sitting
back. They're happy they're going to get out of the year without any
disastrous crashes like we had last year,'' said Philip C. Puccio,
senior vice president and manager of institutional trading at Dillon
Read & Co. in New York. ``It's very tough to get the institutions to
do anything in the few sessions left.''
   Robert O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., said business was more active in the smaller
stocks than on the New York Stock Exchange, but he expected the
overall market to slow to a crawl as the New Year's holiday
approached.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 87.49 million shares,
only slightly better than the second-lowest level of 81.76 million
in the previous session Friday. The market was closed Monday for the
three-day Christmas holiday.
   The lowest trading volume of the year was Friday Nov. 25, the day
after Thanksgiving, when 72.09 million shares changed hands.
   Losing issues outnumbered advances by more than a 7-to-5 ratio in
composite NYSE trades, with 800 down, 554 up and 599 unchanged.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 107.89 million shares.
   The most prominent NYSE issue was Paradyne, which jumped 4} to 10
on volume exceeding 3 million shares after American Telephone &
Telegraph said it would acquire the company for $10.25 a share or
about $250 million.
   Another notable takeover-related stock was American Brands, which
rose 1} to 69{ after having surged 10[ on Friday because of rumors
the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever would attempt to acquire the
company.
   Despite reports that retailers benefited from a surprising late
surge in Christmas business, retailing stocks showed little reaction
or retreated. K mart fell \ to 34~, Sears fell \ to 41{ and J.C.
Penney fell | to 52\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $8.36 billion, or 0.31
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.48 to 155.58.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.10 to 320.18, and S&P's
500-stock composite index fell 1.04 to 276.83.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.70 to 376.64. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell 0.78 to 301.44.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Drop As Supply Outlook Brightens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices fell sharply Tuesday in thin trading on New
York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, reflecting an improved
outlook for supplies of green unroasted coffee beans from Brazil,
the world's largest producer.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans were mixed; energy futures
rose, precious metals gained; livestock futures advanced while pork
bellies declined; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Coffee settled 3.1 cents to 3.9 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in March at $1.4627 a pound.
   The near-term supply scenario for Brazilian coffee brightened
considerably late last week when dockworkers in the South American
nation agreed to end a 10-day strike.
   News of the settlement barely stirred the U.S. coffee futures
market last Friday morning but some analysts called Tuesday's steep
sell-off a delayed reaction. The Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and
most other U.S. futures exchanges closed at midday on Friday for the
Christmas holiday weekend and did not reopen until Tuesday morning.
   Other observers said weekend rainfall in parts of the Brazilian
coffee zone was a stronger fundamental factor in Tuesday's trading.
Drought conditions in Brazil's coffee country have contributed
heavily to a recent sharp rise in green coffee futures prices, which
hit a 2-year high of $1.59 a pound last week.
   The reports of rain in Brazil ``obviously weakened the market,''
said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   But analyst Judith Ganes of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York predicted some traders would see the lower prices as buying
opportunities.
   ``Good support should materialize with further price weakness,''
she said. ``There still are underlying concerns about the Brazilian
coffee crop due to drought damage.''
   Both analysts also pointed out that London's coffee exchange was
closed Tuesday, reducing the number of players in a market already
thinned by holiday absences.
   Wheat futures prices closed slightly lower on the Chicago Board
of Trade, reflecting a ``buy the rumor, sell the fact'' attitude
toward increased grain trade with the Soviet Union.
   Oat futures rose sharply, boosted by strong spot markets, while
corn and soybean futures finished little changed.
   The Agriculture Department announced after Friday's close that it
had agreed to let the Soviets buy up to 16 million metric tons _
instead of the previously agreed-upon 12 million _ during the crop
year that began Oct. 1.
   The USDA also announced sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat
and 750,000 metric tons of corn to the Soviet Union.
   But traders had already bid prices of corn and wheat futures up
substantially in anticipation of the new business, and some sold
contracts Tuesday in reaction to the news, analysts said.
   Weekend rainfall in the Brazilian soybean belt accounted for some
of the selling in the soybean pit, said Joel Karlin, research
analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   After Tuesday's close, the USDA announced the Soviet Union had
purchased 250,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with March at $4.37\ a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with March at
$2.85\ a bushel; oats were 4{ cents to 5} cents higher with March at
$2.42} a bushel; soybeans were } cent lower to 6{ cents higher with
January at $7.96{ a bushel.
   Energy futures prices rose moderately on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on news of a weekend mishap that shut down three North Sea
oil fields, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 34 cents
higher with February at $16.95 a barrel; heating oil was .63 cent to
.87 cent higher with January at 53.77 cents a barrel; unleaded
gasoline was .53 cent to .69 cent higher with January at 47.47 cents
a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures prices declined slightly in thin,
lackluster trading on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 50 cents to 70 cents lower with February at $420.90
a troy ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.3 cents lower with March at
$6.255 a troy ounce.
   Cattle and hog futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, buoyed by strong spot markets, while frozen
pork bellies declined in late profit-taking, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .27 cent higher with
February at 74.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .45 cent higher with January at 84.17 cents a pound; live hogs
were .02 cent to .43 cent higher with February at 47.32 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent to .48 cent lower with
February at 44.10 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .70 point lower at 280. Each point is worth
$500.

   Chrysler Motors announced Tuesday
that Eagle Premier prices will increase by up to $600 effective with
shipments of Jan. 2.
   The price hike stems from fluctuating exchange rates between the
French franc and the dollar, which has dropped in value against the
French currency by about 7 percent in the past four months, said
company spokeswoman Karen Stewart.
   Some components in the models are produced in France, she said.
   The Eagle Premier LX price will increase $300 to $13,276, and the
Eagle Premier ES will jump $600 to $15,859, Chrysler said in a

   The dollar closed mostly higher on domestic
markets after ending mixed overseas Tuesday as foreign exchange
activity settled into a year-end lull.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
reported a bid of $417.50 a troy ounce for gold as of 4 p.m. EST,
down from late Friday's $418.25.
   Currency trading was extremely quiet.
   ``It's the week between Christmas and New Year's, London is
closed and there's no news,'' said Richard Witten, vice president
for foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs & Co.
   ``There's virtually no flow of transactions back and forth,''
Witten said, adding, ``It's a paperwork day.''
   All financial markets in London were closed for Boxing Day, the
post-Christmas holiday. Dealers said most trading rooms in other
European countries were lightly staffed Tuesday, with many traders
on vacation through New Year's.
   ``One can't even call it a market,'' said one foreign currency
dealer at a West German bank.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to remain near its present
levels until the end of the year.
   The dollar began its day in Tokyo, rising 0.08 yen from Monday's
close to close at 124.80. Later in Europe, the dollar was quoted at
the same rate, and in New York the dollar rose to 124.935 yen from
late Friday's 124.80.
   The British pound rose to $1.8030 in Europe, compared with
$1.80125 in London on Friday. In later New York trading, sterling
edged up to $1.8023 from late Friday's $1.8020.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's
prices, included: 1.7775 West German marks, up from 1.7755; 1.4990
Swiss francs, up from 1.4985; 6.07125 French francs, up from 6.0640;
1,309.25 Italian lire, up from 1,307.50; and 1.9725 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.19625.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates in
London on Friday, included: 1.7760 West German marks, unchanged;
1.49875 Swiss francs, up from 1.4980; 6.0675 French francs, down
from 6.0690; 2.0050 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0060; 1,308.10
Italian lire, down from 1,309.80; 1.19575 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.19625.
   Bullion dealers in Zurich said gold rose in quiet and thin
trading, with many dealers still on holiday. Bullion markets were
closed in Hong Kong.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a late bid of $418.50 a troy ounce, up
from $416.30 bid late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
was unchanged at $418 a troy ounce.
   Silver finished in Zurich at a late bid of $6.16 a troy ounce, up
from a late bid in London on Friday of $6.12. On New York's Comex,
silver closed at $6.180 a troy ounce, up from $6.135 on Friday.

   For a jetliner old is not necessarily unsafe,
but a number of recent structural failures involving aging aircraft
is prompting federal officials and the industry to re-examine the
question: When is an airplane too old to fly?
   The effect of aging aircraft on safety gained widespread
attention eight months ago when a third of the roof of a 19-year-old
Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 tore away during flight, sweeping a flight
attendant to her death.
   Industry experts from Boeing engineers and airline maintenance
officials to government regulators and aviation crash investigators
were stunned that such a large section _ 20 feet long along the top
of the plane _ would peel away. The plane's safe landing was
described as miraculous.
   The issue surfaced again in the investigation of the crash of Pan
Am Flight 103 last week in Scotland. A massive structural failure on
the vintage Boeing 747 _ the 15th off the assembly line in l970 _
has not yet been ruled out.
   And on Monday, a 14-inch hole tore open along the crown of a
20-year-old Boeing 727 belonging to Eastern Airlines, forcing the
plane to make an emergency descent from 31,000 feet and land at
Charleston, W.Va. No one was seriously injured.
   The aviation industry and government regulators have acknoweldged
for years that the airlines' jet fleet is growing older and that
added precautions are needed to monitor cracks and other problems
that develop on these jets.
   In the case of the Pan Am jumbo jet, Pan Am spokesman Jeffrey
Kriendler emphasized that the Boeing 747, although 18 years old, had
undergone extensive modifications and strengthening as recently as
mid-l987. As a result, he said ``the airplane comes out almost brand
new.''
   Investigators also emphasized that they have found no evidence so
far of a fatigue-related structural failure related to the crash.
One possible cause continues to be a terrorist bomb.
   But Pan Am and many other airlines indeed are flying older
aircraft than once had been expected. With fuel prices declining,
airlines have held on to older jets. Eastern not long ago, for
example, decided to overhaul its older Boeing 727s, instead of
replace them.
   Since l979, the average age of the aircraft fleet belonging to
the major airlines has increased from 10.28 years to 12.53 years,
according to Avmark Inc., an aircraft consulting and appraisal firm.
It is estimated that there are about 2,300 jetliners in service that
were built before l968.
   Ben Cosgrove, vice president for engineering at the Boeing
Commercial Airplane Co., emphasized in a recent interview that age
in itself is not necessarily unsafe. But he said as an aircraft gets
older it must come under closer inspections and increased
maintenance.
   As a plane ages ``you should start to expect to see some more
damage occur ... through fatigue and corrosion,'' he says.
   In l983, the FAA and industry began a program aimed at developing
new safeguards to keep aging jetliners airworthy. Under the program
about 1,000 older jets _ Boeing 727s, 737s, 747s, McDonnell Douglas
DC-9s and DC-8s _ are subject to special inspections because such
jets are more likely to develop cracks and other problems.
   But critics question whether closer monitoring and more frequent
inspections are an adequate safeguard. And since the Aloha incident
in April many industry experts _ including Boeing engineers and FAA
safety experts _ have agreed that inspections alone may not be
enough.
   ``In some cases modification (of the aircraft) is needed, not
just (added) inspection,'' said Cosgrove, acknowledging that this
view represents a change in industry thinking.
   In October, the FAA directed the replacement of 7,200 rivets on
every older Boeing 737 to guard against a repeat of the Aloha
accident. A string of previous FAA orders following the Aloha
incident focused only on requiring closer inspections.
   The far-reaching and costly October directive is seen by industry
experts to reflect a new attitude that close inspections are not
enough to keep older aircraft safe and that in many cases sections
of planes must be routinely replaced even if no defect is apparent.
   Three weeks before the directive was issued, workers at
Continental Airlines, during a routine repainting, discovered a
foot-long crack on an aging Continental Boeing 737. The crack
apparently had not been noticed before, even though that aircraft
had been among those subject to special scrutiny because of its age.
   Nearly three years ago, Jim Burnett, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, cautioned in congressional testimony
that the FAA may be incapable of ensuring that older aircraft are
kept free of dangerous cracks.
   That is said to still be his view as the NTSB begins an
investigation of Monday's incident involving the Eastern flight and
as it nears conclusion of a nearly yearlong investigation of the
Aloha accident.

   LTV Corp.'s committee of unsecured creditors,

   One of the newly formed groups will handle LTV's steel company
creditors and the other will take care of the parent company's
creditors.
   James F. Powers, LTV's chief financial officer, said the
separation can help facilitate the company's emergence from Chapter

<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. announced modest
increases in the wholesale prices of its color televisions Tuesday,
saying the higher price tags reflected ``a new opportunity for
improved profitability.''
   The increases, effective next Monday, will average 1 percent to 2
percent, Zenith said in a statement. The price action, if passed
through to consumers, would raise the price of a $300 TV set by $3
to $6, Zenith spokesman John I. Taylor said.
   Zenith said it also was raising prices on its video cassette
recorders.
   Manufacturers ordinarily raise prices with apologies to
consumers, citing external factors that have forced them to charge
more.
   But officials of Zenith, the last major U.S. television maker,
hope an industry-wide round of price increases will bring to an end
the price-cutting and financial losses the company has suffered in
its battle against low-priced imports.
   ``For the first time in many years, there appear to be real
opportunities for price increases to stick,'' Gerald M. McCarthy,
president of the Zenith Sales Co. division, said in a statement.
   ``Most major manufacturers now acknowledge what we've been saying
for years: that the price erosion that has continually plagued our
industry must stop,'' McCarthy said.
   He said other television manufacturers also have announced
increases and predicted further price rises during 1989. But
McCarthy said Zenith's Jan. 1 mark-ups were ``realistic in terms of
conditioning the wholesale and retail environment to upward price
movement.''
   McCarthy said worldwide picture-tube shortages and the dollar's
decline against the Korean won _ making Korean-made TVs more
expensive here _ suggested that TV prices would not continue to
decline.
   Glenview-based Zenith, which also makes personal computers, has
not reported an annual profit since 1984 due to multimillion-dollar
losses in its consumer electronics division.
   ``It's been a period of profitless prosperity,'' Taylor said.
``Over the years, as the industry has continued to grow and thrive
in terms of record shipments of unit television sets and
advancements in technology, prices in the marketplace have continued
to decline, making it difficult for not only Zenith but others to
make a profit in this business.''
   In October, at the same time it was waging an ultimately
successful battle against a takeover-minded shareholder group,
Zenith said internal cost-cutting had enabled it to reduce its TV
prices to competitive levels.
   Zenith Chairman Jerry Pearlman said last week the company planned
to ask the government to monitor imports of televisions from
countries suspected of ``dumping'' the sets in the United States at
unfairly low prices.

<HEAD>U.S. Division of Grand Met to Move from New Jersey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTVALE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives and employees of Grand Met USA,
the U.S. subsidiary of the British company that recently acquired
Pillsbury Co., will move to Minnesota to be closer to the
conglomerate's new acquisition, a Grand Met spokesman said Tuesday.
   Grand Met USA Chairman Ian A. Martin and his staff will be among
the transplanted employees moving in the next several months, said
spokesman Walter Montgomery.
   ``What that leaves in Montvale, I don't know. I'm not sure
they've determined exactly what it means in terms of people in
Minneapolis vis-a-vis Montvale,'' he said.
   The Montvale-based company is a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan
PLC, the British distilling and retailing giant that acquired
Minneapolis-based Pillsbury last week in a $5.7 billion deal after
nearly three months of negotiations and court hearings.
   ``Pillsbury is a very, very large operation,'' Montgomery said.
``It will be the single biggest part of the international food
operations of Grand Met. It's a substantial addition to Grand Met.''
   Pillsbury spokesman Larry Haeg said he had no information on the
relocation plans.
   Martin, 53, is also Grand Met USA's chief executive officer.
Montgomery said Martin is expected to move with his staff sometime
in January or February, after the Pillsbury deal is completed.
   The spokesman did not say how many of the 60 workers at the
Montvale headquarters or how much of the company's other East Coast
operations would be relocated.
   Pillsbury Chairman Philip L. Smith is scheduled to leave the
company after the ownership change.
   Grand Met, which employs more than 130,000 workers worldwide, has
several operations on the East Coast _ including Carillon Importers
Ltd. in Teaneck, N.J., Paddington Corp. in Fort Lee, N.J., and
Heublein Inc. in Farmington, Conn., all liquor-related businesses,
and Alpo Pet Foods Inc. in Allentown, Pa.
   Pillsbury's restaurant and food operations _ which include Burger
King and product lines such as Green Giant vegetables, Bumble Bee
tuna and Geno's Pizza _ has 5,000 workers at its base in Minneapolis
and 100,000 employees worldwide.
   Pillsbury shareholders have until Jan. 3 to tender their stock to
Grand Met, which will pay $66 a share, $6 more than its initial
offer.

   Sunshine Mining Co. will buy Rexene Corp., a
plastics and petrochemical maker, for $865.2 million, officials for
the companies said Tuesday.
   Officials for the Dallas-based firms said they plan to sign a
letter of intent for Sunshine, known primarily for silver mining and
natural gas production, to pay $28 for each of Rexene's 30.9 million
shares of common stock in cash and securities.
   The deal is subject to shareholder approval.
   Rexene, through its subsidiary Rexene Products Co., makes
thermoplastic resins and petrochemical products. Its products are
used in many household goods, including food packaging, toys,
plastic lining used in diapers, and styrene used in disposable cups
and other containers.
   ``We decided about nine months ago that, strategically, we needed
to put a third leg on the stool, needed to get into a third line of
business,'' said G. Michael Boswell, Sunshine's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Sunshine officials said the match is a natural for both
companies. Joe Denahan, executive vice president and chief financial
officer for Sunshine, said that when oil and gas prices are low, so
are the prices for the raw materials used by Rexene.
   Sunshine lost more than $11 million during the quarter ending
Sept. 30, while Rexene made more than $35 million.
   Trading in Rexene's stock was halted early Tuesday pending the
announcement and resumed later in the morning.
   Rexene's stock fell $2.50 to $22 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Last week, Rexene announced that an unidentified public company
was interested in buying all outstanding shares. The company, which
went public in July, was the biggest gainer on the New York Stock
Exchange last week, rising 50 percent.
   ``Part of Sunshine's strategy has been to acquire a third line of
business related to natural resources but (not) to oil and gas and
precious metals,'' Boswell said.
   ``Sunshine's acquisition of Rexene fits this criteria, as the
bulk of Rexene's raw materials are derivatives of natural gas
liquids . . . ,'' he said.
   Boswell said Sunshine plans no layoffs and will run the new
business using the current management.
   Rexene's primary production plants are both in Texas, in Odessa
and near Houston.
   ``We hope to reach a definitive agreement quickly and look
forward to working with Sunshine,'' said Rexene's chairman and chief
executive officer, Andrew J. Smith.

   The harrowing forced landing of an Eastern Airlines
jetliner came as the financially pressed carrier was struggling to
keep safety questions behind it while dealing with a tense labor
situation.
   ``We know that Eastern Airlines is safe. We hope that
professionalism will prevail,'' Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak
said Tuesday.
   The money-losing airline, whose executives have expressed concern
about the financial impact of public perceptions of its labor
relations, could face new safety questions after Monday's emergency
landing of an Atlanta-bound Boeing 727 in Charleston, W.Va. A
14-inch hole tore open in its fuselage, depressurizing the cabin.
   The same plane had made seven earlier unscheduled landings in the
last five years, said Federal Aviation Administration officials,
although they indicated that such a record wasn't unusual for a
commercial jetliner.
   Mechanics at Eastern spent Tuesday inspecting 17 of the 100
series 727s and 28 of the 200 series 727s, Ceremsak said.
   ``We're doing it on our own,'' she said. ``It's just as a
precautionary measure following yesterday's incident.''
   On Sunday, an Eastern A300 bound for Newark, N.J., had to return
to Miami International Airport because of an engine problem; and on
Tuesday, a Fort Lauderdale-bound A300 turned back to New York's
LaGuardia airport after a problem with a door prevented the plane
from being properly pressurized.
   Eastern officials insist their safety record is one of the
industry's best, and blame scrutiny of it on publicity ploys by
labor. The airline's unions complained this year that Eastern
employees were being pressured to bypass safety procedures.
   Less than a month ago, a management-labor agreement negotiated in
July by former Labor Secretary William Brock was undercut as
Eastern's pilots and Machinists unions curtailed their participation.
   Brock was enlisted by U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley
to mediate after an unprecedented two-pronged investigation of
Eastern's safety and its Texas Air Corp. ownership's ability to run
the Miami-based carrier.
   Those probes, which included FAA inspection of every Eastern
plane, reported the airline was safe, but expressed concern over
labor-management strife the report said could have ``an adverse
impact on the public safety.'' The Brock agreement called for a
master safety committee, regular meetings and other measures aimed
at keeping labor disputes from affecting safety.
   ``The unions had withdrawn from that,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.
``We're still committed to that program because we believe it's an
ideal forum to separate labor issues from safety. We felt the
suspension of their participation was motivated not by safety
concerns but by other side issues.''
   Ron Cole, a spokesman for Eastern pilots in the Air Line Pilots
Association, said communication continues with management on safety
concerns, but ALPA ``chose to pull out of the Brock accord and seek
redress of our grievances elsewhere.''
   On Dec. 7, the pilots union asked Burnley to reopen the
Transportation Department investigation into Eastern's management,
but Burnley rejected that request in a sharply worded response that
said Eastern has demonstrated the ability to operate safely and
there was no reason to probe it again.
   ``The only cause for concern with respect to safety issues has
been created by the irresponsible conduct of ALPA and the IAM
(International Association of Machinists) in withdrawing from the
safety committee process,'' Burnley added.
   Cole said Tuesday the pilots' national leadership has since
written again to Burnley.
   ``I think any time management engages in open warfare with its
employees, there is the potential for an unsafe airline,'' Cole
said. He said Eastern management followed the Brock agreement by
cutting some 12 percent of its flights and nearly 4,000 jobs, then
selling its Northeast shuttle service to New York developer Donald
Trump.
   ``We feel those moves were designed to put pressure on the labor
groups,'' Cole said.
   Brock was out of town Tuesday. He has written to the Eastern
unions urging them to rejoin the safety committees.
   Eastern Machinists President Charles E. Bryan was unavailable for
comment. He was preparing for intense federal mediation beginning
next week in his union's year-old contract stalemate.
   Eastern officials say the high costs of labor and the public
perception of Eastern as beset by labor problems are worsening its
financial condition. Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for
the first three quarters of this year and has lost $1.3 billion in
the past decade.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Rejects Centaur's Offer Of $100 Per Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pennwalt Corp. board of directors has
rejected Centaur Partners' buyout proposal of $100 a share, calling
the figure ``completely unacceptable.''
   The buyout offer by Centaur, whose principals are New York
financiers Abbey J. Butler and Melvyn J. Estrin, is worth about $765
million. Centaur already owns 12.7 percent of the chemical company's
outstanding shares.
   Pennwalt stock closed even at 104| Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   In a statement released Tuesday, Pennwalt listed several factors
for the board's decision, including the success of Pennwalt's
restructuring program and its future prospects. The board also
considered the ``large number of significant uncertainties'' in the
Centaur offer, the statement said.
   In addition, the board said, Centaur's business philosophy is
incompatible with Pennwalt's viewpoint.
   The statement did not go into detail but did include portions of
a letter to shareholders from Edwin E. Tuttle, Pennwalt's chairman
and chief executive officer.
   In the letter, Tuttle called Centaur's offer ``illusory,'' saying
the offer ``is not intended to succeed.''
   Tuttle, who is also Pennwalt's chief executive officer, said
Centaur only wants to realize a short-term profit.
   Tuttle urged Pennwalt's shareholders to reject Centaur's offer,
saying the shareholders deserve to ``reap the benefits'' of the
company's restructuring program.
   Pennwalt announced that it will file the board's recommendation
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Centaur filed its
official tender offer with the commission on Dec. 13.
   In the offer, Centaur said it might sell the company's
agrichemical operations if their takeover succeeds. Centaur also
said it would try to reduce overhead expenses, which could mean
layoffs. Pennwalt currently has 9,000 employees and annual sales of
more than $1 billion.
   Six months ago, Centaur announced it had bought a large stake in
Pennwalt and in October said it had acquired 1 million shares, or
8.6 percent of the company.
   Pennwalt has responded by selling its drug and equipment business
and buying back about 40 percent of the outstanding shares.
