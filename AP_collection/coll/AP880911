   A British frigate collided with a Canadian support
ship Sunday during NATO maneuvers off Norway, the Ministry of
Defense said.
   A ministry spokesman said there were no injuries in the
collision between the HMS Penelope and the Canadian vessel
Preserver. He said the Preserver was not damaged and would continue
to take part in the exercise.
   The Penelope headed for Rosyth on the Scottish east coast, where
the extent of the damage would be determined.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
collision took place during a refueling operation about 7 a.m. (1
a.m. EDT) Sunday in Vestfjorden, the waterway between the Lofoten
Islands and the northwest Norwegian coast.
   Penelope is a 3,200-ton Leander class warship with 230 officers
and crew. The much larger Preserver, 24,700 tons, has a complement
of 290 and is mainly used for refueling other ships at sea.
   The vessels were taking part in Teamwork '88, a NATO exercise
involving 45,000 land, sea and air personnel of the armed forces of
nine NATO countries, 340 aircraft and 200 ships. The exercise is
designed to test naval warfare, air force collaboration,
anti-submarine, carrier and convoy operations and amphibious
landings.
   The exercise began Aug. 31 and runs through Sept. 21.
   Sunday's collision was the second reported in nine days to a
British warship.
   The destroyer HMS Southampton was rammed and badly damaged Sept.
3 in the Gulf of Oman by the British container ship Tor Bay it was
protecting.
   Eleven sailors on the destroyer were injured, three having
broken bones, but no one was hurt on the much larger merchantman.

   Burundi President Pierre Buyoya has
visited the area in northern Burundi where at least 5,000 people
were killed last month in tribal violence, Radio Burundi reported
Sunday.
   The state-run radio said Buyoya, during his weekend tour,
commended doctors for helping the wounded in the districts of Ntega
and Marangara, the sites of the massacre of thousands of people of
the majority Hutu tribe in the warfare that began Aug. 14.
   An estimated 55,000 people fled into neighboring Rwanda to
escape the violence that claimed 5,000 lives, according to
government estimates. Other sources have said the death toll was
much higher.
   Radio Burundi, in a brief item monitored in Nairobi, said Buyoya
claimed the killings were caused by dissident Hutus who infiltrated
into the north to provoke attacks against the minority Tutsi tribe.
Buyoya's government had made the same allegation earlier.
   The Tutsis comprise only 15 percent of Burundi's population of 5
million but control the tiny central African nation's government
and army. About 84 percent of the population are Hutus.
   Some Burundi refugees in Rwanda have said Hutus initiated the
killings by attacking Tutsis in Ntega but soldiers were responsible
for most of the massacres that spread into Marangara. They said the
troops began killing Hutus in reprisal for the slain Tutsis.
   Burundi's government has acknowledged its military forces became
involved but claims soldiers killed fewer than a dozen people and
restored peace in the area by Aug. 17.
   The two tribes are longtime enemies. Following a Hutu-led coup
attempt in the former Belgium colony in 1972 the Tutsi massacred an
estimated 100,000 Hutus.

federal prisoners under a prison warden's plan.
   The federal Bureau of Prisons has approved the plan, Butler
County Warden Charles Fenton said recently.
   Fenton said he will have 45 days to open the center at the
four-story, 100-room former Sheraton Inn after he signs a federal

   Under Fenton's proposal, the halfway house would hold up to 50
non-violent prisoners. Butler County would be paid a fee for each
prisoner.

<TEXT>
   Snow dusted parts of
Yellowstone National Park on Sunday, giving firefighters a break in
their battle against forest fires, and people evacuated from park
headquarters and several towns returned home.
   Federal officials said they would double the number of soldiers
sent to battle the fires that have charred more than a third of the
2.2 million-acre park.
   After months of drought and heat, temperatures only reached the
mid-30s Sunday, with humidity as high as 90 percent. Some sections
of the park were dampened by light showers Saturday.
   ``The colder temperatures are going to raise the humidity and
with the higher humidity, the wood will absorb some of that
moisture. It'll be less likely to burn, although the fire shouldn't
have much trouble,'' said Joe Halliday, chief naturalist for the
west district of Yellowstone.
   Winds were expected to stay in a more manageable range of 15 to
30 mph, well below the gusts above 50 mph that had driven the
flames the previous two days.
   Fires have charred 883,000 acres of Yellowstone since June in
what firefighters call the worst fire season in the West in 30
years.
   About 80 Canadian air crew members hired to help drop fire
retardant arrived in Coeur D'alene, Idaho, for training.
   Light snow and low temperatures also helped firefighters in
Idaho, where wind gusted to 60 mph, and Montana, where evacuated
residents of some ranches and small communities were allowed to
return home.
   Rain and lower temperatures dampened fires in Colorado, but 45
mph wind gusts whipped a Boulder County fire to 1,830 acres and led
six families to evacuate. Heavy rains later Sunday stalled the fire
and residents were allowed to return home. Fires in the Routt
National Forest were left unattended because the weather was too
cold and wet for firefighters.
   And in northwest Oregon, the state Department of Forestry shut
down millions of acres of state-protected forests in an
unprecedented effort to curb the number of fires caused by human
carelessness.
   ``Given the number of human-caused fires we're seeing every day,
this is the most viable option we have right now,'' said forestry
department spokesman Doug Decker.
   Altogether, 13.3 million acres, or 83 percent of the state's
forests, have been closed, Decker said.
   A fire also burned in northern California, where a mountain
blaze whipped by hot winds burned 2,000 acres of brush and timber
near the town of Grass Valley.
   There were no reports of injuries, but authorities described the
blaze as a wall of fire a half-mile long that was headed toward
affluent Lake Wildwood, a residential area of about 2,000 homes.
   And in Washington, a rapidly expanding fire started by an
illegal campfire spread rapidly to more than 300 acres in Olympic
National Park high country Sunday.
   Thin smoke from the Yellowstone fires has drifted as far east as
Pennsylvania and New York at an altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet,
the National Weather Service said Sunday.
   ``A couple days ago most of the smoke was over the Midwest and
it has now gradually drifted eastward,'' said Brian Smith of the
Severe Storms Center in Kansas City, Mo. ``It's just going to have
a thin hazy appearance and might create some colorful sunsets, but
it's not expected to present any health problems because it's so
far up.''
   The 263,400-acre North Fork fire in Yellowstone remained about a
mile from park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs, said
spokeswoman Marty Tobias. That fire also has threatened West
Yellowstone, Mont., and destroyed several buildings at Old Faithful
geyser.
   Park officials Saturday ordered all families and nonessential
employees to leave Mammoth, near the park's north entrance. But
they were allowed back after conditions improved. Tobias did not
know how many people decided to return.
   The improved weather allowed park officials to reopen
Yellowstone's west entrance and the road from there to Madison
Junction and Old Faithful. The rest of the park remained closed to
visitors.
   Ten miles northeast of Mammoth, residents of Jardine, Mont.,
also were allowed to return, Tobias added. They were evacuated
Saturday when fire threatened the only exit road.
   Evacuated residents of Cooke City and Silver Gate, Mont., at the
northeast gate to Yellowstone, were allowed to return home Sunday
and the highway leading into the area was reopened, said fire
information officer Nick Tafoya.
   A mile from Yellowstone's headquarters, firefighters sprayed
protective foam Sunday on buildings at the Young Adult Conservation
Corps camp, where fire destroyed a tent.
   ``Basically with this cold front that's moved in it's going to
put us kind of in a holding pattern. We'll see how it goes from
there,'' Tobias said. ``Let's just drop this wind and we'll be in
business.''
   However, Brian Morris, a Forest Service spokesman in West
Yellowstone, said: ``It's not going to be with us too long. We
expect warmer weather and a drying trend this week.''
   About 9,000 people are fighting the fires in Yellowstone. Deputy
Defense Secretary William Taft IV said 1,200 Marines from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., and two Army battalions will join the 2,300 Army
soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., fighting the fires.
   ``So by the end of next week, we will see a doubled
representation by the military in this effort,'' Taft said.

   The struggle for civil rights remains
alive, although it has changed, says one of several activists
honored for their work in the 1960s.
   ``The nature and the character of the movement has changed, but
these changes are merely part of a natural process and do not spell
doom for our hopes,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., former chairman
of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
   Lewis, who received an honorary doctorate at a convocation
Saturday opening Williams College's 196th academic year, said the
American people must elect leaders with the ``moral capacity'' of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. if civil rights are to improve with
time.
   ``We have lost some of our finest leaders, but we are still very
involved in that same movement for liberation,'' said Lewis, who
was jailed 40 times and severely beaten during the Sixties for
leading peaceful marches and demonstrations throughout the South.
``Our struggle is not for one day, or one week, or one year, but
for a lifetime if that's what it takes.''
   Among thos honored Saturday was Rosa L. Parks, whose refusal to
surrender her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Ala. bus
sparked a boycott that was a milestone in the civil rights
movement. She received a standing ovation from the audience of
1,000 students, faculty members and administrators.
   Also honored were the Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, former president
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and journalist
Charlayne Hunter-Gault, the first black woman at the University of
Georgia.

   A record 916 people tackled Mount
McKinley during the mountaineering season, says the National Park
Service, which is thinking about putting another outhouse on North
America's tallest mountain.
   Sanitation on the 20,320-foot mountain has been a growing
concern, said Ranger Roger Robinson.
   According to Robinson, 562 of the 916 people who registered to
climb McKinley this spring and summer reported reaching the summit.
   Last year, 817 climbers tested themselves against the mountain.
Only about a third finished the climb.
   Two people died climbing McKinley this year, Robinson said.
   Don Henry, a 71-year-old Connecticut lawyer, this year became
the oldest person known to have made the top.
   Robinson attributed some of the increased mountaineering to
foreigners who decided attractive currency exchange rates made this
the year for the climb they had long wanted to make.
   Climbers began arriving in April and some waited until late
July, but most planned their trips for May and June.
   ``We're trying to get more people to come in July,'' Robinson
said. Rangers attempting to deal with the environmental effects of
increased activity want use of the mountain to be spread out.
   The Park Service asks climbers to use plastic bags for human
waste and put the bags in crevasses, but officials don't know how
many comply, Robinson said. There are two latrines on McKinley, one
two-thirds of the way up the peak. The Park Service hopes to
install an outhouse at 17,000 feet next year.

<HEAD>Pope's Visit To Marxist Mozambique Comes Amid Controversy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note pope visits Sept. 16-19.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II's customary message
of peace and reconciliation could be a controversial one when he
visits Mozambique, a southern African nation wracked by 12 years of
civil war, drought and systematic destruction of public facilities.
   A newsletter issued last year by Frelimo, the governing Marxist
party, called the former Portuguese colony's Roman Catholic bishops
``enemies of the people'' after they suggested the government meet
with guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance.
   But Cardinal Alexandre dos Santos says he hopes the pope will
call for reconciliation when he visits the country Sept. 16-19.
   President Joaquim Chissano, who was visiting the pope in the
Vatican when the bishops made their plea, said it was impossible to
negotiate with the guerrillas who, he charged, mutilate children,
burn schools and hospitals, and massacre villagers.
   The guerrilla movement, known as RENAMO, denies such charges and
says it is fighting to replace the Marxist government with a
democratic one.
   ``We hope (the pope) will say something about peace since we are
in this situation of war,'' said Dos Santos, who became a cardinal
in June. ``We don't see how we can end this struggle without
reconciliation. ... It is necessary to have dialogue with these
people.''
   Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said the government hopes the
pope will not appeal for negotiations with RENAMO. He said no one
had the right to suggest that the government ``should talk with
terrorists, with those who commit massacres, ... those who have
been roundly condemned, not only by Mozambique but by the
international community.''
   Job Chambal, director of the government's Department of
Religious Affairs, is overseeing the return of some church property
confiscated when Frelimo came to power at independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   He said of the bishops: ``Our quarrel with them is not the fact
that they called for negotiations _ any Mozambican is free to think
that. The one thing that worried the government was to ... say that
the government as well as RENAMO are responsible for the war.''
   Chambal said the plan to return all confiscated church property
used for worship came coincidentally three months before the pope's
visit.
   ``We were not trying to please the pope,'' he said. ``It's a way
of showing we don't belong to an evil empire.''
   Since 1982, when the late President Samora Machel held meetings
with church leaders, the government has sought to ease tension
between the churches and Frelimo.
   The government invited the pope to visit Mozambique in his
capacity as head of the Vatican state, and it is sharing expenses
with the local church.
   ``It's very expensive, but it's very important,'' Chambal said.
``The willingness of the pope to come to Mozambique means there's
been a very big improvement because people have understood what it
means when we say we have a socialist state.''
   ``We are Marxists, but all of us in government have some
religious background,'' said Chambal, who was reared a
Presbyterian. ``We still have some religious feeling. Even our
revolutionary songs have a religious taste. But our children will
be more Marxist, and teach their children to be Marxists.''
   He said the government wants children to be influenced only by
the state until they are 18, when they can choose whether to go to
church, but this policy is not enforced. In the years immediately
after independence, some churches were closed, services were
interrupted and religious activity was officially discouraged.
   Now churches operate freely. Both cathedral services and prayer
meetings in the bush are packed on Sundays.
   The Frelimo revolutionaries accused Roman Catholic bishops and
priests of cooperating with the Portuguese colonial government and
opposing independence in return for a favored position as a state
church.
   The cardinal says some Portuguese clergymen supported
colonialism, but denies the Mozambican Roman Catholic Church as a
whole was against independence.
   All church-state problems are not resolved, Cardinal dos Santos
said, but he maintained the government does not understand the
church's goals.
   ``They suppose we want only to teach those who want to be
religious leaders,'' he said. ``We also want to prepare the people
for running the country.''
   Dos Santos said that of Mozambique's 14.5 million people, 2
million are Catholics.

   The floor no longer moves beneath Tania Aebi's
feet. The view from her window these days offers more than a vista
of waves and billowing sail. And she no longer spends week after
week alone.
   Life has changed for the young woman whose father sent her off
at age 18 to sail alone around the world because she wouldn't do
her homework.
   Instead of standing by the tiller, Ms. Aebi now spends hours in
front of her computer keyboard, putting down the memories of months
at sea and ports of call.
   But after working nearly a year on her book, Ms. Aebi still
finds ``writing about myself is harder than sailing.''
   The lessons of her 2{-year, 27,000-mile voyage are coming slowly.
   ``I'm ruminating about it,'' Ms. Aebi, now 21, said recently
from her home in Newport, R.I. ``It's not like my life's a neat
pattern yet. It probably never will be.''
   Nonetheless, her life is starting to follow a more conventional
path. The boat recently was sold. She's newly wed to a man she met
on the other side of the planet. And Ms. Aebi and her father have
bridged the personal gulf that sent her sailing around the globe.
   ``Before I left, he lost hope in me,'' she confided. ``He
thought I was a total dud. He was an explorer and I did none of
that.
   ``Father proposed the whole thing to me and didn't give me a
whole lot of options.''
   In 1985, Ernst Aebi, a well-known surrealist painter who lives
in Manhattan, suggested to his bicycle-messenger daughter an
intriguing scheme: In lieu of a college education, he would buy her
a boat to sail solo around the world.
   Ms. Aebi, a difficult student who graduated from an alternative
high school, agreed. Her father says she was ``shanghaied.'' Soon,
the 26-foot sloop Varuna was ordered, and on May 28, 1985, the
neophyte sailor hoisted the sails and was on her way out of New
York Harbor.
   Many thought she wouldn't make it.
   But by the time Ms. Aebi floated through the Panama Canal and
reached the Galapagos Islands she had learned how to use the
heavens as her map. Her seamanship would later be tested when the
boat capsized during a Mediterranean storm and when it collided
with a freighter.
   At the South Pacific island of American Samoa, Ms. Aebi gave a
hitchhiker an 80-mile lift to another island, a generous oversight
that ultimately cost her a pair of world's records.
   The people who keep the books say as a result of that gesture,
the voyage couldn't be classified as single-handed. Ms. Aebi would
have been the youngest person and the first American woman to sail
solo around the world.
   But if she lost something in the South Pacific, she also found
something: Olivier Berner, a fellow adventurer and solo sailor from
Switzerland who was sailing to New Guinea in search of gold.
   He changed course and, sailing his own boat, accompanied her to
Malta. When Ms. Aebi returned to New York last Nov. 6, Berner was
here to welcome her. The couple were married six months later.
   With the elation of accomplishment now displaced by the effort
of writing her memoirs, Ms. Aebi says she has no regrets about the
records she almost captured or the years away from her home,
friends and family.
   ``I'll never be 18 again,'' she said. ``That trip gave me an
opportunity for 2{ years to not worry about the future except for
getting to the next port. I knew what I had to do, which was
ultimately get back to New York.''
   But, does the prosaic pale after a life before the mast?
   ``Life can't be a bore when you have a deadline,'' she said with
a laugh. ``And there are too many things I want to do _ learn a
couple of more languages, read a lot of books and get older.''
   Still, her future remains ``a big question mark.''
   ``I've seen a lot and I've met a lot of people doing different
things, so I see there's a whole world of opportunity out there. I
guess I have bigger horizons.''
   Ms. Aebi's next adventure will be a more conventional drive
across the country in a van with her husband. Another solo voyage
doesn't figure into her plans, but neither does settling down.
   ``I could have bought a house last week,'' she said. ``But when
it came down to paying the mortgage and being attached to one
particular thing, I just couldn't do it. I don't need a house. I
could get a boat.''

   The remnants of Hurricane Florence pushed
inland Saturday as thousands of Gulf Coast residents returned home,
happy to find little damage from 80 mph winds and sheets of rain.
   ``I was expecting to see my little trailer gone. It isn't tied
down or anything,'' Bill Gibson, 58, said as he hauled away a
12-foot-long branch that had fallen from a tree next to his
undamaged trailer house in Venice, near the mouth of the
Mississippi River.
   One death _ that of an Alabama man who drowned Friday trying to
secure a boat against the rising winds _ was linked to the storm,
which was downgraded to a tropical depression by dawn Saturday.
   ``All we lost was a good night's sleep,'' said Wade Guice, civil
defense director for Harrison County, Miss. ``This storm fizzled
out. The hurricane didn't come.''
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern
Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The
National Hurricane Center reported its position late Saturday night
as near latitude 16.0 north, longitude 67.3 west, about 225 miles
southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be nearly 75 mph.
Gilbert was expected drop 5 to 10 inches of rain on Puerto Rico and
the Dominican Republic by Sunday, the hurricane center said.
   Florence hit on the 23rd anniversary of Hurricane Betsy's 1965
landfall but packed little of Betsy's punch. Betsy killed more than
70 people in Louisiana and did an estimated $1.1 billion in damage.
   Damage estimates for Florence were unavailable but appeared to
be relatively minor.
   Crews from the Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness went
out Saturday to assess the damage and start cleaning up, said state
police Trooper Paul Wood.
   Sheriff's deputies said property damage appeared to be minimal
and limited mainly to downed power lines that knocked out
electricity to 115,000 or more homes and businesses.
   Thousands of people ordered to leave homes in nine parishes
Friday returned home when Florence dropped from hurricane to
tropical storm. They found several broken branches and a few bent
or broken signs.
   ``We were expecting the worst and hoping for the best, and we
got the best out of it,'' said Larry Ciko, a spokesman for the
sheriff's office in St. Tammany Parish, across Lake Pontchartrain
from New Orleans.
   A tornado was reported in neighboring Tangipahoa Parish. The
National Weather Service said the tropical depression was pushing a
wide band of showers and thunderstorms into northeast Louisiana,
extreme southwest Arkansas and central Mississippi.
   At 5 p.m. CDT, the National Weather Service said Florence was
centered over central Louisiana, moving toward the west-northwest
and weakening.
   Winds unleashed by Florence never reached the 100 mph that had
been feared.
   Bill Tregre, a spokesman for the two companies that supply
electricity to most of south Louisiana, said the storm cut power to
about 70,000 Louisiana Power & Light Co. customers and about 33,000
customers of New Orleans Public Service Inc. About 6,900 remained
without power Saturday afternoon, but Tregre said he expected all
would have their electricity restored before Sunday.
   Ciko said Central Louisiana Electric Co. officials told him that
12,000 to 14,000 customers were without power at the height of the
storm.
   Although the storm was expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain,
less than 2 inches was reported around most of southeast Louisiana.
   ``The fast movement of the storm kept a lid on the rains,'' said
a weather service meteorologist who refused to give his name.
   Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic storm
season, was the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimal
hurricane strength briefly before hitting Mexican coast last month.

   The former editor of the Dallas Times Herald, C.
David Burgin, has been named vice president and editor-in-chief of
The Houston Post, the newspaper announced.
   Burgin, 49, succeeds Peter O'Sullivan, 39, who said he was
resigning to pursue other opportunities, the Post reported
Saturday. Burgin was editor of the Times Herald until June and is a
longtime associate of William Dean Singleton, whose Houston-based
MediaNews Group owns the Post.
   Singleton said he has known Burgin since 1977. ``His newspapers
have warmth. They have personality,'' Singleton said.
   Singleton also praised O'Sullivan for his accomplishments since
taking over as editor in December 1983. ``The Post under Peter made
dramatic improvements,'' he said.
   Earlier last week, the Post announced that Publisher Don Hunt
was moving to head a new international division of MediaNews. Hunt
had stayed on at the newspaper after the Toronto Sun Publishing Co.
sold it to Singleton's company a year ago. Singleton replaced Hunt
as publisher.
   Burgin said Ernie Williamson will remain as the paper's managing
editor.
   Burgin also was editor of the Washington Star, the Peninsula
Times Tribune in Palo Alto, Calif., the Orlando Sentinel and the
San Francisco Examiner.

   A wealthy civic activist won an upset victory
over Delaware's lieutenent governor Saturday in a Democratic
primary election for the right to challenge a Republican incumbent
in the U.S. Senate.
   With 97 percent or 330 of the 339 precincts reporting, Samuel S.
Beard had 22,418 votes, or 53 percent, to Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo's
19,624 votes, or 47 percent.
   Nine small precincts were not expected to report their results
until Monday, but Woo conceded Saturday night.
   He apologized to his supporters for not running a winning
campaign, and said in a statement, ``I always said it was a tough
way to earn a living,'' according to his press secretary Charles
Siegel.
   ``It was a wonderful victory,'' Beard said, referring to himself
as the underdog in the primary campaign. ``We ran a grassroots
campaign from the beginning. We went into living rooms, all over
the state. We walked through 19 pairs of shoes.''
   Beard faces Sen. William V. Roth Jr. in the November general
election. Roth, who did not have a primary opponent, is seeking a
fourth term.
   The votes represented a little more than a 30 percent turnout of
Democrats eligible to vote in the only statewide race in the
primary, according to John G. Davis Jr., state election
commissioner.
   There were 133,386 Democrats eligible to vote, and average
turnout for a primary is about 20 percent.
   Two Beard campaign workers were detained Saturday night after an
officer caught them taking down about 50 Woo signs throughout New
Castle before dawn Saturday, police said.
   Authorities planned to charge the men with theft and conspiracy,
but a Woo assistant asked that no charges be filed, police said.
   There was no indication Beard had ordered the signs destroyed.
   ``They took them back to the New Castle Armory Building where
Sam Beard's headquarters are located, and they were putting them
into a dumpster there when a town resident called to report the
incident,'' New Castle Police Sgt. Patrick B. Cannon said.

   Woo, 51, born in Shanghai, China, had the financial support of
Asian-American communities, for whom he has become a champion
nationwide.
   Woo, a physics professor at the University of Delaware, was a
political newcomer four years ago when he beat two legislators in a
primary, then went on to win the lieutenant governor's seat by a
slim 479 votes.
   Beard, 49, who inherited his wealth, had the support of party
leaders and loyalists, as well as unions. He is a former staffer of
the late Robert Kennedy, and runs a nonprofit company that helps
attract grants and designs plans to attract economic development.
   Beard was far outspent by Woo.
   Campaign finance reports filed in late August showed Woo with
$407,998 on hand. Beard had only $65,008. Roth had $734,933.
   Woo's ethnic background was targeted recently in an open letter
supporting Beard that was written by Edward ``Pete'' Peterson,
president of the state AFL-CIO.
   The letter said in part: ``It is up to you and I to save this
country not only from the Asian influences the lieutenant governor
refers to, but all foreign influence.''
   Last week, Peterson wrote another letter, apologizing to anyone
who might have been offended by the statement. Peterson said he was
referring to Woo's claims that he has many contact with business
leaders in Asia.

   Miss Minnesota Gretchen Elizabeth
Carlson, who wants to be a Harvard-trained lawyer, became the first
classical violinist to win the Miss America crown in a contest that
required two polls of the judges Saturday night.
   Miss Carlson erupted in tears as her name was announced as Miss
America 1989. She laughed and cried as she took her victory walk
along the runway at Convention Center.
   The first runner-up was Miss Colorado Maya Walker, 23, of Vail;
the second runner-up was Miss Oklahoma Lori Lee Kelley, 23, of
Clinton; the third runner-up was Miss California Marlise Sharleen
Ricardos, 26, of San Pedro; and the fourth runner-up was Miss
Alabama Jenny Lee Jackson, 21, of Auburn.
   Miss Carlson, 22, of Anoka, is a senior at the prestigious
Stanford University in California, majoring in organizational
behavior. As part of her studies, she spent a semester at Oxford
University in England. She plans to attend Harvard Law School.
   ``I'm not a beauty queen. I aspire to go to Harvard Law School.
This is not just for someone who is beautiful. This is for someone
who is educated and sophisticated,'' Miss Carlson told reporters
after winning.
   She said she felt ``shocked inside. I'm trying to remain
composed on the outside.''
   Asked about the first thing she wanted to do, she replied, ``Eat
pizza. That's all I can think about.''
   The 5-foot-3, 108-pound Miss Carlson impressed judges with a
spirited violin piece titled ``Gypsy Airs.'' The piece started slow
and moving, then jumped into a splashy, fast-paced beat.
   Miss Carlson's father, Lee, who attended the pageant, said his
daughter is ``a winner. Everything she does she gives 110 percent.
She doesn't like to lose.''
   Her mother, Karen Carlson, added: ``I think it feels wonderful.
She said she knew she could win.''
   But getting Miss Carlson's name from the judges was not easy. As
television host Gary Collins walked to the judge's area in front of
the stage to learn who had won, he was told there was a tie. It
later turned out to be a tie for second and third places.
   In an affort to kill time, Collins nervously began making small
talk with the contestants.
   There was a flurry of activity in the judge's box.
   Pageant Director Leonard Horn, sitting next to the judges,
tapped his fingers on the edge of the stage as a discussion took
place on what to do.
   Eventually, a second poll of the judges resulted in Miss Carlson
taking the coveted rhinestone-studded headpiece.
   During the wait, Miss Carlson said things were tense on stage.
   ``At that moment, I thought, `Oh, it's all over,''' she said.
   After winning a preliminary talent competition earlier in the
week, Miss Carlson termed parts of her performance ``exquisite''
but vowed to do even better on the final night. She has studied the
violin for 17 years.
   For her performance, the green-eyed blonde wore a black velvet
gown with a sweetheart neckline with dramatic green lame-puffed
sleeves and pleated layered skirts.
   Miss Carlson, who prides herself on being 100 percent Swedish,
had taken special pains during the week to highlight her heritage.
At the Miss America parade on Tuesday, her hair and dress were
decorated with a traditional garland of flowers.
   However, for the evening gown competition, Miss Carlson chose a
long-sleeved turquoise, beaded gown with a silver-beaded design on
the bodice and back.
   Horn, in his first year as the pageant's executive director, has
stressed that the new Miss America will fit into a different mold
than tradition previously held.
   ``Multi-faceted young women who are more than just physically
attractive and talented'' have become the ideal, he said. ``These
are dynamic young college women.''
   In an effort to prove that to a national television audience
Saturday night, the pageant televised video clips of the finalists'
interviews that was part of preliminary judging. Also, the judges
on Saturday night asked an unrehearsed question of each of the top
10 finalists during the evening gown competition.
   The new Miss America succeeds Miss America 1988 Kaye Lani Rae
Rafko, 25, an outspoken nurse from Monroe, Mich., who has
championed AIDS education and safe sex, and preferred to make
charity appearances rather than take paid engagements during the
year.
   Collins returned for his seventh year as host of the finals to
croon the pageant standard ``There She Is'' to the new queen.
Collins' wife, Miss America 1959 Mary Ann Mobley, co-hosted this
year's pageant with the theme ``Success.''
   She also joined Collins in attempting to kill network air time
as the judge's tried to come up with a winner. Pageant officials
said there have been a number of tie situations in years past.
   The 67-year-old Miss America Pageant is the largest contributor
of scholarships to young women, awarding more than $5 million in
scholarships annually to more than 80,000 young women who compete
on the national, state and local levels.
   The new Miss America receives a $30,000 cash scholarship and the
income from a year of personal appearances. Miss Rafko estimates
she earned more than $150,000 during her reign.
   The first runner-up receives a $17,000 scholarship and the next
three runners-up receive $11,000, $8,000 and $6,000 in
scholarships, respectively.
   The remaining finalists each receive $4,000 to be used toward
their educations, and every remaining contestant receives a $2,000
scholarship.
   This year, a new judging system was introduced. The contestants
were interviewed and judged in preliminary competitions by a
preliminary panel of seven judges. On Saturday, a panel of 12
celebrity judges started from scratch after reviewing videos of the
top 10 finalists' interviews.
   Saturday's celebrity judges were: actors Richard Dysart and
Blair Underwood of television's ``L.A. Law''; NBC News
correspondent Deborah Norville; Miss America 1971 and broadcaster
Phyllis George; actor George Peppard; actress Eva Gabor; columnist
Dr. Joyce Brothers; Olympic ice skating gold medalist Brian
Boitano; movie producer Lili Fini Zanuck; model agency founder
Eileen Ford; Parade magazine publisher Walter Anderson; and William
Farley, chairman of Farley Industries.

   The captain of Delta Flight 1141 is not well
enough to talk to federal investigators about the Aug. 31 crash
that killed 13 people, his physician said Saturday.
   Dr. William Thompson issued a statement saying he alone is
responsible for denying investigators from the National
Transportation Safety Board or anyone else a chance to interview
Capt. Larry Davis about the crash.
   NTSB officials have complained that they were being kept away
from the Delta captain by overprotective Air Line Pilots
Association and Delta Air Lines officials.
   Davis is at Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he is being
treated for back and facial injuries, a hospital spokesman said. He
is listed in good condition.
   Thompson ``hasn't given any permission to anyone to talk to
Capt. Davis,'' said the hospital's administrative resident, Paula
Turner.
   Thompson, the assistant director of surgery for the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said Davis will
cooperate with the NTSB investigation later, when his medical
condition improves.
   ``Tentatively, Capt. Davis may talk with the NTSB early next
week, depending on his condition, which may change from day to
day,'' Thompson said in his statement.
   Davis, who was fitted with a back brace Thursday, was up and
walking in his hospital room Friday, Delta spokesman Neil Monroe
said. He also is recuperating from surgery on Tuesday for a
fractured cheekbone.
   Davis was at the controls of the 15-year-old Boeing 727 when it
crashed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport seconds after
takeoff. Thirteen died and 95 others, including the three-man
cockpit crew, survived.
   Co-pilot Carey Wilson Kirkland Jr., 37, who was released from
Northeast Community Hospital in Bedford on Friday, told
investigators he could not remember anything from the time the
plane left the terminal.
   Flight engineer Steven M. Judd, 31, told investigators that the
aircraft's right wing dropped severely shortly after takeoff and
that the airplane veered to the right. Judd said that he heard no
abnormal engine sounds, but that someone in the cockpit had called
out an engine failure.
   NTSB officials have said their inquiry is focusing on possible
problems with the jet's wing flaps and its three Pratt & Whitney
JT8D engines.
   Friends of Davis who have visited the pilot in the hospital said
that Davis told them that the plane's wing flaps were properly set
for takeoff but that the aircraft did not have enough power.

   A 27-year-old man was convicted Saturday night
for slaying five people and wounding two others during a
supermarket robbery.
   Marvin Jennings showed no emotion as the verdict was read, but
his mother and sister were in tears, as were the relatives of some
victims.
   He was convicted of five counts of first-degree murder, two
counts of first-degree assault, one count of first-degree robbery
and eight counts of armed criminal action.
   Prosecutor Gary Randall said he will seek the death penalty in
sentencing hearings set for Tuesday.
   Defense attorney Brad Kessler said he would appeal the verdict.
   ``I can't second-guess what happened in the jury room,'' Kessler
said, noting that the jury was earlier reported to be widely split
on a decision. ``They were under tremendous pressure. You never
know what a jury's going to do.''
   After closing arguments Friday night, the jury met for several
hours, then resumed deliberations Saturday morning. The verdict
came more than 15 hours later.
   Another suspect, Donnie Blankenship, 26, is scheduled to go on
trial later.
   Kessler maintained his client had nothing to do with the crime.
He brought several witnesses to the trial in an effort to prove
that police had used coercion on some of the initial suspects in
the case.
   Investigators said Jennings and Blankenship entered the National
supermarket in north St. Louis after it had closed Sept. 4, 1987,
possibly by posing as a cleaning crew. A security guard was taken
by surprise and was killed, and six other employees were ordered to
lie on the floor and were shot in the back of the head. Two of the
shooting victims survived.

<TEXT>
   President Maung Maung on Saturday bowed to
massive pro-democracy protests and announced that the ruling party
would relinquish its 26-year monopoly on power and hold multiparty
elections.
   An emergency session of Parliament on Sunday approved multiparty
elections in about three months and appointed a group of elders to
supervise polling.
   But key opposition leaders pressed for more political
concessions, including an interim government to cope with Burma's
growing chaos, and sporadic protests continued.
   Millions of people have taken to the streets since March to call
for democracy in Burma.
   The Parliament authorized the Council of State, Burma's highest
governent body, to hold elections in as early as 45 days or the
postpone them beyond the tentative three-month date if necessary.
   It also empowered the council to make necessary changes in the
constitution to reflect a multiparty system, enlarge an Elections
Supervision Commission if necessary and formulate election rules.
   Named to the Elections Supervision Commission were three retired
civil servants, a retired army brigadier and a former member of
Parliament. All are more than 70 years old.
   On Saturday, speaking before 968 delegates at a special party
congress, Maung Maung acknowledged that the party made major errors
and said the interests of the people were paramount.
   
   ``Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,'' he
said in a speech carried by the state-owned Radio Rangoon. ``As
members of the ruling party for a long period, they tended to
forget the interests of the people and lose public confidence.''
   The Western-trained lawyer pledged fair and free elections as
soon as possible. He said he would not be a candidate.
   The broadcast announcer said the decision was unanimously
adopted by the delegates of the Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Maung Maung urged government employees, who have gone on strike
in sympathy with the massive pro-democracy movement, to return to
their jobs and revive his stalled government.
   The government move was another retreat in face of the sometimes
bloody nationwide uprising. The movement has prompted the
resignation of two hard-line presidents, the lifting of martial law
and virtually unimpeded political activities that earlier would
have drawn long prison terms or worse.
   Western observers noted that the anti-government surge came
without any outside support or meaningful resort to arms, although
demonstrators often have compared their movement with those of
other Asian countries.
   ``They were inspired by the triumph of People's Power in the
Philippines ... They were encouraged by the establishment of
democracy in South Korea last year,'' U.S. Rep. Steven Solarz,
D-N.Y., said after returning from Rangoon earlier last week.
   In Washington, the State Department took a cautious stance.
   ``It's still not clear the date or the manner of the elections
that would be held, or whether the government's move will satisfy
the desires of the people,'' spokesman Dennis G. Harter said.
   Maung Maung's government originally planned to meet Monday to
consider a referendum on a general election and a multiparty system.
   On Friday, opposition leader former prime minister U Nu, who was
toppled from power in a 1962 military coup by Ne Win, defied
Burma's authoritarian rulers and declared the formation of a rival
government and elections Oct. 9.
   But three top members of the rival goverment resigned Saturday,
and reliable sources said U Nu had not consulted them about the
announcement.
   Although U Nu, 82, is respected by a large number of Burmese,
diplomats say his age makes it unlikely that he will be anything
more than a ``symbol'' of continuing opposition to authoritarian
diehards.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, an opposition figure and daughter of the
deceased national hero Aung San, told reporters that Saturday's
announcement was ``a positive step,'' but said it could take up to
two years to form parties to contest in general elections.
   ``Under the present economic and political situation, an interim
government will be the best solution. It (interim government) would
deal with economic problems and also hold general elections,'' she
told newsmen.
   Many opposition figures demanded that an interim government be
set up immediately.
   ``Every minute the economic, political and security situation
deteriorates,'' one opposition lawyer said. ``Immediate formation
of an interim government is the only solution. The country won't
hold up until these general elections.''
   Ne Win resigned as head of the ruling party in July, citing in
part widespread street protests in March and June.
   Riots flared when the party chose as his successor Sein Lwin,
who is widely hated for his brutal suppression of dissidents.
Troops fired into crowds of protesters, and the government said 112
people were killed. Western diplomats said the number was much
higher.
   Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, and Maung
Maung was named to replace him. Maung Maung was Burma's first
civilian leader in 26 years.

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert swept
toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted
its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy
rains and high seas.
   The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustained
winds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph.
   ``There is no need for alarm,'' Civil Defense Director Eugenio
Cabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday.
   Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closely
follow Gilbert's movement. An estimated 100,000 people live in the
province, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 miles
west of Santo Domingo.
   Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and
strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The National
Hurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday at
latitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south of
Ponce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo.
   The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said
Gilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a ``broad area of
cloudiness and heavy weather'' rotating around the center of the
storm.
   The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.
   Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastal
flooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to Puerto
Rico's south coast. There were no reports of casualties.
   San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gusts
Saturday, but they subsided during the night.
   On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical
storm and its remnants pushed inland from the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mph
winds and sheets of rain.
   Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic storm
season, was the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimal
hurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast last
month.

   At least 10 people were stabbed, one
fatally, when violence erupted at a rap concert Saturday inside the
Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, police said.
   Three of the stabbing victims were critically injured and two
teen-agers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said.
   It was unclear what led to the stabbings shortly before 9 p.m.
or if they were related, said Nassau County police spokesman
Richard Scibilia.
   There also were reports of several robberies and shots fired in
the arena's vicinity, said Detective Edward Sventoraitis. Police
were planning to make arrests Sunday, Sventoraitis said.
   Some of the stabbing victims were taken to two nearby hospitals,
police said.
   Julio Fuentes, 19, was stabbed in the heart and died at 10:15
p.m. Saturday, shortly after he arrived at the Nassau County
Medical Center, said the center's spokesman, Ed Smith.
   Three other victims were listed in critical condition, Smith
said. They were: Rodney Williams, 22, Dave Johnson, 17, and Greg
Donaldson, 28. Two teen-age boys were hospitalized in stable
condition with multiple stab wounds at Hampstead General Hospital,
said acting administrator Marilyn Hurley.
   The violence came during a festival by six rap groups at the
coliseum on New York's Long Island.
   The groups scheduled to perform in the ``Jam '88'' show included
Eric B. and Rakim, Kool Moe Dee, Doug E. Fresh and the Get Fresh
Crew, Big Daddy Kane, Boogie Down Productions and Biz Markie.

   A 64-year-old man died Sunday morning from
injuries suffered in the crash of Delta Flight 1141 last month,
bringing the death toll to 14, officials said.
   Edmond Fadal, one of two severely burned victims from the Aug.

   Fadal of Waco, Texas, had suffered from third-degree burns over
60 percent of his body and from smoke inhalation, officials said.
His wife, 65-year-old Marian, died in the crash.
   The 15-year-old Boeing 727 crashed at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport seconds after takeoff. The three-man cockpit
crew and 94 others survived.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the
cause of the crash. NTSB officials said their inquiry is focusing
on possible problems with the jet's wing flaps and its three Pratt
& Whitney JT8D engines.

<HEAD>Computer Firms Win Round in Legal Fight Against Air Force</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the largest U.S. computer manufacturers
have won the first round in a fight with the Air Force to be
reimbursed at taxpayers' expense for their legal costs in
challenging Pentagon contracting procedures.
   The General Services Administration's Board of Contract Appeals,
in an Aug. 17 opinion obtained late last week, decided that Digital
Equipment Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc. were entitled to some of
the more than $1 million they are seeking, but did not say how much.
   Rather, in a partial victory for the Air Force, the board
ordered the firms to ``segregate'' legal expenses incurred in
pursuing the portion of the original challenge that they won, and
said they could recover only those costs.
   If the two sides can't reach a settlement, the board said,
additional proceedings will be held to fix the award.
   The Air Force had asked the board to reject completely Digital's
claim for $830,330 and Wang's demand for $210,000.
   The six-page opinion, written by Administrative Judge Vincent A.
LaBella and endorsed by two other judges, marks the latest chapter
in a two-year-old battle over what has been called the computer
contract of the century.
   The Air Force intends to buy about 20,000 mini-computers for use
by all the armed services, at cost of up to $4.5 billion. The
contract is expected to be awarded in the next month or so.
   Digital and Wang, like most other industry firms, expressed an
interest in bidding on the contract in early 1987. But before the
bidding deadline passed, they filed a challenge with the GSA board
charging that the Air Force had rigged the competition.
   The companies complained specifically about a requirement the
computers operate on a UNIX or UNIX-compatible program. UNIX is a
proprietary system developed by American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
and widely licensed to other vendors.
   The Air Force says UNIX compatibility is essential if the
military is ever to standardize its computer systems.
   The GSA board, in its initial ruling last October, backed the
Air Force for the most part, concluding that UNIX had become an
industry standard. ``The decision here is not unlike a
determination to specify either VHS or Beta video recorders,'' it
said.
   But the board also said the Air Force should have spelled out in
greater detail how it intended to use an AT&T test program to
determine contract compliance.
   The Air Force did that in November, when it issued two pages of
amendments to its solicitation before restarting the competition.
Digital and Wang, citing their partial victory, then filed requests
for reimbursement of all legal expenses stemming from the challenge.
   Digital said failure to reimburse would discourage future
challenges and result in ``loss of effective enforcement of the
procurement laws.''
   ``The loser would be competition and thus, ultimately, the
taxpayer,'' the company said.
   Air Force lawyers countered that Digital and Wang had ``lost
this case'' after prevailing on a single, insignificant issue. As
evidence, they pointed to the two companies's withdrawal from the
competition in January.
   The board disagreed, saying that only after the Air Force
corrected its solicitation were Digital and Wang able to determine
whether they should compete on the government's terms.
   Their challenge produced the ``benefit of full and open
competition, which is the touchstone and objective of procurement
law,'' it said.
   Air Force attorney Kevin Vincent said the board's decision was
wrong but that the Air Force had not decided what to do next.
   Wang spokesman Joseph Roy indicated that the Air Force and the
companies had begun discussing a possible settlement, as urged by
the GSA board.
   A spokesman for Digital failed to return a phone call Friday.

   A 74-year-old man suffered a heart attack
while practicing life-saving techniques in a cardiopulmonary
resuscitation course, but was revived by his instructors.
   Melvin Bishop' eyes rolled up and he fell over while compressing
the chest of a practice dummy during the CPR class Saturday at the
Aetna Life & Casualty Co. building, instructor Len Heroux said.
   Finding no pulse, Heroux began performing the same compression
technique Bishop had been practicing.
   Heroux was joined by Carl Ireland, another instructor, who
performed compression while Heroux blew air into Bishop's lungs.
They regained a pulse, then lost it again.
   The instructors were joined by Anthony K. Scierka, director of
field operations for L&M Ambulance Corp. and Professional Ambulance
Service, who was at the site demonstrating his paramedic equipment.
   Scierka put a cardiac monitor on Bishop and determined he had
ventricular tachycardia _ an irregular heartbeat that keeps the
heart from pumping blood _ and gave Bishop's heart an electric
shock with a defibrillator.
   As about 20 stunned students looked on, Bishop's heart began
pumping. He soon regained consciousness and began talking, smiling
and thanking his rescuers.
   Bishop was given medicine intravenously and taken to Hartford
Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition.
   Dr. Ronald H. Pariser, Bishop's cardiologist, said Bishop told
him he wanted to learn the technique because ``he didn't want to
have to stand there helpless'' if someone collapsed.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Push For Preservation Of Cape Cod's Rustic Dune Shacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three members of Congress are urging the
National Park Service to abandon its plan to tear down the rustic
shacks on remote dunes of Cape Cod, Mass., that have inspired
artists and authors including playwright Eugene O'Neill.
   The park service argues that the 18 dune shacks do not have
architectural significance and therefore should not be placed on
the National Register of Historic Places.
   Three Massachusetts Democrats, Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and John
F. Kerry and Rep. Gerry E. Studds, who represents the Cape, are
joining state and local officials in a fight to save the primitive
huts from destruction.
   ``These buildings represent a unique aspect of American history
and culture that should be preserved for future generations,'' they
wrote William Penn Mott, director of the National Park Service,
last week. ``We believe the dune shacks are indeed historic
structures.''
   The shacks, nestled in a two-mile strip of dunes in Truro and
Provincetown at the far end of the Cape, were originally built by
the Coast Guard as shelters from harsh coastal weather. They became
part of the park service's domain in 1961 when President Kennedy
created the Cape Cod National Seashore.
   The shacks' preservation has become an emotional issue in recent
years because the expiration of one-time leases signed when the
national seashore was created, usually for the owner's lifetime or
25 years.
   Preservationists want the federal government to declare the
shacks historic treasures and allow a private organization to
mantain them for public use.
   A study commissioned by the park service concluded that the
primitive structures do not qualify for National Register
protection. But critics say the study focused on the buildings'
lack of architectural importance and ignored their historical and
cultural significance that some proponents compare to that of
Walden Pond, home of Henry David Thoreau.
   With local support growing in favor of preserving the shacks,
the Massachusetts Historical Commission is expected to vote
Wednesday in Boston to urge federal officials to save the
buildings. The park service said it will issue a statement at that
meeting.
   ``I am hopeful that they will decide that in years to come, many
more people will have the same oppportunity for inspiration that
the dune shacks have offered Eugene O'Neill, Harry Kemp, Norman
Mailer and many others,'' Studds said.

<HEAD>Harvard Freshman Want More Study Time, Less Class Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The typical Harvard freshman spends
nearly 41 hours a week in class or studying, doesn't go to sleep
until after 1 a.m., and sometimes loses effectiveness because of
weariness, depression and stress, according to a recent study.
   Keith W. Light, a doctoral candidate in education at Harvard,
asked 63 first-year students to log their days 15 minutes at a time
for one week in March and one week in April.
   ``We assume that because they're coming to Harvard they have
their acts together in every way,'' he said. ``I don't think that's
true, having been a proctor (adviser) living in a freshman dorm for
three years.''
   The study was intended to determine if a time-logging exercise
might be useful to new students and their advisers in helping the
students make better use of their time.
   ``I've always been interested in the freshman experience of
getting used to college life,'' Light said. ``It seems to be that
the actual use of time not only affects a first-year student
academically but also their sense of fulfillment and enjoyment in
the experience.''
   Fifty-six percent of the students said on at least one day that
they were too weary to be productive. Thirty-seven percent said
depression, frustration or stress made them unproductive.
   In addition to logging each period's activities, students were
asked to indicate which ones were most valuable and which were a
waste of time. Television was listed as a common time-waster, but
more students mentioned at least once that a class or a lab was a
waste of time.
   Forty-four percent said they wasted time watching television on
at least one day during the survey period, but 62 percent thought
classes were a waste of time and 54 percent felt labs were little
help. Just 6 percent reported that they wasted time on drinking or
a hangover at least once during the survey period.
   The students said they devoted an average of 5.83 hours a day,
or 40.8 hours a week, to academics, including class time, study
time and lab time. Students generally spend about 15 hours a week
in the classroom, Light said.
   Light said he did not seek a random sample for his survey, but
he got a good cross-section of the freshman class by simply asking
students in two sections of one dormitory to participate.
   He said the 63 respondents from the 1,600-member class was about
twice the minimum sample group for a survey.
   ``It's a carefully done study, but it's modest,'' Light said.
``We're not trying to draw too many earth-shattering
generalizations but get to something that will help them put their
time togther.''
   Seventy-three percent said in retrospect they would have changed
the way they spent a day.
   ``While many students could tell you, `Yes, I do procrastinate'
and `Yes, I don't get enough sleep sometimes' and `I know if I
studied without heavy metal (rock music) in the background I might
be able to concentrate,' the exercise seems to be able to give
students a more realistic views of how they spend their time,''
Light said.
   During school nights, the students got an average of 7.5 hours
of sleep on a school night, but not by going to bed early.
   Seventy-five percent of the students said they didn't get to bed
until after midnight and 61 percent said they were usually up past
1 a.m. Even at 3 a.m., some 12 percent were awake.
   Light conducted follow-up interviews with 24 students and said
most of them found the exercise useful in evaluating the way they
spend their time. This fall, officials asked Light to make the
exercise available to all freshmen who might find it helpful.

<HEAD>Thatcher Suggests Prince Could Be Hong Kong Governor: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has suggested to
Prince Charles that he become governor of Hong Kong in time to hand
the British colony over to China in 1997, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
   The Sunday Times of London quoted from a new biography of the
heir to the British throne, ``Charles,'' by journalist Anthony
Holden. The paper owns the newspaper rights to the book.
   Holden's book says the Hong Kong suggestion was made during a
March 25 meeting between Charles and Mrs. Thatcher at the prince's
London residence, Kensington Palace.
   It followed ``a discussion of the prince's wish that he might in
the longer term be accorded some sort of title to reflect his
increased status in national affairs,'' Holden says in his book.
   However, the appointment of Britain's governor to Hong Kong, one
of the most sensitive posts in Britain's diplomatic service, is
made by Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, not the prime minister.
   Buckingham Palace had no comment on the report, and a spokesman
for Mrs. Thatcher's 10 Downing St. office said Sunday, ``We never
comment on any contacts between the prime minister and members of
the royal family.''
   Holden attributes his information to two separate sources he
says are confidants of the prince's, the newspaper said.
   The author said in a television interview Sunday that Charles,
who celebrates his 40th birthday in November, ``still feels despite
everything that people think he hasn't got a proper job.''
   Charles has been training all his life to succeed his mother,
who is 62 years old and in good health.
   Holden said he thinks the prince would welcome the Hong Kong job
``because it would be seen to give him a higher profile in national
life ... he would be seen to be doing something on the forefront of
the international stage.''

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Hindu
pilgrims plunged into sacred rivers and pools during a solar
eclipse Sunday, believing they would be freed of sin and attain
salvation. Authorities said a 12-year-old boy drowned.
   As the moon partially passed between the Earth and sun,
worshipers chanted hymns and blew conch shells. About 3,000 naked
holy men waded into the giant sacred pools of Sannihit and
Brahmsarovar, followed in turns by an estimated 500,000 men and
women, some clothed, others naked.
   Many carried coconuts, auspicious symbols for Hindus, and set
them in the water. Others gave alms to beggars or Hindu priests,
who offered prayers to the sun. There is an ancient belief that the
sun is in pain during an eclipse and prayers must be offered for
its relief.
   The scene was repeated, in smaller numbers, at rivers and pools
across India.
   An epic Hindu poem, the ``Mahabharata,'' promises salvation to
those who bathe or give alms at Kurukshetra during a solar eclipse.
   Kurukshetra's larger pool, Brahmasarovar, has a two-mile
perimeter. Sannihit's perimeter is about half that size. The pools
can accomodate 125,000 people.
   Thousands of police stood guard and directed traffic in the town
of 25,000 people about 90 miles north of New Delhi. Divers and
lifeguards kept watch over the bathers but could not save the
12-year-old boy from drowning, authorities said.
   The eclipse, which lasted about 90 minutes, was the third in the
past year. The others occurred on March 18 and Sept. 13, 1987.
   According to Hindu legend, Kurukshetra was created by the Hindu
god Lord Brahma and was the scene of an ancient battle in which
Lord Vishnu, the protector of the Hindu diety, pleaded for
righteousness.

   The crash occurred before dawn Saturday as the bus, carrying 60
passengers to a Pacific beach, rounded a curve and struck the
truck, which was pulled to the side of the highway but was not
using emergency lights, police said.
   The bus, owned by the private bus line Cica, was on its way from
Guayaquil to coastal Salinas, 72 miles to the northwest. Police
said the accident occurred 25 miles northwest of Guayaquil.
   Police said 20 people were killed and 40 survived the crash. At

   An 88-year-old woman trying to do her
part to clean up litter was shocked when the discarded grocery bag
she was picking up began moving. Inside was a newborn girl.
   ``I thought, `Well, I'd better pick that garbage up,'''
Katherine Sword said after the child was found Saturday.
   ``Then something moved,'' she said. ``I thought it was a snake
at first, but then I saw the little fingers coming up. I said, `Oh
my Lord, it's a baby, a baby.'
   ``I was awfully shocked to find out it was a baby,'' Ms. Sword
said. ``She didn't cry a bit. Usually, a newborn baby hollers like
the dickens.''
   The 6-pound, 2-ounce infant girl was listed in stable condition
Sunday at St. Mary's Hospital in West Palm Beach.
   Police believe she was born about 30 minutes before Ms. Sword
found her. They were attempting to identify the child's mother, who
could face child abuse charges.
   Hospital spokesman Don Chester said the infant, named only
``Girl Doe'' for the time being, ``appears to be a healthy baby.
When a baby is born outside a hospital, and you don't know the
history ... you always take a wait-and-see attitude.''
   Ms. Sword was returning from the library about 1 p.m. Saturday
when she found the baby. Without touching the infant, she ran to
her apartment and called police.
   ``I was a little worried because it didn't move, but then it
cried,'' said paramedic Ron Rudy.
   Cam Freedlund, a spokeswoman for the state health department,
said the child probably would be placed in a foster home, unless
social workers find that the parents or grandparents are capable of
caring for a newborn.
   ``If I wasn't such a stickler for picking garbage from the
sidewalk, it might not have been found,'' Ms. Sword said.
   ``That was a rough way to leave a child like that,'' she said.

   Kyodo quoted unidentified police sources as saying the

launchers that had not been assembled yet.
   Police believe the group has about 5,000 members.

   A man whose wedding was canceled after he
kidnapped a woman to help finance the ceremony set off dynamite in
a movie theater and killed himself, his girlfriend and eight other
people, a newspaper said Sunday.
   Lan Zhihua, 19, of Baoshan City in southern China, borrowed
several thousand dollars to pay for his wedding, the Peasant's
Daily said.
   Unable to repay the debt, he raised the money by abducting a
local woman and selling her to a man from out of town, the paper
said.
   The woman's father discovered what had happened and insisted Lan
get her back. The paper did not report the woman's fate. When Lan's
fiancee found out about the abduction, she called the wedding off,
the report said.
   Lan, ``at the end of his tether,'' bought dynamite, invited his
former fiancee to see a movie Aug. 14 and set off the blast just
before the end, the paper said. The couple and eight other people
were killed, and 27 people were injured. More than 1,000 people
were in the theater, it said.
   The newspaper did not say why it waited so long to report the
explosion. None of China's other official publications reported it.

   Improved ties between the Soviet Union and
China will help world peace and will not hurt the close bonds
between China and the United States, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci said Sunday.
   ``Our position is that we welcome this dialogue (between the
Soviet Union and China). ... It would be healthy for world peace
and stability,'' Carlucci told the Young Presidents' Organization,
meeting in this British colony.
   Carlucci said America's relationship with China is ``solid''
even if China develops closer relations with the Soviet Union.
   In recent years, China and the Soviet Union have tried to
improve their relations after an era of estrangement over political
and ideological differences.
   Carlucci arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday from China, where he
met Deng Xiaoping and other leaders. He left for Washington after
addressing the Young Presidents' Organization, a private education
and service group based in New York whose 6,000 members became
presidents of their companies before they were 40.
   Carlucci said that in his Beijing talks, it was ``fascinating to
see the confluence of interests'' between China and the United
States on Afghanistan, Cambodia and other international issues.
   On Friday in Washington, the U.S. government announced it would
approve export licenses for satellites manufactured by the U.S.
Hughes Aircraft Co. to be launched by China with its Long March
rocket.
   Private U.S. companies trying to establish satellite launching
services have said they could be priced out of the international
market by China's government-supported launching service.
   Carlucci said the Chinese launch prices are about half the cost
of those in the United States, but he did not specify amounts.
   He said he and Chinese Premier Li Peng had discussed the impact
of the Chinese launches on the U.S. defense industry and the
possibility of China adjusting the price and number of its launches.

   Tamil extremists hacked to death 12
people, including five children, and the government implemented a
plan to try to end ethnic violence in two provinces, officials said
Sunday.
   Five others were seriously injured in the attack Saturday in the
eastern village of Suhadagama, said a military spokesman who spoke
on condition of anonymity. Suhadagama is about 150 miles south of
Colombo, the capital.
   The spokesman quoted witnesses as saying about 20 Tamil
militants stabbed the victims with pickaxes, swords and daggers.
   The dead included four Tamils who were married to Sinhalese
women, the spokesman said. Their wives were not hurt, he said.
   The insurgents were blamed for a similar attack two weeks ago in
which 11 Sinhalese farmers were butchered in neighboring
Polonnaruwaq district.
   Tamil rebels want to set up a separate nation in Sri Lanka's
north and east provinces. The insurgents claim both provinces as
their traditional homeland and have been attacking villages to try
to chase away Sinhalese and Moslem settlers.
   Tamils are mostly Hindu and make up 18 percent of the island's
16 million people. They claim they are discriminated against by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise about 75 percent of
the country's population.
   In July 1987, India and Sri Lanka signed a peace accord aimed at
ending five years of bloodshed. India sent an estimated 50,000
troops to Sri Lanka to try to enforce the agreement.
   India became involved in the conflict because it is the regional
power and because more than 60 million Tamils living in southern
India are sympathetic to the rebels' cause.
   A key provision of the agreement calls for the merger of the
north and east provinces. The union then will be governed by an
elected provincial council that would take over most administrative
and political duties now handled by the federal government.
   The government of President Junius R. Jayewardene announced the
merger on Saturday and said it believes a provincial council will
be chosen by January. The rebels have had no response.
   The Tamil separatist campaign, launched in 1983, has claimed at
least 8,500 lives, including more than 550 Indian soldiers. India
says its troops have killed at least 1,000 Tamil insurgents.

   The toll from the crash of a
Soviet-made Air Vietnam airplane rose to 76 when a stewardess died,
officials said Sunday.
   The stewardess, Ha Mina Hang, died of internal bleeding on
Saturday, hospital officials said. She was among six people rescued
Friday from the wreckage of the Tu-134 aircraft that crashed four
miles before it was to land at Don Muango International Airport
during a flight from Hanoi.
   Among those killed in the crash was Vietnam's health minister,
Dang Hoi Huan, and several diplomats.
   Thai and Vietnamese investigators said Sunday they still don't
know what caused the second worst air disaster in Thai history. On
Aug. 31, 1987, a Thai Airways jetliner crashed into the sea off the
southern resort island of Phuket, killing all 83 people aboard.
   Authorities said the five survivors, including the captain,
navigator, and mechanic of the plane, remained in intensive care
Sunday in local hospitals.
   The head of the Thai investigating team, Srisook Chandrangsu,
confirmed Thai news reports that the captain, Khong Dinh Phuong,
stumbled out of the cockpit after the crash and asked a villager
for a clean shirt and to use the telephone. He was the only
survivor who was rescued conscious.
   Phuong earlier was quoted as saying the plane was struck by
lightning.
   The two inflight recorders containing flight data and the final
conversations between the crew and control tower have been
recovered. The plane last made radio contact with the control tower
one minute before it crashed, the general manager of the
international airport said Sunday.
   Weather officials at the airport said skies there were clear at
the time but that strong winds and heavy rains buffeted nearby
areas.
   During its final radio contact, the plane was flying at about
1,600 feet and was believed to have lowered its landing gear and
wing flaps for an emergency landing, said the airport manager,
Charoon Peetong.
   Vietnamese Prime Minister Do Muoi sent a team of investigators
to the site to work with Thai authorities in determining cause of
the accident ``and to resolve all consequences arising therefrom,''
state-run Radio Hanoi said Saturday.
   Japan's Nihon television network Saturday quoted Vietnamese
officials as saying Vietnam's 16-member Olympic team canceled their
seats on the flight only two days earlier.
   The Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok said the victims also included
Vietnam's ambassador-designate to the Philippines, Nguyen Dhuong
Vu, and several lower-ranking government officials.
   Diplomats said the dead included India's ambassador to Vietnam,
Arun Patwardhan, and seven officials of his embassy; the second
secretary of Japan's embassy in Hanoi; and the second secretary of
the Australian Embassy in Hanoi.
   Many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition.
   The Tu-134, the Vietnamese flag carrier's main aircraft, is used
by the Soviet airline Aeroflot, although several have crashed in
recent years. One Tu-134 crashed in Siberia last February; another
crashed in October 1986, killing Mozambique President Samora Machel.
   The Japanese aviation magazine Kokujoho says the Tu-134, which
first flew in 1963, is no longer produced. Air Vietnam officials
say they would like to switch to newer, Western-made planes but do
not have enough money.

   Radical students burned an effigy of
President Roh Tae-woo on Sunday and accused the government of
staging the Olympics to strengthen military rule.
   The demonstrations at Seoul's Yonsei University were peaceful
and there were no reports of arrests or injuries, in contrast to
the violent clashes with police on Friday and Saturday.
   ``Oppose the half Olympics!'' shouted about 350 students,
referring to North Korea's boycott of the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Games in
Seoul after its demand to be a co-host for the Games was denied.
   The protesters chanted ``Yankee go home!'' as they marched to
the front gate of the university in eastern Seoul. The students
charge that the United States is helping the Roh government to use
the Olympics to strengthen what they say is a dictatorial rule.
   ``We do not oppose the Olympics itself,'' said a student, who
requested anonymity. ``But Olympics is staged by a military
government for propaganda purposes. The military government led by
Roh oppresses the masses.''
   Leaflets distributed by students at a rally before the effigy
burning included a picture of the interlocking Olympic rings made
of barbed wire superimposed on a photograph of Olympic Park.
   Several thousand police armed with tear gas and other
riot-control weapons watched the demonstrations from across the
busy street in front of the university. The government has ordered
police to avoid using tear gas during the Olympics.
   Radical students, who have called for anti-Olympic protests,
have so far demonstrated on a few campuses in Seoul and other
cities. They have not protested near the Olympic sites.
   The radicals, a small but vocal minority on campuses, have
virtually no public support among most South Koreans. Many
government officials say they believe radicals are controlled by
communist North Korea.
   Radical students claim that Roh is a front for continued
military rule and say they are determined to topple the government.
   Roh, a former general who won the presidential elections in
December, has introduced broad democratic reforms and dismantled
authoritarian controls. His popularity among the South Korean
people has risen steadily since he took office in February.
   Students marching to Yonsei's main gate on Sunday carried a
6-foot-high pole wrapped in gasoline-soaked rags, with a frowning
paper face representing Roh tied to it. The effigy was torched
while students sang protest songs and marched with flags and
banners. After the demonstration, the students dispersed
voluntarily.
   Protests at Yonsei University erupted into violence Friday and
Saturday when students, some armed with wood and iron clubs, threw
firebombs and rocks at police.

<HEAD>Flight 655 Compensation Unlikely Until After Reagan Leaves Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families of the 290 people killed in the U.S.
downing of Iran Air Flight 655 are unlikely to receive compensation
during the remaining months of the Reagan administration, officials
say.
   President Reagan pledged to offer compensation soon after the
U.S.S. Vincennes shot down the plane over the Persian Gulf, but the
plan still faces two steep hurdles _ the bureaucratic and legal
obstacles caused by a lack of communications between the United
States and Iran, and its continued unpopularity on Capitol Hill.
   ``I think we're a long way from payments actually being made, if
they ever actually are,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee.
   ``It's a hard sell up here on Capitol Hill. There's not a lot of
support up here for Iran,'' he said. ``And in addition, you have a
lot of questions _ who do you actually pay, how do you get them the
money, how do you make sure it goes to the families and not to the
government of Iran?''
   The case involves the destruction of Iran Air Flight 655, shot
down July 3 by the Navy cruiser Vincennes in the Strait of Hormuz
shortly after taking off from Bandar Abbas. All 290 persons aboard
were killed when the Vincennes fired two missiles in the mistaken
belief that the unidentified plane was an Iranian military F-14.
   U.S. officials expressed regret and Reagan decided July 11 to
offer compensation to families of the victims, but the plan quickly
ran into opposition in Congress. Legislators were reflecting a
decade of public unhappiness with Iran and its leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, dating back to Iran's taking of American
hostages.
   A Navy investigation, headed by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty,
found last month the shoot-down was due to a series of
stress-caused human mistakes made by a crew in combat for the first
time.
   But the Fogarty report also laid some blame on Iran, criticizing
that country for permitting a commercial airliner to fly over a
Navy warship that had been engaged in a firefight with Iranian
gunboats.
   While the Navy was investigating, the State Department began
trying to answer the myriad of questions raised by Reagan's
announcement.
   For example, the questions of who gets the money is unanswered.
The United States and Iran have no diplomatic relations and Iran
has not yet even furnished a manifest with the names of the
passengers.
   Another question is how much to pay.
   One congressional official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the amounts range from $50,000 to $250,000 per victim.
   Congress will carefully scrutinize any plan the State Department
develops.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said, ``I'm willing to consider
compensation, but I don't want one penny to go to the government of
Iran.''
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said the Fogarty report underscores the
need for compensation, ``but we have to be careful that none of the
money goes to the government.''
   While the United States is offering compensation, U.S. officials
point out that the Soviet Union has refused to pay anything for two
incidents in which the Soviets shot down Korean Airline planes. In
one incident, in 1978, two passengers were killed, and in the
other, in 1983, 269 people were killed, including 60 Americans.

   The scrawled note by Michael Dukakis about a
controversial prison project turned out to be prophetic: ``This
spells mucho trouble. Let's discuss. MSD.''
   Later, the Massachusetts governor penned another message to his
legal counsel on a plan to build a prison in the tiny central town
of New Braintree: ``No further action until we discuss. MSD.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee had correctly predicted the
storm of controversy that would surround the plan. But his 1985
notes displayed something else about Dukakis that has become more
visible on the campaign trail: his instinctive caution when he
smells trouble.
   That has been the Dukakis management style through recent,
largely crisis-free years, as governor. The style, born of a
first-term disaster, has been an easy one to adopt in a state with
a boom economy and little opposition from Republicans.
   But on the campaign trail, as the presidential race tightens and
he comes under relentless criticism by Vice President George Bush,
Dukakis has given indications that he wants to turn more aggressive.
   That was much in evidence when he re-hired John Sasso, the
campaign chief who was ousted after releasing the tape that led to
Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race.
   Dukakis took some heat for the decision. But he got his way, and
fallout was minimized by his timing: he made the announcement at
the start of the long Labor Day weekend.
   ``I don't think he sees himself as a great risk-taker. He
doesn't place a high value on that,'' said Martin Linsky, a
lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government who was a
Republican colleague in the state Legislature.
   Dukakis' cautious approach to the Sasso affair reflected lessons
he learned in 1975, when, trying to keep a strong campaign promise
of ``no new taxes,'' he held out until forced to impose tax
increases and spending cuts that angered both the right and left.
   ``Going down the street with him, the verbal abuse he would take
from people was quite unbelievable,'' said Thomas P. O'Neill III,
son of the former House speaker and Dukakis' lieutenant governor in
1975. ``I really think he had such confidence in his ability to
handle the (deficit) problem that that would have an overriding
effect on the public relations end of the problem.''
   Joseph Grandmaison, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic
Party, managed Dukakis' 1974 campaign for governor and recalls a
politician much more willing to make snap decisions then than he is
now. ``Back in the early '70s he was far more likely to look at a
situation and come to an immediate conclusion about what was the
best way to proceed,'' he said.
   The lesson was clear, said Paul Garrity, the former judge who
pushed the administration into the Boston Harbor cleanup project:
``Once burned, twice shy.''
   After he won back the governorship in 1982, Dukakis kept a tight
rein on news emanating from the governor's office and from the many
state agencies. No press release bearing Dukakis' name went out
without being personally checked by the governor. Press aides kept
lists of ``good'' and ``bad'' reporters, broken down by those whose
coverage favored or hurt the administration.
   ``He's taken more seriously the communications aspect of
government,'' Linsky said.
   The much-heralded transformation of Dukakis from his early years
in office to his two recent terms was not entirely complete, Linsky
said. Dukakis once again this year finds himself wrestling with a
state budget shortfall. Although the crisis isn't as serious as in
Dukakis' first term, he has had to sign a cigarette tax into law to
help raise tax revenues.
   ``One of the ways to think about the pattern of not dealing with
revenue problems until fairly late in the game is that if he
doesn't want it to be a problem, he doesn't see it as a problem,''
Linsky said.
   In 1986, Dukakis used the hunker-down approach to distance
himself from disclosures that state officials had approved a
$10,000 payment to silence a student who charged a state college
president with sexual assault.
   The governor recalled first hearing about the alleged assault
and the payoff in January 1986. He said he told a top state
education official to ``get on it'' and ``take care of it.'' But
Dukakis did nothing further to investigate until the story
intensified six months later.
   For more than a year Dukakis let two top administration
officials handle questions on the New Braintree prison issue even
amid charges _ later refuted _ that Dukakis had granted a personal
favor to friends who owned the prison site.
   He also kept a back seat when a prison furlough program that he
deeply believed in came under fire when a convicted murderer on
furlough terrorized a Maryland couple. He reversed the furlough
policy as public opinion was reaching a crescendo.
   But a cautious approach to governing that kept Dukakis out of
trouble in Massachusetts hasn't translated into safety on the
campaign trail.
   Early this month Bush scored political points by coming to
polluted Boston Harbor to highlight an example of what he called
the consequences of excessive delay. Dukakis was forced to defend
himself by saying that after a decade as governor, something was
finally being done to clean the harbor.

   Iraq's use of poison gas against its Kurdish
minority is prompting concern that other nations bogged down in
armed conflict might resort to the ``silent killer'' in violation
of a universally accepted ban on use of chemical weapons.
   According to U.S. officials, there is little question that
Iraq's use of mustard gas against Iranian forces influenced Iran's
decision to end their eight-year old Persian Gulf war last month.
   Almost immediately after the cease-fire took effect, Iraq
launched an offensive against its Kurdish minority as suspected
collaborators with Iran. Tens of thousands of Kurds were forced to
flee into southern Turkey.
   Last week, about nine days after the first reports of Iraqi
chemical warfare began to circulate, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said he was convinced the allegations were true.
   Shultz accused the Iraqis of ``unjustifiable and abhorrent''
behavior. The Senate then unanimously approved stringent economic
sanctions against Iraq.
   Iraq's minister of state for foreign affairs, Saddoun Hammadi,
met with Shultz on Thursday and called the charges ``absolutely
baseless.''
   But well before the latest Iraqi assault on the Kurds, a number
of United Nations investigations concluded that Iraq _ and to a
lesser extent, Iran _ had engaged in chemical warfare since 1984.
   The State Department has sharply criticized Iraq from time to
time and unanimous U.N. Security Council resolutions have done the
same. But the international reaction generally has been muted and
unsustained, possibly reflecting the lack of global sympathy for
Iran's fundamentalist Islamic regime.
   Last May, Iran complained that the absence of punitive measures
against Iraq was having a ``disastrous'' effect. Indeed, a U.N.
report issued two months later said that use of chemical weapons
against Iran was ``intensifying and has become more frequent.''
   The 1925 Geneva convention banning use of chemical weapons,
which was signed by 105 nations, was seen as a major step toward
humanizing armed conflict and assuring that the horrors of poison
and nerve gas attacks in World War I would never be repeated.
   That optimistic view has been changed by the Persian Gulf war
and its ghastly aftermath, foreign affairs analysts say. They are
now concernd that other war-weary nations may conclude that the
benefits of using chemical weapons may outweigh the costs.
   Some U.S. officials privately share the conclusion of Steven
Rose, a neurobiologist at Britain's Open University, who was quoted
in Time magazine as saying that despite a ``major act of genocide,
the fact is, Iraq has got away with it.''
   Elisa Harris, of Britain's Royal United Services Institute,
agrees with that assessment, according to Time. She said other
Third World countries might follow Iraq's example believe that they
``might not have to pay a high political price.''
   The Geneva convention outlaws use of ``asphyxiating, poisonous
or other gases and of bacteriological methods of warfare'' that can
cause vomiting, choking and skin irritation or worst, a speedy
death.
   In 1915, when exposed to German-deployed lethal chlorine near
the Belgian town of Ypres, 5,000 French troops were killed and
10,000 others injured in a single afternoon. World War I claimed an
estimated 91,000 soldiers dead and 1.2 million wounded of gas
attacks by both sides.
   Although 60 million are said to have died during World War II,
chemical weapons were not used, possibly because of the deterrent
effect of knowing that all sides had extensive chemical arsenals.
   President Nixon banned manufacture of chemical weapons in 1969
but President Reagan ordered its resumption last December in the
belief that a new deterrent was needed.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have discussed ways to
limit chemical weapons, and the issue is being debated by a
40-nation Conference on Disarmament.
   But progress toward agreement has been slow, and the State
Department is worried there may be a trend toward greater
proliferation of chemical weaponry.

   A group of black churchgoers from Florida was
allowed to enter Israel on Sunday, two days after being turned away
on suspicion some belonged to a controversial sect, a Foreign
Ministry official said.
   The 35 followers of the Rev. S.D. James of Opa-locka, Fla.,
charged Friday they were harassed by Israeli border guards at
Jordan's Allenby Bridge crossing and denied access to the West
Bank. Opa-locka is 12 miles north of Miami.
   The Israeli official said Sunday the group was stopped because
``there were suspicions that 10 of the group belonged to the Black
Hebrews.''
   Israel has long had a dispute with the predominantly American
Black Hebrews sect, which claims its members are Jewish and have
the right to settle in the Jewish state.
   ``Everything was clarified, and this morning they were allowed
to cross the bridge into Israel,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He did not elaborate.
   James on Friday accused Israeli soldiers of shoving members of
his group and forcing them back onto their bus. James said he
formally complained to the U.S. Embassy in the Jordanian capital of
Amman.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war.

   Top government officials touring
Yellowstone National Park expressed shock at the extent of forest
fire damage and promised changes in firefighting policies and more
soldiers to battle the flames.
   ``There's no way you can capture the thing like being here,''
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. ``Just look at it _
devastating. ... Look at the natural beauty that's been interfered
with.''
   ``I think it's devastating. We've said before, it's a
disaster,'' Interior Secretary Donald Hodel replied when asked his
impressions during the stopover Saturday at Yellowstone.
   ``The extent of the burned area we've just driven through is
more than you can imagine,'' Hodel added.
   Officials who briefed them were not optimistic about getting the
situation in hand anytime soon.
   ``The potential for controlling these fires is not very great,''
Lyng said. ``This is a terribly difficult situation.''
   Montana Gov. Ted Schwinden, who along with Wyoming Gov. Mike
Sullivan joined the Washington officials on the visit, was somber
after hearing a briefing on the fire situation.
   Schwinden said the officials were told: ```There are three
breaks you can get as firefighters. One is a break in the weather,
a break in the topography, and a break in fuels.'
   ``I asked, if there's no break in the weather, are there breaks
in fuels or topography? And they haven't worked to this point. So
unless we see some major precipitation, I think we'll see a
substantial spread'' of the fires.
   Unless there is generous snow this winter, the area could
actually continue to have fire problems next summer, a veteran
forest ranger said.
   ``We periodically have fires that will hold over through the
winter and start up again in the spring,'' Skip Starkey, a fire
management specialist and 11-year veteran of the Forest Service,
told reporters during Saturday's official tour.
   While the weather may not cooperate, additional human resources
will be sent into action, officials said.
   The Pentagon had earlier supplied about 2,300 Army soldiers from
Fort Lewis, Wash.
   Deputy Defense Secretary William Taft IV announced at Old
Faithful that they would be joined by two Marine battalions _ 1,200
men _ from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and two additional Army
battalions.
   ``So by the end of next week, we will see a doubled
representation by the military in this effort,'' Taft said.
   ``We have a fair amount of air equipment here, and
helicopters,'' Taft added. ``We'll be bringing in more of that,
too.''
   Canadian firefighters also will be pressed into service, thanks
to congressional approval last week of enabling legislation, Lyng
noted.
   Hodel promised at a West Yellowstone news conference that the
Interior Department would make changes in its fire suppression
policies to avoid a similar situation in the future. That brought
applause from an audience of townspeople who have been highly
critical of the way the summer's fires have been handled.
   Hodel and others, however, reiterated their assertion that
nature, not mismanagement, was to blame.
   ``You know, it's OK for people if they want to blame somebody
for what has been a dreadful natural experience,'' Lyng said. ``But
I've been involved all summer with this drought, and I can tell you
that, wherever you go in the North American continent, you see the
effects of the worst drought that we've ever had. And this fire is
one of them.''
   Hodel added: ``This year, if they'd been able to foresee the
kind of conditions we've got, they would have been fighting every
fire from the beginning.
   ``In fact, all the destruction we've driven through was a fire
that they fought from the beginning and couldn't control it,''
Hodel said, referring to the North Fork fire which destroyed
buildings at Old Faithful geyser and threatened West Yellowstone
and park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs.
   ``I think the key is to get these fires out, and then review
what's going on,'' Hodel said.

   Life at the fire camp for
the Clover-Mist forest fire might not be quite as comfortable as
home, but now the firefighters can at least see what's going on in
the rest of the world.
   The camp sits on a sagebrush-covered plateau near the Crandall
Ranger Station along the western border of the Shoshone National
Forest.
   Until Saturday, firefighters with time off from the fire lines
on the 322,000-acre fire relied on a videotape collection of movies
to while away the hours.
   Now they've got a television satellite dish and can tap into
just about anything being broadcast, said Bill Mack, who works for
Rezek Equipment Co., a San Bernardino, Calif., company that
provides fire camp services and which helped arrange for the dish.
   ``This is just so the guys will have something to watch,'' said
Carl Hopkins, who work for Aqua-One, another California company
that normally provides shower and water purification equipment to
fire camps and decided to throw in the satellite dish.
   While it's not unusual for fire camps to have televisions and
videocassette recorders for entertainment, Hopkins said he hasn't
heard of any other camps getting their own satellite dish.
   ``This is kind of an experimental thing,'' agreed Mack.
   The signal from the dish runs to a 40-inch television set in the
``Grand,'' a large canvas tent equipped with 17 log benches and a
wood-burning stove for the cold Wyoming nights.
   Live television isn't the only benefit enjoyed by the
Clover-Mist firefighters. There's a truck-based laundry service
that processes two tons of clothes each day; hot and cold showers;
a small library; and a tent phone booth with two direct-dial phones.

<HEAD>Ministers Criticize U.S. For Supporting Israel, South Africa</HEAD>

   The foreign ministers of the 101-nation
non-aligned movement Sunday criticized the United States, South
Africa and Israel and expressed support for Nicaragua.
   In a statement at the end of their four-day annual conference,
the ministers charged that the situation in South Africa and Israel
has ``worsened considerably'' and reiterated a call for sanctions
against both.
   The conference, which was attended by 95 of the 101 members,
condemned South Africa for ``acts of genocide'' against its black
population and a ``policy of state terrorism.''
   The ministers ``expressed their indignation and dismay that
certain Western nations ... continued to aid and abet apartheid
economically, financially, politically and diplomatically.''
   They said they regret that efforts by the U.N. Security Council
to impose sanctions on South Africa were blocked by American and
British vetoes.
   The ministers called on the United Nations to take over
``temporary supervision'' of the Israeli-occupied territories to
protect Palestinians from the ``acts of terrorism and atrocities''
by Israel. More than 260 Palestinians have been killed in the
10-month-old uprising, and thousands have been detained. Five
Israelis also have died.
   The non-aligned movement Friday drafted a resolution supporting
the Palestine Liberation Organizaion's plan to declare an
independent Palestinian state in the occupied territories. The
ministers called for the non-aligned movement to financially aid
the Palestinians.
   The resolution emerged from a session by the conference's
nine-member Palestine committee, which includes the PLO, Cuba,
Senegal, India, Yugoslavia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Algeria and
Bangladesh.
   On another subject in the final statement, the ministers
expressed support for the leftist Sandinista government of
Nicaragua, a member of the non-aligned movement, and demanded an
end to the financing of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   In a separate document, the ministers said prospects for the
world economy were ``gloomy'' and that the ``prolonged crisis in
the international economic situation'' was widening the gap between
the developed and the non-aligned and other developing countries.
   The report called for the lowering of interest rates, the
reversal of the flow of resources from developing to developed
countries and an increased access to the markets of the developed
countries.
   The conference also adopted a special ``Nicosia Declaration,''
which mandates a special committee appointed by the conference to
take steps to streamline the organization of the movement.
   Many of the delegates to the conference criticized the
non-aligned movement for becoming stagnated and losing its
credibility.
   The conference ended with the choice by consensus of Yugoslavia
_ one of the founding members of the movement in l961 _ as the host
of next year's summit conference of non-aligned states. This
automatically gives it the chairmanship of the movement for the
next three years.
   Yugoslavia emerged as a compromise when two other declared
candidates, Indonesia and Nicaragua, failed to win a consensus.

   Unless nature is generous with
moisture in the coming months, fires in Yellowstone National Park
could continue to burn until next summer, a veteran forest ranger
says.
   ``We periodically have fires that will hold over through the
winter and start up again in the spring,'' says Skip Starkey, a
fire management specialist and 11-year veteran of the U.S. Forest
Service.
   ``Certainly there is a possibility for that to happen,'' he
says. ``It would depend on what kind of snow we get this winter,
what kind of rain we get this fall and next spring.''
   Starkey, based at the Bozeman headquarters of the Gallatin
National Forest in Montana, escorted a group of reporters and
photographers Saturday during a visit to the park by Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and
Assistant Defense Secretary William Taft IV.
   Although there have been technical advances in fighting forest
fires, including infrared aerial photography, computer modeling and
sophisticated weather analysis, Starkey said:
   ``Firefighting ... is not an exact science by any stretch of the
imagination. There's still a lot of art to it.''
   He pointed out various fire patterns in the lodgepole pine
stands along the 30-mile stretch of road between West Yellowstone
and Old Faithful. In some areas flames skipped randomly, blackening
some trees and sparing others. The fire ``crowned'' other sections
of forest by jumping from treetop to treetop. And in other areas
less-intense flames crept along the ground, leaving an ashen forest
floor but trees that were still green and healthy.
   ``You don't get a continuous, complete burn all over'' in a
forest fire, he explained. ``It's like a mosaic.''
   Starkey said many of the dead trees on the forest floor were
killed not by flames but by lodgepole pine beetles. And with its
shallow root system, the lodgepole pine can easily be blown over in
a stiff wind.
   This provides a major source of fuel for advancing fires, but
the lodgepole pine actually depends on fires to release its seeds
from their cones, Starkey explained.
   During the drive between Old Faithful and West Yellowstone, rain
began to fall.
   ``This sprinkle isn't going to help, except it raises the
humidity,'' Starkey said. ``Spots don't ignite as easily. ...
There's less of a chance it will result in a fire.
   ``This is the biggest benefit from a day like this. You can get
in there and work close to the fire. ... The fire is less able to
generate explosive behavior.''
   But the rain continued and grew from a mere sprinkle to a
respectable drizzle.
   ``That's the kind of weather I like,'' Starkey said. ``I'd like
to see about two weeks of this.''

<HEAD>NASA Official Says Shuttle Launch May Take More Than One Try</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the nation's space flight program
cautioned Sunday that NASA might not be able to launch space
shuttle Discovery on the first attempt late this month.
   ``I think that when we get do get to a launch date on the latter
part of this month, it wouldn't surprise me at all if it took us
two or three times to get airborne,'' said Rear Adm. Richard Truly,
the head of the shuttle program.
   Truly, who is NASA associate administrator for space flight,
said that if two recent successful simulations of crew and launch
systems had been the real thing, a launch would not have taken
place because of weather and winds.
   ``We're going to wait until we have it right, and then we're
going to do it,'' said Truly, a two-time shuttle astronaut. ``I
think the American people expect that of us and that's what we're
going to do.''
   Appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' Truly
shied away from revealing a date for the launch of the first
shuttle since the Challenger exploded on liftoff in January 1986,
except to say it probably will be late in September.
   ``It will be the last week in September unless there is a
hiccup,'' he said.
   Truly said the date will be announced after a two-day flight
readiness review at Cape Canaveral, Fla. on Wednesday.
   He said there has been no administration pressure to have the
shuttle program restart before the election for whatever political
advantage that might give to George Bush.
   ``I've felt a lot of stresses in the last 2 1@2 years,'' said
Truly, ``but, thank God, that's not one of them.''
   Asked what he would say if such a call came from a high
official, Truly replied: ``I'd say, not on my watch.''

<HEAD>Communist Party Fete Draws Huge Capitalist Crowd</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LA COURNEUVE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bourgeois capitalists set up tents
beside leftist guerrillas and Yves St. Laurent showed couture gowns
at the annual celebration of French Communism.
   Hundreds of thousands of people attended the weekend ``Fete de
l'Humanite'' in this working class suburb north of Paris. It opened
with the fashion show Friday and closed Sunday with a speech by
party boss Georges Marchais.
   L'Humanite is the French Communist newspaper. A similar fair for
the Italian Communist Party daily L'Unita took place in Campi di
Bisenzio outside Florence.
   The French festival was reminiscent of huge country fair
complete with carnival rides, Kewpie dolls and acres of food.
   But ideology was everywhere.
   Bumper cars faced stands emblazoned with a huge
hammers-and-sickles. ``Glasnost'' T-shirts, referring to the Soviet
campaign for greater openness, were a hot item. Game prizes
included a free trip for two to the Soviet Union.
   Stands offering Russian caviar and tea served from samovars
competed with hundreds of others serving Brittany crepes, Alsatian
choucroute and every sort of French regional dish.
   An African National Congress booth sold buttons of the South
African guerrilla group's jailed leader, Nelson Mandela. Nearby
were stands where representatives from the Dutch electronics firm
Phillips and the German high-tech corporation Telefunken pitched
their newest products.
   ``The customers are not our usual ones, but there are so many
people here we can't really afford to miss this,'' said an
encyclopedia salesman, who had a volume opened to an entry on Karl
Marx and a sign saying he accepted credit cards.
   The variety of booths this year is greater than ever and may
reflect an effort by the party to modernize its stodgy, doctrinaire
image to conform with changes in French society.
   Since Socialist President Francois Mitterrand reinvigorated his
party after his election in 1981, French Communism has been in
steep decline. Once capable of winning a quarter of the popular
vote, the party's official candidate, Andre Lejoinie, garnered only
6.8 percent of the vote in presidential balloting last spring, the
lowest score since the party was founded in 1920.
   Analysts blame the fall on several factors, including the
inability of the party to adapt to modern society where the number
of blue collar workers has significantly diminished, reducing the
ranks of traditional Communist faithful.
   Voters now tend to be better educated, more sophisticated and
less doctrinaire.
   ``Like everywhere in Europe the Communist Party in France, the
agent of modernization for decades, is now obsolete,'' said the
French newspaper Le Monde in an article Sunday under a headline
``The Identity Crisis of the Communist Worker.''
   But one Communist worker, Daniel Gauter, disagrees. A bus driver
from the southwestern town of Angouleme and secretary of the local
party, Gauter is hopeful that the upcoming district elections will
show an increase in Communist strength.
   At his fair booth Saturday night, Gauter served two girls a
plate of steaming snails and talked to them about the elections.
   ``One of those girls was unemployed and doesn't vote,'' Gauter,
35, said afterward. ``She said she would vote with us at the end of
this month and I think she will.
   ``Anyway,'' he said, ``she likes our party.''

   Parliament on Sunday yielded to weeks of
massive nationwide protests and approved holding the first
multiparty elections since 1960.
   The legislature appointed a group of elders to supervise the
polling and set a target date for about three months from Saturday,
when President Maung Maung announced the ruling Burma Socialist
Program Party would relinquish its 26-year monopoly on power.
   Despite government concessions, opposition leaders continued to
press for an interim government to cope with Burma's growing chaos,
and demonstrations continued in the capital.
   Maung Maung issued a stern warning to demonstrators, who have
taken to the streets by the millions since spring in their fight
for democracy.
   ``People are now fed up with this lawlessness and are expecting
the government to take effective action,'' Maung Maung said. ``I
therefore warn those responsible for the lawlessness to cease such
activities.''
   In some areas of Burma, he said, students and Buddhist monks
were setting up rival local governments, creating ``a grave and
dangerous situation for those responsible.''
   ``It is essential to remove them immediately,'' he said.
   He called on demonstrators to get back to work and on civil
servants to reactivate the stalled machinery of government. In
addition, he attacked the recent formation of a rival government by
former Prime Minister U Nu.
   Maung Maung called Sunday's decision ``a milestone in Burmese
history.''
   ``It will be evident in 20 years' time whether the decision was
correct or not,'' he told the 489-member Parliament.
   While authorizing elections in about three months, Parliament
also held out the possibility that they could be postponed or held
as early as November.
   Parliament empowered the Council of State, the highest
government organ, to change the Constitution to permit a multiparty
system, enlarge the elections commission if necessary and formulate
election rules.
   Named to the Elections Supervision Commission were three retired
civil servants, a retired army brigadier general and a former
member of Parliament. The men, all over 70 years of age, are
generally regarded as neutral, although not especially prominent.
At least four are not members of the ruling party.
   The Parliament session was held under tight security, and
delegates slept in the building Saturday night. The area was
cordoned off with barbed-wire fences and road blocks manned by
troops.
   The multiparty elections would be the first in Burma since Feb.
6, 1960, when U Nu's Clean Anti-Facist People's Freedom League won
a massive victory over an army-backed party. U Nu was overthrown by
the military on March 2, 1962. The coup, led by Gen. Ne Win,
ushered in rigid one-party rule.
   Maung Maung urged Burma's 22 million voters to ``use their
potent weapon _ the vote _ to choose the right representatives.''
   ``Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,''
Maung Maung told the party congress Saturday, quoting the 19th
century British historian Lord Acton. ``When one has power, one
wallows in its luxury, and when one has no power one thirsts for
it.''
   The Western-trained lawyer and author, the country's first
civilian leader in 26 years, said he would not run in the elections
and the powerful military ``will not lobby for any party in the
general elections.''
   A Western diplomat in Rangoon said the Burmese people were
highly skeptical of the recent government moves.
   ``They don't trust the government to keep this promise'' of
elections, said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``They perceive it as another trick.''
   Meanwhile, 218 dependents of diplomats and non-essential
staffers, including 59 Americans, left Rangoon Sunday on a special
Thai Airways International flight to Bangkok, Thailand.
   Yuji Kurokawa, counselor at the Japanese Embassy, said there
were 102 Japanese aboard, including eight officials; three Burmese
married to Japanese; 32 United Nations officials and their
families; and some West Germans and Britons. He said the Americans
included embassy dependents and aid officials.
   More than 230 people flew out Friday as a precautionary move.
   ``All the people who wanted to come out have come out'' and
there will be no more evacuations for now, Kurokawa told The
Associated Press.
   In recent weeks, the government has made one concession after
another.
   Ne Win resigned as head of the ruling party in July, citing
widespread street protests in March and June as a factor in his
decision.
   When Sein Lwin, a hard-liner widely hated for his brutal
suppression of dissidents, was chosen to succeed him, riots
erupted. Troops killed 112 protesters, the government said, but
Western diplomats said the number was much higher.
   Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, and Maung
Maung was named to replace him. Martial law was lifted and
activities that before would have drawn prison terms or worse were
allowed.

   A car bomb exploded on a busy street near the
Pakistani Embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday, killing 10
people and injuring about 40 others, Tass said.
   The official Soviet news agency blamed Afghan rebels.
   ``The crime prepared and committed by Afghan extremists claimed
the lives of some 10 people, including women and children,'' Tass
said. ``According to preliminary information, another 40 Kabul
residents were injured.''
   A building near the Pakistani Embassy was seriously damaged, as
were 40 stores and 10 cars, Tass said. It provided no other details.
   In Peshawar, Pakistan, near the Afghan border, six people were
injured when a bomb went off in a crowded marketplace near a
garment shop, said a police spokesman.
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, but Pakistan
blames such terrorist activities on the Soviet-trained Afghan
secret service Khad. Peshawar in the headquarters of the
anti-communist Afghan guerrilla movement.
   The U.S.-backed insurgents are fighting to overthrow the
Soviet-backed government of President Najib.
   Rocket and other blasts have become almost daily in Kabul, the
Afghan capital, since the Soviet troop withdrawal began on May 15.
   Kabul authorities have blamed all of them on the insurgents, but
Western diplomats believe some bombings are part of long-standing
factional infighting between communists loyal to President Najib
and a rival faction that dominates the military.
   Under an agreement signed April 14, the Soviet government is
withdrawing the estimated 115,000 soldiers it had stationed in
Afghanistan, leaving the fighting to Afghan government forces.
   The Soviet soldiers are to be entirely withdrawn by Feb. 15.
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan have complained bitterly to the
United Nations and to Pakistani authorities that Pakistan continues
to assist the guerrillas.
   The Soviets entered Afghaninstan in December 1979, replaced one
Marxist regime with another and backed that regime against the
guerrilla uprising.

   The federal and state prison population grew
by 4 percent in the first six months of 1988 to a record 604,824
inmates, with female prisoners increasing at a far higher rate than
males, the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics said Sunday.
   The Justice Department agency said the six-month increase of
23,240 prisoners would require adding 900 new prison beds every
week.
   Lawrence Greenfeld, bureau director of correctional statistics,
attributed the increase partly to stricter parole supervision, with
a higher number of parole violators being returned to prison, and a
wider use of mandatory minumum sentences for repeat drug offenses
and other serious crimes.
   The gain in female prisoners reflects a trend toward more
frequent drug convictions among women than men, Greenfeld said.
   He said the six-month increase in all federal and state
prisoners fit the pattern of similar growth in the past two or
three years, resulting from revised sentencing guidelines by the
states.
   The largest percentage increases from Jan. 1 through June 30
occurred in Rhode Island, which reported 17.9 percent more inmates;
the District of Columbia had 13.6 percent more, and New Hampshire,
12.8 percent, the bureau said.
   California, which added 5,146 inmates for a 7.7 percent increase
during that period, accounted for 22 percent of the nationwide
growth in the prison population and housed nearly 12 percent of all
federal and state prisoners, the report said.
   Another record reported by the bureau was the number of
prisoners with sentences of more than one year _ 237 per 100,000
U.S. residents _ compared with 139 such prisoners at the end of
1980.
   The bureau said the number of female inmates grew 6.7 percent so
far this year, compared with 3.9 percent for males.
   Since 1980, the number of female prisoners has increased 130
percent to a total of 30,834 last June 30. Male prisoners increased
by 81 percent in the same period, to a total of 573,990, the bureau
said.
   During the full year ended June 30, state prison populations
grew by 6.2 percent, reaching 555,666 inmates, while the number of
federal prison inmates increased by 3.2 percent to a total of
49,158.

   Actor River Phoenix says he is reminded of
his own childhood by his role in the new film, ``Running on
Empty,'' in which he portrays the son of 1960s activists who are
constantly on the move.
   The son of 1960s flower children, Phoenix, 18, says he and his
four brothers grew up poor and moved to Oregon, Florida, South
America and Mexico.
   ``Moving calls for adjusting to a new place and learning not to
get attached,'' he says. ``I liked it because I saw a lot of
different lifestyles.''
   Phoenix and his family now live on a 17-acre farm in Florida.
   The actor says he wants the public to see him as he really is.
He says the images teen magazines paint of him are inaccurate.
Phoenix won't take roles he believes are morally or ethically
wrong. He is a strict vegetarian and more interested in the fate of
the world than money.
   ``I wanted money so we could buy a great place of land and be
self-contained,'' he says. ``That impresses me; that feels good. It
feels like something's been accomplished.''
   Meanwhile, he is considering other movie scripts and will have a
cameo role in the new ``Indiana Jones'' sequel.

   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson joined a
Russian Orthodox clergyman and other dignitaries Sunday at the
Soviet Union's first golf course for the opening of the driving
range.
   The golf course, near the Swedish Embassy in south Moscow, is a
project organized by former Swedish hockey player Sven Tumba and
Soviet sports officials.
   Those who attended the opening said they were seeking peace
through sports.
   ``I'm sure that sports promotes friendship and I'm deeply
convinced that the birth of a new game in the Soviet Union will
bring about new contacts among people in various countries who will
find a lot of new friends,'' Tumba said, according to a report by
the Tass news agency.
   Former Brazilian soccer star Pele, who also attended the
opening, said, ``I'm sure that sports will lead to peace in the
world.''
   Tyson is visiting Moscow with his wife, actress Robin Givens,
who is filming episodes of her TV series ``Head of the Class.''
   Plans call for a nine-hole course along the Setun River with
double tees on each hole, allowing it to be used as an 18-hole,
par-68 course.

   U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper capped a week of
celebrations marking his 88th birthday with an outdoor party and
fireworks show at Miami's Bayfront Park.
   ``I'm just pleased that people have been so gracious to me this
week,'' said Pepper, who's been in Congress since 1962 and was a
U.S. senator from 1936-51. About 1,000 people turned out for the
event Saturday evening.
   ``The congressman wanted to share his birthday not just with the
hotshots of Washington, but with the people of South Florida,''
said Miami's vice-mayor, Rosario Kennedy.
   Among those paying tribute to him last week were President
Reagan, Vice President George Bush, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas.
   ``Few legends live long enough to hear themselves called
legends,'' Dukakis said in a message sent to Pepper.
   Pepper said Reagan called him on Thursday, his birthday.
Saturday was the birthdate of Pepper's late wife, Mildred.
   ``I told him we need to have more old folks at the head of
things. He laughed and said he agreed,'' Pepper said.

   Sting, Bruce Springsteen and other
artists drew a sell-out crowd to an Amnesty International global
rock tour concert to promote the defense of human rights.
   More than 90,000 fans crowded this northeastern city's Camp Nou
Stadium on Saturday to see Springsteen and fellow American folk
singer Tracey Chapman perform along with Sting, Peter Gabriel and
Senegal's Youssou N'dour.
   From a wide stage surrounded by a turquoise and green global map
emblazoned with ``Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' the
stars played their best-known songs as the crowd clapped and sang
in unison.
   One poster seen waving bore the tour's slogan, ``Human Rights,
Now!''
   The concert formed part of the 20-city tour across five
continents marking the 40th anniversary of the United Nations
Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
   Sting told reporters Friday: ``In all the countries we visit,
including my own, there are violations of human rights. No one is
innocent.''

   Pope John Paul II appealed Sunday for
reconciliation, racial harmony and human rights in southern Africa,
a region teeming with tribal, racial and political problems.
   John Paul's first full day on his tour of the region was crammed
with events, beginning with a meeting with the country's seven
Roman Catholic bishops and ending with a session with diplomats.
   In between, he celebrated a 2{-hour Mass before more than
200,000 people, met with members of the laity and spoke to 30,000
youths at a jammed sports stadium.
   His comments did not have the political edge that they did
Saturday, when he arrived here for 10 days of travel through five
black-ruled countries that are neighbors to white-led South Africa.
   On Saturday, the pope talked of powerful political, economic and
ideological forces that endanger the stability of the region and
who fomented ethnic and tribal conflicts.
   Though he did not identify any country, he clearly linked South
Africa to his comments when he said they were ``true for the grave
issue of apartheid,'' Pretoria's system of racial segregation.
   In a symbolic gesture toward the South African Catholic Church,
the pope invited the former archbishop of Capetown to join his
official party for the rest of his five-nation Africa tour.
   And in another development aimed at creating what the Vatican
called ``an atmosphere of conciliation,'' a spokesman welcomed
Monday's meeting between South African President P.W. Botha and his
Mozambican counterpart, Joaquim Chissano.
   Chissano's government alleges that South Africa supports an
11-year-old guerrilla insurgency in Mozambique.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters that Cardinal
Owen McCann, 71, archbishop emeritus of Capetown, would travel on
to Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique on the pope's plane.
McCann, who is white, is considered a moderate.
   Politics did not figure in John Paul's talks with diplomats.
Instead, he urged the officials to use their influence to help
Africa with its food problems, refugees and development.
   ``The countries of Africa themselves must be in charge of their
own development and historic destiny,'' he said. ``Outside aid is
urgently needed, but it will only be helpful in the long term if
the essential force of growth and development is truly Africa.''
   The pope celebrated Mass from a scaffold altar the size of a
small house at Barrowdale Park race course. Tens of thousands of
people _ many from the neighboring countries of South Africa,
Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania _ sat on the ground in the infield.
Thousands more crowded the VIP stands.
   Parish choirs sang traditional hymns to the accompaniment of
animal skin drums and trumpets made from antelope horns.
   Before the Mass began, three women carrying on their heads clay
pots filled with water climbed the steps of the towering altar and
kneeled before the pope.
   Water-filled pots are traditional symbols of welcome and
hospitality in southern Africa.
   As John Paul accepted the gift, the crowd _ which included
President Robert Mugabe _ applauded and chanted in Shona, the
tribal language of 70 percent of Zimbabwe's 8.5 million people,
``Makadii sekuru pope,'' meaning ``Welcome pope.''
   The Polish-born pope delighted the crowd by responding in Shona,
``Rugare ngaruve nemi,'' or ``Peace be with you.''
   Zimbabwe has nearly 1 million Catholics. Though raised a
Catholic, Mugabe no longer attends church except for state
occasions.
   Several of Mugabe's Cabinet ministers lined up to receive
communion as scores of priests waded into the crowd. But Mugabe
kept his seat in the grandstand, 820 feet from the altar.
   The most rousing welcome of the day for the pope came from the
youths who greeted him with cheers and the din of hundreds of
traditional rattles made from gourds with seeds inside.
   ``Remember, when God looks at you, he does not see a black face,
or a white face, or a brown face= he sees the face of his son,
Christ,'' the pope told the youths.

   The House faces renewed anti-drug amendment
battles this week, including votes on proposals to fine drug users
$10,000 and induce states to take away their right to drive.
   As lawmakers resume amending their all-inclusive drug fighting
bill on Wednesday, they also must decide whether to retain a
seven-day waiting period for handgun purchasers, along with an
optional police background check.
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., will try to eliminate the gun
control language from the 375-page bill that would add some $2
billion to the nation's $3.9 billion war on drugs.
   His proposed substitute would establish a system for gun sellers
to run a check by phone or other means, to determine if a purchaser
is a convicted felon.
   Congress also is wrestling with a number of other domestic and
foreign issues this week: abortion, insider trading, job leave,
sanctions against South Africa, child care, welfare reform and
textile import curbs.
   The House drug bill likely will receive a final vote Thursday or
Friday. Last week, those favoring the harshest possible penalties,
won amendment battles that attached provisions for a federal death
penalty, denial of government benefits for twice convicted drug
users, and court admission of evidence seized illegally by police
acting in ``good faith.''
   Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh, interviewed Sunday on
NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said he supports the change in
evidence rules because ``time and again, because of some technical
shortcoming _ the failure to dot an `i' or cross a `t,' an
important drug kingpin or other criminal can be turned loose.''
   He said he also supports provisions affecting government
benefits, but opposes a change that would authorize the CIA to
conduct covert operations against drug operations overseas.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics, said on the same show the death penalty was
morally wrong and would not deter ``bums that are dealing in
drugs'' who attach little value to human life.
   He said it also would make it more difficult to obtain
extraditions of drug suspects from countries opposed to the death
penalty.
   Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, expressing his personal opinion,
told reporter last week he supports the handgun waiting period.
   ``I can't see that it's an infringement on the rights of any
law-abiding citizen to have a simple waiting period,'' he said.
   ``If you've got to have a gun right this minute, you've got to
have some violent intent. A responsible person wouldn't mind
waiting seven days.''
   The National Rifle Association has told lawmakers that criminals
would obtain guns regardless of the waiting period, and that only
law-abiding citizens would suffer from the delay.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., will propose civil penalties of up
to $10,000 per violation against those found to be in possession of
small ``personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaine, and other
controlled substances.
   Proof of guilt for a civil offense only requires ``clear and
convincing evidence,'' while a criminal conviction demands proof of
guilt ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   Conflicting amendments will be offered that could affect the
drivers' licenses of anyone convicted of drug offenses, including
possession.
   Rep. Glenn M. Anderson, D-Calif., would provide up to $125
million over three years to states with drug enforcement programs
that include license suspension or revocation for convicted drug
offenders.
   McCollum will counter with a plan to require withholding a
portion of U.S. highway money from states failing to enact
suspension or revocation provisions.
   The Senate must decide what to do with a $140 billion social
programs spending bill that has but one area of disagreement
between the two houses _ abortion.
   Senators previously passed the legislation with an expansion of
the Medicaid program to cover abortions for rape and incest
victims. The House last Friday refused to accept that provision of
the Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services spending bill.
   The Senate is expected to give final approval and send the House
a bill that would freeze this year's textile and apparel imports at
1987 levels and allow 1 percent annual growth thereafter. It would
bar increases in non-rubber footwear import levels.
   Proponents say the measure, which President Reagan is expected
to veto, would save jobs in the import-ravaged textile and apparel
industries. Critics contend the industry is no longer suffering.
   In the House, passage is expected for an insider trading measure
which, for the first time, would make it possible for securities
firms to be fined for violations committed by their employees. It
also would increase prison terms and fines.
   Some key measures won't reach the House floor this week.
Supporters of a bill to guarantee unpaid, job-protected leave for
new parents have postponed a planned vote this week as they
continue to negotiate compromises.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has scheduled a Wednesday
vote on House-passed legislation to impose harsh new sanctions on
South Africa, including a cut off of virtually all U.S. investment
in the country because of its apartheid policy.

   Flood waters began to recede Sunday,
and the government said it has received $236 million in aid to
fight the destruction and disease caused by the worst floods in
memory.
   Thousands of lives were threatened by diarrhea caused by
drinking water contaminated with sewage and garbage washed up by
raging flood waters, health officials said.
   More than 200,000 people have contracted the disease and at
least 123 have died from it, said the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The disease kills by dehydration.
   As river levels began to fall after two weeks of flooding, many
residents returned to their homes, said officials at the Flood
Control Center. They said they expect the water level to drop
quicky starting Monday.
   The floods covered three-quarters of the nation and 53 of the
country's 64 districts, with a population of 30 million, said
Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman.
   He said 866 people have died of drowning, snakebites and
disease. The government figure is considered low, and newspapers
estimate at least 1,532 people have died.
   ``The world has responded promptly and generously to our appeal
for help to the flood victims,'' Rahman told reporters.
   He said the United States pledged $150 million in aid on
Saturday, in addition to $2.6 million committed earlier. More funds
and relief supplies have arrived from Japan, the Soviet Union, the
European Economic Community, India, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,
among others, he said.
   The Soviet Union has offerred 100 tents, 1,000 blankets and 100
tons of medicine, he said.
   Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French President Francois
Mitterrand, will visit the flood-affected areas during her four-day
tour starting Monday.
   Rahman estimated the damage from flooding would exceed $1.4
billion and that 6,000 to 10,000 tons of grains stored in
warehouses were damaged or destroyed by water.
   The government of Hussain Muhammad Ershad is struggling against
a shortage of helicopters and boats to get food and medicines to
people stranded in the countryside.
   Hundreds of volunteer organizations, many run by Christian
missionaries, are aiding in the massive relief effort, but
reporters have visited areas where the first relief supplies did
not arrive until Saturday.
   ``We are pooling all our resources to ensure relief, but we do
not have sufficient volunteers to reach all the places in a short
while,'' Rahman said.
   He said, however, that the country has enough food to meet
immediate needs and that the government would ensure ``that nobody
dies of starvation during the floods.''
   Rahman said he hoped the flooding of the past few weeks ``would
be nature's last big slap to this impoverished nation this year.''

   A Greyhound bus driver collapsed and died
at the wheel, sending his bus crashing into several trees on a
freeway median while a passenger tried to bring it under control.
Three people were injured.
   James Maxwell, 60, collapsed with an apparent heart attack about
11 a.m. Friday near this town 45 miles south of Richmond, said Liz
Hale, a spokesman for Greyhound-Trailways Lines in Dallas.
   Passenger Richard Lee Stallings of Wake Forest, N.C., saw
Maxwell collapse and grabbed the steering wheel while trying to
remove the driver from his seat, said trooper P.E. Israel of the
Virginia State Police.
   The northbound bus began to veer into southbound lanes of
Interstate 85, and Stallings was unable to keep the bus on the
road, Israel said. But he did keep the bus from crashing into
oncoming traffic or overturning.
   The bus hit several trees in the median before stopping. Three
of the 21 passengers were injured, including one woman who was in
stable condition Sunday.

   Consider yourself warned.
   A hefty helping of granola or whole-wheat bread could contain
enough natural LSD to produce mild high. The dragons of fairy tales
really may have existed, and a violent collision between Earth and
a swarm of comets is overdue.
   Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, which concluded its
annual meeting at Oxford University, 50 miles northwest of London.
   The association was established in 1831 to promote general
interest in all branches of science.
   While it still produces some of the most important and advanced
research in Britain, its annual meetings are also a forum for more
far-fetched concepts, designed to stimulate debate.
   For example, eating eight to 10 slices of whole-wheat bread or a
large bowl of granola or bran flakes in one sitting may induce a
mild euphoria because of wheat's natural LSD content, said Dr.
David Conning, director of the British Nutrition Foundation.
   LSD, a popular hallucinogen in the 1960s, is produced naturally
by ergot, a common fungal infestation of wheat that may survive
food processing, Conning told the meeting.
   He said a high-bran diet could result in a daily consumption of
100 micrograms of LSD, or four times the minimum dose needed to
produce an effect on an inexperienced user of the drug.
   David Unwin of the Palaeontological Institute in Moscow told the
conference the dragons of fairy tales may have existed. He said
they were flying dinosaurs with 16-foot wingspans and dominated the
skies 140 million years ago.
   Speaking of dinosaurs, Walter Alvarez, a professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, said the only possible
explanation for their extinction 65 million years ago was a
six-mile wide asteroid hitting Earth with an explosive force equal
to 100 million megatons of TNT.
   As proof, Alvarez cites the amount of the metallic chemical
iridium in rocks laid down at that time. Iridium is rare in the
Earth's crust, he said, and the high levels found in rocks of that
era must have come from an extra-terrestrial source.
   Dr. Victor Clube, an astrophysicist at Oxford University, warned
that a collision between Earth and a swarm of comets is overdue and
will certainly happen within 100 years. In a worst-case scenario,
it will produce effects similar to a nuclear war, he warned.
   Meanwhile, man's best friend got a new look at the meeting.
   Dr. Willem Hackmann of Oxford's Museum of the History of Science
exhibited a computerized watchdog that uses ultrasound, or
high-frequency sound waves, to detect intruders.
   Hackmann said the watchdog's snarl gets louder and louder as the
intruder approaches, but he admitted the sound is more like a
rumbling thunderstorm than a canine bark. ``There are hopes of
improving that,'' he said.
   Oxford's Professor Michael Brady said a robot guide dog for the
blind is in the early stages of development, but still needs
refinements.
   The robot, which also uses ultrasound, could now guide a blind
person along an uncluttered street, but would have trouble
separating individual objects or people in crowded areas, Brady
said.
   ``Currently, robots aren't as smart as a year-old sheep,'' he
lamented.

<TEXT>
   Unions vowed Sunday to shut down
the capital and Argentina's main cities to protest the government's
use of force to break up an anti-government rally.
   The strike, which will affect schools, banks, public
transportation and government offices, is set for Monday.
   The labor unions said the walkout was in response to a police
break-up of a rally on Friday that was part of a national strike to
protest President Raul Alfonsin's economic reforms.
   Thirty-seven police officers were among the 113 people injured
when police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to
disperse a crowd of 20,000 union members.
   ``The unusual and ferocious attack, unacceptable in a democracy,
was perpetrated by forces of repression more interested in beating
innocent demonstrators than guaranteeing the security of people and
property,'' the General Labor Confederation said Sunday.
   Teachers, bank clerks, bus drivers, construction workers, public
employees and other groups in the capital, Buenos Aires, and in the
cities of Cordoba, Rosario and Mar del Plata said they would stay
off their jobs in support of the strike.
   The strike also has been endorsed by the center-left Peronist
Party and leftist Communist, Socialist, Intransigent and Christian
Democrat parties.
   Alfonsin said in a statement that his government would guarantee
the ``security of the services of public transport throughout the
country.''
   The president's center-right Radical Civic Union says security
forces intervened in Friday's rally to stop fighting and vandalism
that already had broken out.
   Alfonsin's program of economic reforms are aimed at curbing
inflation that has soared to 440 percent in the past year and a 14
percent unemployment rate. Personal incomes have declined for three
straight years.
   The unions contend the anti-inflation plan Alfonsin introduced
in August does not allow wages to keep pace with cost-of-living
increases and that the government must resort to repression to
support an economic program that is unpopular.
   The 3.5 million union members also oppose Alfonsin's efforts to
sell off inefficient state industries, which employ tens of
thousands of union members.

<DATELINE>HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new battle is brewing at the site
of one of the South's greatest victories in the Civil War, this
time pitting federal historians trying to preserve the battlefield
against local officials who want to make the land available for
commercial development.
   The conflict centers on the battlefield where Gen. Stonewall
Jackson led 14,000 Confederate troops in a three-day siege in 1862,
eventually forcing the 12,500-man Union army to give up, the
North's largest surrender of the war.
   The battleground's location along a highway just outside Harpers
Ferry National Historical Park makes it ideal for development.
Harpers Ferry is at the easternmost tip of West Virginia, just an
hour's drive from the Washington metropolitan area and its booming
real estate market.
   National Park Service officials, however, want to preserve it as
it was during the Civil War.
   ``It all happened right there,'' said Donald Campbell, Harpers
Ferry national park supervisor. ``It's a highly significant piece
of American history _ it's certainly the most important battlefield
in the state of West Virginia.
   ``It's just inappropriate to go in there and start digging with
bulldozers. Young soldiers fought and died for their country on
that land.''
   The Jefferson County Commission, however, recently zoned the
privately owned land for high-density housing. Commission President
Garland Moore said the panel didn't see any reason to hold back the
land.
   ``The federal and the state governments own a large hunk of
Jefferson County already,'' Moore said. ``You can't keep taking
land off the tax books and expect to survive.
   ``There was a lot of Civil War activity in Jefferson County. If
we set aside every piece of land in Jefferson County that Civil War
troops fought on, we wouldn't have anything left.''
   The park service can't control what is done with land outside
its jurisdiction and therefore must appeal to the county and state
governments to fight development, Campbell said.
   ``Preserving anything is up to the people,'' Campbell said. ``If
the people want it preserved, history will be preserved. If they
don't, history will be lost. We can only raise the issue.''
   The dispute at Harpers Ferry is not the only battle over
development at a Civil War site around Washington. Plans to
construct a shopping mall outside the Manassas Battlefield National
Park in northern Virginia, site of two important battles, have
drawn strong opposition.
   Moore said the commission's zoning ruling on the Harpers Ferry
site is not necessarily permanent. ``We're certainly willing to
listen,'' he said.
   The park service and the Harpers Ferry town government already
have enacted easements sharply restricting construction in sight of
the historic town, where abolitionist John Brown conducted his
infamous raid in 1859 when West Virginia was still part of
Virginia. The town, much of it preserved in pre-Civil War
condition, is one of the state's top tourist attractions.
   ``We adopted the plan to restrict ourselves,'' said Harpers
Ferry Mayor Bill Brawley. ``The mass majority of the people like
what we have _ we don't want townhouses or apartment houses in the
town.''
   But Brawley said attempts to build in the area surrounding the
park have provoked ``a continuing battle'' between local government
and the park service.
   ``They don't want any development anywhere,'' Brawley said.

   The driving range of the Soviet Union's first golf
course opened Sunday in a ceremony attended by dignitaries ranging
from heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson to a leading Russian
Orthodox clergyman.
   The golf course, near the Swedish Embassy in south Moscow, is a
project organized by former Swedish hockey player Sven Tumba and
Soviet sports officials.
   Those who attended the opening said they were seeking peace
through sports.
   ``I'm sure that sports promotes friendship and I'm deeply

   Former Brazilian soccer star Pele, who also attended the
opening, said, ``I'm sure that sports will lead to peace in the
world.''
   Among the others who attended the ceremony were Tyson and
Metropolitan Pitirim of the Russian Orthodox Church, who said
sports help people understand what they have in common.
   Plans call for a nine-hole course along the Setun River with
double tees on each hole, allowing it to be used as an 18-hole,
par-68 course.
   The plans also include rental and sales of golf equipment, a
Russian-language instructor, a clubhouse with restaurant and a
business club with a conference room and secretarial services.
   A pro-am tournament tentatively has been scheduled for September
1989.

   Newly crowned Miss America Gretchen
Elizabeth Carlson, a classical violinist and Stanford University
student with hopes of law school, said Sunday she plans to become a
corporate executive.
   ``I'm definitely an overachiever,'' she told reporters.
   ``This wasn't luck,'' said Miss Carlson, entered in the pageant
as Miss Minnesota, said of her selection as Miss America 1989. She
added that she is not superstitious and brought no good-luck charms
to the pageant.
   Miss Carlson, 22, of Anoka, Minn., performed a spirited violin
solo titled ``Gypsy Airs.'' She has been studying violin for 17
years, winning national and state competitions and performing a
solo with the Minnesota Orchestra.
   After winning a preliminary talent competition last week, she
confidently told reporters parts of her performance were
``exquisite.''
   Pageant officials took pains this year to emphasize that the
judges were looking for an ``articulate, educated, dynamic role
model'' and not a beauty queen.
   Miss Carlson was crowned early Sunday by her predecessor, Kaye
Lani Rae Rafko. The selection of Miss America 1989 was delayed
almost 12 minutes when judges had to cast new ballots to break a
tie for second runner-up.
   During the delay, Miss Carlson said, ``I'd lost confidence. ...
I really thought it was all over at that point. I saw a judge look
down at a book and look at a picture and shake their head and I
thought, `Oh, no, it's me!'''
   Miss Carlson is several credits away from graduating from
Stanford with a degree in organizational behavior. She said she
would like to attend Harvard Law School ``and become a successful
corporate executive.''
   For the next year, she will tour the country promoting not only
the Miss America scholarship program but also the products of the
pageant's corporate sponsors, including underwear, orange juice,
pantyhose and hair coloring.
   Miss Rafko, a registered nurse, used her reign to promote the
nursing field.
   Miss Carlson said she would like to focus on ``education for the
children of tomorrow.'' Specifically, she would like to see
children receive more education on values, ``teaching children to
be less narcissistic.''
   ``Today children tend to be more in love with themselves instead
of being in love with other people,'' she said.
   When asked what kind of Miss America she would make, Miss
Carlson laughed and replied: ``A short one.'' She stands 5-foot-3.
   Miss Carlson, a green-eyed blonde of Swedish descent, admitted
she lightens her hair with hair coloring but said contestants
``should not be allowed to change their bodies'' through cosmetic
surgery, as some have.
   Miss Carlson said that when she was 16 she weighed about 128
pounds. She now weighs 108.
   ``When I used to be fat, my brothers used to call me `blimpo,'
'' she said. ``I wanted to go out with the star basketball player
at school and he said, `She's such a nice girl but she's just a
little too plump.'
   ``So I went on this major diet and lost all this weight and then
he wanted to go out with me, but I said no.''
   Miss Carlson also said she would like to see the Miss America
pageant include a scholarship category. The competition now has
talent, swimsuit, evening gown and interview categories.
   Leonard Horn, pageant executive director, said, ``It's not a new
suggestion. The problem is that grade point average doesn't always
mean that much. ... There are a lot of successful people whose GPA
wasn't that enviable.''
   The last Miss Minnesota to win the title of Miss America was
Dorothy Benham in 1977.

   Yellowstone National Park
Superintendent Bob Barbee says critics of the park's fire policy
who blame the policy for major forest fires are directing a
``lynch-mob, hang-him mentality'' at him.
   Critics have ``an hysteric view that the area is on fire because
of a misguided fire policy,'' he said in an interview Saturday.
``Such a view, that the entire American West is on fire because of
a fire policy, is ridiculous.''
   Barbee was disputing recent comments by firefighters and
residents of park gateway communities that the Yellowstone fires
could have been put out early if he had let firefighters use heavy
equipment such as bulldozers and chain saws.
   The national park fire management policy calls for minimal use
of motorized and heavy equipment.
   Barbee said he ``absolutely feels fine'' that Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel supported Yellowstone's fire management practices
during his tour of the fires Saturday.
   But Hodel said Sunday in Boise, Idaho, that the Park Service's
16-year-old ``let burn'' policy didn't work under this year's
extremely dry conditions.
   ``The old policy has to be reviewed and altered,'' Hodel said at
the Boise Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates fire
suppression throughout the country. ``Nobody who has seen it
operate this year could say it was a success.''
   During the 16 years, 16,000 fires burned a total of about 30,000
acres in the park, Hodel said. But currently, nearly 900,000 acres
of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres are involved in flame.
   ``We'll see a new policy in place before the beginning of the
next fire year,'' he said. Until then, each new fire will be
suppressed with all the equipment and manpower available.
   Barbee said he and other firefighting professionals ``have
nothing to apologize for.''
   ``The very idea staggers me that people boo the efforts made to
control the fires,'' he said. ``The best firefighting technology in
the world is being used here.''
   Barbee said he is ``sorry that people cannot accept the fact
that conditions are so extreme'' and make firefighting difficult.
   Tourism will not decline in Yellowstone because of the fires,
Barbee insisted. He said people will continue to visit the park to
see the thermal features such as the geysers and the wildlife.
   Barbee said that in the past the park has not purposely lit
fires to get rid of dead lodgepole pines that have helped fuel the
fires because it isn't a practical method to get rid of dead trees.
   Under normal weather conditions, lodgepole pines, which covered
80 percent of the park before the fires, ``do not burn quickly and
easily,'' he said. And Yellowstone's rugged terrain does not make
it easy to control planned burns, he added.
   Anyone who thinks planned burns would have prevented the present
fire problems, he said, is ``chewing lotus seeds.''

   A book published earlier this year predicts
that a prelude to the end of the world will begin this week, with
millions of the faithful suddenly, silently called to Heaven and
global disasters following.
   The prospect increased attendance Sunday at some churches, the
book has been a best-seller and some people have even quit their
jobs in preparation for the End.
   ``The Lord is coming back. I'm looking at it about any time
now,'' Jerry McLamb, 37, of Coats, said Sunday. He and workers at
his automobile engine shop had rushed to complete customers' orders
last week.
   ``Will it happen? I'm not a date-setter ... but I'm not a fool,
either,'' said the Rev. Max Allman of Peoples Memorial Christian
Church in Burlington, who urged worshipers in a sermon Sunday to
``check out their priorities.''
   He said he knew of several people who had quit their jobs in
recent weeks or taken leaves of absence in preparation, and his
church attendance has doubled in recent weeks.
   ``This has made them understand that in a flash this could all
be over,'' he said.
   The excitement stems from a prediction made by Edgar C. Wisenant
in his book, ``88 Reasons Why The Rapture Will Be In 1988.''
   Wisenant, a former NASA rocket engineer, uses mathematical
calculations and biblical interpretation to pinpoint the beginning
of the end to the 48 hours of this year's Jewish New Year _ 40
years and 120 days after Israel became a nation on May 14, 1948.
The Jewish celebration runs from sunset Sunday to sunset Tuesday.
   ``That's when the fires and famines are supposed to begin,
plagues and sickness like AIDS,'' said Geneva Whitley, 66, of
Bentley. The plagues will end in November 1995, when Christ
returns, Wisenant says.
   Interest in the event has mushroomed so much that lately some
Christian bookstores have reported being unable to keep Wisenant's
book in stock.
   ``We've sold well over 1,000 since the second week in July,''
said Joanna Hicks, co-owner of the Sign Of The Fish bookstores in
the Raleigh area.
   Some stores received free shipments of the $2 paperback last
week from its publisher, the World Bible Society of Nashville,
Tenn., and were giving them away.
   ``I've spent over $200,000 personally in trying to get the word
out to the faithful,'' the Bible society's publisher, Norville
Olive, told The News and Observer of Raleigh.
   Barry Blinson of Wendell said he paid more than $1,000 for books
and for advertising time on a Christian radio station in Raleigh,
to warn people.
   But not everyone who believes in the return of Jesus Christ says
that his visit is at hand.
   ``I just don't feel that the Lord is ready to destroy the
earth,'' said Chris Avery, whose husband is pastor of the Hill
Street Baptist Church in Asheville.
   She said Missionary Baptist churches, like many mainstream
denominations, teach that Jesus will return and Christians will go
to Heaven, but ``we aren't looking for it like that.''
   Setting dates for the Second Coming of Christ began as early as
the 14th century, said Jim Megivern, chairman of the religion
department at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. He
called it ``calendarizing,'' or taking the Bible to its most
literal extremes by certain interpreters of biblical prophecy.
   James Efird, professor at Duke University's Divinity School,
said history has recorded numerous instances where people awaited
Christ's coming.
   In the early 1900s, he said, a group of Jehovah's Witnesses
dressed in white and stood on the Mount of Olives to greet him. And
around 1844, New York preacher William Miller gathered a group of
Adventists in white robes twice to await the end of the world.

   Between 60 percent and 70 percent of Pat Walsh's
body is covered with tattoos.
   ``I'm what you'd call a tattooed lady,'' said Ms. Walsh, 40, who
has a jungle panorama of parrots and waterfalls permanently etched
into her back.
   She was among several hundred tattooed men and women, their
admirers and the curious who met at Coney Island Saturday for the
Tattoo Festival.
   ``I've just completed my right leg, an underwater scene
consisting of jellyfish and many lush things from my hip right on
down to my foot,'' the auto-parts store worker from Clifton, N.J.,
said.
   The colorful drawings that now cover much of Ms. Walsh's body
began with one small tattoo six years ago and is now ``my
magnificent obsession,'' she said.
   Her tattoos fulfill a ``desire to make my skin more beautiful
than it was. I cover my skin with birds, flowers, beautiful things
to look at.''
   Shotsie Gorman, a tattoo artist from Haledon, N.J., said the
designs are ``an exciting way of expression.''
   ``Some people collect photos of tattoos, but it's much more
exciting to collect them on your body,'' he said. ``And it's
certainly much more of a commitment.''

   Puppies will be puppies, and puppies
like to swallow things. But $3.42? In small change?
   Baby, a 14-pound American bull terrier who had to have 10 ounces
of junk surgically removed from her stomach, swallowed seven
quarters, seven dimes, seven nickels and 62 pennies. She also
consumed four washers, a nail more than an inch long, a house key
on a key ring, a game token from a pizza parlor, a small piece of
electrical wire and some pellets from a shotgun shell.
   Kelli Brown noticed Baby was acting a little sluggish and took
her to Dr. Phillip L. Curry, who told her an X-ray of the dog's
stomach showed a ``huge blob.''
   Curry said that during the operation he and his staff ``just
kept hunting and we just kept finding things.''
   Curry said he has seen animals eat everything from small balls
and jacks to needles and as much as five pounds of rocks.
   ``It's not unusual to have them swallow things,'' Curry said.
``But this is unusual from the standpoint of the size of the dog
and the volume (consumed).''
   Baby was to go home Monday or Tuesday.

   William Shakespeare once suggested killing all the
lawyers as a way to rid society of squabbling and avarice.
   Lawyer Bill Berger and artist Ricardo Martinez have some rather
irreverent suggestions on how to dispose of the bodies.
   Their book, ``What to do With a Dead Lawyer'' is a compilation
of drawings offering various scenarios to that end.
   ``The legal profession is inclined to take itself too
seriously,'' said Berger. ``No one is above being satirized.
   ``I thought the idea of doing horrible things to lawyers was
quite funny,'' Berger said.
   ``The more we went along, it seems the nastier we became,''
added Martinez.
   The drawings include a shredded corporate lawyer as part of a
ticker-tape parade, a management lawyer who becomes a time-card
punch for hard-hat construction workers and a tobacco company's
lawyer who becomes an ashtray.
   ``It's good for someone like an attorney to poke fun at
themselves,'' said Berger, 39.
   Berger and Martinez have sold about 500 books so far.

   All the activity was in the stands at
the Brightwood Tavern's sixth annual slug races.
   The spectators were whipped into a frenzy. Trainers, owners and
fans yelled, screamed and booed. But the racers, well, you might
say they were sluggish.
   Slick, Slither and Sturgeon Lips were among the 55 contestants
in Saturday's race.
   They were weighed and measured, and then the action started. If
you could call it action.
   The slugs were placed in the center of a circle drawn on a large
board. At the end of two minutes, the winner was the one who has
traveled the farthest.
   The crowd roared when tavern owner Bob Swarts yelled, ``They're
off!''
   Nothing happened.
   The four slugs in the first race just sat there. Three looked as
if they were asleep. Sturgeon Lips looked bored.
   Finally, it squirmed a few times and waved its antennae around.
It moved a few inches and stopped.
   The winner was a slug named Dorsey III.

<HEAD>One of U.S. Marshals' `Most Wanted' Arrested In Belize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 72-year-old man who was one of the U.S.
Marshals Service's ``15 most wanted'' fugitives was arrested Sunday
in the Central American nation of Belize, the marshals said.
   William Moore Pegram had been wanted by the marshals since July
1986 for federal parole violation. He fled when he was released on
bond while appealing an April 1986 grand larceny conviction in
Brownsville, Tenn., for which he was sentenced to six years in
prison, the marshals said.
   At the time of the larceny conviction, he was on parole with 10
years of time remaining to be served from a conviction in Oxford,
Miss., for bank robbery, interstate transportation of stolen
firearms and assault on a federal officer, the marshals said in a
statement.
   Deputy U.S. marshals developed information several days ago
indicating that Pegram was hiding in Belize. He was located
Saturday and kept under surveillance until his arrest Sunday
afternoon by local police, the marshals said.
   Pegram then was taken into the custody of deputy marshals and
placed on a commercial airliner bound for Houston. He was to be
returned to the federal prison system to serve the balance of time
left on prior convictions.
   Pegram, originally from New Albany, Miss., recently was featured
on the television program ``America's Most Wanted.''
   His first felony conviction was for violation of Tennessee state
liquor laws in 1940. Other convictions have been for firearms
violations, violations of internal revenue laws, bank robbery and
conspiracy, burglary of a post office, assault on federal officers,
interstate transportation of stolen property and shooting with
intent to kill a police officer.

<HEAD>Snow Over Yellowstone, Yellowstone Smoke Over New York State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Light snow fell Sunday over the northern Rockies, remnants of
hurricane Florence produced more heavy rain in the South and
showers were scattered across the Plains and Southeast.
   Light snow fell over sections of Montana and western Wyoming,
with almost 2 inches of snow in Wyoming at Burgess Junction and the
northern part of Grand Teton National Park. An inch fell at Mammoth
Hot Springs, at the northern entrance of Yellowstone National Park.
   Smoke from the forest fires in and around Yellowstone has
gradually spread eastward and was over Pennsylvania and New York
state Sunday. It was carried by westerly wind at an altitude of
15,000 to 20,000 feet.
   The smoke gave a hazy appearance to the sky and may cause
colorful sunrises and sunsets, the National Weather Service said.
   The leftovers of Florence spread locally heavy rain across
Louisiana, with 1 to 3 inches over north-central and northeastern
sections of the state. The heaviest rainfall reported was 3.06
inches at Jonesboro, with 2.84 inches at Vixian.
   Other showers and thunderstorms developed along a cold front
over the eastern half of the Dakotas, southeastern Wyoming,
Colorado and New Mexico.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed over Florida, Georgia,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi and Arkansas.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.10 inches of rain fell
Tyndall Air Force Base at Panama City, Fla.
   Hurricane Gilbert was east of Jamaica with highest sustained
wind of 100 and was moving west across the Caribbean.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 30s and 40s over western
North Dakota and the northern Rockies.
   Astoria, Ore., had a record low of 37; Olympia, Wash., had a
record low of 34; and Corpus Christi, Texas, tied its record low of
67.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 30
degrees at Yellowstone National Park to 101 at Palm Springs, Calif.
Sunday morning's low was 22 degrees at Jackson, Wyo., south of
Yellowstone.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
over eastern sections of the lower and middle Mississippi Valley,
the Tennessee Valley and the lower Ohio Valley. Scattered showers
and a few thunderstorms were forecast ahead of and along a cold
front over the upper Great Lakes, southern sections of the upper
Mississippi Valley, South Dakota, Nebraska and sections of the
central and southern Rockies.
   Highs in the 50s were predicted over most of the northern Plains
and northern Rockies; in the 60s over sections of the northern and
central intermountain region between the Sierra Nevada and the
Rockies, from northeastern Colorado across central Nebraska to
northeastern Minnesota, and over northern New England; in the 90s
over Florida, the Gulf Coast region, the lower Mississippi Valley,
the southern Plains, eastern Kansas and the inland valleys of
California; near 100 over the desert Southwest; and in the 70s and
80s over the remainder of the country.

   About a dozen gang members held a man to
the ground as he was stabbed to death during a rap concert where at
least 13 people were either knifed or beaten, police said Sunday.
   Three of the stabbing victims were listed in critical condition.
   Deputy Police Chief Otto Geiger said investigators believe one
gang was responsible for much of the violence at the Nassau
Coliseum during Saturday night's ``Jam '88,'' which featured Eric
B. and Rakim, Kool Moe Dee and Doug E. Fresh.
   The killing was the latest in a series of violent incidents at
rap concerts around the nation, including two stabbings during a
Run-DMC concert at the Nassau Coliseum last month.
   Geiger said metal detectors were used at the door, and he did
not know how the knives were taken into the arena, where about 100
private security guards and 100 Nassau County police officers
patrolled the audience of about 10,000.
   ``Every precaution was taken to ensure the safety of those
persons attending the concert,'' said coliseum spokeswoman Hilary
Hartung. ``However, there seems to be a small element in society
that attends this type of concert solely for the purpose (of
creating) problems for those who come to enjoy the show. The Nassau
Coliseum will not condone this type of behavior and will thoroughly
investigate the future of rap concerts.''
   Julio Fuentes, 19, was stabbed in the heart when he refused to
relinquish the gold-plated chains he was wearing, Geiger said.
   He was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at the Nassau
County Medical Center in East Meadow.

   Palestinian activists stabbed and seriously
wounded an Arab physician Sunday and the army said attackers threw
acid in the faces of two other Arab doctors who allegedly
collaborated with Israeli authorities.
   Israeli officials voiced concern about the surge of attacks in
which four suspected collaborators were killed in the past week.
   ``We are monitoring the situation very carefully because in this
phase, Palestinian violence has increasingly turned against
Palestinians,'' said Col. Raanan Gissin, an army spokesman.
   Israelis prayed in synagogues and enjoyed picnics in celebration
of the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana, that began Sunday. Police and
military units were reinforced for the holiday as violence
continued in the nine-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   One of Haifa's chief rabbis, Shaar Yashuv Cohen, ruled that
worshipers can carry handguns into synagogues if they are
concealed, Israel radio reported.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in a message to the armed
forces, said the coming year ``did not promise peace and quiet.''
   Hospital officials said 13 Palestinians were wounded Sunday in
clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They
said eight were wounded by army gunfire in Gaza's Shati refugee
camp and the five others were wounded in and around the West Bank
city of Nablus.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In response to the latest attacks on Arabs suspected of
collaborating with Israel, six members of the Israeli-appointed
municipal council in the West Bank village of Yatta resigned,
saying they feared for their lives. The seventh council member,
Mayor Ismail Abu Hemeid, remained in his post.
   ``We saw what happened to people who didn't obey the orders of
the uprising leaders,'' council member Khalil Abu Sabha said. Two
weeks ago, a suspected collaborator was hacked to death in Yatta.
   The latest leaflet from the pro-PLO United National Leadership
of the Uprising called on Palestinians to ``rid ourselves of
collaborators and go after those who have not resigned from their
jobs with the Israeli government.''
   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud
Bloc called on Arab states to form a Palestinian negotiating team
not connected with the Palestine Liberation Organization for Middle
East peace talks.
   ``I think it's possible with the assistance of neighboring Arab
countries, which by a joint effort can succeed in establishing an
authorized and convincing (Palestinian) representation,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader, was
quoted by the daily Yediot Ahronot as saying the PLO probably would
win recognition from the United States if it renounced terror and
accepted Israel's right to exist.
   But he declined to specify if Israel would then talk to the PLO,
saying he was ``not ready to give an answer that would amount to
giving credibility.''
   In the northern West Bank town of Jenin, an assailant ambushed
the head of the local health department, Dr. Ahmed Nayef Istaiteh,
outside his office and stabbed him in the chest, stomach and right
arm, Jenin hospital officials said.
   Istaiteh, 45, was transferred to Afula Hospital in northern
Israel and was reported in serious condition. The attacker was
captured, Israel radio said.
   Istaiteh apparently was targeted because he worked for the West
Bank military government. He also carried a weapon, a sign that he
cooperated with Israeli authorities.
   In the Gaza Strip, masked assailants Saturday threw acid at two
Arab doctors from Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis and the victims
suffered eye and face injuries.
   Israel radio they were singled out for allegedly providing the
army with information about patients hurt in clashes with troops.
   A military official acknowledged that the army could not prevent
all attacks.
   ``We try to assist them as much as we can, but the
responsibility is theirs,'' said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Four suspected collaborators have been killed in the past week.
The latest fatality was reported Sunday by the Jerusalem Post,
which said the body of Issa Yasin, 30, a suspected collaborator,
was found in the village Anin near Jenin over the weekend.
   The other victims were a Moslem official from Jaffa who
reportedly sold land to Israelis, a member of an underground
``popular committee'' accused of being an informer and a
26-year-old man who allegedly cooperated with Israeli security.
   The latest fatalities brought to 264 the number of Palestinians
killed in the uprising. Most have been killed by Israeli gunfire,
but the figure includes those killed by Palestinians.
   Six Israelis, including Rachel Weiss, an elderly woman found
dead near her collective farm in the Negev Aug. 3, have also been
killed.

   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi came under
attack by opposition leaders Sunday and warned the parliament that
a vote of no-confidence in his new government will hamper Iran's
post-war recovery.
   ``For the sake of the country ... we must all try to be
flexible,'' said Musavi, addressing the 270-member Majlis, or
parliament, before it began discussing his 21-man Cabinet,
according to Tehran Radio.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said four members of the
opposition criticized the new government while five representatives
praised it.
   The official Islamic Republic news agency said the confidence
vote, set earlier for Sunday, would be postponed a day.
   The IRNA report said the Majlis will ``listen to remarks of the
government's representative in defense of the Cabinet ministers
before casting their votes for or against the Cabinet.''
   Divisions that have plagued the Iranian leadership for years
sharpened after Tehran's abrupt July 18 acceptance of the U.N.
Security Council's cease-fire resolution in the 8-year-old war with
Iraq. Iran agreed to the cease-fire after a string of military
defeats.
   Diplomatic sources said Musavi opposed the cease-fire, which
began Aug. 20. The acceptance was believed to have been
masterminded by Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the parliament and
Iran's military commander, the second most powerful figure in Iran
after Khomeini.
   The parliamentary debate Sunday was on the government Musavi
announced in July after parliamentary elections in April and May.
   IRNA said the debate focused on the ministries of the Interior,
the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, Agriculture, Labor and
Social Affairs as well as Post Telegraph and Telephones.
   The prime minister warned if his ministers do not win a vote of
confidence ``their offices will remain virtually vacant'' until
presidential elections scheduled for next year.
   Musavi, 46, submitted his resignation to President Ali Khamenei
on Monday, claiming that as many as eight of his ministers faced
no-confidence votes in parliament.
   He retracted his resignation Tuesday night after Khamenei
rejected it and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini publicly rebuked him
for making the surprise move at such a critical juncture while Iran
was negotiating a peace settlement with Iraq.
   Musavi, a radical who favors tight state control of the economy,
opposes bringing in foreign companies to help Iran rebuild. He has
warned that would drive Iran, its economy bled dry by the war, deep
into debt.
   He is opposed by Khamenei, who has close links with the merchant
class and conservative clerics, and Rafsanjani, the leading
advocate of ending Iran's isolation by improving links with the
West.
   Some Western economists estimate reconstruction will cost Iran
around $40 billion. Iran has foreign reserves estimated at $5
billion, but owes around 2 billion dollars.
   Iran, like Iraq, is expected to boost its oil production,
currently restricted by an Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, to pay its reconstruction bill. But that would drive oil
prices down.

<HEAD>Beard Defeats Woo, Begins Senate Race Against Roth</HEAD>

   With an upset primary victory behind him,
wealthy civic activist Samuel S. Beard began campaigning Sunday for
a U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent William V. Roth Jr.
   Beard, 49, was the underdog in a Democratic primary Saturday
that pitted him against heavily financed Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo, 51.
Roth did not have a primary opponent.
   Campaign finance reports filed in late August showed Woo having
raised $407,998, Beard with $65,008 and Roth with $734,933.
   Several small precincts did not plan to report voting results
until Monday, but with 97 percent of the vote counted, Beard had
22,418, or 53 percent, to Woo's 19,624, or 47 percent.
   A little over 30 percent of the 133,386 Democrats eligible to
vote turned out.
   New Castle County, which includes Wilmington, helped push Beard
over the top, as he won his home county with 17,001 to Woo's 13,296.
   Beard, who inherited his wealth, had the support of party
loyalists and unions. Woo, of Newark, was a champion of
Asian-Americans nationwide and had the support of the college set.
   Woo said in a statement after his electoral defeat, ``I always
said it was a tough way to earn a living,'' adding he looked
forward to returning to teaching physics at the University of
Delaware.
   The native of Shanghai, China, gave up the right to run for
re-election as lieutenant governor to make the run for the Senate.
   Beard said Saturday that his campaign for the November election
would begin Sunday morning.
   ``I'm going to start going out and thanking the people who
helped support this campaign and then start putting our plans
together for the fall,'' he said.
   Beard attributed his victory to a ``grassroots, issue-oriented
approach.'' Among issues he said voters agreed with him on was
foreign investment, which he said Woo ``was prepared to encourage.''
   ``I've spent all my life creating jobs here, building industry.
We need to increase our exports. I do not encourage foreign
investors purchasing our farms or our businesses,'' Beard said.
   ``We ran a campaign on broad issues. S.B. focused mostly on
technology,'' he said.
   Woo had contended that there was a need for scientists in the
Senate to be able to competently discuss issues dealing with
technology.
   In the final week of the campaign, it was disclosed that Woo's
ethnic background had become a target.
   A letter supporting Beard and written by Edward ``Pete''
Peterson, president of the Delaware AFL-CIO, called on supporters
to ``save this country ... from Asian influences the lieutenant
governor refers to'' as well as ``all foreign influence.''
   Peterson wrote another letter last week, apologizing to anyone
who might have been offended by the statement.
   Peterson said he was referring to Woo's claims of contacts with
many business leaders in Asia.

   Kurdish refugees at a camp near this
eastern city cited a litany of ailments they said they suffered
when the Iraqi army drove them from their villages with poison gas.
   ``My whole body itches, one of my eyes is blinded, I have
trouble breathing,'' Iskender Omer, 58, said Sunday.
   He said he and other refugees left the town of Zahor in northern
Iraq 20 days ago when Iraqi planes began dropping chemical bombs on
their village.
   ``They made very little noise, these bombs, a yellow smoke
emanated from them and a foul, garlic-like smell was in the air,''
he told The Associated Press from his bed in one the 500 tents set
up to house the refugees.
   Mustard gas is distinguishable by its garlic-like smell.
   He and his 30-year-old son Halil Iskender said many people from
their village died because they were closer to where the bombs
fell. The two said they saved themselved by throwing themselves
into an irrigation canal.
   The United States has accused Iraq of using chemical weapons
against its Kurdish minority. The U.S. Senate on Friday approved
economic sanctions against Iraq.
   Turkey, which has given sanctuary to about 60,000 Kurds fleeing
the Iraqi attacks, said Friday no evidence of chemical weapons use
was found in screening the sick and injured among the refugees.
   The Turkish government set up a clinic with 10 doctors and 25
nurses in the camp, which houses 8,000 refugees.
   Doctors say they have not determined that any of the deaths
among the refugees or the symptoms of illnesses among the refugees
were caused by poison gas.
   ``These people have been on the road for days, they suffer from
exhaustion and various infections, including eye infections,'' said
Dr. Sinan Seyfioglu.
   Seyfioglu believes their findings from the refugees neither
confirm or deny the use of chemical weapons.
   ``This does not mean Iraq did not use poison gas. But if these
people had been exposed, I don't believe they could make it over
here,'' he said.
   But Kurdish guerrillas in the camp near Diyarbakir said they
would still be in Iraq fighting if they did not have to escape from
chemical bomb attacks.
   They showed a 3{-year-old boy, Isa Ismail, and said scabs
covering his entire face are the result of poison gas.
   ``Where we come from, birds no longer fly, even the animals are
dead,'' said Cemal Salih, wearing the baggy brown pants which is
the uniform of the Peshmergas, the Kurdish guerrillas.
   ``We ran without burying our dead,'' he said. He said, along
with others, that he was willing to go back and show the dead
bodies to observers if it were possible.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen in a stolen taxi killed an opposition
mayoral candidate outside his house in a small town in Veracruz
state as his wife looked on, police said Sunday.
   Inocencio Romero Juarez, the Mexican Socialist Party mayoral
candidate in Tezonapa, died from four gunshot wounds at about 8
p.m. Saturday night, said Jazinto Licona, a Federal Judicial Police
supervisor in Veracruz.
   Licona said the candidate was standing at the door of his house,
talking to his wife, Maria Lucia, when shots were fired from a
passing taxi. He said Mrs. Romero Juarez told police several people
were in the cab.
   Tezonapa is a town of about 7,000 people about 50 miles from the
Gulf of Mexico port of Veracruz, the state capital 190 miles east
of Mexico City. Licona spoke in a telephone interview.
   Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, national leader of the Mexican
Socialist Party, told the liberal Mexico City daily La Jornada that
the shooting appeared to be politically motivated.
   His party belongs to a democratic reform coalition headed by
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who finished second in the July presidential
elections won by Carlos Salinas de Gortari of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI). Cardenas' coalition has targeted Oct. 2
municipal elections in Veracruz in their campaign to end the
governing party's 59-year domination of Mexican politics.
   Police rejected any political motive in Romero Juarez' death.
   ``Inocencio Romero Juarez was a person dedicated to business ..
. a tranquil person. This could not have been something
political,'' Francisco Torral, a state police spokesman in Veracruz
said in a telephone interview.
   Torral said the taxi was stolen shortly before the shooting of
Romero Juarez. Police had no exact age for Juarez, but said he was
45 or 46.
   The Cardenas movement maintains that six earlier shootings in
Mexico City, including the slaying of a Cardenas advisor a few days
before the July 6 presidential election, are political.
   Authorities have rejected politics as a motive in each case,
none of which has been solved.

   Thousands of leftists battled police
Sunday after an emotional memorial service to Marxist President
Salvador Allende, who perished in the military coup that overthrew
his government 15 years ago.
   An estimated 5,000 people paid homage at the modest tomb in a
cemetery in this coastal resort.
   When the service ended bands of militants marched out of the
cemetery and were confronted by ranks of helmeted riot police. The
police used tear gas, clubs and water cannons to disperse the
marchers.
   Several people were arrested and reporters saw a few
demonstrators injured, including a young man bleeding from the head
after being clubbed by two policemen. Officials did not give any
figures on the numbers of arrests or injured.
   It was the largest graveside tribute to Allende who was buried
in the suburban cemetery a day after his death during the Sept. 11,
1973, coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the army commander who
then became president.
   The regional government in Vina del Mar, 75 miles northwest of
Santiago, had authorized only a brief procession and when the
militants attemped to march on the city center the police blocked
them.
   According to the military government, Allende shot himself in
the head with a carbine that was a gift from Cuban President Fidel
Castro as the Presidential Palace was in flames and under attack by
troops. Allende had declared he would not allow himself to be
deposed and taken out of the palace alive, and the military version
is accepted by most Chileans and historians.
   But his followers said after the coup he was killed by police or
soldiers who shot their way into his office.
   The military government had barred the placing of a tombstone
with Allende's name at the grave, but on Sunday there was a small
marble plaque with the inscription: ``Salvador Allende Gossens,
June 26, 1908 _ September 11, 1973. President of Chile, 1970-1073.
Tribute of the Chilean Socialist Party.''
   Groups of people began arriving at the cemetery in midmorning,
many placing red and white carnations at the tomb. By noon, some
5,000 people had gathered and a carpet of carnations covered the
tomb.
   A man in his 20s stood beside the tomb for a few minutes and
then collapsed, sobbing. Many other mourners also wept.
   The crowd was quiet as loudspeakers broadcast a recording of
Allende's last speech on the day of the coup.
   ``You don't stop social processes with crime or by force,'' he
said, speaking through by telephone from the besieged palace to the
only Santiago radio station that not been taken over by the
military. Gunfire and explosions could be heard in the background.
   After the recording people in the crowd chanted, ``We can feel
it, we can feel it, Allende is here.''
   They also shouted, ``Pinochet is going to fall, the dictatorship
is going to fall.''
   Attending the service were a grandson of Allende, Gonzalo Meza,
and a niece, Denise Pascal. But Allende's daughter, Isabel, who
returned to Chile Sept. 1 when the government ended the official
exile of about 500 leftists, was not present. She had visited the
grave privately last week and on Saturday.

   Sixty-five demonstrators who formed a
human barricade to prevent women from entering an abortion clinic
face arraignment Monday on disorderly conduct charges, authorities
said Sunday.
   Nearly 60 of the demonstrators posted bond and were released,
but a few remained overnight in the Franklin County Jail after the
Saturday protest, sheriff's Lt. Sam Brobst said.
   The protesters said they came from Kentucky, Indiana and
Pennsylvania as well as Ohio to participate in the demonstration.
Bob Davis, who said he was the group's spokesman, said it was
called Project Rescue and was affiliated with the national
organization Operation Rescue, which has held demonstrations in New
York City, Philadelphia and Atlanta.
   The protesters sang Amazing Grace at the door of the Northwest
Women's Center on Saturday morning until 40 officers moved them as
clinic workers and patients waited outside.
   Jill Spangler, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League of Ohio, said, ``They are very organized. They
went with the intention of getting arrested. They knew what to do.
   ``They say they are civil rights people but they are trying to
deny the right of choice for women.''

   The stalled Iran-Iraq peace talks suffered another
setback Sunday after a meeting between the two foreign ministers
and the U.N. mediator.
   U.N. officials were known to be trying to reconvene the
ministers to move the talks along, but attempts to call a meeting
Sunday were abandoned by late evening. Consultations took place
throughout the day, U.N. spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said.
   Whether to shift the talks to New York appears to be the latest
obstacle to finding a permanent peace after a U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war began Aug. 20. The
United Nations and Iran are believed to favor the shift of venue
while Iraq has publicly opposed it.
   The U.N. mediator, Jan Eliasson, appeared to be waiting for
signs of compromise from either side. Efforts to break the deadlock
were due to continue Monday.
   On Saturday, the two foreign ministers met with Eliasson for 3{
hours in their first face-to-face talks since the second day of the
negotiations Aug. 26. The exchanges between the two parties has
otherwise been indirect.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar personally
mediated the first week of talks, then appointed Eliasson as his
representative.
   The negotiations have been stalled since the start after Iraq
demanded early discussion of free navigation and clearing of its
main sea outlet, the Shatt al-Arab waterway, and Iran refused.

   A huge mass of fans pressed to the
stage during a Michael Jackson concert Sunday, and more than 1,550
people were reported injured in the crush, authorities said.
   Most injuries were minor, but officials said 40 people required
hospital treatment.
   Mounted police and vanloads of uniformed officers in riot gear
were called to the Aintree horse racing track, where 125,000
attended the final concert of the singer's European tour, police
said.
   Police said about 22 people were arrested for disorderly conduct.
   First-aid workers said they treated an estimated 3,400 fans
during the concert for a variety of injuries.
   John Crook, St. John's Ambulance Brigade assistant commissioner,
said 1,550 of the casualties were treated after being crushed at
the front of the crowd near the stage because of the pressure of
people behind them. He said several of the casualties were people
who fainted in the crush.
   Crook said one of the 40 the fans requiring hospital treatment
suffered a suspected fractured spine.
   ``We are really surprised by the number of casualties but out of
an audience of 125,000 I suppose it isn't too bad,'' Crook said.
   At one point trouble flared outside the arena when youths
without tickets, which cost $27 each, tried to pull down fences to
get a view of the show. Reporters said they saw mounted police and
officers in riot gear hurry to the scene and arrest several youths.
   In another incident, youths pelted concert ushers with rocks.
   Earlier reports indicated that the concert crush was caused by
the youths trying to enter the concert area, but Crook said there
were no reported injuries when fans without tickets tried to enter
the concert arena.
   Terry Smith, managing director of co-promoters Radio City, said
the casualties seemed exagerrated.
   ``I think it has gone very well and the local council and the
police seem perfectly happy with it,'' he said.
   Local councilman Owen Brady said: ``I think it has gone
excellently and above our expectations.
   ``We would expect some problems with a 125,000 crowd and we are
very pleased with how it went. We look forward to the next concert
at Aintree, be it Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, or
anyone,'' Brady said.
   The rock superstar began his European tour May 23, in Rome. The
tour organizers say a total of 2,509,200 fans attended the concerts
in Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, West
Germany, France, England, Wales, Ireland, Spain and Belgium.

   Seven campers armed with four
shotguns, an automatic rifle and several handguns allegedly took
three people captive and forced them to dig a pit for a pig roast,
authorities said.
   The seven men were arrested by 14 officers from several law
enforcement agencies who crept up to the campsite in the mountains
north of here and surrounded it Saturday, said Undersheriff Donald
Christensen.
   There were no injuries.
   Seven people were charged with reckless endangerment, possession
of drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia.
   The suspects, whose names weren't released Sunday, possessed
substances believed to be hallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD,
Christensen said. He wouldn't say whether they were under the
influence of the drugs at the time of their arrest.
   The captives, whose names also weren't released, apparently
stumbled onto the campsite and didn't know their captors,
Christensen said.
   The hostages may have been taken as early as Friday evening. The
sheriff's office said it got a tip Saturday morning, and verified
it by flying over the area.
   Christensen said a dead pig was left at the site, but wasn't
roasted.

   An 11-year-old boy who was shot by a passing
motorist as he sat outside his home said Sunday he's afraid to go
outside again.
   ``I don't think I'm gonna go out on my steps,'' Sterling Garvin
said. ``The only time I'm gonna sit on my steps is if there's a lot
of people out there I know ... and I'm talking about a lot.''
   The boy was the latest victim in a string of stabbings and
shootings in the city that Boston police have blamed, in part, on
an increase in street gangs, dozens of which they say are
trafficking drugs and guns.
   The Aug. 19 death of Tiffany Moore, 11, who police said was
sitting on a corner mailbox talking with friends when she was
caught in a cross-fire of rival drug dealers, galvanized Roxbury
residents, who called for an increased police presence in their
neighborhood.
   Sterling also lives in Roxbury, a predominantly black,
low-income section of Boston with about 50,000 residents.
   Sterling and two friends were talking after dinner Thursday when
a red car with tinted windows pulled up to the curb and fired a
single gunshot.
   ``I heard somebody say `Wow!' Then I see a hole in my pants,''
Sterling said. But he said he only felt a pinch and didn't believe
he had been shot.
   ``I kept saying, `I didn't get shot' 'cause it didn't hurt,'' he
said.
   He was taken to Boston City Hospital, where doctors bandaged his
left thigh but decided to not remove the .22-caliber bullet.
   ``They ain't gonna take it out 'cause if they did take it out
it'd damage my leg,'' Sterling explained as he rested on his
mother's bed, fingering the hospital bracelet he still wears.
   Sterling's mother, Jean, wants to remove the threat of violence.
After living in the same four rooms for six years, the Garvin
family is looking for a new home.
   ``It's been the worst time of my life,'' said Mrs. Garvin, who
emigrated from Trinidad 14 years ago. ``We had a fire above us a
few months ago and my son got shot, so I think it's time to move
out.''
   His mother and several cousins said they believed he was either
shot randomly or was mistaken for someone else.
   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn went to Sterling's hospital room and
spoke with the boy and his mother on the night Sterling was shot.
   ``He's 11 years old, Tiffany Moore was 11 years old and I have a
daughter who's 11 years old. It really has to break your heart,''
Flynn said.

   From remote ocean outposts to an African rally for
Pope John Paul II, the world put on its running shoes Sunday to
raise money for starving children in the second annual Sport Aid
``Race Against Time.''
   Reports indicated up to 50 million people worldwide took part in
the series of six-mile marathons that organizers called ``a
petition of blistered feet.'' It has been billed as the largest
participation event in history.
   ``This is the people's Olympics, when everybody around the world
can be a champion,'' said race spokesman Nick Cater. ``For many,
this is as near as they're ever going to make it to saving lives.''
   He said it may be weeks before Sport Aid knows how much money
was raised.
   The race began at dawn local time Monday in the South Pacific
island of Tonga _ ``the land where time begins'' _ and continued
Sunday as the sun set over the Great Pyramids in Egypt, Cater said.
   Police riding camels supervised the race near Cairo where about
8,000 men, women and children ran a course past the 4,500-year-old
Sphinx and the pyramids.
   Balloons and fireworks marked the start of the run by some
50,000 people in London's Hyde Park.
   In the United States, official races took place in 15 major
cities. The first Sport Aid race flopped in the United States
because it coincided with a nationwide ``Hands Across America''
campaign to raise funds for the poor and homeless.
   Young and old donned ``I Changed The World'' T-shirts Sunday in
an enlarged rerun of Sport Aid, which on May 25, 1986, attracted
nearly 20 million runners in 89 countries and raised $35 million
for African famine victims.
   In New York, about 220 boys and girls from more than 100
participating nations jogged up New York's First Avenue to the
United Nations headquarters with Sudanese athlete Omar Khalifa, who
lighted an Olympic-style flame to start the race.
   In Harare, Zimbabwe, the pope sent off dozens of young runners
with words of advice during a rally at Glamis Stadium. The pope
arrived in Zimbabwe Saturday to start a five-nation, 10-day tour of
southern Africa.
   ``Continue always to live in the love of God and to love one
another from the heart. Then the race against time shall be for our
world not only a race against hunger and disease but also a race
for goodness and right, a race of love that gives us all new hope
and joy,'' the pope said.
   Broadcast live in six languages to a potential audience of 1.5
billion people, with satellite TV and radio link-ups to 23 cities,
Sport Aid raised money from sponsors of runners, from ticket sales
to races and from sideline events for charities in mainly
underdeveloped nations.
   One-fifth of the funds raised in each developed country will go
to poor and disabled children in that country. The rest goes to
Third World countries.
   The United Nations Children's Fund estimates nearly 15 million
children die each year from hunger and easily preventable diseases.
   Two Soviet cosmonauts orbiting the Earth in the Mir space
station broadcast a message of support, and six hours of TV
coverage worldwide included excerpts of carnivals and concerts from
Trinidad to Dubai and Rio de Janeiro.
   All 58 residents of Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific pledged
to run, as did 2 million people in China.
   Other fund-raising events included a cross-country ski by
British marines in the South Atlantic island of South Georgia, and
ship-deck runs by passengers on the ocean liner Canberra in the
Mediterranean and by oil workers on tankers in the Gulf of Oman.
   Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed lit a flame in a
Kuala Lumpur field to begin a relay race by government ministers.
At dusk, a dozen free-fall army parachutists heralded the start of
the race in Oman by descending into Muscat's Sultan Qaboos Stadium.
   In Bahrain, about 600 people coursed mainly through desert,
starting an hour earlier in 100-degree Fahrenheit temperatures to
finish before nightfall.
   Sudan organized a run alongside the flood-swollen Nile River in
Khartoum, but Bangladesh, also devastated by floods, postponed its
race at least until next month, organizers said.

<HEAD>Alan Ladd Jr. Resigns as Chairman of MGM Pictures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alan Ladd Jr., who nurtured the hit
films ``Moonstruck'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' has resigned as
chairman and chief executive officer of MGM Pictures Inc., the
studio announced Sunday.
   Ladd, 50, a former president of 20th Century Fox and president
of The Ladd Co., also resigned as director of MGM-UA Communications
Co.
   ``Over the past few months, I had received inquiries from third
parties regarding other opportunities; I felt that it was
inappropriate for me to consider these while still affiliated with
MGM,'' Ladd said in a studio-prepared statement. ``Recently, I made
the decision to pursue other interests.''
   The statement did not disclose details of the opportunities.
   Ladd said the recent releases ``Moonstruck,'' which won Academy
Awards for actresses Cher and Olympia Dukakis, ``Willow,'' and ``A
Fish Called Wanda'' leave MGM ``in the best shape its has been in
the past several years.''
   The company also recently released ``Betrayed,'' a film about
white supremacy in America's heartland.
   MGM-UA Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen D. Silbert
said Ladd was responsible for numerous successful projects.
   ``We regret his departure,'' Silbert said.
   While at 20th Century Fox, Ladd, son of the late actor Alan
Ladd, was responsible for such hits as ``Star Wars'' and ``The
Omen.'' Among his other successes are ``Chariots of Fire'' and
``Police Academy.''
   Ladd's resignation follows that of MGM-UA Communications Co.
Chairman Lee Rich in July. Earler this month, Rich and Warner Bros.
announced a long-term agreement to produce movie and television
projects.
   A plan earlier this summer to split MGM-UA Communications into
two separate companies collapsed as financiers Kirk Kerkorian and
Burt Sugarman announced they were unable to agree on details of the
$400 million deal.
   MGM-UA reported in July the company lost $8.3 million or 16
cents a share in its third quarter, an improvement over the loss of
$27.5 million, or 55 cents a share in the comparable period a year
earlier. Revenue for the quarter ended May 31 was $175.2 million,
up from $72.4 million a year earlier.

   Tens of thousands of Iraqis paraded past
the U.S. Embassy on Sunday to denounce a U.S. Senate call for
sanctions in response to Iraq's alleged use of poison gas against
Kurdish rebels.
   ``U.S.A., Shame, Shame,'' the protesters chanted in English as
they marched past the embassy. Members of the ruling Arab Baath
Socialist Party exhorted them through loudspeakers.
   ``We will never forget U.S. evil,'' read one banner. ``No to
intervention in our affairs,'' read another in both Arabic and
English.
   ``Down with the U.S. Knesset,'' said another banner, referring
to close U.S. ties with Israel, whose parliament is called the
Knesset.
   About 20,000 marchers filed past the embassy for two hours.
   The crowd was orderly, even cheerful, and there was no apparent
threat to the embassy. One ranking U.S. diplomat stood on the
sidewalk a few feet from the march and watched it move by.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in a statement Sunday that
the U.S. Senate ``aims to divert the attention of the international
media from the uprising in the occupied territories.''
   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip have been rioting
against Israel's military occupation for the past nine months.
   Saddam said the fighting with the Kurdish ``insurgents'' lasted
at most two days and no serious battles were involved. He
reiterated the charge that the tens of thousand of Kurds who fled
across the Iraqi border to Turkey and Iran were forced by Kurdish
rebels, who were seeking publicity for their cause.
   Kurdish rebels said that as many as 60,000 Iraqi troops attacked
their positions in the northern mountains after the Aug. 20
cease-fire with Iran in the eight-year gulf war. The rebels of the
Kurdish Democratic Party said 2,000 Kurdish civilians were killed
and 5,000 wounded, many in chemical weapon attacks.
   The U.S. Senate voted Friday to demand economic sanctions
against Iraq after Secretary of State George Shultz declared that
Iraq used chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925 Geneva treaty,
against its northern Kurdish population.
   The measure, still before the House, would have to be signed by
President Reagan before taking effect. It was designed to make it
difficult for Iraq to obtain international credit to pay off its
estimated $60 billion war debt.
   Well before the latest Iraqi assault on the Kurds, a number of
United Nations investigations concluded that Iraq _ and to a lesser
extent, Iran _ had engaged in chemical warfare since 1984.
   ``Let the American Knesset and its masters understand that Iraq
is not a country that can be subject to threats. Iraq, which seeks
sincere and honorable relations with all, is ready to spit on all
insincere approaches,'' said an editorial in Al-Thawra, urging
Iraqis to take to the streets.
   It was not signed, but it carried the tag line often used by
President Saddam Hussein himself: ``To hell with the villains.''
   The army newspaper Al-Qadissiyeh denounced the Senate vote with
banner headlines.
   The attacks were the strongest on the United States since the
two countries restored relations in 1984. They were severed after
the United States supported Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Hussein also said Sunday he turned down an offer by unidentified
people in Washington to trade 100 U.S.-made artillery pieces for an
advanced Soviet tank Iraq had during the war.
   In a speech broadcast on state-run television, the president did
not specify who offered the 175mm guns for the T-72 tank but said
his intelligence chief conducted negotiations for them in
Washington. He hinted the talks took place in 1982 after some
countries banned arms sales to Iraq.
   The United States banned arms sales to both sides during the
war, although administration officials violated that policy by
selling arms to Iran in an effort to improve relations and free
American hostages held in Lebanon.
   In a related development, the Iraqi News Agency reported that
11,517 Kurds accepted the Iraqi government's offer of amnesty for
supporting Iran in the Persian Gulf war and any other actions
against the government.
   The report, quoting unidentified officials, said Kurds were
``pouring through the gates of the borders.''
   Newspapers in neighboring Kuwait also attacked the Senate vote.
Editorials in pro-government papers said the U.S. campaign was
inspired by the ``Zionist lobby'' in the United States.
   The Kuwaiti papers said Arab states could replace any funding
denied through international institutions because of a U.S. veto.

<HEAD>Detroit's Child Homicide Rate Nation's Worst</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children under 17 were more than twice as likely
to die violently in Detroit than in other major U.S. cities in
recent years, according to a study.
   Detroit's juvenile homicide rate jumped to more than three times
the overall rate in the nation's 10 largest cities by 1986,
according to a study commissioned by the Detroit Free Press.
   Guns alone have accounted for 37 deaths of Detroit youths so far
this year, compared with 35 fatal shootings for all of 1987.
   Drugs, crumbling families and inattention to children drew much
of the blame for the juvenile homicide rate in the nation's
sixth-largest city, which declined in only one year between 1979
and 1986.
   ``We don't love our children enough,'' said Dr. Rosalind
Griffin, a Detroit psychiatrist. ``With a homicide rate like this,
it can be said that we don't cherish or think of them as the
future.''
   The Free Press, citing a computer study it commissioned of FBI
crime statistics from 1979 through 1986 and related research, said
Detroit's juvenile homicide rate during that period was 2.7 per
100,000 residents.
   Chicago was second at 1.9 per 100,000, followed by Los Angeles
with 1.6 per 100,000. The overall rate for the nation's 10 largest
cities was 1.3 per 100,000.
   Detroit's juvenile homicide rate reached 4.1 per 100,000 in
1986, the latest year for which figures were available. That rate
was more than three times the 1986 rate in the 10 largest U.S.
cities, 1.3 per 100,000.
   Detroit also had the highest overall homicide rate, 47 per
100,000 residents, among the 10 largest cities in 1979-86. Dallas
was a distant second with 31.7 murders per 100,000, the newspaper
said.

   A man who on Sunday became the 14th fatality of
the Delta Flight 1141 wreck died of injuries sustained when he
returned to the airplane in a futile attempt to save his wife,
friends said.
   Edmond Fadal, 64, of Waco died early Sunday at Parkland Memorial
Hospital, where he had been listed in critical condition since the
Aug. 31 crash of the Boeing 727 at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.
   His wife Marian, 65, died in the crash along with 12 others.
Ninety-four passengers and crew members survived the accident.
   Jean and Frank Nix, also of Waco, had joined the Fadals on the
Delta flight for a trip to Lake Tahoe.
   Mrs. Nix, 54, told The Associated Press Sunday that three of
them escaped from the jet wreckage without severe injuries, but
Fadal returned to the plane for his wife.
   ``The plane broke open right in front of us,'' Mrs. Nix
recalled. ``We all unbuckled our seat belts and tried to run out.
... We never looked back.''
   But when the Nixes and Edmond Fadal noticed Marian Fadal was not
with them, Fadal ran back to the wreckage, they said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Men armed with guns and machetes
burst into the church of a militant Roman Catholic priest Sunday
and killed at least three parishioners, wounded 60 and burned down
the building, witnesses and news reports said.
   Police stood near the church but none came to the rescue,
witnesses said. After the attack, gangs of men roamed the deserted
streets and stoned the offices of two groups opposed to the
military regime of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, an outspoken opponent of the
military government, had just begun a 9 a.m. (9 a.m. EDT) Mass when
a group of men began throwing rocks at the church, panicking
hundreds inside who rushed for the doors, said a foreign journalist
attending the service.
   ``Suddenly the doors at the back of the church burst open and 20
to 30 men with machetes, huge sticks and guns came in. They were
dressed in civilian clothes,'' said the journalist, who contacted
The Associated Press in New York by telephone.
   ``They started shooting people, beating them, and stabbing and
slashing them,'' the reporter said. ``They stabbed a woman who was
pregnant. They stabbed another man who ran outside the church. He
died. Some people were shot.''
   Estimates of the numbers of parishioners in the church, inside a
compound ringed by a wall, ranged from 600 to 1,500.
   Frightened residents fled to their homes after the attacks and
only the bands of men remained on the streets. The attack came on a
day when opposition groups had planned a a protest of Namphy's
voiding of the constitution in July.
   A Crusade for the Constitution Committee, headed by the
political opposition, had urged Haitians to dress in white Sunday
in a show of protest. Few people could be seen wearing white in the
city, however.
   Paul Latortue, a former senate candidate in Haiti, said he was
sure the church attack was the work of the government and its
supporters.
   ``They've wanted to kill Aristide for a long time,'' he said in
San Juan, where he teaches economics at the University of Puerto
Rico. ``It is significant that the government tried to do this
today, a day of protest.''
   The journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at
least three parishioners were killed. Parishioners surrounded and
protected Aristide, who was uninjured.
   Radio Haiti-Inter reported 60 people suffering from gunshot
wounds and machete slashes were being treated at the public general
hospital.
   Dr. Roger Valme, assistant director of the hospital where bodies
are normally taken, refused comment on the casualties.
   One witness said ``I saw a pregnant woman with a bullet hole in
her belly.''
   Firefighters responded around 10 a.m., but the fire gutted the
modest cement-block church and the roof collapsed before the blaze
was extinguished.
   Radio-Inter reported the attackers were dressed in civilian
clothes and wearing red armbands.
   Bands of men roamed the streets of the city after the attack,
and shortly after 3 p.m. stoned the headquarters of two opposition
political parties and Radio Cacique, a populist and outspoken
station.
   The unidentified men attacked the headquarters of Louis Dejoie's
National Agriculture and Industry Party and of Sylvio Claude's
Christian Democratic Party.
   Aristide is one of the most popular opposition leaders in Haiti.
There have been several attempts on his life blamed on forces loyal
to the government.
   Namphy returned to power in a coup June 19 after four months of
civilian rule under President Leslie Manigat. Namphy ruled for two
years as head of a junta after Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile
in France on Feb. 7, 1986.
   The journalist said she was told that many more than three
people were killed inside the church, but the bodies couldn't be
removed before the attackers set the building on fire and torched
cars parked out in front.
   ``One parishioner grabbed me and used me as a shield,'' she
said. ``I had to hit him to release me because I couldn't get out
of the church. I tried to run down the main aisle and that's when I
ran into one of the thugs with a knife.
   ``He grabbed me and ripped my dress, but I got away.''
   The church has a main back door, where the gunmen rushed in, and
two smaller side doors, she said.
   ``People fled from side doors in the crush,'' the journalist
said. ``There was a terrible panic and stampede.
   ``Parishioners tried to climb over the walls into the street,
but men with batons stopped them. The men then surrounded the
church building and set it on fire.''
   She said no one came to the rescue during the attack, despite
the presence of a military compound across the street. Soldiers
standing outside the church compound watched, but did not help, she
said.

   Police are using the fight against gang
violence to legitimize abuse of people's civil rights, an NAACP
official said.
   ``Under the guise of the gang crisis in our community, innocent
people are being harassed and rights are being infringed upon. We
are desperate to correct that,'' said Anthony Essex, local chapter
president of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   Essex spoke Saturday at an NAACP-sponsored hearing on
allegations of police misconduct.
   ``We shouldn't have to be concerned about the fact that when we
call for protection, we have to be subjected to the same
degradation inflicted on common criminals,'' Essex said.
   Alicia Jones, one of a half-dozen people who spoke at the
hearing, said she found herself on the floor with a gun pointed at
her head one night when she answered a knock at her door.
   She was held down by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy while
six other officers searched her apartment for cocaine, she said.
When no drugs were found and she had been questioned, she said, the
deputies realized the vehicles they had been watching actually
belonged to someone next door.
   ``I just couldn't believe this was happening to me. I felt as if
I was watching this happen to someone else,'' she said. ``I don't
bother anybody. I don't use drugs or associate with people who do.
I don't even like to drink.''
   Cmdr. William Booth, spokesman for the Police Department, said
the police have support from the general community.
   ``It wasn't that long ago that the community was demanding more
police officers to do something about rising gang violence,'' he
said. ``And the community is safer than it was before we started
saturating the community with police officers.''

National Agriculture and Industry Party and of Sylvio Claude's
Christian Democratic Party.
   Aristide is one of the most popular opposition leaders in Haiti.
There have been several attempts on his life blamed on forces loyal
to the government.
   Namphy returned to power in a coup June 19 after four months of
civilian rule under President Leslie Manigat. Namphy ruled for two
years as head of a junta after Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile
in France on Feb. 7, 1986.
   The journalist said she was told that many more than three
people were killed inside the church, but the bodies couldn't be
removed before the attackers set the building on fire and torched
cars parked out in front.
   ``One parishioner grabbed me and used me as a shield,'' she
said. ``I had to hit him to release me because I couldn't get out
of the church. I tried to run down the main aisle and that's when I
ran into one of the thugs with a knife.
   ``He grabbed me and ripped my dress, but I got away.''
   The church has a main back door, where the gunmen rushed in, and
two smaller side doors, she said.
   ``People fled from side doors in the crush,'' the journalist
said. ``There was a terrible panic and stampede.
   ``Parishioners tried to climb over the walls into the street,
but men with batons stopped them. The men then surrounded the
church building and set it on fire.''
   She said no one came to the rescue during the attack, despite
the presence of a military compound across the street. Soldiers
standing outside the church compound watched, but did not help, she
said.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
turned 71 Sunday, and was feted by supporters at a birthday bash
that drew about 5,000 people.
   Marcos, who has lived in exile here since February 1986, was
greeted by cheers and choruses of ``Happy Birthday to You ... Happy
birthday, Mr. President,'' when he and his wife, Imelda, arrives at
the ``Philippine Day in the USA,'' celebration.
   Supporters waved signs, one bearing Marcos' face and another
showing Marcos shaking hands with President Reagan. The Marcoses
sat on stage and were serenaded with traditional Filipino and
contemporary songs.
   The all-day event at Blaisdell Center Arena was sponsored by the
local group ``Friends of Marcos.'' Joe Lazo, the group's president,
said admission was free and open to the public.
   The celebration included food, entertainment and door prizes,
including a new car.
   ``Everyone had so much fun last year we decided to do it
again,'' Lazo said.
   Last year's celebration was billed as a non-political ``Prayer
for Peace for the Philippines.'' But the 6,000 supporters urged
Marcos to try to regain power from Philippine President Corazon
Aquino. Mrs. Marcos presented her husband with a gift of Philippine
soil, calling it, ``our only hidden wealth.''
   Several criminal and civil lawsuits filed by Marcos opponents in
the Philippines and the United States accuse the ousted leader of
plundering billions of dollars from his country during his 20-year
rule, and stashing it in hard-to-trace assets.
   Marcos has suffered from an ailment and was hospitalized with
chest pains several months ago, but a spokesman says he is now
feeling fine, and was cheered by one early birthday gift: a
$150,000, armor-plated, bullet-proof Mercedes Benz 450 SEL
delivered for his use by some mainland friends.
   The Marcoses traveled to the party, however, in a brown station
wagon.
   Meanwhile, Marcos supporters in the Philippines celebrated his
birthday Sunday in a rally in Manila and with a giant 33-by-82-foot
birthday cake in Laoag, the capital of Marcos' home province of
Ilocos Norte.

   A man who lost his father and sister in
a fire 18 years ago risked his life to pull a teen-ager from a car
that had crashed into a telephone pole and burst into flames.
   Ernest Furtado Jr., 23, early Saturday pulled Scott Medeiros,
19, from the burning wreckage just as police reached the scene.
   ``The kid in the car would have burned to death if not for this
other guy. There's no question in my mind,'' said police Sgt. Gary
Souza.
   Medeiros was listed in satisfactory condition at a hospital
where he was treated for head injuries.
   Furtado's father and 4-year-old sister died when fire swept
through their home in 1970. Furtado, his pregnant mother and two
other siblings escaped.
   The tragedy brought an outpouring of support from throughout
Fairhaven. A Furtado Family Fund was established and eventually
drew some $20,000 in donations.
   Furtado could not be reached for comment Sunday night. His phone
number is unlisted.

   A U.S. Army helicopter
struck high tension wires and crashed into a field, injuring the
two pilots and four soldiers on the ground, the military said
Sunday.
   The 5th Corps headquarters in Schwaebisch Hall said the
helicopter crashed Saturday afternoon near Bad Mergentheim, 95
miles southeast of Frankfurt.
   The pilots, from the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment stationed at
Fort Bliss, Texas, were seriously injured, a 5th Corps statement
said.
   Fort Bliss spokesman Brad Rose identified the pilots as Capt.
Carl Stephen Filip of El Paso, Texas, and 1st Lt. Kenneth Johnson.
He said he did not know Johnson's hometown but the lieutenant is a
member of an Ohio ational Guard Unit attached to the 3d Armored
Cavalry. Rose said Filip is assigned to the 3rd Armored Cavalry.
   Four U.S. soldiers on the ground were injured when they tried to
rescue the pilots from the wreckage, the statment said. The four
men suffered minor burns from power lines that were dragged down by
the helicopter, according to the statement.
   The helicopter, a Bell OH-58, was taking part in military
maneuvers.

   Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica
on Sunday with 100 mph winds and officials issued warnings to
residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti
and Cuba.
   The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal
flooding in Puerto Rico. In the Dominican Republic all domestic
flights and flights to and from Puerto Rico and Miami were canceled.
   Heavy rain and winds lashed the southern zone of the Dominican
Republic Sunday night as the hurricane passed south of the Barahona
peninsula, officials reported.
   Eugenio Cabral, director of the Dominican Civil Defense, said
there was some flooding in parts of the capital of Santo Domingo
and power outages there and other southern areas but no casualties
had been reported.
   Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga alerted all government
agencies and told a news conference Sunday night: ``Hurricane
Gilbert appears to be a real threat and everyone should follow the
instructions and hurricane precautions issued by the Office of
Disaster Preparedness in order to minimize the danger.''
   Jamaica's National Meteorological Service said if the hurricane
continues on its current course effects of the storm would be felt
in Jamaica by 6 a.m. EDT Monday.
   Ferry service across Kingston Harbor was suspended and
commercial flights were canceled.
   Outgoing flights from Jamaica's international airports at
Kingston and Montego Bay were being rescheduled but incoming
flights continued to arrive Sunday, officials reported.
   Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency reported a state of
alert was declared at midday in the western Cuban provinces of
Guantanamo, Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Granma.
   In the report from Havana received in Mexico City, Prensa Latina
said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on
national radio and television recommending emergency measures and
providing information on the storm.
   Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed
over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic
and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean island
they share, and headed west.
   ``It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the
Caribbean for a long time,'' said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami said that at 9 p.m.
the hurricane's center was near 16.8 north latitude and and 72.2
west longitude or about 310 miles east of Kingston, It said the
storm was moving just north of due west at 15 mph and it was
expected to continue that motion for the the next 24 hours.
   Maximum sustained winds were near 100 mph, the report said, with
tropical-storm force winds extending up to 250 miles to the north
and 100 miles to the south.
   The hurricane center said small craft in the Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico should remain in port until winds and seas subside.
   Forecasters said the hurricane's track would take it about 50
miles south of southwestern Haiti.
   ``The track looks like it will go right over Jamaica, but we
can't say for certain yet,'' Gerrish said.
   The forecasters said the Dominican Republic would receive 5 to
10 inches of rain on Sunday, with similar amounts falling in Haiti
Sunday night and Monday.
   In Santo Domingo, the Civil Defense alerted the nation's heavily
populated southern coast to prepare for high winds, heavy rains and
high seas.
   Civil Defense Director Eugenio Cabral said residents of the
Barahona peninsula should closely follow Gilbert's movement. An
estimated 100,000 people live in the area, including 70,000 in the
city of Barahona, 125 miles west of Santo Domingo.
   Antonio Cocco Quezada, director of the Dominican Weather
Service, said that if the hurricane changes course and starts
moving north it would put the south in ``grave danger.''
   Hurricane warnings also were issued for the south coast of Haiti
and Cuba by their respective governments.
   Jamaica's Ministry of Health said that hospitals throughout the
island were discharging all patients who could leave on their own
and only keeping the critically ill.
   The hospitals also were stocking up on emergency supplies of
medicine, blankets, water and food.
   Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and
strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.
   ``The hurricane passed about 100 miles south of the southwest
coast of Puerto Rico'' on Saturday night, Gerrish said. ``They got
pretty heavy rain.''
   In Puerto Rico, the storm left several homes without roofs,
caused coastal flooding and downed power lines and trees along
roads and highways in the west and southwestern regions.
   Four policemen stationed on Mona Island, between Puerto Rico and
the Dominican Republic, were stranded as a result of the poor
weather conditions.
   ``We are in constant contact with them by radio and they are in
good condition,'' said a police official in Mayaguez in western
Puerto Rico.
   Three people were injured in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, when a
tree fell on top of their vehicle as they traveled along Route 97
shortly after midnight Saturday, police reported.

collecting the data.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Frederic V. Malek, George Bush's recent choice
as deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee, resigned
Sunday on the heels of a report that he compiled figures on the
number of Jews in the Bureau of Labor Statistics under orders from
then-President Richard Nixon.
   Malek announced his resignation in a statement in which he did
not deny compiling the figures, but did deny he was responsible for
the demotion of any officials in the department. He said he didn't
want the campaign to be distracted by the controversy.
   Malek had acknowledged to The Washington Post that he had
compiled the figures.
   Malek had been picked by Bush to manage the Republican National
Convention in August. He later moved to the deputy chair's slot
with day-to-day responsibility for the party's fall campaign. His
resignation was effective immediately.
   Bush issued a simultaneous statement, saying, ``Fred Malek made
this decision to step aside because he did not want this campaign
to be caught up in allegations about something that happened many
years ago and that some might try to use against me.''
   The Post reported Sunday that former President Nixon had ordered
Malek in 1971 to investigate what was described in notes as a
``Jewish cabal'' at the agency.
   At the time, Malek was Nixon's White House personnel chief and
had been assigned to evaluate the BLS staff because Nixon thought
the bureau was interpreting unemployment data in an unfavorable
light.
   On July 27, 1971, Malek reported to H.R. ``Bob'' Haldeman,
Nixon's chief of staff, that 13 of 35 top BLS officials were
Jewish. Post reporters found the memo last week in the archives of
Nixon's presidency.
   Less than two months after Malek's memo to Haldeman, two senior
officials who were Jewish were ousted from their posts and moved to
less visible positions in the Labor Department. They were Peter
Henle, then chief economist for BLS, and Harold Goldstein, then
director of current employment analysis.
   Malek said in his statement: ``This is an extremely difficult
decision for me because of my instincts to stay on and defend
myself against these false and outrageous charges. However, my
desire to see the campaign continue to focus on the issues, and my
strong and unwavering support for the vice president, have moved me
to take this action.''
   Bush said of Malek, ``I know him to be a most honorable man
without a trace of bigotry in his makeup.''
   Malek, who graduated from Harvard Business School and became a
millionaire before age 30, came to Washington with the Nixon
administration. He recently worked as a senior executive for the
Marriott Corp.
   The Bush campaign was criticized last week because of
revelations in the weekly Washington Jewish Week newspaper that
several members of an ethnic advisory panel for the Bush campaign
had links with anti-Semitic or fascist organizations.
   One of them, Jerome Brentar, resigned as co-chairman of the Bush
'88 Coalition of American Nationalities, for his active defense of
retired Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, convicted in Israel as a
Nazi war criminal.

<HEAD>Strikes Cutting Into School Time In Six States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 students in six states were expected to have
classes disrupted Monday by strikes involving more than 6,100
teachers in 23 districts.
   In Peabody, Mass., school officials and representatives of 400
striking teachers were back at the bargaining table Sunday trying
to keep public school classes from being canceled a fourth day.
   The state Labor Relations Commission has outlawed the strike,
and school officials have mailed letters threatening to fire the
teachers after a hearing procedure, said Mayor Peter Torigan.
   A spokeswoman for the teachers dismissed the notices as a
pressure tactic and said the strike would continue.
   Pay is at the heart of the Peabody dispute, and many of the
others in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   In Peabody, teachers are seeking a three-year contract with a 9
percent pay increase each year. David Whitmore, a spokesman for the
Peabody Federation of Teachers, said the town proposed a 5.5
percent increase for each of the next three years.
   The Peabody strike affects about 5,700 students. A strike in
Illinois' Granite City district is disrupting classes for about
8,200 students. Michigan and Pennsylvania each have strikes in 9
districts, involving more than 40,000 students in each state.
Strikes in Ohio affect about 4,250 students and in New Jersey about
1,450 students.

   Buffalo graze
nonchalantly near flaming trees, but people are not reacting so
coolly, and residents once worried about losing business to forest
fires now fear losing their homes.
   Fire has destroyed buildings around the Old Faithful geyser and
has threatened tourist towns on the periphery of the country's
first national park.
   The Montana towns of Cooke City and Silver Gate outside the
park's northeast entrance were evacuted twice last week. Jardine,
Mont., near the northern gate, was evacuated Saturday.
   Firefighters saved Cooke City and Silver Gate, but only by
burning thousands of acres of forest to remove fuel from the fire's
path. The so-called backfires left the once-picturesque towns
flanked by black, skeletal trees.

   When it comes to abortion, George Bush and
Michael Dukakis agree on one thing: each man says he personally
does not favor the controversial procedure.
   But beyond their personal feelings, the Republican and
Democratic presidential nominees have staked out opposite stands on
whether abortion should be legal and whether the government should
pay for the operation for poor women.
   Bush favors a constitutional amendment to overturn the 1973
Supreme Court decision, Roe vs. Wade, that legalized abortion. He
favors outlawing all abortions except in cases of rape, incest or
to save the life of the mother. He opposes Medicaid funding of
abortions for poor women except to save the woman's life.
   Dukakis, as a legislator and governor of Massachusetts, has been
a resolute supporter of women's legal right to choose abortion, as
well as government-funding of the operation for the poor.

   Iraq's use of poison gas against its Kurdish
minority is prompting concern that other nations bogged down in
armed conflict might resort to the ``silent killer'' in violation
of a universally accepted ban on use of chemical weapons.
   According to U.S. officials, there is little question that
Iraq's use of mustard gas against Iranian forces influenced Iran's
decision to end their eight-year old Persian Gulf war last month.
   Almost immediately after the cease-fire took effect, Iraq
launched an offensive against its Kurdish minority as suspected
collaborators with Iran. Tens of thousands of Kurds were forced to
flee into southern Turkey.

   President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari is
tough and highly disciplined despite his modest demeanor, qualities
he will need to govern Mexico for the next six years.
   Salinas, 40, faces protracted economic problems that affect
Mexico's relationship with the United States and a vocal opposition
that still questions whether his mandate was won fairly.
   ``Given the circumstances, he is going to have to be a great
president because otherwise the problems of the country will become
enormously complicated,'' said Manuel Camacho Solis, a close
colleague and general secretary of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
   An illustration of one lingering problem was the vote Saturday
by the Chamber of Deputies to certify Salinas' July 6 election as
president. Virtually all votes came from the governing party,
called the PRI for its Spanish initials.
   The opposition, which held the PRI to 50.7 percent of the
official vote _ the lowest since PRI took power in 1929, maintains
the presidency was won by fraud.

   Gov. Bill Clements will help dedicate a state
historical marker Monday to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the

   The anniversary comes as Texas itself is in the midst of a broad

   Integrated circuits, which have come to be known as computer
chips and are the brains behind everything from microcomputers to
musical greeting cards, first were demonstrated on Sept. 12, 1958
in a laboratory at Texas Instruments Inc. headquarters.
   The historic marker, to be unveiled in a 9 a.m. CDT ceremony,
honors Jack St. Clair Kilby, who first demonstrated his idea that
basic building blocks of elecronics _ capacitors, transistors and
resistors _ could be built out of a single semiconductive material.
   The discovery helped eliminate the expense and time needed to
hand-solder electronic circuits.
   Kilby, who will attend Monday's ceremony, constructed a crude
working model from a material called germanium. He later helped
invent a hand-held calculator developed to show the commercial
potential of the integrated circuit.
   Kilby's first integrated circuit had nine components in a space
one-sixteenth of an inch wide by seven-sixteenths of an inch long.
Now, 180 billion integrated circuits later, more than 700,000
components can be crammed onto a chip.
   Texas itself is hitching its economic hopes to computer chip
development and manufacturing.
   TI announced last Thursday that it would spend $30 million in
the next six months to a year developing a prototype production
line at its Dallas headquarters for future-generation RISC chips.
   Four other top chipmakers plan to help Texas become a world
center of chip development.
   Within about an hour's drive of each other in Austin,
International Business Machines Corp., Motorola Inc., Cypress
Semiconductor Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. all are
developing RISC chips. Each has established or will establish major
research, design and development facilities in the area.
   Craig Ensley, vice president of four-year-old Austin-based
Crystal Semiconductor, told the Dallas Morning News that Texas'
gains in chipmaking are proof the semiconductor industry is
shifting its focus from the West Coast to Texas.
   ``There's no question that by the mid-1990s, Texas will be the
dominant center of gravity of the semiconductor industry in this
country,'' Ensley said.
   In volume of chip production and number of wafer factories,
Texas is second only to California and far ahead of any other
state, according to In-Stat Inc., a semiconductor industry
statistical source in Scottsdale, Ariz.
   The volume and variety of chips being made surpasses the days
two decades ago when the semiconductor industry in the state could
be described in two words: Texas Instruments.
   TI now makes everything from the most basic ``glue logic'' chips
to the most advanced 1 million-bit dynamic random access memory _
or DRAM _ chips at its 21 silicon wafer factories in Sherman,
Dallas, Houston and Lubbock.
   Glue logic chips are devices that hold electronic circuits
together and permit memory chips and microprocessors to
communicate. Semiconductors now account for 46 percent of TI's
sales and once again are setting records in unit and dollar volume.
   In Carrollton, Europe's leading semiconductor company, SGS
Thomson Microelectronics, has resurrected what used to be known as
Mostek Corp. and is running its plant there six days a week. In
Irving, Japan's Hitachi Semiconductor is set to begin producing
DRAM chips.
   Silicon Valley-based companies are found all over: National
Semiconductor Corp. in Arlington, Cypress Semiconductor in Austin,
Advanced Micro Devices in Austin and San Antonio, and VLSI
Technology in San Antonio.
   There also are a pair of Texas-bred start-ups: Crystal
Semiconductor in Austin and Dallas Semiconductor. The two ventures
make special-purpose chips that can be found in machinery from
digital tape recorders to gasoline pumps.
   Texas also can boast the U.S. chipmaking industry's only two
cooperative research efforts, Sematech and Microelectronics and
Computer Technology Corp., both based in Austin.

<HEAD>GM Ends Move Toward `Outsourcing' of Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Auto analysts say General Motors Corp. is using
fewer outside parts suppliers while keeping more of its $40 billion
annual parts production within the company.
   Improved union-management relations and the strong hand of GM
President Robert Stempel are behind the shift away from
``outsourcing,'' long a target of United Auto Workers union
criticism.
   ``In every single plant, labor and management are sitting down
together and reviewing problems and putting programs in place,''
said Donald Ephlin, a UAW vice president and head of the union's GM
department. ``That never happened before.''
   GM continues making more of its own parts than do Ford Motor Co.
or Chrysler Corp. The No.1 automaker was producing 72 percent of
its own parts as recently as May, compared with 54 percent at Ford
and 39 percent at Chrysler, according to the University of
Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation.
   A year earlier, GM was planning to reduce internal parts
production to 50 percent by 1992, said David Cole, director of the
university office. GM's apparent reversal has drawn new criticism
from some of the outside parts makers it once relied upon.
   Smaller suppliers will go out of business and larger ones will
shift their work toward Ford and Chrysler, said the chief executive
of one major supplier, who asked that his name not be used.
   A spokesman for GM's components division, which employs 200,000
workers, denied the automaker deliberately had brought more parts
production back within the GM fold.
   ``The components group is fighting for every piece of business
it can get,'' Jerry Bishop said. ``We're fighting for it within GM
and outside GM.''
   Stempel, however, made his position on the issue clear last year
during his first news conference as president, saying, ``My
objective is to get competitive, not to outsource and close.''
   Under Stempel, GM has looked beyond the immediate bottom line of
the cost of parts, said Maryanne Keller, a New York-based industry
analyst.
   GM officials earlier ``accepted this simplistic rationalization
that went, `We're paying $28 an hour for labor, and outside
companies are paying $8 an hour, so no wonder we're not cost
competitive,''' she said.
   ``Now they have a broader view of the cost equation _ that a lot
of the problems result from bad organization and bad management
philosophy,'' Keller said. ``That means they have it within their
own power to cure the problems and, in many cases, without spending
a lot of money.''
   Top GM officials were unavailable for comment. But a UAW member
who spoke on condition of anonymity said Chairman Roger Smith
expressed his support for GM's new approach at a meeting two weeks
ago with union officials.
   ``A lot of what (Smith) talked about was family, about the fact
that workers are family and suppliers are not, and that from now
on, family is going to be taken care of first,'' the UAW member
said.
