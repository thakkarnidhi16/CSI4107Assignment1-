   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson held a summit
just hours before the Democratic National Convention opened Monday,
with Jackson saying ``I've sent a signal'' for unity in the fall
campaign and Dukakis agreeing to specific steps to strengthen the
role of his rival's supporters in the party.
   Dukakis insisted there was no deal, no fine print worked out in
the nearly three-hour meeting at his hotel, only a better
relationship with the man who fought for the presidential
nomination until the end.
   ``I want Jesse Jackson to play a major role in this campaign. I
want his supporters, who are out there by the millions, to be
deeply involved in this campaign,'' Dukakis told a packed news
conference after the meeting. ``And he is going to be involved
actively and fully.''
   ``Obviously, I want to play a supportive role, a complementary
role,'' Jackson said Monday night.
   The agreement between the candidates includes financial backing
from party funds to pay for Jackson's campaigning on behalf of the
ticket and needed personal staff, said Ron Brown, Jackson's
convention manager.
   ``Of course funding will be made available for the travel plans
for Rev. Jackson,'' said Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas.
   ``If the man's got to travel, we're not going to let him fly
commercial,'' said Joseph Warren, a longtime Dukakis supporter who
has been involved in the negotiations. ``Make no mistake about it.
What Jesse needs, Jesse will get.''
   In addition, Jackson supporters will get close to half the new
25 at-large slots on the Democratic National Committee and a new
vice DNC chairman.
   ``When the Democratic National Committee meets on Friday, it
will be more reflective of the new Democratic Party,'' Jackson said.
   California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, an outspoken Jackson
backer, revealed the vice chairman slot as part of the deal and
pronounced herself satisfied.
   ``Dukakis announced it to the world: He needs Jesse Jackson,''
she said.
   And Jackson made it clear that he was sending the signal to his
supporters that Dukakis had looked for since the primaries ended.
   ``I've sent a signal that we are involved,'' Jackson said,
adding that Dukakis now must send a signal to Jackson backers. ``In
some sense, Gov. Dukakis must convey to those persons that he is
reaching out ot them, that he cares for them, that they are on his
agenda. When it is all said and done, the nominee must convince
people.''
   And there was a wave of speculation about Jackson's impact on a
Dukakis administration, even though Jackson says he wants no job.
   ``There are many things one could think of. He could be an
outstanding drug czar,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright. ``He has
the passion, the belief, the dedication.''
   DNC Treasurer Sharon Pratt Dixon said that there was ``clearly
going to be a reflection of Jesse Jackson in a Dukakis
administration.''
   Speaking with reporters after the Jackson supporter addressed
the convention, Dixon said he might be used as ``sort of a roving
ambassador. Jesse Jackson sees himself in a more global
perspective. That's his scene, that's his stage.''
   For his part, Jackson was upbeat about the meeting with Dukakis
and his running mate _ in part because there were no roadblocks to
his pushing platform ideas in Tuesday night's convention session.
   ``We did not come here for fireworks. We came here for noble
works,'' Jackson told more than 2,000 of his delegates and
supporters.
   ``Today we had a great meeting with Governor Dukakis and Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, a serious meeting,'' he added. ``In that meeting,
there was the good judgment that debate is healthy for democracy.''
   ``I think there was a real meeting of the minds,'' said Brown,
who sat in on the meeting.
   The summit meeting was held in Dukakis's hotel suite, just
across Peachtree Street from the hotel where Jackson is staying.
   Jackson has bedeviled Dukakis for weeks by pushing his
presidential hopes and then his hopes for the vice presidency,
saying he and his constituency had earned consideration. After
Dukakis picked Bentsen for the No. 2 spot, the tensions between the
campaigns increased.
   At last, at the news conference, Jackson admitted his campaign
would officially end Wednesday night.
   ``I'm still looking for a Chicago miracle,'' Jackson said, a
near impossibility considering Dukakis' lock on far more than a
majority of the delegates. ``If the miracle does not come to pass,
then we'll have passed over to the next phase of our campaign.''
   A bit later, the Greek-American governor of Massachusetts
replied: ``I don't think we're going to have a Chicago miracle ...
we're going to have an Athenian miracle.''
   Jackson said he wouldn't encourage anyone to put his name on the
roll call on Thursday night when Bentsen is scheduled to be
confirmed as the vice presidential nominee.
   And Jackson promised to work for the ticket against George Bush
and the Republicans in the fall.
   ``We met and discussed matters of serious and significant
concern, a relationship of substance, support and candor, the
commitment to help build a team that will expand our party and
carry us to victory in November,'' he told the news conference.
   At a later stop, Jackson added, ``There was no discussion today
on the planks for the platform.''
   Asked if he was depressed by the end of his campaign, Jackson
said it was the opposite: ``There's a sense of relief.''
   Brountas denied that any agreement was reached that would
guarantee Jackson supporters a role in a transition to a Dukakis
administration, should the Democrats win in the fall.
   ``We decided not to go beyond the campaign,'' Brountas said.
   Jackson agreed, adding that a future role will follow naturally:
``That's a bit far off, but it stands to reason if you're part of
the campaign. ... If you win, you are part of the transition and
you're part of the government. Let's take it one step at a
time....''

   Former President Jimmy Carter, the last Democrat
to occupy the White House, was back on prime time Monday night at
the opening session of the Democratic National Convention and told
delegates that ``we are the party of change.''
   Introduced as ``a great American and a great Democrat,'' Carter
forecast that the party's presidential ticket of Michael Dukakis
and Lloyd Bentsen would recapture the White House ``not just so
Democrats can take office in Washington, but because we know that
change is long overdue.
   ``We want the federal deficit brought under control. We want a
coherent foreign policy,'' he said. ``We want to bring back to
Washington people who are more interested in public service that in
private gain.''
   The former president, swept out of office by Ronald Reagan in
1980, took a jab at Republican George Bush's effort to continue
running against him by reminding voters of the double-digit
interest and inflation rates that prevailed during his last year in
office.
   ``I have one announcement to make,'' said Carter ``which, like a
number of other things this year may come as a bit of a surprise to
the incumbent vice president.
   ``My name is Jimmy Carter and I am not running for president.
Did you hear that, George?''
   The former president was the last speaker at the opening
session, taking the podium about a half hour after Texas State
Treasurer Ann Richards delivered the keynote address.
   By the time he spoke, the crowd that packed the hall for Ms.
Richards' speech had thinned and many seats were empty.
   Former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie, who introduced
Carter, reminded the delegates of the Camp David Accords which
brought peace between Egypt and Israel.
   ``He told the truth, he made his country strong,'' said Muskie.
   During his speech, Carter appealed to the Democrats to unite
behind the party's presidential ticket.
   ``If I had to give you just one special message tonight, I would
summarize it in a single word,'' he said. ``Unity.''
   ``Let us go forth from this convention united behind our
candidates and our ideals _ and with our eyes on the prize,'' he
said.
   Carter carried only six states and the District of Columbia in
1980 and the economic statistics, the Iran hostage crisis and his
description of the nation as suffering from a ``malaise'' were
frequent targets of Republican rhetoric in the 1984 campaign.
   His presidency was seen even by many Democrats as a failure and
he was largely ignored by his party for years, although he
addressed the 1984 convention in San Francisco.
   But this year he was welcomed back by his party just as he
welcomed the Democrats to Georgia, where he served as governor
before running for president.
   Hours before Carter addressed the convention, Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson turned up for a luncheon at the Carter Presidential Center.
   In his convention speech, Carter praised both men.
   ``Jesse Jackson has stirred the soul of our country, given hope
to millions, and healed wounds that have too long divided our
people from one another. He is an inspired leader destined for
further greatness,'' he said.
   Dukakis, said Carter, ``ran a brilliant campaign of substance
and respect for the intelligence of the American people. He'll be a
great leader for our country.''
   Carter said the nation ``deserves a foreign policy based on the
values that unite us as Americans'' and then turning to criticism
of the Reagan administration, he cited ``unilateral White House
decisions ... U.S. Marines dying in Lebanon; harbors illegally
mined and Contras illegally armed; ransom paid in weapons to the
ayatollah; appeasement in the face of apartheid in South Africa.''
   ``We Democrats do not fear change,'' he said. ``We welcome it.
Change means hope. Change means life. Above all, change means
opportunity. ...
   ``Our party is best equipped to meet the challenge of change
because we are the party of change.''

<HEAD>Asian-Americans Earn More, But Still Face Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asian-Americans are better paid and better
educated than American whites, but a report by government civil
rights experts is reluctant to declare an ``Asian success story''
and insists that discrimination still exists.
   Presentation of the 289-page study to the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights, which had ordered it, prompted concern over its
impact. One commissioner, Mary Frances Berry of the University of
Pennsylvania, said it might lead to more discrimination when the
public realizes how much more Asians are earning.
   Six of the seven commissioners voted Friday to hold off on
adopting the document as an official government report until more
outside experts can review and interpret it.
   The study, billed as the first comprehensive look at the incomes
of nearly 4 million Asian-American residents, shows that
native-born American families with Chinese ancestry earn 50 percent
more than families in which both husband and wife are white, and
Korean and Japanese families earn 46 percent and 44 percent more,
respectively.
   But some Asian-American ethnic groups are not faring so well.
   U.S.-born Filipinos and Indians, along with recently immigrated
Vietnamese, have below average incomes, with non-immigrant Filipino
families earning 80 percent of non-Hispanic whites, Indians 71
percent and Vietnamese immigrants 60 percent.
   Based on 1980 census and more-recent immigration figures, the
study puts average annual income for U.S.-born Chinese families at
$39,805, compared with $26,514 for white families. The figures for
other households headed by Asian-Americans born in the United
States are: Korean, $38,610; Japanese, $38,324; Filipino, $21,190;
and Indian, $18,789.
   No figures are given for U.S.-born Vietnamese, since nearly all
Vietnamese have come to the United States within the last 25 years
and few adults are native Americans.
   In the figures for more recently immigrated Asian families,
incomes are much closer to those of white Americans, with the
exception of Vietnamese immigrants, who earn an average of $15,873,
the study says.
   The study notes that immigrant Asian families tend to be
somewhat larger than other U.S. families with more family members
working, but this is not necessarily true of Asian families which
have been in the United States for generations.
   It also says that poverty rates are lower than average for U.S.
Chinese, Japanese and Korean families, while they tend to be higher
than average for families who trace their roots to the Philippines,
India and Vietnam.
   Commission assistant staff director James Cunningham, who helped
direct the study, said it was undertaken with the understanding
that discrimination exists against Asian-Americans and was an
attempt to measure its impact.
   The fact that it shows higher-than-average earnings for most
Asian ethnic groups, however, ``is by no means to say there is an
Asian success story,'' Cunningham said.
   The study points out that early Asian immigrants were laborers,
with a second wave beginning in the 1960s consisting of
higher-educated people who should qualify for better-paying jobs.
The trend recently has swung back to less-skilled immigrants coming
to join U.S. resident family members, it says.
   The study gives the average years of schooling for Asians born
in the United States as 14.9 for Chinese, 13.82 for Koreans, 13.73
for Japanese, 13.42 for Indians and 12.4 for Filipinos. The average
for non-Hispanic whites is 12.86.
   The study says Asians historically have suffered serious
discrimination in the United States, sometimes due to anti-Asian
laws, and it says there are still some instances of it.
   But it concludes that there now is not systematic job
discrimination against Asians in general.
   And it says there is no evidence of job discrimination against
Asian women, either native-born or foreign-born, with ethnic Asian
women more likely to work and earn more than white women.
   But the study says the statistics indicate ``employment and
earnings disparities may be caused by labor market discrimination
directed against native-born Indian and Filipino men.''
   It also says that further study is needed to determine whether
Asians are prevented from attaining high management levels because
of their racial origins. The study says that while there are more
Asians per capita than whites in professional positions, fewer
attain management status.
   ``The census data do not enable us to determine whether such a
pattern is caused by discrimination or choice,'' says the report,
which was written largely by staff economist Harriet Duleep.
   The 1980 census lists the U.S. Asian population as 806,040
Chinese, 774,652 Filipinos, 700,974 Japanese, 361,531 Indians,
354,593 Koreans, 261,729 Vietnamese and 378,644 with other Asian or
Pacific origins. Filipinos, who have been immigrating in far
greater numbers than other Asian groups over the past several
years, are now believed to outnumber U.S. Chinese.
   Asian minorities make up about 1.45 percent of the total U.S.
population.

   Fire spread through a row house Sunday,
killing four children, and the resulting smoke and falling
electrical wires injured at least 16 firefighters, officials said.
   The two-alarm fire began shortly after 5:30 p.m. and spread
next-door to another building. It was under control in about an
hour, and the cause remained undetermined, said fire officials.
   The children's mother, Denise Pressley, 34, was treated at St.
Agnes Medical Center for second-degree burns on her arms, said
nursing supervisor Tina Trants.
   A nursing supervisor at Crozer Chester Medical Center said a man
of unknown age was in critical condition and was treated for burns.
   Two firefighters who had been electrocuted were in guarded
condition at Misericordia Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman
Elizabeth Secor. She said fallen electrical wires struck the
firefighters as they battled the blaze.
   One firefighter was transferred from Misericordia to St. Agnes
for treatment of electrocution burns, she said. Ms. Trants said he
was listed in guarded condition. Two other firefighters at St.
Agnes were treated and released for smoke inhalation.
   Ms. Secor said seven other firefighters were treated for smoke
inhalation and were under observation.
   Fire officials said four other firefighters were treated for
smoke inhalation at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center
and released.
   Officials at the medical examiner's said they plan to conduct
autopsies on the children, whose identities and ages were not
available Sunday evening.

<HEAD>Records Subpoenaed on Congressman's Health Club Dealings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators probing alleged fraud in
Pentagon weapons contracts have subpoenaed records related to a
Florida health club in which Rep. Bill Chappell once had an
interest, a lawyer said Sunday.
   Edwin C. Cluster of Ocala, Fla., said he received a subpoena
dated June 23 from the federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va.,
requesting documents related to the health club and to the company
that acquired the club from Chappell, a Florida Democrat.
   Cluster refused to elaborate, saying in a telephone interview,
``I got the subpoena and that's all I'll say.''
   Federal officials are investigating allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former military men,
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Chappell, whose name has come up in connection with the defense
probe, is chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee on
defense. However, authorities have said no member of Congress is a
target in the investigation.
   The Washington Post reported earlier this month that the Racquet
Club of Ocala Inc. intervened in late 1984 to cancel Chappell's and
his partner's personal liability for a large part of their
indebtedness for a failed Ocala health club and also removed the
two men as defendants in a suit related to its foreclosure.
   The principal officers of the Racquet Club were Leonard Killgore
and George L. Dalferes. Killgore, a former Chappell aide, was then
an official with the Washington office of Avco Corp., a rocket
builder. The Post reported in Monday's editions that Chappell
acknowledged in a 1984 civil case that he began living in
Killgore's house with the Killgore family in October or November of
1983.
   Dalferes was vice president of government affairs at Martin
Marietta Corp. _ another major defense contractor _ at the
company's office just outside Washington. Martin Marietta reported
that it bought the health club in May 1986, a little more than a
year after Dalferes and his partners rescued it from foreclosure in
the deal that canceled Chappell's personal liability for the failed
health club.
   The citizens lobby group, Common Cause, has called on the House
ethics committee to investigate Chappell's ties to military
contractors, citing the arrangement to relieve Chappell of
liability on the health club.
   Chappell, in a statement in early July, said there was
``absolutely no benefit to me either way'' from the transaction.
   ``It was an arm's length transaction, as supported by public
record,'' he said.
   Contacted by the Post about the subpoena, he said through a
spokesman that the truth about the deal had been misrepresented and
he declined further comment.

   A gunman shot two men, killing one, as they were
preparing to board a bus Sunday in what may have been a
gang-related incident, police said.
   Michael Roberts, 18, was hit with gunfire and collapsed inside
the bus, while the other victim, Mark Burgos, 21, fell before
entering the vehicle, said Sgt. Barbara Matula.
   The bus driver radioed for help, but Roberts was dead on arrival
at Mount Sinai Hospital and Medical Center, nursing supervisor
Lilian Payne said. Burgos was in fair condition with a forearm
wound, Ms. Payne said.
   Both Chicago men were heading home after being released from
Cook County Jail when a man began walking behind them ``making
gang-related remarks,'' Ms. Matula said.
   ``They had on gang colors and unfortunately they were in a
different gang's territory,'' Ms. Matula said. ``This is what
attracted the attention of the offender.
   ``They should have taken a cab,'' the sergeant said.
   Police were searching for the gunman, who fled on foot.

<HEAD>U.S. Gains in Energy Efficiency May Be Reversing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen years after the first oil embargo, the
U.S. economy has stopped making gains in energy efficiency,
according to experts who say the country may be losing ground.
   Low prices account for the change, along with the fact the
United States uses much more energy in comparison with other
countries, analysts say.
   The Energy Information Administration has revised 1987 figures
to show efficiency unchanged from 1986, Jerry Lagace, an EIA
economist, said in an interview Friday.
   It's the first time since 1976 that efficiency failed to improve.
   Lagace noted that energy efficiency in the economy may have
increased for the first quarter of the year over the 1987 quarter,
but the 3.5 percent increase ``is so large that I don't believe it.
This will probably be revised downward.''
   Gains have been running at about 2.5 percent per year since the
mid-1970s; EIA had expected future gains of about 1 percent per
year. Preliminary 1987 statistics had indicated a 0.5 percent gain
over 1986.
   Lagace said further study is needed to pin down reasons. Growing
exports of goods that take a lot of energy to produce, such as farm
machinery, could be one reason. More driving is another possibility.
   Efficiency has been improving throughout the industrial market
economies since the 1960s, though the 1973 oil embargo greatly
accelerated it. U.S. performance has been strong; some major U.S.
competitors have done better.
   ``Energy is very cheap here,'' said Art Rosenfeld, director of
the Center for Building Science at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory at Berkeley, Calif.
   ``When you and I were growing up, they flared natural gas, and
we built a lot of uninsulated houses because it was cheaper to burn
more gas than to add insulation,'' Rosenfeld said in an interview.
   Attitudes change slowly, so ``we haven't paid attention to
investments that take five, six or seven years to pay back, like
the Germans and the Japanese do,'' Rosenfeld said.
   Europe and Japan use high gasoline taxes to raise revenue and
hold down consumption, while the United States throughout the 1970s
kept gasoline under price controls and required minimum mileage
standards for automobiles. Gasoline in Italy last year was
quadruple the U.S. price; in Japan triple and in Germany more than
double.
   Today, the average new U.S. car must get 26 miles per gallon and
all cars average 18.9 mpg, 42 percent better than in 1973. The
average Italian car gets 30 mpg and in Japan the average is 31 mpg.
   If U.S. cars _ nevermind trucks and buses _ did as well as
Italy's, U.S. gasoline consumption in 1986 would have been about 28
billion gallons or 25 percent less.
   ``Triple the price of gasoline and usage would be cut in half
over time,'' said Mark Ross, a professor of physics at the
University of Michigan who is working on energy studies.
   Last year's 94.8 cent average price for a gallon of unleaded
regular was the lowest ever, after factoring out inflation.
   Many Americans want big gains before doing anything. Several
studies have shown that homeowners refuse storm windows and other
projects offered by utilities if the payback takes longer than six
months.
   Industries with reserves of engineering talent like chemicals
and electronics have made major strides. Dow Chemical Co. USA
recorded a 40 percent reduction in energy needed to make a pound of
chemicals from 1972 to 1987.
   But many are ignoring opportunities. It takes 25 million BTUs
for U.S. steel makers to produce a ton; Japan does it with 17
million, said William Chandler, an analyst with the Batelle
Memorial Institute's Washington office.
   International Energy Agency figures show the United States in
eighth place among 20 major countries in industrial efficiency
gains from 1973 through 1985, behind Japan, Luxembourg, Britain,
Germany, Denmark, Italy and Belgium, and fourth behind Canada,
Norway and Luxembourg in use, measured by energy per dollar of
value added in manufacturing, mining, construction and agriculture.
   Some gains stem from the decline of heavy industry. The IEA
estimated that lower production accounted for 55 percent of the
reduction in U.S. total industrial energy use from what it would
have been in 1983 if efficiency trends of the 1960s had continued
unchanged. That was a recession year and later figures are not
available.
   Overall, counting cars, buildings and everything, the United
States still uses more energy per dollar than anybody but Canada.
   The United States was 24 percent below Canada, but 22 percent
above third-place New Zealand, 97 percent above West Germany, 110
percent above Japan and 144 percent above the best performer,
Switzerland.
   The 23 percent U.S. improvement over 1973 was bettered only by
Luxembourg's 43 percent and Japan's 31 percent.
   There are longer distances to drive in the United States, but
Chandler said geography and climate account for ``at most a
quarter'' of the differences with Europe.

<HEAD>Conservationists Worry About Overplanting After Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought and heat have riddled much of this
year's grain crop, but some conservationists already are worried
about 1989 and what might happen if good weather sends farmers
flocking into fields to catch up.
   Assuming the drought breaks and farmers have a normal season in
1989, beginning with this fall's planting of next year's winter
wheat crop, producers could opt to take advantage of higher
commodity prices by staying out of federal acreage programs and
plant fence-row to fence-row.
   Kenneth A. Cook, senior associate at The Conservation
Foundation, a private research organization based in Washington,
says Congress ought to look harder at this question before putting
the finishing touches on an emergency aid plan to help farmers
recover from the drought.
   ``Let's say a guy gets a check for $10,000 or $20,000 or
$50,000,'' Cook said. ``Is there any expectation that if he's
gotten that assistance in the fall of 1988 he'll have to behave
responsibly toward his land in the spring of 1989?''
   The measure, which appears all but certain to be signed by
President Reagan, has cleared the Senate Agriculture Committee. It
would provide payments of up to $100,000 for drought-stricken
farmers and could cost up to $7 billion overall.
   Similar aid is being packaged in the House, but was kept open
for possible fine-tuning when lawmakers return to work on July 26.
After working out differences between Senate and House versions,
the drought-aid bill could reach the White House in August or early
September.
   ``Some of these checks are going to be pretty big,'' Cook said
in a telephone interview Friday. ``Do we have a hold on that fellow
next year when he's going out to plant his fields?''
   Cook said he and other environmental advocates fear the
drought-aid money being earmarked by Congress could help finance
crop expansion that might threaten millions of acres of land that
should not be planted at all.
   This involves the set-aside or acreage reserve land that is
taken from production under annual commodity programs to qualify a
farmer for price supports and target price ``deficiency'' payments
on the remainder of his acreage used for crops.
   Farmers signed up to take 54 million acres from production this
year under these annual programs, which include wheat, feed grains,
cotton and rice. Under the 1985 farm law, they are required to
maintain the idled land in ways to protect it from erosion.
   That doesn't include 25 million acres locked out of production
for 10 years under the long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
Under it, farmers agree to idle highly erodible land and protect it
by planting grass or trees in return for annual rental payments
from the government.
   Another provision of the 1985 law involves ``sodbuster'' and
``swampbuster'' prohibitions against plowing up new land for crops.
If a farmer does that, he stands a chance of losing all price
support and other benefits.
   But Cook said that if commodity prices remain or continue
higher, many farmers may be tempted to stay out of government
programs in hopes of making it financially on larger plantings, at
least for a year or two.
   ``What happens when the good times roll? That's the question
we're asking _ and we're hoping that the good times do roll,'' he
said. ``We want prices to come back, because it's bad for the
environment when prices are low and farmers are not able to afford
good conservation.''
   Cook added: ``But it's nonsense to think that without some kind
of control we're going to have sound conservation during a period
of expansion. The 1970s proved that.''
   Beginning with huge grain sales to the Soviet Union in the early
1970s, exports soared, encouraging more land to be brought into
production. The export market faded in the early 1980s, however,
and federal programs had to be expanded to take more land out of
production.
   The current drought is reducing grain stockpiles sharply and has
sent commodity prices up sharply. On Friday, the Labor Department
reported that drought sent wholesale prices of raw food up 4.2
percent in June, the most in more than 2{ years.
   Examples of price increases at the unprocessed-food level in
June, according to the Labor Department, included: wheat, up 25.3
percent; corn, 24.3 percent; and soybeans, 22 percent.
   ``Strong conservation measures come about in hard times (as they
did in the 1985 law) because, politically, the farm community
needed to get the large amounts of funds that were required,'' Cook
said.
   ``Now, we're in a situation where it's a drought, and it truly
is an emergency in many parts of the country,'' he added. ``We know
that assistance is needed, and the environmental community stands
strongly behind assistance to the farm sector. That's not the
question. The question is what happens next year if farm prices
(continue higher) and if participation in the programs drops.''

<HEAD>Heavy Rains Trigger Floods, Landslide That Kills 18 Shantytown
Residents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy weekend rains in
drought-prone northeastern Brazil were blamed for 40 deaths, nearly
half of them in a landslide that swept through a hillside
shantytown, news reports said.
   The rains, said to force the evacuation of 20,000 people, hit
hardest in the city of Maceio in Alagoas state about 1,480 miles
from Rio de Janeiro.
   Eighteen people were killed in Maceio on Sunday when dirt
loosened by the rains crushed their stick-and-mud homes, according
to TV Globo, the nation's largest private television network.
   It said the other victims, also in Maceio, were either buried in
their homes or drowned.
   Fernando Melo, governor of Alagoas state, declared a state of
emergency. He told the network that the rains were wrecking
Maceio's sewage, water and electric facilities.
   In neighboring Pernambuco state, recently parched by drought,
about 6,000 people were forced from their homes and were being
sheltered in schools and churches, the network said.
   The rest of the evacuees were scattered through a nine-state
region known for periodic droughts and desperate poverty. The
northeast is regularly punished by dry spells that sometimes last
for years.
   During the last drought, from 1979 to 1984, about 250,000
farmers died. Millions of others fled the region.

   Cleanup crews have recovered close
to 460,000 gallons of spilled oil from the Port of Corpus Christi
and officials say the short-term damage to wildlife appears to be
minor.
   The port was closed at midnight Wednesday after the Nord
Pacific, a 780-foot oil tanker, crashed into a Southwestern
Refinery oil dock, spilling more than 600,000 gallons of oil.
   The Inner Harbor was opened Friday to ship traffic on a limited
daytime-only basis, said Coast Guard Lt. Margaret Jones.
   ``Things are going so smooth that it looks like we might be able
to open (fully) Monday or Tuesday,'' Ms. Jones said.
   ``We're pretty effective at getting the oil out of the water,''
she said. ``There's been some normal sheen of oil in the water, but
no oil has been stirred up.''
   The spill endangered birds and marine life, officials said, and
may have a long-term affect on wildlife.
   ``There will be a reduction in food sources, such as plankton,
needed by such organisms as shrimp and crabs,'' Larry Gamble,
environmental contaminant specialist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said Saturday.
   Gamble said crabs and jellyfish have been affected by the spill,
but that the short-term damage appeared to be minimal.
   ``I've found quite a few blue crabs, fiddler crabs and one
hermit crab dead in the marshy area,'' he said. In addition, he
said, at least two birds and an opossum died from the spill.
   ``There have probably been more than two birds killed, because
when birds are injured, they're vulnerable to prey and so they hide
and we might not have found them yet,'' Gamble said.
   Gamble and volunteers sounded a propane cannon and air horns
Saturday to steer birds away from the oily marsh area near the
dock. Volunteers have been at the scene Every day since the
accident.

   A two-year-old boy ate insects and
sucked on wet foliage to stay alive while missing for five days in
rugged bush country populated by wild pigs, snakes and crocodiles,
police said today.
   Eric Taylor was found Sunday, naked but suffering only from
dehydration and scratches. He was expected to be released from the
hospital later today.
   Clad only in a diaper and undershirt, the boy had apparently
wandered on Wednesday from his family's farm, which is surrounded
by heavily-wooded terrain about 20 miles south of Cooktown in far
northern Queensland state.
   Eric grinned and held out his arms when he was discovered by
rescue workers 400 yards up a mountain track and more than a mile
from his home.
   Nearly 300 people, including aboriginal trackers, took part in
the search.
   Police said they had feared Eric tumbled into the
crocodile-infested Tannon River, which flows near his home.
   ``He's a lot brighter than most kids of his age and a lot
tougher,'' said Eric's father, Paul.
   Police Sgt. Ken Salmon, the search coordinator, said the area
where Eric was eventually found had been scoured a number of times.
   ``Believe me, its rugged, treacherous country,'' he said. ``We
are both stunned and jubilant at finding the boy.''

<DATELINE>CONCEPCION, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet, evidently
seeking eight more years of rule, has toned down his authoritarian
image. In public appearances, he portrays himself as tender-hearted
as well as tough-minded.
   In addition, the right-wing army commander tries to present his
government as more democratic and participative. Political analysts
see it as a bid to win the electoral backing of many undecided
Chileans.
   ``I can't govern alone. I need you to help me,'' he told a group
of youths at a breakfast meeting in the southern city of Concepcion
during a question-and-answer session peppered with avuncular
observations and jokes.
   He told the audience a new period of rule for his government
``will bring fundamental change. There will be a democracy.''
   The government plans, by early October, a yes-or-no ballot on a
presidential candidate to be picked by the heads of the army, air
force, navy and national police. No specific date has been set and
no candidate yet named. But Pinochet, who as army chief will
participate in the selection, is seen as the probable nominee.
   If he wins the ballot, the candidate will serve eight years
starting in March 1989. If he loses, an open election will be held
in 1990 and Pinochet remains in power until then.
   Pinochet's frequent trips and public rallies have all the
earmarks of a presidential campaign in high gear: confetti and
balloons fill the air, colorful banners proclaim support for a
``yes'' vote and crowds cheer Pinochet's predictions of an
electoral victory.
   His change in personal style has emerged at the gatherings and
in pro-government advertisements aired regularly on television.
Three-piece suits have been substituted for the military uniform he
long favored. Gone are the scowl and dark sunglasses of the first
years after he seized power in a bloody 1973 coup.
   He smiles broadly, kissing and embracing women and children.
During trips to the provinces he always drops in at a local
bookstore and buys several volumes on religion, philosophy and
history.
   During the overnight trip to Concepcion he purchased, among
other books, Erich Fromm's ``The Art of Loving.''
   In an interview published by the Santiago newspaper La Tercera,
Pinochet stressed his human side, declaring: ``Those who know me
well realize I am not a tough man, but a principled one.''
   ``I've never had trouble getting along with anyone,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   Maria Eugenia Hirmas, a sociologist specializing in mass
communications, says Pinochet's campaign strategists ``are starting
to introduce elements that neutralize his image of toughness and
intransigence.''
   ``They have him in civilian dress, they show him in contact with
children and young people, with women, smiling and with an open
expression,'' she wrote in a study for the Santiago-based Latin
American Institute for Trans-National Studies.
   She told The Associated Press that the intent is to ``show him
as a family man, the loving grandfather ... a man with whom you can
talk.''
   She noted, however, that Pinochet still retains his tough side,
which reveals itself in intense anger and scathing sarcasm whenever
he refers to his critics.
   Addressing a recent rally of supporters in Talcahuano, a port
city near Concepcion, Pinochet called opposition leaders
``traitors'' and said they have ``sold their own mothers'' for
political gain.
   In the plebescite, he said, ``we will wipe them off the map.''
   The crowd loved the tough talk, responding with the chant:
``Hard hand, Pinochet.''
   ``He has two messages, for two different groups,'' Mrs. Hirmas
said. ``For the more moderate group, he is a man of reason, capable
of leading a political transition. For the other group, he is the
tough military man saying, `Watch out. We know how to use force.' ''
   Carlos Huneeus, a political scientist and pollster openly
critical of Pinochet, said he believes the new, softer image is
prompted by opinion surveys which show a ``no'' vote prevailing in
the plebescite.
   He said it is aimed at winning over the substantial bloc of
voters who say they haven't yet decided how to vote.
   In Huneeus' most recent monthly opinion poll, conducted for an
institute run by the Academy of Christian Humanism, about 25
percent of those surveyed said they plan to vote yes. About 41
percent plan to reject the candidate. The rest said they are
undecided or don't plan to vote.
   Other polls by opposition-backed organizations show similar
results.
   Government-contracted polls show most people voting yes. But all
polls show about 30 percent of the public undecided, or at least
unwilling to admit their stance.
   Huneeus told the AP that softening Pinochet's image was ``like
trying to declaw a tiger'' and has not improved his standing in the
polls.
   ``This man's popularity isn't rising,'' he said. ``You can't
change your image overnight.''

   Winds spread dozens of fires covering over half a million acres
in northern Alaska and fanned a fire in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton
National Forest, spreading the blaze over about 12,000 acres by
Sunday afternoon.
   In California, a brush fire spread rapidly over tinder-dry
chaparral in Los Padres National Forest near San Luis Obispo,
blackening 600 acres and prompting a warning to residents that they
may have to evacuate.
   About 1,300 firefighters struggled against the wind to battle 45
blazes in northern Alaska, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Land
Management said. The fires had charred 554,884 acres by Sunday.
   About 340 firefighters controlled the north and south sides of a
117,000-acre fire at Alaska's Waring Mountain with the help of cool
weather and cloud cover, but the east and west sides continued to
burn out of control, said spokeswoman Sue Mitchell.
   A 152,600-acre fire north of Livengood was burning actively on
its north and south sides, but fire lines were holding, she said.
   In Selawik National Wildlife Refuge, a fire increased to 3,500
acres from 200 acres Saturday, Mitchell said. Another fire near the
refuge doubled to 2,000 acres, she said.
   About 300 firefighters struggled against the blaze in
Bridger-Teton National Forest, forest spokesman Dave Hohl said.
   The fire has grown rapidly since Saturday morning, when
firefighters began battling the blaze along its southern edge to
prevent risks to human life and property, he said. Firefighters had
allowed the fire to burn for five days before tackling its southern
end.
   No injuries or property damage has been reported, Hohl said.
   In Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming's northwest corner,
forest officials were continuing to allow eight fires covering more
than 10,000 acres to burn, but they imposed campfire restrictions
and closed some backcountry camping sites.
   One two-acre fire was supressed because it was caused by humans.
Officials allow only fires caused by nature to burn.
   Meanwhile, firefighters in eastern Wyoming were mopping up a
10,000-acre blaze in the Thunder Basin National Grasslands that
they controlled Saturday.
   In California, the fire in Los Padres National Forest began
about 12:15 p.m. Sunday and closed two mountain roads, said Kim
John, spokeswoman for the state Department of Forestry.
   ``We have asked residents in the Pozo area to be alert to the
situation and to evacuate if deemed necessary,'' said Ruth Wenstrom
of the U.S. Forest Service.
   About 400 firefighters were at the scene, and officials also
fought the blaze with seven air tankers and two helicopters.
   Forty miles to the south, another brush fire began about 12:30
p.m. and charred 40 to 50 acres, said Earl Clayton, spokesman for
the U.S. Forest Service.
   ``We feel we have it in pretty good shape,'' he said at 5 p.m.
   Another fire charred 20 acres of heavy brush near a development
of expensive homes in the Calabasas Highlands area, 30 miles west
of downtown Los Angeles. The blaze was surrounded within an hour of
its outbreak with no damage or injury reported, said Los Angeles
County firefighter Jim LaRue.
   The cause of all three fires was under investigation.
   At least 10 small lightning-caused range and forest fires were
burning in southeastern Montana Sunday. The area recorded 635
lightning strikes between 2 p.m. Saturday and 5:30 a.m. Sunday,
Bureau of Land Management spokesman Rob McWhorter said.

   A bus carrying Dominican musicians
swerved to avoid an ice cream cart and overturned, killing three
passengers and injuring 15, police said.
   Authorities identified two of the dead in Sunday's crash as
Jaime Emiro Andujar, a member of the popular ``Los Hijos del Rey''
(The King's Sons) merengue group; and Jose Pablo Diaz, a Venezuelan
security agent.
   A woman, whom police did not identify, was also killed.
   The musicians were traveling from the western city of Maracaibo
to Merida, in the Andes region, on a Venezuelan tour.
   Their bus with 35 passengers nearly hit the ice cream vendor as
he pulled his cart toward a small village near the road, swerved
and overturned, said local police officer Frank Carucci.
   Among the injured were brothers Juan and Freddy Valdez, also
members of ``Los Hijos del Rey,'' Carucci said in a telephone
interview from Lagunillas, 310 miles from Caracas.
   Members of the ``4:40'' band and singer Sergio Vargas, also
popular merengue performers, were uninjured.

   A man who burst into a home firing a shotgun
Sunday killed two people, shot two others in the head, raped a
woman and injured two other people, police said.
   Police said the rampage was drug-related, and that a warrant was
issued for a 28-year-old man in connection the crime and his
30-year-old brother for questioning.
   A fire had broken out at the home of the suspect earlier Sunday
morning, and police had subsequently found 9\ pounds of cocaine and
a little more than a pound of marijuana, said police Capt. Stanley
Puchalski. No one was injured in the fire, he said.
   About 5:30 a.m. Sunday, a young man called police and said he
was shot inside a house about a mile from the suspect's,
authorities said.
   Police who went to the home found a 36-year-old woman in a
bedroom dead of gunshot wounds in the back and leg and an
18-year-old man dead at the basement steps with a gunshot wound to
the back of the head, said Detective Warren Rosen.
   Authorities reported the ages based on tentative
identifications, but would not release names until the bodies were
positively identified.
   Officers found two survivors with shotgun wounds to the head, a
26-year-old man, and a man whose age was not available, Rosen said.
   A 13-year-old boy was beaten with the butt of a shotgun and a
16-year-old boy was shot in the right forearm, he said.
   A woman found on a nearby streetcorner said she had been beaten
with the butt of a gun and raped by the man who came into the house
shooting, Rosen said. She told police the man took her out of the
house and beat her and raped her, Rosen said.
   To protect the survivors, neither their names nor the hospitals
caring for them were being released, he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Science Successes Hide Bureaucratic Bumbling, Russian Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet style of government has handicapped
scientific research and there have been efforts to hide its
inadequacies behind showcased examples of success, a leading
Russian scientist says in an article published in a U.S. journal.
   Roald Z. Sagdeev, director of the Soviet Space Research
Institute and a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, says a
bureaucracy led by ``comically obtuse leaders'' with little
understanding of science has stifled Soviet research for decades
and left science there weak and unproductive.
   Sagdeev, writing in the quarterly journal, Issues in Science and
Technology, said the Soviets can be ``justly proud'' of
contributions to the study of the laser, the launching of Sputnik
and of subsequent achievements in space.
   But because of ``ill-conceived'' government policies, ``during
the past half century, Soviet science has suffered deep, and still
bleeding, wounds,'' said Sagdeev, who is a key science adviser to
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Exaggerated claims have been made for the achievements of
Soviet science,'' Sagdeev said. ``Science has its own criteria for
success, however, and Soviet achievements have not measured up to
them.''
   He said science has failed to strengthen industrial productivity
because ``we have not faced up to the real problem: Soviet
fundamental science is too weak to contribute much to practical
applications.''
   ``The shortcomings in Soviet science are apparent from the
subatomic world of physics to the boundless world of astronomy,''
he said. Soviet scientists, Sagdeev said, have contributed little
or nothing to the recent new discoveries in atomic physics, in
astronomy or in biology.
   A leading problem is that few Soviet scientists have access to
computers, Sagdeev said, while scientists in other countries use
them routinely. When the Soviets planned to send a satellite to
Halley's comet, scientists in the Soviet Space Research Institute
had to build a computer because such a machine is not made by
Soviet industry, he said.
   ``While researchers around the world are taking advantage of
these magnificent tools (computers), Soviet research workers and
engineers resemble soldiers attempting to fight a modern war with
crossbows,'' he said.
   He said since World War II, Soviet attempts at major science
projects have been increasingly dragged down by bureaucratic
machinery that smothers original research.
   Department barriers, he said, keep laboratory researchers from
communicating with students, thus handicapping the Soviet
production of new scientists.
   Bureaucrats attempted to apply central production planning
techniques to science research, said Sagdeev, often with ludicrous
results.
   ``In the 1960s, scientists even had to promise to achieve a
specific amount of progress within a designated period,'' he said.
Some physicists, ``recognizing the absurdity of the exercise,
pledged to make one discovery of worldwide importance, two
discoveries of all-Union importance and three ... of Siberian
importance to please political leaders at all levels.''
   While scientists, he said, saw this as nonsense, ``political
leaders can be comically obtuse.''
   ``French, German and American science is vibrant with new ideas,
while Soviet science is stultifying,'' he said.
   Sagdeev has published similar criticisms in Soviet publications.
   The National Academy of Sciences said Sagdeev wrote and
submitted the article for U.S. publication in Issues, which is
published by the academy, the National Academy of Engineering and
the Institute of Medicine.

   President Reagan is relaxing at his
California ranch while the Democratic Party installs Michael
Dukakis as its presidential nominee.
   Reagan, who already has made several speeches on behalf of the
GOP nominee-to-be, Vice President George Bush, plans an active role
in trying to keep the White House in Republican hands this fall.
   The president and his wife, Nancy, flew to their mountaintop
ranch from Washington on Sunday to spend a comfortable and quiet
week in the seclusion of the Santa Ynez Mountains while the
Democratic National Convention takes place in Atlanta.
   White House spokesmen have gone out of their way to sidestep
reporters' questions about whether Reagan will be following the
events in Atlanta. But Reagan left no doubt in his Saturday radio
address that he expects to hear much said there in criticism of his
policies.
   During the radio address, Reagan urged listeners to accept his
argument that he has steered the nation toward economic good times,
and cautioned Americans against accepting a bad-times message from
the Democrats.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan would spend
this week much like he has spent previous vacations at Rancho del
Cielo, mixing light paperwork with horseback riding and ranch
chores. Reagan may sign some congressional legislation while he is
in California.
   The Reagans will spend the week at the ranch, with no public
appearances scheduled, and will return to Washington next Sunday.
   Reagan has few major outings planned between now and mid-August,
when he will travel to New Orleans to appear at the opening session
of the Republican National Convention.
   The White House has said Reagan plans at least one
campaign-related appearance per week from Labor Day until Congress
adjourns, likely in the first week of October, and then will hit
the campaign stump twice a week on behalf of Bush and other
Republican candidates.

<HEAD>Senator Tries For Rare Comeback After Voters Rejected Him</HEAD>

   Slade Gorton says he lost his U.S. Senate
seat in 1986 because he didn't listen enough to the voters. Two
years later he's attempting a rare comeback, and he's all ears.
   ``All kinds of people ask why? Why did I lose that 1986
campaign?'' the 60-year Republican told his kickoff rally in
Spokane this spring. ``There are many answers, but the most
important can be reduced to a single, simple word: listening.
   ``One thing I pledge,'' he said. ``When I am taught a lesson, I
learn it well and for good.''
   Gorton, a former state attorney general and state House majority
leader, was one of several conservative Republican senators swept
into office by the Ronald Reagan landslide of 1980. He upset New
Deal Democrat Warren Magnuson by campaigning as a younger, more
vigorous and more fiscally conservative candidate.
   But six years later, Gorton was swept out, as disaffection with
the Reagan administration helped Democrats recapture the Senate. He
lost a close race to Brock Adams, a former congressman and
transportation secretary in the Carter administration.
   Gorton returned home to practice law, but he bounded back onto
the political scene in April, six months after Sen. Dan Evans, a
fellow Republican, made the surprise announcement that he would not
seek re-election.
   Evans, a former governor, was appointed to the Senate in 1983
after the death of Democrat Sen. Henry M. Jackson and won a special
election that year to complete Jackson's term.
   Chastened and eager to dispel an image of aloofness, Gorton said
his new efforts to listen more and talk less have led to a tougher
stance on fighting drugs and crime, a hold-the-line approach on
federal taxes, and a pledge not to tamper with Social Security
cost-of-living increases. He calls for the death penalty for some
drug pushers and opposes increases in personal taxes.
   He also has to contend with a strong pro-Pat Robertson faction
in the state GOP and a primay opponent, former White House aide
Doug Smith, who says Gorton is ``too liberal and does not represent
the Republican Party. He also is weak and indecisive.''
   Still, Gorton is the odds-on favorite to defeat Smith in the
Sept. 20 primary, and polls show him ahead of both of the Democrats
running that day: U.S. Rep. Mike Lowry of Seattle, who was defeated
by Evans in the special senatorial election, and U.S. Rep. Don
Bonker of Vancouver.
   ``I have tried to have an appeal to everyone from Robertson
Republicans to Scoop Jackson Democrats,'' he said. ``My support is
very, very broad.''
   He calls Bonker and Lowry ``very liberal liberals'' and says
that ``except for very minor differences, their actual message is
identical.
   ``They seem to be competing for the same 20 percent on the left,
and leaving most of the 80 percent in the rest of the political
spectrum to us.''
   If successful, Gorton would become only the sixth person in more
than 60 years to win a Senate race, then lose one, and then win
again, according to the Senate historian's office. The last senator
to do so was Chapman W. Revercomb, a Republican from West Virginia.
He won office in 1942, lost a re-election bid in 1948, lost again
in 1952, then won a special election in 1956 to complete the term
of Sen. Harley M. Kilgore, who died in office.
   More recently, Democrat Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio was
appointed to the Senate in 1973 to fill a vacancy when Republican
William B. Saxbe resigned to become attorney general under
President Nixon. Metzenbaum lost in the 1974 primary to John H.
Glenn Jr., but then won election to the Senate in 1976, ousting
Republican Robert Taft Jr.

   A heat wave that has baked cities along the
Yangtze River nearly all month has killed 290 elderly people in the
southern city of Nanchang and is endangering the crops of 5 million
people, newspapers reported.
   Sunday's editions of the Shanghai daily Wenhui Bao said
temperatures in Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi province, have hit 100
degrees every day this month.
   The paper, seen in Beijing today, said officials in the city of
about 1 million people have opened normally closed grassy areas and
underground shelters to help people seek relief from the heat.
   The daily also said that Shanghai hospitals have treated 1
million people for heat-related illnesses during the heat wave. It
said emergency centers have treated 40 percent more patients than
usual.
   The China Daily reported today that Shanghai's 12 million
residents have packed movie theaters and department stores, among
the few buildings with air-conditioning, as temperatures have
hovered between 95 and 100 degrees for 10 days.
   In neighboring Jiangsu province, temperatures over the past 10
days have ranged between 100 and 104 degrees, seriously endangering
crops in one of China's main grain-producing areas, the paper said.
   It said 1 million people in Jiangsu lack adequate drinking water
and 5 million people in drought-stricken areas are struggling to
save their crops.
   The daily earlier reported that 83 people died from the heat in
the provincial capital of Nanjing.
   It said high temperatures and humidity in Beijing have caused a
rapid growth of flies and mosquitoes, with malaria cases jumping
53.4 percent in the first 10 days of July. No figures were given.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Record On Issues Overshadowed By Credentials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Thornburgh, the attorney general
nominee, gained a reputation as a hard-liner on law enforcement
issues during his two terms as Pennsylvania governor, favoring the
death penalty and a tough stance on drugs.
   Thornburgh, who turned 56 on Saturday, had a mixed record on
abortion and a civil rights record one black leader termed
``indifferent.''
   As former U.S. attorney, former assistant attorney general and
two-term governor, Thornburgh has a full background on issues, but
none of them is expected to prove a stumbling block for quick
approval of Thornburgh's nomination.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is planning an early August
hearing on Thornburgh with a full Senate vote possible before
Congress recesses for three weeks after Aug. 12.
   Initial Capitol Hill reaction to his appointment has been
positive, with senators focusing not so much on Thornburgh's record
as on his credentials.
   The hearings are not expected to produce the fireworks that
surrounded consideration of Thornburgh's predecessor, Edwin Meese
III. Meese's conservative views, as well as ethical concerns voiced
by his critics, led to a 13-month confirmation fight that ended in
a 63-31 vote of approval by a Republican-controlled Senate in
February 1985.
   Thornburgh, a Yale graduate, was not touched by scandal during
his eight years in Harrisburg, Pa., ending in 1986. He remains
popular and has not ruled out another run for governor in 1990.
   But his tenure was not without controversy, and some of the
issues that made Pennsylvania headlines are likely to present
themselves in his new post.
   On civil rights, ``I certainly don't think you could put him in
the category of outstanding. He was indifferent,'' said Democratic
state Rep. Dwight Evans of Philadelphia, a member of the
Pennsylvania Legislature's black caucus.
   Caucus members complained of inaction by Thornburgh's
administration in the face of accusations of racial discrimination
by the state police in hiring and promoting black officers. In a
well-publicized case, a federal judge found in 1983 that
court-martial charges against a black state police lieutenant were
racially motivated.
   Evans said Thornburgh did not distinguish himself in hiring
blacks or helping minority businesses win state contracts. The
governor had two black cabinet members.
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a member of the Judiciary
Committee who has known Thornburgh for 22 years, said, ``He's been
very sensitive on civil rights issues. I think he's got a good
record on that.''
   On abortion, Thornburgh's appointment was criticized by Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who said, ``From the point of view of the
pro-life movement, the nomination is a bitter disappointment.''
   Actually, Thornburgh has a mixed record on abortion.
   In December 1981, he vetoed a restrictive abortion law, saying
he objected to a section that said life started as conception and
another that mandated a 24-hour waiting period. But in 1982,
Thornburgh signed a watered-down version of the bill that required
doctors to notify women about the risks of abortion and the
availability of medical assistance for prenatal care and childbirth.
   On prisoner paroles, Thornburgh ended the liberal policy of his
Democratic predecessor, Milton Shapp, of reducing sentences so
inmates could be eligible for parole.
   In Pennsylvania, a life sentence means exactly that unless
commuted by the governor. Even when it was recommended by the
Pardons Board, Thornburgh seldom commuted a sentence to permit
parole.
   Thornburgh's administration saw restoration of the death penalty
and he signed execution warrants for several convicted murderers,
but stays were granted by courts and the chair still has not been
used in the state for more than 20 years.
   As governor, Thornburgh signed a bill mandating a five-year
prison term for anyone convicted of using a gun during a crime and
supported efforts to provide tougher sentences for some
drug-related crimes.
   Thornburgh, typically cautious with the press, said at the White
House Tuesday that he could not answer substantive questions on
whether he would pursue an ethics investigation of Meese.
   In resigning, Meese said he was ``vindicated'' by an unreleased
independent counsel's report into his conduct that reportedly
recommends no criminal charges. Among other matters, the counsel
looked at Meese's assistance to Wedtech, a defense contractor under
investigation for alleged payoffs to win government contracts.

   Jesse Jackson on Sunday denounced as ``an
illusion'' the idea that nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis should
dominate the Democratic National Convention, saying ``this is not a
coronation,'' while the two sides agreed to meet Monday.
   As talks between the two campaigns continued, Jackson called on
his delegates to be disciplined for the four-day convention,
warning he might contest Dukakis every step of the way.
   ``If you have a quarter that was all smooth, it would be
counterfeit. There has to be some indentation and there has to be
some debate and deliberation to arrive at a consensus,'' Jackson
said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.''
   Jackson called Dukakis on Sunday morning for another private
telephone talk on the day the Massachusetts governor headed to
Atlanta.
   ``I did it to keep lines of communication open,'' Jackson told a
news conference in the afternoon.
   Dukakis confirmed the call, but neither man would reveal the
details.
   ``We talked on the telephone this morning,'' Dukakis said.
``We'll probably be talking a little later this evening, and I'm
sure we're going to be meeting during the course of the
convention.''
   Dukakis aides said the governor had scrapped at least part of
his Monday morning schedule, and later Dukakis spokesman Dayton
Duncan announced the two would meet privately Monday at 8:30 a.m.
at Dukakis' campaign hotel.
   Sources who asked not to be identified by name said that Dukakis
and Jackson were negotiating several issues, including Jackson's
demand to play a significant role in a transition effort in forming
a Democratic administration if Dukakis is elected in November.
Dukakis sources said it would be better to deal with the issue
after the election.
   These sources also said Jackson is seeking the right to appoint
two or three dozen at-large members to the Democratic National
Committee, a step that would increase his clout in the party
structure.
   Dukakis' rival also wants an agreement outlining an officially
sanctioned role in the fall campaign, including financial support
from Dukakis. It was not clear whether Jackson had explicitly asked
Dukakis to provide him with a charter jet of his own.
   A Dukakis source said the Dukakis camp would welcome campaign
efforts by Jackson, particularly in voter registration, but that
any funds would have to come from the party.
   In addition, the two sides were discussing unresolved platform
issues, although these did not appear to be the main stumbling
block toward a unity agreement.
   Dukakis was said to be insistent that party chairman Paul Kirk
remain in his post as long as he wants.
   Apart from the negotiations with Jackson, Dukakis was said to be
considering a plan to appoint a transition planning office in the
days immediately after he leaves Atlanta. One name mentioned as a
potential head of the effort was Marcia Hale, who has played a key
role in organizing the convention for the Massachusetts governor.
   ``There can be no final resolution until there is mutual trust
and respect and a feeling of comfort which can only grow from a
face-to-face meeting,'' said Jackson convention manager Ron Brown.
   ``We expect there will be a meeting. The time hasn't been
determined,'' said Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas after a
two-hour afternoon meeting with Jackson aides.
   California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a Jackson aide, said
the talks were proceeding in a ``pleasant'' vein.
   At a series of campaign stops across the convention city,
Jackson kept up the pressure on Dukakis.
   ``This is not a coronation. This is a convention,'' he told
several hundred cheering labor delegates in a sweltering hotel room
where the temperature topped 100 degrees.
   ``We're not threatening to leave the convention. We're talking
about threatening to stay,'' he told the delegates.
   Jackson made it clear that he is not ready simply to allow
Dukakis and his forces to have a smooth, debate-free convention
starting Monday.
   ``The fact is minority planks will be debated and deliberated
upon and decided by the convention,'' Jackson said. ``Our minority
planks are majority positions. For example, most Americans do not
want any more taxes on the middle class and poor people, but
corporations and the wealthy must pay their share.''
   Told that Dukakis doesn't want a call for higher taxes in the
platform and that ``It's supposed to be his convention,'' Jackson
quickly responded:
   ``That's an illusion. This is a convention of the people. It's
the delegates' convention. They will determine who the nominee will
be. They will determine what planks will be agreed upon.''
   At a Baptist church, Jackson vowed to press on.
   ``Our time is upon us now,'' he told more than 1,000 people at
the service. ``We're fighting the right fight. We've come a long
way. Don't you surrender. ... You cannot have new life without some
pain.''
   With the crowd, he chanted: ``Never surrender! Never surrender!''
   But he warned them to be mature and disciplined.
   ``Don't make Friday decisions on Sunday. Don't decide what
you're going to do until the votes are cast,'' he said.
   Dukakis called Jackson a valued member of the party's team, but
he made it clear in Boston who was headed for the Democratic
presidential nomination and who was not.
   ``You can't have two quarterbacks,'' Dukakis said.
   There was sense that an agreement needed to be reached quickly,
before the convention officially opens Monday night.
   ``Time is short. Our convention opens tomorrow,'' said Jackson
convention manager Brown.
   Kirk O'Donnell, a Dukakis adviser, added: ``Very definitely
there is an appreciation of a sense of urgency and there is a
desire for unity.''
   But Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's delegate in
Congress and a Jackson delegate, said, ``I think it has not yet
dawned on the Dukakis campaign how important it is that there be a
genuine partnership and shared responsibility for achieving
victory.''
   The candidates' words about each other were complimentary.
   ``We know each other, we like each other, we respect each
other,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Governor Dukakis and I have a good personal rapport. But there
are some unresolved matters,'' Jackson said. ``At this point, there
is no defined place for the progressive wing in the campaign. ...
At this point, no role has been offered or accepted or defined in
the campaign beyond Atlanta.''
   Even as Jackson suggested the fight could go on through the vice
presidential roll call on the convention's final night, he promised
the party would leave Atlanta unified for the fall campaign against
Republican George Bush.

   Atlanta police have undergone ``sensitivity
training'' to handle demonstrators at the Democratic National
Convention opening today, but they're equipped with $4,000 worth of
tear gas in case gentle persuasion doesn't work.
   Policing the convention will cost up to $4 million, most of it
for overtime pay for local officers. Part of the cost is being
defrayed by the federal government and Atlanta business interests.
   Half of the city's 1,400 policemen will be available for
convention duty.
   ``We can't always predict. We have to assume that someone will
try to do something and we have to try to minimize that
possibility,'' said Dick Murphy, head of the Democratic National
Committee's security advisory committee.
   Helicopters will monitor bus routes that the 5,372 delegates and
alternates will use to reach The Omni convention hall. The Secret
Service will check each of the 163 buses for hidden explosives.
   The Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service are
providing bodyguards for visiting governors and other dignitaries.
Specially selected detectives will investigate crimes against
convention delegates.
   Police are manning barriers a half-mile around the convention
hall, and will question anybody who wants to pass inside. People
with no business on the other side will be discouraged but not
prevented from entering, said Deputy Police Chief Willie Taylor.
   Municipal courts are geared to process minor offenders within
three hours of arrest. The American Civil Liberties Union is ready
to intervene in cases that may involve free speech issues with a
group of volunteer lawyers.
   Police say they have been told to do only what is necessary to
keep the peace and to make arrests as a last resort.
   At ``sensitivity training'' sessions, police have been coached
in how to deal with taunts and insults from demonstrators. State,
county and local police have received special training in
anti-terrorist tactics, arrest procedures and crowd control.
   Eugene Guerrero, head of the Georgia ACLU, said his organization
and the police had discussed how to handle demonstrators. ``We have
a good sense about the police here,'' he said.
   A two-acre parking lot facing The Omni has been set aside for
demonstrations, and groups from white supremacists to gay rights
advocates have signed up for two-hour slots between 9 a.m. and 11
p.m. Sunday through Thursday.
   The city will provide a stage and sound system and says any
group that talks beyond its allotted time will be unplugged.
   The subway stop for The Omni has been closed for the duration of
the convention. The estimated 100 freight trains that pass under
the convention complex each day will carry armed guards, and the
railroads have agreed not to haul hazardous materials.
   In May, the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management Agency
conducted drills on how to deal with 179 worst-case scenarios
ranging from a terrorist bombing to a subway accident or spill of
nuclear materials.
   Atlanta Police Maj. W.W. Holley said Atlanta does not rule out
large demonstrations and random disorders, but added: ``We will not
have a convention like they had in Chicago.'' The Democratic
convention in 1968 was marred by violent clashes between Chicago
police and thousands of anti-war demonstrators.

   The letter from Sarom Taing was fresh in her mind
as Kitty Dukakis stood at the gates of a Thai refugee camp, a guard
telling her the trip was in vain, that she would not be allowed in.
   ``The Vietnamese attacked Nong-Chan camp, where my brother is,''
Taing had told Mrs. Dukakis shortly before her 1985 trip to the
camp on the Thailand-Cambodia border. ``I fear that time is running
out and I do not know what to do.''
   Mrs. Dukakis fell to her knees, imploring the guard to let her
into the camp to search for the boy, Hout Pich.
   ``I think he was so thunderstruck by my doing that and knew I
wasn't going to get off my knees until he said yes,'' is her
recollection of the dramatic gesture that won her entrance to the
camp. The visit led to permission for Pich to come to the United
States.
   Pich graduated from high school this year and is off to college
in the fall. Mrs. Dukakis proudly displays his picture in the
living room of her Brookline home.
   She is both a political wife and political activist. She is a
trusted adviser to her husband Michael, the Massachusetts governor
and Democratic nominee-to-be. But she also has an agenda of her own.
   Mrs. Dukakis has an office in the Massachusetts Statehouse just
down the hall from her husband's, and from there has lent influence
to a variety of programs to assist refugees, Soviet dissidents and
Jews, the homeless and arts and environmental organizations.
   She relishes the prospect of taking her projects to the White
House.
   ``I think every first lady has a very different stamp to that
office, different responsibilities and interests,'' Mrs. Dukakis
said in a recent interview at her home. ``I see the role as one
just filled with opportunities and challenges. I would want to
continue my work with refugees, the homeless and also to continue
my lifelong involvement with the arts.''
   The latter commitment can be traced back to her upbringing in a
house rich in cultural interests. Her father, Harry Ellis Dickson,
is a former violinist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra who was
later the associate conductor of the Boston Pops. In addition, Mrs.
Dukakis has for 30 years been a student and teacher of modern dance.
   She traces her desire to work on behalf of refugees and Soviet
Jews back to her parents as well. Both are Jewish, met while
studying in Berlin and returned to the United States as Hitler came
to power. There was frequent talk of the Holocaust as Kitty grew up.
   She smiles when reminded that, if her husband is elected
president, that she would be the first Jewish first lady.
   ``I feel a great deal of pride in my ethnic and religious
background,'' she said.
   Delicate spinal surgery forced her off the campaign trail in
June, but she recovered ahead of schedule and looks forward to
resuming campaigning after this week's Democratic National
Convention, where her husband will accept the party's presidential
nomination.
   To some, the Dukakises seem like an odd couple _ she with her
flair for the dramatic and taste for the finer things, and he known
for caution and frugality. But they are, as one longtime family
friend put it, like ``teen-agers in love.''
   Mrs. Dukakis was a freshman at Brookline High School when her
husband was a senior. They knew of each other but never met.
Ironically, they were introduced years later by Sandy Bakalar, who
dated Dukakis in high school.
   That was in 1961, shortly after Mrs. Dukakis divorced her first
husband and moved back to Brookline with her 3-year-old son, John.
   ``I liked Michael very much from the beginning,'' she said. ``He
already was talking about entering politics and I saw in him
someone with courage and compassion, a commitment to people and
programs that help people.''
   They were married in 1963 and recently celebrated their 25th
anniversary. They have two daughters, Andrea, 22, and Kara, 19. Son
John took the Dukakis name altough he has never been legally
adopted by the governor.
   All have been active in the campaign.
   Part of Mrs. Dukakis' campaign pitch is her story about her
26-year addiction to amphetamines, which she ended by seeking
treatment in 1982 but did not disclose until last year. She has
been trying to quit smoking for years, sneaking off during campaign
appearances to have a cigarette out of her husband's view.
   Dukakis calls himself a ``doer,'' a word used frequently by Mrs.
Dukakis' associates when asked to describe her efforts. Her
activism has won widespread praise _ tempered with
characterizations of her as sometimes arrogant and overly
aggressive.
   She rejects such notions.
   ``I prefer the word determined,'' she said. ``I find it
interesting that I never hear the word aggressive used to describe
men who are aggressive. I'm a strong person and I feel very
determined to get done what I set out to do.''

<HEAD>City Cancels March Of White Supremacists To Avoid Violence</HEAD>

   Helmeted police with riot shields pushed back
opponents of a white supremacist rally that authorities canceled to
avoid ``blood in the streets of Atlanta'' on the eve of the
Democratic National Convention.
   Despite some shoving and tense encounters in the broiling heat,
there was no violence and no charges were filed as protesters
chanted anti-police and anti-Ku Klux Klan slogans, and burned an
American and a Confederate flag.
   Through it all worshippers at Central Presbyterian Church, which
faces the Capitol steps where the rally was to have been, peered in
their Sunday finery through closed glass doors at all the fuss
outside.
   ``This was a hostile, angry, nasty crowd and that's why we
canceled the march,'' said Public Safety Commissioner George Napper.
   ``It was a tough call because this is America,'' he said, but
said he was determined to avoid ``blood in the streets of Atlanta.''
   The Mississippi-based Nationalist Movement had planned to rally
on the steps of the gold-domed State Capitol then march to a
parking lot across the street from The Omni, the site of the
convention, for a demonstration.
   But police said they could not guarantee the safety of the
Klan-style group of about 150 whose leader, Richard Barrett, later
was taken into protective custody.
   The city has set aside the two-acre parking lot for
demonstrations and parceled out two-hour time slots for the
duration of the convention.
   Twenty people showed up as the Coalition to Support Cuban
Detainees held the first of the scheduled protests, which began on
Sunday.
   The Mad Housers, a homeless relief group based in Atlanta, built
a small red, white and blue hut as an example of the structures
they put up for homeless people.
   About 120 people marched from nearby Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium to the protest zone to demonstrate against Ethiopian
control of that country's Eritrean province.
   The Nationalist Movement marchers were to have come from the
stadium to march from the Capitol to the convention site, but
remained at the stadium. Only Barrett and a man with a cap reading
``Thank God For AIDS'' were on the Capitol steps.
   The front of the Capitol was roped off, confining some 500
anti-racism protesters to either end of the street in front of it.
As temperature shot past 90 degrees, the sweltering police in heavy
black riot gear tried to ignore chants linking them to the Klan.
   The protesters, representing no one group, chanted such slogans
as ``No KKK, no Fascist USA,'' and ``quit your jobs, quit your
jobs, quit your racist jobs.''
   Gene Guerrero, the chairman of the Georgia chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, called the decision to cancel the
march ``a shameful act on the part of the city.''
   Later about 250 of the counter-demonstrators marched to the
protest zone chanting ``We just took the Klan's march.''
   Convention security spokeswoman Jackie Barrett said Barrett, no
relation, was taken into protective custody when he entered the
protest zone.
   A small group of his backers tried to march to the protest zone
despite the cancellation. The counter-demonstrators surrounded them
but police separated the two groups before there was any violence
and took the supremacists away in a bus. Police said they were not
arrested.
   In other demonstrations:
   _ LEGAL, a gay rights group, pressed for more efforts to cure
AIDS and for an end to discrimination against homosexuals. Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a sponsor of major AIDS funding
legislation, addressed the crowd of about 2,000.
   _ Radio personality Casey Kasem was among the speakers for
Compassion Campaign '88, an animal rights group promoting
legislation to outlaw steel-jawed leg traps, use of ``veal cages''
that hold calves immobile to keep their flesh tender, and some
chemical tests on animals.
   _ The Cuban support group protested what organizers said was an
Immigration and Naturalization Service review process that was much
too slow. The process was developed following riots by some 3,800
Cuban detainees last December at federal penitentiaries in Atlanta
and in Oakdale, La.

   National political conventions have become such
made-for-TV events that the chairman of the Democratic National
Committee openly refers to his party's gathering this week as a
four-part mini-series.
   ``You never get a second chance to make a first impression,''
says DNC Chairman Paul Kirk.
   The most imposing features of the new Omni convention hall, a
sports arena reborn as the birthplace of the 1988 Democratic
ticket, are its two dozen-plus TV skyboxes and an enormous tiered
camera platform closer to the podium than ever before.
   Television used to adore political conventions because they were
full of conflict and color. But once the parties realized they were
on display, they strove for tranquility above all. Snore, said the
networks, and limited coverage this year to two hours nightly.
   Now organizers have a new challenge: how to make a lively,
lengthy and essentially harmonious gathering as compressed and
compelling as ``Roots'' or ``Taipan.''
   From 9 to 11 p.m., Kirk said, ``we are going to have to be jam
up and jelly tight to get everything we want in there.''
   He and other party leaders have been playing to the prime-time,
living-room viewer since preparations began.
   When the party selected the Omni, ``we looked at this hall as a
television studio,'' Kirk said. And that is how it has been remade
_ as a temporary set for a four-day pageant, less suspenseful than
an afternoon quiz show but brimming with patriotism and spectacle.
   To the naked eye, the wooden podium is rough-hewn and the red,
white or blue slipcovers on the delegates' folding chairs are loose
and shabby. But both are effective on television, as seen by five
rows of cameras stationed 66 feet from the podium _ the same
distance as in a large TV studio.
   They may have cut back their programming, but ABC, CBS and NBC
still dominate the arena with their enormous glass skyboxes.
Equally large is the box occupied by CNN, the Atlanta-based cable
network which is providing much more extensive coverage.
   Some two dozen other skyboxes for smaller stations and groups
also ring the Omni, jutting out over clumps of delegate seats and a
special niche cut high on the wall to hold the miles of cable that
are the media's lifeline.
   Underneath the podium, speakers are primped and primed by
make-up experts and TelePrompTer coaches before an escort takes
them up a narrow stairway to the rostrum. The objective:
eliminating for the viewer the distractions an uncomfortable novice
might offer.
   ``It's a fact of life,'' says Mike Sheehan, the head coach.
``Most people are going to be seeing this on a 19{-inch box.''
   Speakers emerging from the subterranean maze of holding and
preparation rooms will be shifting their gazes from left to right,
where their speeches will be rolling by on two TelePrompTer
mirrors. For special effect, to underline their most dramatic or
important lines, they'll stare straight ahead at those rows of
cameras _ and hope their memories don't fail them.
   Lights will warn speakers that their time is almost up. ``No
whoopee cushions,'' promises Sheehan. A pneumatic lift will help
minimize height differences _ for instance, the gap between the
5-foot-8 Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, his 6-foot-2 running mate.
   Behind the scenes, the DNC is mounting ``one of the most
sophisticated and elaborate press operations ever put together for
a national political gathering,'' according to an overview written
by the DNC press office itself.
   Direct services to the media range from distribution of a press
survival kit complete with a free subway pass and a packet of
aspirin, to a network news liaison charged with locating quotable
Democrats for harried television reporters and programmers.
   The DNC is also operating both audio and electronic ``Party
Lines'' to transmit convention press releases, speeches and
schedules, and a Convention Satellite News Service with hours of
interviews, speeches and pre-packaged programs available to TV
stations across the country as well as the hundreds actually in
Atlanta.
   ``The modern convention is an opportunity above all else to
communicate a message,'' says DNC spokesman Mike McCurry. That is
to say, as the DNC overview put it, ``a strong and positive message
about our nominee and our plan for America.''

<HEAD>She's Been Calling the Roll Since Roosevelt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first time Dorothy Bush called the roll at a
Democratic National Convention in 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt was
nominated for his fourth term.
   Since then, she has tallied the votes for and against Harry
Truman, Adlai Stevenson (twice), John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson,
Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, Jimmy Carter (twice) and Walter
Mondale. This week, she'll do it for Michael Dukakis, too.
   Dorothy Bush is that nice lady with the soft southern accent who
becomes a media star every four years when she sings out ``Alabama
_ 65 votes'' and runs through the list, past Wyoming to Puerto
Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and Americans Abroad.
   It's her most visible job as secretary of the Democratic Party.
Now 71, she was the first woman ever elected as an officer of
either the Democratic or Republican party and has been re-elected
with little or no opposition at the reorganization meetings that
follow the national convention. She expects there won't be any
problem next Friday either.
   On Sunday, a day for rehearsing and microphone checks, Dorothy
Bush was on the podium putting the states through their paces.
   ``Madame Chairman, Michigan is happy to be here,'' boomed a
voice from her far left.
   ``So are we,'' said Mrs. Bush. ``So are we.'' She sounded as if
she meant it.
   ``This is my 12th convention,'' said Mrs. Bush afterward. ``I
want these people to know I'm glad they are here. The personal
touch is important.''
   The amount of television time devoted to Mrs. Bush is tied
directly to the problems that arise. The more problems, the more
roll calls, the more Dorothy Bush.
   ``The smoother it goes, the better I like it,'' she says.
   The biggest change in those 48 years has been the increased
presence of women in the delegation, she says. And she finds that
gratifying.
   There's also been a change in numbers. In 1944 there were 1,176
votes to count. This year there are 4,162.
   In her job, she says, a sense of humor helps.
   One year, the Puerto Rico delegation answered her call with
``Puerto Rico casts siete votes for ...'' She doesn't remember the
candidate.
   Says Mrs. Bush, ``I answered `Puerto Rico casts siete votes'.
Even though I don't speak Spanish, I know siete means seven.''

   John Cox puts words in the mouths of politicians,
and he can just as easily take them out.
   Cox may have one of the most pressure-packed and powerful jobs
of all at the Democratic National Convention: running the
TelePrompTer, the computer-driven gizmo that projects words onto
glass plates so politicos can deliver speeches without burying
their faces in text.
   One slip of the hand, and Cox, a prompter operator, could leave
a presidential candidate, well, speechless.
   ``It's a big responsibility and you have to remain calm when
everyone around you is screaming,'' said Cox, who will be
positioned down a steep, shoulder-width staircase in the bowels of
the podium.
   When the speech is in progress, the operator controls the flow
of words with a computer game-type knob _ kind of like Presidential
Pacman. Precision is the key: only about 18 words at a time appear
on the glass, which is about the size of a 19-inch television
screen.
   ``You've got to keep going with them,'' Cox said. ``You take the
pace off the speaker. How well it works really depends on how much
time you've had to rehearse and whether they go off the script.''
   Cox's Los Angeles-based company, Computer Prompting Services,
has more experience projecting words at the Academy and Grammy
awards ceremonies. The big difference here, he said, is the
magnitude of debate _ some 36 hours worth of words over the
four-day affair.
   ``The shear volume of material has made this into a tough job,''
he said.
   A speech may not arrive at the TelePrompTing cavern until an
hour before it's to be delivered. It's fed into the computer, which
handles the projecting.
   Last-minute changes are common. And the operators have to
rehearse with the speakers to calibrate their rhythm and discuss
the probability of departing from the text.
   ``I don't get nervous. I've done this a lot,'' Cox said.
   And if something goes wrong with millions of people watching ...
it's back to good 'ole paper.
   ``We have someone on the podium reading along who can hand copy
to the speaker,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Eyeing Jackson Aides For State Campaign Posts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senior advisers to Michael Dukakis say several
aides to Jesse Jackson are likely to be appointed to state
leadership posts for Dukakis' prospective presidential campaign,
possibly before the Democratic National Convention ends Thursday.
   Top Dukakis aides discussed campaign strategy for this fall
against Republican George Bush at a meeting Sunday with 35 of the
apparent Democratic nominee's state directors.
   Another session was planned for Thursday. If unresolved disputes
with the rival Jackson camp are settled by then, Dukakis officials
hope to announce that several Jackson operatives have agreed to
join the Dukakis campaign as state directors and deputy directors.
   ``He's got some very good field organizers,'' said Dukakis field
director Charlie Baker, who arranged the meeting. ``My view is that
we can take a great step toward winning by aggressively recruiting
these folks. I expect a number of my important field staff to come
from the Jackson campaign.''
   Baker and other officials refused to divulge names, but several
sources close to Dukakis said the prospective appointees include
key organizers in some states where Jackson won primaries and
caucuses.
   Jackson won in several Southern states where Dukakis hopes to
surprise Bush, including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
South Carolina and Virginia.
   Jackson also won in Michigan, but Dukakis already has named a
state director there.
   Jack Corrigan, director of operations for Dukakis, said the
state directors were promised that Dukakis would commit the
necessary resources to be competitive in all 50 states.
   ``Gov. Dukakis is fully committed to a 50-state campaign,''
Corrigan said.
   Said another senior aide, Kirk O'Donnell: ``We are poised for
truly a national campaign and a national victory.''
   Baker, a veteran of Dukakis' state campaigns, said several
longtime aides to Dukakis' designated vice presidential running
mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, also were expected to join the
Dukakis operation in Texas. That campaign is headed by Tom
Cosgrove, who was state director for Dukakis' successful primary
efforts there and in New Jersey.
   Other aides attending the Sunday meeting with state directors
included Susan Estrich, the Dukakis campaign manager; Joseph
Warren, campaign secretary; Donna Brazile, a deputy field director
who worked for Jackson in 1984, and Robert Farmer, chief
fund-raiser.

   Michael Dukakis put a difficult chapter in his
presidential campaign behind him by signing legislation closing the
state's books on the last fiscal year and scaling down this year's
budget.
   ``Whatever happens to me in November,'' the governor and
prospective Democratic presidential nominee said Sunday, ``I want
this state of ours to continue to build its reputation for fiscal
responsibility and fiscal restraint.''
   The bill signed by Dukakis before he left for the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta closed a $446 million revenue
shortfall in the state budget from the past fiscal year and cut or
delayed $225 million in spending for the new year.
   The troubled state finances were an embarrassment for Dukakis,
who has promoted himself in his presidential campaign as a sound
fiscal manager.
   The $11.6 billion state budget for fiscal 1989, which began July
1, is Dukakis' 10th and potentially last as governor. The budget is
supported by a series of tax increases on corporations, cigarette
smokers and personal investors, increases in court fees and traffic
fines and the use of lottery surpluses destined for cities and
towns.
   Closing out fiscal 1988 was accomplished largely by bond
borrowing to pay for building maintenance, local highways and other
projects that were slated to be paid in cash. The governor also
tapped $27 million in state employee pension surpluses.
   ``As we have been saying for the last four months, we will
finish '88 with a modest surplus and we've done that,'' said
Administration and Finance Secretary Frank Keefe. ``So we are
absolutely tickled pink.''
   But some administration watchers doubted that the state's
financial picture was quite so secure.
   ``After the election, then there is going to be a fiscal crisis
and then you are going to see tax increases, major tax increases,''
said Barbara Anderson of Citizens for Limited Taxation, an advocacy
group that promoted a state tax cap resulting in a rebate to
taxpayers last year.
   Human services advocate Deborah Weinstein said the fiscal 1989
budget poses ``a strong risk that we can't provide this year's
level of services'' for legal services for the poor and various
health services for the disabled, children and adults.
   But Dukakis said his fiscal 1989 budget plan contains ``no
cutbacks in services and we will continue to expand in certain
important areas.''
   The revenue problems for fiscal 1988 were twofold _ a sharp drop
blamed by the administration on federal tax changes in capital
gains, and a lawsuit lost by the administration to prevent
corporations from using out-of-state losses to reduce in-state
income.
   The lawsuit will cost the state $92 million alone _ half of
which Dukakis will pay off in fiscal 1988 and the other half in
fiscal 1989.
   Dukakis maintains that the revenue drop, following a $400
million budget surplus in fiscal 1987, was unforeseen but is
temporary.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo stole the show when the
Democratic National Convention opened four years ago, but will
watch from the sidelines tonight when his party convenes its 1988
meeting.
   Cuomo, who delivered a stirring keynote address to the 1984
convention, is to lead the New York delegation into The Omni
tonight to hear Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards deliver the
opening speech.
   While Cuomo is the titular head of the New York delegation _ the
convention's second largest _ he will play no formal role at the
gathering.
   In fact, Cuomo's not even chairman of the New York delegation, a
job that's being handled by his hand-picked state Democratic
chairman Laurence Kirwan.
   Cuomo has said that part of the reason he can't play a bigger
role at the convention, at least within the New York delegation, is
that he has to be in Albany to attend to state business.
   He planned to be back at the state Capitol on Tuesday and then
to return to Atlanta on Wednesday for the nomination of Michael
Dukakis, Cuomo political aide John Marino said Sunday.
   Four years ago, the national convention had a stronger New York
flavor.
   Cuomo delivered the keynote, then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of
Queens was the vice presidential nominee and New York City Mayor
Edward Koch also spoke.
   This year, neither Cuomo nor Koch helped themselves much when it
came to getting plum convention assignments. Cuomo, refusing until
just before the New York primary to end speculation that he might
be interested in the nomination for himself, stayed neutral until
all the primaries were over.
   For his part, Koch did take sides in the New York primary _
against Jesse Jackson. Backing Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, Koch
said that Jews would have to be ``crazy'' to vote for Jackson.
   Cuomo saved himself some possible political embarrassment by
telling national party chief Paul Kirk well before convention
assignments were handed out that he didn't want a formal role. Koch
decided to go to Ireland with New York's Cardinal O'Connor while
the convention is on.

   It isn't basketball, but tonight's prime-time
game live from The Omni is sure to see just as many elbows and
inside moves.
   ``I think it's going to be awful,'' said NBC reporter Lisa Myers
as she considered the prospect of grabbing delegates and
politicians for floor interviews during the four nights of the
Democratic National Convention starting today.
   ``It looks like it's going to be absolute murder,'' said ABC's
Brit Hume.
   Two of The Omni arena would fit into the Moscone Center in San
Francisco where the 1984 Democratic convention was held. Not only
is The Omni much smaller, but the massive podium and camera
platform built for the occasion eat up a lot of the maneuvering
room for reporters down in the fray.
   A floor reporter's job necessarily entails getting from one
state delegation to another across the hall, sometimes on a
moment's notice. At most convention sites, there is an outer
corridor just off the floor where reporters can rush around to the
other side.
   Not at The Omni. Getting across the floor will mean pushing
through the masses.
   ``Within about the first 30 minutes, I think we can anticipate
gridlock,'' said Myers.
   Bill Plante of CBS said he was ``more worried about getting a
story than getting crushed.'' He considers his assignment a choice
one, putting him close to large contingents of Jesse Jackson
supporters in the Michigan and California delegations.
   ``I think there'll be action. I don't know how hard it's going
to be to move around and cover it. But sharp elbows are tools of
the trade,'' he said.
   ``No question about it, the hall has been turned into a
television studio,'' Plante said. ``But we still have to find the
actors in the drama there.''
   Hume wondered what would happen if there were a law against
network reporters using the term ``make our way'' during a
convention. ``We'd come to a complete standstill,'' he said. ``We
never just go somewhere at a convention. We `make our way.' I guess
we're going to `make our way' with difficulty through this
convention.''
   Not only will it be crowded, but all the television lights will
make it hot.
   And it will be noisy. A blaring orchestra will make it difficult
for floor reporters to hear instructions from control booths in the
trailers behind the hall.
   ``The only thing worse than being here,'' said Hume, ``is not
being here.''

   C-SPAN plans to carry uninterrupted live coverage of the
convention sessions, beginning at 6:30 p.m. EDT. CNN will cover the
entire convention, interspersed with commentary and interviews. The
big three networks plan two hours of prime-time coverage, 9-11 p.m.
   The Democratic National Committee has the convention planned
down to the minute to take full advantage of that exposure.
Tonight's preview promises all the comedy, drama and pathos of
regular prime time.
   The keynote address will be delivered by Texas State Treasurer
Ann Richards, a witty, effective speaker who's getting her big
chance on national TV.
   The National Anthem will be sung by radio personality and author
Garrison Keillor, who will later read letters from children that
begin, ``If I were president.'' Then, former President Jimmy Carter
will deliver his speech, the first time he has addressed his party
since he lost the presidency in 1980.
   So what was deemed not exciting enough for prime time? Here are
the activities that C-SPAN will carry live that the networks won't:
   The invocation, the National Anthem performed by the Marine Drum
and Bugle Corps, remarks by the chairman of the Georgia Democratic
Party, a salute to the convention CEO, the welcome by a Fulton
County official, the credentials report, the rules report, the
opening roll call, the election of House Speaker Jim Wright as
convention chairman, the election of co-chairs, the appointment of
parliamentarian, sergeant at arms and doorkeeper.
   Plus remarks by: the vice chairs, the treasurer, the finance
chair, the Victory Fund chair, the Dukakis national finance chair,
the host committee co-chairs; introductions of former Speakers Carl
Albert and Thomas P. O'Neill and former Vice President Walter
Mondale; welcoming remarks by Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young,
Washington Gov. Booth Gardner and Detroit Mayor Coleman Young.
   The convention, if still on schedule by then, is supposed to
recess for 20 minutes until prime time begins.

   Television audience levels for the convention have been in a
steady decline since 1976.
   In 1980, the three-network average rating for common coverage
was a 9.0. In 1984, it dropped to a 7.7.
   The highest rating for the Democrats' convention was Chicago
1968, when the three-network average was a 12.9.
   The rating is a percentage of the number of U.S. households with
television sets, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co., which revises
the estimate each year. Currently the number is 88.6 million.
   Only ABC would venture a prediction of the number of viewers who
will tune in all or part of any network coverage _ about 96
million. That's about a 7 percent drop from 1984.

   Words of support and shouts of outrage rippled
around the world as thousands of people marked the birthday of
Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid leader who turned 70 today in a
South African jail.
   Celebrations ranging from rock concerts to church services were
planned today in at least 30 countries. In South Africa, the
white-led government has banned events related to Mandela's
birthday.
   Dozens of nations have in recent days demanded the release of
Mandela, who has been jailed for nearly 26 years.
   Britain's Anti-Apartheid Movement, which organized a prayer
service for Mandela today at St. James Church in London, said 25
activists marched 590 miles from Glasgow, Scotland, to deliver to
the South African Embassy here more than 30,000 cards signed by
Britons calling for Mandela's release.
   A music festival starring Mark Knopfler of the rock group Dire
Straits was planned for tonight in the racially mixed south London
suburb of Brixton, the organization said.
   Anti-apartheid activities were planned in at least 30 countries,
including the United States, Japan, India, Cuba, East and West
Germany, Nigeria and Venezuela, it said.
   On Sunday, tens of thousands of demonstrators thronged London's
Hyde Park for a pro-Mandela rally. Similar gatherings were held in
Amsterdam and Rome.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was among dozens of
government leaders who sent birthday messages.
   ``It distresses one to realize that you mark the birthday in a
prison dungeon into which you were thrown by the racists more than
a quarter of a century ago,'' Gorbachev said in a telegram Sunday.
   At the London rally, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu
declared Mandela to be ``head and shoulders above any contemporary
leader in South Africa.
   ``Any sensible government would realize that Nelson Mandela is
absolutely essential for peace and stability in southern Africa,''
he said.
   The mostly young, white crowd roared with approval as the face
of Mandela's wife, Winnie, flashed on a giant video screen. In a
taped message, she expressed thanks ``to the entire international
community'' for seeking her husband's release.
   ``We are very moved, very touched, by this gesture,'' she said.
   In Toronto, thousands rallied on the grounds of the Ontario
legislature to mark Mandela's birthday. In Montreal, about 600
gathered in Nelson Mandela Park to dance and listen to music and
speeches.
   Mandela was among eight African National Congress leaders
sentenced to life imprisonment on June 11, 1964, for sabotage and
conspiracy to topple the government.
   He is in Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, and President P.W.
Botha's government has refused repeated international appeals for
his release, saying he must first publicly disavow violence.
   South African diplomat Justus de Goede, the second-ranking
official at the London Embassy, said in a radio interview that the
guerrilla group was committed to the violent overthrow of the
government and noted that bomb and grenade attacks by the
organization guerrillas were increasing.
   ``I think it is asking a great deal of any government to
knowingly release the leader of an organization which has this
political manifesto into society without some sort of guarantee,''
de Goede said.
   The outlawed guerrilla group has waged a sabotage and bombing
campaign since 1961 aimed at undermining the government and ending
apartheid, the system of racial separation that enables South
Africa's 5 million whites to dominate the 26 million blacks
politically and economically.

<DATELINE>BIG PINE KEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gentle Key deer who inhabit the
Florida Keys are so cute it's killing them.
   Emboldened by handouts from well-meaning residents, many of the
   Bambi-esque creatures have been run over by cars while crossing
highways in search of food.
   The smallest species of white-tailed deer in the nation, the
endangered animals roam among the ever-increasing houses on this
island, nibbling roots, homeowners' plants and flowers _ and
begging for snacks.
   ``A few days ago, a young one was eating our tomatoes. I went
out to take its picture and he trotted up to me for a handout,''
said island resident Grace Manillo.
   ``They'll sit there and be cute and beg for food. They'll eat
anything. It's the deers' undoing _ you can love them to death,''
added Deborah Holle, manager of the National Key Deer Refuge.
   The deer, about 2 feet tall and 70 pounds when full grown, will
even munch marshmallows and potato chips, said Holle.
   ``We have one herd fed junk food daily. We noticed two of them
with the worst coats we've ever seen.''
   But poor coats are the least of the deer's troubles. Dogs and
wild pigs maul them. About a fifth of all newborns drown in ditches
dug years ago to control mosquitoes. They lack sufficient fresh
water. Development is whittling away their habitat outside the
7,400-acre federal refuge. And the handouts make them lose their
savvy, becoming easy prey for poachers.
   The handouts, which are illegal, have a more insidious effect:
They make the deer bold enough to cross busy streets to reach
houses where they can count on snacks.
   Between 1980 and 1987, 345 of the 431 deer found dead on Big
Pine Key and the several neighboring keys they also inhabit were
killed by cars.
   Cars killed all but eight of the 31 found dead so far this year,
prompting Holle to spend $20,000 from the refuge budget for extra
Monroe County Sheriff's deputies to ticket speeders on nearby
roads. But she fears more of her 250 precious wards may soon die on
the highway.
   Compounding the problem is a controversial road first proposed
in 1985 to siphon off traffic from often-clogged U.S. 1, the main
drag through this island. The road would cut through prime
deer-roaming territory, and is opposed by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge; the Florida Game and
Freshwater Fish Commission and local environmentalists.
   But area residents overwhelmingly favor the road so they can
avoid U.S. 1, and say objections to the route come too late.
   ``The route was published in newspapers. We followed the county
attorney's advice. We picked a route able to move people in the
most efficient way with the least disruption to the environment.
Now people are yelling, `Key deer!''' said Bill Becker, who founded
the committee that drew up the highway plan.
   Said Mrs. Manillo: ``We need a bypass road, but I'm not
convinced that's the place to put it. But some say people are more
important than the deer, and get annoyed. They are inconvenienced
by the deer.''
   Holle said the deer have always struggled. ``It was never a
garden of Eden here. They had storms, and fresh water was probably
the biggest limiting factor.''
   The refuge was established in 1957 to save the 50 deer that
remained then. In 1967, the deer received endangered species
protection, and by 1978, the population grew to about 400. Now it's
dwindling again, mostly because of development that destroys
habitat and brings cars, says Holle, who spends $2 million a year
to add land to the refuge.
   But she fears her efforts may not save the deer from extinction.
   ``They have a very low reproductive rate,'' says Holle. She also
views the proposed road as a deer death trap.
   Mrs. Manillo agreed.
   ``The deer run right out into traffic,'' she said. ``People
speed. The deer kills go on and on and on.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
lashed out today at South Korea's unwillingness to open its markets
to American exports, saying that if his statements spark
anti-Americanism then ``so be it.''
   ``It's got to work both ways, if it's going to work,'' he said
in urging a free market flow of goods between the two nations.
Washington regards trade as lopsided in Seoul's favor.
   Speaking to the Korean Newspaper Editors Association, Shultz
also said Washington will support efforts by South Korea at
reconciliation with communist North Korea, but stands ready to
repel any attack from what he described as a menacing, terrorist
state.
   In a prepared speech, Shultz praised the recent progress of
democracy in South Korea, but offered sharp criticism of the
nation's economic policies in a following question-and-answer
session.
   ``If my statement causes anti-Americanism so be it. I'm going to
stand up for the principles I believe in,'' Shultz said.
   He accused South Korea of failing to open its markets to
American beef and citrus fruit imports despite a 3-year-old
agreement to do so.
   ``Sometimes it seems to us that everyone wants the U.S. market
to be open and that's as far as it goes. That's not an open world
trading system. It's got to be reciprocal,'' the secretary said.
   Anti-American sentiment in South Korea has increased because of
public resentment of U.S. pressure to open Korean markets to
imports.
   Koreans claim they are a developing nation and their young
economy must be protected despite its enormous trade surplus.
   South Korea's dynamic economic growth has been fueled by exports
to the United States. The trade deficit last year was about $10
billion in Seoul's favor.
   Shultz said lack of market access for U.S. imports has created
some domestic political problems in the United States.
   ``You think we don't have farmers who notice that they can't
penetrate other peoples' markets and they don't raise Cain?''
Shultz said. ``Have you ever seen the tractors on the streets of
Washington protesting closed markets abroad?''
   The normally low-key Shultz answered questions about South
Korea's economic policies with unusual force and intensity.
   Trade problems are expected to also loom large in Japan,
Shultz's eighth stop in a nine-country tour of East Asia and the
Pacific.
   Shultz was to fly to Tokyo later today after talks with South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo. Earlier, he met with members of South
Korea's main political parties, including opposition leaders and
Foreign Minister Choi Kwang-soo.
   In his speech, Shultz called on North Korean leaders to
``rethink the severe restrictions they imposed on the lives of
their citizens'' and liberalize their rigid communist economy.
   ``Even as we support the efforts of our ally in the south to
promote dialogue and national reconciliation, we will also stand
firm in the face of violence and threats to intimidate,'' he said.
   ``America's resolve to help our Korean ally ... repel aggression
from the north is as firm now as when we signed our mutual defense
treaty in 1953,'' Shultz said. The United States has about 42,000
troops in the south.
   Shultz said Washington would carefully study North Korean
actions before moving toward contacts with Pyongyang. He said it
was ``premature'' to consider opening trade ties between the two
nations.
   Shultz said that if North Korea staged a terrorist attack during
the the Olympic Games in Seoul, which open in September, it would
``be an aggression against the whole world ... the whole world will
be watching.''

<HEAD>NASA Delays Decision On Removing Space Shuttle From Launch Pad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discovery's tiny fuel leak has been
stopped but not fixed, and officials have decided to test-fire the
ship's three main engines before deciding whether to remove the
space shuttle from the launch pad for repairs.
   While preparing for that crucial July 28 test, engineers will
decide if there is a way to fix the difficult-to-reach leak on the
pad, whether the leak can be isolated from the fuel system or if it
is so insignificant that is does not pose a flight hazard if left
as is.
   ``By draining and purging the line, engineers have stabilized
the leak and feel it is safe to proceed with the flight readiness
firing,'' Chuck Hollinshead, director of public affairs at the
Kennedy Space Center, said Sunday.
   If Discovery has to be rolled back to a hangar, its planned
launch as the first post-Challenger shuttle flight would be delayed
up to two months. The flight readiness firing of the three engines
already has been delayed two days, so even if the shuttle stays on
the pad, there likely will be a delay of at least a few days of the
Sept. 6 launch target date.
   The decision Sunday by shuttle managers came after engineers
traced the source of the gas leak to a fitting on a line leading to
an oxidizer tank that serves a steering engine system.
   The steering engines maneuver the shuttle in orbit and are
separate from the main propulsion engines that are to be test fired.
   The oxidizer tank is deep within an engine compartment and
engineers said the leak probably could not be reached without
removing the 22-foot-high compartment, a very complex operation
never before done on the launch pad.
   By going ahead with the test firing, shuttle managers hope to
minimize lost time if Discovery has to be taken off the pad.
Engineers have completed two weeks of preparation for the test,
operations they would have to repeat if the firing were conducted
after the shuttle was taken back to the hangar and then returned to
the pad.
   The flight readiness firing will check engine modifications made
since the Challenger explosion and provide the launch team with
valuable launch countdown practice.
   Discovery is being prepared for the first shuttle mission since
Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986,
killing its crew of seven.
   The flight originally was scheduled for February but has been
postponed five times because of various technical problems.
   Five veteran shuttle crew members are to ride Discovery on a
four-day mission during which they are to deploy a communications
satellite, conduct experiments and check out more than 200
modifications made since the Challenger accident.

   Four U.S. soldiers were recovering
today from wounds sustained when a carload of men hurled bombs and
fired guns at a group of off-duty American servicemen in a
discotheque parking lot, officials said.
   Authorities had no suspects and were ``intensively
investigating'' the attack early Sunday outside the Confetti disco
in San Pedro Sula, said a police official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Barclay said no group had claimed
responsibility for the attack, which occurred at about 1 a.m. in
Honduras' second-largest city.
   Barclay, in a telephone interview, said the four soldiers
wounded in the attack were hospitalized in satisfactory condition.
Embassy officials refused to identify them until their families
were notified.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said the wounded men ``were out of danger.'' He did not elaborate.
   The soldiers were on leave from Palmerola Air Force Base, 41
miles northeast of the capital of Tegucigalpa, and were in civilian
clothes and carrying no weapons at the time of the attack, Barclay
said.
   ``The American soldiers were on a one-day recreation trip to San
Pedro Sula,'' he said.
   They were leaving the nightspot's parking lot in a civilian
vehicle rented from a Honduran company when the attackers threw
small bombs and opened fire from inside another car in the parking
lot, U.S. officials said.
   The vehicle with the soldiers immediately sped away.
   ``The attackers threw explosive bombs and shot at them with
small-caliber weapons,'' Barclay said.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood said nine
soldiers were attacked as they drove out of the discotheque's
parking lot. She said there were 10 or 12 attackers.
   ``I guess if there's a hero in this, it's the driver,'' Wood
said. ``He took evasive action. He drove away fast. He did things
right.'' The driver's name was not available.
   The Confetti disco is frequented by U.S. military personnel. San
Pedro Sula, is 125 miles north of the capital. The injured were
taken to a hospital in San Pedro Sula and later flown to Palmerola.
   Maj. Wood said about 150 soldiers were on the one-day leave and
that all returned to Palmerola as a precautionary measure.
   The United States has maintained a varying numbers of American
troops in Honduras since the leftist Sandinistas seized power in
neighboring Nicaragua in 1979.
   At least 30 American troops in Honduras have been killed or
wounded in accidents or incidents of violence since the United
States began joint military maneuvers with the Honduran military in
1982.
   Ten soldiers were injured in a helicopter crash during the
deployment of about 1,500 American troops to Honduras in March
following a reported incursion by Nicaraguan troops into Honduras.
   In August 1987, a pipe bomb exploded at a restaurant in
Comayagua, 12 miles north of Palmerola, seriously injuring five
U.S. soldiers and six civilians, including one American.
   The Honduran military said four suspects picked up in connection
with that bombing told them the attack was part of a campaign
directed by a ``foreign leftist organization.''
   A wave of anti-American protests broke out in April following
the deportation to the United States of a reputed international
drug baron.
   Juan Ramon Matta, 43, was taken to the United States to face
drug trafficking charges and questioning for the 1986 slaying in
Mexico of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique
Camarena.
   The Honduran constitution forbids the deportation of Honduran
nationals.
   Demonstrators burned the U.S. Consulate and U.S. Information
Service office in the capital to protest Matta's deportation and
the U.S. military presence in Honduras. The violence prompted the
government to temporarily impose a state of emergency restricting
civil liberties.

   Vietnamese authorities will turn over
to U.S. diplomats Tuesday three U.S. Navy aviators rescued by a
Vietnamese ship after their plane crashed into the South China Sea
last week, the Navy said today.
   Chief Petty Officer James O'Leary said in a telephone interview
from Subic Bay Naval Base that the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok,
Thailand, is to send a plane Tuesday to fetch the three from Tan
Son Nhut airport in Vietnam and fly them to Thai capital.
   A Navy plane was to then fly the three aviators _ Lt. Richard K.
Maurer of Harvey's Lake, Pa; Lt. j.g. Elizabeth A. Steinnecker of
Corpus Christi, Texas; and Petty Officer First Class Michael A.
Neel of Albuquerque, N.M. _ back to Subic, 50 miles northwest of
Manila.
   The three were flying back to Subic from Singapore aboard a
CT-39E twin-engine jet when they crashed in the South China Sea
near the Spratly islands last Tuesday, Navy spokesmen said.
   American and Malaysian aircraft had been conducting an extensive
search for the three when Vietnamese authorities notified the State
Department in Washington on Friday that a Vietnamese vessel had
rescued the three fliers.

<TEXT>
   Cheeseburgers with a side of fries may be on
their way to Warsaw to put American-style fast food on the Polish
menu.
   Two Indianapolis companies, SaniServ and Curtis International,
plan to open Burger Boy restaurants in Warsaw within the year, said
businessman Gabriel E. Aguirre.
   ``There's nothing there to compare with the fast food as you
know it,'' said Aguirre, president of SaniServ, a maker of
food-service equipment. ``There's different types of finger foods,
but nothing in the magnitude of what we have here.''
   Burger Boy's menu will be almost completely American, with
double and single burgers, cheeseburgers, fish sandwiches, french
fries, shakes, soft drinks and dessert turnovers.
   ``There will also be a minimum of one product known very well to
the nationals, like kielbasa,'' Aguirre said Saturday.
   The restaurants will sell food and buy supplies using the local
currency, the zloty, which will make its menu affordable to the
average Pole.
   ``If they charge in local money it will be enormously popular, I
think,'' said David Mason, a Butler University political scientist
who specializes in Poland. But Mason questioned whether the
restaurants could find such items as ground beef in Poland.
   ``For somebody who's not into the system, I don't know how
they'd get meat,'' said Mason, whose most recent visit to Poland
was two years ago. ``The kind of meat they put into hamburgers
would be very hard to find.''
   Aguirre, however, said he already has visited local bakeries and
meat processors and didn't foresee any problems in obtaining
supplies.
   ``About 2{ or 3 years ago, there were a lot of difficulties for
Poles to obtain food,'' he said. ``Things have really changed in
the last two years.''
   As part of economic reforms in Poland, the government has
encouraged western companies to invest there, Mason said.
Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola soft drinks already are made and sold
there, he said.
   ``There are a lot of American-style places run by Poles,'' Mason
said. ``When we were there a couple years ago they were selling
pizza, although it's not pizza as we know it. They also had hot dog
stands, but what they call hot dogs were buns filled with mushrooms
and onions because they didn't have any meat.''
   Aguirre said he hopes to open 25-30 restaurants within the first
two years in Poland. SaniServ will supply equipment and design the
interiors of the restaurants and Curtis International, a trading
company with an office in Poland, will hire local workers and
coordinate operations with suppliers and the government.
   The government, which controls all but the smallest of business
ventures in Poland, will share a percentage of sales, Aguirre said.
The share is less than 10 percent, he said.
   Curtis is a subsidiary of Curtis Publishing Co., owned by
Indianapolis City-County Council President Beurt R. SerVaas.
   SaniServ was part of the operating company for the former Burger
Chef chain. In 1977, Burger Chef was sold to Hardee's Food Systems
Inc., and Aguirre bought SaniServ.
   In April, McDonald's opened its first outlet in a Soviet-bloc
country, in Budapest, Hungary. The burger giant also announced it
would open a string of restaurants in Moscow starting next year.

<TEXT>
   In a long day of raids on drug
traffickers that involved intense gun battles, police said they
killed 16 people and arrested 32 in the city's hillside shantytowns
and outlying slums.
   Sunday's effort, called ``Operation Mosaic'', involved 300
policemen and lasted from long before dawn until late at night,
said police spokesman Geovanni Azevedo.
   Among those killed in gun battles between police and drug
traffickers were Rio's top drug kingpins, known as ``Naldo'' and
``Cassiano'' as well as ``Brasilieirinho'' _ or little Brazilian _
a 12-year-old drug runner, police said. Both Naldo and Cassiano
were under age 25.
   Ten of those arrested were police officers who collaborated with
the drug traffickers, according to TV Globo, the nation's largest
private network.
   Azevedo said at least 12 weapons and unspecified quantities of
cocaine, marijuana and ammunition were seized by police who, armed
with submachine guns and revolvers, burst into homes in search of
drug dealers.
   Many of those killed had fled from a June raid on the drug trade
in Rio's principal hillside slum, ``Rocinha''.
   The news media has recently accused the city's police force of
allowing the drug trade to escalate in Rio.
   Drug lords are often considered ``Robin Hoods'' in the city's
slums because some have helped out poor families, protected the
shantytowns from common criminals and hosted massive parties. About
250,000 people live in the slums.

President Anwar Sadat disarmed their guards and shot their way out
of a maximum-security prison.
   The prisoners, former army officers and members of a Moslem
fundamentalist group known as Jihad, or holy war, fled Sunday after
one knocked out a guard with an iron bar and another a guard while
snatching his rifle, police said.
   The three, armed with the guards' automatic rifles, made their
way through the main prison gate after exchanging fire with other
guards, the officials said. Tora prison lies on the outskirts of
Cairo.
   Officials said the guards were unable to pursue the three before
they disappeared. It was not immediately known whether the escapees
fled into the populated area surrounding the prison or left in a
getaway vehicle.
   Officials would not say whether the escapees received outside
help.
   Interior Minister Zaki Badr announced a state of alert among
police forces, ordered a manhunt for the convicts and offered a
``big'' reward for their capture.
   He also fired the chief of the prison system, Maj. Gen. Salah
Ghaleb, and replaced him with Maj. Gen. Nabil Osman. The
state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram said security measures were taken at
air and sea ports to prevent the fugitives from escaping the
country.
   The three were identified as Mohammed Khames, 40, Esam
el-Kemary, 37, and Ahmed el-Aswani, 31.
   They were convicted of complicity in plotting the assassination
and were among 17 Jihad members sentenced to life imprisonment by
the supreme military court in 1982 for their involvement in the
killing.
   The same court also sentenced five members of the Moslem
fundamentalist group to death on the same charges. The five were
hanged.
   Sunday's escape was believed to be the first by any of the 17
convicted in Sadat's death, all of whom were placed in Tora prison.
   Sadat was assassinated Oct. 6, 1981, during a military parade in
Cairo. Hosni Mubarak succeeded him as president.
   Officials said members of the Jihad group briefly took over part
of the southern city of Assiut two days after Sadat's death in
hopes of a nationwide uprising.
   Officials said at the time that 87 people, including 66
policemen, were killed and 156 were injured during the riots.
   Egypt has maintained emergency laws since the assassination to
combat terrorism.
   The laws ban demonstrations, unauthorized assembly and strikes
and give the government wide powers to conduct searches without
warrants and arrest people regarded as security risks.
   In March, Badr told Parliament that authorities had uncovered
227 cases of ``extremist action'' involving 1,458 defendants in the
past two years.

   A Soviet mathematician whose emigration was
blocked for nine years by officials claiming he was privy to state
secrets arrived in Boston for cancer and heart disease treatments.
   About 30 well-wishers, family members and political figures who
worked for the release of 50-year-old Benjamin Charny greeted him
Saturday at Logan International Airport.
   ``One of the first things I'll do (is) give a hug to all of my
family, especially the little ones,'' said Charny, who is scheduled
for a preliminary hospital examination today.
   Charny flew here with American industrialist Armand Hammer
aboard Hammer's private jet. The 90-year-old chairman of Occidental
Petroleum Co. said he appealed directly to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev on Charny's behalf.
   ``This has been a difficult case. I think it's another example
of the improving relations between our countries,'' said Hammer,
whose ties to the Soviet Union go back to Vladimir Lenin.
   Charny and his wife, Yadviga, 52, a metallurgist, were met by
their daughter, Anna Charny-Blank, who lives in Brookline, and
Charny's younger brother, Leon, a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology doctoral student.
   Also greeting Charny at the airport were Kitty Dukakis, the wife
of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the apparent Democratic presidential
nominee; and U.S. Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry.
   ``I can tell you that I'm infinitely grateful to Mr. Hammer
(who) brought me to you as a magician in a fairytale,'' Charny said.
   In 1986, the New England Medical Center offered Charny free
medical treatment for his various ailments. Leslie Fuhrer, a
spokesman for the hospital, said Charny is scheduled for a
preliminary examination today with a cardiologist.
   Charny, who has undergone surgery for a cancerous tumor on his
back, is suffering from what is believed to be a benign tumor on
his neck that must be removed.
   He has chronic heart disease and recently suffered a heart
attack. Soviet physicians were reluctant to operate on the neck
tumor for fear his heart was too weak.
   As a mathematician, Charny worked from 1966-1971 calculating the
re-entry orbits of Soviet space probes. But in 1977, he lost his
job when he applied for an exit visa.
   During the U.S-Soviet summit in Moscow in May, Charny met with
President Reagan at a gathering of prominent refuseniks at the
American embassy. His release resolves one of the better-known
refusenik cases.

<HEAD>Soviets Say American Defector Was Harassed, FBI Calls Him Spy
Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union says it has granted political
asylum to an American who was ``unfoundedly persecuted'' by U.S.
intelligence agents. The FBI says the defector was the target of an
espionage investigation.
   The government daily Izvestia and the official Tass news agency
reported Sunday that the man sought asylum because he was being
hounded by U.S. agents. But FBI spokesman Thomas Deaken in
Washington, D.C., said Glenn Michael Souther, a U.S. Navy veteran
in his early 30s, was the subject of a ``pending'' espionage case.
   He said Souther disappeared in May 1986 shortly after graduating
as a Russian major from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va.
   Deakin refused to give details of the case involving Souther. He
said he could not say when the case had been opened, but that
``it's been pending since before'' Souther disappeared.
   In today's editions, The Washington Post quoted unidentified
sources as saying FBI and Navy officials were concerned about
Souther's disappearance because he had special security clearances.
   Souther disappeared shortly after being questioned by FBI agents
and is known to have visited his mother in Illinois and used a
one-way ticket to Rome, the home of his former wife and son, the
Post reported.
   One U.S. intelligence expert told the paper that investigators
had been acting ``on more than suspicions, but didn't catch him in
the act'' and thus could not hold Souther at the time he was
questioned.
   Deakin said he had no information on the report.
   Izvestia said Souther's appeal to the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, or the parliament, for refuge in the Soviet Union was
motivated by his wish ``to hide from U.S. secret services which
unfoundedly persecuted him.''
   ``Guided by humane considerations, the presidium of the Supreme
Soviet of the USSR complied with the request,'' it said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert said American diplomats
were not contacted about the incident and were unfamiliar with both
the man and the circumstances surrounding his flight.
   A duty officer at Izvestia said he did not know how to contact
the American and that the editorial offices responsible for the
publication were closed for the weekend.
   Other Americans have defected to the Soviet Union in recent
years. In January, Theodore and Cheryl Branch of Erie, Pa., sought
and were granted asylum while on a tourist trip to the country.
   An American serviceman, Wade Roberts, was granted asylum here in
April 1987 after leaving his post in Giessen, West Germany, and
slipping across the border into East Germany in the trunk of a
rented car. Roberts decided late last year that he was unhappy with
his new life in Soviet Turkmenia and turned himself in to U.S.
authorities to face desertion charges.
   Arnold Lockshin, an American Communist Party activist from
Houston, arrived in Moscow with his family in October 1986 and has
settled in the capital, according to Soviet press reports.
Lockshin, a cancer researcher, claimed he was harassed by the CIA
because of his political views.
   Another American who was granted refuge in the Soviet Union is
Edward Lee Howard, a former CIA agent who defected in August 1986.
Howard disappeared from his Santa Fe, N.M. home in September 1985,
when the FBI was about to arrest him on suspicion of spying.

   On a stage backed by a sparkling American flag,
Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter danced cheek-to-cheek. A quintet of
Hollywood ``brat pack'' actors clustered in the back. And Walter
Cronkite was making the rounds.
   Politicians, journalists and celebrities staged a final fling
Sunday night before the opening of the Democratic National
Convention here tonight.
   Turner Broadcasting Company shut down CNN Center, next door to
the convention arena, to throw a bash. Despite the glittering guest
list, the undisputed star was Michael Dukakis, who will be named
his party's presidential nominee this week.
   Dukakis introduced his wife and children, noting that his son
John ``came to us two weeks ago and with great joy informed us that
we would be grandparents.''
   John's wife Lisa is expecting the candidate's first grandchild
``sometime between the 18th and the 23rd of January,'' Dukakis said.
   As Dukakis spoke, young actors Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Alec
Baldwin and Ally Sheedy watched from the back of the room by a
buffet table filled with roast beef, fruit and fresh vegetables.
   Dukakis and his vice presidential choice, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, were whisked away for a Dukakis family gathering hosted by
his second cousin, Atlanta restaurateur Pano Karatassos.
   Mingling in the crowd were dozens of news stars like Walter
Cronkite and Dan Rather. Many of them rushed to the Turner party
from an extravagant affair hosted by Cox Enterprises Inc., the
parent company for The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution.
   In an air-conditioned tent between the Woodruff Arts Center and
the High Museum of Art, Anne Cox Chambers held court. She is a
former U.S. ambassador to Belgium, chairman of Atlanta Newspapers
Inc., and daughter of the Democratic Party's 1920 nominee, James
Cox.
   Two other top women media executives _ The Washington Post Co.
Chairman Katharine Graham and The Christian Science Monitor Editor
Katherine Fanning _ were among the media elite lingering by mock
newsstand bars.
   Inside was a replica of Cox's 1920 campaign button, a pocketside
Atlanta guide published especially for delegates, a brand new book
of political satire by four Pulitzer Prize-winning Cox cartoonists
and the latest book by The Atlanta Constitution cartoonist Doug
Marlette.
   Party favors at a brunch thrown earlier Sunday by Gannett Co.
Inc. included a personalized, campaign-style button emblazoned with
a picture of the guest standing beside Michael Dukakis on a USA
Today front page.
   A band in boaters played Dixieland music for the guests as they
plowed through a lavish buffet of omelets, oysters, pastries and
waffles.
   Dozens of smaller parties _ including 56 separate events for
individual delegations _ kept most convention-goers busy on Sunday.
   ``The parties are always elaborate,'' Cronkite told a reporter
at the Cox party, ``but I think the hospitality here in Atlanta has
been exceptional. I don't recall conventions where the delegates
were invited to go to many parties in private homes.''
   Republicans Phil and Sue Downer, owners of a brick Victorian
mansion built in 1902 by Coca-Cola Co. magnate Asa Candler Jr.,
offered their home as one of the host sites for a neighborhood
dinner for Democratic eongressmen hosted by Atlanta Rep. John Lewis.
   ``I'm supporting the neighborhood and the city. We think the
world of John Lewis,'' said Downer, a lawyer.
   ``I'm sure the guy who built this house is twirling in his
grave,'' said one guest, Rep. George Crockett of Michigan. ``I know
he never dreamed a black person would be sitting here like this,
and certainly not a black congressman. This is an indication of how
far Atlanta has come.''

<HEAD>Four Children Killed In Fire</HEAD>

   Investigators say faulty electrical wiring
may have sparked a house fire that killed four children and injured
their parents.
   Sixteeen firefighters also were injured battling the blaze
Sunday, most of them by a live electrical wire inside the house,
fire officials said.
   The two-alarm fire spread to an adjacent building but was under
control in about an hour, officials said.
   The parents, Denise Presley, 34, and Michael Faison, 30, escaped
by climbing out a window, officials said. Killed in the fire were
the couple's 1-year-old son, Christian; Faison's daughter, Quadria,
8; his son, Eric, 9; and Ms. Presley's 11-year-old son, Curtis.
   Fire officials said the children were watching television in a
back bedroom when the fire started. Firefighters attempted to
rescue the children, and several injured themselves in the process,
officials said.
   ``We were told there were children trapped,'' said firefighter
Carlo Allodoli. ``We made an attack from the front to the second
floor, when one of our guys was hit by an electrical wire. The
electrical wire wrapped around his body, and whoever touched him
was receiving an electrical shock also.''
   Faison was reported in critical condition at the burn center at
Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland. Ms. Presley was treated at
St. Agnes Medical Center for second-degree burns and released, said
nursing supervisor Tina Trants.
   Two firefighters who received shocks were in guarded condition
at Misericordia Hospital, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Secor.
   She said seven other firefighters were treated at
Misericoridia's Fitzgerald Mercy center for smoke inhalation and
were under observation.
   One firefighter was treated at St. Agnes for electrocution burns
and released, said Ms. Trants, as were two other firefighters
treated for smoke inhalation.
   Fire officials said four firefighters were treated for smoke
inhalation at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center and
released.

   Nicaraguan rebel
leaders headed into a crucial meeting today splintered by
disagreements over who should lead the anti-Sandinista movement.
   The 54-member Nicaraguan Resistance Assembly, comprising
representatives of exiled political parties and business and labor
groups, began three days of talks Sunday in Santo Domingo.
   Sunday's closed-door session dealt mainly with financial and
administration matters, said assembly spokesman Frank Arana. Today,
the Contras were expected to vote on a new seven-member directorate.
   The five current assembly directors _ Adolfo Calero, Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, Alfredo Cesar, Aristides Sanchez and Azucena
Ferrey _ are seeking another one-year term. The two other seats
have been vacant.
   Col. Enrique Bermudez, the Contras' controversial military
commander, announced Sunday he was seeking election as an
independent to one of the vacant seats in the directorate.
   He said his candidacy represented an attempt to reorganize the
organization and give the military arm of the Contra movement a
formal say in political decisions.
   ``The purpose would be to project the image of unity,
integration and participation'' of all factions involved in the
seven-year war to overthrow Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government, Bermudez said.
   Bermudez, 56, one of the founders of the resistance movement,
faces opposition from other Nicaraguan exiles, who accuse him of
maintaining close ties with supporters of the deposed Nicaraguan
dictator Anastasio Somoza and of trying to take over the movement.
   Critics say his elevation to the directorate would place too
much political power in the hands of the military.
   Bermudez' candidacy casts doubt on the future of assembly
director Calero, currently considered the political head of the
movement.
   Chamorro and Calero tried unsuccessfully to remove Bermudez as
military chief in April after he fired six regional Contra
commanders in Nicaragua for lack of discipline.
   Calero declined comment on Bermudez' candidacy, saying only that
he would work with whoever is elected to the directorate.
   Chamorro said if the colonel wants to sit on the directorate, he
should renounce his position as commander-in-chief of the Contra
forces.
   ``When there are seven people, and only one of them has a gun,
then the one who gets his way is the one with the gun,'' Chamorro
said.
   Another assembly director, Cesar, welcomed Bermudez' candidacy,
saying he could assume the role of ``a sort of defense minister''
for the group, representing the interests of the rebel forces.
   ``My personal opinion is that it will strengthen the
directorate,'' he said. ``To me, it's not only a sign of unity but
it's also a sign that the military commanders are a lot more
interested now in political matters.''
   He argued that if Bermudez wins it will strengthen the
likelihood of a political settlement of the Nicaraguan conflict.
   Bermudez denied that he had any interest in consolidating
personal power and said he thought he could heal divisions within
the movement.
   ``We are trying to regroup and reorganize the exiles ... to
complement the efforts of the political parties in Nicaragua,'' he
said.
   Asked whether he was seeking a greater voice for the military
within the resistance movement, Bermudez said: ``Not a greater
voice _ participation.''
   The Contras took up arms against the government in 1981. Many of
them had once supported the rightist, pro-American dictator Somoza,
who was swept from power and replaced by the leftist Sandinistas in
1979.
   The United States cut off military aid to the rebels in February
and reductions in non-military aid led to lay-offs of 130 Contra
staffers and the closing of political offices worldwide.
   On March 23, the Contras and Sandinistas signed a cease-fire
accord and began a series of talks that have so far failed to
achieve their desired goal _ a lasting peace.

   Hundreds of people jeered and taunted
the younger brother of former President Chun Doo-hwan today as he
went on trial on charges of embezzling millions of dollars.
   Prosecutors questioned Chun Kyung-hwan, 46, about allegations he
had amassed a fortune by using government and family connections as
head of the semi-official Saemaul Undong development group during
his brother's administration.
   The opening session was marked by boos and taunts as Chun
consistently denied prosecution charges. Abut 400 people inside the
crowded courtroom shouted ``Punish Chun'' as hundreds of police
stood guard outside.
   The younger Chun was arrested March 31 and accused of peddling
influence and embezzling about $10 million in Saemaul funds,
investing them in real estate and private business.
   Also on trial were 12 other people, including Saemaul officials
and the younger Chun's two brothers-in-law. They have been indicted
on embezzlement, bribery and other charges.
   Chun and most other defendants denied charges of diverting
millions of dollars to invest in real estate, contending the money
was spent only for Saemaul development projects.
   But some of Chun's aides acknowledged government charges and
said Chun sanctioned embezzlement and tax evasion. If convicted, he
could face a prison sentence or the death penalty in the most
extreme case.
   The opposition has demanded parliamentary questioning about
wrongoings under the former president, who left office in February
at the end of a seven-year term.
   Today, three opposition party leaders, including Kim Dae-jung,
issued a joint statement that accused President Roh Tae-woo with
trying to protect his predecessor.
   ``We demand pesident Roh take a clear attitude as liquidator of
wrongdoings under the former administration,'' the statement said.
   President Roh accepted a cabinet decision July 14 to veto two
opposition-sponsored bills aimed at forcing the former president to
testify in the National Assembly on corruption charges.
   The bills, which have been returned to the legislature, would
likely be killed as the opposition lacks a two-thirds majority
required to override a presidential veto. The opposition controls a
combined 166 seats in the 299-member assembly.

   Sheep wandering into the wrong pasture
touched off a two-day sectarian battle in northern Lebanon that
left six people dead and 31 wounded, police said today.
   Police also said a booby-trapped car exploded today near the
main entrance to Hotel-Dieu Hospital in Christian east Beirut's
residential district of Ashrafiyeh when its owner turned on the
ignition.
   The blast also wounded a passerby, set three other cars ablaze
and shattered glass in nearby buildings.
   Police said they had no information about the motive for the
bombing. They said the victim's license, found in the car's
wreckage, identified him as Youssef Camille Fares.
   In northern Lebanon over the weekend, the Maronite Catholic
population of the Qoubaiyat township fought the Shiite Moslem
Jaafar clan in the neighboring village of Shanbook with machine
guns and rocket-propelled grenades, police said.
   Interior Minister Abdulla Rassi said about 80 Syrian troops
intervened at his request to quell the clashes in the area, 70
miles northeast of Beirut.
   Rassi said in a statement published by the Beirut newspaper
Al-Anwar that the flare-up was not politically motivated. He did
not elaborate.
   But a police spokesman said a ``flock of sheep from Qoubaiyat
strayed into pastures claimed by the Jaafars on Saturday, prompting
Shiite tribesmen to take up arms to drive off the intruding sheep
and shepherds.''
   The fighting raged through Sunday until Syrian troops set up
buffer zones between the two sides at dawn today, said the
spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   Two regular Lebanese army soldiers from Qoubaiyat were among the
six killed and three others among the 20 wounded, police said.
   Qoubaiyat has a population of 20,000 and Shanbook has an
estimated 5,000 inhabitants.
   Lebanon has been torn by civil strife for nearly 13 years that
most often pits Christian against Moslem milities.

   The devastation from tornadoes that
turned parts of Iowa into a disaster area, damaging 10,000 homes
and injuring 94 people, is drawing federal officials here today to
assess the situation.
   For the third night in a row, the Iowa National Guard remained
on duty early today to enforce a curfew intended to prevent
looting. Thousands of residents remained without power.
   Gov. Terry Branstad declared Pottawattamie County, which
includes Council Bluffs, a disaster area on Sunday.
   ``To see that kind of devastation and not have more personal
injuries or more serious injuries, I think we can just count our
blessings,'' Branstad said Sunday after touring the area.
   Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
regional office in Kansas City planned to tour Council Bluffs today
to assess the destruction.
   Council Bluffs Mayor Tom Hanafan said Sunday that losses to
residences and commercial buildings totaled $16.5 million.
Insurance adjusters projected the overall damage figure would reach
$20 million to $25 million.
   A thunderstorm packing 92 mph winds and up to four funnel clouds
skipped over downtown Omaha on Friday afternoon before one funnel
touched down briefly on the Interstate 480 bridge that spans the
Missouri River, connecting Omaha and Council Bluffs.
   Within minutes a tornado slammed into a 700-square-block area of
western Council Bluffs, severely damaging at least 160 homes,
uprooting 100-foot trees, downing power lines and upending scores
of railroad cars. Officials estimated the city lost 30 percent of
its trees.
   Larry Allen, chairman of the Pottawattamie County Board of
Supervisors, estimated 10,000 homeowners will file insurance claims
for damage caused by the tornadoes.
   ``I think we were a whisper away from a major catastrophe,''
Omaha Mayor Walt Calinger said.
   The governor said the disaster declaration will make the county
eligible for state and federal relief funds. He said damage
estimates would be presented today to FEMA in an attempt to speed
relief to victims.
   Hanafan said round-the-clock work likely would continue through
Wednesday to clear trees and return traffic lights to working order.
   The mayor said some minor looting was reported, but he
downplayed the incidents and said no arrests were made.
   The area of the curfew, which was in effect since Friday, was
reduced to a section of about 100 square blocks Sunday. Earlier it
covered most of the northern half of the city.
   ``The real work starts when we get into the case work. This is
really only the tip of the iceberg,'' said Jack Kellog, a volunteer
for the Pottawattamie County chapter of the Red Cross.
   ``For one day, they can eat canned beans. After that, they need
some nutrition,'' he said.
   Hanafan said the $16.5 million loss figure is what city
officials plan to file with the FEMA. It includes only residences
and commercial buildings. It does not include some categories of
damage that insurance adjusters used to come up with the $20
million to $25 million estimates, such as damage to public
facilities and business costs.

   The government-besieged Teamsters union is
celebrating an end to its 32-year marriage of convenience with
Republican presidential candidates, and has chosen to dance with a
new partner at the Democratic National Convention.
   Even though the union's new president is an Irish Catholic
Bostonian who supported Michael Dukakis' opponents in previous
elections, the Teamsters hosted a party here Sunday night
symbolizing a return to the labor movement's half-century courtship
with Democrats.
   William J. McCarthy's upset election last week to succeed the
late Jackie Presser as the Teamsters' president had cast doubts
among some union leaders that organized labor could unite behind
the Democratic presidential nominee for the first time since 1956.
   McCarthy, 69, had supported Edward King in both his 1978 upset
of the incumbent Dukakis for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination in Massachusetts and had opposed Dukakis' successful
challenge of King four years later.
   ``That sort of personalizes it,'' one official of another union
commented.
   McCarthy is known among other labor leaders to have opposed the
Teamsters' reaffiliation with the AFL-CIO last October. Implicit in
the reunion was an understanding that the Teamsters would go along
with the labor federation's Democratic presidential endorsement.
   Commanding a fourth of the delegates at this week's convention,
labor leaders have openly wondered whether the new Teamsters chief
would abide by Presser's promise to work with the rest of labor
``to create the biggest political giant this country has ever
seen.''
   With the largest political campaign chest of any group in the
country, the question is not academic.
   At the end of March, the Teamsters' DRIVE (Democratic,
Republican, Independent Voter Education) political action committee
had $5.5 million _ $1.5 million more than the American Medical
Association and $1.8 million more than the National Association of
Realtors.
   Teamster political operatives sought to assure more than a dozen
presidents of other unions here Sunday that McCarthy's upset
election last Friday over Dukakis supporter Weldon Mathis,
Presser's designated heir, will not return the union to the GOP
camp.
   ``There's about as much chance of us endorsing George Bush as
there is it snowing in Atlanta tomorrow,'' said one senior Teamster
official.
   The Teamsters generally had courted Republican presidential
candidates ever since Dwight Eisenhower's bid for re-election in
1956.
   Presser had been the only major labor leader in the country to
support Ronald Reagan in the 1980 and 1984 elections, saying then
the AFL-CIO was out of touch with workers in its endorsements of
Democrats Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale.
   But Presser, who died July 9, began grumbling about the Reagan
administration more the four years ago, first over its appointees
to the National Labor Relations Board and then over his indictment
in 1986 on labor racketeering and embezzlement charges.
   The final straw, according to Teamster officials, was the
government's suit to wrest control of the union from its leaders on
a claim they are puppets of organized crime.
   McCarthy was notably absent from Sunday's reception. Teamsters
and other labor leaders said that is characteristic of the low
priority he places on national presidential politics.
   Upon taking over the union's reins last Friday, McCarthy said he
would have no comment on a Teamsters presidential endorsement
``until after both conventions, Democratic and Republican'' _ the
same position taken officially by the AFL-CIO.
   But a Teamster official noted that, despite his endorsement of
Dukakis' opponent in Massachusetts gubernatorial races, McCarthy
had served on the governor's labor-management council.
   And a senior AFL-CIO official acknowledged that the Teamsters
were not alone in abandoning Dukakis at the end of his first time
as Massachusetts' governor.
   ``About half the labor movement was against him then,'' the
official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``He messed
up his first term.''
   Another Teamster official also noted that Dukakis _ although he
was the last of the Democratic presidential candidates to do so _
had spoken against a Justice Department suit to take over the
1.6-million-member union on a claim its leaders are puppets of
organized crime.
   ``George Bush is the only candidate out there now who has not
spoken against the suit,'' said Tim O'Neill, a spokesman for the
union.
   Asked if the Teamsters planned a similar reception at the GOP
convention next month in New Orleans, another official commented
coldly: ``We see no reason to be there.''

   In a weedy field amid abandoned railroad
tracks and stacks of 55-gallon drums stands an old brick firehouse
called ``Butch's Hauling.''
   A tanker truck is parked next to a sewer drain, setting the
stage for ``midnight dumpers'' to dispose of hazardous wastes
illegally and unsafely _ and for investigators to practice catching
them.
   Hundreds of law enforcement agents and evironmental officers
gather at Butch's Hauling each year to practice ways of
investigating reports of illegal waste dumping.
   They are the forces battling a national problem that is
particularly acute in the densely packed Northeast, with its heavy
industrialization, high costs for proper dumping and lack of places
to do it.
   The training center is run by the Northeast Hazardous Waste
Project, formed in 1980 to fight illegal chemical dumpers and
serving as the model for similar projects elsewhere. Fourteen
states are part of the project.
   ``Prior to 1980, there was not really any formalized institution
to go after the criminal dumpers legally,'' said Jeanne E. Rush,
director of the Northeast Project. ``I don't think there was an
awareness of how critical the problem was. After that, everything
started being of concern to the states.''
   The Northeast Project has organized 25 training programs, most
lasting three days, for 1,500 participants from local, state and
federal agencies, including the FBI and the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   ``A lot of criminal prosecutors don't have the background in
environmental prosecutions,'' said Ms. Rush. ``There are a lot of
aspects of an environmental criminal trial that are different than
a regular homicide trial.''
   Participants are taught techniques for raiding illegal dump
sites, collecting evidence and preparing search warrants.
   There is an ``awareness'' course that helps members of various
agencies put aside their sometimes-competing interests and work
together.
   ``With this training, we now have a lot more respect and
tolerance for what the other group is doing,'' said Linda Range of
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
   Another course is designed for agents who inspect approved
hazardous waste facilities.
   An advanced course provides a mock waste case to investigate.
   First the trainers set up the scene, dumping drums labeled as if
they carried toxic material, emptying tainted water into sewers and
arranging for a telephone tip to the class.
   The trainees put on their protective suits and masks and go to
work, investigating the tip as they would a real case of illegal
dumping.
   They use files created for the project to investigate the
company involved, take samples of the waste and seek clues from the
drum labels.
   ``It helps to understand the complexities or crack decisions you
have to make,'' project training chairman Jay Strauch said of the
instruction he received in 1983.
   ``The thing that it taught me the most was cooperation with
regulatory people. You have to have somebody tell you what you're
dealing with,'' said Strauch, a criminal investigator in Ohio.
   The project also provides top-level state officials with a way
of exchanging information, coordinating enforcement programs and
passing similar laws in their respective states.
   ``The association has been extremely beneficial in promoting the
federal-state partnership in environmental enforcement,'' said
Carroll G. Wills, an environmental specialist with the EPA's
National Enforcement Investigations Center in Denver.
   The states making up the Northeast Project are Connecticut,
Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont,
Virginia and West Virginia.

   Madonna, the star of ``Who's That Girl?,''
may be wondering ``Where's my dress?''
   A hand-sewn dress of powder blue chiffon worn by the pop singer
in the video ``True Blue'' was stolen Friday from a mall featuring
a rock memorabilia exhibit sponsored by MTV, the cable TV music
channel.
   ``It was a mean thing to do,'' said Chuck Lutz, manager of MTV's
Museum of Unnatural History tour.
   Phil Morosco, general manager of the mall, said security guards
were patrolling the mall when the theft occurred around closing
time Friday night.
   The thief apparently broke into a plexiglass display case,
popped open a frame holding the dress and stole it, leaving behind
a napkin signed by Elvis Presley and letter written by Paul
McCartney when he was a member of the Beatles, officials said.

<BYLINE>Thunderstorms Linger Over Much Of The Nation</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms lost much of their punch as they swirled over the
nation today after a stormy rampage that included a tornado,
destructive high winds, large hail and lightning that killed two
men.
   In New Jersey and New Hampshire, two men died Sunday afternoon
after they were struck by lightning, officials said.
   In southeastern Pennsylvania, houses were damaged and the roof
of an apartment building was partially ripped off Sunday by a
tornado in Pottstown.
   Thunderstorms developing along a stationary front curving
through the central High Plains produced severe weather in western
South Dakota. One thunderstorm produced golf-ball-sized hail at
Pine Ridge and another created dime-sized hail and wind gusts to 75
mph near Hot Springs.
   Thunderstorm winds uprooted trees, damaged a roof and blew over
a concert stage Sunday afternoon at Oswego, N.Y. In New Jersey,
harsh winds ripped down power lines in Union and Hudson counties
and downed trees at Middletown.
   Newark, N.J., set a record-high temperature for the date of 100
degrees, breaking the old high of 99 set in 1977. It was the fifth
time Newark topped 100 degrees this year.
   San Francisco marked the hottest day on record Sunday and
residents stripped down, oiled up and took to the beach in droves
to glory in the unprecedented 103-degree weather.
   While there were numerous reports of severe weather in southern
New England and along the middle Atlantic coast Sunday afternoon,
by early today widely scattered showers and thundershowers were all
that remained ahead of the cold front.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms also were reported
over North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.
   Lingering showers and thunderstorms prevailed in southern
Florida and the central Gulf Coast.
   Dense fog blanketed parts of the Champlain Valley of Vermont
early today while clear skies prevailed west of the Rockies.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the central High Plains through the middle Mississippi
valleys, the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the southern
Appalachians, into the central and eastern Gulf Coast and Florida,
and from New Jersey to Massachusetts; numerous thunderstorms in the
lower Mississippi Valley and from southwestern Iowa to western
lower Michigan; and sunny skies over the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast for the 80s or 90s across much
of the nation; in the upper 70s across northern Montana, the
northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley; near 100 from the Rio
Grande Valley into north-central Texas; between 100 and 110 over
the desert Southwest and the California valleys; and 110 to 115
over southwestern Nevada and the southern and northern valleys of
California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at Havre, Mont., to 96 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises In Active Trading, Gold Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in active trading in Europe today,
still buoyed by last week's U.S. trade report.
   Gold prices fell.
   Traders continued to react positively to Friday's U.S. trade
report, which showed a merchandise trade deficit of $10.9 billion
in May, slightly wider than a revised $10.3 billion in April.
   A trader in Rome trader said that in the absence of an increase
in interest rates by the West German central bank, he expects the
dollar to rise further.
   But a trader in Milan was more cautious on the dollar's trend,
arguing that its upward surge inspired by the trade figures would
fizzle out shortly.
   He also said it was doubtful that the Federal Reserve would be
in any hurry to increase interest rates in the countdown to the
U.S. presidential election.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. The pound
was quoted at $1.6613, compared with $1.6635 Friday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8904 West German marks, up from 1.8780
   _1.5675 Swiss francs, up from 1.5555
   _6.3715 French francs, up from 6.3285
   _2.1246 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1150
   _1,399.35 Italian lire, up from 1,387.25
   _1.2092 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2117
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 1.75 yen to a closing 135.15 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted higher at 135.35 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $437.60 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $438.40. At mid-morning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$437.65.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $437.80, down from $439 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.86 to close at a bid $440.00.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $7.29 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $7.30.

   The last-second basketball victory over
neighboring Big Ten rival Wisconsin in 1986 was a proud moment for
the University of Minnesota to savor. As it turned out, it was the
last proud moment for quite a while.
   On the morning after the 67-65 victory of Jan. 23, 1986, three
members of the Golden Gophers basketball team were accused of rape
in an incident in a Madison, Wis., hotel room.
   The three later were acquitted in a trial filled with sordid
testimony. But the notoriety was only beginning for Minnesota,
which is among the nation's largest universities.
   With 44,293 undergraduate and graduate students and 18,000
extension students, the Minnesota campus sprawls over both banks of
the Mississippi River near downtown Minneapolis.
   The misdeeds, improprieties and embarrassments over the next 31
months were dizzying:
   _The men's basketball team was placed on probation by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association for numerous infractions,
mostly over its recruiting of student athletes.
   _University President Ken Keller resigned in a scandal over
hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on his official residence.
   _Keller's interim replacement, Richard Sauer, admitted
plagiarizing part of a magazine article while applying for a job
elsewhere.
   _A former university official was indicted on charges of
swindling money and giving it to athletes; the school's popular
athletic director, Paul Giel, was fired.
   The troubles may be unprecedented among major universities.
   Robert L. Gale, president of the Association of Governing Boards
of Universities and Colleges, recalls discussing Minnesota's skid
with colleagues. ``They would say, `Those poor devils. Everything
has happened to them at once.'''
   The long-term effect isn't clear.
   ``It is going to be more difficult for the university to
function in an autonomous fashion because the Legislature is going
to be looking over their shoulder a lot more than it has in the
past,'' said Gale.
   After the 1986 rape charges, many people began looking over the
university's shoulder.
   A Big Ten report later that year said the men's athletic
department had the conference's lowest rate of graduation from 1978
through 1983.
   While the school was still reeling from that report, NCAA
investigators arrived to investigate recruiting.
   In March, the NCAA announced 40 rules violations, most of them
in the basketball program under Coach Jim Dutcher, who resigned
after the rape trial.
   In the same month, Keller resigned after a six-week controversy
over university financial management. It was sparked by his $1.5
million renovation of the official residence at more than twice the
budgeted amount.
   Keller also approved a $200,000 remodeling of his offices,
including a $15,822 mahogany desk and credenza.
   Students picketed the mansion, and a local radio station's ditty
referred to Keller as the ``Renovation Man.'' His ``Commitment to
Focus'' plan to upgrade some programs, cut others and reduce
enrollment by 8,000, was mockingly referred to as ``Commitment to
Furniture.''
   A widening probe turned up a $221 million reserve fund. Critics
called it a slush fund, and it rankled professors whose programs
had been targeted for elimination and angered some contributors and
alumni, who quit giving.
   When Sauer took over the president's duties, he remained in his
own home, accepted a used desk and set out to mend fences.
   Then the plagiarism scandal hit him while he was applying for
the presidency of North Dakota State University.
   After he apologized to the University of Minnesota regents, they
gave him a unmanimous vote of confidence. North Dakota State since
has asked him to renew his application for the presidency.
   Sauer's troubles were followed by the athletic department coming
under further investigation. Luther Darville, former acting
director of the school's Office of Minority and Special Student
Affairs, was indicted in May on three counts of felony theft by
swindle.
   Darville has fled to his native Bahamas and authorities have
started extradition proceedings.
   University officials acknowledge that the turnover among top
personnel has caused problems, but they say the school is running
more smoothly than might be expected.
   ``I think the fact is that the university is being well-governed
by the interim people,'' said David Lebedoff, chairman of the
University of Minnesota Board of Regents.
   George Robb, the university's associate vice president for
external relations, said the school's reputation among the public
is less important than its image among potential students and
faculty.
   ``The graduate student or faculty member who might be thinking
about coming here in physics is much more concerned about the
physics department than the athletic department,'' he said. ``We've
got more than 100 new endowed chairs that have resulted from the
fund-raising campaign that just finished. That's almost an
unheard-of number of endowed chairs.''
   David Merkowitz, spokesman for the American Council on
Education, said he couldn't recall any other university having so
many problems recently.
   Still, Merkowitz said, ``I am absolutely sure a university like
Minnesota with 45,000 students is going to survive these things.''

   More than 20 years ago, Jewish satirist Yuli
Daniel was thrown in prison and the verse that helped put him there
banned from official publication. Now, a leading literary magazine
has ended the silence.
   Five poems were published in the magazine Ogonyok Sunday by the
writer who friends say has been in a coma for a month after a
series of heart attacks.
   The weekly published Daniel's work on page 30, along with a
small photo of the poet taken at least 20 years ago.
   ``Yuli Daniel _ prose writer and poet. Yuli Daniel _ war veteran
and a man of difficult fate,'' the magazine said. ``Before you are
his first publications after a break of more than 20 years.''
   The verse published by Ogonyok was markedly less political than
the satires that led to Daniel's arrest and conviction in 1966, but
prominent dissident Sergei Kovalev termed the publication an
important step in the ``interesting and complicated processes we
are going through now.''
   Kovalev said he recognized the poems as among those Daniel wrote
in prison.
   The trial of Daniel, now 63 and ailing, and fellow writer Andrei
Sinyavsky marked the start of a harsh crackdown on dissident
political views and writings.
   Daniel spent five years in prison and labor camp following his
conviction for unauthorized publication of his works abroad. He
worked in Kaluga and Moscow after his release from exile but
refrained from dissident activities.
   The satires that drew official ire in the mid-1960s were
published abroad under the pseudonym Nikolai Arzhak.
   Over the past two years, a handful of Soviet publications
including Ogonyok have taken up Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's call for ``glasnost,'' or more openness, and released
long-banned writings by some of the best-known Soviet intellectuals.
   Ogonyok, despite criticism from officials as high as the ruling
Communist Party Politburo, has continued to release controversial
works by writers disgraced under previous leaderships. It has
carried the most critical analyses to date of repressions meted out
by dictator Josef Stalin.
   Kovalev, who spent 10 years in prison and exile for dissident
political activity during the era of President Leonid I. Brezhnev,
said the publication of Daniel's poems may signal a broader review
of the injustices suffered by artists and activists during
Brezhnev's 18-year leadership.
   ``We hope there will soon be rehabilitation of not only Stalin's
victims, but those of the 1960s as well,'' Kovalev said.
   The poems published Sunday include ``The Ring,'' in which the
author recounts his trial as if it were a boxing match.
   Daniel's biting satire of the Soviet system drew the ire of
Brezhnev's functionaries who instituted a cultural crackdown after
the ouster of Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in October 1964.
   His most famous work, ``This is Moscow Calling,'' mocked what he
saw as insensitivity and detachment in the Kremlin hierarchy. It
included a satirical proposal for a ``Public Murder Day,'' in which
all Soviet citizens over the age of 16 would be allowed to kill
someone, provided it was not a policeman or transport worker.
   Soviet poet Andrei Voznesensky said he had not had a chance to
read Ogonyok but was pleased by the publication of Daniel's poems
after so many years.
   Voznesensky and poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko have emerged as the
most vocal supporters of Gorbachev's policy of giving artists and
intellectuals more freedom of expression.
   Daniel's wife, Irina Uvarova, was at the hospital with her
husband Sunday and could not be reached for comment.
   Sinyavsky, who was tried and convicted with Daniel, emigrated to
Paris after his release from a seven-year term.
   The convictions served to unify many political and cultural
activists who were dismayed by the turnaround they witnessed under
Brezhnev after a period of relative literary freedom under
Khrushchev.

   Rioters pelted police with stones
and set fire to barricades, fences and piles of rubble today before
being driven out of Amsterdam's last great squatter stronghold.
   The abandoned, four-building waterfront warehouse known as
Conradstraadt had been home to scores of squatters for more than a
decade. Today's eviction apparently brings the squatter movement to
a close.
   Police said at least five Conradstraat rioters were arrested for
disorderly conduct and two policemen were injured as baton-wielding
officers tried to clear the perimeter around the squatter community.
   Police initially were forced to pull back from the Conradstraat
after being met by a barrage of paving stones thrown by
demonstrators who had gathered in a vacant lot next to the
warehouse complex Sunday night.
   The Conradstraat complex caught fire during the eviction action,
and police were hampered by billowing black smoke that could be
seen across the city.
   Rioters set fire to fences, piles of rubble and barricades but
it was not determined how the warehouse complex caught fire.
Firefighters and fireboats were called in to battle blazes in the
brick complex.
   Most of the approximately 140 persons who lived or had workshops
in the complex had left by the time the rioting broke out.
   One who stayed throughout the eviction action was a 27-year-old
sculptor, who identified himself only by his first name, Alex.
   ``I've been here two years,'' he told The Associated Press,
``and it was really a good place to be an artist.
   ``We weren't a group, but we were helping each other,'' he said
as he stood in a trash-strewn ground-floor room of the complex.
   As part of an agreement with the city, the squatters had
received utilities service, for which they shared the cost.
   A 42-year-old woman who identified herself as Annettte had lived
in the complex for two years with her seven-year-old twin daughters.
   ``I'm not really glad to leave,'' she said, as she clutched a
few belongings and pondered whether to return to her burning
building to fetch more. The woman, who lived on welfare, said she
would seek lodgings in one of the few remaining squatter dwellings
left in Amsterdam.
   Led by a payloader, riot police converged on the Conradstraat
area shortly after dawn, but their repeated baton charges were
repulsed by demonstrators.
   After about an hour, police gained the upper hand and pushed the
rock-throwing demonstrators out of the rubble-strewn vacant lot.
   The Conradstraat colony has gained fame in Amsterdam because of
the artists' workshops and other impromptu enterprises begun there
by its occupants.

<TEXT>
   The following are excerpts of Security Council
Resolution 598 of July 20, 1987 that was reportedly accepted Monday
by Iran:
   The Security Council...
   1. Demands that, as a first step toward a negotiated settlement,
the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq observe an immediate
cease-fire, discontinue all military actions on land, at sea, and
in the air, and withdraw all forces to the internationally
recognized boundaries without delay.
   2. Requests the Secretary General to dispatch a team of United
Nations observers to verify, confirm, and supervise the cease-fire
and withdrawal and further requests the Secretary General to make
the necessary arrangements in consultation with the parties and to
submit a report thereon to the Security Council.
   3. Urges that prisoners of war be released and repatriated
without delay after the cessation of active hostilities in
accordance with the Third Geneva Convention of Aug. 12, 1949.
   4. Calls upon Iran and Iraq to cooperate with the Secretary
General in implementing this resolution and in mediation efforts to
achieve a comprehensive, just and honorable settlement, acceptable
to both sides, of all outstanding issues, in accordance with the
principles contained in the charter of the United Nations.
   5. Calls upon all other states to exercise the utmost restraint
and to refrain from any act which may lead to further escalation
and widening of the conflict and thus to facilitate the
implementation of the present resolution.
   6. Requests the Secretary General to explore, in consultation
with Iran and Iraq, the question of entrusting an impartial body
with inquiring into responsibility for the conflict and to report
to the Council as soon as possible.
   7. Recognizes the magnitude of the damage inflicted during the
conflict and the need for reconstruction efforts, with appropriate
international assistance, once the conflict is ended and, in this
regard, requests the Secretary General to assign a team of experts
to study the question of reconstruction and to report to the
Council.
   8. Further requests the Secretary General to examine, in
consultation with Iran and Iraq and with other states of the
region, measures to enhance the security and stability of the
region.
   9. Requests the Secretary General to keep the Council informed
on the implementation of this resolution.
   10. Decides to meet again as necessary to consider further steps
to ensure compliance with this resolution.''

   Mike O'Brien always believed a good miniature
golf course was one of the best expressions of American folk art,
so he couldn't help but wonder what a course designed by trained
artists would be like.
   Now he's got his answer, in the form of ``Par Excellence!'' _ an
indoor 18-hole miniature golf course that opened Saturday at a
gallery owned by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. It was
designed by O'Brien and 21 other Chicago artists.
   Gone are the Dutch Windmills and Chinese pagodas. In their place
are wrecked cars, earthquake debris, cemeteries and nuclear weapons.
   Players can putt over the bottle-cap strewn floor of a tavern,
into a corporate boardroom and through an archway dedicated to
``tasteless home improvement materials.''
   At the 18th hole, the Grim Reaper gets the ball _ and keeps it.
   O'Brien did the 13th hole himself.
   ``It's called `In Search of Par Excellence,' after a popular
business book,'' said O'Brien as he put the finishing touches
Saturday on his hardwood trimmed miniature executive suite.
   ``You shoot through the sales bar graph, and if you hit top
sales, your ball goes into the corner office _ the one with the
picture windows and the hole,'' he said. ``If your sales are lower,
you wind up in a less desirable office and have to take more
shots.''
   The course, playable at $2 a round, will be in place through
August 20.

   Giving away lemonade is cheaper than
giving away hotel rooms when it's hot. If you have to give away
something, that is.
   The Chamber of Commerce here feels the obligation whenever the
temperature tops 90 degrees, which is not supposed to happen often
in ``Nature's Air-Conditioned City.''
   ``Lemonade Lassies'' in shorts were set for another giveaway
today after a weekend on which the town sweltered through its
hottest day ever _ 96 degrees _ on Saturday.
   Even at $100 a day during this record-setting heat wave, the
giveaway is proving much cheaper than the first ``stunt'' the
chamber tried.
   ``When we first started, we went to the hotel and they
reluctantly agreed not to charge for rooms whenever the temperature
went above 90 degrees,'' said chamber member Eddie Steele.
   ``By golly, it was within two weeks that the hotel was jammed to
the rafters with a convention of Moose'' when the next heat wave
hit. The angry hotel paid off, but ``we only gave away the hotel
rooms once,'' Steele said.
   That was 50 years ago, and the switch to lemonade was on.
   In the past, whole summers have passed without Bluefield giving
away one drop, partly because the temperature of record is at the
airport, which generally has lower readings than downtown.
   When the mark reaches 90, a lemonade giveaway is set for the
next day, except when it reaches 90 on a weekend, when the giveaway
is set for the next workday. After Saturday's 96, the high was
``only'' 89 on Sunday.
   ``We've had to do it about five or six times, which is the most
we've had in 10 or 15 years,'' Steele said.
   Between 300 and 400 people a day have shown up at the chamber's
lemonade stands downtown. Steele is certain townfolk take advantage.
   ``They go out of their way to get it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The city cut water service to an
elderly couple who refused to sign up for mandatory garbage
collection, forcing them to rely on the good will _ and garden
hoses _ of their neighbors.
   Clarence James, 84, and his wife Dorothy, 82, are devoted
recyclers who say they don't need the monthly garbage collection,
which costs a mimimum $2.57.
   ``We don't generate much garbage. We recycle practically
everything, and what little garbage we have goes down the
disposal,'' James said. ``When I get enough cans to be picked up _
about three times a year _ I wait for the garbage man, pay him, and
he takes the bags away.''
   Officials in this coastal community 75 miles southwest of
Portland ordered water service to the couple shut off on Wednesday.
They are among 10 customers who had service cut off for failing to
sign up for garbage pickup.
   City Council adopted the mandatory garbage collection law last
fall because the community has been plagued by illegal dumping,
said City Attorney Joan Chambers. She said residents also use trash
bins at parks and on highways to get rid of household garbage.
   The city's action outraged the couple's friends.
   ``It's a crime, what the city did,'' said Shirley Millikin.
   She said the day the water was turned off, James helped clean up
a city park.
   The Lincoln County commissioners have asked the county health
director to investigate the issue.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Ambasador to Bahrain today
welcomed Iran's acceptance of a U.N. cease-fire resolution, but
U.S. naval officers said they were waiting for official word from
Washington.
   ``It's time for rejoicing,'' said Ambasador Sam H. Zakhem.
``It's beautiful news.'' Zakhem praised President Reagan for
``drumming up support for peace in this part of the world, for
which we have waited so long.''
   Iraq and Iran ``are the true beneficiaries. They've had enough
of the killing and bloodshed,'' he said.
   In Washington, the State Department said it would have no
immediate comment on the Iranian announcement.
   ``Holy cats. You've got to be kidding,'' exclaimed an officer
aboard the navy's command ship Coronado, moored at Bahrain, when
informed of the news by telephone. He said it was the first such
word received aboard the ship.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no
official word had been passed to other U.S. ships in the Persian
Gulf.
   Officers declined to speculate on how quickly or in what way a
cease-fire would affect the navy's operations in the waterway. The
United States now has 27 U.S. warships in and around the Persian
Gulf to guard commercial shipping.
   ``We're taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said the officer.
``Until we hear it from the horse's mouth, we'll just hope for the
best, and see what happens.''
   Rear Adm. Anthony Less, commander of the Persian Gulf-based
naval forces, was not aboard the flagship, but was advised of the
report by telephone.
   A naval source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Less was
``elsewhere'' with a team of U.S. military experts investigating
the July 3 downing of an Iranian jetliner by the U.S. missile
cruiser Vincennes.
   The Vincennes was also anchored off Bahrain but it was not
immediately known if it had received word of the Iranian
announcement.
   Iran's announcement that it would accept U.N. Security Council
Resolution 598 came almost a year to the day after the United
States began escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers to protect them from
Iranian attack.
   The first two Kuwaiti tankers ``reflagged'' by the United States
departed on the initial upbound convoy to Kuwait on July 21, 1987.
   After one of the tankers was damaged by an Iranian mine three
days later, the U.S. government ordered a buildup of forces,
including mine-sweeping helicopters and ships, that more than
tripled the U.S. naval force in the Persian Gulf.

<TEXT>
   Heavy rain drenched parts of the drought-stricken Midwest during
the weekend, but much of the East and parts of California wilted
under hot air that pushed temperatures to record highs.
   The first significant storms in three months dumped more than 2{
inches of rain on parts of Michigan, but weather experts said it
didn't mean an end to the drought. The storms also blacked out at
least 155,000 electricity users and contributed to at least two
deaths, officials said Sunday.
   ``To get a so-called end to the drought, to get us back to a
normal amount of water in the reservoirs, we really need more of a
steady rain over periods of time,'' meteorologist Don Baker said
Sunday in Michigan. ``If it falls too fast, it tends to run off.
What we really need is a lighter rain over a 12- to 24-hour period.
We really need a lot.''
   Iowa had a weekend of feast or famine, with some areas in the
west getting a double drenching while some scorched areas in the
east got little or no rain.
   The first wave of rain was an offshoot of storms that sent
destructive tornadoes roaring through Council Bluffs, and some
places got more than 5 inches of rain.
   ``This is the best rain we've had all year,'' said Melba Wilcox,
who farms with her husband near Bagley, Iowa. She said her rain
gauge showed 2.5 inches fell early Saturday. ``I went outside to
make sure it was real.''
   Scattered thunderstorms spread rain over much of Kansas and into
parts of western Missouri. El Dorado, Kan., got 2.52 inches of rain
in a day and a half and other parts of central and eastern Kansas
got up to 2 inches of rain in 24 hours.
   But to the east and west it was just hot.
   In San Francisco, the city by the bay known for cool weather,
the mercury soared to 103 degrees in downtown Sunday, the city's
highest temperature since record-keeping began 125 years ago.
   The heat heightened the danger of fire and and California
officials closed Mount Diablo State Park in Contra Costa County,
east of San Francisco, and parts of Mount Tamalpais, northwest of
the city.
   On the East Coast, Philadelphia hit a record high for the date
of 102 degrees, which was also a record fifth day in a row of
triple-digit highs. Downtown Baltimore set a record high for the
date of 103 degrees, and that was a record eighth time this year
that the city has hit 100 degrees or better.
   Newark, N.J., set a record-high temperature for the date of 100
degrees, breaking the old high of 99 set in 1977. It was the fifth
time Newark topped 100 degrees this year.
   Eastern Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York were
hit by severe thunderstorms late in the day.
   National Weather Service forecasters said tempertures won't fall
to normal levels in the 80s until Thursday. Forecaster Daryl
Williams blamed the heat on a high-pressure area over the
southwestern United States, which he said is keeping cooler Pacific
air out of the area.

   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards said today her
keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention tonight will
serve as an invitation to ``come on in'' and join her political
party.
   ``I'm not trying to go down in the history books. I'll just try
to communicate and deliver a message,'' she said after a Sunday
training session at the Omni convention hall.
   Today, in an interview on NBC-TV, she said, ``The keynote, I
think, is the person who just sort of opens the door and says,
`Come on in,' and that's what I hope I can do tonight: Talk about
who I am, where I came from, where I think the country has been and
invite the public to join us.''
   Ms. Richards said she felt she was picked as the keynote speaker
because she is from Texas, is a woman and ``I hope because I can
make a good speech.''
   Her nationally televised speech will key on families, she said.
   ``It's not a party issue,'' the divorced mother of four said,
adding, however, that ``the past eight years of Republican
administration has made it harder on family life.''
   Ms. Richards, who as state treasurer handles more than $150
billion worth of transactions a year, said, ``Managing a house is
probably the greatest managememt training in the world. You're
juggling lives. You've got to do it on time. You've got to bring
people to a consensus. You have to allow everyone to save face. All
the decisions have to be decisions that make everyone happy. I
think I bring that to my job.''
   But she said her training and long history of public speaking
have not kept the butterflies away.
   ``I'm terribly nervous. I'm sure I'll just be a jittering fool
by the time I'm supposed to go on,'' she said.

Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A.H. Robins Co. stockholders and Dalkon
Shield claimants have overwhelmingly voted in favor of a
reorganization plan that sets up a $2.5 billion trust fund to
settle lawsuits over the birth control device, a Robins lawyer told
federal judges today.
   Attorney Dennis Drebsky said 98.34 percent of the Dalkon Shield
claimants approved the plan, which includes a $3.2 billion buyout
agreement with American Home Products Corp.
   More than 19 million, or 99.95 percent, of Robins' common
stockholders also voted in favor of the plan. All other classes of
claimants and shareholders voted overwhelmingly for the plan, he
said.
   Robins was driven into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings by
hundreds of thousands of claims filed by women who said they
suffered infections, spontaneous abortions and other injuries from
the use of the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, which Robins
marketed in the early 1970s.
   The reorganization plan calls for claimants to receive payments
from Robins, American Home Products and Aetna Casualty and Surety
Co., which carried liability insurance on the Dalkon Shield.
   The merger agreement provides for the New York-based American
Home Products to pay Robins shareholders $700 million in stock
while paying Robins business creditors in full.
   The results of the voting, which took place from April to June,
were presented to U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. and
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Blackwell Shelley, who have been overseeing
the Robins bankruptcy case.
   Merhige was hearing testimony through the morning from Robins
financial officers and made no immediate comment on the report.
   Drebsky also said Robins has agreed to pay the Internal Revenue
Service about $27 million plus interest. The IRS had sought $62
million from the company.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, acknowledging his link with
Michael Dukakis could upset his conservative Texas supporters, has
asked them to back his Senate re-election campaign ``regardless of
your commitments in the presidential race.''
   The appeal came in a letter sent to supporters after Dukakis,
the probably Democratic presidential nominee, selected Bentsen as
his running mate last Tuesday.
   In the past, many Texas conservatives supported Bentsen, a
former Houston insurance executive, and Republican Vice President
George Bush, another Texan.
   ``I understand that some of my friends will feel that this
latest development creates a predicament for them,'' Bentsen said
in a note from his Austin-based election committee.
   ``Regardless of your commitments in the presidential race, the
campaign for the Senate is vital to Texas and must be vigorously
conducted,'' Bentsen said.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also said he
was grateful for the bi-partisan support he has received.
   Jack DeVore, Bentsen's spokesman, said he did not know how many
of the letters were mailed.
   The day Dukakis announced plans to run with Bentsen, Texas
Commerce Bancshares Chairman Ben Love, who has supported both Bush
and Bentsen summed up his dilemma.
   ``This will produce probably more ulcers than the plunge to $10
per barrel in the price of oil,'' Love said.
   Texas law allows a senator to run for re-election as well as for
vice president.
   If Bentsen were elected to both positions, his successor in the
Senate would be chosen in a special election.
   Polls have shown Bentsen has a strong lead over his Senate
opponent, Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas.

<HEAD>No Evidence of Foul Play Found in 1968 Death of Melvyn Paisley's
Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have uncovered no new information during
an investigation into the 1968 death of the second wife of Melvyn
Paisley, a central figure in a Pentagon procurement scandal, a
newspaper reported.
   Police may close the investigation next week unless new clues
surface, The Seattle Times reported Sunday. Mary Lou Paisley's
death was ruled an accident at the time and there was no formal
police investigation.
   ``We don't even know if there was a crime, because we haven't
got anything to substantiate that,'' said Sgt. Harlan Bollinger.
   Paisley was a Boeing Co. executive at the time of his wife's
death. He left Boeing in 1981 to become assistant secretary of the
Navy, and later became a defense consultant. He has been a central
figure in a Justice Department probe into bid-rigging and bribery
at the Pentagon.
   ``It warranted a much more thorough investigation than was given
back then,'' Bollinger said. ``If something like that happened
today, we would have done a tougher investigation and got all the
information that led up to her death.''
   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella, said Friday that
Paisley had not been contacted by police and ``has no inclination
to dredge up a sad and tragic event that was closed out 20 years
ago.''
   Paisley told authorities in 1968 that his wife, who was an
artist, apparently had gotten up during the night to paint and was
overcome by fumes while cleaning her brushes.
   Police decided that Mrs. Paisley's broken ribs and other
injuries were inflicted inadvertently by firefighters administering
cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the couple's home in the suburb of
Kent.
   Friends and family, however, have questioned the circumstances
of Mrs. Paisley's death. Her body was found in a bathroom, face
down in a pile of towels covered with the toxic solvent carbon
tetrachloride.
   According to the coroner's report, Paisley told authorities that
his wife took two sleeping pills after having a drink and went to
bed.
   But lab tests showed no trace of the paint cleaner, no trace of
the sleeping pills and no alcohol in her bloodstream. An autopsy
listed the cause of death as ``? Drug hypersensitivity.''
   Dr. Donald Reay, county medical examiner, said there is no way
to determine whether the autopsy tests were accurate. The medical
examiner who performed the autopsy died last year.
   The sheriff's office says all police reports on the death were
apparently destroyed in routine purges of non-homicide files.
   A retired police detective, Dick Phillips, however, kept the
only copies of pictures take of Paisley's autopsy.
   ``In my mind, it was never justified, that we never looked into
it,'' said Phillips. He said he kept the photos in part because ``I
felt that the facts of the autopsy disputed the facts of the case
so strongly.''
   Nine months after the death, Paisley married his secretary at
Boeing, Mildred McGetrick. They were divorced in 1980, and he
married computer analyst Vicki McKim.

<HEAD>Excerpts From Iranian Statement On Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iran-Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency
reported today that Iran has accepted U.N. Resolution 598 calling
for an immediate cease-fire with Iraq. IRNA also carried a
statement in English by Iran's General Command of the armed forces
explaining why the resolution was accepted. The following are
excerpts from the statement by the General Command.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The day the oppressive regime of Iraq violated Iran's territory,
the nation fully realized that the savage aggression was the result
of an international plot to damage the Islamic revolution...
   Today new conditions have been created which call for adoption
of new stances in order to continue the sacred defense and protect
Islam and the Islamic revoluton.
   Although the enemies of Islam have not for a moment stopped
their plots against the Islamic revoluton, recently as the blows of
Muslim combatants of Iran on the battered body of Iraq became more
deadly the scope of plots became wider.
   The world arrogance (United States) as well as the reactionaries
came to help Iraq with all their power.
   In order to damage the revolution they did not spare any
criminal act and tried to uphold the Baghdad regime through their
massive military, financial, political, and propaganda assistance,
and armed the Iraqi army with massive weapons and aids for fresh
aggressions and continued crimes...
   Today, the whole reactionary and arrogant worlds are trying to
portray our enemy which has committed unprecedented crimes in the
history of the world as a peace-loving regime and on the contrary
misportray our innocent and resistant nation which has always
sought, and still is seeking to thwart the aggression, as
war-mongering Muslims before world public opinion...
   In addition, they (arrogant and reactionary worlds) put utmost
pressure on Iran and threaten the Iranian nation.
   Under such circumstances, it is natural for us to try to expose
the aggressor and prevent the enemies of Islam and those who are
against the independence of nations from taking initiative in
international scenes.
   The announcement of the Islamic Republic's new stand to U.N.
Chief Javier Perez de Cuellar is aimed at implementing this new
policy.
   It is beyond question that defending Islam and acting bravely is
not an act peculiar only to the battlefields but that adoption of
new methods which can tip the balance to the advantage of Islam and
foil enemy plots speaks for courage in its own right.
   At this crucial juncture, the armed forces General Command
headquarters ... deems it necessary to stress the following points:
   1. In continuation of the previous statements released by the
armed forces General Command headquarters we once again urge the
Iranian people to man the war fronts to confront enemies'
aggressive nature and foil their criminal acts. Our brave military
commanders are still doing all within their power to continue
safeguarding the Islamic revolution...
   2. What has happened is expedient by divine assignment...
   3. The great leadership of Imam Khomeini who has successfully

   Drug abuse and crime are the most important
issues to urban residents when deciding how to cast presidential
ballots, according to a survey Democrats released today by the
National League of Cities.
   The telephone study of 50 local government delegates and
alternates to the Democratic National Convention showed that urban
officials expect the next president to pilot the fight against
drugs.
   ``There is a distinct feeling that the White House must take
leadership on the drug problem,'' said Alan Beals, the league's
executive director.
   The poll found 42 percent identified drugs and crime as the most
prominent issues, followed by jobs and training, 21 percent;
partnership with local government, 13 percent; education, 10
percent; poverty and housing, 10 percent; children, 2 percent, and
infrastructure, 2 percent.
   The urban leaders said jobs and training, not drugs, were the
most important issue for congressional candidates.
   A majority _ 57 percent _ said the Democratic candidate should
address the issue of a tax increase.

   Iraq's information minister today said
Iran accepted a United Nations cease-fire resolution for tactical
reasons and not out of any desire for peace.
   In the first official reaction from Baghdad to Iran's
announcement today that it was accepting U.N. Security Council
Resolution 598, the official, Nassif Ltayyif Jassem, said Iraq had
``reservations.''
   ``Our previous knowledge of the devious Iranian regime makes us
be cautious and wary until peace is achieved and until we reach an
agreement between Iran and Iraq for peace,'' he said.
   ``We haven't been officially apprised of the Iranian letter to
the United Nations. We are still dealing with news we learned about
by listening to Tehran radio,'' he said in statements reported by
the Iraqi News Agency.
   ``The Iranian General Command's statement did not explain the
reasons behind Iran's new stand in terms of a desire for a real and
just peace, but mentioned the circumstances and reasons for their
latest position in terms of tactical reasons,'' he was quoted as
saying in a report monitored in Nicosia.
   Jassem appeared to be referring to a portion of the statement by
the Iranian General Command which said the ``arrogant worlds,'' a
reference to the United States, had sought to portray Iraq as a
``peace-loving regime'' because of Baghdad's previous acceptance of
Security Resolution Resolution 598.
   Iraq accepted the resolution immediately after it passed, but
only on condition it was also accepted by Iran.
   The Iranian General Command statement advocated a ``new policy''
to ``expose the aggressor'' and ``prevent the enemies of Islam ...
from taking the initiative on the international scene.''
   ``The announcement of the Islamic Republic's new stands to U.N.
chief Javier Perez de Cuellar is aimed at implementing this new
policy,'' Iraqi statement said.
   The Iraqi information minister pointed out that ``the statement
of the General Command described Iraq as hostile, not changing the
old language.''
   Referring to a portion of the Iranian statement which called for
``defending Islam,'' Jassem said this amounted to a call for
``aggression and expansionism.''
   ``He who wants peace does not have to call for massing troops on
the front,'' he said, a reference to the Iranian General Command's
call for Iranians to man the front.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Sunday called on Iran's rulers
to agree to an ``honorable'' end to the war.
   ``Iran's rulers have to accept the peace road, they have to
abandon their unjust dreams and foolish mottos and slogans, their
hollow illusions after their defeats,'' the Iraqi leader said in
urging the Iranian leaders to accept the U.N. resolution.
   Iraq accepted Resolution 598 immediately after it was passed on
July 20 of last year, but only on condition Iran abided by it, too.

of Iranian President Ali Khamenei's letter to the U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar accepting Security

   Democratic nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis and
Jesse Jackson emerged from two hours of pre-convention unity talks
today and said they would work together to win the White House from
the Republicans this fall.
   At a news conference a few hours before the rap of the opening
gavel at the convention, Jackson made no explicit pledge to support
Dukakis' nomination. But he signaled harmony when he said he had
``no plans'' to challenge Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's nomination for
vice president and would offer ``no encouragement'' to anyone
seeking to do so.
   Dukakis said Jackson ``will be a very important member of this
team'' that Democrats put together for the fall.
   ``We'll be campaigning together, and we'll be campaigning
separately,'' said the man certain to win the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   The news conference came at the end of private discussions in
Dukakis' hotel suite, and both men appeared in excellent spirits.
   Dukakis praised his rival lavishly for his efforts in
registering voters, and said, ``I want Jesse Jackson to play a
major role in this campaign. I want his supporters who are out
there by the millions to be out there in the fall.''
   Asked about Jackson's insistence on a role in any transition to
a Democratic administration should the party win the White House,
Dukakis said that wasn't discussed.
   ``Once we've won the victory, if we can build the kind of
bond...that we think we can, the rest will take care of itself.''
   Jackson said his name would be entered into nomination for
president Wednesday night, and he was hoping for a ``miracle.''
   But, he added, ``if the miracle does not come to pass then we
will pass over to next phase of our campaign.''
   He listened closely to Dukakis' description of their
discussions, and said, ``The governor has adequately defined the
relationship.''
   ``I seek no job, no salary, no title. I seek to serve, to keep
America strong, to make America better,'' he said.
   In television interviews just before the two men met on the day
the Democratic convention opens, Dukakis spoke in general terms of
the issues that sources say are in question. Jackson is seeking the
right to appoint additional members of the Democratic National
Committee and wants a significant role in any transition apparatus
created for a new Democratic administration.
   Jackson, Dukakis' sole remaining challenger, also wants the
party to finance his campaign travels, the sources said.
   ``We will have some at-large members of the DNC and I suspect
there will be a good representation which reflects the kind of
strength that people have at the convention,'' Dukakis said today
on NBC-TV.
   The Massachusetts governor also promised to reach out to various
groups of people in forming his administration if he is victorious
in the general election. He said of Jackson, ``He is going to be an
important part of our team as we go into November,'' he said.
   But Dukakis added, ``There can be only one quarterback on that
team, only one person who throws the ball and calls the signals,
and that has to be the president of the United States.''
   Separately, Dukakis was reported to be considering a proposal to
appoint a transition planning group shortly after this week's
Democratic National Convention wraps up business.
   Officials said Marcia Hale, who has played a key role in
organizing the convention for Dukakis, was being considered to
direct the transition group.
   The talks between Dukais and Jackson are intended to result in a
unified party convention. The sources who discussed the
negotiations spoke only on condition they not be identified.
   These sources said that while some platform issues remained
unresolved, they were not viewed as the main stumbling blocks to an
agreement.
   Instead, the talks have centered largely on Jackson's call for
increased clout within the Democratic National Committee, his
desire to be seen as an official representative of the party in the
fall campaign and his proposal to be included in any transition
planning should Dukakis be elected.
   Dukakis sources said Sunday night that any decision on a Jackson
role in transition arrangements should wait until after the
November election.
   Jackson has demanded an officially sanctioned role in the fall
campaign, including financial support from Dukakis. It was not
clear whether Jackson had specifically asked Dukakis to furnish him
a chartered jet of his own.
   A Dukakis source said the Massachusetts governor would welcome
campaign efforts by Jackson, particularly in voter registration,
but that any funds would have to come from the party.
   The sources said Jackson is seeking the right to appoint two or
three dozen at-large members to the Democratic National Committee,
a step that would increase his clout in the party structure.
   Dukakis has said he will not consider any proposals to remove
party chairman Paul Kirk, who annoyed Jackson last week when he
traveled to Boston to introduce Dukakis and his choice of Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his vice vice presidential running mate.
   For his part, Dukakis was eager to see Bentsen's nomination go
unchallenged on Thursday night.

<TEXT>
   Douglas ``Wrong Way'' Corrigan returned
here today for ceremonies commemorating his famous wrong turn 50
years ago that led him to fly thousands of miles east instead of
west, to Ireland instead of California.
   ``Look, no hands,'' the 81-year-old American declared, hands
aloft in a triumphant gesture, as the Aer Lingus plane carrying him
from Dublin landed at Baldonnel Airport after a 10-minute flight.
   First to greet him at Baldonnel, now Irish air force
headquarters, was R.W. O'Sullivan, the aviation engineer who met
him the first time he landed in Dublin, in 1938.
   U.S. Ambassador Margaret Heckler told the aviator: ``I'm so
proud of you. You are amazing.''
   Corrigan's first transatlantic hop as pilot of a $900 monoplane
was forbidden by U.S. officials, who said his plane wasn't safe. He
said he would fly back to Long Beach, Calif., but somehow he landed
in Ireland anyhow.
   This time, Corrigan arrived in Ireland by commercial jet for
festivities celebrating his famed wrong-way flight, then boarded
the Shorts-360 propellor plane, renamed WW2 (for ``wrong way'') in
his honor, and flew to Baldonnel in the cockpit.
   He sported the same leather flying jacket he wore on his first
flight.
   Corrigan flew from New York as an honored passenger of Aer
Lingus, the Irish Airline, on a Boeing 747. He wouldn't say in an
interview before his dekparture from Kennedy International Airport
Sunday night if the true story of what happened 50 years ago might
come out during his visit to Ireland.
   But Corrigan, of Santa Ana, Calf., hinted recently that his
``wrong-way'' explanation may change after he arrives in Dublin.
Nevertheless, he stuck to his story during the initial ceremony
today.
   Before his departure, Corrigan was whisked in a New York Police
Department helicopter to the Brooklyn airfield for a nostalgic
visit.
   ``It looks a little different than it did 50 years ago. It's got
more buildings scattered around,'' he said. ``But the runway is
still there and the control tower.''
   His Aer Lingus flight was delayed for several hours because of
rain in New York. When he took off from Floyd Bennett Field in
Brooklyn on July 17, 1938, ``it wasn't raining at all,'' the
81-year-old Corrigan recalled. It took him 28 hours to get to
Dublin.
   ``When I saw the water I didn't think it was the Pacific, but at
that time I was in the air for 26 hours and when I came down
through the clouds I noticed I had been reading the compass needle
backwards,'' he told Irish state radio.
   ``That was when I first realized I had been going east instead
of west,'' he said.
   Today's flight took about six hours, and Corrigan did not seem
to be suffering from the effects of jet lag when he arrived in
Ireland this morning.
   ``I believe he's in splendid form. We had plans he'd rest for a
while but he really wasn't interested in that,'' said Margaret
Coyne, an Aer Lingus spokeswoman in Dublin. Corrigan is staying in
Dublin as a guest of Aer Lingus, which plans three days of
ceremonies.
   On July 18, 1938, when he first touched down in Ireland, he only
had $3 in his pocket and didn't know anyone, Corrigan said.
   On his arrival in Dublin a half century ago, Corrigan claimed,
``My compass froze. I guess I flew the wrong way.''
   He has steadfastly maintained he thought he was returning to his
home base of Long Beach, Calif., after federal aviation authorities
said his used Curtiss-Robin monoplane was too heavy for a safe
flight to Ireland.
   The Bureau of Air Commerce, forerunner of the Federal Aviation
Administration, suspended Corrigan from flying for five days after
he made his unauthorized flight.
   But America and Ireland loved his explanation. After he returned
to New York, he was given a ticker-tape parade. There was a meeting
with President Franklin Roosevelt, and a movie, ``The Flying
Irishman,'' starring Corrigan as himself.
   Corrigan, a woodworker, was inspired to try aviation when he
helped build the ``Spirit of St. Louis,'' which Charles Lindbergh
flew across the ocean in 1927. He bought his plane for $310 in 1931
and spent $590 modifying it.
   Also present at the ceremony welcoming Corrigan to Ireland were
Transport Minister John Wilson, Dublin's deputy lord mayor Alice
Glenn, and Aer Lingus chief executive David Kennedy, who wished ``a
hearty cead mile failte -- 100,000 welcomes _ to Mr. Douglas `Wrong
Way' Corrigan.''

   After the smiles and kind words exchanged by
Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis today, Jackson still faced the
challenge of keeping his delegates _ many of whom passionately
believe he should have a place on the ticket _ in line with him at
the Democratic convention.
   Jackson was to meet today with his delegates to keep open the
lines of communication and give them an idea about what to expect
from the convention.
   He and Dukakis were talking unity at an upbeat news conference
after their private meeting today. Jackson said he had no plans to
have his name put in nomination for vice president or to encourage
supporters to do so in opposition to Dukakis' choice.
   Though he said his name still would be formally offered for the
presidential nomination, Jackson acknowledged with a smile that it
would take ``a Chicago miracle'' for him to beat Dukakis, who
clinched the nomination in the primaries.
   Jackson has been telling his followers to take it one day at a
time. But even while stressing the need for discipline among his
supporters, he also keeps them fired up with the call to ``never
surrender.''
   `I have one gear. It's forward. Never backward, never sideways.
I will never surrender. You must never surrender,'' he told a
cheering crowd of close ot 4,000 at a Sunday night's glittering
stage tribute to him featuring singer Al Green and other performers.
   On the day before the opening of the Democratic convention, as
aides were working diligently to set up today's meeting between
Jackson and Dukakis, Jackson campaigned around Atlanta _ preaching
at a church service, speaking to a labor convocation, talking to
the Democratic National committee's Black Caucus.
   He also raised money to fuel his new political action committee,
called Keep Hope Alive. It will give political contributions to
office seekers who espouse a progressive agenda.
   Jackson predicted Sunday the Democrats would have ``a great
convention'' but not necessarily a quiet one because he wants to
debate the platform issues on which he and Dukakis disagree.
   Formal talks on the platform were suspended by Jackson, who was
miffed last week when Dukakis failed to tell him ahead of time
about his vice presidential choice.
   ``We can afford to lose a point on the floor but not our
integrity,'' he told the DNC Black Caucus session where he raised
money for his PAC.
   Later, at the entertainment tribute, he said ``those who are
afraid to debate a different point of view _ that's the politics of
hysteria.''
   Earlier, he told labor union delegates that the convention was
``not a coronation. ... We're not threatening to leave the
convention. We're talking about threatening to stay.''
   Jackson made it clear the question of his name being entered for
the vice presidential nomination wasn't settled, and that
differences over the platform remained.
   He asked delegates to wait and see how they're treated before
deciding what to do on the vice presidential question _ a clear
reference to the meetings with the Dukakis campaign over Jackson's
future role in the campaign and the party.
   However, he suggested that the tension between the two camps
wasn't all that big a problem.
   ``We've seen conventions where candidates were coming into the
conventions attacking each other personally, gouging each other,''
Jackson said. ``In 1968, there were riots. That will not happen in
Atlanta.''
   In fact, he said, internal debate ``is the best tradition of our
party. It's good for our party. Our time is upon us now. We're
fighting the right fight.''
   ``You cannot have new life without some pain. Whenever we've
made progress, real progress, it's always through creative tension.
America, we're about to have a great convention,'' he declared.

   Race has been ruled out as a motive for
the slaying of a young black woman found with ``KKK'' scratched
into her thighs, police said.
   A black man, Jeffrey Allen Dawson, 29, of Kingston, was being
held without bail in the Ulster County jail in the death. Police
said Sunday that Dawson knew the victim, Anna Kithcart, 19, of
Kingston, and that both were drug abusers.
   Dawson was arrested late Saturday and pleaded innocent to a
second-degree murder charge this morning at his arraigment in City
Court.
   The young woman's partially clad body was found Tuesday morning
behind Kingston Hospital.
   Kingston police Detective Michael Turck said Sunday that any
racial motive in the case has now been ruled out, despite early
speculation that it might be race related because of the KKK
inscription, presumed to represent the initials of the Ku Klux Klan.
   Dawson and the victim were both seen at the Royal Grill bar
Monday evening just before Miss Kithcart's death. But Turck said
police were not sure whether they were together or if they left at
the same time.
   Sometime afterward, police said, the two apparently got into an
argument behind the hospital, a few blocks from the bar. Kithcart's
body showed evidence of strangulation and a blow to the head. The
exact cause of death has not been released.
   ``There is evidence of drug use and abuse prevalent throughout
this case. Dawson's actions were not racially motivated,'' said
Turck. Dawson was a suspect in the case from the beginning, he said.
   Investigators speculated the letters ``KKK'' may have been
carved onto the victim after she was killed.
   Also charged in the case is a transient and former mental
patient who is accused of sexually abusing the victim's corpse.
Joseph Kiernan, 41, was not considered a suspect in the death,
although police said they believe he may have carved the initials.
   Police have obtained a handwriting sample from Kiernan and are
awaiting test results to determine whether it matches the writing
of the person who inscribed the initials, Assistant District
Attorney John Prizzia said.
   Miss Kithcart's father has said his daughter was a drug abuser.
``I'm almost positive it was a drug rub,'' Eugene Kithcart said
last week.
   Kingston is located about 25 miles north of Wappingers Falls, on
the opposite shore of the Hudson River. Last November, 16-year-old
Tawana Brawley of Wappingers Falls was found with the letters
``KKK'' and racial epithets scrawled in a charcoal-like substance
on her skin after she was missing for four days.
   She later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of
white men, but she and her family have refused to cooperate with a
state investigation.

   Police bans and tight security
prevented major public celebrations on Nelson Mandela's 70th
birthday today, but his wife said the day still focused attention
on ``the crimes of apartheid.''
   Celebrations, protests and church services were planned in at
least 30 countries and world leaders issued statements condemning
the imprisonment of the leader of the outlawed African National
Congress.
   But in South Africa, police banned events related to Mandela's
birthday.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, told a news conference in Johannesburg
she was disappointed that the planned celebrations, including a
Sunday concert in the Soweto township, had been prohibited.
   ``We had every intention of conveying a message of goodwill and
of hope with that concert,'' she said.
   ``We wanted this to be a peaceful day,'' Mrs. Mandela said.
``It's our own way of focusing on the crimes of apartheid.''
   She said she was humbled by the worldwide attention focused on
her husband, probably the world's best known and most influential
prisoner.
   Mrs. Mandela said her husband was ``in perfect health'' and
``completely aware of everything that's going on (around the
world).''
   But she said Mandela has been isolated in a prison hospital
since undergoing a prostate operation two years ago. He must
petition prison officials to see other inmates and is allowed only
40-minute visits, she said.
   More than 1,000 students attended an indoor service at the
University of the Western Cape, made up mostly of mixed-race
students.
   Also, anti-apartheid activist Rev. Alan Boesak called for
Mandela's release in a service at St. Francis Catholic Church in
the black township of Langa. There were no reports of incidents at
either location.
   Police have refused to grant permission for outdoor gatherings
and none was scheduled.
   Police maintained a visible presence at many school campuses
today. They also dismissed students at several black schools in
Cape Town to prevent confrontations.
   Authorities broke up a planned meeting at the Bontehewel high
school in the mixed-race township of Athlone outside Cape Town and
sent students home.
   Late Sunday night, a house was burned down on property north of
Johannesburg where an amateur soccer game and tea party were to be
held in Mandela's honor Saturday. The owner, Miranda Harris, said
police vehicles had parked in front of the house and obtained a
court order banning the party.
   Beeld, the pro-government Afrikaans-language daily, said in an
editorial today there would never be a better time to release
Mandela from prison.
   The paper said Mandela served his ``propaganda war'' better in
jail than he would as a free man. Birthday wishes from around the
world, the paper said, proved Mandela had acquired a status
``larger than life'' that he would have a hard time maintaining out
of jail.
   The country's leading financial daily, Business Day, criticized
the government's strategy of banning birthday celebrations.
   ``There is nothing the (government) could have done which would
have been more effective in building the legend of Nelson
Mandela,'' the newspaper said.
   Meanwhile, security forces, some in armored vehicles, patrolled
the country's major black townships, though there were no reports
of violence.
   Police also set up several roadblocks, including one outside
Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison, where Mandela is held.
   In the past week, more than 30 people involved in birthday
events in the Cape Town area have been arrested.
   Mrs. Mandela last week rejected a government offer to have a
six-hour visit with her husband on his birthday, deciding to focus
attention on other prisoners held for anti-apartheid activities,
said the family's attorney, Ismail Ayob.
   The visit, which would have been the couple's longest reunion
since Mandela was jailed 26 years ago, was a special concession by
prison authorities, who normally grant only 40-minute visits.
   Mrs. Mandela planned to stay home and would likely to visit her
husband later in the week, Ayob said.
   Mandela is probably the world's best known and most influential
prisoner, and his birthday has drawn worldwide attention.
   The countries whose governments have called for Mandela's
release in the past few days include: Britain, Japan, West Germany,
East Germany, Canada, Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway and Sweden.
   Mandela was jailed in 1962 for leaving the country illegally and
inciting unrest. While serving a five-year term, he was sentenced
to life imprisonment in 1964 for sabotage and plotting the
overthrow of the white minority government.
   Most of South Africa's 26 million blacks have never seen Mandela
or heard him speak because it is illegal to publish his picture or
quote his words in South Africa. Yet he has become the embodiment
of black resistance to apartheid.

   Michael Dukakis, ready to claim the Democratic
presidential nomination, pledged today ``a campaign that will reach
out to literally millions'' and include rival Jesse Jackson as well
some of his campaign staff.
   Dukakis, who canceled his morning schedule to meet for more than
two hours with Jackson, emerged predicting party unity while saying
``there's no deal and there's no fine print'' between the two
candidates.
   The meeting was their first since Dukakis passed over Jackson in
selecting a running mate. Dukakis said negotiations over platform
differences would resume between the two campaigns.
   He said he wanted Jackson campaigning for the ticket and some
members of his staff included into the Dukakis organization.
   ``He will be doing everything he possibly can and I want him to
do everything he can,'' Dukakis said. ``We'll be campaigning
together, we'll be campaigning separately _ but he'll be a very,
very important part of this team.''
   ``It will be a campaign that will reach out to literally
millions and millions and millions of Americans and say to them,
`this is your country, this is your government,''' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis planned a late lunch in the afternoon with Jimmy Carter
at the former president's library in Atlanta.
   The apparent nominee relaxed with his family and running mate at
a cousin's swank restaurant Sunday night and suggested conciliation
with Jackson, his last remaining rival, is within reach. ``We're
going to need Jesse'' in the fall, Dukakis said.
   In order to hold the personal session with Jackson and try to
negotiate an end to their campaign tensions, Dukakis scrapped a
visit to a General Motors plant aimed at underscoring his themes of
jobs and economic opportunity. Spokesman Dayton Duncan said Dukakis
set up the meeting in a 15-minute late-night call.
   Dukakis aides said privately that there were sticking points,
including whether Dukakis or the party would sponsor Jackson's fall
campaign effort and travel for the prospective Democratic nominee.
But they held out hope agreement could be reached in the
face-to-face session.
   After signing legislation to settle Massachusetts' budget
problems, Dukakis left Boston for this sweltering city where he
will be nominated Wednesday.
   But first there was time out for a family celebration. Dukakis
and his wife, Kitty, and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and his wife, Beryl
Ann, spent part of the evening at 103 West, a swank continental
restaurant that is one of several owned by Dukakis' second cousin
Pano Karatassos. They dined on a six-course meal that included
lobster and red snapper ragout in sauterne sauce.
   Other Democratic leaders were there in separate parties,
including Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, Hawaii Sen. Daniel
Inouye, and Pennsylvania Rep. William Gray.
   Upon his arrival in Atlanta, Dukakis praised Jackson, who has
refused to concede him the nomination or endorse his selection of a
running mate. But Dukakis predicted the convention would produce a
unified party to mount a winning campaign in the fall.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I are going to need your help,'' Dukakis
said at a reception for selected Democrats. ``We're going to need
Jesse. We're going to need all of the delegates at this
convention.''
   Before leaving Boston, Dukakis expressed confidence that Jackson
will be a member of his team but emphasized that it will have only
one quarterback _ the presidential nominee.
   ``You can't have two quarterbacks,'' he said. ``On the other
hand, every team has to have terrific players in the backfield, up
on the line. That's the way you win and that's the way we're going
to win.''
   He rejected talk of convention tension as ``the stuff of
politics.''
   Dukakis stopped in Washington on his way down to pick up
Bentsen, the Texas senator he selected last week to be his vice
presidential candidate.
   Both appeared relaxed and buoyant as they entered the city and
arrived at a reception hosted by television entrepreneur Ted Turner
in the spacious atrium of the CNN Center next door to The Omni,
where the convention opens Monday evening.
   Dukakis stood on the stage in front of a glittering, giant
American flag and shook hands with Carter, and later greeted former
House Speaker Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill outside.
   Sharing the stage also were Georgia's two Democratic senators,
Sam Nunn and Wyche Fowler, Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, head of
the committee that wrote a Dukakis-approved platform, and Turner,
owner of the Cable News Network and Atlanta professional sports
teams.
   ``For the past 17 months I've had Georgia on my mind,'' Dukakis
declared.

   Here is a transcript of remarks Monday by Michael
Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Lloyd Bentsen to reporters after Dukakis
and Jackson held unity talks before the opening of the Democratic
National Convention.
   Dukakis: If I could have your attention, please. ...
   We wondered if we could get a crowd, and I guess we've gotten a
pretty good one.
   This campaign that we're about to wage is about the future of
the American dream.
   It's about hope, it's about optimism, it's about creating
opportunity for every single citizen in this country.
   That's what I believe. That's what Jesse Jackson believes.
That's what Lloyd Bentsen believes.
   That's what separates us as Democrats from the Republican Party.
   We have had a very, very good talk this morning ... about this
campaign, about our convention, and about what we're going to do
together ...
   And I want to begin by saying a word about Reverend Jesse
Jackson.
   Because you can't go through what he and I have gone through for
the past 16 months and many years before that without developing
enormous respect and genuine friendship ... somebody who has done
what he has done, who has not only competed so successfully in this
toughest of all political tests, the campaign for the presidency of
the United States, but has probably registered more people as
voters than anybody in this country, has reached out and been able
to involve and win the support of literally millions and millions
of Americans, many of whom were never a part of the political
process, many of whom are young, are people that he and I and
Senator Bentsen hope in this campaign and beyond that we can make a
part of this country's political process, a part of our government,
and people that we encourage to get into public service, and stay
in public service, and serve their country and serve their
community.
   He has reached out not only to friends and supporters and
advocates in the black community, but he has reached out to farm
families, to working families, he's won support in Vermont, won
support in Wisconsin, won support in Oregon, won support all over
this country.
   And I want Jesse Jackson to play a major role in this campaign.
I want his supporters, who are out there by the millions, to be
deeply involved in this campaign. They are going to be an essential
part of the coalition we build coming out of this convention to win
a Democratic victory in November and to provide this nation with
strong, new, hopeful, confident and optimistic leadership in
January.
   And he is going to be involved actively, and fully, in a way
that will bring us together and will build the strongest grassroots
community-to-community organization, we hope, that has ever been
organized in a presidential campaign.
   I would like him to say a few words to you about our
discussions, about his hopes, dreams and aspirations, the role that
we both want him and his supporters to play in this campaign. And
then we've both asked Senator Bentsen to say a few words and then
we'll be, all of us, open for questions.
   Jackson: No questions.
   Dukakis: No questions? (Laughter.)
   Are you kidding.
   No questions from Donaldson? (Laughter.)
   I don't mind, Sam.
   That's Jesse talking. I don't mind (Laughter.)
   I like his questions.
   So, let me present to you with great pride, a man who I have
come to know, and like, and respect, because we've campaigned
together, up and down across this country, a great leader, an
inspirational leader, who has inspired millions and millions of
people to become a part of American politics and we hope, beginning
in January, a part of American government, Reverend Jesse Jackson.

   An Ohio member of the Rules Committee of the
Democratic National Convention collapsed on a dance floor at his
hotel today and died shortly afterward of a heart attack, party
officials said.
   Jack E. Wolf, 62, of Lorain, Ohio, was attending a party at the
Pierremont Plaza Hotel given by Ohio Secretary of State Sherrod
Brown and by West Virginia Attorney General Charlie Brown. He
collapsed while dancing at about 12:10 a.m. and died at Crawford
Long Hospital.
   ``Jack Wolf died the way he would have wanted to _ dancing with
Democrats,'' said Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste. ``The only thing he
would have preferred to do would have been counting ballots for a
Democratic victory in November 1988.''
   Wolf had been honored as Democrat of the Year in 1987 by the
Ohio party. He is survived by a sister in Dayton.

Picks up 7th graf, ``The Presidium ...''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet leadership today rejected a bid by a
predominantly Armenian region to secede from the republic of
Azerbaijan in a bitter territorial dispute that has sparked five
months of unrest in the Caucasus.
   ``The presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. confirmed
today that Nagorno-Karabakh belongs to Azerbaijan,'' the official
Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The decision at the special session was unanimous, even though
Armenia _ which has supported the effort by the region of
Nogorno-Karabakh to separate from Azerbaijan _ is represented on
the Presidium.
   At the same time, the Presidium ``made provision for measures
that would ensure the region's real autonomy as well as
unconditional fulfullment of a comprehensive program for its social
economic and culutural development,'' Tass said. The Presidium is
the government's highest executive body.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been part of the mostly Moslem Soviet
republic since 1923, although three-quarters of its 160,000
inhabitants are ethnic Armenians, who are predominantly Christian.
   On July 12, the legislature of the Delaware-sized district voted
to secede from Azerbaijan and join neighboring Armenia, but
Azerbaijan's government voided the decision hours later, calling it
illegal.
   The 1977 Soviet Constitution requires that any of the nation's
15 constituent republics agree before any change can be made in its
borders.
   Both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, which has voted to accept the
region, asked the central Soviet leadership to intervene in the
dispute, which has kept the Caucasus on the boil with ethnic
tensions since February and has triggered strikes that have cost
more than $100 million.
   The Presidium, headed by President Andrei A. Gromyko, has more
than 30 members and includes top government and Communist Party
officials including Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party's general
secretary, and top leaders from all 15 republics.
   Tass said representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan and
Nagorno-Karabakh would first deliver reports to the Presidium and
that members of the executive body would take part in the debate.
It gave no estimate of how long the meeting might last or when a
decision could be expected.
   Because of the constitutional provision that gives Azerbaijan an
effective veto over any change in Nagorno-Karabakh's status, it was
uncertain what moves the Presidium might take.
   Tass said Gromyko opened the session by noting that the
situation in Nagorno-Karabakh had worsened since the Presidium last
discussed the issue on March 23, when it rejected as
``intolerable'' the Armenian campaign for annexation.
   ``The search for the right solution,'' the 78-year-old Soviet
head of state declared, ``should be conducted within the framework
of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R., socialist values and mutual
respect for the opinion, traditions and national dignity of every
people.'
   Gromyko's reference to the Constitution may have signified
high-level opposition to the transfer of sovereignty.
   Any action taken by the Moscow leadership will be keenly
followed by other ethnic groups now demanding more say about their
future, including the Baltic peoples of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia and the Crimean Tatars.
   The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh began in February, when the
mountainous region's legislature voted to ask Azerbaijan and
Armenia to consent to the transfer of sovereignty.
   Armenia's legislature agreed June 15, but Azerbaijan's
parliament rejected the request two days later, setting the stage
for the breakaway declaration by Nagorno-Karabakh's lawmakers.
   The dispute has triggered street demonstrations and strikes by
Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia itself since February. It
has sparked ethnic violence, including rioting on Feb. 28 in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait in which 32 people, 26 of them
Armenians, were killed.
   Gorbachev made a personal appeal for calm to the people of
Armenia and Azerbaijan on Feb. 26, but the turmoil only briefly
subsided.
   A multimillion dollar economic and social development plan
announced by the government and party for Nagorno-Karabakh also
failed to placate Armenians, who consider the enclave part of their
historic homeland.
   Since May 23, a general strike has shut down industries and
offices in Stepanakert, the administrative center of
Nagorno-Karabakh, and a sympathy strike called July 4 in Armenia
and its capital, Yerevan, has persuaded thousands to stay off the
job.
   Yerevan party chief M.S. Minasbekyan told Armenians on
television that ``in the days of strikes, the republic has lost
some 70 million rubles ($113 million),'' the official Tass news
agency reported from Yerevan late Sunday.
   Minasbekyan said that for each day the strike continues, 32
apartments will go unbuilt.
   Tass reported over the weekend that ``the situation in the
Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region is becoming more tense with the
approach'' of today's meeting of the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet.

   An unexploded bomb dropped by a
U.S. military airplane during World War II was disovered in the
Rhine River west of Frankfurt on Monday, police said.
   The 550-pound bomb was discovered about 80 miles west of
Frankfurt by a team of divers from the water and shipping offices
during a routine check of buoy anchors on the riverbed.
   Demolition experts were called in to defuse the bomb, and
shipping traffic on the river was halted for about 15 minutes,
police said in a statement to the news media.
   Unexploded World War II bombs and other ammunition are
frequently uncovered in West Germany. They are often discovered
during excavation for construction sites.
   The bomb found Monday was located about 330 feet from the shore
of the West German town of Ruedesheim, a picturesque village
popular with tourists.

   Six dead seals were found in
Limfjorden Bay, signaling the possible spread of a herpes virus
that has claimed hundreds of the mammals in north European waters.
   The carcasses had drifted ashore in the Limfjorden, which
stretches across the northern part of the Jutland peninsula. The
bay, previously untouched by the virus, is home to about 800 seals.
   Tests by the State Veterinary Serum Laboratory showed that they
died of acute pneumonia, caused by the same virus that has killed
seals in Danish and German waters, according to Danish Radio.
   The epidemic is caused by a herpes virus believed linked to
pollution.
   The seal population in Limfjorden is the third biggest in Danish
waters, and experts were hoping that it would be saved from
disease, since the bay is virtually sealed off from other waters,
the report said.

<HEAD>Shultz to Take Up Trade Issues Tuesday With Japan Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who lashed out
at South Korea's closed-market economy, is expected to take up
trade issues Tuesday when he meets Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
and other Japanese leaders.
   In contrast to South Korea, however, both sides here have noted
progress in tackling the trade problems that have marred
U.S.-Japanese ties.
   ``Things are moving in the right direction. It's a different
atmosphere now,'' a senior U.S. State Department source said as
Shultz began his 40-hour Tokyo visit.
   A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said last week that Japan
has agreed to liberalize its imports of American beef and citrus;
is opening up public works contracts to American construction
companies; and is reducing its vast trade surplus with the United
States.
   ``We can't be complacent, but we have shown the world how to
cope with the problem,'' the Japanese official said, speaking
anomyously.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, which stood at about $60
billion last year, is expected to shrink by $5 billion to $10
billion by the end of 1988.
   But Japanese officials are in turn concerned about a U.S.
congressional trade bill that is widely regarded in Asia as
protectionist. Growing protectionism in the United States has been
a key theme of Shultz's nearly completed nine-country swing through
Asia and the Pacific.
   Shultz, a staunch advocate of free market economics, was
critical of South Korea's efforts to keep American beef, citrus,
cigarettes and other products out of that country's booming
domestic economy.
   ``An awful lot of people have said to me that you shouldn't keep
pressing for these market-opening measures because it's causing
Koreans to be anti-Amerian,'' Shultz said before departing Seoul
for Tokyo. ``And I have to say, well, if that causes you to be
anti-American, help yourself.''
   ``Sometimes it seems to us that everyone wants the U.S. market
to be open and that's as far as it goes,'' he said. ``That's not an
open world trading system. It's got to be reciprocal.''
   South Korea's dynamic economic growth has been fueled by exports
to the United States, with which it enjoyed a trade surplus of
about $10 billion. Public resentment of U.S. pressure to open
Korean markets has increased anti-American sentiment.
   In Seoul, Shultz also pledged American military support in event
North Korea tries to disrupt the upcoming Olympics in the South
Korean capital.
   ``Military aggression will be deterred. That's what our forces
are here for,'' Shultz told reporters. ``I think being prepared is
the answer to preventing aggression from taking place.''
   Voicing confidence in a terrorist-free Olympiad, Shultz said if
Pyongyang staged any attack it would ``be an aggression against the
whole world ... The whole world will be watching.''
   Shultz quoted South Korean leaders as expressing the seemingly
``universal opinion'' that the United States maintain its troops in
South Korea until tensions with the North subside. The U.S. has
42,000 troops in South Korea under an agreement made following the
Korean War.
   Shultz stressed that Washington supported recent Seoul efforts
at reconciliation with North Korea, but said the United States
would itself move cautiously in dealing with a nation he described
as ``terrorist.''
   In Tokyo, Shultz also is expected to discuss problems in
Cambodia and Korea, the future of U.S. military bases in the
Philippines, and a multilateral plan to rehabilitate the ailing
Philippine economy.

<HEAD>Dukakis Vows End to GOP Red Ink AND War on Social Maladies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is promising to wage war on
drugs, homelessness and poverty if elected president, but he isn't
saying how he would do that and still mop up all that ``Republican
red ink in Washington.''
   Dukakis has leavened traditionally liberal stands on health
insurance, education and Social Security with a commitment to
business-like efficiency in managing the affairs of government.
   His bedrock campaign vow is to preside over an economy that
provides ``good jobs at good wages for every citizen,'' and he
cites the turnabout in the Massachusetts economy over the past
decade as evidence of his capacity to occupy the chief executive's
mansion at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
   But this efficiency-minded governor has not provided voters a
balance sheet explaining just how he proposes to fulfill these
promises while still ``mopping up the Republican red ink in
Washington.''
   He extols partnerships with the private sector, like programs he
launched in Massachusetts to build day care centers and subsidized
housing.
   Dukakis also points with pride to Massachusetts' recent
enactment of the nation's first law requiring most employers to
offer workers basic health insurance _ a program that will cost the
state $550 million through 1992.
   Dukakis, noting that most of the 37 million Americans without
health insurance are in working families, says a similar
requirement could be imposed nationally without creating a huge
federal bureaucracy or costing the Treasury ``a dime.''
   He has attached dollar signs to only a few of his campaign
pledges: a $500 million economic development fund to spur regional
growth; $250 million on a ``National Teaching Excellence Fund'' to
lure college students into the profession with scholarships; $3
billion in housing subsidies over three years for a ``National
Partnership for Affordable Housing'' to help ``end the shame, the
disgrace of homelessness in America.''
   He promises to make a first-rate education a birthright for
every child and to provide welfare mothers ``real training for real
jobs.'' His state has been a pacesetter in training programs to
provide a pathway out of welfare.
   He vows there will be no cuts or means-testing of Social
Security.
   Dukakis says of reducing the gaping federal deficits: ``There
are only four ways to do it: cut spending, increase revenue,
improve economic performance, and reduce interest rates. We must do
all four.''
   ``No serious candidate for president can rule out the
possibility of new taxes,'' he says. But he insists that before any
be considered, an attempt be made to ``collect every dime we can''
of the $110 billion that scofflaws and cheats fail to pay the
Treasury each year.
   Any new taxes ``should be based on ability to pay,'' Dukakis
says.
   He speaks often of ending Reagan administration cuts in student
aid and other social programs, but not of launching new federal
initiatives.
   He promises to ``wage a real war, not a phony war, against
drugs,'' by appointing an anti-drug czar, cutting off foreign aid
to countries that refuse to crack down on drugs, expanding drug
treatment and education programs, and giving ``the Coast Guard,
Customs Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration the support
they need.''
   He also would ``authorize our armed services, under appropriate
circumstances, to assist foreign governments'' seeking to destroy
drug crops and labs within their borders.
   He opposes such strategic weapons systems as the MX and
Midgetman missiles, as well as the B1 bomber already in limited
production. But he also vows to beef up conventional U.S. forces,
promising to ``insist on real defense for our dollars.''
   Dukakis frequently ridicules President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative, and says the nation needs ``star schools, not
Star Wars.'' But he would scale back, not eliminate, basic research
on the space defense shield to its pre-1983 level of less than $1
billion a year.
   On America's huge trade deficit, Dukakis has generally opposed
protectionist legislation, saying, ``If we're going to make America
No. 1 again, we've got to do more than wave a fist at our foreign
competitors, we've got to roll up our sleeves, go to work and beat
them.''
   On education, Dukakis promised to create tuition prepayment
plans for families who can save. ``For students who must borrow,''
he said, ``I will propose an Education Insurance Fund that, like a
`reverse social security,' will allow loan repayment through
payroll withholding.''
   He opposes the death penalty.
   He supports Medicaid funding of abortions.
   On energy, the New England governor is adamantly opposed to an
oil import tax. He would seek to repeal the windfall profits tax,
fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, encourage use of natural gas
and oppose construction of new nuclear plants until waste disposal
and other problems are resolved.
   On the Middle East, Dukakis has promised to reinvigorate the
quest for peace along the lines laid out in the Camp David Accords.
He is a strong supporter of Israel.
   Dukakis is a critic of political action committees. He has
refused to accept PAC contributions and supports lowering the limit
on how much they can give congressional candidates from $5,000 to
$1,000.

   Jesse Jackson is trying to get what he wants at
the Democratic National Convention by refusing to say just what it
is. That leaves artfully unanswered the riddle that has worried the
Democrats all year.
   Jackson described his demands in euphonic generalities that,
right up to the convention's opening day, defied any settlement
with Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee in
waiting.
   That preserved what little suspense remained in the Democratic
script. More to the Jackson point, it preserved the losing
candidate's role on the convention stage.
   Jackson's platform dissent will be played out on Tuesday. His
name will be entered in his losing cause on the roll call for
presidential nomination on Wednesday night. He said today he would
not enter it for the vice presidential nomination on Thursday and
would not encourage anyone else to do so, but it is still possible
somebody will put his name up against Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas,
Dukakis' choice and the certain nominee.
   Nonetheless, Jackson says that by the end of convention week,
the party will be united.
   Dukakis will be in control from tonight's opening gavel. When
delegates vote on a major issue, they will vote with Dukakis _
although his camp can afford to provide conciliatory leeway for
victories by the Jackson minority on some points.
   Jackson says he isn't after a job, a title or a position. ``I
seek a partnership, I seek equity, I seek shared responsibility,''
he said.
   Later, the black candidate tried a plantation analogy. ``I don't
mind working,'' he said. ``I'll go out and pick the voters. I'll go
back and bale up some votes. But when I get back to the big house I
want to help count the cotton.''
   Jackson complains that the Democrats have not defined a place
``for the progressive wing in the campaign.''
   Dukakis could, of course, reply that he is something of a
progressive _ or at least that some of his best friends are
progressives.
   Dukakis and his lieutenants have said repeatedly that they want
Jackson in the councils of the party and on the campaign for the
Democratic ticket. They've said that Jackson's campaign allies will
have a role. But they are not about to give away pieces of the
political command the Massachusetts governor won in the Democratic
presidential primaries.
   Dukakis said Sunday that Jackson is an important member of the
Democratic team, but added pointedly that he won't be calling the
plays. ``Every team has to have a quarterback,'' the Massachusetts
governor said. ``That's the nominee.''
   Jackson had a sporting reply. ``The Democratic convention is
just the all-star game, not the World Series,'' he told his
supporters. ``Don't make World Series decisions, don't just say how
well you're doing because you make a great shot in the first
quarter.''
   Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager, said a unity accord
would require ``mutual trust and respect and a feeling of comfort
which can only grow from a face-to-face meeting.'' The two met two
weeks ago in Boston, but that was before Dukakis chose Bentsen as
his vice presidential nominee, and let it be known publicly before
he told Jackson privately.
   Another adviser, Frank Watkins, said the Jackson camp wants to
be ``in the circle, in the loop, on the team.'' Once that's clear,
he said, such matters as campaign travel arrangements and staff
help for the general election will fall into place.
   He didn't quite dismiss speculation that one of the things
Jackson wants is access to a chartered campaign airplane. After
all, said Watkins, if the Dukakis people want Jackson to campaign
in California one day and New York the next, they won't expect him
to walk.
   That general election campaign role is the one that will count
for the Dukakis ticket, and for Jackson as well.
   Former President Jimmy Carter said Jackson will work for the
ticket. In Carter's view, Jackson will not risk being seen as the
cause of a Democratic rift that might lead to defeat on Nov. 8.
   Along with his demands, Jackson sends regular signals that he
will be aboard for the campaign against the Republicans.
   While he told labor delegates on Sunday that the convention
should not be a coronation, Jackson added:
   `We're not threatening to leave the convention. We're
threatening to stay.''

<HEAD>Southern Cuisine: It's Changing, But It Keeps The Down-Home Flavor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Democratic convention visitors to Atlanta want
``Southern cooking,'' they will have to look for it among
restaurants that take 28 Yellow Pages to list. But it's there and
it's worth the hunt.
   It is one of a few distinctive regional cuisines left in
America, but it is changing and it is hard to define.
   ``Southern cooking is primarily home cooking, not chef's art,''
writes Nathalie Dupree in her book ``New Southern Cooking.''
   ``Our desire to preserve, hold on to and remain set in our ways
is reflected in our politics and customs and in the soul food that
became a trademark and mainstay of Southern cooking,'' she writes.
``Much of it came from former slaves who were our cooks.''
   A few Atlanta restaurants specialize in traditional Southern
dishes. Thelma's Kitchen and Mary Mac's Tea Room are among the
better-known ones.
   But Amanda Brown Olmstead, publicist for the nationally
broadcast public television series ``New Southern Cooking with
Nathalie Dupree,'' has a different idea about the best place to
find Southern cooking in Atlanta.
   ``My advice is to make a friend and eat in,'' she said. ``That's
where you are going to find true Southern cooking the way my momma
did it and the way we still do it.''
   Visitors can expect to find lots of carbohydrates, such as grits
and biscuits, and a lot of fried food, especially chicken. ``There
is nothing more Southern than those three foods,'' she said.
   Southern regional specialties are becoming more complex. Ms.
Dupree's new book has a grits recipe that includes turnip greens,
parmesan cheese and whipped cream. Not traditional, but certainly
Southern. New approaches to traditional ingredients live
cheek-by-jowl with hush puppies and corn bread.
   The Southern ham or sausage biscuit, she said, is now a popular
fast-food item across the country.
   Southern cooking is the stuff of poems, comfort and coronaries,
nostalgia and bad _ nay, cruel _ jokes. It is improperly
generalized. The spicy Cajun offerings of south Louisiana have
little in common with the rest of the region.
   Other regional specialties, such as barbecue, are available
almost everywhere in some form or another.
   This son of the Pacific Northwest fell happily into his first
rural barbecue pit two years ago. It was ``Peanut's Redneck
Barbecue'' on a back road near Athens, Ga. Believe every word on
the sign.
   The word ``barbecue'' comes from the old French ``from the beard
to the tail,'' which is how they skewered goats for cooking back
then. In Mexico today the wildly popular ``barbacoa'' is almost
always goat and usually reserved for Sundays.
   In the South it is pork unless specified otherwise. Most rural
pits close early and don't serve alcohol. Generally, they do just
one thing and they do it very well.
   Barbecue is taken seriously, and Southerners go through it like
Sherman through Georgia, a comparison visitors would do well to
avoid.
   Atlanta has its share of good barbecue pits but the ones with
atmosphere lurk outside smaller towns, usually in tin-roofed
ramshackle buildings redolent of hickory smoke and pungent sauce,
furnished with long, common tables and benches. Ask locally.
   ``There's no real secret to barbecue,'' the genius cook at the
Fresh Air Barbecue near Jackson, Ga., told visitors recently.
``Most folks just don't take time to do it right.''
   The time to do it right, from when the fresh hams are put in the
slow-cooking smoker until they fall apart in their savory glory, is
about 24 hours.
   Barbecue often comes with Brunswick stew, which is another
Southern standby, and a piece of corn bread the size of Europe.
Sauces vary from the pointless to fiery potions it takes a whip and
a chair to tame. Try a little before you slop it on.
   Memphis claims the title of the American Mecca of barbecue.
That's probably true but don't say so at Peanut's, or at the Fresh
Air. Just don't.

<TEXT>
   A motorcyclist who led police on
a chase at up to 140 mph across six freeways took advantage of his
lead to stop for gas and a Coke before he was caught, authorities
said.
   Cary Watson, 30, who told police he was a professional
motorcycle rider, was arrested Sunday afternoon at a restaurant in
Oceanside.
   That was more than an hour after officers tried to pull him over
for nearly colliding with a police car in Huntington Beach, 80
miles away, said Sgt. Ed Deuel.
   Watson, of nearby Ontario, reached speeds up to 140 mph as he
led patrol cars and a police helicopter on the chase, Deuel said.
   ``The helicopter was called to the scene immediately because
that was the only way we could stay with the motorcyclist through
the traffic,'' he said.
   Watson evaded officers on city streets for seven minutes, then
headed north on the San Diego Freeway, the sergeant said. The chase
took police onto five other freeways.
   Watson stopped in San Juan Capistrano, where he took $2 worth of
gasoline without paying for it, Deuel said. He then rode his 1987
Honda Interceptor to the restaurant, Deuel said.
   He took off his helmet, put it on the motorcycle, went inside
and ``ordered a Coke to go,'' said Lt. George Renek, who surmised
that Watson hoped ``to mingle with the crowd and get lost in it.''
   Watson was arrested without incident and booked for
investigation of misdemeanor reckless driving, evading arrest,
petty theft and drag racing. He was free on bail, Deuel said.
   ``I think he just didn't want to get a ticket,'' Renek said.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: Jesse Jackson.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson: Let me express my thanks to Governor Dukakis and
Senator Bentsen.
   We've had a very fruitful and thorough meeting today.
   We said early on in my campaign that we had the challenge to
win. The three prerequisites were to, one, expand our party and
make room for some new people, people who had grown cynical, who
had withdrawn, who'd pushed out of the process, who felt abandoned,
but had the power to vote.
   It was our challenge to renew their faith, revive their spirits,
establish within them hope again.
   The excitement that we feel in Atlanta today is, hope has been
unleashed on our nation _ ghettoes, barrios, farmers who are
trapped in the double drought of the cutoff of support from
Washington and the lack of rain, but feel the hope that a new day
is coming, and they're holding on until the morning comes.
   And so a key has been to expand our party.
   The second key, to build a viable broad-based coalition. Where
the interests of many Democrats converge, we find common ground.
Move from a history so often a battleground _ racial or sexual or
religious or even regional battleground _ to economic and social
common ground and, on tomorrow, higher ground.
   We talked about building that coalition and then to change our
national priorities.
   We met and discussed matters of serious and significant concern,
a relationship of substance, support and candor, the commitment to
help build a team that will expand our party and carry us to
victory in November.
   The platform negotiations will resume today. No doubt there'll
be debate and deliberation on tomorrow night, but debate and
deliberation stirs the soul of our democracy. Through debate over
the soul of our party, we debate policy and priorities and
direction.
   On Wednesday night, my name will go into nomination. When that
is over, we go on to another level of our campaign because then we
will have a nominee.
   Things are fundamentally changed then. We move from the All-Star
break of American politics on to the World Series in November. We
intend to win.
   We talked about expanded roles and participation in the
Democratic National Committee at the state and national levels, and
then we talked about legislation that will make a difference, that
will be emphasized in the campaign that has great meaning: that
plant-closing legislation that Senator Bentsen has been so
identified with, his commitment to D.C. statehood to enfranchise
those residents who live in the capital of our country, or the
commitment that Congressman Conyers has to universal, on-site same
day registration, or Congressman Dellums' commitment to legislation
that will end apartheid in South Africa, or the ABC child-care
legislation, or economic set-asides for development.
   So the range of subject matter was broad, in-depth, in detail,
in my judgment, fruitful.
   We're now on a track that will lead to expanded involvement,
more excitement, and great motivation to build a team that will
carry us to victory, and will spare the people of the agony,
abandonment and neglect they felt these last seven years.
   Of all of the programs to end dope _ cutting it off at the
source, strengthening border patrols, or clinics for those who are
sick _ the most effective dope program is hope. Hope is the
alternative to dope.
   Hope must dispel our fears, our reasonable doubts, to gain for
us our sense of self-esteem. We must build a campaign of hope, in
all of our doing, keep hope alive.

   Douglas ``Wrong Way''
Corrigan, going the right way this time, returned Monday to the
airfield where he landed his small plane 50 years ago after leaving
New York on a flight to California.
   ``Look, no hands!'' the 81-year-old American declared, arms
aloft in a triumphant gesture, as the commuter plane carrying him
from Dublin landed at Baldonnel Airport. Corrigan wore the same
leather flying jacket he had on when he landed here the first time.
   An army band, a Cabinet minister and the U.S. ambassador greeted
him, along with R.W. Sullivan, the aircraft engineer who met him on
the first trip.
   He came to Ireland by commercial jet for festivities celebrating
his famous wrong-way flight, then joined the pilot in the cockpit
of a propeller plane renamed WW2 _ or Wrong Way 2 _ for the
10-minute flight to Baldonnel.
   Corrigan has always said he misread his compass, headed east by
mistake, and did not know until his $900 Curtiss-Robin monoplane
pierced the clouds 28 hours later that he was over Ireland. He had
applied to fly the Atlantic, but was refused because the plane,
carrying 330 gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil, was
deemed too heavy to be safe over the ocean.
   Before leaving the United States for his first trip to Ireland
since, the Texas-born pilot hinted his story might change, but he
stuck to it at the initial ceremony.
   ``I followed the wrong end of the compass needle,'' he told
admirers at Baldonnel Airport. ``It's a simple thing to happen. It
shouldn't have happened. I was the first one to admit that I had
made a mistake and I was willing to correct it.''
   He recalled that the the runway at Baldonnel, now Irish air
force headquarters, was a grass strip the last time he landed there.
   ``I taxied up to a little shack where there were two men in
uniform,'' Corrigan said. ``I was in trouble until they found out
what my name was and the policeman said, `He's just another
Irishman coming home.'''
   U.S. Ambassador Margaret Heckler said Monday: ``I'm so proud of
you. You are amazing.''
   Corrigan said he had never really been in Ireland before because
he had no passport or other papers the first time he arrived.
``This time I'm in Ireland and I have the papers to prove it,'' he
said.
   Also present were Transport Minister John Wilson; Alice Glenn,
deputy lord mayor of Dublin, and David Kennedy, chief executive of
the national airline Aer Lingus, who wished ``a hearty cead mile
failte _ 100,000 welcomes _ to Mr. Douglas `Wrong Way' Corrigan.''
   Wilson congratulated the sprightly American on still being able
to fit into his 1938 flying jacket and said he hoped Corrigan's
plane, now partly dismantled at his home in Santa Ana, Calif.,
might one day return to Ireland for exhibit.
   When Corrigan landed in Ireland on July 18, 1938, after a flight
that was supposed to take him to Long Beach, Calif., he had only $3
in his pocket and knew no one, he said in an interview Sunday
before departing from New York.
   This time, accompanied by his son, Harry, and daughter-in-law,
Charlotte, Corrigan crossed the Atlantic in six hours as an honored
guest of Aer Lingus in a Boeing 747. The airline plans three days
of ceremonies for him.
   U.S. aviation authorities suspended Corrigan from flying for
five days after he his unauthorized trip to Dublin, but Americans
and the Irish loved his explanation.
   The results in the United States were a New York ticker-tape
parade, a meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a movie,
``The Flying Irishman,'' starring Corrigan as himself.
   He was a woodworker and took up aviation when he helped build
the Spirit of St. Louis, in which Charles Lindbergh made the first
solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927.
   Corrigan bought his own plane for $310 in 1931 and spent $590
modifying it for the trip.

<TEXT>
   Iran's acceptance of a cease-fire in its
war with Iraq could cause major economic and political shifts in a
region that has forged eight years of policy around the Persian
Gulf war.
   An end to the war could also be an ominous development for
Israel. Both Iran and Iraq are enemies of the Jewish state, but
have been preoccupied with fighting each other.
   The brief statement released today by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency, in which Tehran said it accepted a U.N.
cease-fire resolution, raised hopes that the war would finally come
to an end.
   Iran, which has suffered a series of defeats at Iraqi hands in
recent months, may have decided finally to accept an end to the
conflict. Alternatively, it may be seeking time to rebuild its
battered war machine.
   Early reaction from Iraq was cautious.
   Iraq's information minister, Nassif Ltayyif Jassem, said Iran
accepted the resolution for tactical reasons and not out of any
desire for peace.
   ``Our previous knowledge of the devious Iranian regime makes us
be cautious and wary until peace is achieved and until we reach an
agreement between Iran and Iraq for peace,'' he was quoted by the
Iraqi News Agency as saying.
   Iraq accepted the U.N. resolution soon after it was issued last
year.
   With eight years of hostility to overcome, each side will be
highly suspicious of the other's motives _ a factor that could
delay a shift away from military spending.
   But an end to clashes on land and over the Persian Gulf would
remove a major threat to the countries that provide much of the
world's oil supplies and sit on half of its known oil reserves.
   There would be no need for the United States to maintain a
massive and costly fleet in the Persian Gulf to protect oil
shipping from war-related attacks _ and to prevent growing Soviet
influence.
   The removal of the U.S. fleet and U.S. pressure for an arms
embargo of Iran would remove a major source of friction between the
United States and a country it has long viewed as vitally
strategic. Improved relations could benefit the Americans held
hostage by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon.
   Iraq and Iran would be free to use some of their massive oil
wealth to rebuild their war-ravaged cities, ports and oil
facilities rather than buying military hardware from China, France,
the Soviet Union and elsewhere.
   An end to clashes would lessen hostility between Iran and Iraq's
main Arab backers _ Kuwait and Saudi Arabia _ which have suffered
missile strikes, attacks on ships and terrorist acts apparently
linked to their support of Iraq.
   Iran and Iraq will also be under pressure from their war-weary
populations to once again fill their ill-stocked shops with
affordable consumer goods and their pockets with the money to buy
them.
   Businessmen throughout the world who have suffered for years
with unpaid credits to Iraq and lost business opportunities in Iran
will be looking for massive rewards in the reconstruction efforts.
   Munition makers will suffer. Contractors will benefit,
especially the Japanese, French, West German and Korean companies
who have stood by the war-stricken countries through hard times.
   The effect on global oil markets is uncertain.
   But freed from Iraqi attacks on its oil shipping, Iran would be
able to increase its oil exports at least to the 2.37 million
barrels-a-day quota laid down by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries at a time of excess supply and soft prices.
   Iraq, which has no quota because of its insistance that it have
the same quota as Iran, is producing 2.7 million barrels a day and
exporting via pipelines through Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Its gulf
ports were shut down at the start of the war.
   Unlike Iran _ which has largely avoided debt _ Iraq faces
repayment of $30 billion in debts to Western governments and
private companies _ although an end to the war would probably
loosen further credits.
   ``You've got a country with over 200 billion barrels of proven
oil reserves. They plainly have a way to repay,'' a Western
diplomat in Baghdad said earlier this year.
   The end of the so-called tanker war in the gulf would slash
massive insurance premiums now charged for ships in the waterway,
making it more attractive for ships to use ports and drydocks there.
   Investors who have been fearful of putting money onto the rim of
a war zone should be attracted back to states such as Bahrain and
Dubai.
   Ports just outside the gulf, such as Fujaira and Khor Fhakkan,
would probably suffer as they lose traffic which had flocked there
to avoid the costly, hazardous journey up the gulf.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A man went on a shooting spree one
day after his family had been advised on committing him for
psychiatric treatment, killing four people and wounding five others
as they rode by in their cars, authorities said today.
   The gunman, who was shot and wounded by police, was hospitalized
today in critical condition, authorities said.
   Forsyth County Sheriff Preston Oldham said Michael Charles
Hayes, 24, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in
the Sunday night shooting, just outside Winston-Salem.
   The day before, Oldham said, deputies had been called to a
disturbance at a moped shop operated by Hayes and advised his
family on how to seek involuntary commitment for Hayes to a
pyschiatric facility.
   Oldham gave no details of the disturbance and said Hayes' family
took no action to have him committed. He said police had not
determined a motive for the spree.
   ``The guy was shooting at cars that went by,'' said O.J.
Watkins, who lives across the street from the moped shop.
   He said he heard shots fired, looked out a window of his house
and saw Hayes carrying a rifle. Watkins said he saw Hayes run in
and out of the shop several times.
   Oldham said it appeared that Hayes roamed a two-block area near
the shop, shooting people as they drove by in cars. Five cars were
struck by gunfire, but two drivers managed to drive out of the
neighborhood after they were wounded. All the victims were shot
with a small-caliber weapon, Oldham said.
   The sheriff said two county police cars were hit by bullets as
they pulled up the shop, but no deputies were wounded.
   An intersection near the shop was littered with glass shards
this morning. An officer who refused to give his name said the
gunman apparently took ``potluck,'' shooting at whatever cars came
by.
   Jason Poore, who also lives nearby, said the shooting started
near the moped shop and lasted 15 to 20 minutes.
   ``I was coming around the corner and I saw the lights on (at the
moped shop), which is unusual for a weekend,'' Poore said.
   ``I went home and didn't think nothing of it. I sat in the front
room and heard something popping that sounded like firecrackers,''
Poore said.
   Hayes and two of the wounded were taken to North Carolina
Baptist Hospital, according to public relations director Roger
Rollman.
   Oldham said the murder warrants had not been served because
Hayes was in critical condition.
   The rest of the wounded were taken to Forsyth Memorial Hospital
where two were admitted, authorities said.

   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards planned Monday to
get a pre-speech massage, paid for by her mother, to soothe away
any pre-keynote jitters.
   ``I'm terribly nervous. I'm sure I'll just be a jittering fool
by the time I'm supposed to go on,'' she said early in the day.
   As keynote speaker Monday on the opening night of the Democratic
National Convention, Ms. Richards, who wants to run for Texas
governor in 1990, had the nation's ear.
   ``The keynote, I think, is the person who just sort of opens the
door and says, `Come on in,' and that's what I hope I can do
tonight, talk about who I am, where I came from, where I think the
country has been and invite the public to join us,'' she said.
   Ever since she got the keynote assignment, Ms. Richards, a
54-year-old divorced mother of four, has said she would use it to
persuade voters that Democrats can do a lot to help families.
   ``It's not a party issue,'' she said, adding, however, that
``the past eight years of Republican administration has made it
harder on family life.''
   Family life, and its demands on women, can be the best
management training in the world, according to Ms. Richards, who as
state treasurer handles more than $150 billion worth of
transactions a year.
   ``Managing a house is probably the greatest management training
in the world. You're juggling lives. You've got to do it on time.
You've got to bring people to a consensus. You have to allow
everyone to save face. All the decisions have to be decisions that
make everyone happy. I think I bring that to my job,'' she said.
   And the white-haired former county commissioner has said the
speech should be a vehicle for the Democratic national ticket, not
her own political future.
   ``I'm not trying to go down in the history books. I'll just try
to communicate and deliver a message,'' she said.

   Innkeeper Cindy Alper must keep a close
eye on where a customer sits in the Swiss Hutte restaurant, because
part of the dining area is in Massachusetts and the rest is in New
York.
   ``There are different meals taxes in the two states,'' her
husband, Gert, said recently. ``In the Massachusetts section it's a
5 percent tax and in the New York part it's 7 percent.''
   The Alpers said they knew about the inn's dual statehood when
they bought it two years ago.
   ``The bookwork is a little more _ the liquor licenses for both
states and the different taxes _ but it hasn't been too different
from other restaurants,'' Mrs. Alper said. ``Most people who know
about it find it amusing.''
   But Mrs. Alper took exception to publicity the inn received over
the winter when she had trouble renewing her Massachusetts liquor
license.
   The license was revoked temporarily by the Egremont selectmen
when the Alpers failed to attend a public hearing to transfer the
liquor license from the inn's former owner.
   As a result, drinks could be served only in the New York side of
the restaurant. The confusion has since been resolved.
   Many of the inn's patrons are weekend travelers to the community
of 1,200 people from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New
Jersey, Mrs. Alper said, noting that the Tanglewood Music Center is
nearby in the Berkshire Mountains.
   The Alpers aren't the only ones coping with life on the edge.
   Doing business on a two-state basis is nothing new to Catamount
Ski Area president and general manager William Gilbert.
   ``My father, years ago, built a golf course half in New York and
half in Connecticut,'' Gilbert said, adding that he once took part
in a venture to construct a marina on the line between New York and
New Jersey.
   ``This hasn't been a novelty for us,'' Gilbert said. ``We were
almost destined to come to Catamount _ it's been our history.''
   But Gilbert said the ski area is not on the border.
   ``That is a misnomer. For all intents and purposes, we are two
resorts. One is in Massachusetts and one is in New York,'' Gilbert
said.
   Gilbert said he and his partner approached the ski area as two
separate ventures from the start, securing operating permits and
licenses from New York and from Massachusetts.
   ``We were realistic. You can't go to Massachusetts and say,
`Will you let New York take care of everything?' Both states regard
you as part of them and want to take care of what is theirs.''
   The resort even splits its utilities. The lights for night
skiing are on Massachusetts power lines and the lifts run on New
York electricity.
   ``If there is a power failure in Massachusetts, we can run the
lights from New York,'' Gilbert said.
   Law enforcement on the border line also can be unusual, Egremont
Police Chief Michael K. Balcom said.
   ``Prior to my coming here, the only communication Egremont had
with New York authorities was by telephone. The first thing I did
as chief was to set up radio contact with the Columbia County
sheriff's office,'' he said.
   Whatever the hardships, Gilbert and the Alpers said they would
do it all again, although Mrs. Alper said there are limits.
   ``I've heard of a restaurant further north on the New
York-Canada border. I don't know if I would want to do business
between two countries; the two states is enough.''

<HEAD>Climate Models Predict More Hot, Dry Summers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hot, dry weather in most of the nation
this summer may just be a hint of things to come.
   Researchers using five computer-simulated climate models
forecast that summers in the United States generally will be drier
over the next 10 years, although the models differ on how
widespread the dry spell will be.
   Climate observers disagree about the relationship between
drought and the greenhouse effect, in which carbon dioxide, methane
and other gases accumulating in the air trap energy from the sun
and raise the Earth's temperature. But most express concern about
increases in these gases.
   To study the problem, William W. Kellogg of the National Center
for Atmospheric Research in Bolder, Colo., and Zong-ci Zhao of
Peking University used five different climate models to calculate
the effect on soil moisture. Their findings were reported in the
current edition of the Journal of Climate.
   Climate models are complex computerized simulations of the
workings of the Earth's climate and weather. While they attempt to
duplicate the same processes, the versions developed by different
scientists vary.
   Kellogg and Zhao took the five most respected models, doubled
the calculation for the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
and then ran the computers through several yearly cycles to see
what would happen to the weather.
   Three of the models predicted drier summers over the majority of
the North American continent. The other two also called for large
dry areas, although not as extensive as the first three. There was
some indication of increased winter wetness, however, at least in
Canada.
   The researchers found that the regions closer to the poles
warmed more than the equatorial regions as a result of the
greenhouse effect. That reduced the temperature difference between
the poles and equator, which reduces the planet's large-scale
circulation and rainfall patterns.
   Here is a rundown of the effect on soil moisture according to
the calculations in the five different climate models run by
Kellogg and Zhao:
   _National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Model: Summer, dry over all of the United
States. Winter, dry over the United States south of a line running
generally from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina west to Northern
California.
   _United Kingdom Meteorological Office Model: Summer, dry over
all of the United States except for portions of Southern
California, Arizona and New Mexico. Very dry in the Great Plains
and Southeast. Winter, dry over the United States east of the
Rockies. Moist over Southern California and Nevada.
   _Oregon State University Model: Summer, dry over all of the
United States except a portion of Southern California and a region
including Arkansas, Mississippi and the Gulf Coast from New Orleans
to the Florida Panhandle. Winter, dry over all of the United States
except for the northern Plains states from Wisconsin west through
eastern Washington and Oregon.
   _National Center for Atmospheric Research Model: Summer, dry in
the Southeastern and Gulf Coast states, the Southwest, Southern
California, and the Midwest from the Great Lakes south and west.
Winter, dry in the Southeast, Gulf Coast, Texas, Southern
California and part of Arizona.
   _National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Goddard
Institute for Space Studies Model: Summer, dry in New England, the
Middle Atlantic and eastern Great Lakes states plus Texas and parts
of the Southwest. Winter: dry south and east of a line extending
from the St. Lawrence River through Detroit and Chicago
southwesterly through the northwest corner of Mexico.
   Temperatures recently have been the highest since record keeping
began, Daniel L. Albritton told a joint hearing of House committees
concerned with agriculture and weather problems.
   However, Albritton noted that the weather is subject to large,
periodic changes, and recent hot weather may just be a part of that
cycle.

<DATELINE>PELOPI, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beneath a leafy plane tree at a cafe where
politics is a hot topic, the betting is that ``Michalis'' will
squeeze out a narrow victory in November.
   ``Michalis'' is how Michael Dukakis is known to the 640 people
who live in Pelopi, the Greek village that bills itself as his
hometown, even though he was born in the United States.
   ``We don't want to shout about it, but the gut feeling here is
that Michalis will make it,'' said Costas Stefanou, the 42-year-old
president of the mountain village.
   Even though Dukakis has made only one visit here, in 1976 during
his first term as Massachusetts governor, he has been honored by
officials of the village on the island of Mytilene.
   In June, the six-member local council put up a sign outside town
that says in Greek and English: ``Welcome to the Hometown of
Michael Dukakis.''
   They also changed the name of the main street _ a cement strip
where dogs snooze and chickens wander _ from Athanassios Diakou to
Michael Dukakis Street.
   ``We decided that whether Michalis gets elected or not, he's
rewriting the history of our village so he should be remembered,''
Stefanou said.
   The villagers, mostly sheep- and goat-breeders whose annual
income averages around $1,500, say they'd like to charter a couple
of jumbo jets to take everyone to Washington if Dukakis wins.
   ``We should be there for the inauguration. Michalis may have
been born in America, but he's from Pelopi and he's one of us,''
said Giorgos Hatzimichalakis.
   They also intend to offer Dukakis a plot of land on the mountain
``to build a house where he can think and write, or do some
gardening'' Hatzimichalakis said.
   Islanders on Mytilene, also known by its ancient name of Lesbos,
are proud of a creative tradition that started with Sappho, the 6th
century B.C. poet who wrote of love between women. Odysseus Elytis,
whose poetry won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1978, also comes
from Mytilene.
   The village of gray stone houses has a spectacular view across a
narrow strait to the coast of Turkey. Windy and bleak in winter, it
provides a cool refuge in summer from the fierce Mediterranean heat.
   ``Michalis came here for a few hours on a summer afternoon. He
spoke good enough Greek, and we sat under the plane tree and
chatted. He seemed a plain, straightforward sort of man,'' Stefanou
said.
   ``I remember he liked watermelon. He ate his portion and wasn't
shy about asking for more,'' he added.
   Dukakis' grandparents _ Stylianos and Olympia _ were born in
Pelopi in the 1860s when the island was under Ottoman Turkish rule.
The village was known then as Yelia, the Greek word for laughter or
ridicule.
   It was renamed in the 1940s after Pelops, the mythological ruler
of southern Greece, at a time when many Greek villages adopted
classical names. The villagers say Pelopi ``sounds a bit more
dignified'' than Yelia.
   Like other islanders seeking a better life, Stylianos Dukakis
moved to Turkey as a young man to open a grocery store in the town
of Edremit, where Panos Dukakis, the governor's father, was born in
1896.
   ``The Dukakis family had what what we call `anisychia,' a kind
of restlessness that drives you to get ahead,'' said Yiannis
Manolis, whose father bought the ruined Dukakis family home in
Pelopi in 1933.
   Nailed to the rebuilt courtyard wall a neatly lettered sign says
in English: ``This here is the house of the Dukakis family.''
   There is no such sign on the former Dukakis home across the
strait in Edremit, a prosperous town of 30,000 people set in a
coastal plain covered with olive trees. Only a few residents know
the house, a two-story building with a vine growing above the door
on a narrow street lined with artisan workshops.
   ``My father was given this house when the populations were
moved. He never knew who lived there before, and I never heard of
Michael Dukakis until this year,'' said Mahide Tassi, 50, who lives
there with her daughter.
   More than 4 million Greeks and Turks were involved in population
exchanges that followed a failed Greek invasion of Turkey in 1921.
   ``We thought the house had been a wine store, my father used to
tell how he found a big vat of wine when he moved in,'' she said.
   There are no records that list property ownership in Edremit
before World War I, a period when Greeks owned many of the town's
stores and controlled much of the trade along the Turkish Aegean
coast.
   ``When I heard the presidential candidate's family had lived
here, I checked the records but they don't go back so far,'' said
Hayrullah Yildiz, subgovernor for the Edremit district.
   The Dukakis family kept their links with Pelopi by spending two
months there every summer, according to villagers.
   The governor's father lived with relatives in Mytilene town for
a few months before sailing for the United States in 1912 to join
his three brothers there. His parents and sister followed the
following year.
   By contrast with Pelopi, there is no hometown backing for
Dukakis in Edremit, according to Yildiz.
   ``I don't think there's any special interest in Dukakis here.
We're always happy with whoever gets elected, whether it's Ronald
Reagan or Michael Dukakis or even Kirk Douglas,'' he said.
   But the family that lives in the former Dukakis home would like
the presidential candidate to visit.
   ``Win or lose, I'd like to entertain him here,'' said Mrs.
Tassi, gesturing around her brightly painted living room decorated
in traditional Turkish style with benches covered with red cushions
and weavings.

<TEXT>
   Bentsen: Thank you very much. Governor Dukakis, Reverend
Jackson. There has been a reaching out on both sides in bringing
these forces together. This truly is a politics of inclusion.
   There are those who would like to take the approach _ or perhaps
the Saint Ignatius view of politics _ that what you want is purity
of ideology. And if you find that and work toward that to the
ultimate, finally you have a party of one, and you sure don't win
any elections.
   But what you have seen here is a politics of inclusion, of
bringing people together, and people who share a common view on
things that are important to this country of ours _ jobs, health
care. Understanding as we have done in the welfare bill _ you have
a young, single mother on welfare, out of a job, offering her the
education, the day care for that child, so that she can work
herself out of poverty, and into a productive role in our society
as she wants. And to work for the ultimate civil right in our
country, and that's equality of opportunity.
   That's what we'll be striving for.
   Education, where we look at a report today of a child born
today, 19 years from now spending $60,000 for a college education
in a public college. And with this administration, a cutting back
in student loans.
   Looking at housing, and the question of affordability there.
Those are the things that bring us together.
   I say to you that I cannot remember any time since 1964 when
this party has been more united and brought together to victory,
and I'm convinced with that.
   We're going to face a tough fight in November of 1988. But with
this kind of unity, and the motivational work of Reverend Jesse
Jackson and the leadership of Michael Dukakis, who took a state
like Massachusetts and its economy and turned it around and did it
with effective management.
   A man who his peers have chosen as the most effective governor
of all the governors in the 50 states. With this kind of cohesion
and unity, I'm convinced we're going to win a great victory in
November.
   Thank you.

<HEAD>Reagan Group Files Campaign Charges Against Wright As Convention
Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative political action committee
lodged a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Monday
which charged House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas with violating
campaign laws, in part by selling thousands of copies of his book
to wealthy supporters.
   The complaint, by Citizens for Reagan, was filed as Wright
prepared to open the first session of the 1988 Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. Wright denounced the complaint as groundless
and a blatant political attack.
   Peter T. Flaherty, the group's chairman, made clear his intent
was to embarrass Democrats during the week Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis receives the party's presidential nomination.
   ``If the Democrats want to have someone as corrupt as Wright
chairing their convention, that's their business,'' Flaherty said
in a statement.
   ``But Wright cannot hide from his troubles while he's up on that
platform,'' Flaherty said. ``The public is entitled to a thorough
investigation of these charges and we want to make sure it takes
place.''
   In Atlanta, Wright said ``Obviously, there are people in the
Republican ranks who are trying their fevered and frantic best ...
to spread mud and slime wherever they can.''
   ``I have always deplored that type of negative politics. I think
it degrades the political process,'' Wright said. He said he
believed the public would ignore the charges and ``see through''
the gesture.
   The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, known as
the ethics committee, began its own investigation of Wright's
activities earlier this summer.
   The Citizens For Reagan complaint centers largely on the sale of
Wright's 117-page book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' at $5.95
each.
   It alleges that the $54,642 Wright received from royalties on
the sale of the book actually were concealed campaign contributions
by supporters seeking to avoid the $1,000-per-person contribution
limit set by law.
   The complaint also alleges that book sales may have been used by
Wright to evade the legal ban on officeholders receiving payment of
more than $2,000 for a single speech.
   It alleges the New England Life Insurance Co. paid $2,000 for
copies of the books instead of paying Wright directly for his
speech.
   The complaint says that this ``suggests'' that book sales may
have been used to circumvent the law limiting payments for speeches.
   In a final count, the Citizens For Reagan complaint also accuses
Rep. Tony Coehlo, D-Calif., the House majority whip, of campaign
law violations in holding fund-raisers on a yacht with expenses
picked up by a Texas savings and loan institution.
   Coelho could not immediately be reached for comment.
   The complaint acknowledges that Coehlo's campaign committee and
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee paid Vernon Savings
and Loan of Vernon, Texas $25,184 to reimburse its expenses for the
fund-raisers.
   But it states that they did so ``only after the violation was
revealed.''

   Angry protesters hurling eggs
disrupted the trial Monday of former President Chun Doo-hwan's
younger brother, who is charged with embezzling millions of dollars.
   About 50 radical students and dissidents yelling ``Execute
Chun!'' hurled eggs, potatoes and other objects outside the
courthouse on the first day of hearings in the corruption trial of
Chun Kyung-hwan.
   Judges suspended the trial until Aug. 8 as disturbances
continued inside the crowded courtroom. Hundreds of police stood
guard outside, but there were no clashes.
   The protesters also accused President Roh Tae-woo of protecting
Chun's family and called for the immediate arrest of the former
president for corruption.
   Prosecutors had been questioning the younger Chun, 46, about
allegations he amassed a fortune as head of the semi-official
Saemaul Undong (New Community) development group, which operated
under his brother's government.
   Chun was arrested March 31 and accused of peddling influence and
embezzling about $10 million by diverting the company's funds into
private investments.
   If convicted, Chun could face a prison sentence or the maximum
death penalty.
   Also on trial were 12 other people, including Saemaul officials
and the younger Chun's two brothers-in-law, who were indicted on
embezzlement, bribery and other charges.
   Chun and most of the other defendants denied they embezzled the
money, claiming the money was spent for Saemaul development
projects.
   But some of Chun's aides acknowledged the government charges and
said Chun sanctioned embezzlement and tax evasion.
   When asked about allegations that embezzled money was sent
abroad, Chun said he purchased only a $198,000 house in New Jersey
with money borrowed from a U.S. bank and his friends.
   Former president Chun's family has been the target of public
criticism for alleged corruption since he left office in February
after a seven-year term. The opposition has demanded parliamentary
questioning about wrongdoings in his government.
   On Monday, three opposition party leaders, including Kim
Dae-jung, issued a joint statement charging President Roh Tae-woo
with trying to protect the former president.
   ``We demand president Roh take a clear attitude as liquidator of
wrongdoings under the former administration,'' the statement said.
   The opposition has unsuccessfully sponsored two bills aimed at
forcing the former president to testify in the National Assembly on
corruption charges.

<TEXT>
   Democratic U.S. Rep. Samuel Stratton, who
has been reported as being under scrutiny in an investigation of
alleged fraud in Pentagon procurement, has decided not to seek a
16th term in office, sources said today.
   Stratton, a liberal, is the dean of New York's congressional
delegation and a 30-year veteran of the House of Representatives.
   Stratton, 69, was to announce his decision at a news conference
here this afternoon, the sources said. Aides in Stratton's
Washington office refused to confirm or deny the congressman's
decision.
   Stratton has been rumored to be in poor health, and the sources
said they didn't believe his decision was related to the
investigation into allegedly improper purchasing practices by the
U.S. Defense Department.
   He has not been charged or officially linked to any wrongdoing
andwas reportedly not himself a target of the probe.
   Stratton, the fourth-ranking Democrat on the House Armed
Services Committee, also heads the subcommittee on procurement and
military and nuclear systems.
   Stratton, who hasn't been been seriously challeged for the
Albany-area seat in years, had already filed enough signatures to
qualify for the November ballot. A committee of Democratic Party
officials was expected to name a new candidate Friday.
   Last Thursday was the final day that nominating petitions could
be filed for the Democratic line on the ballot. By announcing his
decision today, Stratton prevented another Democrat from
challenging the committee's choice.
   The most likely candidate for Stratton's 23rd Congressional
District seat was said to be Democratic state Assemblyman Michael
McNulty, sources said.
   The Republican candidate for the seat is Peter Bakal.
   A study by the Washington-based Common Cause found last month
that Stratton ranked No. 2 among Armed Services committee members
in the amount of speaking fees received last year from defense
contractors.
   Common Cause said Stratton's $20,000 in speaking fees from those
companies accounted for 80 percent of his total honoraria.

   A motorist was accused of running over and
killing a woman who tried to take his license plate number after
his car hit the pickup truck in which she was riding, police said.
   Leo Banning, 29, of Springfield, Ill., was held without bond
Monday after being booked with murder in the death of Roselyn
Kreger Folse, 46, and with attempted murder of the truck's
60-year-old driver, said police spokesman John Bryson.
   The driver of the truck told police she got out to talk with
Banning after he ran a stop sign and hit her truck Sunday in the
French Quarter, Bryson said.
   Ms. Folse, who was a passenger, went to the back of the car to
get the license number, Bryson said. Banning allegedly backed the
car over Ms. Folse, shifted gears and ran over her again, the
spokesman said.
   Banning then allegedly swerved onto the sidewalk toward the
older woman, who dodged, Bryson said.
   A taxi driver who saw the incident followed Banning to a bar,
asked his dispatcher to alert police and pointed the man out when
they arrived.

   Republican strategists gloated about the
attention being focused on Jesse Jackson and took potshots at Lloyd
Bentsen's finances Monday as they fought for some of the limelight
surrounding the Democratic convention.
   Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell said Democrats were on the verge
of a ``massive violation'' of campaign spending laws, while former
White House political strategist Ed Rollins said Jackson is getting
the lion's share of attention at a time when certain nominee
Michael Dukakis should be the focus.
   ``The Democrats have a rough hurdle to get through this week,''
Rollins said. ``He's been able to get through the primary process
without falling into the usual traps. Unfortunately, this week the
eyes of the world are going to focus on Mike Dukakis. For the first
time, he's got to decide who he is.''
   His comments came as a Republican ``truth squad'' met with
reporters in a downtown hotel, and were punctuated by the chants of
``Run Jesse Run'' coming for a mass rally just outside.
   ``This is the sound of peace breaking out next door,'' said Rich
Galen, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee, which is sponsoring the attacks.
   The Republicans picked two sore spots for Democrats by deciding
to focus on Bentsen's finances and the Dukakis-Jackson difficulties.
   Though Jackson and Dukakis met on Monday, Rollins said there are
still big questions remaining for voters who are paying attention
to the Democrats this week.
   Referring to Dukakis, Rollins noted: ``He's said he's going to
be the quarterback and you can only have one quarterback on the
team. Far more important is who is going to be the coach.
   ``Is Jesse Jackson going to call the shots?'' Rollins said. If
he is, there are a lot of Americans who aren't going to vote for
this ticket.''
   On the finance issue, Bentsen has been criticized for a $10,000
``chairman's club'' he formed, soliciting memberships from
lobbyists. That was disbanded after news accounts, and Bentsen said
he had made a mistake.
   But the Republican on Monday chose to focus on Bentsen's $6
million war chest for his Senate campaign in Texas.
   Under Texas law, Bentsen is able to run simultaneously for both
the Senate and vice president. McConnell said he should put the $6
million into an escrow account because spending that money in Texas
on behalf of his Senate campaign would be indistinguishable from
spending it on behalf of the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   The issue is particularly crucial, McConnell said, because Texas
is a swing state. He said that allowing Bentsen to spend the money
would in essence allow Democrats to violate the $46 million
spending limit in presidential campaigns.
   ``Bentsen's double-barreled campaign gives the Democrats an
exclusive pipeline for unlimited contributions to the Dukakis
effort in Texas under a system where private money is totally
prohibited,'' McConnell said.
   Galen rejected suggestions that the Republicans were engaging in
a negative attack.
   ``We have done this previously on a much smaller scale,'' said
Galen. ``It's not an effort to be negative, it's an effort to be
comparative.''
   And Rollins said he anticipates the Democrats will take similar
steps at next month's Republican National Convention in New Orleans.
   ``They're more than welcome to come,'' said Rollins.

<HEAD>Momentum for Energy Efficiency Has Stopped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of steady efficiency gains
motivated by the oil shocks of the 1970s, the momentum for
downsized cars, thicker insulation and other energy-saving
developments appears to have run out.
   In fact, government experts see a 1988 reversal in the economy's
declining energy consumption.
   The Energy Department's semiautonomous Energy Information
Administration recently revised upward its estimate of British
thermal units used per dollar of gross national product last year.
The estimate went from 19,900 to 20,000 Btu, the same as in 1986,
said information administration economist Jerry Lagace.
   The estimate for the first three months of 1988 is for an
increase ``so large I don't believe it,'' Lagace said, although he
added, ``This will probably be revised downward.''
   The United States began becoming more energy efficient in the
mid-1970s, after a 1973 oil embargo by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries showed how dependent Americans were
on imported oil. Gasoline prices rose steeply after the first
embargo and again after a second oil embargo in 1979.
   As a result of the oil shocks, U.S. energy useage declined an
average of 2.5 percent each year after 1976.
   Although there are numerous explanations for the reversal in
energy efficiency, the simplest is the low oil prices of recent
months.
   Last year's 94.8 cent average price in the United States for a
gallon of unleaded regular gasoline was the lowest ever, after
factoring out inflation.
   Another possible explanation for the reversal of energy
efficiency is the turnaround in U.S. industrial production.
According to estimates by the International Energy Agency in Paris,
about half of the past gains in U.S. industrial energy efficiency
came from the decline of heavy industry in the economy.
   But as the operating rates at American factories, mines and
utilities rise, many companies are restarting older, less-efficient
equipment or delaying retirement of the equipment. In addition, the
recent revival in American exports has been paced by many products
that take lots of energy to produce, such as construction equipment.
   Adding to the turnaround in energy use are homeowners who have
been wary of making long-term energy-efficiency investments.
   Several studies have shown that homeowners, offered low-cost
deals and interest-free loans by utilities, turn up their noses if
the payoff will take more than six months.
   The same is true of many businesses, said Mark Ross, University
of Michigan physicist studying energy problems. Ross said that he
finds on his visits to factories that ``people are not struggling
with how the process might be improved. They are worried about
labor relations, product quality, all the regulations that they
must comply with. Management and engineering staffs are stretched
to the limit.''
   ``Energy is very cheap here,'' said Art Rosenfeld, director of
the Center for Building Science at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory at Berkeley, Calif., who has worked with Ross.
   ``When you and I were growing up, they flared natural gas, and
we built a lot of uninsulated houses because it was cheaper to burn
more gas than to add insulation.''
   Attitudes change slowly, so ``we haven't paid attention to
investments that take five, six or seven years to pay back, like
the Germans and the Japanese do,'' Rosenfeld said.
   Today, the average U.S. new car must get 26 miles per gallon and
all cars average 18.9 mpg, 42 per cent better than in 1973.
However, the average car in Italy, where gas is four times the U.S.
price, gets 30 mpg. In Japan, the average is 31 mpg.
   In the overall economy, counting cars, buildings, factories and
everything else, the United States still uses more energy per
dollar than any other country but Canada, according to the Energy
Information Administration mesurements.
   The United States was 24 percent below Canada, but 97 percent
above West Germany and 110 percent above Japan.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen declared today that Democrats
had ``put it all together'' with Jesse Jackson's promise to
campaign for the ticket.
   Bentsen, Michael Dukakis' choice for running mate, joined the
Massachusetts governor and Jackson at a news conference where the
three men spoke of new unity reached in meetings behind closed
doors.
   ``There has been a reaching out on both sides,'' said the Texas
senator.
   Bentsen said the Democrats face a tough fight in November.
   ``But with this kind of unity and the motivational work of Jesse
Jackson and the leadership of Michael Dukakis ... I'm convinced
we're going to win a great victory in November,'' he said.
   Bentsen was visiting state delegations today to woo delegates
who do not yet support his addition to the ticket.
   At a New Jersey delegation meeting, he was greeted with applause
as well as some Jackson placards. Afterward, he received a warm
welcome from the Ohio delegation _ even though many Ohioans wanted
their senator, John Glenn, as the vice presidential candidate.
   ``I just left a meeting with Gov. Dukakis and Jesse Jackson and
we have put it all together,'' Bentsen told the cheering crowd.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste said Bentsen was needed to ``put a
little more shoulder to the wheel in Texas,'' while the Democrats
would still win Ohio.
   Glenn, celebrating his 67th birthday today, said, ``It's going
to be a great day when this tall-in-the-saddle Texan right here
becomes the vice president of the United States.''
   The Texas senator and the Massachusetts governor swept into town
Sunday for their party's national convention and declared their
partnership one of mutual admiration.
   Making their first joint appearance in the convention city at a
party hosted by Cable News Network, the two men traded accolades.
Dukakis called Bentsen ``a man whom I have admired and respected
for some time.''
   Bentsen, who has been candid about differences he has with some
of Dukakis' views, beamed and applauded. For his part, Bentsen said
Dukakis ``speaks a language we understand in the South'' _ jobs and
education.''
   Bentsen said he did not believe any ``talk about the electoral
vote lock the Republicans have on the South ... We're going to win
Georgia and Texas and state after state across this country.''
   Bentsen was greeted at the event by former President Jimmy
Carter and Georgia's two Democratic senators, Wyche Fowler and Sam
Nunn.
   Nunn predicted unity among the Democrats that would pay off in
November with a victory.
   But a more immediate task for Dukakis and Bentsen is to resolve
differences among the delegates. Some liberals see Bentsen as too
conservative while some of Jackson's supporters are angry that the
veteran civil rights activist was not picked for the No. 2 spot.
   In the New Jersey delegation, for example, Assemblyman Alan
Karcher said he was ``not happy with Bentsen.'' He added: ``We want
to know about his positions.''
   Bentsen on Sunday suggested his position on the ticket had
already helped Dukakis, apparently referring to a Houston
Chronicle-Dallas Morning News poll showing the Democratic ticket
had pulled even with the Republicans in Texas.
   Another poll, in the Chicago Tribune, indicated that the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket led Bush in California, New York and
Illinois _ accounting for 107 of the 270 electoral votes needed to
win the White House. The survey showed the Democrats running even
or slightly ahead in Bentsen's home state and behind in Florida.

   The new revolutionary Islamic government of Iran makes
statements indicating it intends to export its revolution and
topple the secular Baath Party regime in Iraq.
   Sept. 7 _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein abrogates his 1975
treaty with the Shah of Iran, claiming full sovereignty over the
Shatt al-Arab waterway, which forms the southern border between the

invades Iran. By the end of October the Iraqis occupy a strip of
Iranian territory 375 miles long and varying in width from six
miles in the north to 25 miles in the south.
   Oil centers on both sides of the border are bombarded. Iran's
vast refinery at Abadan, the largest in the world, is largely
destroyed, as is Iraq's petrochemical complex at Basra, opposite
Abadan on the other side of the Shatt.

   President Reagan's spokesman said
today the United States welcomes Iran's willingness to accept a
United Nations ceasefire resolution aimed at ending the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   But at the same time spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``I think
we have to be cautious'' because U.S. officials are unsure of the
precise conditions of Iran's agreement to U.N. Resolution 598.
   ``We don't know what their intentions are,'' he said.
   Fitzwater also refused to say to what extent Iran's move would
lead to a lowering of the American military profile in the Persian
Gulf, although he did say the United States has been prepared to
terminate tanker escort operations if peace came to the region.
   ``The United States welcomes Iran's formal acceptance of U.N.
Resolution 598, as well as (Iraq) President Saddam Hussein's,''
Fitzwater told reporters at a briefing in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
where Reagan is vacationing this week.
   ``This major breakthrough is an important first step'' Fitzwater
said. ``It opens the way for an end to the 8-year-old tragic war.''
   ``As Vice President (George) Bush told the United Nations (last
Thursday), we have long sought a just, negotiated settlement.''
   Fitzwater pledged that the U.S. government ``will continue to do
all it can'' to help build ``a durable peace with Iran and Iraq.''
   But the spokesman said that ``it is very difficult to determine
all of the motives that might be behind this move'' by Iran's
revolutionary government.
   ``One has to believe, however, that the recent losses that Iran
has suffered at the hands of Iraq'' played a major role, he said.
   Fitzwater said the downing of an Iranian passenger jet by a U.S.
Navy cruiser ``may have been a factor.'' U.S. officials say the jet
was misidentified and was shot down accidentally.
   ``We will just have to wait and see how they (the Iranians)
intend to pursue with implemenation'' of the ceasefire resolution,
which calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, withdrawal
by the belligerents to pre-war boundaries and the repatriation of
prisoners of war.
   ``As a first step, Iran and Iraq must observe an immediate
ceasefire,'' Fitzwater said. He said the United States is ``willing
to be a party'' to any system that ensures a successful
peace-building effort. ``The U.N. has the lead here.''
   Fitzwater noted that the United States has had a military
presence in the gulf region for some 40 years, and said there would
be no end to that presence.
   But, he said, ``we have always said that as hostilities end, we
will be willing to consider withdrawal'' of the ship-escort
operation.

<TEXT>
   The following are excerpts of Security Council
Resolution 598 of July 20, 1987:
   The Security Council ...
   1. Demands that, as a first step toward a negotiated settlement,
the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq observe an immediate
cease-fire, discontinue all military actions on land, at sea, and
in the air, and withdraw all forces to the internationally
recognized boundaries without delay.
   2. Requests the secretary-general to dispatch a team of United
Nations observers to verify, confirm, and supervise the cease-fire
and withdrawal and further requests the secretary-general to make
the necessary arrangements in consultation with the parties and to
submit a report thereon to the Security Council.
   3. Urges that prisoners of war be released and repatriated
without delay after the cessation of active hostilities in
accordance with the Third Geneva Convention of Aug. 12, 1949.
   4. Calls upon Iran and Iraq to cooperate with the
secretary-general in implementing this resolution and in mediation
efforts to achieve a comprehensive, just and honorable settlement,
acceptable to both sides, of all outstanding issues, in accordance
with the principles contained in the charter of the United Nations.
   5. Calls upon all other states to exercise the utmost restraint
and to refrain from any act which may lead to further escalation
and widening of the conflict and thus to facilitate the
implementation of the present resolution.
   6. Requests the secretary-general to explore, in consultation
with Iran and Iraq, the question of entrusting an impartial body
with inquiring into responsibility for the conflict and to report
to the council as soon as possible.
   7. Recognizes the magnitude of the damage inflicted during the
conflict and the need for reconstruction efforts, with appropriate
international assistance, once the conflict is ended and, in this
regard, requests the secretary-general to assign a team of experts
to study the question of reconstruction and to report to the
council.
   8. Further requests the secretary-general to examine, in
consultation with Iran and Iraq and with other states of the
region, measures to enhance the security and stability of the
region.
   9. Requests the secretary-general to keep the council informed
on the implementation of this resolution.
   10. Decides to meet again as necessary to consider further steps
to ensure compliance with this resolution.

   Fifty-six percent of stay-at-home mothers wish
they'd chosen a different career, but only 21 percent of working
moms would quit their jobs if given a second chance, a Parents
Magazine survey said Monday.
   ``For many women, work is seen as a way to achieve equality and
self-worth and meaning in life,'' said sociologist Jack Levin of
Northeastern University. ``It's not just the money.''
   Career women or not, both groups agreed on one thing: They still
would want their children. The survey indicated only 3 percent of
those questioned would not have kids if they could do it over again.
   In fact, 63 percent would have the same number of children, the
study published in the August issue said.
   Among married or previously married people questioned, 88
percent said they would wed again; 82 percent said they'd marry the
same person. In the singles crowd, 70 percent said they want to get
hitched, while 24 percent favored their status.
   The study was conducted in telephone interviews in January with
1,008 people 18 or older by Kane, Parsons & Associates. The margin
of error is 3 percent.

   Despite his peace-making session with Michael
Dukakis, Jesse Jackson said today he expects ``debate and
deliberation'' by the full Democratic National Convention over
platform planks that remain in dispute.
   With the Massachusetts governor and his only challenger in
accord, their lieutenants were expected to reach compromises on
many of the Jackson campaign's 13 minority positions.
   But Jackson appeared ready to fight on the convention floor
Tuesday night for his cornerstone issues: an endorsement of higher
taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a five-year Pentagon freeze
and full-funding of Head Start, pre-natal and nutrition programs
for mothers and infants.
   Dukakis said before the meeting that he was confident the
Democrats would produce ``a good, solid platform'' despite
continued disagreement between his forces and the Jackson campaign
on certain planks.
   Jackson made a similar point in their joint appearance after
their private talks.
   ``The platform negotiations will resume today. No doubt there
will be debate and deliberation on tomorrow night, but debate and
deliberation stirs the soul of our democracy,'' Jackson said.
``Through debate over the soul of our party, we debate policy and
priorities and direction.''
   ``There will be some reasonable disagreement I suspect on
certain platform planks, but the platform process itself has been
remarkably peaceful and harmonious,'' Dukakis said on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America.''
   He predicted that the Democrats will come ``out of this
convention in very strong shape,'' with ``a good, solid platform.''
   On the eve of the convention, Jackson said Sunday that it is up
to the delegates to decide whether his minority positions on taxes
and defense are actually majority positions.
   The Democratic Party faced the possibility of a lengthy debate
Tuesday on some of the 13 minority reports filed by the Jackson
campaign. However, most were expected to be dropped if Jackson and
Dukakis settle their larger differences.
   Until then, party spokesman Mike McCurry said, the platform ``is
in the twilight zone.''
   Party Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. told reporters today that he
likes the streamlined platform as presently written. It's ``a good
strong platform that could help the Democrats win,'' Kirk said.
   The majority report is under 4,500 words, and even with all of
Jackson's amendments it would still be the party's shortest
platform in five decades.
   The Platform Committee chairman, Michigan Gov. James J.
Blanchard, was hosting a luncheon today for the 186-member panel to
celebrate its compliance with Kirk's instructions to produce a
short document.
   Rosemary Freeman, executive director of the Platform Committee,
said it would take at least 30 minutes to debate and conduct a roll
call on each disputed minority plank. Party rules allow 10 minutes
for each side to speak before the roll is called.
   The Dukakis campaign has said repeatedly it will not accept
Jackson's call for higher taxes, a Pentagon freeze, a policy of
no-first-use of nuclear weapons, and support of self-determination
for the Palestinians.
   Some Jackson minority planks cover less thorny domestic issues
that lend themselves more readily to compromise. These included
Jackson's call for full funding of Head Start, pre-natal care and
the Women, Infants and Children program, doubling the education
budget, and creation of a national health program.
   Delegates from the National Education Association, which boasts
one of the largest labor contingents at the convention, voted at a
caucus Sunday to support the Jackson education plank. More than
half the 291 teacher delegates are Dukakis supporters.

   Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan were believed
to be on their honeymoon Monday, but details were kept under wraps.
   In a statement issued Monday in Los Angeles, Fox's publicist,
Nanci Ryder, said only that the two would return to Los Angeles
shortly.
   Fox, the star of NBC's ``Family Ties,'' and Miss Pollan were wed
Saturday at an inn in Arlington, Vt. Miss Pollan had played his
former girlfriend on the television show.
   Although the location of their wedding hadn't been disclosed,
reporters and photographers swarmed around the inn and news
helicopters hovered overhead.
   ``To our friends, fans and well-wishers, we are happy to say
that our ceremony was warm, happy and intimate and your good
feelings are deeply appreciated,'' the couple said in a statement.
   ``We would also like to say that while the helicopters above and
the media presence outside the area of the inn were not an
inconvenience to us, we know that they were to the neighboring
communities of Arlington and Manchester, Vt., and for that we are
truly apologetic.''
   Miss Pollan, 27, and Fox, 26, also co-starred in the film
``Bright Lights, Big City.'' The actor, who plays Alex Keaton on
``Family Ties,'' rocketed to fame when he starred in the film
``Back to the Future,'' the top-grossing film of 1985.

   The rap-style singing group Run-D.M.C.
earned kudos from two Missouri cities for encouraging young people
to find jobs, stay in school and stay away from drugs.
   Kansas City Mayor Richard L. Berkley and Independence Mayor
Barbara Potts presented Run-D.M.C. the keys to their respective
cities before the group performed Sunday.
   The group is supporting the ``Work Works'' campaign sponsored by
the National Alliance of Business and the National Association of
Broadcasters. To recruit young people, job programs set up booths
at concerts.
   Darryl ``D.M.C.'' McDaniels said that after 19 stops on the
group's 70-city tour, 1,200 young people have found full-time jobs
and 7,700 have enrolled in job-training programs.
   ``Since Run-D.M.C. has so much pull with the kids, we set up a
booth outside the show,'' he said. ``The kids see that we are
really serious.''

   Veteran comedian Red Skelton collapsed during a
benefit performance, but returned to finish the show and was
greeted by a round of ``Happy Birthday'' from the audience.
   Skelton celebrated his 75th birthday Monday.
   Skelton, overcome by heat and humidity, collapsed into the arms
of the sound crew as he left the stage 90 minutes into his two-hour
outdoor performance Sunday night, said Lynn Cook, executive
director of the March of Dimes Chapter of the Pacific.
   ``I'm really not feeling well. I'm going to have to leave you.
I'm very sorry,'' Skelton told the audience, according to Mrs. Cook.
   Comedian Milton Berle, who turned 80 last week, came up from the
audience to take the microphone as his wife, Ruth, and Skelton's
wife, Lothian, rushed backstage, Mrs. Cook said.
   An ambulance crew administered oxygen, and Skelton returned to
the stage and finished the show.
   Doctors later determined Skelton had been overcome by heat,
dehydration and exhaustion, Mrs. Cook said.

   Iran said today that it will accept a
U.N. resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in its nearly
8-year-old war with Iraq, which has claimed an estimated 1 million
lives.
   However, Iran also said it will not withdraw its troops from its
borders and called on Iranians to prepare to thwart further Iraqi
attacks.
   The announcement came one day after President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq cited his country's recent string of battlefield victories and
urged Iran to accept an ``honorable'' peace. Iraq, which has
already accepted the year-old U.N. resolution, said today it
remained skeptical about Iran's intentions.
   President Reagan's spokesman welcomed the move but said the
United States must remain cautious.
   In a message to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
Iran said it accepts cease-fire Resolution 598 in the ``interests
of security on the basis of justice,'' the official Islamic
Republic News Agency said.
   In New York, Perez de Cuellar said he had received a letter from
President Ali Khamenei of Iran saying Tehran accepted the
cease-fire resolution. The secretary-general said Iran accepted the
resolution unconditionally.
   ``They say that they have decided to officially declare that the
republic of Iran accepts Security Council Resolution 598,'' Perez
de Cuellar said. ``It is very clear that it is an acceptance which
doesn't refer to any conditions.''
   Iran did not say when the cease-fire would go into effect.
However, the secretary-general said he would begin consultations
with Iran and Iraq as early as today to arrange a cease-fire.
   The Iranian news agency quoted a statement by the General
Command of the Iranian Armed Forces, formed recently by Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani after the speaker of the parliament was made
acting commander of Iran's armed forces.
   Iran's acceptance of the resolution appeared to reflect a
further strengthening of the position of Rafsanjani, who is
regarded as a pragmatist.
   In a speech last month, Rafsanjani referred to the possibility
of ``non-military solutions to the war.'' In an extraordinary
comment, he also suggested recently that the time had come for Iran
to emerge from the international isolation caused largely by the
Iran-Iraq war.
   Nevertheless, Rafsanjani said in an interview on Iran television
today the decision to accept the resolution was made by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's undisputed leader. The 88-year-old
Khomeini announced the decision to top Iranian leaders during a
meeting on Sunday, Rafsanjani said.
   Iraq responded skeptically to the announcement, saying Iran had
accepted the U.N. resolution out of tactical reasons and not a
desire for peace.
   ``Our previous knowledge of the devious Iranian regime makes us
be cautious and wary until peace is achieved and until we reach an
agreement between Iran and Iraq for peace,'' Iraqi Information
Minister Nassif Ltayyif Jassem said in Baghdad. Jassem, who was
quoted by the Iraqi News Agency, said his government still had not
been informed officially of the Iranian move.
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., President Reagan's spokesman said
today the United States welcomes Iran's willingness to accept the
cease-fire resolution.
   But spokesman Marlin Fitzwater added, ``I think we have to be
cautious'' because U.S. officials are unsure of the precise
conditions of Iran's agreement to U.N. Resolution 598. ``We don't
know what their intentions are,'' he said.
   Fitzwater refused to say whether Iran's move would lead to a
lowering of the U.S. military profile in the Persian Gulf, but he
said Washington has been prepared to terminate tanker escort
operations if peace came to the region.
   The United States maintains a fleet of 27 ships in and around
the Persian Gulf to protect neutral shipping from war-related
attacks.
   In a report monitored in Nicosia, the Iranian news agency said,
``Today new conditions have been created which call for adoption of
new stances in order to continue the sacred defense and protect
Islam,'' IRNA said.
   ``We once again urge the Iranian people to man the war fronts to
confront the enemies' aggressive nature and foil their criminal
acts,'' the General Command of the Armed Forces said. ``All Muslim
combatants deployed on the war fronts are prepared to respond to
any aggression and movement of the enemy.''
   IRNA said the cease-fire acceptance was part of a strategy of
defending the Islamic Revolution that toppled the government of
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979. It said the Iranian position
should not be interpreted as caving in to pressure from the United
States and Iraq.
   In the past three months, Iraq has recaptured nearly all the
territory it lost to Iran over the past six years. There has been
no official casualty toll in the war, but foreign analysts put it
at more than 1 million.
   One of the conditions for the U.N. cease-fire was that both
countries return to their borders at the time the war started in
1980. The resolution also calls for an exchange of prisoners and
determination of who was responsible for starting the war.
   Iran had demanded that Iraq be labeled the aggressor before it
accepted the resolution. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after
border skirmishes.
   In addition to its battlefield defeats, the Tehran government
has found it increasingly difficult to recruit soldiers and keep
its economy afloat.
   In April, the Iraqis began recapturing territory lost to Iran
and claim they have since seized about 133 strategic heights in the
northern region of the 730-mile long front.
   They also launched assaults in the south that recaptured the
southern Faw peninsula in April and the Shalamcheh and Majnoon
islands in May and June.
   The war prompted a heightened U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf.
   Last year, the U.S. Navy began escorting 11 Kuwaiti tankers that
had been reflagged with the Stars and Stripes. The Navy later
expanded its protection to neutral commercial vessels that
requested help after coming under attack.
   On July 3, the cruiser USS Vincennes mistook an Iranian jetliner
for a warplane and shot it down, killing all 290 people aboard.
   In May 1987, Iraqi aircraft fired missiles at USS Stark, killing
37 American serviceman. Iraq said the attack was a mistake and
apologized.
   Iran sought a Security Council emergency hearing on the airliner
attack and during debate last week, but the council has so far
refused to condemn the United States for the attack.
   During the debate, nation after nation on the 15-member council
urged Iran to accept the cease-fire resolution. Those nations
included the Soviet Union, Britain, France, China, Japan and West
Germany.
   Debate on the airliner tragedy was to resume today. The Security
Council is expected to issue a resolution or statement on the
attack.
   Iran's presence at the Security Council meeting was its first
appearance at the council, which it has boycotted since the
beginning of the Iran-Iraq.
   Hussein, in his speech Sunday, proposed that Iran and Iraq sign
a peace accord, exchange prisoners, return to their respective
borders and vow not to interfere in each other's internal affairs.
   In addition to recent territorial losses, the Iranian population
suffered a severe psychological blow in the so-called ``war of the
cities'' between Feb. 29 and April 21.
   As many as half of Tehran's 6 million population fled to the
countryside to escape the missiles that blasted a path of
destruction across the city.
   The Iranians were clearly outgunned. The Iraqis fired nearly 200
long-range missiles, believed to be upgraded Soviet Scud weapons.
The Iranians were only able to fire one-third that number in
retaliation.

   Michael Dukakis, emerging from unity talks with
Jesse Jackson on the opening day of the Democratic National
Convention, guaranteed his unbowed rival a major role in the
presidential campaign. Jackson said he would not mount a challenge
for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Dukakis said they struck no deals, but predicted they would
forge ``the strongest grass-roots organization'' ever formed in a
campaign for the White House.
   In turn, Jackson said, ``We intend to win'' in November, though
he did not offer an outright endorsement of Dukakis. ``I'm still
looking for a Chicago miracle'' on Wednesday night, when the
presidential nominating roll is called, Jackson said.
   ``If the miracle does not come to pass, then we'll have pass
over to the next phase of our campaign,'' Jackson said, with a
smile.
   Dukakis, the inevitable nominee of the party, cracked, ``I don't
think we're going to have a Chicago miracle, but we're going to
have an Athenian miracle,'' a reference to his Greek heritage.
   At a later meeting with more than 2,000 supporters and
delegates, Jackson sounded a conciliatory note that the Dukakis
campaign no doubt hopes will hold through the convention.
   The two leaders held about two hours of talks in an Atlanta
hotel just hours before 4,000-plus delegates gather for the opening
session of a convention that will crown Dukakis as the presidential
nominee Thursday night.
   Tonight's highlight is the keynote address by Texas State
Treasurer Ann Richards, a fiery populist who allowed that she was
``terribly nervous'' about her prime-time speech.
   If the Democrats can keep to their tightly scripted _ and
frequently altered _ schedule, the convention will be called to
order at precisely 6:01 p.m. EDT and run until 11 p.m. EDT. The
three networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, will cover the final two hours of
the gathering.
   Republicans, meanwhile, gloated about the attention Jackson is
stealing from the nominee-in-waiting. Former White House political
strategist Ed Rollins, at a GOP ``truth squad'' news conference,
quoted Dukakis as saying there can only be one quarterback for the
campaign.
   ``Far more important is, who is going to be the coach?'' Rollins
said. ``Is Jesse Jackson going to call the shots?''
   Tensions have been running high between the campaigns ever since
Dukakis passed over Jackson last week and picked Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen as his running mate.
   Trying to smooth differences and placate Jackson's supporters,
Dukakis declared ``I want Jesse Jackson to play a major role in
this campaign. I want his supporters ... to be deeply involved.''
   However, Dukakis acknowledged he had not forged an agreement
with Jackson.
   ``There's no deal; there's no fine print,'' said Dukakis.
``That's not the way you win elections.''
   Jackson, who had been pressuring Dukakis for what he called
shared responsibility in Democratic affairs, said, ``We're on a
track that would lead to expanded involvement.''
   He played down his demands, which sources say call for a major
role for Jackson in shaping the administration if Dukakis wins. ``I
made it very clear today ... I seek no job, no salary, not title,''
Jackson said. ``I seek to serve, to keep America strong and to make
America beautiful.''
   Bentsen joined Dukakis and Jackson at a standing room only news
confernce. ``There's been a reaching out on both sides and bringing
those forces together. This truly is the politics of inclusion,''
said Bentsen, whose moderate-to-conservative views have drawn
criticism from Jackson and his supporters.
   Despite his unhappiness about Dukakis' selection of Bentsen,
Jackson said, ``We have no plans to submit my name in nomination''
for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Moreover, he said, ``there will
be no encouragement of anyone to do it.''
   Platform negotiations, which had been suspended by Jackson, were
back on track, Jackson said.
   He said after the Wednesday night nomination vote, which Dukakis
has more than enough delegates to win, the campaign moves in a
fundamental new direction and the roles will change.
   ``He is going to be involved, actively and fully in a way that
will bring us together and will build the strongest grass roots
organization we hope that has ever been organized in a presidential
campaign,'' Dukakis said.
   While it was clear that not all differences had been resolved,
Dukakis said, ``We'll be campaigning together. We'll be campaigning
separately but he'll be a very, very important part of this team.''
   Dukakis said they would make an effort to ``bring into our
campaign'' key people from Jackson's camp.
   The meeting was the first face-to-face discussion between
Dukakis and Jackson since a July 4 dinner at the Massachusetts'
governor's home in Brookline. Though they have talked by telephone,
they had not met since Dukakis picked Bentsen as his running mate.
   ``We made the judgment not to let our ships pass in the night,
not let our ships crash,'' Jackson said.
   As the delegates made their way to this sweltering convention
city, the Dukakis-Jackson rift was Topic A.
   Sources said Jackson wanted an agreement outlining an official
role in the fall campaign, including financial support from
Dukakis. It was not clear whether Jackson had explicitly asked
Dukakis to provide him with a charter jet to travel in.
   Dukakis aides said they would welcome campaign efforts by
Jackson, but that any funds would have to come from the Democratic
Party.
   Accompanied by Bentsen, Dukakis arrived here Sunday. He defended
his choice of a running mate and at the same time took a dig at the
Reagan administration for the Iran-Contra affair.
   Dukakis said he picked Bentsen because ``if there is somebody at
the National Security Council who comes to me with a cockamamie
idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages,
he's (Bentsen) going to come into my office and pound the desk and
say, `Mr. President, that's crazy.'''
   Bentsen, in turn, said the Massachusetts governor ``speaks a
language we understand in the South'' _ jobs and education.
   With assistance from a Hollywood production company, the stage
was finally set at the Omni for a convention celebration that will
conclude Thursday night with Dukakis claiming the presidential
nomination he set out 17 months ago to win.
   The main podium is fixed on a three-tier platform that towers 85
feet high at its highest point and is 120 feet wide and 100 feet
deep. Thousands of seats had to be ripped out to make way for the
huge structure, eating up already scarce space.

   Iran unconditionally accepted a U.N.
resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in its war with
Iraq, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said today.
   The acceptance came just hours before the Security Council was
to resume debate on the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iran jetliner in
the Persian Gulf.
   The secretary-general said he would begin consultations with
Iran and Iraq today to arrange a cease-fire and hopes it could take
effect in a week.
   ``I intend in the afternoon to start my consultations to begin
to set up a D-day for the implemention for the resolution. Of
course, it has to begin with a cease-fire,'' said Perez de Cuellar.
   He showed reporters at the U.N. Secretariat building the letter
of acceptance signed by Iran's president, Ali Khamenei.
   ``They say that have decided to officially declare that the
republic of Iran accepts Security Council Resolution 598,'' said
Perez de Cuellar.
   When asked if Iran still insisted on punishment or denunciation
of Iraq as a first step toward a cease-fire, the secretary-general
said:
   ``There is no (such) reference in the letter. It is a very
factual letter, there is no claim, no conditions ... It is very
clear that it is an acceptance which doesn't refer to any
conditions.''
   ``It is what they (the Iranians) call `official acceptance.'
They considered that before they have always tacitly accepted the
resolution. Now they say, `We have officially accepted it,''' said
Perez de Cuellar.
   Word of Iran's acceptance of the U.N. resolution first came
today from that nation's Islamic Republic New Agency, which quoted
a military statement. It also said Iran would not withdraw troops
from its borders.
   Iraq already has agreed to the Security Council resolution,
which passed on July 20, 1987, but Iran had not previously accepted
or rejected the resolution, claiming that Iraq must first be
identified as the aggressor in the war.
   An Iraqi diplomat, U.N. counsellor Mudhafar A. Al-Amin, said
today that his government would have to study Iran's letter before
reacting to it. There has been no official reaction from Bagdhad.
   Security Council members and guest speakers have been pressing
Iran to accept Resolution 598 during debate on the Iran jetliner
disaster, which began Thursday when Vice President George Bush and
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati presented their
countries' cases.
   On Friday, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union _ who
along with America make up the five permanent members of the
Security Council _ called on Iran to abide by the cease-fire
resolution to end the nearly 8-year-old war.
   Iran had effectively boycotted the council for eight years,
contending that it favors Iraq.
   In the council debate, Iran had initially called for
condemnation of America for shooting down the Iranian jetliner on
July 3, killing all 290 peopl aboard, most of whom were Iranian.
   Late last week, however, it became apparent that Iran could not
muster enough votes on the council to condemn the United States,
and Iranian diplomats fell back to demanding that America accept
full responsibility for the tragedy and that the U.S. Navy leave
the gulf region.
   Iran's acceptance of the cease-fire resolution will strengthen
its argument in the council that all foreign navies should leave
the region, since a cease-fire would make their presence to protect
shipping unnecessary.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen declared today that Democrats
had ``put it all together'' with Jesse Jackson's promise to
campaign for the ticket.
   Bentsen, Michael Dukakis' choice for running mate, joined the
Massachusetts governor and Jackson for a news conference in which
the three men spoke of new unity reached in closed-door meetings.
   ``There has been a reaching out on both sides,'' said the Texas
senator.
   He predicted a tough fight in November. ``But with this kind of
unity and the motivational work of Jesse Jackson and the leadership
of Michael Dukakis ... I'm convinced we're going to win a great
victory in November,'' he said.
   Bentsen was making the rounds to state delegations today to woo
delegates not yet supporting his addition to the ticket.
   At a New Jersey delegation meeting, prior to the joint press
conference, he was greeted with applause but also some Jackson
signs. Afterward, he went to the Ohio delegation and received a
warm welcome _ even though many Ohioans wanted their senator, John
Glenn, as the vice presidential candidate.
   ``I just left a meeting with Governor Dukakis and Jesse Jackson
and we have put it all together,'' he said, to extended cheers.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste said Bentsen was needed to ``put a
little more shoulder to the wheel in Texas'' and that the Democrats
would win Ohio anyway.
   Glenn, who was also wished a happy birthday by Bentsen, said
``it's going to be a great day when this tall-in-the-saddle Texan
right here becomes the vice president of the United States.''
   The Texas senator and the Massachusetts governor swept into town
Sunday for their party's national convention and declared their
partnership one of mutual admiration.
   Making their first joint appearance in the convention city at a
party hosted by Cable News Network, the two men traded accolades.
Dukakis called Bentsen ``a man whom I have admired and respected
for some time.''
   Bentsen, who has been candid about differences he has with some
of Dukakis' views, beamed and applauded. For his part, Bentsen said
Dukakis ``speaks a language we understand in the South'' _ jobs and
education.
   When people ``talk about the electoral vote lock that the
Republicans have on the South, I don't believe that one for a
minute,'' Bentsen said. ``We're going to win Georgia and Texas and
state after state across this country.''
   Bentsen was greeted at the event by former President Jimmy
Carter and Georgia's two Democratic senators, Wyche Fowler and Sam
Nunn. Nunn praised the Bentsen choice, saying ``Mike Dukakis will
head a balanced ticket with a broad strength and appeal.''
   He said the party was appealing to ``the mainstream Democrats
who have long been the anchor of our party, and also mainstream
Americans.''
   Nunn predicted unity among the Democrats that would pay off in
November with a victory. But a more immediate task for Dukakis and
Bentsen this week is to resolve problems ranging from dismay among
liberals at a man they see as too conservative to anger among
Jackson's supporters that the veteran civil rights activist was not
picked for the No. 2 spot.
   In the New Jersey delegation, for example, Assemblyman Alan
Karcher said he was ``not happy with Bentsen.''
   ``We want to know about his positions,'' he said.
   Bentsen on Sunday suggested his position on the ticket was
already helping Dukakis, apparently referring to a Houston
Chronicle-Dallas Morning News poll showing the Democratic ticket
had pulled even with the Republicans in Texas.
   Another poll, in the Chicago Tribune, indicated that the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket led Bush in California, New York and

<HEAD>Industry Operating Rates Edge Closer to Inflation-Producing Level</HEAD>

   U.S. industry in June operated at its highest
point in eight years, edging closer to a level that economists
believe signals a pickup in inflation, the government said Monday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said American factories, mines and
utilities operated at 83.1 percent of capacity last month, up 0.2
percentage points from May.
   It was the third consecutive monthly increase, the seventh rise
in nine months and the highest level since March 1980, when the
operating rate was 83.7 percent.
   ``We're in the danger zone,'' said David Jones, an economist
with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government securities dealer. ``We
are pushing back up to the levels we saw back at the beginning of
the decade when we saw more inflation.''
   Jones predicted that by the fall, operating rates would move
past 85 percent, the level economists believe indicates the
presence of inflationary production bottlenecks. The concern is
that as companies have difficulty meeting demand and their products
become more scarce, prices will rise.
   Capacity constraints are usual in an economy in its 67th month
of expansion, but Jones said the drought in the Farm Belt, a
tightening labor market and the recent increase in the value of the
dollar are combining to worsen the inflation pressures that would
normally be present.
   Last month, the drought sent grain and poultry prices soaring by
more than 20 percent, unemployment dropped to a 14-year low of 5.3
percent, and the dollar rose to its highest level since last fall,
a development that could eventually increase import prices.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in testimony to
Congress last week, warned that the Fed will push interest rates
higher, if necessary, to combat inflation. He said unemployment and
factory operating rates will have to level off to avoid
accelerating price increases.
   The June operating rate of 83.1 percent was 2.8 percentage
points higher than a year ago. However, the breakdown by industry
in the Federal Reserve report may ease inflation fears somewhat.
   ``Some of the areas that have been the tightest don't seem to be
getting any worse,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data
Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   The operating rate at plants making petroleum products dropped
from 85.5 percent in May to 84.5 percent in June; textiles, from
91.8 percent in April to 90.7 percent in May, the latest month
available; and rubber and plastics, from 88.1 percent in April to
87.3 percent in May.
   Another hopeful sign, Latta said, are plans by U.S. businesses
to increase building and equipment purchases by 11.9 percent this
year. If realized, that would be the biggest gain in four years and
should lead, she said, to an easing of operating rates by late this
year or early next year.
   ``Also, any time industries add capacity, it tends to be state
of the art and it tends to be more efficient. That should alleviate
prices pressures somewhat. Foreign competition is still very stiff,
so companies will do their best to avoid cost increases and
increase productivity,'' she said.
   The operating rate at manufacturing plants, which has been
pushed up by a boom in exports, held steady at 83.2 percent in June.
   A 0.1 percentage point increase to 81.7 percent at plants making
durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more
years _ was offset by a 0.2 percentage point decline to 85.2
percent at plants making non-durable goods.
   The operating rate in the mining industry, which includes oil
drilling, rose from 81.4 percent to 82.1 percent in June.
   At utilities, the June rate jumped 2.0 percentage points to 81.8
percent. Electric utilities, which increased output to keep air
conditioners going during the heat wave, had an operating rate of
85.4 percent, up 2.6 percentage points over May.
   In the steel industry and other primary metals manufacturing,
the rate was down 0.2 percentage points to 87.2 percent in June.
   Manufacturers of motor vehicles and parts reported a June drop
of 0.3 percentage points to 83.4 percent. The decline followed
three steep increases from the 76.8 percent rate in February.
   The rate at paper plants increased by 0.1 percentage point to
95.0 percent in May, but that was below the 97.0 percent peak last
December. The rate at chemical plants rose 0.2 percentage points to
86.2 percent in May.

<TEXT>
   During the idle hours at the Democratic National
Convention _ and there are many _ delegates turn into party-goers,
souvenir-seekers, shoppers, diners and, with the rest of Atlanta,
sufferers in the heat.
   The only thing that delegates to the Democratic National
Convention don't do much of is sleep.
   The official convention schedule fills five hours a day. But
there is no shortage of things for the delegates to do with the
remaining 19.
   In the big hotels downtown, convention-goers have a chance to
get their picture taken with Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, the
stars of the week. For $5 you can put your arm around them, lean on
their shoulders and take home a moment in history.
   The only problem is these are life-sized cardboard cutouts, not
the real people. There are so many of them around Atlanta, they are
like Santa Clauses at Christmas time.
   ``Pose with the next president,'' said a sign. ` `Cast your vote
now.''
   Oops. One woman was heard complaining, ``Why don't they have
Lloyd Bentsen.''
   The Macy's store, in the heart of the delegate hotels, proclaims
itself ``the life of the party '88.''
   Sylvia Farmer from Boston thought so. For the price of a picture
frame, she sat while a caricaturist drew her face next to a
Democratic donkey. Mrs. Farmer is not a delegate and nobody in her
family is.
   What they are is Democrats and this is the place for Democrats
to be this week.
   ``I'm for Dukakis and half of my family is for Dukakis and half
for Jackson,'' she said.
   An aisle away, Chef Henry Haller, who worked in the White House
and still wears the presidential seal on his white smock, was
giving a cooking demonstration involving oranges and a liqueur. A
sales woman was passing out printed recipes of what Haller was
cooking, including ``Nancy Reagan's Cointreau Orange Flambe.'' Even
in Atlanta this week, some matters are vital enough to transcend
party lines.
   Besides, Haller was the Reagans' cook for their first six years
in the White House. He ended his service there last September after
cooking for presidents for 21 years.
   Delegates with time on their hands _ there weren't many _ stop
at ``The Protest Zone,'' a parking lot a block from The Omni where
issues were aired by speakers hour after hour under the broiling
sun and then deep into the night.
   At one point, there were more than 50 riot-helmeted policemen
protecting the citizenry from one speaker and four listeners.
   The police themselves became a point of curiosity. Two cops, one
male and one female, were photographed by a television crew. ``Why
did he want to take my picture?'' the policeman asked his partner.
``They are from out of town,'' she said.

   House Speaker Jim Wright, chairman of the
Democrats' 40th national convention, said Monday the party's
all-but-certain nominee, Michael Dukakis, must be not appear
ungracious in giving Jesse Jackson a prominent role in the fall
campaign.
   ``I think it's up to Dukakis to do what he does graciously, not
begrudgingly,'' Wright said.
   With the two rivals meeting face to face to define Jackson's
role, ``I think the healing already has begun,'' Wright said. ``I
think they're closing ranks.''
   Wright said he had spoken with both men since Dukakis
disappointed many Jackson backers by passing over Jackson for the
No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   ``Jesse Jackson simply wants to feel involved, respected. The
role is becoming defined now. Last week, he was concerned that it
was amorphous,'' Wright said in an interview with a small group of
reporters.
   He said the agreement would encompass such issues as Jackson's
campaign duties and arrangements for his travel and staff. ``All
that is a part of it,'' Wright said.
   But he said there should be no sharp public lines drawn by
either side about what that role should be. ``To set up arbitrary
standards ... for each to prove he's a man is juvenile in the
extreme, utterly childish,'' said Wright.
   He said advisers in both camps had apparently been setting up
that kind of confrontation.
   ``Some of Mike's friends say, `Are you gonna let him get away
with that?' Mike's smarter than that. If you had two stupid men,
you'd have an irreconcilable situation. But they are both smarter
men, more mature than that.''
   Wright said he believes Jackson's long-range future in the party
will be one of prominence, but he declined to be specific.
   ``The convention is not Jesse Jackson's finish line, it's his
starting line,'' he said.
   Wright said he expected all but three or four planks of the
party's platform to be settled through compromises, and said the
handful that remain the subject of floor fights will not be on
matters that damage the party's run for the White House.
   Wright predicted the week-long convention meeting would end as
``a love-in'' but acknowledged, ``it just takes us a little while
to get there.''
   He said his role as chairman of the convention would be largely
in the background.
   ``I don't have any illusions that the chairman runs the
convention,'' he said. ``He lets it run itself and just helps see
that it doesn't run off the track.'' He said he planned to share
duties of presiding over the sessions with his four co-chairmen,
former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya, Rep. Norm Mineta of California,
Mayor Lottie Shackelford of Little Rock, Ark., and Gov. Madeleine
Kunin of Vermont.
   Wright said his own much-publicized ethics case pending before a
House investigating committee would not be an issue at the
convention, asserting that ``the public sees through'' the charges
and believes they are politically motivated.
   He said as he has traveled around the country speaking since the
charges were leveled by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., audiences have
been supportive. ``I've had people come up to me and say, `I'm a
Republican, but I deeply resent the manner in which these people
are trying to blacken your reputation,''' Wright said.

<HEAD>Excerpts From Iranian Statement On Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iran-Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from a statement
released Monday by Iran's General Command and transmitted in
English by the Islamic Republic News Agency on Iran's acceptance of
U.N. Resolution 598 calling for an immediate cease-fire with Iraq:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The day the oppressive regime of Iraq violated Iran's territory,
the nation fully realized that the savage aggression was the result
of an international plot to damage the Islamic revolution ...
   Today new conditions have been created which call for adoption
of new stances in order to continue the sacred defense and protect
Islam and the Islamic revoluton.
   Although the enemies of Islam have not for a moment stopped
their plots against the Islamic revoluton, recently as the blows of
Muslim combatants of Iran on the battered body of Iraq became more
deadly the scope of plots became wider.
   The world arrogance (United States) as well as the reactionaries
came to help Iraq with all their power.
   In order to damage the revolution they did not spare any
criminal act and tried to uphold the Baghdad regime through their
massive military, financial, political, and propaganda assistance,
and armed the Iraqi army with massive weapons and aids for fresh
aggressions and continued crimes...
   Today, the whole reactionary and arrogant worlds are trying to
portray our enemy which has committed unprecedented crimes in the
history of the world as a peace-loving regime and on the contrary
misportray our innocent and resistant nation which has always
sought, and still is seeking to thwart the aggression, as
war-mongering Muslims before world public opinion...
   In addition, they (arrogant and reactionary worlds) put utmost
pressure on Iran and threaten the Iranian nation.
   Under such circumstances, it is natural for us to try to expose
the aggressor and prevent the enemies of Islam and those who are
against the independence of nations from taking initiative in
international scenes.
   The announcement of the Islamic Republic's new stand to U.N.
Chief Javier Perez de Cuellar is aimed at implementing this new
policy.
   It is beyond question that defending Islam and acting bravely is
not an act peculiar only to the battlefields but that adoption of
new methods which can tip the balance to the advantage of Islam and
foil enemy plots speaks for courage in its own right.
   At this crucial juncture, the armed forces General Command
headquarters ... deems it necessary to stress the following points:
   1. In continuation of the previous statements released by the
armed forces General Command headquarters we once again urge the
Iranian people to man the war fronts to confront enemies'
aggressive nature and foil their criminal acts. Our brave military
commanders are still doing all within their power to continue
safeguarding the Islamic revolution...
   2. What has happened is expedient by divine assignment...
   3. The great leadership of Imam Khomeini who has successfully
led the Islamic revolution even in the most crucial juncture is
still the most reliable shelter for the freedom loving people of
Iran whose hearts have been enlightened by such a leadership ...

   Democratic National Convention delegate Jeanne
Milko of Pittsburgh says her policy of openness as party chairwoman
for Allegheny County does not include sharing the contents of her
suitcase with Georgia motorists.
   En route to Atlanta on Saturday, her suitcase popped open on top
of a shuttle to the Pennsylvania delegation's hotel, distributing
her belongings over the road.
   Allegheny County Controller Frank Lucchino, his wife Bobbie, and
delegate Sal Sirabella dodged traffic on Interstate 75 to retrieve
the scattered items.
   ``I lost my underwear. I lost earrings, deodorant, hair spray,''
said Mrs. Milko. ``My husband doesn't even see my underwear, but
now half of the people in Atlanta have seen it.''

   VIPs feeling miffed at being barred from the
center of the action during the Democratic National Convention
shouldn't feel too bad _ even the organizer's mother can't get a
floor pass.
   Jane Kahn, mother of Atlanta '88 Committee President Bobby Kahn,
said she and her husband probably would wind up, like so many
others, watching the convention in the special VIP room at the
nearby Georgia World Congress Center.
   Bobby Kahn, 30, was executive director of the Georgia Democratic
Party when efforts began to bring the 1988 convention to Atlanta.
He headed the successful drive, then moved to the Atlanta '88
corporation that was set up to manage preparations.
   ``He told us we can't get on the floor during the convention,''
Mrs. Kahn, of Savannah, said a little wistfully. ``There are too
many requests, and he'll bend over backwards not to show favoritism.
   ``I may get to be an elector if Michael Dukakis wins in Georgia.
But, when Bobby brought me the papers to sign for that, he told me
it still wouldn't get us on the convention floor.''

<HEAD>Cuomo Says Dukakis Close To Sure Thing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo told fellow New York Democrats
on Monday that Michael Dukakis was ``as close to a sure thing (to
be elected president) as we've seen for Democrats in the last 20 or
40 years.''
   Cuomo's comment, in a speech to the New York delegation to this
week's national party convention, came soon after Dukakis and rival
Jesse Jackson met and then declared party unity.
   ``That's wonderful,'' said Cuomo at a subsequent news conference
when asked about the Dukakis-Jackson peace pact. ``It means that
what we all predicted with 100 percent confidence, and with just a
little trepidation, has apparently occurred. They're going to work
together for the common good.''
   Cuomo, who was propelled to national prominence by his keynote
address four years ago, has no formal role at this year's
convention. He and his wife Matilda met briefly with this year's
keynoter, Texas state treasurer Ann Richards, at the Omni
convention hall and presented her with a Steuben glass apple.
   At his news conference, Cuomo said he was certain there were no
secret deals made between Dukakis and Jackson and said such a move
would be ``dumb.''
   ``From what I know of Mike Dukakis, he would not make a deal
he'd be afraid to reveal,'' said Cuomo, adding that he'd been in
regular contact with both men over the past few days.
   As Cuomo made his remarks at the downtown hotel where the New
York delegation is staying, supporters of Tawana Brawley staged the
first of what they said would be twice-daily demonstrations. The
black teen-ager says she was abducted and sexually abused last year
in New York's Dutchess County by six white men, one of whom flashed
a badge like a police officer's.
   Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda Brawley, marched with her sister,
Juanita, the Rev. Al Sharpton and about 60 other people, while
attorney C. Vernon Mason chanted through a bullhorn.
   ``New York's like Mississippi used to be,'' Mason said. ``New
York's like Alabama used to be. Down South's up North now.''
   He also chanted: ``Mario Cuomo is a racist.''
   Sharpton has complained about Cuomo's handling of the Brawley
investigation, claiming that authorities are mounting a coverup. On
the advice of Sharpton and others, Brawley has refused to cooperate
with Cuomo's special prosecutor in the case, state Attorney General
Robert Abrams.
   Cuomo said Miss Brawley's mother will eventually be arrested for
refusing to appear before a grand jury reviewing evidence into the
allegations. But he said, ``They'll do it when it's safe and right.
We're not going to make a bad situation worse.''
   Miss Brawley is also in Atlanta, but she did not appear at the
demonstration.

<TEXT>
   An American mountain climber died
earlier this month in a blizzard in the Himalaya mountains between
Pakistan and India, his climbing partner reported Monday.
   ``I'm dying. I just want to get warm,'' were the last words of
Gary Silver, 40, of Spokane, Wash., according to his friend Gary
Speer, who was with him on an expedition that took them to
Gasherbrum 2, a 26,400-foot peak in the Karakorum range in the
western Himalayas.
   Speer, 36, returned to Islamabad on Sunday.
   Speer and Silver left the Pakistani capital city along with two
other American climbers, who abandoned the expedition at the outset
when one of them couldn't breathe at the high altitude.
   On July 1, Speer and Silver, who had had climbing experience in
North and South America, headed up from a base camp at 17,000 feet.
   At 19,000 feet, Silver also became sick and decided to return to
the base camp, while Speer continued alone.
   When he came to within 100 feet of the peak, high winds forced
him to descend to 23,000 feet. There, he found Silver, who had
teamed up with a Canadian doctor, Roland Willenbrock, to try to
reach the top of the mountain.
   The two ignored Speer's warning that a snowstorm was brewing and
continued toward the summit. The exhausted Speer headed back.
   For three days, a blizzard trapped Silver and Willenbrock at a
camp at 24,000 feet.
   On July 8, the two began their descent, but at 23,000 feet
Silver could not continue and Willenbrock contacted Speer by radio.
   According to Willenbrock, Silver told the doctor, ``I'm going to
die.''
   He later became unconscious and died from cerebral edema, a
swelling of the brain from lack of oxygen.
   Willenbrock began walking toward the lower camp in the blizzard
and mostly in the dark to reach Speer at the lower camp.
   On July 9 at 3 a.m., Speer mounted a rescue party of two Swiss
and two American climbers to find Silver's body.
   The doctor, who had planned to specialize in heart surgery,
suffered frostbite and will lose some of the fingers on his right
hand, Speer said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said Monday that the Rev.
Jesse Jackson was stealing the spotlight at the Democratic
convention from Michael Dukakis and urged that the party unite to
win the White House.
   ``We ought to get together, no demands. Let the guy run for
president,'' Koch said in an interview with reporters at City Hall.
   Jackson has been demanding ``full partnership'' with Dukakis in
the upcoming campaign.
   Koch said, ``I happen to think the largest number of people
respond to the quarterback. The quarterback in this case is
Dukakis. He represents, reflects the mainstream Democratic
politics.''
   The mayor said, ``I think it is a huge error on the part of
whose who are seeking to diminish the Dukakis role by making
demands upon him which he can't respond to.''
   Koch is not going to the convention. He said that if Dukakis had
asked him to be a delegate he would have. Instead, he is going to
Ireland on a pilgrimage for peace in Northern Ireland with Cardinal
John O'Connor.
   During the New York primary this spring, Koch backed Tennessee
Sen. Al Gore over Dukakis and attacked Jackson, saying that Jews
who support Israel would be ``crazy'' to vote for him because of
his pro-Palestinian positions.

   A Navy helicopter on a mine-detection
exercise exploded over the sea Monday, and officials feared all
eight crew members were killed, a Coast Guard official said.
   A search was under way in the area, 11 miles west of the Golden
Gate Bridge, but a Coast Guard spokesman said rescuers did not
expect to find survivors.
   The cause of the blast was not immediately known.
   The crew of a private vessel, the Northern Lights, reported
hearing two explosions about 11 a.m. and then ``saw the helicopter
disappear from the sky,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Thomas
Cowan.
   ``There were eight people on board. We expect no survivors,''
said Cowan. He said search crews found ``a lot of wreckage.''
   Cowan had said six bodies were found, but later said he had been
speculating and that seven helmets were found but no fatalities had
been confirmed.
   Three helicopters _ two from the Navy and one from the Coast
Guard _ joined the Cutty Blackhaw, two smaller Coast Guard vessels
and the Northern Lights in the search.
   Cowan said searchers were hampered by fog that reduced
visibility to 150 yards.
   Navy spokeswoman Virginia Felker said the helicopter was
attached to Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15, based at Alameda
Naval Air Station on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay.
   She said the helicopter was conducting routine mine
countermeasure operation that involved using radar equipment and
pulling a weighted sled to simulate towing a mine.

<TEXT>
   American officials, sifting through several
claims of responsibility, have concluded that the Palestinian Abu
Nidal organization probably conducted the July 11 attack that
killed nine people aboard a Greek cruise ship.
   But the United States is not certain whether Libya, Abu Nidal's
main benefactor, commissioned the attack on the City of Poros
cruise liner sailing in the Aegean Sea.
   ``The method of operation, the style of the attack all point to
Abu Nidal,'' one official said. ``But we have to be cautious about
the linkage to Libya,'' added the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, gets much of his
funding from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and maintains
headquarters in Tripoli.
   American counterterrorism officials contend that since the U.S.
aerial bombing on Libya two years ago, Gadhafi has been using
surrogate groups to carry out terror attacks against the United
States. But the official said that in some terror attacks ``it's
not clear-cut whether Libya ordered them or maybe it was just a
wink and nod kind of thing'' in which Gadhafi gave implicit
approval.
   Callers have claimed that at least three groups carried out the
gunfire and grenade assault on the City of Poros, in which 98
people were wounded. The groups are: the Organization of the
Martyrs of the Popular Revolution in Palestine; the Islamic Jihad
group believed to be holding some Western hostages in Lebanon; and
the Jewish Defense League, whose spokesman has denied an anonymous
claim of responsibility.
   ``None of these ring any bells. They sound like hoaxes,'' said
the American official.
   Another official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the attack was similar to those carried out simultaneously at the
Vienna and Rome airports in December 1985, in which 19 people were
killed and more than 100 wounded. There is also similarity with the
1986 attack on an Istanbul, Turkey, synagogue in which more than 20
people were killed, he said.
   ``Running in, shooting and throwing grenades seems to be the
method in all these cases,'' the first official said.
   He discounted reports that the cruise liner attack was intended
to gain freedom for a Palestinian arrested in Greece last month
whose extradition is being sought by the United States in
connection with the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner in Hawaii.
   ``This has the earmarks of a long-planned event, not something
put together on the spur of the moment,'' he said.
   The Palestinian arrested in Greece, Mohammed Rashid, has been
charged with entering the country with a forged Syrian passport.
Greece is reportedly reluctant to extradite him to the United
States, saying it does not have sufficient proof of his culpability.

<HEAD>Floor Space Inside Convention Hall at a Premium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Those who frequent conventions to see and be seen
are facing a monumental challenge at this year's Democratic
gathering, where the only thing scarcer than podium time is floor
space inside the convention hall.
   The paucity of floor passes, even for high-ranking officials and
party operatives, has prompted party officials to convert the
Georgia World Congress Center across from The Omni into a giant
consolation prize of invitation-only parties and other events to
ease the pain of exile.
   ``Judging by the amount of cavorting and schmoozing I saw in the
hallways yesterday, that plan is working out fine,'' DNC spokesman
Mike McCurry said Monday.
   The podium schedule is continually shifting and expanding,
reflecting the intense lobbying efforts of governors, mayors and
congressional candidates to gain exposure. Their moments in the
spotlight fall outside the prime-time window of network TV
coverage, but there's more than enough compensation in the hundreds
of newspapers and TV stations voracious for local news and
personalities.
   ``Podium time is a good boost for these candidates. They'll
certainly be covered in their print outlets,'' said Anita Dunn,
spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   Her group managed to get eight candidates _ including six
challengers _ onto the Tuesday night schedule. In a Saturday
edition of the program, the segment is listed as a 10-minute
introduction of the Senate contenders. By Monday, the candidates
had won 19 minutes and the right to make brief remarks.
   Not to be outdone, the House Congressional Campaign Committee
went to bat for its own candidates. ``We are co-equal branches of
government,'' winked the committee chairman, Beryl Anthony, D-Ark.
In the revised schedule released Monday, the Wednesday session
opens 39 minutes earlier; 31 of them are devoted to remarks about
and introductions of the House hopefuls.
   The governors apparently weighed in, as well; the new Wednesday
schedule gave those from Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Kentucky four
to five minutes each for speeches that are nowhere to be found in
earlier schedules.
   Other late additions to the week included speeches by House
Majority Leader Tom Foley of Washington and District of Columbia
Mayor Marion Barry, a Jesse Jackson supporter; and introductions of
Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 vice presidential candidate, and
someone identified only as ``the Young Delegate.''
   Who lost? Bob Farmer, the miracle fund-raiser of the Dukakis
campaign, was slashed from four minutes to two; House Speaker Jim
Wright went from 14 minutes to 10; and Sen. Christopher Dodd of
Connecticut fell from 10 minutes to six. A videotape highlighting
the career of DNC Secretary Dorothy Bush was cut in half and six
minutes were trimmed from the time allowed for vice presidential
nominations.
   McCurry said speakers have been astonishingly cooperative about
keeping their remarks brief. ``We've been able to persuade them
that four minutes on the podium constitutes a major address,'' he
said.
   While convention planners can add a few minutes here and
subtract a few there to accommodate heavyweight requests for podium
time, there is virtually nothing they can do to supplement the
meager floor space in the Omni.
   Many who thought they were political insiders are being left
out, victims of the limited passes available and the DNC's
first-preference policy for working journalists and technicians
responsible for communicating the week's events to the taxpayers
who are footing the bill.
   The pressure, McCurry said, is coming ``mostly from party
dignitaries, fund-raisers, operatives and staff people'' who are
not delegates. The closest they may get to the convention is a
World Congress Center auditorium with a big screen on which to
watch the proceedings.
   If the DNC succeeds, as McCurry says it has, the refuseniks
won't mind _ they'll be happily diverted by parties, receptions and
hospitality suites sprinkled with ``notables'' to make them feel
like they're part of the action.
   ``The whole plot is to turn the WCC into the high-prestige place
to rub elbows,'' said Mary Jane Gallagher, a consultant to the DNC
press office.
   Scott Widmeyer, another consultant, said he is already convinced
of that. ``With 20,000 people milling around, this is the place to
conduct business. This is the place to buttonhole people,'' he
said. ``If you really want to be seen, this is the building to be
in.''

   A puppeteer, a firefighter who studies the
cultural history of fires, a student of Mexican sorcery and jazz
percussionist Max Roach are among this year's 31 winners of the
no-strings-attached MacArthur awards announced Tuesday.
   Andre Dubus, a Haverhill, Mass., short-story writer whose works
include ``The Last Worthless Evening,'' learned of his award last
week, as did the other recipients.
   His reaction?
   ``Gratitude so extreme that I haven't recovered from it yet,''
he said.
   Dubus, 51, who has been confined to a wheelchair since a car
accident two years ago, said, ``I've been using borrowed money for
the people who take care of me.'' He plans to invest his $310,000
grant ``to pay the people who take care of me until I die.''
   Recipients of the awards, from $150,000 to $375,000 over five
years, are free to spend the money any way they wish. Individuals
cannot apply for the grants; instead, they are nominated
anonymously and reviewed by a 15-member committee, with final
approval made by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation's board of directors.
   ``I figured out how to make it, you figure out how to spend
it,'' MacArthur told his board before he died in 1978. His wife
died shortly thereafter.
   The grant-making foundation is one of the largest private
philanthropic groups in the United States. MacArthur owned Bankers'
Life And Casualty insurance company.
   ``I'm still in kind of a state of shock about it,'' said
Hipolito Roldan, head of the Chicago-based Hispanic Housing
Development Corp., a private non-profit group that finds housing
for low-income Hispanic families in Chicago. His grant was $275,000.
   It was ``a bolt out of the blue,'' said Stephen J. Pyne, 39, an
environmental historian and professional firefighter who was given
$250,000.
   Other winners this year include novelist Thomas Pynchon, whose
works include ``Gravity's Rainbow''; Bruce D. Schwartz, a Los
Angeles puppeteer who draws from Japanese and European traditions;
and Ruth Behar, an anthropologist from Ann Arbor, Mich., who
studies Mexican sorcery and at 31 is the youngest recipient this
year.
   Roldan's group, with the help of outside investors, buys and
renovates vacant housing, then rents it at affordable prices to
working-class and poor families.
   Roldan said he would like to think that his work helps build
futures for Hispanic youths. ``Housing or a home is the place where
lives get built or shattered,'' he said.
   ``To the extent that a kid has a space, maybe even their own
room, to study in ... to plan for the future, is a very important
thing,'' said Roldan, 45.
   He said he may use his $275,000 award to help finance education
for needy youths, and ``maybe put some money away'' for college for
his own children, aged 11 and 12.
   Pyne, who studies how people have interacted with fire
throughout history, figures he was selected for ``doing kind of
original stuff, different kinds of things in environmental
history.''
   His book about the ways people have interacted with Antarctica,
titled ``The Ice,'' was on the New York Times' list of best books
of 1987. Pyne lives in Phoenix, Ariz.
   Another recipient was Anna Curtenius Roosevelt, an archaeologist
and granddaughter of President Theodore Roosevelt, who has been
studying ancient cultures of the tropical lowlands of South America
for nearly 15 years.
   ``We believe that we have found the earliest pottery in the New
World in a site near the city of Santarem in Brazil,'' she said
Monday from New York, where she is a visiting researcher at the
American Museum of Natural History.
   Ms. Roosevelt, 42, who won a $265,000 grant, said of the
MacArthur grants: ``The whole goal is to give you the freedom to
develop your research in the way that you see best.''
   Among previous winners are director Peter Sellars, filmmakers
John Sayles and Frederick Wiseman and choreographer Merce
Cunningham. A total of 254 MacArthur fellows have been named since
the program began in 1981, ranging in age from 18 to 82.
   Fellows receive their grants in increments over five years, with
largest totals going to the oldest recipients. Winners also receive
health insurance.
   ``We believe that in enabling these extraordinarily talented
individuals to discover and create free of financial constraints,
the Fellows Program makes a valuable contribution to American
scientific and cultural life,'' said John Corbally, MacArthur
Foundation president.

   Iran's acceptance of a truce in the war
with Iraq appears to be the work of Hashemi Rafsanjani, who
introduced a much less bellicose tone when he became military
commander last month.
   He hinted at a negotiated solution to the nearly 8-year-old
struggle and, after the U.S. Navy shot down an Iranian airliner
July 3, even cautioned against violent retaliation.
   Rafsanjani has built personal power through his job as speaker
of Iran's parliament, the Majlis.
   On June 2, several Iraqi military victories, revolutionary
patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini made him commander-in-chief
and he has emerged as the man most likely to hold temporal power
after the death of Khomeini, who is 88.
   Rafsanjani, 53, said on Iranian television Monday that Khomeini,
who set the previous policy to reject a cease-fire, made decided
Sunday to accept it.
   His recent statements would suggest Rafsanjani is a moderate,
but the word has little meaning in the murk of Iranian politics,
where positions come and go like ghosts in a fog.
   In a speech last month, Rafsanjani mentioned the possibility of
``non-military solutions to the war,'' but at Friday prayers July 8
he exhorted young men to go to the front ``to determine the fate of
the Iraqi imposed-war right there on the battlefield.''
   The first communique of his newly formed military General
Command said it was the duty of Iranians to ``resist and hope for
ultimate divine victory.''
   It said the goal was to mobilize all military and civilian
potential and change the military balance in Iran's favor.
   Rafsanjani also had suggested, however, that it was time for
Iran to emerge from its international isolation.
   As Iran announced its acceptance Monday of the year-old U.N.
Security Council truce resolution, the General Command said: ``We
once again urge the Iranian people to man the war fronts to
confront the enemies' aggressive nature and foil their criminal
acts.''
   Earlier this month, Rafsanjani said on Iranian television: ``One
of the wrong things we did, in the revolutionary atmosphere, was
constantly to make enemies. We pushed those who could have been
neutral into hostility.''
   Western diplomats said Monday most Iranians are weary of the war
and the leadership may be able to explain the policy shift with
relative ease, but that Iranians would be wrong to think ending the
war will bring a quick return to economic health.
   ``The economy is in a desolate state,'' one diplomat based in
Tehran said recently. ``Two-thirds of the country's industrial
capacity is idle. With spare parts and trained personnel lacking,
it will take years.''
   Since 1980, the year after Khomeini's revolution overthrew the
late Shah Mohammade Reza Pahlavi, Rafsanjani has dominated the
parliament. He has built support among the 350,000 Revolutionary
Guards Corps, which he briefly commanded, and other power centers.
   Iranians call him ``kuseh,'' the shark: some say for the
political ruthlessness and cunning that lie behind his smile and
sly wit, others say for his lack of facial hair, revealing his
Mongolian ancestry, in a nation of bearded men.
   Although Khomeini's designated heir is Ayatollah Hussein-Ali
Montazeri, most political analysts believe Rafsanjani will hold
real power with one or two others after the patriarch dies.
   Khomeini supported his temperate response to the destruction of
the airliner, in which 290 people were killed, with a message to
Montazeri, who had urged ``thorough plans for a struggle against
U.S. political, economic, cultural and military targets.''
   While he is close to Khomeini and considered the second most
powerful man in Iran, Rafsanjani's middle-level clerical rank of
hojatoleslam rules him out as the future ``wali-faqih,'' or supreme
spiritual leader.
   Rafsanjani helped give the Islamic revolution direction through
the turmoil of its early days and his rise to prominence was rapid.
   ``He's not brilliant as an organizer and he doesn't have
original ideas, but he's a manipulator and he's intelligent,'' said
Abolhassan Bani Sadr, the first Iranian president after the
revolution.
   Many Western leaders see Rafsanjani as the more acceptable face
of the Islamic revolution because he advocates links with the West.
That is not the result of less commitment to the revolution, but
because he believes Iran can gain from such dealings.
   He was at the center of the clandestine arms-for-hostages deal
with the United States in 1985-86 and, when it was uncovered,
Montazeri and other rivals sought to discredit him.
   Word of the secret dealings with ``the Great Satan'' _ the
United States _ was leaked to a Beirut magazine by Mehdi Hashemi,
brother-in-law of Montazeri's son.
   Displaying the political agility that has allowed him to survive
often- bloody infighting, Rafsanjani had Mehdi Hashemi arrested for
treason, murder and kidnapping, thus discrediting Montazeri.
   Hashemi and several associates were executed last September.

   Iran on Monday accepted a U.N. resolution
for a truce with Iraq in the nearly 8-year-old war that has cost an
estimated 1 million lives on both sides. Its military command said,
however, that its soldiers would stay at the front.
   The United States cautiously welcomed the move, saying it was
unsure of the intentions of Iran, which has suffered a recent
series of defeats. Iraq said its enemy made the decision for
``tactical reasons'' and not out of any desire for ``real and just
peace.''
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, parliament speaker and acting
commander-in-chief, said the decision was made by the 88-year-old
revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who had set
Iran's original policy of rejecting a truce.
   Security Council Resolution 598 of July 20, 1987, calls for a
cease-fire, withdrawal of military forces to recognized borders,
prisoner exchange and an investigation to determine who started the
nearly 8-year-old war.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, said he was
beginning consultations with both sides and a cease-fire could take
effect within a week.
   Iraq agreed to the Security Council resolution long ago, on
condition Iran also accepted it, but until Monday the Iranians had
said there could be no truce until Iraq was condemned as the
aggressor. The Iraqis invaded Iran in September 1980 after several
border skirmishes.
   On Sunday, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq urged Iranian
leaders to accept an ``honorable'' end to the conflict.
   Rafsanjani, who was promoted to military commander last month
and has set a less bellicose tone since then, said in an interview
on Iranian television Monday: ``Since the people of Iran believe in
Imam Khomeini's decisions and rely on him and the people in charge,
we hereby announce the decision to accept U.N. Security Council
Resolution 598.
   ``This decision is based on many reasons, but since Imam
Khomeini is aware of many political and military secrets, he cannot
give more explanations at the moment.''
   He said the decision was made ``for the benefit of the Iranian
nation and there is no sign of weakness in it.''
   Referring to the July 3 downing of the Iran Air jetliner by the
U.S. Navy that killed 290 people, Rafsanjani said, ``We took it as
a warning.''
   ``Poisonous propaganda was trying to pretend that we were the
war lovers and Saddam (Hussein) was the lover of peace,'' he said.
   ``Also, inside the country we have enemies who are trying to
condemn us because of not accepting the cease-fire,'' he said in a
rare open admission by a top official of discord inside Iran over
the war.
   ``But by approving the U.N. resolution our fight has not
ended,'' Rafsanjani added. ``According to the imam's order, we will
not have to fight on the war fronts for the moment while we wait to
see the U.N.'s final decision.''
   As Iran's acceptance of the resolution was conveyed Monday in a
message to Perez de Cuellar, a statement by Rafsanjani's new
military General Command said: ``We once again urge the Iranian
people to man the war fronts to confront the enemies' aggressive
nature and foil their criminal acts.''
   It praised the Khomeini's ``great leadership'' and, in a
reference to the United States, said the ``arrogant worlds'' sought
to portray Iraq as a ``peace-loving regime'' because it had
accepted Resolution 598.
   A dispatch carried by Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency said
the Iranian announcement was made for ``tactical reasons'' and not
from a desire for ``real and just peace.''
   The Reagan administration said it welcomed Iran's willingness to
accept the U.N. resolution.
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., President Reagan's spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater also said, ``I think we have to be cautious'' because
U.S. officials are unsure what Iran's intentions are.
   Fitzwater also refused to say how Iran's move would affect the
American military presence in the Persian Gulf, although he did say
the United States has been prepared to end tanker escorts if peace
came to the region.
   A government spokesman in Syria, the only major Arab backer of
Iran in the war, said his nation ``expresses its satisfaction and
welcomes the wise decision of the Iranian leadership.''
   Other Arab nations reacted cautiously. In Jordan, which has been
a key supporter of Iraq, Foreign Minister Taher Masri pointed out
there had been conflicting signals from Iran. The semi-official
Kuwait News Agency said the Iranian move ``brings joy.''
   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's ambassador to the United
Nations, also welcomed the Iranian move, but noted that it was
``overdue.''
   Several hours after the Iranian General Command statement was
distributed by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Iraq said
its helicopter gunships flew 61 sirties against Iranian positions
Monday, inflicting ``losses in men and equipment.''
   The Iranian message to Perez de Cuellar, released in New York,
said ``Iran _ because of the importance it attaches to saving the
lives of human beings and the establishment of justice and regional
and international peace and security _accepts Security Council
Resolution 598.''
   Iran's military command advocated a ``new policy'' to ``expose
the aggressor'' and ``prevent the enemies of Islam ...from taking
the initiative on the international scene.''
   ``The announcement of the Islamic Republic's new stands to U.N.
chief Javier Perez de Cuellar is aimed at implementing this new
policy,'' it said.
   Khomeini made Rafsanjani acting commander-in-chief June 2, and
Rafsanjani has indicated Iran might seek a negotiated end to the
war.
   Iran's military position has deteriorated. In three months, Iraq
has recaptured nearly all the territory it lost to Iran in six
years.
   Rafsanjani said in a speech June 15: ``We are not insisting on
getting our rights on the battlefield. We have defined non-military
solutions to the war.''
   Tehran's diplomatic position also has moderated since the U.S.
Navy shot an Iranian airliner down July 3 in the Persian Gulf,
killing all 290 people aboard. U.S. officials said the cruiser USS
Vincennes mistook the Airbus A300 for an Iranian F-14 fighter on an
attack course.
   In Baghdad, Information Minister Nassif Ltayyif Jassem expressed
``reservations'' in the first official Iraqi response to Iran's
acceptance of Resolution 598.
   ``The Iranian General Command's statement did not explain the
reasons behind Iran's new stand in terms of a desire for a real and
just peace, but ... in terms of tactical reasons,'' he said. ``He
who wants peace does not have to call for massing troops on the
front.''
   Iraq rejected an earlier Iranian assertion that both side had
returned to the 1980 international borders.
   ``Iran is still occupying parts of Iraqi territory here and
there,'' a Defense Ministry statement said. ``It must withdraw or
we will force the Iranians to withdraw and suffer more casualties.''
   In addition to territorial losses, Iran suffered a psychological
blow in the latest round of attacks on cities from Feb. 29 to April
21 of this year, in which hundreds of civilians were killed on both
sides. Up to half Tehran's 6 million people fled to the countryside
to escape Iraqi missiles.
   Iraq fired nearly 200 missiles into Tehran and other cities
during the exchange, three times the number launched by Iran.

   Independent counsel James McKay concluded in a
report released today that Attorney General Edwin Meese III
probably willfully filed a false income tax return, failed to pay
taxes on time and broke a criminal conflict-of-interest law.
   But McKay said he had decided not to seek criminal charges
against the attorney general because ``there is no evidence that
Mr. Meese acted from motivation for personal gain. ... There is no
evidence that he acted out of self-interest.''
   In an 814-page report, McKay said Meese's 1985 tax return did
not declare some capital gains from the sale of securities and that
Meese did not pay income tax on his capital gains from those sales
when he filed the return.
   ``A trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a reasonable
doubt that Mr. Meese violated'' a section of the Internal Revenue
Code by filing ``a materially false tax return,'' said McKay, who
added that Meese probably also violated a section of the Internal
Revenue Code for ``willfully failing to pay tax at the time
required by law.''
   Meese also probably violated a criminal conflict-of-interest law
in connection with his holdings of $14,000 in regional Bell
telephone stock, but the independent counsel who investigated Meese
for 14 months disclosed today that he had decided not to prosecute
the case.
   McKay said Meese owned the stock in the regional Bell companies
in 1985 and 1986, when he set in motion a review process that led
to a reversal of Justice Department policy. McKay also found that
Meese participated in discussions of proposed legislation to shift
regulatory responsibility for the breakup of AT&T from a federal
court and the Justice Department to the Federal Communications
Commission.
   McKay said that ``a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond
a reasonable doubt that Mr. Meese violated'' a federal
conflict-of-interest law. That law makes it a felony for a U.S.
official to participate personally and substantially in a
particular matter in which he or his spouse has a financial
interest.
   McKay told reporters this afternoon the investigation had cost
about $1.7 million as of the end of June, and he added, ``I feel
confident we have not wasted any government funds, any of the
taxpayers' money.''
   He said the decision to accuse Meese of crimes without charging
him was probably the ``toughest mental decision we had to make.''
He said he decided that charges in such matters would not have been
brought against an ordinary citizen and therefore should not be
brought against Meese. He said there was no pattern of tax
violation by Meese or his wife and Meese had not shown bad faith
and had not deliberately lied.
   President Reagan ``is pleased that after extensive scrutiny, the
independent counsel did not charge the attorney general with any
criminal wrongdoing,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``As he has said before, the president
feels Ed Meese has been an outstanding attorney general.''
   Nathan Lewin, Meese's attorney, said he views McKay's assertion
that Meese probably committed crimes as the actions of a ``hit and
run driver. It's a very cheap shot.''
   Lewin accused McKay, in a news conference after the report was
released, of reaching inappropriate conclusions and of going beyond
what ``any reasonable prosecutor would do.'' He said, however, he
was not accusing McKay of unethical conduct and considered him an
honorable man.
   As for the tax return, Meese's investment manager, W. Franklyn
Chinn, sold securities for Meese and his wife, Ursula, in May and
June 1985 and deposited the proceeds of $54,581 in the Meeses'
account.
   The Meeses realized a net capital gain of $20,706 from these
sales. They owed $3,479 in taxes, which was initially due on April
15, 1986.
   The Meeses were granted extensions for filing their return until
Oct. 15, 1986.
   A week before the Oct. 15 deadline, Meese told his accountant,
John McKean, that the securities had been sold in 1985. But Meese
did not identify the securities or tell the accountant what the
sale proceeds were or what their cost had been, facts necessary to
calculate the capital gain.
   According to McKay, Meese had not yet located or assembled that
information.
   McKean suggested to Meese, and Meese agreed, that the return be
filed by the deadline without any reference to the securities sales
and that an amended return disclosing the required information be
filed as soon as possible.
   McKay said that Meese finally filed an amended tax return on
Feb. 6 of this year declaring a capital gain on the securities
sales of $14,606 and that Meese paid the tax due on that amount
plus interest.
   McKay noted that Meese filed the amended return ``shortly after
the scheduling of the grand jury appearances for the Meeses'
accountants'' in connection with McKay's criminal investigation of
the matter.
   ``Mr. Meese had a duty to report the securities sales and to
declare his capital gains income on his tax return filed Oct. 15,
1986,'' said McKay.
   ``Because that return did not disclose any information about the
1985 securities sales, it was materially false,'' McKay declared.
   ``It incorrectly stated the income and tax due without any
notation or other reference explaining that those figures did not
include any information about the securities sales,'' said McKay's
report.
   In regard to the phone stock, McKay's report said that
``Congress has declared ... that it is a criminal offense for an
officially personally and substantially to participate in a
particular matter in which he knows he has a financial interest.''
   But McKay went on to say that Congress did not seek to limit a
prosecutor's discretion in determining whether or not a probable
violation of the law warrants actual prosecution.
   McKay said that ``there is no substantial federal interest in
prosecuting probable violations resulting from an official's
participation in matters when a similar kind of participation ...
was covered by waivers for periods both before and after the
probable violations occurred.''
   McKay added that there was ``no evidence of deliberate
circumvention of the waiver process, concealment of the financial
interest, motivation for personal gain, or effect on government
decision-making.''
   When he was White House counselor, Meese obtained a waiver from
the White House counsel's office early in the Reagan administration
allowing him to participate in telecommunications matters, despite
his stock holdings in AT&T.
   In 1987, after he had became attorney general and met with
executives of the regional Bells and participated in the
legislative initiative, Meese obtained another waiver from the
White House counsel's office. This one permitted him to approve
early in 1987 a reversal of Justice Department position concerning
the regional Bells. Meese endorsed a position urging a federal
court judge to allow the Bells to branch into new areas of business.
   The independent counsel said that an argument could be made that
prosecuting an attorney general ``would serve as a significant
deterrent'' to other high-ranking public officials.

   He said he had considered that argument and ``concluded that Mr.
Meese's particular position in government should not be the
determining factor in the prosecutive decision'' in a case in which
a prosecution is not otherwise warranted.
   McKay also disclosed that Meese's longtime friend, E. Robert
Wallach, who is under indictment for alleged racketeering in the
Wedtech scandal, facilitated Meese's refinancing of his McLean,
Va., home through the National Bank of Washington.
   The $260,000 mortgage loan appears to have been made at terms
that were customary for the bank at that time for a loan of that
size, said McKay.

   ``Circumstantial inferences may be drawn from the coincidence,
especially during the spring, summer and fall of 1895, between Mr.
Meese's acceptance of things of value from Mr. Wallach and Mr.
Meese's official acts that benefited Mr. Wallach,'' said McKay, who
noted:
   ``During that 1985 time period, while Mr. Meese had a
substantial potential liability to Mr. Wallach for legal fees,
after Mr. Wallach had arranged what was proving to be a profitable
relationship between Mr. Meese and Mr. Chinn, and while Mr. Wallach
was arranging for Mrs. Meese to secure a job paying $40,000 per
year, Mr. Meese undertook unusual official activiites to aid Mr.
Wallach's efforts to further'' a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline
project.
   The independent counsel said there is ``some evidence to support
a conclusion that Mr. Meese accepted things of value from Mr.
Wallach when he should have been sensitive to the possibility that
a part of Mr. Wallach's motivation may have been to show
appreciation for Mr. Meese's official activities that benefited Mr.
Wallach.''
   ``If Mr. Meese believed that Mr. Wallach was motivated in part
by such a consideration, a gratuities violation would have
occurred,'' said McKay.
   But the independent counsel concluded:
   ``There is no direct evidence that Mr. Meese accepted anything
of value from Mr. Wallach with the requisite state of mind for a
gratuities violation. The independent counsel has determined that
the available evidence is insufficient to conclude that such a
violation probably occurred.''
   In a printed rebuttal, Meese's lawyers said the attorney general
committed no criminal tax offense when he authorized his accountant
to file his 1985 tax return on the basis of available information.
   Meese took active steps to collect the needed information to
determine captial gains and there is no basis for concluding that
Meese acted willfully and with specific intent to violate the law,
said his lawyers, Nathan Lewin, James Rocap and Niki Kuckes.
   At one point in the report, McKay says that ``There are some
notable coincidences in the timing of Mr. Meese's acceptance of
things of value directly or indirectly from Mr. Wallach and some of
the official acts done by Mr. Meese that benefited Mr. Wallach.''
   ``The kinds of favors that Mr. Wallach did _ assisting his
long-time friend with a legal problem, suggesting an investment
adviser, and facilitating job opportunities for a family member _
are consistent with ordinary close friendship,'' said Meese's
lawyers.
   Meese's lawyers say that McKay is incorrect in suggesting that
Meese should have been more sensitive to the possibility that part
of Wallach's motivation for his actions may have been to show
appreciation for Meese's official activities.
   McKay's investigation turned up several new elements in an
incident in 1985 when Howard and Sondra Bender, head of a wealth
Washington real estate family, provided $40,000 for Meese's wife,
Ursula, to be paid by the Multiple Sclerosis Society where she had
previously worked as a volunteer. The donation coincided with
efforts by a Bender real estate partnership to renew a lucrative
lease on office space for Justice Department agencies.
   McKay revealed that Meese's friend Wallach brought Mrs. Meese's
desire for a paid job to the attention of the Benders. But McKay
said he turned up no information that Meese was aware of Bender's
interest in the building or took any role in the lease renewal.
   McKay also disclosed that as his grand jury looked into the
matter in February 1988, Bender loaned Wallach $200,000, secured by
a note and a deed of trust to property owned by Wallach, and agreed
to expand the loan to $500,000 later if an additional deed were
turned over.
   In rebuttal, Bender's attorneys said Wallach said he needed the
money for legal bills because the government had frozen his assets.
They added that the loan was disclosed to the U.S. attorney in New
York where Wallach is under indictment for trying to peddle his
influence with Meese.
   The McKay report also:
   _Concluded there was no violation of federal law in Meese's
involvement in a private proposal to build a $1 billion pipeline
for Iraq and Jordan. But mcKay's report said his investigation had
been hampered by a lack of testimony from key principles and
described Meese's action on at least one count as ``highly
unusual.''
   The investigation focused on a memorandum from Wallach that
appeared to indicate that a secret payment might be paid to
Israel's Labor Party by pipeline developers for a guarantee from
Israel not to harm the pipeline.
   The report said it was ``highly unusual'' for Meese to request
that then-National Security Adviser Robert MacFarlane meet with
Wallach over a matter that was of commercial interest to Wallach,
who had been retained by Swiss-based busnessman Bruce Rappaport to
help with the project. The pipeline as never built.
   Meese's attorneys, in their response, called the pipeline probe
a ``mammothly expensive feckless venture'' which netted nothing.
   ``This is probably the most poorly conceived, ill-founded and
wasteful use of investigative resources in the history of American
law enforcement,'' the attorneys said.
   _Said investigators had learned that Chinn had ``maintained a
`Meese' account in Hong Kong purportedly for the purpose of trading
in the Hong Kong Loco London Gold market.''
   McKay said that discovery, coupled with questions raised when it
was learned that Chinn had transfered large sums of cash overseas
through agents and foreign associates, led to an expansion of the
investigation.
   He said the probe was handicapped when Chinn and Wallach refused
to testify, asserting their 5th amendment rights.
   But in the end, McKay said he had concluded ``that while Mr.
Chinn's services to Mr. Meese may have been unusual, there is no
substantial evidence to conclude that any benefit that was accepted
in this regard by Mr. Meese from Mr. Chinn or Mr. Wallach, was an
unlawful gratuity.

   Christians and Moslem villagers battled
each other in sheep pastures in northern Lebanon. Police said 10
people died and 32 were wounded.
   In Christian east Beirut Monday, a car bomb exploded, killing
one man and wounding another, police said.
   They said a Japanese-made car rigged with 33 pounds of explosive
blew up near the main entrance to Hotel-Dieu Hospital in east
Beirut's Ashrafiyeh residential district.
   It was the ninth car bombing in Lebanon this year. Since April
23, car bombs have killed 95 people and left 303 wounded.
   Police said two people were killed in a firefight between the
Obeid Christian clan and the rival Sunni Moslem Abdel-razak family
in the town of Berqayel, about 50 miles northeast of Beirut.
   Supporters of the feuding clans fought with rifles and machine
guns in the streets of Berqayel until dawn Monday, police reported.
   In northern Lebanon, Maronite Catholics from the town of
Qoubaiyat fought the Shiite Moslem Jaafar clan in the neighboring
village of Shanbook with machine guns and grenades, leaving six
dead and 20 wounded, police said.
   Two Lebanese army soldiers from Qoubaiyat were among the dead
and three other soldiers among the wounded, police said.
   A police spokesman said a flock of sheep from Qoubaiyat Saturday
strayed into pastures claimed by the Jaafars, prompting Shiite
tribesmen to take up arms to drive off the intruding sheep,
accompanied by shepherds.
   The fighting raged through Sunday until Syrian troops set up
buffer zones between the two sides early Monday, said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Interior Minister Abdulla Rassi said about 80 Syrian troops
intervened at his request to quell the clashes in the area, about
70 miles northeast of Beirut.
   Qoubaiyat has a population of 20,000 and Shanbook has an
estimated 5,000 inhabitants.
   The 13-year-old civil war between Lebanon's Moslems and
Christians has claimed more than 130,000 lives since it broke out
in 1975.

<HEAD>Protest Erupts During Dutch Visit To Refugee Camp</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KALANDIA, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dutch foreign minister
cut short a tour of this Palestinian refugee camp Monday after
dozens of Arab youths chanting anti-Israeli slogans stoned
journalists covering the visit.
   Foreign Minister Hans Van Den Broek was in a camp clinic 200
yards from the demonstration and was not hurt.
   After his departure, dozens of troops fired rubber bullets to
disperse the youths, who raised outlawed Palestinian flags and
pictures of PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
   The Kalandia camp is located about six miles north of Jerusalem.
   In another development, a 17-year-old Arab from the West Bank
village of Beit Sahour died Monday after a large brick fell on his
head as he passed by an army post, hospital officials said.
   Arab reporters quoted witnesses as saying a soldier threw the
brick at Admon Elias Hilal. Army officials denied the charges,
saying an investigation showed part of the roof's guardrail
collapsed and a brick fell to the ground.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli troops shot and wounded
three Palestinians in separate clashes, hospital officials said.
   A 29-year-old Arab died at Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital of a
bullet wound sustained in a July 10 clash with troops.
   His death brought to 224 the number of Palestinians killed since
the Dec. 8 start of the Arab uprising in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, according to United Nations figures. Four Israelis have also
died.
   Palestinians throughout the occupied lands closed down shops and
deserted the streets to observe a general strike in solidarity with
Arabs held in an Israeli prison.
   Van den Broek, who is accompanying Dutch Prime Minister Ruud
Lubbers, told residents of the Kalandia camp that he and Lubbers
have urged Israel to ``abide by the rule of international law when
maintaining law in the territories.''
   Israeli measures in quelling the uprising have included house
demolitions and deportations.
   The mother of two camp residents ordered deported by Israel
asked van den Broek to intervene on her sons' behalf. The minister
said he would look into the matter.
   During the tour of the camp, van den Broek was thronged by
residents, some of whom chanted ``PLO, Israel No!'' A teen-ager,
his face masked with a red checkered Arab headdress, stood on a
rooftop and held a picture of Arafat.
   Earlier Monday, van den Broek met with 14 Palestinian officials
who called on the Netherlands to recognize the PLO and take a firm
stand against what they described as Israeli repression.
   Among the officials were newspaper editor Hanna Siniora, lawyer
Faez Abu Rahmeh and journalist Faisal Husseini, all supporters of
the PLO.
   After the meeting, van den Broek said Dutch officials would use
their close relations with Israel to ``further the peace process
and also show our Israeli friends how we feel about the Palestinian
people.''
   He did not elaborate, but in Kalandia, van den Broek said that
Palestinians have a right to self-determination and that Israel has
a right to exist.
   However, van den Broek later he was skeptical any breakthroughs
could be achieved in the stalled Middle East peace process before
Israel's elections in November.
   Lubbers, who has criticized what he termed Israel's ``harsh
measures'' in quelling the uprising, reiterated his criticism
Monday in talks with Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   Lubbers later met with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
who said the two men clashed verbally over how to solve the
Arab-Israeli conflict.

   Temperatures sizzling to record highs are giving people
inspiration in the effort to keep comfortable, with solutions
ranging from old-fashioned ice cream and shade trees to
new-fashioned shopping malls.
   ``I'm going from tree to tree to find shade,'' said Donna Gober,
27, of Dallas, where Sunday's temperature was 100 and the thermal
heat index, a combination of temperature and humidity, reached 108.
   ``It was too hot to do anything,'' said Jennifer Swann, 13, of
Crownsville, Md., as she and two friends sat in air-conditioned
comfort at Annapolis Mall.
   ``It's sticky. Your clothes stick to you. It's gross,'' said her
friend, Amy Stem, who said her parents don't believe in
air-conditioning at home.
   At the other extreme were residents of San Francisco, who are
accustomed to foggy pea-soup weather and reveled in heat that
pushed the temperature to an all-time high Sunday of 103 degrees.
   ``We want more! We can take it!'' proclaimed Dennis Sherry, who
sat on the Marina Green recreation area with several pals. ``I
don't believe it was 103. We can stand it hotter! More!''
   ``It's outrageous, really crazy. Business is out the door,''
said Nancy Gumalinski, an ice cream saleswoman at a shop in San
Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood.
   The heat was the biggest enemy at Checotah, Okla., in the Second
Battle of Honey Springs, a Civil War battle. But in spite of the
100-degree heat Sunday, no casualties were reported among the
nearly 300 re-enactors and a crowd of up to 15,000.
   Police and volunteers in Dallas have distributed about 50
electric fans to families without air conditioning in poor
neighborhoods. ``It would be a health hazard, if we didn't,'' said
police Sgt. Dan Bell. ``We have about 230 more we plan to give
away.''
   Robert Noble, 49, who has been living on the Dallas streets for
a month, said the heat is merciless on the homeless, who must stay
outside until shelters open at night. ``Some people have a little
money for beer,'' Noble said. ``But the water will keep me from
fainting.''
   Long spells of high temperatures make concrete highways and
streets expand, and they buckle and shatter when they run out of
room. Indianapolis' street maintenance division estimates 30
blow-ups along city streets so far this summer, not counting
sidewalks.
   ``They're going spastic trying to get to these blow-ups,'' said
Jack Smith, assistant manager for the street maintenance divison.
``The number is absolutely higher than in previous years. We've had
many, many blow-ups because of this heat.''
   ``With concrete, it has got to go someplace. It's going to go up
or down,'' he said. ``They just happen. Boom!''
   Los Angeles suffered under a double whammy of heat and smog
Monday, but many people continued their pursuit of outdoor pleasure
anyway.
   ``It makes it hard to breathe,'' said Jesse Mellor, 36, a
hospital counselor out for a 6-mile jaunt despite the smog. ``I
notice my times go down. I run five miles and it feels like I've
run 10.''
   Golfers appeared undeterred by heat or smog on the courses in
Griffith Park.
   ``You know golfers,'' said actor Mitchell Laurence, 38, a former
regular on ``Not Necessarily the News,'' as he waited to tee off.
``You play in all kinds of weather. You play when it's wet, you
play in the cold, you play in heat, you play in smog.''

<HEAD>Government Orders Closure Of Chemical Plant After Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday ordered the closure of a
pesticide plant that exploded and spewed toxic smoke over a coastal
resort in the central region of Tuscany, and hundreds of people
sought treatment at hospitals.
   The explosion Sunday in the plant's 13,000-gallon tank, which
contained liquid hydrocarbon mixed with a pesticide, spread the
smoke over the town of Massa, on the northwest coast. Thousands of
panicked residents evacuated.
   The government said the closure of Farmoplant, a subsidiary of
the giant Montedison chemical group, was taken as a precaution
while the cause of the accident is under investigation. The plant
employs 400 workers.
   Gianni Stea, director of Farmoplant, said a failure of the
tank's cooling system caused the explosion.
   Health authorities said leakage from the explosion killed fish
in a nearby stream and warned residents against eating fruit and
vegetables before experts check pollution levels around the plant.
   The Civil Defense Ministry said about 200 people were admitted
to hospitals in Massa and nearby towns with complaints of stomach
pains and burning eyes and throat.
   The plant, which is located in a residential area, has had
several toxic leaks in the past few years, according to the
environmentalist Green Party.
   In a non-binding referendum in October, 70 percent of the town's
residents voted for its closure.

   A grocer handed out free ice,
utility crews worked to restore power and the mayor of this
Missiouri River city on Monday applauded cleanup efforts from a
devastating tornado.
   ``It's been unbelievable. The city really has done a tremendous
job,'' said Mayor Tom Hanafan.
   The violent storm that spawned at least four tornadoes struck
the Omaha, Neb., metropolitan area Friday afternoon before
hopscotching across the river into Council Bluffs. The most severe
damage was in Council Bluffs, and officials have estimated as many
as 10,000 homes received some damage.
   ``We're evaluating damage to city streets, curbs, buildings,
that type of thing,'' Hanafan said. ``We're in the process of
tearing down two buildings that suffered structural damage. The
walls were swaying.
   ``Everybody is doing something.''
   Most of the 94 people hurt Friday were treated for minor
injuries at area hospitals. A few remained hospitalized Monday, one
in serious condition.
   Gov. Terry Branstad declared Pottawattamie County a disaster
area Sunday after touring the 700-square-block area damaged by
winds clocked at 92 mph.
   ``I'm surprised that with this much damage there weren't any
fatalities or serious injuries,'' Branstad said. ``To see that kind
of devastation and not have more personal injuries or more serious
injuries, I think we can just count our blessings.''
   Lowell Hager, manager-owner of Broadway Food Land, was
distributing free ice Monday to customers without power.
   ``Our supplier sent in a 48-foot trailer full of ice,'' he said.
``I'm presently giving that away to any customer who needs it with
one bag per family.''
   Hanafan said utility crews were working to restore power by
Wednesday.
   Losses to residences and commercial buildings totaled $16.5
million, Hanafan said. Insurance adjusters projected overall damage
would reach $20 million to $25 million.
   The mayor and others have said that as many as 10,000 homes were
damaged in the storm. That estimates includes homes that were
destroyed as well as those that suffered slight damage.
   Representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
regional office in Kansas City were en route to Council Bluffs on
Monday, and were to begin assessing damage Tuesday, said regional
director Jerry Overstreet.
   Omaha was nearly back to normal Monday, with power restored to
all neighborhoods.
   ``We have no estimate at all of damage to the city or the cost
of the cleanup,'' said Kevin Collison, press aide for Mayor Walt.
``We probably won't have until this is all cleaned up. We seem to
be in really good shape.''
   Hanafan said a 10 p.m. curfew would remain in effect for those
areas without power. The Iowa National Guard was called in after
Friday's storm to help prevent looting.

   Oscar-winning actress Olympia Dukakis you'd
expect. But Wonder Woman?
   Indeed, both will grace the podium at the Democratic National
Convention this week, just two members of the host of performing
artists whose voices will leaven the political proceedings.
   Starting with humorist Garrison Keillor's recitation of the
Pledge of Allegiance and ending with closing music by gospel singer
Jennifer Holliday, the convention is so star-studded it almost
threatens to be entertaining.
   Celebrities in the lineup include opera star Sherrill Milnes
singing the national anthem, the Rev. Billy Graham delivering an
invocation and Whitney Phipps, who performed a hymn at the 1984
convention, doing a closing number.
   And that's just Tuesday night.
   Wednesday it will be young Louisiana singer Kenneth Mack with
the anthem and music by Dionne Warwick to close the session.
Thursday, Lynda Carter _ formerly TV's Wonder Woman _ sings the
anthem and Ms. Holliday does the closing.
   Entertainment also will come Thursday from two members of Gov.
Michael Dukakis' clan. Cousin Olympia Dukakis, Oscar winner as best
supporting actress in the film ``Moonstruck,'' will introduce the
governor. Harry Ellis Dickson, his father-in-law and former
associate conductor of the Boston Pops, will conduct the ``Fanfare
for Michael Dukakis'' by composer John Williams, who also is the
Pops' conductor.
   Do these seasoned performers take their tasks seriously? Ask
Keillor, who was observed at the podium hours in advance of his
performance Monday night, practicing his remarks from memory for
the benefit of the stage managers.
   Keillor, who safely can be described as a better humorist than
he is a singer, drew the attention of a small horde of technicians
and security personnel as he practiced the anthem. He dispelled the
mystery of how he would handle the high notes by gracefully going
low when they rose beyond his range.
   He even practiced the pledge.

<HEAD>Independent Counsel Says Meese Probably Broke Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III probably
broke two tax laws and violated a criminal conflict-of-interest
statute, but won't be charged with a crime, independent counsel
James McKay concluded in an 814-page report unveiled to the public
on Monday.
   An attorney for Meese, Nathan Lewin, called the assertions ``a
very cheap shot.''
   In a report which concluded his 14-month investigation, McKay
wrote that ``A trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Meese violated'' a section of the
Internal Revenue Code by filing ``a materially false tax return.''
McKay added that Meese probably also violated a section of the
Internal Revenue Code for ``willfully failing to pay tax at the
time required by law.''
   Meese announced July 5 that he will step down as attorney
general later this month or in early August. He said then that
McKay's report, which he had not read at the time, ``completely
vindicated'' him. The report originally was filed under seal that
day with a three-judge court.
   Richard Thornburgh, named by President Reagan to succeed Meese,
has said he will pursue any evidence against Meese wherever it may
lead.
   McKay said that the Meeses' failed to report a net capital gain
of $20,706 on the sale of $54,581 in securities in 1985.
   McKay noted that Meese finally filed an amended return on Feb. 6
of this year, ``shortly after the scheduling of the grand jury
appearances for the Meeses' accountants'' in connection with
McKay's criminal investigation of the matter.
   At that time, the Meeses paid $2,875 in overdue federal tax
payments and interest with the amended return, declaring a capital
gain on the securities sales of $14,606. McKay said, however, that
Meese's accountants had made an error in calculating the basis of
AT&T stock sold in 1985, under which some $1,000 in additional tax
was due the government on an added $6,000 in capital gains.
   The proceeds from the 1985 sales were invested for the Meeses'
by the attorney general's financial manager, W. Franklyn Chinn, who
is currently under indictment for alleged racketeering in the
Wedtech scandal. Meese had been referred to Chinn by Meese's
longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach, who also figures prominently in
the report.
   ``Mr. Meese had a duty to report the securities sales and to
declare his capital gains income on his tax return filed Oct. 15,
1986,'' said McKay.
   ``Because that return did not disclose any information about the
1985 securities sales, it was materially false,'' McKay declared.
   McKay also disclosed that Wallach, who is under indictment for
alleged racketeering in the Wedtech scandal, facilitated two loans
to Meese totalling $340,000.
   The independent counsel examined the transactions in trying to
determine whether Meese had accepted a bribe or a gratuity. At
Wallach's behest, Meese intervened on behalf of the Wedtech Corp.
in 1981, resulting ultimately in the defense contractor being
awarded a $32 million contract. Meese also assisted Wallach in
connection with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project, setting up
a meeting between the San Francisco lawyer and then-National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.
   Lewin said he views McKay's assertion that Meese probably
committed crimes as the actions of a ``hit and run driver. It's a
very cheap shot.''
   Lewin accused McKay, in a news conference after the report was
released, of reaching inappropriate conclusions and of going beyond
what ``any reasonable prosecutor would do.''
   President Reagan ``is pleased that after extensive scrutiny, the
independent counsel did not charge the attorney general with any
criminal wrongdoing,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``As he has said before, the president
feels Ed Meese has been an outstanding attorney general.''
   McKay's report noted that ``Under the policies of the Internal
Revenue Service and the Department of Justice, a taxpayer's efforts
to bring himself into compliance with his obligations before an
investigation of his affairs are taken into account in determining
whether to bring criminal charges.''
   Meese probably violated the conflict-of-interest law in
connection with his holdings of $14,000 in regional Bell telephone
stock, McKay said.
   McKay said Meese owned the stock in the regional Bell companies
in 1985 and 1986, when he set in motion a review process that led
to a reversal of Justice Department policy. McKay also found that
Meese participated in discussions of proposed legislation to shift
regulatory responsibility for the breakup of AT&T from a federal
court and the Justice Department to the Federal Communications
Commission.
   McKay said that ``a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond
a reasonable doubt that Mr. Meese violated'' a federal
conflict-of-interest law. That law makes it a felony for a U.S.
official to participate personally and substantially in a
particular matter in which he or his spouse has a financial
interest.
   McKay said he had decided not to seek criminal charges against
the attorney general because ``there is no evidence that Mr. Meese
acted from motivation for personal gain. ... There is no evidence
that he acted out of self-interest.''

   President Reagan has chosen the
name ``Freedom'' for the permanently manned space station being
jointly developed by the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan,
his spokesman said Monday.
   ``The name `Freedom' was recommended by a team of NASA
representatives and international partners,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   ``The yearning for freedom is a basic human emotion, and freedom
of the individual is a value shared by all nations that will work
together to build and use the space station,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the name ``Freedom'' is tied to Reagan's earliest
statements about the space station program.
   ``When the president announced his decision to build a space
station in his January 1984 State of the Union address, he noted
that he was inviting our friends and allies to join us so `we can
strengthen peace, build prosperity and expand freedom for all who
share our goals,''' Fitzwater said.
   The space station will consist of three laboratory modules _ one
each from the United States, Europe and Japan _ and a habitat
module that will accommodate a full-time crew of eight. Canada will
provide a mobile servicing center to help assemble and maintain the
manned base.
   The space station is to be launched aboard the space shuttle and
assembled in orbit beginning in 1995. It will provide a versatile
research laboratory for conducting science, developing new
technologies, exploring the solar system and stimulating private
business investment in space, the White House statement said.

   The independent counsel said that an argument could be made that
prosecuting an attorney general ``would serve as a significant
deterrent'' to other high-ranking public officials.
   He said he had considered that argument and ``concluded that Mr.
Meese's particular position in government should not be the
determining factor in the prosecutive decision'' in a case in which
a prosecution is not otherwise warranted.
   In connection with his examination of whether Meese accepted
bribes or gratuities from Wallach, McKay found that in September
1983 the San Francisco lawyer introduced Meese to Jeffrey Cohen,
board chairman of the National Bank of Commerce in Washington.
   ``The purpose of that introduction was to enable Mr. Meese to
obtain immediately an $80,000 loan from Mr. Cohen's bank,'' said
McKay.
   On the same day he filed a loan application, Meese received an
unsecured personal loan from the bank for $80,000, with the
understanding it would be converted to a secured loan as soon as
necessary paperwork was completed.
   ``Although Mr. Wallach's efforts to facilitate the loan was a
thing of value accepted by Mr. Meese, the loan itself appears to
have been made on terms, including a rate of interest, customary
for such loans by the bank at that time,'' said McKay.
   The independent counsel also disclosed that Wallach facilitated
Meese's refinancing of his McLean, Va., home through the National
Bank of Washington.
   The $260,000 mortgage loan appears to have been made at terms
that were customary for the bank at that time for a loan of that
size, said McKay.
   ``Circumstantial inferences may be drawn from the coincidence,
especially during the spring, summer and fall of 1895, between Mr.
Meese's acceptance of things of value from Mr. Wallach and Mr.
Meese's official acts that benefited Mr. Wallach,'' said McKay, who
noted:
   ``During that 1985 time period, while Mr. Meese had a
substantial potential liability to Mr. Wallach for legal fees,
after Mr. Wallach had arranged what was proving to be a profitable
relationship between Mr. Meese and Mr. Chinn, and while Mr. Wallach
was arranging for Mrs. Meese to secure a job paying $40,000 per
year, Mr. Meese undertook unusual official activiites to aid Mr.
Wallach's efforts to further'' a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline
project.
   But the independent counsel concluded:
   ``There is no direct evidence that Mr. Meese accepted anything
of value from Mr. Wallach with the requisite state of mind for a
gratuities violation. The independent counsel has determined that
the available evidence is insufficient to conclude that such a
violation probably occurred.''
   McKay's investigation turned up several new elements in an
incident in 1985 when Howard and Sondra Bender, head of a wealth
Washington real estate family, provided $40,000 for Meese's wife,
Ursula, to be paid by the Multiple Sclerosis Society, where she had
previously worked as a volunteer. The donation coincided with
efforts by a Bender real estate partnership to renew a lucrative
lease on office space for Justice Department agencies.
   McKay revealed that Meese's friend Wallach brought Mrs. Meese's
desire for a paid job to the attention of the Benders. But McKay
said he turned up no information that Meese was aware of Bender's
interest in the building or took any role in the lease renewal.
   McKay also:
   _Disclosed that about the time his grand jury looked into the
matter in February 1988, Bender loaned Wallach $200,000, secured by
a note and a deed of trust to property owned by Wallach, and agreed
to expand the loan to $500,000 later if an additional deed were
turned over.
   _Concluded there was no violation of federal law in Meese's
involvement in a private proposal to build a $1 billion pipeline
for Iraq and Jordan. But McKay's report said his investigation had
been hampered by a lack of testimony from key principles and
described Meese's action on at least one count as ``highly
unusual.''

<TEXT>
   Amid swarming delegates, American flags and
colorful banners sits a high-tech newcomer to the Democratic
National Convention floor, poised to ensure the smoothest voting
process ever.
   Computerized voting machines, friendly to even the most fearful
user, are strategically placed on The Omni floor and ready to tally
delegation votes in a matter of seconds.
   Democrats say the aim is to maintain a wrinkle-free convention
and, most importantly, to save time.
   ``We have only two hours of prime time now to work with,'' says
Tony Shorris, Democratic National Committee spokesman. ``And to
vote in the traditional way takes about 35 minutes.''
   Under the system custom-tailored by AT&T for the convention,
state delegation chairmen need only touch a soft, light-sensitive
screen to record votes on platform and convention rules issues.
Centralized computers tally the votes and display totals on a huge
screen in the hall.
   Each state has its own terminal and a pre-programmed number of
votes. If the vote total recorded exceeds the number allocated, the
process is interrupted until the delegation chairman properly
tallies his state's votes.
   The overall effect is a match to the futuristic image sought by
the party.
   ``Hey, we're in a high-tech society,'' says Rhode Island state
chairman Joe Paolino. ``Mike Dukakis is high-tech. It's something
that goes along with it.''
   ``The whole theme is management,'' says Shorris. ``The
management of the convention and the management of the country.
Part of management is the use of technology.''
   Only in the cases of voting for presidential and vice
presidential nominees will progress bow to tradition. Those votes
will be handled via roll call on Wednesday and Thursday nights.
   ``I'm glad the roll call is going to be traditional,'' says
Paolino. ``We need that kind of tradition.''
   While the system has won plenty of converts among top Democratic
circles, there remain some who find the new system daunting.
   Delaware state chairman Samuel Shipley, a two-convention
veteran, says he's afraid he'll ``be in trouble if I touch a
button'' and is relying on another member of his delegation to man
the voting terminal.
   ``Many of us aren't mechanically inclined,'' says Shipley. ``It
would take me a week to learn to use the thing.''

<HEAD>Study: Sound Test for High-Risk Unborn May be Damaging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A device used to test fetuses during
high-risk pregnancies produces sound in the womb as intense as a
jet and may be harmful, University of Florida researchers say.
   In studies conducted on sheep, the electronic testing device _
also used medically as an artificial larynx or voice box _ produced
sound levels in the uterus as high as 135 decibels, the approximate
noise level of a jet airliner taking off or a machine gun firing at
close range.
   The findings do not apply to ultrasound devices routinely used
during normal pregnancies, which use a different range of
frequencies, said Dr. Robert Abrams, a research professor in the
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
   Abrams says it is not known how much of the artificial larnynx
sound the fetus hears.
   But he writes in the July issue of the American Journal of
Obstetrics and Gynecology that ``caution is recommended in
administering the sound test until the effects of high noise levels
on the fetus are better understood.''
   The fetal response test has become a popular method for
monitoring fetal health during high-risk pregnancies. It involves
holding the device against the mother's abdomen. The doctor can
tell if the fetus is alive and well if it responds to the loud
buzzing.
   ``Now that we have an idea of the volume of sound produced in
the womb by the electronic larynx, it's easy to understand why the
human fetus reacts as it does,'' Abrams said.
   ``If the unborn child is healthy, the test normally causes an
accelerated heart rate, a blink-startle response and extreme body
movements that persist for several minutes after the short
stimulus,'' he said.
   The device's potential hazards surfaced during studies with
sheep designed to find out how much sound outside the womb actually
reaches the fetus.
   Researchers surgically implanted a special microphone near the
ear of the fetuses in five ewes. The device can pick up external
sounds while suspended in the amniotic fluid encasing the embryo.
   Researchers then exposed the ewes to a variety of sounds at
different frequencies and volumes, and recorded the difference
between the sounds outside and inside the womb.

<TEXT>
   The state Court of Appeals has agreed to hear
subway shooter Bernhard Goetz's apppeal of his weapons possession
conviction, an attorney said Monday.
   Goetz had been scheduled to be resentenced Monday but that
proceeding was postponed pending the higher court action.
   Goetz's attorney, Mark Baker, said Court of Appeals Judge Joseph
W. Bellacosa agreed to hear the appeal before Aug. 1.
   The re-sentencing was necessary because a Manhattan appeals
court ruled last month that Goetz's original sentence was illegal.
   Goetz, 40, was convicted last summer of third-degree illegal
possession of a gun in the December 1984 shooting of four
teen-agers aboard a subway train.
   Goetz said he shot the youths because he believed they were
trying to rob him. They claimed they were panhandling.
   Goetz was sentenced in October to six months in jail, a $5,000
fine, 280 hours of community service, five years probation and
psychiatric counseling.
   The appeals court let everything except the jail term stand,
ruling that if Judge Stephen Crane was going to give Goetz an
indeterminate sentence, it had to be one-to-three years, not six
months. Or, it said, if he was going to sentence him under the
state's gun control law it had to be a definite one year term,
without probation.
   Goetz's lawyers have been fighting for the indeterminate
sentence because due to a quirk in the law, if given a year, he
would only have to serve two months.
   Baker reset sentencing for Aug. 22.

   ``He has been an integral part of the president's economic team,
playing an important role in many major issues, including the trade

said of Crippen.
   Baker resigned at the end of June to return to Tennessee.
   Asked if Crippen's resignation signaled the start of an exodus

<HEAD>Managers Involved in Chemical Scandal Jailed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven people were sentenced in Bucharest
to terms ranging from 11 to 18 years in prison for involvement in a
high-level chemical storage scandal, the state Romanian news agency
Agerpres reported Monday.
   Among those jailed was a representative of a Liechtenstein firm.
   The scandal, first publicized last month, led to the dismissal
of six senior government officials including the minister of trade,
the head of the state planning office and the head of the general
customs directorate.
   Agerpres said the verdict was handed down Saturday at the end of
a two-day trial at the Bucharest city court. It said the seven were
found guilty of ``grave abuses and violations.''
   The news agency said more than 4,000 tons of chemical and
petrochemical wastes that were ``highly noxious for the
population's health and the environment'' had entered the country
illegally.
   The scandal involves the Kimika company of Liechtenstein which
was accused of storing the chemical industrial waste in the free
port of Sulina on Romania's Black Sea coast.
   The Romanian foreign trade enterprise Chimica reportedly
concluded a contract with the Liecthenstein-based firm for using
the chemicals in Romania.
   According to Agerpres, the harshest sentence of 18 years in
prison was handed down to Hugo Weinstein, the Kimika
representative. Agerpres said the court concluded that Weinstein
had received ``a considerable amount of foreign currency from the
foreign firm to conclude the contracts.''
   It was not clear from the Agerpres report whether Weinstein was
a Liechtenstein citizen and whether he was at the trial. Efforts to
reach officials in Bucharest for comment on the report proved
unavailing.
   The news agency said two former managers of the Sulina port,
Dumitru Gavanescu and Silviu Nistor, each was given 11 years and a
third Sulina ex-manager, Mihai Micu, drew 13 years.
   Two ex-managers of the Romanian foreign trade enterprise
Chimica, Ioan Tetu and Ion Rupedeal, each was sentenced to 12
years. Virgil Popescu, also of Chimica, drew 14 years.
   Agerpres said the court concluded that the seven ``committed
highly serious crimes by flagrantly violating the legal norms that
forbid the bringing-in of dangerous or harmful commodities apt to
place public health and the environment in jeapordy.''
   It said the defendents can appeal.
   The news agency said ``negative consequences of the abusive and
illegal acts'' were prevented by ``efficient intervention of the
state bodies.''

   Now, wherever you are, proceedings of the
Democratic National Convention are only a phone call away at
1-900-909-DUKE.
   Uninterrupted convention coverage is available at a cost of $2
for the first minute and 35 cents for each minute after that, on a
national 900 telephone number.
   ``We don't expect that anybody is going to use this as their
mainstay of convention coverage, but if the network you're watching
breaks away for a beer commercial while your congressman is
speaking and you want to hear that, we offer you a place where you
can get it,'' said Brad Woodward, president of Elliott
Communications, the Washington-based information firm behind the
number.
   Woodward described himself in an interview Monday as ``a former
Democratic political hack.'' He worked in the Carter White House
and on both Carter campaigns.
   ``It just happened my company was moving in the direction of
national 900 service and this ws with astronauts and NASA press
briefings.
   ``Dial Duke'' callers will hear convention proceedings live from
the podium. An announcer will identify speakers and place events in
context.
   ``We're giving you what ABC, NBC and CBS won't _ everything,''
Woodward said in a statement.
   The service began at 7 a.m. Monday and will operate 24 hours
daily through the end of the convention. Between sessions, a
recorded schedule of convention events can be heard.
   The firm plans to offer next month's Republican convention by
phone as well.
   The number? Tentatively, it's 1-900-909-BUSH.

General Edwin Meese III.

<BYLINE>1985 TAXES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The independent counsel has determined from the available
evidence that a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Meese violated'' federal law ``by
wilfully filing a materially false tax return and that Mr. Meese
violated'' federal law ``by wilfully failing to pay tax at the time
required by law.''
   McKay said he wasn't recommending prosecution, in part, because
``Mr. Meese's actions were a one-time failure to comply in full
with his tax obligation; they were not part of a pattern of
disobedience to the tax laws.''
   ``Based on the independent counsel's careful review of Mr.
Meese's tax returns from 1981 through 1986, Mr. Meese appears in
all other respects to have complied with his tax obligations. There
is certainly no rule of law, nor should there be, that excuses an
isolated violation of the tax laws. However, the absence of a
pattern of noncompliance is a factor that weighs heavily in the
taxpayer's favor in the determination whether criminal penalties
... are the preferred remedy for offenses involving one item, or
one closely related group of items, on one year's tax returns.''

   ``During the period investigated by the independent counsel, Mr.
Meese preformed several official acts that benefited Mr. Wallach.
These included acts that assisted Wedtech and acts in furtherance
of the Aqaba pipeline project.''
   ``Mr. Meese's official acts that benefited Mr. Wallach began
with his actions that assisted Welbilt(Wedtech) when he was
counselor to the president. In 1981 and 1982, Mr. Meese facilitated
Welbilt's efforts to obtain a contract to manufacture small engines
for the Army.''
   ``In 1985, Mr. Meese took actions that substantially assisted
Mr. Wallach and others in connection with the proposed Aqaba
pipeline project.''
   But he concluded that ``The independent counsel has determined
that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Mr. Meese
committed any such offense'' under bribery and anti-gratuity laws.
The report notes Meese admitted helping Wallach and Wedtech, the
firm he represented. But it adds ``there is no substantial evidence
that Mr. Meese was motivated to take his actions by any
consideration other than his friendship for Mr. Wallach. The
evidence does not establish that he was even aware at that time of
the nature or extent of Mr. Wallach's prospective financial
interest in the success of Wedtech.''

   If Bill Ashworth tells you he lives in a
cave, believe him.
   Ashworth is the groundskeeper for a five-bedroom home inside a
limestone cave in the Ozarks in north Arkansas. The home was built
by Denver businessman John Hay, who made his fortune selling tea
and bought 240 acres around the Beckham Creek Cave about five years
ago.
   The home features cascading fountains, a black-and-white-tiled,
``Fred Astaire room'' and multicolored lighting, said Ashworth.
   Hay has been trying to sell the home for $3.3 million for the
past year, but so far there have been no takers. ``It's been there
for 250 million years, and it isn't going anywhere,'' Hay said.
   The cave, constructed to allow Hay to ride out a nuclear storm,
is equipped with 200 geiger counters, a truck load of
nitrogen-packed dried food and a hydroelectric generator. A real
estate brochure says the home was ``specifically designed to
withstand a nuclear war and provide maximum protection against
radiation, fallout and nuclear winter.
   Ashworth, who has lived in the cave since 1983 and has heard
more than one Fred Flintstone joke, said the cave has some unique
attributes. It's the perfect escape from summertime heat, at a
naturally cool year-round temperature of 64 degrees. It induces
hibernation-quality sleep. And the moisture is good for your skin.
   But there are drawbacks. It's dark. There's no TV reception. And
``it tends to get kind of damp in the spring,'' Hay said.

   By day he puts away murderers, but he
spends his nights with the Jazz Butcher, the Primitives and the Men
They Couldn't Hang.
   And Deputy District Attorney Pat Geary, a 14-year veteran with
Orange County's homicide unit, is ready for a change.
   An avid modern music aficionado, Geary is quitting his job and
moving to Scotland to open a New Wave record store.
   Geary, 39, who also owns a record shop in Irvine, claims he's
burned out on the legal profession after working on 200 jury
trials, including four death penalty cases. He sold his house and
next week leaves for Glasgow, Scotland.
   The prosecutor admits he's obsessed with music. He says he
prefers up-to-the-minute British pop, which is rarely played on
American radio. He opened his radio store after years of collecting
hard-to-find records.
   ``We sell more Jazz Butcher than Bruce Springsteen and are
probably the only store in America that would say that,'' said
Geary.
   Much of his music stock, which includes the Primitives and the
Men They Couldn't Hang, comes directly from London.
   ``It's really fun to turn people on to something different,''he
said. ``So many good records just die a quick death.''

   Starting Oct. 1, doctors at military hospitals
may not perform abortions unless the life of the mother is in
danger, even if the patient pays for the operation, according to a
memorandum obtained Monday.
   The June 21 memo, signed by Dr. William Mayer, assistant defense
secretary for health affairs, ended the practice under which for
the past nine years doctors have been able to perform so-called
``pre-paid abortions'' at ``military medical treatment facilities
in certain countries in which quality medical care may not be
locally available.''
   Doctors have been barred since 1979 from performing abortions
paid for by the government unless the life of the mother is
endangered.
   Mayer's memo said that ``the informal practice of performing
so-called `pre-paid' abortions in very limited circumstances does
not violate the legal prohibition.''
   But the memo changed the policy, noting that ``it might suggest
insensitivity to the spirit of the congressionally enacted policy
of withholding government involvement in the provision of
abortions.''
   ``The policy is that the performance of pre-paid abortions in
military treatment faclities is not authorized ... effective Oct.
1, 1988,'' the memo said.
   The number of abortions performed in military facilities dropped
sharply in 1980 after Congress passed laws barring the expenditure
of federal funds for unrestricted abortions, according a Pentagon
audit released last November.
   The number dropped from 10,829 in 1977 and 9,800 in 1978 to 304
in 1979 and 88 in 1980. In 1985, the most recent year for which
figures were available, the number was 48.

<HEAD>Drought Has Mixed Impact on Commercial Vegetable Yields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The total acreage of commercial vegetables for
harvest this summer is up from a year ago, but heat and drought are
taking a toll of some of the crop yields, including peas grown for
freezing and canning, an Agriculture Department report said Monday.
   Prospective acreage for seven fresh market vegetables was
estimated at 272,100 acres, down fractionally from 272,790 a year
ago, the report said. Carrots and sweet corn declined, while other
crops increased. Those included broccoli, cauliflower, celery,
lettuce and tomatoes.
   The total for five major vegetables for processing was 1.35
million acres under contract to processors, a 2 percent increase
from 1987. Increases were reported for snap beans, cucumbers for
pickles, and tomatoes, but there are fewer acres of sweet corn and
green peas.
   Drought and heat have stressed a number of the crops that have
not been irrigated, the report said.
   For example, in the category of sweet corn for fresh market
sale, the report said that drought and heat have hurt the crop in
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. In California,
however, sweet corn ``has made good progress'' after being ``slowed
somewhat by unseasonably cool weather.''
   In New Jersey, the tomato crop declined due to drought, and
``yields will be affected severely if the dry weather continues.''
   Looking at processing vegetables _ the canned and frozen kind
that consumer will see at stores next winter _ the report said hot,
dry weather has hurt yields of cucumbers used for making pickles
and ``there is increased interest this year in fall planted
cucumbers'' for processing.
   ``Production of green peas for processing is down 32 percent
from last year, based on reports from processors,'' the report
said. ``Hot, dry weather has reduced the crop expectation to
299,000 tons, compared with 437,000 tons last year and nearly
415,000 tons the year before.''
   Drought in the north-central states has cut the pea crop
drastically, the report said.
   ``Minnesota yields dropped 45 percent as heat during bloom and
filling devastated the crop,'' the report said. ``Wisconsin
processors report yields at half last year's level. Atlantic Coast
states held good moisture supplies during the spring and are
harvesting generally better (pea) crops than last year.''

<TEXT>
   Arkansas produces more rice than
any other state, but fields could go dry in the next century
because of wasteful water use, experts said Monday.
   Oversized agricultural pumps and inadequate planning are the
problem, which could wreck Arkansas' $3 billion annual farm economy
if action isn't taken, said Ronnie Murphy, deputy state chief of
the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.
   Arkansas produced 40 percent of the nation's rice last year,
earning $422 million from 1.18 million acres, said Ewell Welch,
director of the Arkansas Farm Bureau's Rice Division.
   ``If current trends continue, there may be one-third of the
Grand Prairie by the year 2010 that just won't have water
available,'' Murphy said.
   Arkansas farmers and agriculture officials from more than a
half-dozen ``humid'' states _ those normally receiving more than 20
inches of rain a year _ are gathered this week for the National
Water Management Expo.
   Elsewhere, officials in Lexington, Ky., say the Bluegrass area
is beginning to be a burden for the Kentucky River, which has
provided water for more than 400,000 people for years.
   And the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is
investigating the summer's first water interference complaint filed
by a man who said he can't get water in his home when his neighbor
is irrigating his crops.
   Farm water woes are getting more attention from non-farmers
because of the long drought. In 26 eastern Arkansas counties
studied by the Soil Conservation Service, some were nearly a foot
below normal rainfall, although recent rain has helped, said John
MacLeod, a forecaster at the National Weather Service.
   ``I don't want to paint a picture of gloom and doom, because
there are answers and alternatives,'' such as diverting surface
water and achieving greater efficiency, Murphy said.
   One Arkansas County rice farmer who pumped 57 inches of water
got a smaller crop than a neighbor using only 36 inches.
   ``It's a matter of the farmer not putting the proper amount of
water on his crop at the proper time,'' Murphy said. ``He just
pumped too much with a regular, set schedule and his pump was too
big. This is a common problem _ they don't wait until the crop
needs water.''
   During the last four years, the level of water available to pump
from beneath the region's fertile soil has gone down by 100 feet,
Murphy said.
   In Kentucky, the river's flow has been less than 10 percent of
normal for this time of year _ as low as at any time since the 1930
drought.
   At times this summer, the water has stopped flowing over some of
the 14 Kentucky River locks and dams. Because of this, communities
along the river have instituted mandatory conservation measures.
   Mandatory conservation would be a blessing to Gerald Lewerenz,
of St. Paul, who believes his neighbor, Gary Flowers, is depleting
an aquifer used by about two dozen families. Flowers has irrigated
nightly for two months, showering 600 gallons a minute on 130 acres
of corn and soybeans.
   Lewerenz said he can't use his faucets, toilet, bathtub and
washing machine when Flowers is watering.
   ``When he's not irrigating, we never have any problems,''
Lewerenz said.
   But Flowers says the irrigation is necessary to save his crops.

   The Pentagon's investigation into the downing
of Iran Air flight 655, originally due to end on Monday, will last
at least until the end of July, the Defense Department said in an
announcement.
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty flew to the Persian Gulf on July 4,
the day after the incident, and has been there since, trying to
determine how officers aboard the USS Vincennes mistook the Iranian
A300 Airbus for an attacking F-14 fighter.
   The four-sentence announcement released on Monday said that
Fogarty ``has requested additional time to complete his
investigation. The estimated completion time is the end of July.''
   ``After he has reviewed all the testimony and exhibits and
prepared his findings of fact, conclusions and recommendations,''
he will send the results to the commander of American forces in the
Persian Gulf, Gen. George B. Crist, who is based at U.S. Central
Command headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base, in Tampa, Fla.
   Crist will review the report, then forward it to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and then it will go to Secretary of Defense Frank
C. Carlucci.
   Navy officers said last week it was unlikely that Fogarty could
complete the report by Monday, and predicted that an unclassified
version would not be released until early or mid-August.
   Pentagon officials said that the version of the report released
to the public will be ``scrubbed'' of sensitive information
relating to the Aegis radar and tracking system aboard the
Vincennes.

<HEAD>Air Force Challenges Proposed Fine for Radioactive Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is challenging a proposed fine
of $102,500 for alleged violations associated with a 1986 spill of
radioactive powder at an Ohio military base, officials said Monday.
   The fine was proposed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last
month for what the agency said was willful failure to report the
spill at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton within 24
hours and for the internal exposure of an individual to the powder.
   ``The Air Force denies that it violated any of the NRC
regulations in the handling of this matter,'' said the Air Force
response to the NRC.
   Air Force spokeswoman June Green said the response cites
disagreement among NRC workers themselves as to the true nature of
the reporting requirement.
   ``We've requested that the proposed penalty be reduced or
remitted _ dropped,'' said Ms. Green.
   The ``failure to report'' violation is responsible for $100,000
of the total proposed fine. NRC officials have said it is the first
time the agency has proposed a fine against a military organization.
   No one was injured in the spill of americium-241, but a
radiological safety officer at the base said tests showed he
inhaled a small quantity of the powder.
   The NRC said the spill occurred on Sept. 18, 1986, and was not
reported to the NRC until Sept. 26, at which time it was described
as leakage from low-level radioactive waste drums and not as a
significant spill of americium.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis visited Minnesota's delegation in
her first such foray Monday, praising the state for bucking the
Reagan landslide in 1984 and for offering her ``a new life'' free
of addiction to diet pills.
   ``I can't think of a better place to start,'' the wife of
soon-to-be presidential nominee Michael Dukakis told the Democrats
gathered for their party's national convention.
   ``Your great state was the only state with the good sense to be
in the Democratic column in 1984, and we're going to make sure that
you have lots of company in 1988,'' she said in her remarks at the
delegation's headquarters hotel.
   She also said Minnesota was the state that gave her husband his
first victory outside New England.
   Mrs. Dukakis, who received two standing ovations from the
delegates, also said she has a special feeling for the state
because of her time at Hazelden in Center City, Minn., where she
was treated for her addiction six years ago.
   ``It was in your state that I began a new life,'' she said.
``Minnesota has very precious and personal meaning to me
personally, and I will never forget it.''
   Mrs. Dukakis said she knew from eight visits to Minnesota during
her husband's presidential campaign what nearly two full terms
under a Republican administration means to the unemployed and
farmers.
   ``On the Iron Range, I saw what seven years of neglect have done
to working families and to your economy,'' she said, referring to
the economic turmoil that struck the heavily Democratic
northeastern Minnesota region in the early 1980s.
   Referring to this summer's drought and its impact on the state's
farmers, Mrs. Dukakis said, ``We need to do all we can do to make
sure no more farmers lose their farms because of this crisis.''
   To her husband, Mrs. Dukakis said, ``That means income support
for farmers, help for those with troubled loans and no more price
cuts for dairy farmers.''
   Besides recognizing those who organized her husband's campaign
in Minnesota, Mrs. Dukakis praised the organizers of Jesse
Jackson's campaign in the state for running a ``strong,
well-organized and positive campaign.''
   Minnesota's 90-member delegation includes 50 Dukakis delegates,
29 Jackson delegates, eight uncommitted delegates and three who say
they will vote for Illinois Sen. Paul Simon on the first ballot
Wednesday night.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq looked warily at war foe Iran's
acceptance Monday of a U.N. truce resolution. Its information
minister said Iran was agreeing for ``tactical reasons'' and not
out of any desire for a ``real and just peace.''
   Other states in the Persian Gulf also reacted cautiously to
Iran's announcement, which followed a string of Iraqi battlefield
victories. Tehran's only major Arab ally, Syria, praised the
decision.
   Iraqis interviewed on the street in Baghdad also were guarded in
their reactions, while expressing hope that the war, now nearly
eight years old, will end.
   In Iraq's first official reaction to Iran's announcement it was
accepting U.N. Security Council Resolution 598, Information
Minister Nassif Ltayyif Jassem was quoted as saying Iraq had
``reservations.''
   ``The Iranian General Command's statement did not explain the
reasons behind Iran's new stand in terms of a desire for a real and
just peace, but mentioned the circumstances and reasons for their
latest position in terms of tactical reasons,'' he said in
statements reported by the official Iraqi News Agency.
   Jassem appeared to be referring to a portion of the statement
which said the ``arrogant worlds,'' a reference to the United
States, had sought to portray Iraq as a ``peace-loving regime''
because of Baghdad's acceptance of the July 1987 U.N. cease-fire
resolution.
   Iran's announcement, in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, changed its position of rejecting the
resolution until Iraq was blamed for starting the conflict in
September 1980.
   The official Syrian Arab News Agency quoted an unidentified
government spokesman as saying: ``Syria expresses its satisfaction
and welcomes the wise decision of the Iranian leadership.''
   In Jordan, Foreign Minister Taher Masri pointed out conflicting
signals from Iran.
   He called the cease-fire decision ``a bit surprising, because
only a few days ago the Majlis (Iranian parliament) passed a
resolution calling for top priority for the continuation of the war
over all other issues.''
   Saudi Arabia and other gulf states did not issue immediate
official comment.
   ``Whatever it is,'' the Iranian acceptance of the U.N.
resolution ``brings joy,'' declared the semi-official Kuwait News
Agency.
   The development also ``means that Iran has chosen the wise
alternative, which calls for coexistence in peace with its
neighbors,'' the agency said.
   People in Kuwait, the Arab state closest to the battlefront,
wished each other ``mabrouk,'' or congratulations, after hearing
the news.
   In Baghdad, Mohammed Abdul Kader, a 52-year-old taxi driver who
has three sons at the front, said, ``I pray to God that the
(Iranian) statement is true and (Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini is
serious about ending this tragic war.
   ``We are both Moslem nations and it is in our interest that this
bloodletting be stopped.''
   Khomeini is Iran's spiritual and revolutionary leader.
   The Reagan administration applauded Iran's acceptance of the
U.N. resolution. But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
cautioned that ending the war ``is not going to occur overnight.''
He refused to say what impact a successful truce might have on U.S.
military strategy in the gulf.
   Iran's announcement caught the U.S. Navy in the gulf by
surprise. Officers said they would take a ``wait and see'' position
until U.S. authorities verified it as official.
   ``Holy cats! You've got to be kidding!,'' exclaimed an officer
aboard the navy's gulf-based command ship Coronado, when he was
informed of the Iranian announcement by telephone.
   About 17 U.S. warships now are in the gulf and about 10 more
outside.
   The U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, Sam H. Zakhem, said, ``It's
beautiful news. It's time for rejoicing.''
   Britain welcomed the move and pledged full support for U.N.
efforts for a cease-fire, the Foreign Office said.
   The 23-nation Arab League's ambassador to the United Nations,
Clovis Maksoud, also praised the move and said it was long overdue.
   The representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization in
Kuwait, Awni Batash, hailed Iran's decision as ``good news'' and
called for directing both the Iraqi and Iranian forces against
Israel.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres expressed
concern over the potential threat an idle Iraqi army could pose to
Israel if the Iran-Iraq war ends.
   ``Iraq has built a very large army ... The question is whether
it will turn to rehabilitating its country, or be tempted to
recapture its standing in the Arab world (by attacking Israel),''
Peres said on Israel radio.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported briefly on the developments
in the Middle East without official comment.
   The Soviet Union is among the European powers with a naval
presence in the gulf. Others included Britain, France and Italy.

<HEAD>Union Agrees to Call off Some Picketing in Truce With Kirk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union trying to organize downtown janitors said
Monday it is suspending its picketing of selected social events
associated with the Democratic convention in a truce arranged by
party chairman Paul Kirk.
   John Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International
Union, announced the ``pause'' in its campaign after Kirk
telephoned him Sunday night relaying a message that Atlanta
architect and developer John Portman had expressed a new
willingness to negotiate.
   ``We do not have a settlement,'' Sweeney said, ``but the Service
Employees is taking a pause. We will know soon whether Portman will
deliver on his promise to recognize the union and negotiate.''
   The union had focused on Portman's Peachtree Center properties
as its initial target in trying to unionize some 1,500 janitors in
56 downtown Atlanta office buildings. The center is where many of
the private receptions associated with the convention are being
held.
   On Sunday it picketed Portman's Atlanta Apparel Mart asking
Democrats not to attend a brunch inside for which the Gannett Co.
and USA Today were hosts.
   Last Friday the union picketed the Marriott Marquis hotel, which
is partly owned by Portman, prompting ABC-TV to move its ``Good
Morning America'' show this week to another hotel.
   Kirk and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young had been acting as mediators
between the two sides for more than a month, trying to head off a
visible confrontation that might disrupt the convention.
   But both went ahead with plans to attend as special guests a
dinner Portman gave at his home Sunday night for people who had
contributed $100,000 or more to the Democratic Party. As ``an act
of good faith,'' Sweeney said, the union did not carry out its
planned demonstration at Portman's home.

   The Reagan administration on Monday
applauded Iran's acceptance of a U.N. resolution demanding a
cease-fire in the war with Iraq, but took a wait-and-see stand on
whether to lower America's military profile in the Persian Gulf.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials
``don't have a reading with any real definition'' on Iran's
intentions, and cautioned that ending an 8-year-old war ``is not
going to occur overnight.''
   Officials also downplayed suggestions that Iran's action could
be good news for Americans held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian
forces. ``We don't see any connection on that'' said State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley in Washington. Fitzwater
noted ``there have not been direct discussions'' recently between
the U.S. and Iranian governments on the hostage issue.
   Fitzwater said that the U.S. Navy's mistaken attack on an Iran
Air A-300 passenger jet with 290 people on board ``may have been a
factor'' in Iran's decision, in the sense that the United States
subsequently reiterated its longterm security committment to the
region during the U.N. Security Council debate on the July 3
disaster.
   Fitzwater, briefing reporters while President Reagan commenced a
week-long vacation at his mountaintop ranch near here, refused to
say directly what impact a successful cease-fire would have on U.S.
military strategy in the gulf.
   ``But in terms of our escorting tankers and our recent
deployment of military forces there,'' he said, ``we have always
said that as hostilities end and as the war ends, we were willing
to consider a withdrawal.''
   Fitzwater noted, however, that the United States has had a
military presence in the gulf for some 40 years, saying ``our
policy has remained firm in that area and we would anticipate
continuing that.''
   Although Fitzwater noted that U.N. Ambassador Vernon Walters
confirmed Iran's acceptance of Security Council Resolution 598 with
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar earlier Monday, the
spokesman said ``we'll just have to wait and see'' how a cessation
of hostilities can be brought about.
   In Washington, Mrs. Oakley was asked if the United States
believed the Iranian decision could have any bearing on the
American hostages being held in Lebanon. ``We don't see any
connection on that,'' she replied. ``I think that we're looking at
this breakthrough today as the first step toward ending the
Iran-Iraq war.''
   Iran's leaders conveyed Tehran's embrace of the resolution to
Perez de Cuellar in a message which said that country wanted an end
to hostilities that took into account the ``interests of security
on the basis of justice,'' according to the official Islamic
Republic News Agency.
   However, Iran also said that it will not withdraw its troops
from its borders, and called on Iranians ``to prepare to thwart
further Iraqi attacks.''
   A key element of the U.N. cease-fire resolution requires the
warring parties to immediately adopt stop shooting and to withdraw
to ``internationally recognized borders.''
   Fitzwater said the U.S. response to Iran's latest move ``depends
upon what their definition is'' of accepting the resolution and
said ``we have to look into'' Tehran's intentions.
   More than a million people have been lost in the protracted
Iran-Iraq war, and the United States has been working behind the
scenes to build pressure on Iran to accept the U.N. ceasefire
resolution.
   Fitzwater emphasized that ``the issue is not really timing here.
The issue is making it happen. ... So we will proceed slowly in the
sense of trying to make sure it's real and substantial and does
indeed bring an end to the conflict there. ...''
   The spokesman said the United States is willing to be ``a party
to anything that might help the peace process. Our performance and
involvement will be measured against that ultimate objective _
bringing an end to the war.''
   ``And the U.N. has the lead here,'' Fitzwater said.
   In a formal statement delivered by Fitzwater here and by Mrs.
Oakley in Washington, the administration said: ``The United States
welcomes Iran's formal acceptance of United Nations Security
Council Resolution 598 as well as (Iraq's) President Saddam
Hussein's reaffirmation yesterday of Iraq's acceptance of the
resolution.''
   ``This major breakthrough is an important first step toward the
outcome that we and all members of the Security Council have sought
for the last year,'' the statement said. ``It opens the way for an
end to the 8-year-old tragic war and restoration of stability in a
troubled region of the world.''
   ``We call upon Iran and Iraq to cooperate urgently with United
Nations Secretary General Perez de Cuellar and the Security Council
to ensure the earliest possible implementation of Resolution 598 in
all its aspects.''
   Fitzwater said that while ``there certainly is a lot that we
don't know at this time ... one has to believe that the recent
losses that Iran has experienced at the hand of Iraq has been a
point they've had to consider.''
   He also said that ``undoubtedly, our presence in the gulf has
been a factor, and we certainly hope that it has been a factor
moving both parties toward accepting the ceasefire resolution.''

   The Kremlin decreed Monday that a region involved
in a sometimes violent ethnic dispute will remain part of
Azerbaijan, and activists in adjoining Armenia said 200,000 troops
patrolled Yerevan, Armenia's capital.
   The action is likely to cause more unrest among Armenians, who
want the Caucasus Mountain region of Nagorno-Karabakh made part of
their republic because most of its people are ethnic Armenians.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the 30-plus members of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet reached a unanimous decision after
a special session of about eight hours.
   Nagorno-Karabakh once was part of Armenia, but was assigned to
Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Mofsis Gorgisyan, an outspoken supporter of making
Nagorno-Karabakh part of Armenia, said in Yerevan that the
state-run media there had not reported the decision.
   He said security forces patrolling the city of 1.1 million had
grown to about 200,000 over the previous 24 hours, indicating
authorities expected a strong reaction.
   ``I knew earlier what the decision would be from the number of
troops here. I knew there would be no compromise,'' Gorgisyan told
The Associated Press by telephone.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Hotel Yerevan on the
central square said the Armenian version of the national television
news program ``Vremya'' reported the Presidium had met but said its
decision would not be announced until Tuesday night.
   ``All is calm here because our people don't know anything,''
said the clerk, who would not give her name.
   An announcer for the Vremya broadcast received in Moscow read
the four-paragraph Tass announcement early in the program.
   ``The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR confirmed
today that Nagorno-Karabakh belongs to Azerbaijan,'' Tass announced
after the special session.
   Vremya is broadcast at 9 p.m. in all Soviet time zones. The
Presidium decision was announced shortly after 8 p.m. in Moscow, or
9 p.m. in Yerevan, so the Tass report may not have been available
to the local television service in time for the nightly news in
Armenia.
   The territorial legislature of Nagorno-Karabakh voted July 12
for transfer to Armenia of the region, which is an enclave in
Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijan leadership quickly rejected the
decision, setting the stage for Monday's resolution of the deadlock
by the executive body of the national parliament.
   Organizers of the annexation appeal have characterized the issue
as a test of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and
willingness to redress wrongs committed by past Kremlin leaderships.
   ``This is awful,'' declared Koryun Nagapetyan, an Armenian
artist who organized Moscow demonstrations in support of
annexation. ``This will be the end of Soviet power.''
   Armenians account for at least three quarters of the 160,000
population of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region about the size of
Delaware. The Armenian population claims it has suffered neglect
and discrimination at the hands of its Azerbaijani government.
   The Presidium's decision gives the last official word to the
dispute. The body also ``made provision for measures that would
ensure the region's real autonomy as well as unconditional
fulfillment of a comprehensive program for its social, economic and
cultural development,'' Tass said.
   Gorbachev was among the national and republic officials who
addressed the Presidium gathering, according to Tass, but few
details of his speech were reported in the initial announcement.
   Tass said Gorbachev characterized the issue as one of ``great
political importance,'' and said it was vital to deal with the
annexation question calmly.
   President Andrei A. Gromyko opened the session with an appeal to
residents of the troubled Caucasus region to ``rise above emotion''
and let the issue be resolved within the framework of the Soviet
constitution.
   That document guarantees citizens the right to
self-determination, but also allows individual republic leaderships
to veto territorial decisions.
   Excerpts of speakers' comments to the Presidium were carried by
Tass. Like most high-level party and government gatherings,
meetings of the Presidium are closed to the press and public.
   Most of the Presidium members quoted criticized strikes and
demonstrations that have disrupted the region's economy since the
Nagorno-Karabakh issue came to the forefront early this year.
   Disturbances began in Nagorno-Karabakh early this year and
spread to Yerevan in late February, culminating in street
demonstrations in which as many as a million of the republic's 3.4
million residents took part.
   Gorbachev appealed for calm Feb. 26, but after the strife
tapered off in Yerevan rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani port of
Sumgait and 32 people were killed, 26 of them Armenians.
   The Communist Partry decided to invest millions of rubles in
improvements to housing, schools and cultural offerings in the
region to appease the Armenian majority but the campaign for
annexation grew.
   The Presidium's decision has repercussions for national groups
throughout the Soviet Union that have shown signs of discontent
with the central government, including the Baltic peoples and
Crimean Tatars.

   Police set up roadblocks and
guarded schools, private homes and sports fields Monday to stamp
out public celebration of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela's 70th
birthday.
   ``This day turned out into what the government wanted to be made
of it,'' said Mandela's wife, Winnie Mandela. ``We had every
intention of conveying messages of good will here in the country.''
   ``There appears to be no climate in the country for the release
of Mandela,'' she told a news conference.
   Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National Congress, has
been in prison for 26 years. He is serving a life term for sabotage
and conspiracy to overthrow the white-rule government.
   Stoffel van der Merwe, the information minister, said on
state-run television Monday night the government does not see its
way clear to free Mandela ``at this stage.''
   Speaking in Afrikaans, the language of the white Afrikaners who
control the government, he said the Mandela case is reviewed
regularly.
   Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria, head of the U.N. Special Committee
against Apartheid, said in New York: ``How many more black South
Africans ... will serve undefined jail terms before the world
stands up to proclaim that enough is enough?''
   Celebrations, protests and church services marking Mandela's
birthday Monday were held over the past few days in countries
around the world. Numerous foreign governments issued statements
calling for the black leader's release.
   In London on Monday, Christians, Buddhist monks, a rabbi and a
Moslem scholar led prayers for Mandela at the St. James Piccadilly
Church. Among the worshipers were 25 activists who had marched
about 600 miles from Glasgow, Scotland.
   Birthday concerts were scheduled in London and Amsterdam.
Hungarian state TV scheduled a 10-hour musical show in Mandela's
honor. In central Paris, campaigners planned to blow out 70 candles
outside Notre Dame Cathedral.
   Demonstrations were also held in New York City; Santiago, Chile,
and New Delhi, India.
   In South Africa, however, police banned all scheduled outdoor
events beginning last Saturday.
   About 1,500 students attended an indoor lunchtime service Monday
at the University of the Western Cape, after which participants
danced and chanted toward the campus gates, where they stoned
passing cars.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, told told a different campus audience nearly two
dozen celebration organizers detained last week under emergency
powers still were being held without charge.
   In the only other event allowed to take place, clergymen called
for Mandela's release during a service at St. Francis Roman
Catholic Church in Langa, a black township outside Cape Town.
   About 40 police marched onto the campus of the University of
Cape Town and confiscated posters and pamphlets dealing with the
Mandela birthday that had been displayed at a carnival in the
campus' main plaza, students said.
   A church delegation was temporarily halted at a roadblock on the
way to Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, where Mandela is being held.
Roadblocks were also erected in several other locations.
   Security forces, some in armored vehicles, patrolled black
townships, but no violence was reported.
   Police maintained a visible presence at schools throughout the
country and dismissed students at some schools to avoid
confrontations. They broke up a meeting at the Bontehewel high
school in the mixed race township of Athlone outside Cape Town and
sent students home.
   Mrs. Mandela, speaking at a news conference in Johannesburg,
said her husband was ``in perfect health ... and he's completely
aware of everything that's going on (around the world).''
   But she said Mandela has remained isolated in the prison
hospital since undergoing a prostate operation two years ago, and
must ask for permission to see other inmates.
   ``We have no explanation whatsoever why he is kept alone,'' she
said, standing in front of a pile of 50,000 birthday letters from
foreign supporters and a 20-foot poster of Mandela's face.
   Mandela and his wife last week turned down a government offer of
a six-hour birthday reunion, deciding instead to focus attention on
other prisoners held for anti-apartheid activities.
   Mandela was jailed in 1962 for leaving the country illegally and
inciting unrest. While serving a five-year term, he was given a
life sentence in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy in his role as
head of the ANC's military wing.
   Oliver Tambo, once Mandela's law partner and now president of
the ANC at its Lusaka, Zambia headquarters, sent a birthday message
that Mandela's youngest daughter, Zindzi, read to the news
conference in defiance of emergency restrictions.
   ``His life symbolizes our people's burning desire for freedom,''
Tambo said of Mandela. ``His imprisonment is the imprisonment of
the whole South African nation.''
   The pro-government Beeld, an Afrikaans newspaper, said in an
editorial Monday that there would never be a better time to release
Mandela.
   ``Do we really want to imprint into our history that we let an
old man die in jail while there was the opportunity to negotiate
with him on the aspirations of his people?,'' the newspaper said.
   Most of South Africa's 26 million blacks regard Mandela as the
embodiemnt of black resistance to apartheid even though they have
never seen him or heard him speak. It is illegal to publish current
pictures of him or quote his words.

<TEXT>
   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, who solicited
keynote speech ideas from scores of close friends, depended heavily
on a hand-written letter scrawled on yellow paper by a small-town
Texan who had been inspired by a Richards speech.
   ``For a number of years I've wondered if people like us are the
forgotten,'' the 39-year-old mother of three said in her June
letter to Ms. Richards. ``We're not the poor and we're not the
rich. We're not the very young or the aged. We're the average
American family.''
   The woman, who lives in Lorena, Texas, not far from Ms.
Richards' hometown of Waco, gave permission for quotes from her
letter to be used in the Monday night keynote speech at the
Democratic National Convention. But Bill Cryer, Ms. Richards' press
secretary, said the permission was conditioned on anonymity.
   ``She is like your neighbor. She doesn't want a bunch of TV
trucks out in her yard. She doesn't want the publicity,'' Cryer
said.
   In the letter, the woman told Ms. Richards that life has changed
from the ``Leave It to Beaver'' days of her youth. She is an
administrator at a mental retardation facility and her husband is a
telephone installer. Both are college graduates.
   They make about $50,000 a year and it is barely enough for the
necessities, the woman told Ms. Richards.
   ``We balance our checkbook and hope we have enough to pay our
monthly bills. We don't live off credit cards. We were able, just
last year, to buy a house. We ponder and try to figure out how
we're going to be able to pay for college, braces and tennis
shoes,'' she said.
   ``We are the people you see every day in grocery stores and on
the streets. We obey the laws, pay our taxes and fly our flags on
holidays. We are silent people who plod along trying to make it
better for ourselves and our children and our parents,'' said the
mother of a 15-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 12 and 7.
   The daily grind leaves no time for the idealism she said she had
felt as a ``child of the '60s.''
   ``Ms. Richards, I really thought we could and would make a
difference, make it better. But now my priorities are much
different and much more self-centered,'' she said.
   ``The `Leave It to Beaver' syndrome of dad is successful, mom
stays home and bakes cookies, and the biggest problem is the Beav
has a zit on his chin, is gone. I have no energy left to think of
the starvation, injustices and cruelties of the world.
   ``I worry about how in the hell am I going to pay the rising car
insurance, house insurance and food. I pray my kids don't have a
growth spurt from August to December so I have to buy new jeans or
shows,'' she told Ms. Richards.
   The woman said she feared her letter made her sound ungrateful
for what she has.
   ``We're not street people and we're healthy,'' she noted. ``I do
have blessings for those things, but because of all the other
horrible things in this world I believe people like us are
forgotten.''

   Jesse Jackson on Monday promised disciplined
floor fights on the party's platform _ which he warned his
delegates they may lose _ as he discussed the future after his 1988
presidential campaign ends at this week's Democratic National
Convention.
   Only hours before the opening session of the convention, Jackson
rallied his delegates with a stirring speech and some tough
admonitions.
   He also told them to gather again Friday after the convention to
plot their role in the fall campaign.
   ``This is the first time since Jamestown, Va. ... that we've had
the right to take to the floor any issue of our interest ... the
first time ... the first time ... the first time in 400 years,''
the preacher told more than 2,000 delegates and supporters at his
headquarters hotel.
   ``We can't lose. We came in a winner. Let's enhance our winning
by discipline,'' Jackson added. ``When the lights come on tonight,
our foreparents will be crying from their graves.''
   When Jackson delegates are faced with media interviews on the
convention floor, they should ``follow my lead ... reflect my
spirit, attitude and discipline,'' he said.
   Over and over again, he led the delegates in a chant:
``Discipline. Details. Hope.''
   Jackson mentioned Democratic nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis in
positive tones, but did not issue a rally cry for the fall.
Instead, he phrased it in terms of his supporters being part of the
fall campaign and of the party at all levels.
   Jackson said his forces already had won major battles on the
party platform that will come up for a vote during Tuesday's
convention session _ mentioning in particular its designation of
South Africa as a terrorist state.
   ``But there is unfinished business,'' he said, mentioning budget
planks and a plank calling for a ``no first use'' of nuclear
weapons policy.
   ``It's not right to be in the seats on the floor tonight and not
in the budget next January,'' Jackson told his delegates.
   But he warned that they may _ and probably will _ lose to the
Dukakis forces who have the numbers to control the convention floor.
   ``If you negotiate away your self respect, you lose before you
get to the floor. We can afford to lose a vote. We cannot afford to
lose our self-respect,'' Jackson said.
   To those who ask where the fireworks will be between Dukakis and
Jackson, he said: ``We did not come here for fireworks. We came
here for noble works.''
   Jackson told a news conference of foreign reporters that he and
Dukakis did not discuss the platform at their Monday morning
meeting.
   Instead, they dealt with their relationship, ``some focus on our
campaign for the fall'' and Jackson's role in that campaign and
``some focus on the DNC,'' he said, referring to the Democratic
National Committee.
   Jackson told his delegates and supporters that he wanted them
all back in the room for a meeting Friday, the day after the
convention ends, to talk about where the movement goes and what
they will do in the fall campaign.
   The platform was one of four items he detailed as his agenda for
the future beyond 1988.
   A second apparently was a detail of his agreement with Dukakis,
struck at the Monday morning meeting.
   ``When the Democratic National Committee meets on Friday, it
will be more reflective of the new Democratic Party,'' he said.
Twenty-five at-large members of the DNC will be appointed Friday
and apparently Jackson supporters will receive some of those seats.
   Another part of Jackson's future plans is a political action
committee, which he calls Keep Hope Alive PAC.
   And the fourth point on his agenda was a state-by-state effort
to enact on-site election-day registration and wipe out closing the
registration books 30 days before the voting.
   In another hint of the future, Jackson said proudly: ``We
negotiated new rules for 1992.''
   At the news conference with foreign reporters, Jackson said he
hoped Iran's announced acceptance of a cease fire in its war with
Iraq would be a positive sign ``to gain the opportunity of freeing
the American hostages.''

<HEAD>Levin Calls Findings `Devastating' To Attorney General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent counsel's conclusion that Edwin
Meese III probably broke a conflict-of-interest law undermines the
attorney general's claim the prosecutor's report vindicated him,
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Monday.
   ``The findings I believe are devastating to Mr. Meese, to his
claim he has been ethical,'' Levin, chairman of a Senate
subcommittee that investigated the attorney general's involvement
in the Wedtech scandal, told reporters here.
   ``How anyone other than Ed Meese could claim that this report
vindicates him is beyond me,'' Levin said after independent counsel
James C. McKay's 814-page report of the 14-month Meese
investigation was released in Washington.
   McKay concluded that the attorney general probably willfully
filed a false income tax return that omitted mention of capital
gains earnings on the sale of the Meese's stock in Baby Bell
companies created after the breakup of AT&T.
   The independent counsel also found that Meese broke a federal
ethics law by initiating a review of antitrust policy on the
telecommunications industry while he and his wife, Ursula, owned
the telephone stock.
   Levin, who was attending the Democratic National Convention,
said he wouldn't ``second-guess'' McKay's decision not to prosecute
Meese even though the independent counsel concluded there was
evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
   Noting he had ``fought too hard'' for the independent counsel
law that was recently upheld by the Supreme Court, Levin said he
wouldn't say ``anything to undermine the independence of the
independent counsel.''
   ``His decision not to prosecute, although he found evidence very
damaging to Mr. Meese, is something within his jurisdiction and we
accept it,'' Levin said.
   ``I am satisfied there is insufficient evidence of wrongdoing to
prosecute, otherwise the independent counsel would have
prosecuted,'' the senator added.
   McKay said he decided not to press criminal charges because
``there is no evidence that Mr. Meese acted from motivation for
personal gain, there is no evidence that he acted out of
self-interest.''
   Meese announced plans to resign the day McKay completed his
investigation by filing the report with a special court.
   The attorney general, who had not read the report when he
commented, said he was vindicated because no criminal charges were
brought against him.
   Levin, one of Meese's most outspoken critics on Capitol Hill,
said he would ask the Office of Government Ethics to review McKay's
report to determine if the attorney general violated a presidential
order to avoid any appearance of ethical conflicts.
   Although Meese is leaving office at month's end, ``we need an
Office of Government Ethics judgment as to whether Mr. Meese's
activities actually constituted a violation of the executive order
and other standards of ethics.''
   ``It's important that standards be set for future attorneys
general,'' Levin said.
   Such an investigation is needed because ``the administration has
been lax in general on the standards it sets for ethics, Meese is
but a part of that,'' Levin said.
   President Reagan has been too tolerant of the ethical lapses of
officials in his administration, expressing only regret when they
resigned under a cloud or were convicted of criminal wrongdoing,
Levin said.
   ``There should be a sense of outrage on the part of the
president they have betrayed,'' Levin said.
   Levin's Senate Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee
concluded that Meese's intervention helped the scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. get a lucrative defense contract. Meese's longtime
friend, E. Bob Wallach, was representing Wedtech at the time.
   McKay's report supported that conclusion, which Meese and his
lawyers have steadfastly disputed.
   ``There is a direct conflict between what Meese has been saying
about his role in Wedtech and what the independent counsel found
today,'' Levin said.

   Attorneys for four Navajos accused of
slaying two tribal policemen told jurors Monday that their clients
were not even at the crime scene.
   ``If you think it's all going to be tidied up and you're going
to know what went on _ you're not, because they arrested the wrong
men,'' said Walter Bugden, attorney for defendant Marques Atene, as
the murder trial for the four got under way.
   Atene, 22; his cousin Ben Atene Jr., 24; Vinton Bedoni, 31; and
Thomas Cly, 22, are charged with first-degree murder in the Dec. 4
deaths of officers Andy Begay and Roy Lee Stanley. The victims'
charred bodies were found in in a remote Utah canyon.
   In the prosecution's opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Stewart C. Walz said Stanley had arrested Cly about a month before
the killings. Cly threatened the officer's life in front of a
witness, Walz said.
   On the night of the killings, Walz said, Stanley got into a
fight with Cly and Bedoni at a party. The officer was beaten and
forced to summon Begay by radio, the prosecutor said, then both
officers were shot and taken to a canyon southeast of Lake Powell.
   The two officers were placed in one of their police trucks,
which was doused with gasoline and set afire, Walz said. An autopsy
showed the two were alive when they were set on fire, he said.
   Attorney Robert VanSciver, representing Bedoni, acknowledged the
crimes were brutal. But, he said, ``All four of these men were not
present at the date and time these crimes were committed.''
   All four defense attorneys said the reliability of prosecution
witnesses would be an issue.
   The trial is being held in federal court because the killing
occurred on an Indian reservation.

<HEAD>Alaska Airline Gets Tentative Go-Ahead to Resume Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department on Monday gave
Ryan Air Service, once the largest commuter airline in Alaska, the
go-ahead to resume operations, pending another safety review by the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   Ryan Air Service, which flew to 70 communities and was an
important transportation link in western Alaska, was ordered
grounded last January after the FAA found numerous safety
violations.
   The airline filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws last
February.
   After the FAA action, the Transportation Department lifted
Ryan's operating certificate, citing its poor safety record as well
as management and financial problems.
   Ryan Air has had 12 crashes in the last eight years, including
nine accidents in the last three years. A Ryan Air aircraft that
crashed near Homer, Alaska, killing 18 people, last November was
believed to have been overloaded.
   The Transportation Department said that a series of management
changes, including actions to separate the airline's day-to-day
operations from the Ryan family, as well as a restructuring of the
company's finances led to the decision to restore the operating
certificate.
   The FAA, meanwhile, said that it would not allow Ryan to resume
flights until the agency completes a further review of the
airlines' planned operations and compliance with safety
regulations. The review will include inspections of Ryan's ground
facilities and a check of pilot records.
   The department said its order restoring the airline its
certificate to operate would not go into effect until the FAA
review is completed.
   In its order, the department noted that Ryan Air Service, which
is based in Anchorage, ``has had a troubled compliance history
marked by numerous accidents and violations of federal rules.''
   But the department said its concerns about Ryan's past
management problems have been eased by recent actions taken by the
airline, including the selection of a trustee and new board of
directors as well as changes in key personnel running the airline.
   Furthermore, said the department, arrangements for new lines of
credit and a reduction in fleet size and operations indicate that
the airline ``now has adequate financial resources to resume
operations.''

   Two Soviet teams were to arrive Tuesday in
Britain for the first inspections in that country under the treaty
banning superpower medium-range missiles, a U.S. spokesman
announced Monday.
   The Soviets were to arrive at Greenham Common at 1 p.m. GMT (9
a.m. EDT) and inspect two sites there on Wedneday, said Lt. Col.
Joseph Wagovich, a spokesman for the On-Site Inspection Agency.
   Seven U.S. teams are in the Soviet Union conducting what are
called ``base-line inspections'' to determine the accuracy of
information exhanged under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force
Treaty signed at the Washington summit last December by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``Everything seems to be going very well,'' said Wagovich.
   The head of the U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency, Brig. Gen.
Roland Lajoie, told reporters last Thursday that neither side had
discovered any violations of the INF pact.
   Under the treaty, which calls for elimination of all superpower
missiles with ranges of 340-to-3,000 miles over about three years,
the Soviet Union is to destroy about 6,000 items, consisting of
missiles and related components, and the United States to destroy
2,000 items, said Lajoie.

   A 15-year-old girl attending her first national
political convention announced Monday she will seek a seat in the
U.S. Senate in the year 2006 to represent a state that does not yet
exist.
   Meta Jones launched her campaign to represent the state of New
Columbia when and if the nation's capital ever gets full voting
representation in the Senate.
   Ms. Jones said she has begun an 18-year campaign because she has
learned as the captain of her junior high school cross-country
track team that ``it doesn't matter if one runner is born with the
gift of strength and speed, it takes teamwork and endurance to
accomplish anything.''
   The Constitution requires senators to be at least 30 years old.
   ``One reason I began my campaign was to call attention to the
blatant injustice of taxation without representation. This is
definitely exhibited in the D.C. statehood case,'' said the
energetic Ms. Jones, who is running as a candidate of the D.C.
Statehood Party.
   She said she was ``enraged'' by recent House and Senate votes
supporting repeal of the requirement that city workers must live
within the District of Columbia.
   Two other issues that will be a focus for Ms. Jones' campaign
are drug-trafficking and homelessness.
   Saying that part of the problem with drug-trafficking is
``idleness and ignorance'' Ms. Jones suggests establishing teen
centers throughout the District to serve as headquarters of a
network that would ``get the message across to teens about the
detrimental effect drugs have, not just on the abusers, but on the
entire community.''
   The Democratic platform calls for statehood for the District of
Columbia. Currently, the district has just one non-voting delegate
to the House of Representatives.

   Much of the nation continued to swelter Monday, while
thunderstorms and showers were reported in scattered sections of
the eastern half of the nation.
   Temperatures rose to the 90s by late morning from the northern
California valleys to the desert areas. In much of the rest of the
nation, the mercury rose to the 80s or 90s.
   Although not enough to herald an end to the drought, showers and
thunderstorms developed from the south-central Great Lakes region
through the central Appalachians into the southern mid-Atlantic
region and the Carolinas. A severe thunderstorm watch was posted in
parts of the area.
   An inch and a half of rain fell within an hour at Fond du Lac,
Wis., Monday afternoon, and more than an inch at Fort Wayne, Ind.,
during the morning and early afternoon.
   Another line of storms ran from the middle Mississippi Valley
into central Oklahoma.
   Scattered storms was reported along the central Gulf Coast and
across central and southern Florida. Isolated showers and
thunderstorms also developed in central Colorado, northeast New
Mexico and the Texas Panhandle.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at San Simeon, Calif., to 103 degrees at Barstow, Calif.
The early-morning low for the nation was 36 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo.
   Tuesday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms in the central Plains; the middle Mississippi, Ohio
and Tennessee valleys; the mid-Atlantic coast; New England; the
central Gulf Coast; and Florida.
   Highs should reach the middle to upper 70s from the central and
northern Plains through the northern half of the Great Lakes and
across Maine; 100 to 105 degrees in central Texas into the Rio
Grande Valley, and in the desert southwest into central Oregon; up
to 115 degrees from western Arizona through the California valleys;
and in the 80s and 90s in most of the rest of the nation.

   Independent Counsel James McKay and Attorney
General Edwin Meese III exchanged accusations across the same
podium Monday, but neither said he would back up his allegations
with action.
   McKay repeated assertions in his 814-report that Meese committed
three felonies and a misdemeanor but said he would not file charges.
   Meese, appearing at a news conference minutes after McKay had
left the same National Press Club hall, said he was ``outraged''
and ``appalled'' at McKay's report and would fire any Justice
Department lawyer who filed such a document. But Meese declined to
say whether he would attempt to seek any redress against McKay.
   The conclusion of McKay's $1.7 million investigation was
bittersweet for the attorney general who has announced he will
resign at the end of the month now that he believes he is
vindicated.
   He said the fact that McKay is not filing charges exonerates him
and will allow him to ask the federal government to pay his legal
fees, which a lawyer said were approaching $250,000 six months ago.
   But the accusations from McKay ``violated all principles of
fairness and decency,'' Meese said.
   Meese's chief laywer, Nathan Lewin, at at third press club news
conference after the report was issued, accused McKay of ``hit and
run'' and said the accusations against Meese were ``a cheap shot.''
   McKay said Meese probably committed felonies in filing a false
tax return that omitted some income before the return was amended
and in dealing with two separate matters that might affect the
telephone industry while holding onto stock in a telephone company.
He said Meese also committed a misdemeanor in failing to file a tax
return on time.
   In addition, McKay accused Meese, both in the report and at the
news conference, of insensitivity in dealings as a government
official with his close friend, E. Robert Wallach.
   But the prosecutor declined to respond to questions about
whether Meese should be disbarred or whether he was relieved that
Meese has submitted his resignation.
   McKay defended the high cost of the investigation, saying, ``I
didn't spend it personally ... I feel confident we have not wasted
any government funds, any of the taxpayers' money.''
   Asked how he would respond to a lawsuit from Meese if one is
filed, he said, ``I've been sued before.''
   But neither Meese nor his lawyers said they would file a suit
against McKay, and lawyer Lewin said that although he considered
McKay's actions unreasonable he said he would not call his actions
unethical and thought he was an ``honorable man.''
   Meese said he would not discuss any actions he might take.
   ``I'm outraged at the tarnishing of our system of justice that
has gone on this afternoon and with the filing of the report of the
independent counsel,'' Meese said.
   He said all of his actions had been taken ``legally, ethically
and properly, and any implication by the independent counsel that I
have in any way violated any law is absolutely false.''
   Meese accused McKay of making the accusations in an attempt to
justify what he said was a lengthy, expensive and fruitless
investigation.

   Democrats broke a 25-year streak of squabbling on
Monday by seating more than 4,000 delegates and adopting major
rules without dissent to open their nominating convention on a rare
note of harmony.
   ``That's the first sign of unity and unanimity in this party and
we're on the move,'' Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk told the opening
convention session, as a parade of speakers congratulated delegates
for not engaging in political fratricide.
   ``Each resolution, each matter of business before us, was
adopted without dissenting vote,'' said Kathy Vick, chairwoman of
the Rules Committee.
   ``We had 24 disagreements and we resolved every one of those
disagreements before we had a meeting,'' Credentials Committee
Chairman Leroy Irvis said.
   ``Democrats always have disputes,'' said Rep. Pat Schroeder,
D-Colo., a credentials co-chairwoman.``That says to me that while
we had differences, being Democrats, we knew in 1988 the important
differences were between Democrats and the continuation of the
Reagan proposals, which we cannot stand.''
   Negotiators for Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson reached
agreement weeks ago to allow the convention to open in harmony.
   The delegates also chose House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas to
serve as convention chairman.
   The Rules and Credentials committees ratified the deals last
month and adoption by the full convention never was in doubt.
   Opposing campaigns have often carried their battles to the
convention hall as they sought to disqualify each others' delegate
slates for one rules infraction or another.
   ``There has been a challenge every time,'' said Jim Carey, staff
director of the Credentials Committee, which certifies who can cast
votes as delegates on the floor of the convention. ``This is the
first time that there haven't been any challenges in a quarter of a
century.''
   Dukakis came to the convention with enough delegates to win the
nomination plus a 600-delegate cushion that allowed him to give in
to Jackson demands for added representation in the Indiana and
Kansas delegations.
   However, Dukakis' biggest concession to Jackson was in allowing
a rewrite of the party's delegate selection rules for 1992 to make
the process more closely conform to the popular will expressed at
the primaries and caucuses.
   Specifically, the new rules will eliminate the direct-election
and ``bonus'' primaries, which had the effect of awarding delegates
on a ``winner-take-more'' basis.
   Essentially, Dukakis decided to abolish the rules that he used
to great advantage in capturing the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   Those systems in states such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts allowed Dukakis to rack up wide delegate margins,
giving him the lead he needed to clinch the nomination on the last
day of the primary season.
   In the New Jersey primary, for example, Jackson received nearly
one-third of the votes but got only 9 delegates, while Dukakis won
100 delegates on his 64 percent showing at the polls.
   Another change for 1992 will be a dramatic reduction in the
number of ``super delegates.''
   The 1988 convention set aside 643 seats for politicians or party
leaders, who became delegates automatically because of the offices
they held. Four years from now, that will be reduced to 394.
   These super delegates are free to support whomever they like.
Dukakis wound up with more than 10 times as many as Jackson.
   The makeup of the Democratic National Committee also will be
affected by new rules, although state parties are not required to
comply with the new provisions. Each state complying with the new
rule, which calls for allocating DNC members in much the same way
as national convention delegates, would be rewarded with an
additional member on the DNC.

   Police wielded batons against
hundreds of brick-hurling rioters Monday to clear the last major
stronghold of squatters in the city once known for its vibrant
counterculture of illegal dwellers.
   The 300 riot police met fierce resistance when they appeared in
their armored vans shortly after dawn Monday to clear the
Conradstraat, a complex of four former portside military warehouses
that had been taken over by squatters three years ago.
   Scores of sympathetic anti-establishment demonstrators had
massed in an adjacent vacant lot Sunday night in anticipation of
the previously announced eviction. They set fire to hastily erected
barricades and hurled mounds of broken-up paving stones when police
arrived.
   Rioters drove back police repeatedly, but were cleared from the
area after more than two hours.
   The fires spread to the four-story brick buildings of the
squatter complex.
   At least five rioters were arrested for disorderly conduct and
two policemen were injured, according to police.
   The police, in helmets and carrying shields, chased the
demonstrators from the area rather than arresting most of them.
   Fireboats and firetrucks doused the fires. Heavy equipment later
began demolishing the warehouses, which will be replaced by
low-income housing.
   The squatter communities were spawned by a housing shortage
during the 1960s. The police evictions have evolved into a mode of
anti-establishment protest.
   The rioters Monday came from outside the Conradstraat squatter
community, according to squatters.
   Conradstraat, which has become well-known in Amsterdam for its
artists' studios and businesses, had become a fixture in the
portside community.
   Outside agitators were expelled from the Conradstraat complex
Sunday night to prevent violence, said one occupant, a 27-year-old
sculptor who identified himself only as Alex.
   On Monday, most of the approximately 140 occupants who lived or
worked in the Conradstraat had abandoned the complex.
   ``I'm not glad to leave,'' said another occupant, who identified
herself only as Annette, 42. She said and her 7-year-old twin
daughters had lived in the complex for two years, drawing welfare
payments.
   Annette said she plans to find another place to live in isolated
squatter houses still existing in Amsterdam.

   A federal magistrate ordered on Monday
that the government unseal three search warrants and other
documents in connection with its massive defense procurement
investigation, but allowed 10 days for an appeal of the decision.
   The documents pertain to the government's investigation of a
senior Air Force procurement officer and two private consultants
all of whose homes were searched as part of the investigation into
fraud in the defense industry.
   U.S. Magistrate James Kenkel directed that both the warrants
used to search the three homes and the inventory of items taken by
authorities be made public.
   ``The very scope of (this) investigation ... has overriding and
broad public interest,'' the judge said, suggesting that the public
would be better served if news stories on the subject be based on
the legal documents instead of rumor.
   Judge Kenkel said the more sensitive affidavits used to support
the request for the warrants could remain sealed another 45 days.
   The request to unseal the documents were made in a petition
filed by The Washington Post, which argued that a month already had
passed since the documents were put under seal and there has been
considerable public interest in the investigation.
   Federal prosecutors heading the investigation argued, however,
that disclosure of information contained in the documents would
hinder their continuing investigations.
   The documents, including the inventory list of items taken by
police, ``would give a broad outline of what the government is
looking for, what the government has found and more important what
the government doesn't have,'' argued Joseph J. Aronica, assistant
U.S. attorney for the Eastern District where the probe is centered.
   He suggested that other targets of the investigation could use
the information to fashion future testimony or to destroy documents.
   But Kenkel said he wasn't convinced by assertions by Aronica
that the federal investigation would be harmed, suggesting that
other targets of the probe likely already know that they might be
implicated.
   The documents ordered unsealed pertain to Victor Cohen, deputy
assistant secretary of the Air Force in charge of buying tactical
command, control and communications systems; William Sanda, a
defense industry consultant; and Richard Seelmeyer, the operator of
an air charter service and former congressional staffer involved in
defense appropriations.
   Aronica said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the
decision which requires the unsealing of the search warrants and
inventory documents within 10 days if no appeal is filed.
   The Washington Post had sought immediate release of the
affidavits as well. Barbara Percival, the newspaper's attorney,
said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the verdict as
it pertains to the affidavits.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen worked Monday to win over
delegates skeptical of him as a vice presidential candidate by
playing down his differences with liberal Michael Dukakis and
urging party unity for a victory in November.
   The Texas senator also took time out to join House Speaker Jim
Wright in sending to President Reagan the bill requiring businesses
to give workers advance notice of plant closings. Reagan has
promised to veto it.
   Launching a mini-campaign among state delegations at the
Democratic National Convention, Bentsen was received warmly.
Disappointment among Jesse Jackson's supporters over Bentsen's
selection by Dukakis may have eased after Jackson, Dukakis and
Bentsen held a unity press conference.
   ``We're going to face a tough fight in November of 1988,''
Bentsen said, standing alongside the two other party leaders. ``But
with this kind of unity and the motivational work of Rev. Jackson
and the leadership of Michael Dukakis ... I'm convinced we're going
to win a great victory in November.''
   Bentsen received hearty applause from a caucus of Hispanic
Democrats, especially when he exhorted them in Spanish to ``give it
the gas.''
   Bentsen told the group that he was born and reared on the Rio
Grande and was committed to improving health care, education and
job opportunity for Hispanics across the country.
   Hispanics, a major voting bloc in states representing 71 percent
of the votes to win the electoral college, ``can make the
difference and carry this for Mike Dukakis,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Bentsen spokesman Jack Devore vehemently denied that
a Mailgram sent to Bentsen's Senate campaign supporters was an
attempt to distance himself in that election from his ties to
Dukakis.
   In the Mailgram, Bentsen asked conservative Texas supporter to
back his Senate re-election campaign ``regardless of your
commitments in the presidential race.''
   ``He knew there would be misunderstanding about being on both
these ballots,'' Devore said.
   Under Texas law, opponent Rep. Beau Boulter would automatically
be elected if Bentsen dropped out of the Senate race. Devore said
Bentsen wants a special election to fill his seat if he is elected
vice president.
   Asked whether the Mailgram was an example of competing interests
of the candidate, Devore said, ``How is it in conflict? Absolutely
not.''
   At an early morning meeting of the New Jersey delegation,
Bentsen was greeted by an ovation but also some Jackson placards.
When he saw the Ohio crowd afterward, he received sustained
applause.
   ``I just left a meeting with Gov. Dukakis and Jesse Jackson and
we have put it all together,'' he declared.
   He also took a little ribbing from Sen. John Glenn, who clearly
was his home state's favorite for the number-two slot.
   ``Somehow the name Bentsen didn't get spelled quite right on
some of these bumper stickers,'' said Glenn, holding up and giving
to Bentsen a ``Dukakis-Glenn'' sticker. He told Bentsen he expected
to see it attached to the Texan's car on Capitol Hill.
   Bentsen throughout the day repeated themes on which there's no
disagreement between the Dukakis and Bentsen camps _ more money for
infant care and education, and the need for trade legislation and
the plant closing bill.
   Bentsen joined with Dukakis, House Speaker Wright and Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd at a ceremony to send Reagan the plant
closing bill recently completed by Congress.
   The measure requires that companies with 100 or more workers
give 60 days' notice before closing a plant or laying off large
numbers of workers.
   It was originally a provision in the trade bill Reagan vetoed
earlier this year, and the president said it was a key reason for
his disapproval.
   But Congress then passed a separate plant closing bill by more
than the two-thirds majority of both houses that would be needed to
override a presidential veto.
   Byrd and Wright, a fellow Texan, praised Bentsen, who as Senate
Finance Committee chairman shepherded the trade bill through the
Senate and was instrumental in the plant closing legislation.
   Bentsen said, ``The Republicans have really chosen themselves a
loser on this one,'' by opposing the bill.
   ``It is the kind of bill we won't have to send to Michael
Dukakis twice,'' said Byrd of West Virginia.
   ``Senator Byrd not only won't have to send bills like this to me
twice, I'm going to be proposing them,'' Dukakis promised.
   Dukakis praised the measure as ``not just a plant closing law''
but a ``job saving law.''
   ``This is opportunity at its best. This is what the American
success story is all about,'' Dukakis said.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A man whose family had tried to have
him committed was charged Monday with murder for allegedly taking
pot shots at motorists as he roamed his neighborhood, killing four
people and wounding five, authorities said.
   The 12-minute spree ended late Sunday after deputies returned
the gunman's fire, critically wounding him, Forsyth County Sheriff
Preston Oldham said. The man was expected to survive, he said.
   Two first-degree murder warrants were issued for Michael Charles
Hayes, 24, of Clemmons, and other charges were expected, the
sheriff said.
   ``As to motive, at this time we have no idea,'' Oldham said.
``No one can answer that other than the suspect.''
   Hayes' stepfather, Garis Edwards, said family members tried to
have him committed to a mental hospital Satuday after he broke one
of his hands beating a wall. Hospital workers who treated his
injured hand declined to commit him, Edwards said, and the
sheriff's office said the commitment could wait until Monday.
   ``It seems to me, Monday was a little bit late,'' Edwards said.
The sheriff's office had no immediate comment on Edwards' statement.
   Hayes had been living at a small moped shop he operated,
officials said. ``He was real paranoid, one of the most paranoid
people I've ever seen,'' said a neighbor, Stan Parks, whose family
huddled on the floor as two shots struck their house. ``He was
inferring like everybody was out to get him. But no one here in the
neighborhood had ever complained about him.''
   He added however that neighbors didn't consider Hayes to be
dangerous, even though he frequently shot a gun in a large, wooded
field behind the shop. ``He always treated me respectfully,'' Parks
said.
   An officer at the scene Monday, who would not give his name,
said the gunman took ``pot luck,'' shooting at any car driving
through the neighborhood. Three people were found dead in their
cars near the shop and a fourth died at a hospital. One of the
victims was a 16-year-old girl.
   One of the wounded, James G. Boyd, said he and a friend were
returning from a golf game when they stopped at an intersection.
   ``He came right up to the passenger window with a rifle and shot
point-blank. I didn't have time to duck and it hit me in the right
thigh,'' said Boyd, who was treated at a local hospital and
released.
   ``He came up to the truck pretty quick,'' Boyd said in a
telephone interview. ``I guess we were at the wrong place at the
wrong time.''
   Police got their first call at 11:32 p.m. Sunday. Oldham said
two patrol cars were hit by bullets when officers drove to the
shop, and deputies returned fire. No deputies were injured.
   Deputies had responded to a disturbance call in the area
Saturday and had advised Hayes' family on involuntary commitment
proceedings for mental institutions, Oldham said. He refused to
give details, but said no charges were filed.
   Sheriff's officer L.J. Vann declined to comment Monday night on
the stepfather's charge that the family had been told to wait until
Monday to commit Hayes.
   ``We cannot verify or deny'' those statements, said Vann, adding
that any further comment would have to come from department
officials, who were not immediately available.
   Bonnie Morell, a spokesman for the state Division of Mental
Health in Raleigh, said North Carolina law allows anyone who
believes a person is mentally ill and dangerous to petition a
magistrate for involuntary commitment.
   The magistrate can then order the person taken into custody for
an evaluation, Ms. Morell said. Depending on the results of the
initial evaluation, the person is released or sent to an
institution for a more extensive evaluation.
   Hayes' wife was nine months pregnant and had left him within the
last two weeks, said a friend, who only give his name as Luther. He
and several other of Hayes' friends were outside the moped shop
Monday afternoon.
   ``The last time I saw him was two weeks ago and he was on top of
the world,'' Luther said.
   Oldham said investigators had been unable to interview Hayes
because of his injuries.
   Roger Rollman, a spokesman for North Carolina Baptist Hospital,
said Hayes was in critical condition Monday with gunshot wounds to
the groin, leg and back.
   One of the wounded was in critical condition with a neck wound,
one was in intensive care, one was in satisfactory condition, one
was in stable condition and one was treated and released.
   Oldham identified the dead as Thomas Walter Nicholson, 24, of
Winston-Salem; Crystal Susan Cantrell, 16, of Winston-Salem;
Melinda Yvonne Hayes, 21, of Lexington, not related to the man who
was charged; and Ronald Lee Hull, 32, of Winston-Salem.

<TEXT>
   Rescue workers struggled through
knee-deep mud Monday looking for more victims of mudslides and
flooding in northeastern Brazil after five days of rains killed 57
people and left 46,000 homeless.
   All the dead to date and 40,000 of the homeless were in state of
Alagoas, which has the coastal city of Maceio as its capital.
   In Maceio, 1,480 miles northeast of Rio, Civil Defense spokesman
Col. Jaime Ferreira said floodwaters were up to three feet deep in
downtown areas. Residents were being evacuated from 12 hillside
neighborhoods, where homes threatened to slip down steep inclines.
   ``More rains are forecast for the next days and we're trying to
get people out of dangerous areas as fast as possible to save
lives,'' Ferreira told The Associated Press by telephone from the
region.
   The city of 600,000 was almost isolated. Roads were cut off by
mudslides and telephone and electricity networks were badly damaged
by torrential rains.
   In nearby Recife, police said up to 6,000 people in Pernambuco
state were forced from their homes by the flooding.
   Brazil has been hit by unusually cold waves during this Southern
Hemisphere winter. An antartic cold front has chilled the southern
cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo and caused heavy rains in
the impoverished northeast, better known for heat and drought.
Weather forecasters said the cold spell was expected to last
through September.

labor that they were trying to ruin free enterprise by asking for
60 days notice of plant closings, and they're wrong. ...

<HEAD>Extradition Upheld Of Argentines Accused in Twins' Kidnapping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court upheld a ruling to
extradite an Argentine couple accused of kidnapping twin boys whose
parents disappeared during the former military regime's ``dirty
war,'' a newspaper reported Monday.
   The Asuncion daily Ultima Hora said the court upheld a March
ruling by Judge Benito Llanes to extradite Samuel Miara and Alicia
Castillo de Miara to Argentina to face charges of falsifying public
documents and abducting the twins to raise as their own.
   The couple had appealed, claiming they were the parents of the
11-year-old twins and that they faced political persecution if
returned to Argentina. The court ruling, however, left the Miaras
with no further legal recourse. No date was given for an
extradition, nor was the date available on which the decision was
rendered.
   The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo human rights group in
Buenos Aires says it has proof the Miaras are not the real parents
of the twins, whom it identifies as Gustavo and Ariel Rosetti Ross.
It says the natural parents vanished and are presumed dead.
   The group searches for children who were born in captivity or
who disappeared after being abducted during Argentina's 1976-83
military dictatorship. It is an offshoot of the Mothers of the
Plaza de Mayo group, which itself is made up of relatives of the
missing, .
   At least 9,000 people vanished without a trace during the harsh
campaign waged by the rightist military to rid Argentina of
suspected leftist subversives. Rights groups claim the number of
missing is closer to 30,000.

<HEAD>Airport Crowds Ease, Officials Call For Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flight delays which have forced thousands of
tourists to camp out in airports eased Monday, but officials called
for changes to combat an expected summer of congestion.
   Airport officials said the situation improved following the
settlement last Wednesday of a Greek air traffic controllers'
strike, and because only one out of three unions joined a French
controllers' strike.
   About 1,000 people on Mediterranean-bound flights spent the
night at London's Gatwick airport Sunday, down from 4,000 on the
airport's most crowded nights last week, airport spokesman Jennifer
Johnston said.
   ``Some flights are being delayed fifteen minutes, some a couple
of hours, but there are only a handful of long delays _ it's not
looking too bad at all,'' she said.
   Manchester's Ringway airport in northern England, where flights
were delayed up to 48 hours last week, was experiencing 10-hour
delays Monday, At Glasgow airport, Scotland's main holiday airport,
12-hour delays were reported.
   Although British airports normally experience long delays in
July and August due to the large numbers of Britons who travel to
southern Europe for vacations, last week's delays were made worse
by the Greek controllers' strike.
   Robert McCrindle, a lawmaker for the governng Conservative
Party, on Sunday blamed the Civil Aviation Authority for the
delays, and called for restrictions on night traffic to be lifted
at Gatwick, the world's busiest charter airport.
   The director of the London-based Air Transport Users Committee,
a consumer advocacy group, Monday echoed McCrindle's call for night
flights at Gatwick.
   ``The good of the many must override the interests of the few,''
said Richard Botwood.
   The chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Christopher
Tugendhat, denied charges of CAA complacency and blamed last week's
problems on a lack of inter-European cooperation.
   ``If all air traffic controllers in Europe and all air traffic
control systems had been working with the same efficiency and
dedication last week as ours have, this position would not have
arisen,'' he said.

   The newborn found abandoned in a jetliner
restroom will remain in county custody at least until Friday, a
juvenile court commissioner ruled Monday, rejecting the father's
effort to obtain custody.
   The parents of 5-day-old Alyssa Frances LoCasto, Louis and
Christina LoCasto of New York City, attended the closed hearing but
declined to talk with reporters. Christina LoCasto, 24, has pleaded
innocent to a felony charge of child endangerment.
   Vicki Yeley, Louis LoCasto's lawyer, said the couple decided
over the weekend to remain together, and that decision was one
reason why Juvenile Court Commissioner Patricia Bresee decided
against placing the child in her father's custody.
   ``Mr. LoCasto is very much in love with his little daughter,''
Yeley said. ``He is also very much in love with his wife. The
family has made a decision to stay together. They are determined to
remain united.''
   The commissioner asked both LoCastos and a court-appointed
attorney representing the baby, Gerry Hilliard, to return to court
Friday after the San Mateo County Department of Social Services
compiles a report on possible homes for Alyssa.
   Until then, the couple will be allowed to visit their infant
daughter under the county's supervision.
   Mrs. LoCasto is accused of delivering the baby in the bathroom
of a San Francisco-bound United Airlines jet shortly before takeoff
from Newark, N.J., last week, and leaving the child under the sink,
wrapped in a bloody towel.
   She was released from custody after posting $50,000 as bail. If
convicted, she faces up to six years in prison.
   The LoCastos, who have been married since 1986, had planned to
vacation in California with their other two children when the
incident occurred.
   The infant, 8 pounds 9 ounces at birth, will remain in a foster
home until at least Friday.
   She was released Saturday from Mills Memorial Hospital in San
Mateo, 15 miles south of San Francisco, where she was taken after a
custodian found her on board the plane. She is under the
supervision of the San Mateo County Child Protective Services.
   Hilliard said Alyssa ``appears to be a normal 5-day-old ...
suffering no ill effects from what occurred'' despite spending six
hours in the restroom.
   Hilliard asked Bresee to keep Alyssa in the custody of the
Department of Social Services for the time being, but said he was
unsure what position he would take on Friday, when the report would
be presented.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge set a Jan. 3 trial date Monday
for three men charged with racketeering in the Wedtech scandal,
assuring that the potentially embarrassing testimony about the
bankrupt defense contractor would not come until after the
presidential election.
   Prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Richard Owen for an
earlier date, but the defense said it needed more time and one
defense attorney said he would be tied up in other trials until
early December.
   The defendants are attorney E. Robert Wallach, 53, a longtime
friend of Attorney General Edwin Meese III; financial consultant W.
Franklyn Chinn, 45; and R. Kent London, 44, a Chinn business
associate.
   Wallach, Chinn and London are charged with extracting millions
of dollars from Wedtech, a now bankrupt defense contractor, to
influence Meese and other officials. All three have pleaded
innocent.
   Wallach introduced Meese to Chinn, a former Wedtech board
member, and urged him to invest with Chinn.
   Meese was not charged with any wrongdoing in the 18-count
federal indictment and a special prosecutor in Washington, while
critical of the attorney general's conduct regarding Wedtech and
other matters, decided there was insufficient evidence to indict
him.
   Meese, saying the special prosecutor's investigation vindicated
him, plans to leave office by early August.
   The trial was delayed by a legal wrangle over government
attempts to freeze Chinn's assets, including money he needed to pay
his defense lawyers. Prosecutors wanted his property attached to
guarantee their availability for seizure proceedings if Chinn were
convicted.
   But late last month, Owen ruled that the money and property the
government sought to freeze were not subject to forfeiture.
   Another Wedtech-related racketeering trial involving U.S. Rep.
Mario Biaggi, a Democrat; Wedtech founder John Mariotta; and five
others is nearing completion at federal court in Manhattan.

<HEAD>ABC News Convention Eve Poll: Bush 46, Dukakis 45</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush drew 46 percent
support to 45 percent for Michael Dukakis in a national public
opinion poll taken on the eve of the Democratic National
Convention, ABC News reported Monday.
   The ABC survey of 458 registered voters showed no immediate help
to Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis from his choice of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas as his running mate. Most respondents were aware of the
choice but were unfamiliar with Bentsen.
   The one-day poll conducted Sunday had a smaller sample than most
national surveys and thus a higher margin of error, plus or minus
five points. Other poll results this month have ranged from a dead
heat to an 11-point Dukakis lead.
   ABC noted that it was Bush's first numerical lead in the
network's polls since September. A USA Today-Cable News Network
survey July 6-10 had it 47 percent for Bush and 44 percent for
Dukakis, also a tie statistically.
   Almost three-quarters in the ABC poll said they did not know
enough about Bentsen to be able to give an opinion of him, and
nearly as many said his selection would have little impact on their
vote.
   It was the first national poll since Bentsen's selection. Two
new polls in Bentsen's home state showed the ticket drawing even
with Bush there; earlier, Dukakis alone trailed badly in most Texas
polls.
   A strong majority in the ABC poll, 68 percent, said they
believed the Democratic ticket would be helped by Jesse Jackson's
enthusiastic support. But another measure indicated that Jackson's
influence could be slight: while 30 percent said they would be more
likely to support a candidate he endorsed, 27 percent said they
would be less likely.
   Just 35 percent said they expected Jackson to work
enthusiastically for Dukakis, while 46 percent expected him to
support the ticket reluctantly and 12 percent expected him to
remain on the sidelines. The poll, however, was completed before
Dukakis and Jackson met Monday and pledged cooperation.
   Respondents were split on what role Jackson had earned as well
as on what role he likely will play this year. A third said he
``deserves to play a major role'' in determining the party's future
direction this year, a third said he deserved ``some role'' and 22
percent chose ``only a small role.''
   In the presidential horse race, the poll found Dukakis losing
ground with independents, moving from a 44-44 split last week to a
35-52 disadvantage.
   It also said Dukakis' favorable-unfavorable rating had moved
slightly, from 59-23 last week to 56-24. Bush's unfavorable rating
remained higher but improved a bit, from 41 percent to 36 percent.
   The poll also indicated a narrowing of the gender gap. While
Dukakis still led Bush among women, it was by a 9 point gap, half
that of the ABC poll earlier in July.

   Robert Farmer, director of Michael Dukakis' fund
raising during the primary season, promised Democrats on Monday
they will have plenty of money for their fall campaigns.
   ``The Republicans have always been able to raise enormous
amounts of money for their campaigns. Now, for the first time, we
can compete,'' Farmer told the Democratic National Convention.
   ``It's a good feeling, and it's a whole new ball game,'' Farmer
said. He said participation of more than 100,000 contributors
nationwide has created ``the closest thing to a level financial
playing field in a presidential election that I've seen in my
lifetime.''
   Farmer, a former Republican and founder of a successful
educational publishing company in Boston, served as finance
director for the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Democrat
John Glenn in 1984.
   After meeting Dukakis, Farmer raised funds for his 1986
gubernatorial re-election campaign and served as treasurer of the
Dukakis presidential campaign from the start in early 1987.
   During the primary season, Farmer raised a record $21 million,
triggering the addition of some $9 million in federal matching
funds and giving Dukakis a consistent advantage over his rivals.
   For the fall, the Dukakis staff has joined forces with the
Democratic National Committee to work for the Democratic Victory
Fund for the presidential campaign and races at all levels.
   Farmer was introduced by Jim Calaway of Texas, the Victory Fund

the whole record of fund raising.''
   For the first time, Calaway said, the party was committed to

effort yielded $12 million, 50 percent more than the original goal.

   A Navy helicopter vanished after a pair of
powerful explosions over open sea Monday and searchers feared all
eight crew members were killed, military officials said.
   An extensive search of the fog-shrouded area off the San
Francisco shore turned up seven empty flight helmets and other
debris, but no sign of the crew, Coast Guard officials said.
   ``There's still no sign of survivors, but we're hoping and
looking. We expect the search to continue throughout the night,''
said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jack Hardin.
   Names were being withheld until the Navy finishes notifying
relatives of the missing crew members, a spokesman said.
   The crew of a private vessel, the Northern Lights, reported they
heard two explosions about 11 a.m. and then ``saw the helicopter
disappear from the sky'' 11 miles west of the Golden Gate, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Thomas Cowan.
   The helicopter was involved in a mine-detection exercise, the
Navy said.
   The disaster prompted the Coast Guard to close the Golden Gate
to ships for about a half-hour.
   ``Initially we had some reports there were explosives on the
helicopter.'' said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Ken Freeze. ``It
turned out they were pyrotechnics _ flares _ and small arms
ammunition, which poses no threat to shipping.''
   Meanwhile, two Navy helicopters and two Coast Guard choppers
joined the cutter Blackhaw, two smaller Coast Guard vessels and the
Northern Lights in the search.
   But the search was complicated by dense fog that reduced
visibility to 150 yards, Cowan said.
   Although the Coast Guard expected the search to continue through
the night, the Blackhaw _ already at sea when the explosion
occurred _ could remain out for several days, said Petty Officer
Dave Anderton.
   Navy spokeswoman Virginia Felker said the helicopter was
attached to Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15, based at Alameda
Naval Air Station on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay.
   She said the helicopter was conducting a routine mine
countermeasure operation using radar and ``sledge'' that is towed
through the water.
   Navy spokesmen at the Pentagon said the helicopter was an MH-53E
Sea Dragon, a version of the H-53 Sea Stallion outfitted for
minesweeping.
   The MH-53E Sea Dragon and its sister aircraft, the CH-53E Super
Stallion, are described by the Navy as the largest helicopters in
the West. They are 99 feet long with the rotors turning, weigh
73,500 pounds and can travel at 150 knots.
   The helicopter is manufactured by the Sikorsky Aircraft Division
of the United Technologies Corp.

   The U.N. secretary-general held talks with
Iraqi and Iranian diplomats on a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war
after Iran announced its acceptance of a truce earlier Monday in a
surprise policy reversal.
   Iran's announcement was widely seen as a breakthrough toward
ending the war, which has claimed an estimated 1 million lives
since it began in September 1980. The Tehran government, battered
by a series of recent military defeats, said it will accept the
U.N. truce resolution without condition.
   Iran informed U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar of
its decision in a letter from President Ali Khamenei late Sunday
night.
   The letter cited the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner with
290 people aboard on July 3 as a major reason for Iran's sudden
welcoming the U.N. olive branch.
   ``If I'm lucky, I may have a cease-fire in a week to 10 days,''
Perez de Cuellar told a news conference.
   ``I intend ... to start my consultations to begin to set up a
D-Day for the implementation for the resolution,'' he said.
   He announced he would begin discussions at once with the
ambassadors from Iran and Iraq on the Security Council Resolution
598, which was adopted July 20, 1987. The resolution demands an
immediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, followed by a troop
withdrawal.
   It also calls for a prisoner exchange, an impartial commission
to determine responsibility for the conflict and a comprehensive
peace plan.
   The measure authorizes the secretary-general to set up an
impartial body to determine which side started the war.
   Perez de Cuellar later met separately with Ambassadors Mohammad
Ja'afar Mahallati or Iran and Ismat T. Kittani of Iraq. No word
emerged as to results.
   Perez de Cuellar said he would assemble a 10-member team and
another force of at least 250 U.N. military observers to monitor
the cease-fire and troop withdrawal. He said he would send a second
team to both countries at the end of the week to work on an early
prisoner exchange.
   The secretary-general called the U.S. downing of the Iranian
airliner a ``catalyst'' in prompting Iran's decision.
   Iraq's information minister, Nassif L. Jassem, said Iran
appeared to be accepting the resolution ``for tactical reasons''
and not out of any desire for a ``real and just peace.''
   Khamenei's letter, citing the airliner downing, said the war is
``engulfing innocent civilians.''
   ``In this context, we have decided to officially declare that
the Islamic Republic of Iran _ because of the importance it
attaches to saving the lives of human beings and the establishment
of justice and regional and international peace and security _
accepts the (U.N. resolution),'' it said.
   The counselor of the Iraqi U.N. Mission, Mudhafar A. Al-Amin,
told reporters: ``The significance of it really ... is that it's
about time that Iran realized there should be an end to the war ..
. with no victors and no vanquished.
   ``Iran should seize the opportunity and make peace.''
   Britain's U.N. Ambassador, Sir Crispen Tickell, told reporters:
``It's far too soon to celebrate. We made a step forward in that
letter and I hope the secretary-general now will be able to advance
to something that brings this horrible war to an end.''
   Iraq had said earlier that it would accept the U.N. resolution
only if Iran also did so, but Iran held back, demanding that Iraq
be branded the aggressor as a condition to any peace settlement.
   With its acceptance, Iran appears to have backed away from
seeking the condemnation of Iraq as the price for a cease-fire.
   ``I don't see any conditions, any preconditions in this
letter,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   ``The resolution is a peace plan,'' he said, ``and it covers all
aspects. It is fully implemented, I think it means an end of the
conflict.''
   The announcement came hours before the Security Council was to
reconvene Monday to discuss the U.S. downing of the airliner. Iran
was unable to collect enough votes to condemn Washington and the
council adjourned Monday without a vote. The Security Council was
to discuss the issue Tuesday.
   Perez de Cuellar also noted that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said over the weekend that Iraq would not retain Iranian territory
taken in the war.
   He also said withdrawal of U.S. and other warships from the
Persian Gulf was not part of a peace plan and said he cannot order
ships to withdraw.
   But he said that with a cease-fire in place, all countries will
have to contribute to an atmosphere of ``detente.''
   Asked if a troop withdrawal would take place in the near future,
Perez de Ceullar said, ``We must first obtain that the parties
accept an immediate cease-fire.''
   Perez de Cuellar said he was ``a little surprised by the
timing'' of the Iranian announcement, but that he and U.N.
officials were impressed with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar
Velayati's restraint in his meetings last week.
   Last week Velayati addressed the Security Council and gave a
detailed account of the airliner tragedy and called for the
Security Council to condemn the U.S. action.
   Vice President George Bush defended U.S. policy and said the
plane was shot down in self-defense because the crew thought it was
an Iranian F-14. But he emphasized the need for peace and called on
Iran to accept Resolution 598 and end the war which led to U.S.
presence in the gulf.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee was cheered by
supporters of his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination when he appeared Monday at a sweltering barbecue given
in his honor.
   Acknowledging the accolade, Gore grinned and said, ``You thought
you were going to be able to do that on the convention floor,
didn't you?''
   He urged his supporters to work hard for Michael Dukakis, who
has the nomination locked up, and his designated vice presidential
running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Gore put his campaign on hold April 21 after finishing last in
the New York primary. But he said he hoped people would ``say a
long, long time from now that the 1988 Gore campaign contributed to
a revitalization of the Democratic Party.''
   Gore's mother, Pauline Gore, said she was not unconcerned
whether her son ever becomes president.
   ``I'm the mother of a nice young man and I'm proud of him,'' she
said. ``What could be better than being senator from Tennessee?''
   Mrs. Gore's husband, former Sen. Albert Gore Sr., 80, was
shaking hands as if he were running for office again. ``I'll bet I
shook hands just as fast as I could for two solid hours,'' he said.
   Like the old days?
   ``A little,'' grinned the elder Gore.

   Former President Carter says Vice President
George Bush has a ``silliness problem'' aggravated by leaving ``a
kind of effeminate impression'' that could cause serious problems
in his bid for the presidency.
   Bush has not made his positions clear to the public and has been
``wildly flexible in his basic philosophical stance during the last
dozen years or more,'' Carter said in an interview with the
suburban Gwinnett Daily News.
   ``People don't even know where he's from. He claims several
states,'' Carter said.
   ``Bush's effort at trying to improve his image contributed to
the silliness problem,'' the former president said. ``There's a
kind of effeminate impression that he gives to the public when he's
on television, trying to be tough when he isn't.''

   Actor Ed Asner and civil rights activist Coretta
Scott King threw their support Monday behind a campaign against
handguns led by New Jersey Senate President John Russo, whose
father was killed by a handgun.
   ``We're engaged in more than a symbolic gesture,'' said Mrs.
King, widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. who was
assassinated 20 years ago. ``This is the start of a new struggle _
a struggle to restore sanctity to human life.''
   Said Asner: ``There's no advantage to having a gun.''
   Russo is sponsoring legislation that would ban most handgun
sales in New Jersey by virtually abolishing permits to carry them.
   ``Let the word go forth that the battle for handgun control
begins today with a new force of momentum and a new commitment to
success,'' said Russo.

Center for Nonviolent Social Change before the opening session of

<HEAD>Disabled Delegates Call For Improved Access to Future Conventions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Disabled delegates to the Democratic National
Convention said Monday that they hope access to future conventions
will be improved.
   Delegates Tom Isaac, a member of the Aspen, Colo., City Council,
and Michael Ehrlichmann of Minneapolis, an activist for disabled
people, proposed creating a permanent disability office within the
Democratic National Committee.
   They also asked that future nominating conventions and party
meeting sites meet codes for improving access for the disabled, and
that the disabled be given permanent seats on the party's
convention site and arrangements committees.
   Disabled convention delegates are lobbying for a campaign
platfoarm that would endorse legislation barring discrimination
against disabled people in housing, employment, transportation,
education and access to public services and facilities.
   Rep. Tony Coelho of California, who is sponsoring such a bill,
and Edward M. Kennedy Jr., who lost a leg to cancer, were among
those who addressed the disabled caucus.
   Coelho, who is an epileptic, described the discrimination he has
endured. ``We've got to stop this thing, that because somebody has
epilepsy or a disability, we've got to be ashamed of them,'' he
said.

   The U.S. military stepped up
security at a U.S. Air Force base after a gunfire and grenade
attack injured six American soldiers, U.S. officials said.
   The servicemen were among a group of nine off-duty soldiers who
were attacked early Sunday as they left a discotheque in San Pedro
Sula, about 125 miles northwest of the capital of Tegucigalpa, a
Honduran police report said.
   Three gunmen hurled a grenade and fired M-16 rifles on the group
from a car, the report said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   In Washington, the Pentagon identified five of the wounded as:
Elbert Whitehead, an Army specialist from Enfield, N.C.; James
Jones, Army specialist, of Ebensburg, Pa.; Air Force Staff Sgt.
Shawn Cunningham, of Cheshire, Conn.; and Air Force Sgt. Michael
Shea of Gardena, Calif. and Army specialist John Monroe of Spring
Lake, Mo.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood said the name of the sixth
person injured was not released pending notification of family.
   Earlier reports said four men were wounded, but doctors at
Palmerola said another man was hit by shapnnel and a sixth injured
an ankle.
   A U.S. military spokesman in Honduras, Air Force Capt. Pat
Englehart, said the five servicemen were hospitalized and were
``doing very well'' late Monday. She said a sixth needed no
hospital treatment. She did not elaborate.
   The injured men were among 150 servicemen on a one-day
recreation leave from Palmerola Air Force Base. Following the
incident, all were recalled to the air base as a precaution, Wood
said.
   The soldiers, on leave from Palmerola, 41 miles northeast of
Tegucigalpa, wore civilian clothes and carried no weapons when
attacked, according to U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Barclay.
   ``Palmerola is not in a state of alert. Only its security
measures have been increased in the past 30 hours,'' Barclay said.
   Embassy officials would not elaborate on what steps had been
taken at the Palmerola, which is the headquarters for U.S. military
operations in Honduras.
   After the attack, the servicemen fled in a rented van, with
three of the van's wheels damaged by bullets, according to the
police report.
   ``They went toward the northern part of the city but had to park
at a milk products factory because the driver was hurt,'' it said.
The assailants pursued them and remained at the factory about five
minutes, then fled, according to the report.
   A night watchman, identified as Jose Maria Perez, hid the
servicemen in the guardhouse at the entrance to the plant,
according to newspaper accounts. He then called police and the Red
Cross.
   Embassy spokeswoman Anne Sigmund would not confirm the details
of the police report. She and Barclay said only that an explosive
device and small weapons were used in the attack.
   The Pentagon said there were 10 or 12 attackers.
   The attack was one of the most serious since tension began
building this year over the U.S. military presence in the Central
American country, which is also has been used as a base by
U.S.-supported rebels fighting the government of Nicaragua.
   The United States has maintained troops in Honduras since the
leftist Sandinistas seized power in neighboring Nicaragua in 1979.
   About 1,100 U.S. troops are stationed at Palmerola and others
visit for training exercises, military construction work and other
projects.
   At least 30 American soldiers in Honduras have been killed or
wounded in accidents or incidents of violence since the United
States began joint military maneuvers with the Honduran military in
1982.
   Anti-American protests broke out in April following the
deportation to the United States of Juan Ramon Matta, who was
wanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges and for
questioning in the 1986 slaying in Mexico of U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   The Honduran Constitution forbids the deportation of Honduran
nationals.
   Demonstrators burned the U.S. Consulate and U.S. Information
Service office in the capital to protest Matta's deportation and
the U.S. military presence in Honduras. The violence prompted the
government to temporarily impose a state of emergency restricting
civil liberties.

<TEXT>
   The military chief of
Nicaragua's rebel movement, Col. Enrique Bermudez, was elected
overwhelmingly Monday to the political directorate of the exile
Nicaraguan Resistance Assembly.
   He overcame criticism within the U.S.-backed rebels, known as
Contras, that giving political power to a military man would taint
the movement's democratic image.
   The 56-year-old professional soldier, a former colonel in the
Nicaraguan National Guard under the late dictator Anastasio Somoza,
was elected to the seven-member directorate by an overwhelmingly
majority of 44-2.
   Three assembly members abstained and five were absent when the
vote was taken on the second day of the assembly's three-day
meeting in this Caribbean capital.
   Bermudez was unopposed as an independent candidate and needed
only a simple majority of 28 to secure a one-year term on the
Miami-based political directorate.
   To enthusiastic applause from assembly delegates, Bermudez
pledged to unify the exile movement, which has been fractured by
internal feuding and has been struggling to stay financially afloat
since the U.S. Congress halted military aid to the Contras last
February.
   ``Today, more than ever, I offer my spirit and goodwill ... to
strengthen our movement,'' Bermudez said. ``To our Marxist-Lenist
enemy, we promise a hard battle.''
   Under the assembly's laborious voting procedure, assembly
members are called one by one to cast secret ballots. Polling
continued into the night for the other six directorate seats.
   Critics of the charismatic colonel said Bermudez was bent on
assuming both military and political control of the Contras, a
charge he denied.
   Although all seven members of the directorate have equal power
under assembly rules, senior director Adolfo Calero was widely
regarded as the movement's de facto political head.
   Calero was elected to one of the seven postions later Monday
night over challenger Fernando Aguero Rocha, 36-16. The remaining
two delegates simply voted ``no'' against Calero.
   Calero has said he will try to work with Bermudez if it becomes
necessary.
   The five earlier directors of the assembly were made up of
exiles representing political, business and labor groups in
Nicaragua. All sought re-election. Two seats on the directorate
were vacant.
   A former official of the assembly earlier Monday said one
possible compromise was that Bermudez would keep his title as
military commander and become a quasi-defense minister for the
traditionally all-civilian directorate, representing only the
interests of the military.
   Nicaragua now is ruled by a leftist Sandinista government.
Somoza, the last of a family dynasty, was overthrown in July 1979
by the Sandinista revolution.
   A cease-fire has been observed in Nicaragua since April, with
occasional violations.
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, one of the two directors opposed to
Bermudez, said talk of making him a defense minister was a ``mask''
for his attempt ``to take total control of the directorate.''
   ``I am concerned for the overall image of the movement,''
Chamorro said. ``It's a totally anti-democratic situation.''
   Chamorro and Calero tried to strip Bermudez of his military
command when he fired six regional commanders in Nicaragua in April
for lack of discipline. They were outvoted by directors Aristides
Sanchez, Alfredo Cesar and Azucena Ferrey.
   Bermudez insisted he was trying to reorganize and unify the
resistance movement, denied any desire for personal power and said
he sought only to give political voice to the guerrillas fighting
in Nicaragua.
   Sanchez, the colonel's closest ally on the directorate,
dismissed suggestions that it was incompatible for a movement
seeking democracy in Nicaragua to have a military man as its leader.
   The said the 7-year-old war against President Daniel Ortega's
government is ``an armed struggle for democracy'' and he does not
think Bermudez would taint the resistance movement's image. ``The
image is always good if the cause is legitimate,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A syndicated-TV crew unwittingly videotaped
the latest heist by the ``Beverly Hills Ponytail Bandit'' and the
recording may help in the investigation of his string of robberies,
the FBI said Monday.
   The crew captured the crime for the show, ``Great Weekend,'' at
a California Federal Savings bank branch, FBI spokesman Fred Reagan
said.
   ``They have been in touch with the FBI and agreed to share it
with us for investigative purposes,'' he said.
   The robbery occurred about noon Saturday as the show's
four-person crew taped a story about checking accounts, said Sandra
Manning, a spokeswoman for the Sunrise News production company,
which produces ``Great Weekend.''
   ``No one knew what was going on,'' Ms. Manning said. ``We even
did two more takes. It seemed just like another transaction.''
   The videotape revealed the robber in the background behind a
bank spokesman. Although a close inspection of the tape showed what
appeared to be a weapon being drawn, the teller who faced the
robber betrayed no sign that anything out of the ordinary was
taking place.
   The TV people realized a crime had been committed after the
robber left the bank and alarms were set off.
   The robber is thought to be responsible for nine robberies in
Beverly Hills, West Los Angeles and Santa Monica since June 10,
Reagan said, adding, ``He possesses a weapon, makes oral demands
and carries a bag for the money.'' Other tapes from bank cameras
have shown the man to be the same, Reagan said. FBI agents have
dubbed him the ``Beverly Hills Ponytail Bandit'' because he has a
short ponytail, Reagan said. No one has been injured during any of
the robberies, Reagan said. He was unsure how much money has been
taken.
   ``Great Weekend'' appears on 70 stations around the country.

   President Reagan on Monday signed

   Under a 1986 law, boards had until Oct. 12 to draft plans to

cancer-causing fibers into the air.
   The bill permits governors to extend the deadline until May 9
and does not change the July 9, 1989 deadline by which plans must

from Palm Beach to Clearwater ditched in Tampa Bay, a spokesman
said.
   No one was seriously injured.
   The small plane was headed for St. Petersburg-Clearwater
International Airport when a problem developed.
   Pilot Wayne Konga radioed an alternate plan to land at Albert
Whitted Airport in St. Petersburg but ditched about two miles
southwest of the field, said Petty Officer Chuck Rose.
   The Coast Guard dispatched two boats and a helicopter. Eight
minutes after the call came in, the Coast Guard pulled the seven
from the water, Rose said.
   ``They had some bumps and bruises and a sprain or two, but no
one required hospitalization,'' Rose said.
   The others on the plane were identified as pilot's wife, Linda
Konga, and her two small children, whose names were not given;
Patricia Karlik; Jerry Karlik; and Dianne Burkammer, all of
Clearwater. No ages were given.

   Who's that sweating reporter with the thick shock
of salt-and-pepper hair, wearing pinstripes and scribbling on a
white legal pad? It's Gary Hart, who was the early front-runner as
the race for the Democratic presidential nomination got underway.
   Hart, who quit the presidential race after a newspaper disclosed
his relationship with a model, is covering the convention for a
newspaper chain and Italian television.
   ``I'm grateful to be alive and to be here,'' Hart, a former
Colorado senator, told reporters Monday. And no, he is not
resentful at having to leave the race at a time when he was
considered the odds-on favorite to win.
   In a speech on the opening night of the convention, Democratic
Party Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. recognized all of those who had
tried for the party's nomination _ with the exception of Hart.
   Hart is writing columns for the 21 Scripps Howard newspapers and
330 others that subscribe to the Scripps Howard News Service. He
also is providing commentary for an Italian network.
   ``We went to him ... he said, `sure,''' said Dan Thomasson, vice
president and Washington bureau chief for Scripps Howard.
   Hart said he is writing ``very impressionistic things about my
own thinking about politics.''
   One of those impressions, he said, is that ``everybody at the
convention keeps their sights too low .... That's a feeling I've
had about politics for a long time.''
   For example, Hart said, trailing cameras and reporters around
the convention press hall, ``it's not important that Lloyd Bentsen
is from Texas but can he run the country.''
   Bentsen, a Texas senator, has been picked by Michael Dukakis,
the presidential nominee-to-be, as his running mate.
   Hart retired from the Senate to run for president and was
leading the Democratic pack last year until the Miami Herald
disclosed his liaisons with Miami model Donna Rice. He subsequently
re-entered the race for the nomination but never recovered his old
support and quit again in the middle of the primary season.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules FCC Cannot Ban `Indecent' Messages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Monday that federal regulators
may not ban ``indecent'' messages from phone lines, giving a
``dial-a-porn'' service half of a legal victory.
   But U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima held off on deciding
whether the Federal Communications Commission may shut off more
explicit messages which fall under the legal definition of
``obscene.''
   Tashima issued a partial ruling from the bench after a hearing
on a lawsuit against a new government law banning sexually oriented
telephone messages. The law bans both indecent and obscene messages.
   The suit, filed in June by Sable Communications of California,
challenges the law as being overly broad and vague, harming free
speech and failing to provide the least restrictive way to keep
children from reaching such services.
   Sable Communications, an affiliate of New York-based Carlin
Communications Inc., is one of the country's largest dial-a-porn
providers.
   Pending the outcome here and another lawsuit in New York, the
government had agreed to delay enforcing the law until July 25,
said Robert Chesnut, an attorney for the Department of Justice. The
law was to take effect July 1.
   Sable attorney Richard Simon declined to comment after Monday's
hearing except to note that the first part of Tashima's ruling was
in his client's favor.
   Tashima said he would rule on the second part of Sable's
challenge by the end of the week.
   The law applies only to interstate dial-a-porn calls and those
in the District of Columbia.
   The Federal Communications Commission deems material
``indecent'' if it depicts or describes sexual or excretory organs
or activities in a patently offensive way.
   The commission, applying a Supreme Court test, considers
material to be ``obscene'' if it depicts sexual acts in a patently
offensive way, appeals to the prurient interest of an average
person and lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
   The challenged law does not distinguish between live and
recorded phone communications. It does not appear to apply to
party-line services. It provides for both criminal and civil
prosecution and carries penalties of up to $100,000 for each day of
violation and imprisonment of up to six months.
   Dial-a-porn is estimated to produce about $54 million a year in
revenue for providers and phone companies, according to the
Information Industry Bulletin.

<HEAD>Runcie Says Anglican Church In ``Unholy Conflict''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Anglican church worldwide is
under serious threat from an ``unholy conflict'' over women priests
and bishops, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said Monday.
   Runcie, spiritual head of the Church of England and leader of
the world's 70 million Anglicans, said a real threat to unity
remains whether Anglican bishops decide to support, oppose or just
evade the issue .
   ``There are real and serious threats to our unity and communion
and I do not underestimate them,'' he told 525 Anglican bishops
from 164 countries in a keynote speech.
   The bishops, assembled in Canterbury for the Lambeth Conference,
heard the speech on the first working day of their three-week
meeting in a specially converted gymnasium at the University of
Kent.
   ``I hope it won't dominate this conference, but we need to
recognize that our unity is threatened over the ordination of women
to the priesthood and episcopate in whatever we ultimately decide
to do,'' the archbishop said, reading an 18-page speech titled
``The Nature of the Unity We Seek.''
   Previous doctrinal struggles throughout church history had
always been resolved, however bitter the fight was, Runcie said.
   ``And yet, in and through such unholy conflict, the church
eventually, and never without difficulty, came to a common mind.
   ``Conflict can be destructive. It can also be creative. We are
not here to avoid conflict, but to redeem it. At the heart of our
faith is a cross and not, as in some religions, an eternal calm.''
   A minority of the 27 self-governing Anglican churches, including
the 2.5 million U.S. Episcopalians, Canada, New Zealand and Brazil,
have admitted women to the priesthood since 1977.
   Women's ordination overshadows the conference because the U.S.
Episcopal Church is preparing to appoint the first woman bishop and
many bishops say they cannot accept that.
   The conference, held every 10 years, has no legislative power
among Anglicans but as the senior consultative body it is highly
influential.
   The 1978 Lambeth Conference resolved that Anglican churches
should respect each other's decisions, effectively postponing a
decision on women priests.
   Runcie said the message from the Anglican communion at local
level around the world was still strong and enthusiastic.
   The Anglican Comunion was not about to dissolve, he said,
recalling that he told the policy-making General Synod of the
Church of England: ``It is a little early to be taking the covers
off the lifeboats and abandoning ship.''

   Here's a sampling of what news media abroad are saying about the
U.S. Democratic National Convention that began Monday in Atlanta:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The Guardian (liberal) on Dukakis:
   ``It is extraordinarily hard to explain why Michael Dukakis has
come so far, so fast. He's efficient and inoffensive, to be sure.
But he comes, in the new demography of American politics, from
entirely the wrong part of the country.
   ``He has no broad appeal, no wells of emotion to tap. His
evolving economic policies, in many respects, come straight out of
the Bush barrel. The Democratic unity he's put together _ huge
stroke of luck _ stems mainly from the final primaries when it was
him or Jesse (Jackson).
   ``Now, though, he has to begin defining why America _ and not
just the poor, old Democratic Party _ needs change. And that will
be far harder to do because, for the majority, the good times
continue to roll ... ''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The South African Broadcasting Corp. on the convention:
   ``South Africa is expected to feature prominently on the agenda
... A report from the city says the party's policy committee has
drafted a document that will be tabled for approval at the
convention.
   ``The draft proposes that South Africa should be declared a
terrorist state. Other proposals include an end to the official
American policy of constructive engagement (and) the imposition of
comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.''
   
   _ The newspaper Business Day on the Democratic platform:
   ``The Democratic Party convention is set to commit its
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to the harshest anti-SA (South
Africa) policies yet adopted by an American political party.''
   The paper described an ``uncompromisingly harsh manifesto'' of
the party pdescribes South Africa as a ``uniquely repressive
regime, ruthlessly deciding every aspect of public and private life
by skin color, engagin in unrelenting violence against its citizens
at home and promoting naked aggression against its neighbors.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FRANCE
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ The French daily Liberation provided its readers with five
pages of stories, photographs and graphics Monday setting the scene
for the Democratic Convention this week in Atlanta.
   Other national newspapers also offered extensive coverage, such
as three stories covering a full page in the conservative
broadsheet Le Figaro.
   The afternoon daily Le Monde published a front-page article on
the convention, noting that the choice of Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis has been clear for weeks.
   ``The enormous machine is about to be set in motion, but it is
an open secret that the machine doesn't have much of a purpose,
except for making images for television viewers,'' Le Monde began
its report from Atlanta.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WEST GERMANY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ West German news media on Monday previewed the Democratic
National Convention by focusing on Jesse Jackson.
   Most newspapers printed their previews on the inside pages, with
headlines such as ``What Jesse Wants and How To Win,'' in the
Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper, suggesting that for West Germans,
Jackson will be the main attaction.
   ``Jackson, the preacher, leads the struggle, grasps the dream,
and is making the tradition of freedom and civil rights come
true,'' said the leftist-leaning newspaper.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHILE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The conservative daily newspaper El Mercurio, Chile's largest,
said in an editorial Monday on Bentsen:
   ``Lloyd Bentsen is a moderate, rather conservative Senator. He
has a long and outstanding legislative trajectory ... His knowledge
of foreign policy is one of the factors that contributed to his
selection, because Dukakis' lack of experience in that field is
well known. His Texan origin has also been fundamental for his
selection. George Bush depends on the Southern voters to reach
victory in November, and, because of that, Bentsen's contribution
to the Democratic campaign is essential.''

<HEAD>Veteran NY Congressman Won't Seek 16th Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Samuel Stratton, the dean of New York's
congressional delegation and a 30-year veteran of the House of
Representatives, won't seek a 16th term in office, his son-in-law
said Monday.
   Stratton, a Democrat, has been reportedly under scrutiny in an
investigation of alleged fraud in Pentagon procurement but the
family spokesman, Roger Mott, said the 71-year-old congressman was
retiring because of illness.
   ``It's health, health, health,'' Mott, a former Stratton chief
of staff, told reporters at the congressman's office here. ``The
Pentagon thing was a gnat on an elephant's rear end.''
   Stratton, a long-time asthma sufferer, has been experiencing
additional fatigue in recent weeks and was warned by doctors last
Thursday that he shouldn't risk the rigors of another campaign and
two-year term in Washington, Mott said.
   ``The decision has not been an easy one to make but I do feel
based on the information provided to me by my doctors it is the
best course of action to take at this time,'' Stratton said in a
statement read by Mott.
   Stratton, the fourth-ranking Democrat on the House Armed
Services Committee, also heads the subcommittee on procurement and
military and nuclear systems.
   News reports last month indicated that he was one of a handful
of congressmen under scrutiny in the defense procurement
investigation, but that there wasn't enough evidence to make him a
formal target of the probe. He hasn't been charged or officially
linked to any wrongdoing.
   The conservative-leaning Stratton represents a firmly Democratic
district and hasn't been seriously challenged in years. In 1986, he
defeated James Joseph Callahan by 140,759 votes to 5,279 votes.
   Stratton was elected Schenectady city councilman in 1949, mayor
in 1955 and congressman in 1958.
   Democratic Party leaders in the four-county 23rd Congressional
District has selected state Assemblyman Michael McNulty to run for
Stratton's seat, said Albany County Democratic Party Chairman J.
Leo O'Brien.
   The Republican candidate for the seat is Peter Bakal.

   The 40th Democratic National Convention opened
Monday as the first smokeless political convention in history. It
was also one of the few that began without a single fight over
delegates or rules, strictly not in the Democratic tradition.
   But there was, from keynote speaker Ann Richards, the kind of
speech Democrats love. Heroes and villains.
   Her villains: Ronald Reagan who ``for eight straight years ...
has pretended to us that he cannot hear our questions over the
helicopter noise.'' George Bush who ``hasn't displayed the
slightest interest in anything we care about.''
   And the heroes: ``We want leaders like Jesse Jackson ... a
leader and teacher who can open our hearts and our minds and stir
our very souls.'' And Michael Dukakis whose calm hides an
impatience ``to unify this country and get on with the future.''
   The convention opened with cheers for defeated politicians. A
prolonged chant the first time Jackson was mentioned. A rousing
cheer for Geraldine Ferraro, the losing Democratic vice
presidential candidate in 1984.
   And Jimmy Carter, the president who came from this state, was
given a prime time slot to deliver his speech. Four years ago, he
was slipped in during the kiddie-movie TV hours when only hardcore
political junkies were watching.
   The convention was less than a half hour old, getting routine
business out of the way, when Jackson was mentioned.
   ``Jesse, Jesse, Jesse,'' went the chant.
   It happened when another black man, Speaker Leroy Irvis of the
Pennsylvania House of Representatives, told the convention that for
the first time in a quarter century no credential fights preceded
the convention.
   ``I am proud to be a Democrat,'' he said. ``I am proud because
my party, my Democratic Party, recognized that women had the right
to high office as well as men and we nominated a woman. I am proud
that the Democratric Party has seen the first serious contention by
a black man.''
   Said Irvis: ``One day there will be a Democratic man or woman
who will go to the White House and be president of the United
States of America.''
   Party Chairman Paul Kirk announced that there would be no
smoking in the hall. So far has politics come from the smoke-filled
rooms that used to dominate the craft that there was not a single
audible groan.
   One of the early introductions was for Dorothy Bush, the
71-year-old secretary of the Democratic Party, who called the roll
at conventions since 1944.
   She was introduced as ``the grand old lady of the Democratic
Party.''
   Her first roll call, at this her 12th convention. gave the 56
delegations a chance to cheer for their own states and to raise
red-white-and blue Dukakis posters.
   The American Samoa delegation held up signs saying ``Malofa''
and ``Malo'' _ two ways of saying hello. The women in the
delegation wore Puletasi, two piece native dresses.
   In the California delegation, Ed Begley Jr., the goofy surgeon
of television's St. Elsewhere, said he found his first convention a
lot better than being on TV.
   ``I would like to see Michael Dukakis in the White House and I
think we are going to do it,'' he said. ``I'm going to vote for
Dukakis all the way.''
   Begley, who was known for his wild shirts on the long-running
television program, was wearing a sedate suit and tie. On his lapel
was a ``No First Use'' sticker in support of the Jackson minority
plank that would commit the United States to never launch a nuclear
attack.

   Michael Dukakis declared Monday he hoped the
Democratic National Convention would provide ``a reflection of a
party that has its act together.''
   Dukakis was interviewed by television networks in his hotel less
than a mile from the hall where the Democrats opened their
convention.
   The presidential nominee-to-be watched the opening on television
and telephoned keynote speaker Ann Richards, Texas state treasurer,
to congratulate her on ``a great speech.''
   According to press secretary Dayton Duncan, Dukakis told Mrs.
Richards, ``What am I going to say on Thursday? You said it all.''
Dukakis will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday.
   He repeatedly emphasized his belief that the convention would
showcase a united party.
   ``We've got 4,000 very happy delegates at this convention
tonight,'' he told NBC.
   He acknowledged in an ABC interview that when the fight for the
nomination began he couldn't have predicted he would emerge the
winner.
   ``I don't think anyone who starts this long marathon knows he
can cross the finish line in first place,'' he said.
   Asked what sort of image he hoped the convention would project,
Dukakis said, ``Strong, united, progressive, fiscally responsible,
a reflection of a party that has its act together.''
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis paid his respects to former
President Jimmy Carter and also met with congressional leaders and
promised the nation would have ``a president and Congress that work
together.''
   After a brief midafternoon appearance at the Carter Presidential
Center, Dukakis returned to his hotel to work on the speech he will
deliver Thursday night when he accepts the presidential nomination.
   The Massachusetts governor said he had no plans to appear at the
convention hall prior to the final night.
   After a meeting that lasted nearly three hours, Dukakis and
rival Jesse Jackson emerged to deliver a strong signal that the
party convention would reflect Dukakis's goal of party unity.
   Dukakis said he wanted Jackson to ``play a major role in this
campaign.'' Jackson also talked unity and said he had no plans to
challenge the selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for the vice
presidential nomination.
   After his session with Jackson, Dukakis joined House Speaker Jim
Wright of Texas and Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia for a ceremony highlighting their support of legislation
that would require companies to give workers and communities 60
days' notice before shutting down plants.
   President Reagan cited the plant-closing legislation as the
principal reason he vetoed a trade bill last spring.
   The Democratic-controlled Congress now has separated the
plant-closing bill from the trade legislation and passed it
overwhelmingly.
   Dukakis joined Wright and Byrd for a convention-site ceremony in
which the congressional leaders signed the bill preparatory to
sending it to the White House, where Reagan is considered likely to
veto it again.
   ``It's the kind of bill we won't have to send to Mike Dukakis
twice,'' said Byrd.
   ``You not only will not have to be sending bills like this to me
twice,'' responded Dukakis ``I'm going to be proposing them with
you. ... We're going to have a president and Congress that work
together.''
   ``What you're seeing today is only a small sample of things to
come,'' he said.
   At a luncheon at the Carter Center, where the guests included
many former Democratic Cabinet officials and presidential aides,
Dukakis said, ``My vocation is public service and I am proud of
it.''
   He said if elected president, he would ``bring a commitment to
public service back to Washington, D.C.'' an attitude he contrasted
with what he called the Reagan administration's ``contempt for
public service and public enterprise.''

   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, in a highly
personal keynote address, told the Democratic National Convention
on Monday night that the Reagan administration had turned America's
working class into the forgotten class. ``We can do better,'' she
said.
   Ms. Richards recounted a letter from a Lorena, Texas mother of
three who said her family income of $50,000 a year makes life a
constant fiscal challenge.
   ``We're the people you see every day in the grocery store,'' Ms.
Richards said, quoting from the unidentified woman's letter. ``We
obey the laws, pay our taxes and fly our flag on holidays.
   ``We plod along, trying to make it better for ourselves and our
children and our parents. We aren't vocal anymore. I think maybe
we're too tired,'' the woman wrote. ``I believe people like us have
been forgotten in America.''
   Ms. Richards said the woman was right.
   ``Of course you believe you're forgotten. Because you have been.
This Republican administration treats us as if we were pieces of a
puzzle that can't fit together. They've tried to put us in
compartments and separate us from each other. Their political
theory is divide and conquer,'' she said.
   ``No wonder we feel isolated, confused. We want answers and
their response is that something is wrong with you,'' Ms. Richards
added. ``Well nothing's wrong with you ... that you can't fix in
November.''
   ``When it comes right down to it, this election is a contest
between those who are satisfied with what they have _ and those who
know we can do better,'' she said. ``That's what this election is
all about.''
   Using her trademark rapier wit, she singled out Vice President
George Bush, the probable GOP presidential nominee.
   ``For eight straight years George Bush hasn't displayed the
slightest interest in anything we care about. And now that he is
after a job that he can't get appointed to, he's like Columbus
discovering America. He's found child care. He's found education,''
she said.
   ``Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot
in his mouth,'' Ms. Richards said.
   She received a big laugh with her opening line, when she chided
Bush's claim that he is a Texan. He claims a Houston hotel suite as
his legal residence.
   ``I am delighted to be here with you this evening because after
listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to
know what a real Texas accent sounds like,'' said the Waco, Texas
native who speaks with a sure-enough Texas drawl.
   ``I want to announce to this nation that in a little more than
100 days, the
Reagan-Meese-Deaver-Nofziger-Poindexter-North-Weinberger-Watt-Gorsuch-Lavelle-St
ockman-Haig-Bork-Noriega-Geoge Bush-era will be over,'' she said to
sustained applause from the Democrats.
   Dukakis, who watched the speech on television, telephoned Ms.
Richards to congratulate her on ``a great speech.''
   According to press secretaqry Dayton Duncan, Dukakis told Mrs.
Richards, ``What am I going to say on Thursday? You said it all.''
Dukakis will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose keynote address four years ago
propelled him to national prominence, also had high praise for Ms.
Richards' effort.
   ``I think it was like lighting a fuse for these Democrats,''
Cuomo said from the NBC anchor booth where he watched the address.
``They're ready to go.''
   Ms. Richards had high praise for Michael Dukakis, to whom she is
committed, and for runner-up Jesse Jackson.
   She said Jackson ``can open our hearts and our minds and stir
our very souls. He's taught us that we are as good as our capacity
for caring.''
   She touted Dukakis as a man ``who knows that this country is on
the edge of a great new era.
   ``Behind his calm there's an impatience to unify this country
and get on with the future,'' Ms. Richards said.
   And she praised Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis' designated
running mate, as someone who ``understands America from the barrio
to the board room.''
   Ms. Richards also carried through on her promise to note the
importance of letting a woman make the keynote address. She noted
that former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, another Texan, was the
keynote speaker in 1976.
   ``Two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you
give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did
everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards in high
heels,'' Ms. Richards said.
   Ms. Richards, a 54-year-old divorced mother of four grown
children, spoke of being a grandmother, and of wanting to tell her
grand-daughter Lily ``how very lucky she is. That for all our
differences, we're still the greatest nation on this good earth.''
   ``I just hope _ like her grandparents and her great grandparents
before _ that Lily goes on to raise her kids with the promise that
echoes in homes across America: That we can do better.''

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Criticizes Reagan Administration For Withholding Funds</HEAD>

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Monday that America's refusal to pay its full share of U.N.
dues is crippling the efforts of the United Nations.
   Earlier Monday, the world body learned that Iran unconditionally
accepted a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in
the Persian Gulf war and a negotiated settlement, a step that the
United States had urged upon Tehran.
   ``It was evident that the United States looks to the United
Nations for action on a very wide range of international matters,''
Perez de Cuellar told reporters.
   ``Today they have one more reason for expecting assistance from
the United Nations, for being grateful to the United Nations for
the way in which the U.N. Security Council and the office of the
secretary-general worked for the outcome of today.''
   Last Friday, the secretary-general traveled to Washington to
meet President Reagan, Vice President and Republican presidential
candidate George Bush, and other senior officials.
   ``I did not receive assurances that the administration is
prepared to return to full funding,'' said Perez de Cuellar, ``nor
to send to the U.S. Congress the letter of determination required
by the latter for the early release of $44 million, which had been
approved as part of the United States' 1987 contribution.''
   The United Nations assessed America dues of almost $215 million
in 1988, one-fourth of the world body's regular budget, which
excludes special peacekeeping costs.
   The Reagan administration decided to pay only $144 million,
however, and has so far released only $100 million.
   Under a U.S. congressional budget amendment, the administration
must certify to Congress its satisfaction with three key issues at
the United Nations for the remaining $44 million to be released.
   The United States has been seeking a greater voice in the United
Nations' budget process and a 15 percent cut in staffing at the
United Nations. It also wants more Soviet civil servants put on
permanent rather than short-term U.N. contracts, so they will be
independent of Moscow's policies.
   ``The president said that the U.S. recognizes its obligations to
the U.N. but that further progress on reform (at the United
Nations) was necessary to meet the concerns of Congress, which the
administration shares,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Friday.
   Perez de Cuellar said Monday: ``This is a matter of considerable
disappointment since the full and punctual payment of assessed
contributions is a legal obligation under the charter, and the
(U.N.'s) financial crisis is caused largely by the United States
underpayment is crippling the function of the organization as a
whole.''
   America's unpaid bills to the United Nations, due to withheld
funds and underpayment of assessed dues, total almost $467 million,
accounting for the great majority of the United Nations' total cash
shortfall of $647 million on June 30, according to the latest
published budget document.
   Perez de Cuellar has said the world body would be unable to meet
its payroll and would have to shut down unless its financial crisis
is overcome.

   Jesse Jackson said Monday he will intensify his
efforts to help free the American hostages held in Lebanon in light
of promising signals from the announcement of cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   ``I've been making overtures in the last month. I'm going to
intensify them now and ... renew an appeal to Syria to help, renew
an appeal to Lebanon, renew an appeal to Iran to try to get the
American hostages returned,'' Jackson said in an ABC-TV news
interview from The Omni arena where the Democratic National
Convention is under way.
   ``I've talked, for example, to several Middle Eastern
ambassadors today,'' Jackson said later in a CBS News interview.
``I shall reach out to Lebanon and Syria and to other people I know
in the region.
   ``Hopefully we can seize this moment to make a breakthrough, to
make a very basic appeal to religious and political leaders to try
to gain the freedom of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon,'' he added.
   Jackson did not elaborate further on actions he was taking. In
the past he has said he was putting the word out through the
contacts he has in the region.
   At a news conference earlier in the day, Jackson had mentioned
that Iran announced its acceptance of a truce in te war, and said
he would hope that would be a positive sign ``to gain the
opportunity of freeing the American hostages.''
   Jackson has said that while he does not know where the hostages
are, he has contacts in the Middle East who might be able to make
such an appeal.
   The hostages are believed to be held by radical Lebanese groups
who have links to Iran.
   Iran's announcement was widely seen as a breakthrough toward
ending the war, which has claimed an estimated 1 million lives
since it began in September 1980. The Tehran government, battered
by a series of recent military defeats, said it will accept without
condition the truce resolution developed by the United Nations.

   The world celebrated jailed black South African
leader Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday Monday with music, prayer and
candles, but 30,000 free-Mandela cards collected in Britain wound
up in the South African Embassy's trash bin.
   Anglican Bishop Trevor Huddleston, president of the
Anti-Apartheid Movement, led Christians, Buddhist monks, a rabbi
and a Moslem scholar in prayers for Mandela at London's St. James
Piccadilly Church.
   A cake with 70 candles was on display and the 400 worshipers
signed a 70-square-foot birthday card. Also present were 25
activists who had marched about 600 miles from Glasgow, Scotland.
   Britain's Anti-Apartheid Movement said it left 25 boxes of cards
in the lobby of the South African Embassy on Trafalgar Square after
guards refused to accept them for relay to South African President
P.W. Botha.
   The boxes were kicked back into the street and then put in a
trash bin, said Karen Talbot, an Anti-Apartheid Movement
spokeswoman.
   Embassy counselor Henry Raubenheimer said the embassy only
accepted petitions that came by mail. ``They (the campaigners) said
they didn't want to take the boxes back and they couldn't lie
around so we put them in the dustbin,'' he said.
   In South Africa, the government banned birthday events for
Mandela, who has been in prison for nearly 26 years. The African
National Congress leader is serving a life term for sabotage and
conspiracy to topple white rule.
   Stoffel van der Merwe, the South African information minister,
said on state-run television Monday night the government does not
see its way clear to free Mandela ``at this stage.''
   Speaking in Afrikaans, the language of the white Afrikaners who
control the government, he said the Mandela case is reviewed
regularly.
   Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria, head of the U.N. Special Committee
against Apartheid, said in New York: ``How many more black South
Africans ... will serve undefined jail terms before the world
stands up to proclaim that enough is enough?''
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., where President Reagan is vacationing,
the White House pres office said Mandela ``is widely recognized as
the embodiment of black aspirations in South Africa.''
   ``While he and other political leaders remain in prison, South
African government plans for political reform are not likely to
gain any significant support from the black community,'' the
statement said.
   ``We renew our appeal to the government of South Africa to
release Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners.''
   In Lusaka, Zambia, where the African National Congress has its
exile headquarters, thousands of students marched and burned
effigies of President P.W. Botha of South Africa, President Reagan
and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. The students want
harsher U.S. and British economic measures imposed against South
Africa.
   Birthday celebrants in New York City went to Central Park for
five hours of dancing, singing and speeches beginning at about 3
p.m. Leading the entertainment was the black South African cast of
the Broadway show ``Sarafina!''
   In Paris, South African writer Breyten Breytenbach addressed a
gathering in front of the Notre Dame Cathedral organized by the
anti-racism group, SOS-Racism. A group of artists painted a
portrait of Mandela during the meeting, and a crowd of about 100
people was to blow out the ``70 candles of the struggle against
apartheid'' on a huge birthday cake.
   In a statement issued Sunday night, French President Francois
Mitterrand praised Mandela's courage, saying he had devoted his
life ``to the service of the ideals of justice, dignity and
liberty.''
   In New Delhi, India, on Monday, hundreds of people attended a
public meeting and concert in Mandela's honor. Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi, visiting Ankara, Turkey, sent a message
appealing for Mandela's release.
   In Santiago, Chile, about 20 demonstrators burned a South
African flag during a protest in front of the South African Embassy
calling for Mandela's release.
   Foreign ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and
Norway congratulated Mandela, and King Juan Carlos of Spain cabled
him expressing ``my sincere concern over the length of your
imprisonment.'' Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali also
sent a birthday message.
   North Korea and Czechoslovakia both announced they were awarding
medals to Mandela. Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent Mandela
a message on Sunday.
   A dozen Israelis demonstrated Monday at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion
Airport where the new South African ambassador to Israel, Johan
Viljoen, was arriving.
   Prime Ministers Bob Hawke of Australia and David Lange of New
Zealand joined visiting Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey in a
statement calling for Mandela's release and warning: ``There must
be a dawning of sanity in Pretoria if the worst is not to happen.''

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's involvement
with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project and scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. are to be detailed publicly in an 830-page report,
which is to be accompanied by a lengthy rebuttal from Meese's
lawyers.
   The report, to be issued today by a three-member panel of
federal appeals court judges, was compiled by independent counsel
James McKay after he concluded in a 14-month criminal investigation
that there is insufficient evidence to seek an indictment of Meese.
   McKay submitted his report July 5 under seal to the appeals
court panel which appointed him. Hours later, Meese declared he had
been vindicated and announced he would resign.
   Despite his impending departure from the Justice Department,
Meese's ties to the proposed pipeline and other matters may undergo
an ethics review by the department's Office of Professional
Responsibility.
   In addition to Wedtech and the pipeline, McKay's report delves
into Meese's decision on behalf of regional Bell telephone
companies at a time when he held $14,000 in phone stock.

   Discovery's tiny fuel leak has been
stopped but not fixed, and officials have decided to test-fire the
ship's three main engines before deciding whether to remove the
space shuttle from the launch pad for repairs.
   While preparing for that crucial July 28 test, engineers will
decide if there is a way to fix the difficult-to-reach leak on the
pad, whether the leak can be isolated from the fuel system or if it
is so insignificant that is does not pose a flight hazard if left
as is.
   ``By draining and purging the line, engineers have stabilized
the leak and feel it is safe to proceed with the flight readiness

   President Augusto Pinochet, evidently
seeking eight more years of rule, has toned down his authoritarian
image. In public appearances, he portrays himself as tender-hearted
as well as tough-minded.
   In addition, the right-wing army commander tries to present his
government as more democratic and participative. Political analysts
see it as a bid to win the electoral backing of many undecided
Chileans.
   ``I can't govern alone. I need you to help me,'' he told a group
of youths at a breakfast meeting in the southern city of Concepcion
during a question-and-answer session peppered with avuncular
observations and jokes.
   The government plans, by early October, a yes-or-no ballot on a
presidential candidate to be picked by the heads of the army, air
force, navy and national police. No specific date has been set and
no candidate yet named. But Pinochet, who as army chief will
participate in the selection, is seen as the probable nominee.

   Asian-Americans are better paid and better
educated than American whites, but a report by government civil
rights experts is reluctant to declare an ``Asian success story''
and insists that discrimination still exists.
   Presentation of the 289-page study to the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights, which had ordered it, prompted concern over its
impact. One commissioner, Mary Frances Berry of the University of
Pennsylvania, said it might lead to more discrimination when the
public realizes how much more Asians are earning.
   Six of the seven commissioners voted Friday to hold off on
adopting the document as an official government report until more
outside experts can review and interpret it.
   The study, billed as the first comprehensive look at the incomes
of nearly 4 million Asian-American residents, shows that
native-born American families with Chinese ancestry earn 50 percent
more than families in which both husband and wife are white, and
Korean and Japanese families earn 46 percent and 44 percent more,
respectively.
   But some Asian-American ethnic groups are not faring so well.

   Iran's acceptance of a truce in the war
with Iraq appears to be the work of Hashemi Rafsanjani, who
introduced a much less bellicose tone when he became military
commander last month.
   He hinted at a negotiated solution to the nearly 8-year-old
struggle and, after the U.S. Navy shot down an Iranian airliner
July 3, even cautioned against violent retaliation.
   Rafsanjani has built personal power through his job as speaker
of Iran's parliament, the Majlis.
   On June 2, after several Iraqi military victories, revolutionary
patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini made him commander-in-chief.
He has emerged as the man most likely to hold temporal power after
the death of Khomeini, who is 88.
   Rafsanjani, 53, said on Iranian television Monday that Khomeini,
who set the previous policy to reject a cease-fire, decided Sunday
to accept it.

   On the Sabbath, at Salem Baptist Church, The Rev.
Jesse Jackson considered the week to come and led a crowd of 1,300
in a chant that had become his convention rallying cry. ``Never
surrender,'' he implored. ``Never surrender.''
   That was Sunday.
   On Monday the convention dawned and Jackson unveiled a new, more
conciliatory chorus. He did not surrender, but with the gavel about
to fall, he faced reality and _ to use Michael Dukakis' language _
agreed to let the quarterback call the plays.
   Following the unity news conference between Dukakis and Jackson,
Jackson led 2,000 supporters and delegates in quite a different
cadence: ``Discipline, Details, Hope.''
   The summit allowed both men to declare victory, and for once
Dukakis got in the final word.

   Michael Dukakis is promising to wage war on
drugs, homelessness and poverty if elected president, but he isn't
saying how he would do that and still mop up all that ``Republican
red ink in Washington.''
   Dukakis has leavened traditionally liberal stands on health
insurance, education and Social Security with a commitment to
business-like efficiency in managing the affairs of government.
   His bedrock campaign vow is to preside over an economy that
provides ``good jobs at good wages for every citizen,'' and he
cites the turnabout in the Massachusetts economy over the past
decade as evidence of his capacity to occupy the chief executive's
mansion at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

   Those who frequent conventions to see and be seen
are facing a monumental challenge at this year's Democratic
gathering, where the only thing scarcer than podium time is floor
space inside the convention hall.
   The paucity of floor passes, even for high-ranking officials and
party operatives, has prompted party officials to convert the
Georgia World Congress Center across from The Omni into a giant
consolation prize of invitation-only parties and other events to
ease the pain of exile.

   Beneath a leafy plane tree at a cafe where

   ``Michalis'' is how Michael Dukakis is known to the 640 people

hometown, even though he was born in the United States.
   ``We don't want to shout about it, but the gut feeling here is
that Michalis will make it,'' said Costas Stefanou, the 42-year-old
president of the mountain village.
   Even though Dukakis has made only one visit here, in 1976 during
his first term as Massachusetts governor, he has been honored by
officials of the village on the island of Mytilene.
   In June, the six-member local council put up a sign outside town
that says in Greek and English: ``Welcome to the Hometown of
Michael Dukakis.''
   They also changed the name of the main street _ a cement strip
where dogs snooze and chickens wander _ from Athanassios Diakou to

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III probably
broke two tax laws and twice violated a criminal
conflict-of-interest statute, but won't be charged with a crime,
independent counsel James McKay concluded in an 814-page report
unveiled to the public on Monday.
   Meese reacted at a news conference by declaring he was outraged
and appalled by McKay's findings, saying that if Justice Department
lawyers had issued such a document ``they'd be fired.''
   In a report which concluded his 14-month investigation, McKay
wrote that ``A trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Meese violated'' a section of the
Internal Revenue Code by filing ``a materially false tax return.''
McKay added that Meese probably also violated a section of the
Internal Revenue Code for ``willfully failing to pay tax at the
time required by law.''

<HEAD>Gatherings of Former Nazis Still Common in West Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Nazi officers and soldiers
still get together regularly in West Germany and government
officials can do little to stop them.
   Officials say they check on such meetings only if they detect
concrete signs of extremist right-wing tendencies.
   Gatherings of ex-Nazis range from yearly reunions of former SS
officers to meetings of regular army veterans, many of whom once
belonged to the Nazi party.
   Other gatherings on formal occasions draw old battle comrades.
   The funeral in Duesseldorf for a former aide to Adolf Hitler,
for example, drew about 100 ex-members of the Nazi's Waffen SS, the
newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported.
   Many of the former SS men at the funeral July 8 wore the
insignia of an SS veterans' group, and draped the casket of the
former Hitler aide, Richard Schulze-Kossens, with wreaths bearing
tributes from several former SS units, the newspaper said.
   Afterwards the former SS men, now mainly in their 70s and 80s,
went out for coffee and talked about their health, Welt am Sonntag
said.
   ``We don't approve of it, but attending a funeral isn't
illegal,'' said Interior Ministry spokesman Roland Bachmeier.
   ``Such a gathering does not in fact pose much danger to
society,'' he added, referring to the relatively small numbers of
West Germans involved with extreme right-wing organizations.
   The total number of right-wing extremists is 25,200 in this
nation of 61.5 million people, according to Interior Ministry
statistics released in May.
   While it is illegal in West Germany to display Nazi symbols and
propaganda, and known neo-Nazi groups are banned, war veterans'
groups are legal.
   ``Unless we have concrete proof that a veterans' group is
involved in illegal activities, it is allowed to meet,'' Bachmeier
said.
   ``If we suspect that a group has right-wing extremist
tendencies, we keep a very close eye on it.''
   One of the most hotly protested reunions was one held by
hundreds of Waffen SS veterans in the Bavarian Alps town of
Nesselwang in May 1985.
   The reunion, held just before President Reagan's visit to a
military cemetary in Bitburg where 49 Waffen SS members are buried,
drew protests from church groups, labor union groups, and angry
citizens.
   Both the Nesselwang gathering and the Duesseldorf funeral,
according to Welt am Sonntag, included members of a veterans'
organization with many former SS members, known as HIAG, an acronym
for mutual aid society.
   The SS, or ``Schutzstaffel,'' was an elite military guard of the
Nazi Party. The Waffen SS was the fighting branch of the guard,
which also ran concentration camps and massacred civilians.
   Many West Germans, however, say they are outraged that such
meetings are allowed. They maintain that Nazi propaganda is spread
at many, if not all, reunion meetings _ even if it is not done in a
manner blatant enough to qualify as illegal.
   ``They spread propaganda that glorifies the war and even many of
Hitler's goals,'' said Kurt Faller, spokesman for the
communist-oriented League of Anti-Fascists.
   ``Young people attend these meetings, too, and get the idea that
what went on wasn't really so bad,'' he said. ``It's a scandal that
they're allowed to meet.''
   However, organized protests at reunion sites have led some
veterans' groups to act with more discretion in recent years,
Faller said.
   ``Organized protests at reunion sites have led them to be more
secretive about when and where they hold their meetings.''
   Protesters have included outraged citizens, Roman Catholic and
Protestant church groups, labor unions, and members of liberal
political parties, in addition to League of Anti-Fascists, Faller
said.

<HEAD>Restoration Puts Marcus Aurelius in Awkward Position</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marcus Aurelius is flat on his back, his noble horse
riderless, but the ancient Roman emperor seems to be taking the
indignity in stride, as a good Stoic philosopher should.
   Much more so than his caretaker of the last 7{ years, Alessandra
Melucco, who has directed the restoration of the 1,800-year-old
gilded bronze statue since its removal in 1981 from the center of
the Campidoglio, Rome's municipal square crowning the Capitoline
Hill.
   ``No pictures, please, of Marcus lying down,'' orders Melucco.
``Marcus doesn't want to be seen that way.''
   ``That way'' finds the emperor atop a pair of planks, his legs
attached to pulleys, and his mount a few yards away in a workroom
of Rome's Central Restoration Institute at San Michele, a former
monastery across the Tiber River from City Hall.
   By summer's end, the challenging restoration of rider and horse,
which have become a kind of symbol of Rome's ``eternalness,''
should be complete.
   But it looks as if the famous pair won't last much longer, let
alone an eternity, if they reclaim their perch atop their marble
pedestal, designed by Michelangelo, in the heart of Campidoglio
square, also the work of the Renaissance master.
   If worst fears come true, the emperor, who ruled from 161 to 181
A.D., won't even be able to remount his horse.
   The ages have taken their toll, especially the 20th century,
with its corrosive automobile pollution and unsettling traffic
vibrations.
   Deciding where the statue will wind up is like writing a
prescription ``for a sick man who has had a heart attack,'' says
Anna Sommella, director of archaeology for the Capitoline Museums,
which overlook the square.
   ``He can decide to live for only a short time but be like
everybody else and go outside, or he can decide he wants to last as
long as possible.''
   To last as long as possible, she explained, would mean shelter
in a museum for Marcus Aurelius, away from pollution and other
disagreeable aspects of Rome's outdoors.
   The city council will make the final decision after considering
the opinion of the restoration institute and museum personnel,
Sommella said.
   While the question is officially still open, the prescription
seems all but written. Marcus Aurelius and his steed, believed to
be cast in 176 A.D., appear destined for indoor life, with a copy
taking their place in the square.
   The top contender for the statue is the Senatorial Palace,
another Capitoline hill architectual treasure.
   Restorers began work in the spring of 1987 with lasers, scalpels
and brushes after three years of testing and a long pause for fund
raising. An insurance company paid more than half of the $825,000
cost.
   Melucco, the restoration director, says the operation has turned
up several problems that weigh on the statue's longevity.
   For example, in 1836, a then-illustrious group of Rome
archaeologists decided the statue was leaning and poured a mixture
of metals into one of the horse's legs to steady it.
   ``Instead it made it worse, and we found the metals could not be
removed,'' Melucco said.
   Three of the mount's legs touch ground but the fourth curves
gracefully in the air. Historians believe that until at least the
12th or 13th century, that fourth leg rested upon another statue,
whose fate is unknown.
   Moving Marcus around didn't help, either. Pope Paul III ordered
the monument moved to the Campidoglio in 1538 from the area of the
Lateran Palace, which had been a papal residence.
   Technicians are now testing to see how much stress the horse can
take to determine if Marcus Aurelius can eventually get back in the
saddle.
   Legend has it that when the equestrian statue's gilding
disappears, Rome will cease to exist.
   The gilding still shines on the faces of both rider and mount,
as well as around the imperial toga's collar and horse's saddle,
but Melucco says that only specks of that gold is the original
gilding.
   Other coats were put on over time, sometimes just a dab here and
there, and the various ages of the gilding complicate the task of
preservation.
   Tests also indicate that one out of every three days in Rome is
too humid for the monument's well-being. Varying daily temperatures
also could shorten the statue's longevity.
   The delicate interaction of bronze and gold have posed a so-far
unsolved challenge _ to concoct a coating to protect the
masterpiece from outdoor fpollution after restoration.
   ``Even though we see no hope now to put it back,'' Melucco said,
``we hope there will be the technology eventually and the will and
the environmental conditions to put it back.''
   In the meantime, she added, perhaps seeing a copy instead of a
masterpiece in the city square will ``serve as a reminder that our
people haven't met the needs'' of masterpieces assaulted by
pollution.

<HEAD>Matches Scarce as Price Reform Spurs Chinese to Hoard Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHANGHAI, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A thing so common as a match has become a
coveted item in Shanghai.
   ``For more than a month now one can't find matches,'' grumbled
Zhou Dachang, a retired economics professor.
   It's because the government's price reform program is sending
prices up and people are hoarding things whose prices they think
will go up.
   One Shanghai woman told the China Daily, the official newspaper,
that she'd bought up enough matches to last 20 years.
   The hoarding of everything from matches to fertilizer as prices
and black marketeering increase dramatically has tormented shoppers
as the growth-minded Communist leadership shakes up a price system
unchanged for nearly four decades.
   Zhou said this past spring saw a run on cotton in Shanghai,
China's biggest city with 12 million people, because of a false
rumor that its price was going up.
   Match prices did go up, however, from 2 fen (less than one U.S.
cent) a box to 3 fen, but the cost of wood rose faster and many
small factories closed. Match production dropped and hoarding began.
   Since the Communists took over in 1949, the state has set most
prices, often at subsidized, artificially low levels. After Deng
Xiaoping took over as the senior leader in 1978, the government
began to experiment with raising some prices and decontrolling
others.
   This year it accelerated the program, sharply raising prices on
a wide range of goods, from matches to toothpaste to pork, China's
favorite meat.
   Prices of decontrolled items such as free-market fruits and
vegetables also snowballed this year, sometimes 20 to 30 percent.
Bananas, for example, cost about 1 yuan (27 cents) a pound in
Beijing, up from about 0.80 yuan last fall.
   Leaders say the increases will stimulate production by
increasing returns to farmers and factories. As China dismantles
its state planning mechanism, they say, prices must fluctuate with
supply and demand in order to cue factories to increase or decrease
output.
   ``If it does not take the step of price reform, China will not
be able to reach developed-nation status by the middle of the next
century,'' leader Deng recently admonished.
   But the reform has created confusion and anger.
   ``We are thankful to Deng Xiaoping for boosting salaries but
remember Mao Tse-tung for not raising prices,'' goes a popular
ditty.
   Food price increases have been the most unpopular. State-store
prices for pork, eggs, vegetables and sugar were raised 30 to 60
percent in May and June in Shanghai, Beijing and other large cities.
   Overall retail prices rose 11 percent nationwide in the first
three months of the year, and the second-quarter figure is likely
to be higher. In large cities the rate of increase has varied from
13 to 19 percent this year.
   More serious are market distortions and profiteering triggered
by raising some prices and not others. Increases in raw material
prices often outstrip those for finished products, forcing
factories to shift production or close.
   Sudden price changes have had an exaggerated impact. Farmers cut
pig production last year because the price was too low, creating a
pork shortage. The government raised the price, and now signs point
to a possible glut.
   Price gouging is widespread. Many private vendors have raised
prices more than approved and pocketed the difference.
   But many official prices are still too low. High-demand items
such as televisions often don't reach the stores because they sell
out on the black market, where prices more accurately reflect
supply and demand. The state sells scarce raw materials cheaply,
but often corrupt factory managers resell them at twice the price.
   ``I earn two yuan (54 cents) a day and have to use this to eat
and buy clothes and raise two children. It's hard,'' said a woman
factory worker shopping for vegetables. Most urban Chinese fare
better _ the average income is 100 yuan ($27) a month.
   Local governments have ordered employers to give their workers
monthly subsidies of 10 yuan ($2.70) to compensate for the food
price increases. But officials acknowledge that inflation could
erode income gains.
   The danger is that previously strong public support for Deng's
shift from a planned economy to an incentive-driven one also will
erode, endangering China's goal of doubling production by the year
2000.
   Nonetheless, top officials appear determined.
   ``We can only go forward, we cannot retreat,'' Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang said recently.
   Foreign experts say that China's price problems seem much less
serious than those of many developing countries.
   ``This country has lived in the ... luxury of not going
anyplace,'' said one Western diplomat. ``But now they want to go
someplace, and one of the things they have to live with is
uncertainty and inflation.''

   While East Germany has a high standard of living
compared with other Soviet Bloc countries, the wait for a new car
runs 11 years and Communist leaders have been acknowledging
shortages of consumer goods.
   A growth spurt in the late 1960s and early 1970s made East
Germany's living standard No. 1 in Eastern Europe. Now, experts
say, Czechoslovakia shares the top honors.
   Lines of 20 to 30 people are common to buy fresh fruit and
vegetables in East Berlin, and such produce often is virtually
impossible to find outside major cities.
   Getting a home telephone can be a major challenge in East
Germany, just as it is in other parts of Eastern Europe. The
Communist Party sets guidelines for telephone installations, which
give preference to people of ``socio-political importance.''
   Average East Germans are quick to point out the tiers of
privileged classes within their nation.
   ``The party leadership has everything they want,'' said a
40-year-old East Berlin house painter, who asked anonymity.
   He worked in the homes of party leaders, he said, and, ``They
shop from the Neckermann catalog (West Germany's leading mail-order
house) and have Philips TV sets. They even have their own hospital
in East Berlin.''
   More than 90 percent of all East German households have a
washing machine and television, but the demand for better quality
products is growing.
   Despite a big housing construction program, getting an apartment
can take years for citizens, forcing many young married couples to
live with relatives.
   But, compared with other Soviet Bloc countries, housing is one
of many areas where East Germans are relatively well off.
   West Berlin's DIW German Institute for Economic Research said in
a new study: ``At 6.6 million, the number of housing units in (East
Germany) is almost as high as the number of households.''
   ``The ratio is less favorable in other countries, particularly
in the Soviet Union, where a large number of families still live in
what is known as communual accommodations in which each family has
a room to itself but has to share kitchen and bathroom,'' DIW adds.
   New housing units average a relatively spacious 96 square yards
in East Germany.
   Slightly more than 40 percent of East German houses and
apartments are in private hands, with half of them occupied by the
owners and the other half rented out at state-controlled low rents,
the institute says. The private owners receive the rent income.
   East German workers lead the East bloc in monthly income, the
institute says. Meat consumtion is the highest in East Germany, 207
pounds a year per capita. The Soviets are last, with 133 pounds,
according to the latest figures available, for 1984.
   Last year's economic growth rate, as measured in national
income, was 3.6 percent, the lowest this decade and far short of
the 4.5 percent goal.
   Heavy state subsidies help keep apartment rent and public
transportation costs low, thus allowing families to spend more
money on household items.
   East Germany has been successful with a comprehensive preventive
medicine program, but there have been signs of discontent within
the socialized medicine system.
   East German sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity said
that anywhere from 2,000 to 3,000 of the nation's 40,000 physicians
are seeking permission to emigrate to West Germany.
   The dissatisfaction, caused in large part by low salaries
provided by the state, even sparked an appeal from East Berlin's
Lutheran Bishop Gottfried Forck. Last spring, appealing to their
``humanitarian responsibility,'' he asked the doctors to stay.
   The West German newsmagazine Der Spiegel recently reported:
``Many doctors are simply fed up with shortages, sloppiness and
corruption in the socialized medicine system, above all in the
provision of medicines.''
   East German Communist Party officials also have been
acknowledging difficulties for consumers, in guarded terms.
   Kurt Hager, a member of the ruling Politburo, told the Communist
Party central committee in Berlin: ``For several types of products,
the need is currently greater than industry can produce.''
   Hager said the shortages included clothing, furniture, radios
and even cosmetic products.
   Like the Soviet Union, East Germany has an alcoholism problem _
``society-wide and of the first rank,'' as Friedhelm Merrchel, an
expert with the Lutheran Church, described it. Six percent of the
adult population are alcoholics, he said, and alcohol plays a part
in 70 percent of divorces.

   BERLIN (AP) _ East Germany, or more correctly the German
Democratic Republic, was formed on Oct. 7, 1949 in the zone
controlled by the Soviets after the Allies victory in World War II.
   Beginning in 1952, the East Germans constructed heavily
fortified borders to halt the flow of millions of refugees to the
West. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, cut off the last major escape
route.
   Here at a glance are some of the other facts about East Germany.
   _Population: 16.6 million.
   _Size: 41,610 square miles, about the size of Virginia.
   _Capital: East Berlin.
   _Per capita income: $8,000 (1984).
   _Sources of income: About 80 percent comes from industry,
including chemicals, plastics, cars, and electronic products,
textile and steel. The largest trading partners are the Soviet
Union, along with neighbors Czechoslovakia and West Germany. The
agricultural sector employs about 980,000 people.
   _Religions: About 80 percent Protestant, 11 percent Roman
Catholic.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Since her one-woman show, ``Without You I'm
Nothing,'' opened off-Broadway in March, Sandra Bernhard has at
last tasted the stardom she dreamed about as an insecure little
girl in Arizona. Critics praise her brilliant monologues of fantasy
and pop cultural commentary. Night-life columnists dog her. That's
just for openers.

   ``I've got to order,'' says Sandra Bernhard,
yanking off her sunglasses. ``I was just at a luncheon where they
served some weird seafood thing.'' She rolls her eyes. ``I'm
allergic to scallops.''
   At the back of the diner, she parks her spindly, 5' 10'' frame
on a bench seat. She juts an uncovered leg across it and orders
iced tea to drown the effects of this steamy Manhattan afternoon.
The waiter brings the tea and extra ice, pronto. He's not dealing
with just another woman in a muscle shirt. This is Sandra the
Fearless. Sandra the Raunchy. Sandra the Only Guest Who Can Make
David Letterman Blush.
   Her star has shot skyward during frequent appearances on ``Late
Nite,'' where she's convincingly feigned pregnancy and fought with
a chimp. Brown eyes flashing and reddish hair radiating out like
brain waves moussed together, she stalks the host, teases him with
nasty innuendoes, then works him over with industrial-strength lips.
   Yet at the eye of Hurricane Sandra there's an insecure,
star-struck little girl from Arizona. This part of her isn't
noticeable right away.
   ``Growing up, I was self-conscious about being skinny, about my
lips, everything,'' she says. So she escaped to Sandraland _ her
fantasy world full of pretty stars and starlets dreamed up during,
and mixed with a typical baby-boom upbringing. It's where her
dreams and sense of humor feed on each other until she regurgitates
them as art.
   Lately her travels through Sandraland have taken her on the
yellow brick road to success. Since her one-woman show, ``Without
You I'm Nothing,'' opened off-Broadway in March, she's been a
fixture in the New York press. Now nobody's billing her as David
Letterman's anything. Critics praise her brilliant monologues of
fantasy and pop cultural commentary. Night-life columnists dog her
through downtown forays.
   Success has, unfortunately, led to severe interview burnout.
   She refuses to talk about her early, struggling days as a
manicurist. (``Oh,'' she pleads. ``It's old news.'') If she's
called a stand-up comic one more time, she'll spit venom. ``You
can't call my show stand-up comedy. It's somewhere between humorous
theater and rock `n' roll.''
   Hot and bothered, Bernhard heads back to Sandraland. A question
about her favorite time period provides the catalyst. ``The
Forties,'' she says, and her eyes flash. ``There was a sense of
glamour and excitement that I feel is lacking now.'' A smile sticks
on her face. She sounds excited. ``It would've been great to be
friends with Vivien Leigh and Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn...''
   Bye, Sandra. Is there a number where we can reach you? ``And
Marilyn. I would've been a really good friend of Marilyn Monroe. We
could've had a lot of laughs. She could've called me any time day
or night and just talked.
   ``I would've been aware of what her neuroses were, how she was
looking for something from men that she never got growing up. And I
would've made her be funny about it, or been funny with her about
it. I wouldn't just say, `Oh, poor Marilyn, you're such a victim.'
I would say, `Kick his butt. Dump him.'''
   Real life, in Bernhard's case, began in Flint, Mich., 33 years
ago. ``My father's a proctologist,'' she says in her show. ``My
mother's an abstract artist. That's how I view the world.'' All
true. She spent her teen years in Scottsdale, Ariz., then after
high school graduation in 1973, followed in her three older
brothers' footsteps to an Israeli kibbutz, where she worked for
eight months.
   ``I was scared to leave home, but I wanted to get out of
there,'' says Bernhard, who never exactly fit into Scottsdale's
suburban mold. ``I had this weird kind of dichotomy of feeling
really competent and at the same time feeling really scared of what
people were thinking of me.''
   She demanded approval and got it by performing. An addiction to
the spotlight took hold early. ``It was my second nature to be
dramatic or funny or entertaining,'' she says. ``In school I was
always sitting outside the door because I'd talk out of turn.
   ``They should encourage kids to talk out of turn. It's the only
time they make any sense.''

   So what better way to make a living than by talking. Upon her
return from Israel, she headed to Los Angeles to kick off her
comedy career. There she served time in a posh Beverly Hills salon
as a manicurist. ``It was weird,'' she says. ``Kind of trashy. Why
not?''
   She spent almost a decade on her feet in comedy clubs, and
gained a following at L.A.'s Comedy Store. In 1983 came the Big
Break: Director Martin Scorsese cast her as a rich neurotic who was
involved in the kidnapping of Jerry Lewis in ``The King of Comedy.''
   ``I don't like comedy clubs,'' says Bernhard. ``Comedy is a very
schlocky kind of outlet for performers.'' ``The King of Comedy''
took her away from all that, and provided her with her first
appearance with Letterman, an old friend from the Comedy Store.
   Eventually she put together ``Without You I'm Nothing.'' Backed
by a band, she sings rock `n' roll, dims the lights and turns her
flashlight on the audience, reads an airplane menu from
first-class, shares some of her favorite fantasies and winds it all
up by shedding a mink coat and singing ``Little Red Corvette'' in a
bra and panties.
   ``We're going to film the show,'' she says, ``and inter-cut it
with all these witnesses, a la `Reds,' where people create this
myth about me and my career.''
   She wants to cast among others, Mary Tyler Moore, Lily Tomlin
and Madonna, who told Bernhard she loved being mentioned in the
show. Bernhard shares a post-nuclear fantasy, where only the
strongest have survived (``Tina Turner is with us, of course'') and
tattered Madonna roams the streets alone. ``People in the know like
it when I talk about them,'' says Bernhard.
   Madonna liked it so much that she and Bernhard have become
friends. These two and co-starlet Jennifer ``Dirty Dancing'' Grey
have become so palsy that Michael Musto, night-life columnist for
The Village Voice, dubbed them ``the witches of Eastvillage,
delightfully so.''
   Such associations bring Sandraland closer and closer to reality
and make Bernhard a bona-fide star. At last.
   ``Fame is immortal,'' says Bernhard. ``When people reach that
level of success, they have a certain immortality that's very
appealing. It's a private club.''
   Don't get her wrong, though. ``I make fun of celebrities when
being famous is the only thing they're about. It's not just about
that with me. I don't really belong in their world, and there's
only a select group of people there that I want to be a part of.
Accompanying the stardom has to be another unique point of view and
intelligence and style. Otherwise, what's the exchange? `I'm
fabulous, you're fabulous?'''
   If Bernhard has only just consummated her relationship with the
seductress called Stardom, then a veritable orgy awaits her. This
August Harper and Row will publish her story collection
``Confessions of a Pretty Lady.'' In the fall she'll appear in
Nicholas Roeg's film ``Track 29'' as a libidinous nurse.
   She also hopes to move her off-Broadway show to Los Angeles,
where she can drive a car and indulge her fascination with
ambulances. In New York, she says, ``They just pass you on the
street.''
   ``When I pass an intersection in Los Angeles and see flashing
lights,'' she writes in ``Confessions,'' ``the first thing I want
to do is slow down to see if anyone was hurt.
   ``Will someone be lying there next to a disfigured, warped
motorcycle, barely clinging to life, bleeding, praying, lost in
another world? I want to see things that I would never want to have
happen to anyone I love.''
   In L.A. she'll continue her live performances while rewriting
her screenplay called ``It came from Poland,'' which she plans to
star in as a cynical writer. ``Writing screenplays is a bit of a
drag,'' she's discovered. ``I'll stick to books, essays, short
stories. They're more enjoyable.''
   One New York writer who said Bernhard is merely obsessed with
fame and fortune is taking a verbal beating in ``Without You I'm
Nothing'' because of it. True, in Sandraland she's always been a
star, ``but a star because the things I say are so unique and so
inherently mine that nobody else could do what I do,'' she
explains. ``And that is what's happening.
   ``The idea of running into Madonna after a nuclear holocaust is
a pretty funny idea. I don't think too many people have had that
fantasy.''

<TEXT>
   Thirty-five years after an armistice
ended the Korean War, tensions on the divided peninsula remain high
and conditions for another war are still there.
   The war of 1950-53 left both nations in devastation and more
than 1 million soldiers and civilians dead or wounded. The United
States committed 5.7 million soldiers, sailors and airmen to the
Korean War under the banner of the United Nations and 33,629 of
them died in battle.
   Today hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops of both
sides face each other along the 150-mile Demilitarized Zone in
virtually the same positions they held the day the armistice was
signed _ July 27, 1953.
   Pro-Western South Korea and Communist North Korea each insists
it is the only legitimate government and both struggle now for
supremacy on the 600-mile peninsula.
   Reuniting Korea is the goal of both governments, but each calls
the other puppets _ the South of the Americans and the North of the
Soviets.
   Technically, the North and the South are still at war; while an
armistice ended the fighting in 1953, no peace treaty has been
signed. The two nations have no ties, the Demilitarized Zone which
divides them at the 38th Parallel is sealed and they have no links
except for a single hotline.
   The two sides have been engaged in frequent clashes since 1953
but so far they have avoided another war. Few signs point to an
end, however, to one of the world's most dangerous power struggles.
   President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea called on July 7 for an end
to confrontation and the opening of peaceful ties. He proposed
trade, political and cultural links to lead to eventual
reunification.
   ``We should be able to find a breakthrough toward a lasting
peace and unification on the Korean peninsula, which is still
fraught with the danger of war,'' Roh said.
   North Korea ridiculed Roh's plan and said it was not worth
considering. The North also refused to even accept a letter from
the South on July 15 calling for student exchange visits.
   Roh's proposals were similar to other iniatives by the South and
there was little sign the new ones would lead to a breakthrough.
Three rounds of talks between the two nations since 1971 on
reducing tensions and building ties collapsed.
   Both want to reunite the peninsula, but neither is willing to
abandon its political system or renounce its claims to be the sole
government of Korea.
   South Korea achieved a major political and diplomatic victory
over the North by becoming the site for the 1988 Olympic Games,
starting in September. The South makes little secret of the fact
that it sees the games as international recognition of its claim to
be the true Korean government.
   ``The Olympics will mark a critical turning point for Seoul to
achieve permanent superiority over Pyongyang,'' the official Korean
Development Institute of Seoul said in a report. Pyongyang is North
Korea's capital.
   North Korea, furious over Seoul's Olympics accomplishment, plans
to boycott the games unless it can be the co-host. Olympic
authorities have refused and the North's hopes of a major boycott
by its Communist allies collapsed when the Soviet Union and China
entered the Games.
   The Korean peninsula was divided by Soviet and U.S. forces that
ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. Efforts
to reunite failed and rival governments were formed in 1948. The
North invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War.
   In addition to the United States, 15 other nations sent troops
to help South Korea during the war and today 42,000 U.S. troops
remain in the country.
   Memories of the war haunt both nations and fuel mutual mistrust.
   ``The Korean War made unification an impossible task,'' said
Choi Jank-sok, a South Korean political analyst. ``Tensions between
the two Koreas have never been reduced,''
   South Korean cities hold monthly air raid drills, men serve in
militias or civil defense units until they are 50 years old and
army units on maneuvers are a common sight. Seoul is dotted with
gun emplacements disguised as flower beds and fortifications ring
the city, which is within artillery range of North Korea.
   North Korea has repeatedly attacked the South, including a 1983
bombing against former President Chun Doo-hwan and his Cabinet that
killed 16 people.
   The North was implicated in the bombing Nov. 29 of a South
Korean airliner with the loss of all 115 people aboard as part of
attempts to disrupt the Olympics.
   North Korea is one of the most regimented police states in the
world with the government controlling almost every aspect of life.
The country is virtually closed to foreigners.
   Its supreme leader, 75-year-old Kim Il Sung, has built up a huge
personality cult that portrays him as a sort of Marxist god. People
are drilled from childhood to revere him as the ``Great Leader.''
   Kim, who has been in power since 1945, started the Korean War
and observers say unification is impossible while he rules the
North.
   ``Nothing has changed in the North, and as a matter of fact the
situation in the North is getting worse,'' said Professor Rhee
Chong-ik of South Korea's Chongju University.
   North Korea, with a population of just 20 million, has the sixth
largest army in the world with 800,000 troops and as many as 5
million in reserve. It has a 3-to-1 lead in jets aircraft, tanks
and other weapons, but much of its weaponry is old and one third of
its planes are of Korean War vintage, according to Western
estimates.
   North Korea, hobbled by bureaucracy, also has seen its economy
fall into chaos. Huge resources are swallowed up by the army, life
in the North is spartan and there are reports of food shortages.
   The balance of power has changed in recent years as the South's
soaring economy has turned it into a growing Asian power. The
South, with a population of 41 million, has outstripped the North
at almost every level.
   Seoul's increasingly powerful military, with 650,000 men and 3
million reserves, has a technological lead that outweighs the
North's numerical superiority, analysts say. South Korean leaders
say they will be able to do without U.S. military aid by the late
1990s.
   The Roh government, which took office in February, has pledged
to end decades of authoritarian rule in the South and a major
political liberalization has been the result. The government says
it is building a democratic system that will end South Korea's
internal divisions.
   Some political leaders, intellectuals and others say the reforms
must include a major effort to end the confrontation with the North.
   ``As the United States deals with the Soviet Union we can deal
with North Korea _ with a careful and sincere attitude,'' said
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung.
   Reunification has been freely debated in the South as the
government lifted controls that had made the subject taboo. South
Koreans want reunification, but not if it means Communist rule.
   Peace advocates hope better relations between the superpowers
can ease the confrontation.
   ``It would be exceedingly difficult for North Korea to resist
the trend of the times and insist on keeping its doors hermetically
sealed,'' said analyst Kim Young-won.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ If delegates to the Republican National
Convention want to blow off some non-political steam, they'll be in
the right place: steamy New Orleans, as practiced as any city in
the land in diverting visitors from serious business at hand.
Here's a lively preview of what they'll find.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elephants, they say, never forget, so it is
presumed enough Republicans will remember to show up on the right
night for the George Bush nominating rites.
   But as another saying goes way down yonder in New Orleans, ``One
never knows, do one?''
   Conventions in the Big Easy are notorious for record
registrations and abysmal attendance, the question being how do you
keep 'em corralled for a quorum after they've seen Bourbon Street?
   Delegate roundups were something of a problem at the 1964
Republican Convention in San Francisco, another city notable for
its varied lures.
   Now, in ``The City that Care Forgot,'' as New Orleans fancies
itself, life-sized cutout posters and bawling barkers in the French
Quarter tout an erotic array of strippers, ``French orgies,'' women
wrestlers a la mat, mud or Jell-O, plus Dixieland jazz blaring from
the doorways as background music for the break dancers drawing
crowds and coins in the street and, remaining open long after the
night's final gavel for the delectation of the delegates, some of
the sleaziest bars and best restaurants in the world.
   Care didn't entirely forget the city in the wake of the
Louisiana oil bust. The hard times that fell upon the city gave its
leaders a triple incentive to land a convention that means a
sizable infusion of dollars into the local economy.
   In view of New Orleans' diverse attractions, maybe it's just as
well that the 90,000 seats in the Superdome are color coordinated
in a unique camouflage that makes this enormous venue of three
Super Bowls, the Sugar Bowl, basketball's Final Four, a papal
audience, the Saints and Tulane football and every kind of circus
and rodeo always seem filled.
   Actually the Republicans will occupy less than half of the arena
when the curtain rises _ or drops, actually _ Aug. l5 on the start
of their four-day, national party convention.
   It costs $30,000 each time to hang the $1 million, 9-story high,
3-ton blue curtain across the length of the football field to
divide the Superdome into a convention-sized hall seating about
31,000.
   This figure does not include the TV and radio broadcasters
looking down from the four super sky boxes and 46 private suites
perched beneath the 10-acre foam rubber roof, nor the l,000 print
journalists with telephones and laptop word processors up on the
70-foot-long, 30-foot high podium.
   Monday's opening session is President's Night, when Ronald
Reagan makes his emotional hail and farewell appeal for unity
behind the new standard bearer, then is seen no more at the
convention.
   ``It's hard to outshine a president, so, like Ike in 1960, he
feels he should not hang around,'' says convention manager Bill
Phillips, relaying the word from the White House.
   Phillips, managing his first national convention and also the
first ever held in New Orleans, sums up his job as ``anticipating
What Ifs?''
   What if a hurricane happens? The convention meets at the height
of the hurricane season on the Gulf Coast. What if a major fire
breaks out in the hotel district, like the six-alarmer that
devastated the historic Cabildo next door to the St. Louis
Cathedral a few weeks ago?
   What if sudden summer storms off Lake Pontchartrain flood the
streets? Will the 2,277 delegates and as many alternates wade
through?
   What if the heat and humidity outdo what is suffocatingly normal
for New Orleans in August?
   Even though most of the allocated 20,000 hotel rooms are within
walking distance of the Superdome, the organizers have lined up
8,000 rental cars and 200 air-conditioned buses to hurry
conventioneers out of the heat.
   In addition to insuring that the sessions get under way in time
for the 6 o'clock evening news and close with time for analysis on
the 11 o'clock news, and that the band doesn't play ``My Old
Kentucky Home'' when the delegate from Tennessee approaches the
microphone, and seeing that Vice President Bush and whoever aspires
to succeed him are properly showcased for TV by $1 million worth of
new lighting effects, Phillips and his staff have a few other items
on their work sheets.
   Such as finding 10,000 volunteers to act as guides, ushers,
interpreters, messengers, envelope stuffers, and another healthy
100 to blow up 100,000 balloons.
   Organizers also have been advised by Zeke Segal, who served as
CBS bureau chief at a dozen of these quadrennial conclaves, to lay
their hands ``on as many toilet chains as can be found'' in support
of press credentials.
   ``Press credentials are the number-one souvenir,'' Segal told an
all-day seminar devoted to convention planning. ``People walk up
and rip 'em off your neck. It doesn't matter if you're Dan Rather
or the kid who runs the coffee. We found the only solution was to
hang them on real toilet chains like you find in a hardware store.''
   As for Don Fowler, his counterpart at the Democratic convention
in Atlanta, Phillips' worst ``what if'' nightmare conjures up the
Democratic Convention of 1968 in Chicago. Unlikely as any reprise
seems in the '80s, ``All our planning comes down to avoiding that
scene,'' Phillips says.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: Phillips says.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The ultramodern Superdome, which glows in the night at the edge
of the historic district like a giant set of dentures disgorged in
a Mardi Gras debauch, loomed large in attracting the convention.
The site selection committee was equally impressed by the city's
proven cool in handling huge crowds with what Peggy Wilson, the
only Republican on the city council, calls ``good-natured aplomb.''
   ``This is not a demonstrating city; people here tend to be
laid-back,'' says assistant police superintendent Ray Holman, who
specializes in planning for special events like Mardi Gras, the
1984 World's Fair, the pope's visit last September and the 1981
Rolling Stones concert that drew 87,500 to the Superdome.
   ``Demonstrators won't be penned up on the other side of Canal
Street or out on the Lakefront. They'll have access to the
delegates,'' Holman says, divulging a game plan honed by his two
decades of experience at crowd control. ``Frustrated demonstrators
can become a mob. We'll treat them with dignity and respect.''
   Horse and foot patrols will prowl ``every alley and corridor''
of the crime-pocked French Quarter until 4 a.m., ``and if there's
any delegates still wandering around after that, we'll see that
they get back to their hotels.''
   While Atlanta put its most modern foot forward rather than its
antebellum past for the Democrats, overwhelmingly Democratic New
Orleans flaunted to the site selection committee the rich and rowdy
history that has made tourism the city's number-one industry.
   For delegates at downtime, jam sessions of aging Dixieland
musicians will evoke the storied past of Storyville, and the lacy
wrought-iron balconies of the Vieux Carre, the old quarter, seem to
whisper still the sensuous secrets of the Creole culture that adds
spice to the night life and the cuisine.
   The tourist promenade along the downtown bend of the
Mississippi, past the old banana wharfs and molasses sheds,
reverberates with the howling hiss of steam calliopes and the
deep-throated bellow of steamboat whistles from paddle-wheelers
taking on sightseers behind the old Jackson Brewery, which is
enjoying a new life as a boutique mall. The St. Charles trolley,
the nation's longest-running streetcar line, sways along the
crescent of the river out to the Greek revival mansions of the
Garden District. Black funeral bands such as the Olympia Brass
Band, stomping out the legacy of Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory and
Jellyroll Morton with swaying parasols and wailing clarinets, greet
the pope, presidents and foreign dignitaries at the airport.
   In New Orleans, nostalgia is a necessary nostrum, its past is a
placebo for the painful present. Since the Louisiana oil bust,
times have been hard in the Big Easy. The city has yet to recover
from the 1986 ``summer of short cash,'' when 1,200 city employees
lost their jobs and the rest went on a four-day week. Faced with a
$30 million budget deficit, City Hall shut its doors every Friday.
   New Orleans sparkles from its $30 million World's Fair face
lift, but beyond the flowers blooming in the charming courtyards,
and along the neutral ground of streets arched with live oaks, lurk
chronic unemployment and economic decay. In a city of 600,000
people, more than 10,000 houses are for sale.
   New hotels tower above Canal Street, but more department stores
and luxury shops are being boarded up, so at times tourists seem to
encounter only other tourists along what is billed as the nation's
broadest boulevard.
   River traffic is way down, reflecting farm foreclosures in the
grain belt as well as the collapse of upstream petrochemical
plants. There has been a promising upturn in port tonnage, due to
improved foreign trade, but the state legislature, also in a deep
budget bind, is threatening further cuts in municipal aid.
   New Orleans desperately wanted the GOP convention, with its
estimated $138 million boost to the economy. Civic leaders wooed
the nine-member site selection committee like the ravishing
plantation belle in a Frances Parkinson Keyes romance.
   Cajun chef Paul Prudhomme whipped up a 17-course banquet for the
search committee at the home of lawyer Darryl Berger. Local
boosters somehow laid their hands on 18 tickets to a Saints-Redskin
game, so site selectors could attend with their spouses.
   When the committee moved on to the other nine cities under final
consideration, they were pursued by 700 love letters from the
business community and a barrage of ``lagniappe,'' little reminder
gifts, like samples of Louisiana hot sauce, pralines, gumbo, and
Mardi Gras king cakes.
   Oilman Patrick Taylor, who spearheaded the painful and still
unfinished job of prying $5 million from the merchants to offset
the city's expenses in hosting the convention, stressed ``the long
term'' benefits to the local economy.
   ``We got a chance to turn this city around and give it a
boost,'' he tells everyone he meets, hat in hand. ``There'll be
more corporate leaders and foreign bigwigs in town than at any
other time in our history. Detroit got new factories and is still
riding the wave of the 1980 GOP convention. If all goes well,
there's every hope we'll get the Democrats in '92.''
   Peggy Wilson, among other convention go-getters, welcomes the
exposure New Orleans will receive from ``having the `Today Show,'
`Good Morning America,' Ted Koppel and all the network anchors
orginate from here.''
   That's not to mention the money thousands of media types will
spend on rentals, services, drivers, clerical help and post-session
relaxation.
   But for those who dream the opening gavel will signify instant
economic recovery, CBS veteran Segal had a jolting wake-up call.
   ``The days of the big expense accounts are over,'' he
regretfully informed the seminar. ``Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw may
be dining at Antoine's. The rest will be sending out for pizzas.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ No one's isolated it, but humanity seems to be
supplied with a gene that engenders a craving to be the first to do
something _ anything, no matter how peripheral. Fame sometimes
results, usually as long-lived as the fruit fly, but from
Neanderthal days forward, there's no stopping the firsters.

   Everybody knows that Jackie Robinson was the
first black Big League baseball player, most everyone knows Sandra
Day O'Connor was the first woman to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court,
but what does the name Steve Newman do for you?
   Well, he was the first man to walk all alone around the world.
   And there are many other individuals who did something first,
people who had their Warholian 15 minutes of fame, sometimes of a
dubious nature, sometimes revolutionary, sometimes profoundly
forgettable.
   Newman, of Bethel, Ohio, took four years for his global stroll
and he got more than 15 minutes of fame out of it.
   ``Andy Warhol was wrong,'' says Newman, who completed his trek
in 1987. ``If I wanted to be boring, I could live on this for the
rest of my life. It is not a 15-minute thing.'' He says he got a
$100,000 advance for a book.
   He also gets requests for three or four speeches a week at
$1,000 a throw, which he says is ``like being paid for being Marco
Polo.''
   Less of a saga is the achievement of Fred Muermann of Chetek,
Wis., who very quietly grew a cornstalk 22 feet and 3 inches high,
said by the Guinness Book of World Records to be the tallest ever.
   And a wee one named Gordon, entirely oblivious to the honor, was
the first baby to be born on television, according to ``Famous
First Facts,'' a reference work containing many such nuggets.
Gordon arrived by Caesarean section at Colorado General Hospital in
Denver on Dec. 2, 1952, greeted by KFEL-TV. The program aired on 49
NBC affiliates as the high point of an American Medical Association
clinical meeting.
   The first marriage of two U.S. representatives took place on
Jan. 2, 1976, in Topeka, Kan. Andrew Jacobs Jr., of Indiana,
married Martha Keyes of Kansas. They are now divorced and neither
is still in Congress.
   The first nun to become a mayor of an American city was Sister
Carolyn Farrell, a Sister of Charity, BVM. She was elected to the
City Council in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1977, and became mayor in 1980.
   She didn't mind the to-do, but the Roman Catholic Church minded
clerics seeking public office and she didn't run for re-election.
   Carolyn, as most people call her, says the name recognition she
achieved helped her pursue her goals for social change.
   ``Basically, I'm still an activist and a feminist,'' says the
52-year-old nun who has been in the convent for 33 years.
   This September she is going to the Hubert Humphrey Institute of
Public Policy at the University of Minnesota for seminars on
reflective leadership, leadership in spirituality and ethics and
women in leadership.
   High-tech, biogenetic and space firsts cluster thickly in the
past two or three decades, but lower-tech triumphs haven't lost
their allure.
   The pilots of the Voyager, Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan, made
history in 1986 when they flew around the world in the first
non-stop flight without refueling, Dec. 14-23. The rigors of the
preparation unfueled a romance between the pilots. They parted as
friends.
   Kanellos Kannellopoulos very nearly re-created the myth of
Daedalus when the real-life Greek, a cycling champ, flew farther
than anyone else in a human powered plane last April 23. By
pedaling the 72-pound aircraft on a 74-mile flight from Crete to
Santorini and crashing into the sea just 10 yards offshore,
Kanelloppoulos broke earlier records of 37.2 miles and 22.5 miles.
   Newman's ultra low-tech feat, doggedly putting one foot in front
of the other, drew some appropriately primitive adventures.
   He was attacked in Morocco, he says, by a man with a scar
running down the side of his face and one eyeball missing.
   ``I hadn't seen the movie, but I did a Crocodile Dundee. I
pulled out a bigger knife and he ran,'' says Newman. Bandits also
set upon him with machetes in Thailand, he says, and he fended them
off with an umbrella. In Africa, 13 wild boars treed him for a
night.

   Now engaged to be married to the girl almost next door, the
6-foot-2 Newman says he intends to keep using his feet as a means
of meeting ordinary people and writing about them.
   ``Eventually I wanted to become a novelist, but I want to do
more walking stories,'' he says. The trek, incidentally, boiled
down to 19 cents a mile, compared, he notes, to a spacecraft's
costs of $3,000 a mile.
   ``People took care of me, so the whole trip cost only about
$4,000,'' he says.
   Eva Shain may agree that Andy Warhol's sense of time was wrong.
Back in 1977, she became the first woman to judge a world
heavyweight championship fight, Muhammed Ali vs. Ernie Shavers.
She's still in the business. Although her expertise was not needed,
she was a judge at the 91-second world heavyweight fight between
Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks.
   She says she still gets calls about her headline-making 1977
appointment. It was a surprise to her. ``I thought I was doing the
undercard. It wasn't until I got there that I found out I was doing
the championship fight.''
   A feature on her then appeared in The New York Times and she
received two proposals by mail, although she has been married for
years to ring announcer Frank Shain, who appeared in the movie
``Raging Bull'' as the ring announcer.
   Mrs. Shain appeared on ``What's My Line'' and ``To Tell the
Truth'' as well as other television shows at the time.
   Firsts seem to beget firsts. She was also the first woman
inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame, the first woman
to judge a fight on an aircraft carrier, the USS Lexington in
Pensacola, Fla., the first woman to work professional fights in New
Jersey, her home state, and in Texas.
   The Thomas Powners and their three children in 1959 endured two
weeks in a fallout shelter for the nuclear family, reporetedly
aided by ``a copy of `Lady Chatterley's Lover,' tranquilizers and
whiskey.''
   Thomas Powner, who worked at Princeton University at the time
and is still a schoolteacher, says several scientists asked him if
he would consider the stunt for the family.
   Powner recalls that his wife, now deceased, had second thoughts,
but they went ahead. They were paid, he remembers, about $600.
   ``Actually, there was only one bottle of whiskey. We only had a
few drinks, but there were lots of books and we read a lot,'' he
says.
   Like Mrs. Shain, the family's picture was on the front pages
when they came out. They went on to appear on television shows of
the time, ``Who Do You Trust?'' ``The Dave Garroway Show,'' ``The
Henry Morgan Show.''
   They also made some commercials afterward and his wife traveled
extensively on behalf of the Civil Defense campaign, a campaign now
all but forgotten.
   Powner, 58 and remarried, says his students always know about
his sheltered past and he retells the story for each new class.
   In the sporting world, firsts are numerous, obscure and
remembered more by the statisticians than by the record holders.
Take Larry Doby, the second black player in the majors, the second
black manager and now, at 64, community relations director for the
New Jersey Nets of the NBA.
   Asked who was the first black player to hit a home run in a
World Series, Doby said: ``I don't know. Jackie, I guess.''
   Informed that it was none other than himself, he laughed.
   ``Me?'' he said. ``I guess because I've been the second so
often, I'm always surprised to hear that I was the first at
anything.''
   He did remember, however, the blow and that he hit it off the
Boston Braves' Johnny Sain in the third inning of the fourth game.
   And who was the first professional baseball player?
   Alfred James Reach, an outfielder for the Philadelphia Athletics
of the National Association. From 1871 to 1875, he played in 82
games, but he's in the record books because in 1874 he received the
princely sum of $1,000 for playing in 14 games.
   There is no explanation why the other players seemed to play
gratis.

   Things as well as people fall into famous firsts categories.
   Did you know, or care, that Kreuger beer, brewed in Newtown,
N.J., was the first beer sold in cans? That was in 1935.
   Or that the first automatic toll collector went into service
Nov. 19, l954, on New Jersey's Garden State Parkway.
   Or that the first indoor ski slope opened in Buffalo, N.Y. on
Jan. 17, 1962?
   The bikini was first displayed at a Paris salon by French
designer Louis Reaud on July 5, 1946, an event that perhaps
contributed to the entire anti-cellulite industry, workout tapes,
and ogling as a higher art form.
   The first drive-in theater? That opened June 6, 1933, on Wilson
Boulevard in Camden, N.J. Conclusions about its contributions to
the culture are too numerous to be listed, but it undoubtedly
created a plethora of personal firsts not to be recorded in
reference books.
   Parkinson's Law _ ``Work expands to fill the time for its
completion'' _was invented in 1958 by Cyril Parkinson, a historian.
   Hula hoops were swiped from the Australians and brought to the
United States in 1959. They're still around.
   In May 1987, the first health club for dogs opened in Paris, in
January 1986, the entire Bible was translated into Navajo for the
first time, and the first hotel to have a Gideon Bible slipped into
the bedside table was the Superior Hotel in Iron Mountain, Mont.,
on Nov. 10, 1908, all among matters duly recorded in a book,
``Famous First Facts.''
   If you're overextended on your plastic, you can thank Frank
McNamara and Ralph Schneider, both of whom are now deceased. In
1950, they started Diner's Club, the first credit card. The first
cards were given to 200 subscribers who could use them at 27
restaurants in the New York City area. The fee was $5 and their
growth makes Topsy look like a bonsai tree. By the next year,
hotels and nightclubs were added. In 1952, the idea moved to the
West Coast, in 1953 it went international and by the mid-1950s
everybody was in the act.
   Lots of firsts ended up in the first graveyard.
   Sample: Chemical Bank of New York City struck a dubious first on
Dec. 22, 1972, when it decided to show motion pictures to its
customers waiting in line. Not too many of those around today.
   And in 1955 Robert McGill came up with a one-man, rocket-powered
helicopter that could be strapped to the flyer's back and guided by
a throttle. Enthusiasts thought it would revolutionize warfare, not
to mention commuting, but it proved to be another first without
progeny.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Ever since its founding in 1949, East Germany's
Communist leadership has marched to the tune piped in the Kremlin.
When the melody changed with Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms, the aging
chieftains developed a political defense, despite increasing
pressures at home. But their era may be ending.

   Facing mounting dissent at home and pressure for
reforms similar to the Soviet Union's, the aging leadership of East
Germany is clinging to power as the nation nears its 40th birthday.
   Economic troubles have been aggravating chronic shortages of
consumer goods, while young people are demanding the freedoms they
see on West German television broadcast over the border.
   ``Down with the Berlin Wall! Down with the Berlin Wall!'' young
East Germans shouted in one recent protest. East German police
quickly moved in and broke up the demonstration of more than 5,000
people.
   Communist leader Erich Honecker, the man who built that wall in
1961 at the direction of Communist Party chief Walter Ulbricht,
turns 76 in August. He and his septuagenarian deputies are holding
onto the power some of them gained shortly after the country was
formed in the Soviet image in 1949.
   In the Soviet Union, the Stalinist repression of those days has
given way to Mikhail Gorbachev's crusade for perestroika and
glasnost (restructuring and openness) and young East Germans lately
have taken to gathering near the wall with cries of, ``Gorby,
Gorby!''
   But East Germany's leadership has emphasized that it does not
intend to change course.
   ``Honecker is a fossil and still shows the characteristics of
his era,'' says Guenther Buch of the All-German Institute, the Bonn
government's research branch that keeps tabs on East German
developments. ``The old officials are clinging to their jobs.''
   The aging leaders in the nation of 16.6 million people include:
   _Honecker, a member of the ruling Politburo since 1958 and head
of the Communist Party since 1971.
   _Premier Willi Stoph, 73, a Politburo member since 1953.
   _Erich Mielke, the 80-year-old head of the state police, has
been a central committee member for 38 years.
   _Deputy Premier Alfred Neumann is 78 and a Politburo member
since 1958.
   In all, 46 of the 160 members of the party's central committee
have been there more than 20 years. The party is officially known
as the Socialist Unity Party (SED).
   ``The SED isn't thinking of change, but they are under
pressure,'' says Buch. ``Certainly, the Honecker era is heading
toward an end.''
   Buch looks for a gradual hand-over of power shortly before the
next Communist Party Congress, expected in 1991. The succession
remains a matter of much speculation. One name frequently mentioned
is that of Egon Krenz, the 51-year-old Politburo member who since
1983 has been in charge of youth, sports and security.
   Honecker himself has pledged to stick to the course East Germany
has followed for nearly two decades. Perestroika, he said last
June, originated in the Soviet Union's internal needs. ``They
wanted to break open a certain incrustation of the economic life.''
   East Germany, he said, intends to follow ``the proven way.''
   Party leaders note that the country already has made some
significant changes in the economic structure.
   In the mid-1960s, the East Germans introduced a new economic
system that eased some central planning controls and allowed
factories to make profits if they were reinvested in operations or
redistributed to workers as bonuses. After several years of growth
that put it at the head of the Soviet Bloc, however, the economy
showed signs of slowing in the late 1970s.
   The German Institute for Economics Research says last year's
economic growth rate of 3.6 percent, measured in terms of national
income, fell significantly short of the target of 4.5 percent set
by economic planners. It was East Germany's second lowest this
decade.
   A harsh winter last year and a drought this spring are hurting
agriculture, which employs about 980,000 people.
   ``Shortage was the dominating feature in the economic area,''
said the West Berlin-based institute. Especially hard-hit are
consumer goods outside major cities.
   Public dissent threatened to boil over earlier this year, when
scores of East Germans were arrested in crackdowns.
   Young people grouped under the protection of the Lutheran Church
have been clamoring for more freedom, especially the chance to
travel abroad. The May Day parade on May 1 brought out an
unprecedented number of security agents to prevent disturbances.
   Travel restrictions were eased temporarily.
   After the June disturbances near the Berlin Wall, East German
security agents roughed up two West German television crews.
   That prompted the West Berlin Morgenpost newspaper to suggest
that the actions were a government-organized attack and not an
on-the-spot decision. The paper wondered ``whether Erich Honecker
hasn't been overridden by comrades who see his course as being too
soft.''
   While the speculation continues, the Lutheran Church in East
Germany keeps up its pressure. More than 80 percent of the
population is Lutheran and the church remains a vital force in this
Communist nation.
   ``We have to start recognizing what is not right, and then we
have to go about starting to live in a new way,'' the Rev. Joachim
Gauck, a Lutheran leader in the northern region of Mecklenburg,
told a church convention last June.
   ``We'll want to stay here, once we're also allowed to leave,''
he said, referring to the thousands of East Germans who have been
denied permission to leave the country.
   Gauck also asked for ``more openness'' in East Germany, an
indirect reference to Gorbachev's political reforms in the Soviet
Union.
   He said that East German Christians are encouraged by Soviet
signs ``that a mistake can be called a mistake.''

<HEAD>People With Potentially Deadly Allergies Need Epinephrine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college coed allergic to peanuts dropped
dead after eating chili at a restauarant, unaware it contained the
nuts.
   A 57-year-old man died after he was stung repeatedly while
trying to trap a swarm of bees. He was so allergic that one or two
stings would have killed him.
   A chronic alcoholic knew he was allergic to shellfish, but ate
crab salad in a late-night refrigerator raid. He passed out and
died before help arrived.
   The deaths were due to anaphylaxis, the most severe allergic
reaction.
   But underlying that, none of the victims carried the stimulant
epinephrine, which counteracts anaphylaxis if injected immediately
when symptoms start.
   New studies indicate that many people prone to anaphylaxis don't
carry epinephrine injection kits at all times, even though it can
save their lives and kits are easily available by prescription for
$5 to $30.
   ``If you had an episode of anaphylaxis, you're likely to have
another,'' said Dr. Bruce Wolf, a Nashville, Tenn., allergist.
``Because this reaction can be fatal, you need to have
epinephrine.''
   Anaphylaxis can kill by causing shock _ a heart- and
breath-stopping sudden loss of blood pressure _ or by swelling
victims' throats so they suffocate.
   Epinephrine maintains blood pressure and decreases swelling. It
also fights less deadly symptoms, including hives, flushing,
itching, headache, runny nose, asthma and shortness of breath,
sneezing, anxiety, uterine or stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal bloating and fainting.
   Dr. Deborah Birx, an allergist at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center in Washington, D.C., suffered anaphylaxis aboard an airplane
after eating kiwi fruit while flying to an allergists' convention
in California.
   ``First my heart started racing, then I felt lightheaded. That's
when I started feeling terrified. Then I had difficulty swallowing,
and felt that if I swallowed, I wouldn't be able to breathe again.''
   Flight attendants had epinephrine on board but it didn't fully
stop her allergic reaction, so the plane made an emergency landing
in Omaha, Neb., where Birx's reaction finally abated at a hospital.
   Each year, anaphylaxis kills up to 50 Americans stung by bees,
yellowjackets, wasps, hornets or fire ants; about 1,000 allergic to
penicillin; and another 1,000 allergic to dyes injected during
certain X-ray procedures, said Dr. Michael A. Kaliner, chief of the
allergic diseases section at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.
   In addition, Dr. John Yunginger of the Mayo Clinic estimated,
anaphylaxis annually kills five to eight Americans allergic to
nuts, shellfish, eggs, seeds and other foods, although less than a
dozen deaths have been documented.
   Other causes are food additives like sulfites; allergy shots;
snake venom; animal bites; extreme doses of pollen; blood products,
and drugs. Among those are antibiotics and heart medications,
vaccines, vitamins, hydrocortisone, anesthetics, and aspirin,
acetaminophen, codeine and other painkillers.
   Nearly 200,000 hospitalized patients a year suffer
medicine-induced anaphylaxis and 50,000 more are hospitalized
because of reactions, according to the American Academy of Allergy
and Immunology. Kaliner believes that is high.
   He said the most common cause is exercise, though no deaths are
known.
   Kaliner estimated that one in 2,500 to one in 10,000
anaphylactic episodes are fatal. Dr. Tim Sullivan, head of allergy
and immunology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center, contended that those figures include mild allergic
reactions he doesn't consider anaphylaxis. Sullivan said up to 10
percent of people hospitalized with severe anaphylaxis die.
   The anaphylaxis deaths of the coed and the alcoholic were among
eight food-induced deaths studied by Yunginger and his colleagues.
   ``In no case was epinephrine administered before or immediately
after onset of symptoms,'' they reported to the American Academy of
Allergy and Immunology. The bee-sting victim also didn't carry
epinephrine, authorities said.
   Wolf and Dr. Phil Lieberman, another Tennessee allergist,
surveyed 89 allergic patients who had suffered anaphylaxis and
found that among those who responded, ``only 50 percent kept
epinephrine with them despite being warned to do so... Patients
either forget or ignore these admonitions.''
   Patricia Hutcheson and colleagues at St. Louis University
Medical Center surveyed 76 patients with insect-sting anaphylaxis
who were treated with epinephrine in hospital emergency rooms.
   ``We found that 82 percent had not received any advice on the
avoidance of insects, 71 percent had not received a prescription
for an epinephrine kit and 44 percent did not receive advice to
consult an allergist,'' she wrote. ``More effort must be made
toward educating emergency room personnel about preventive
measures.''
   Kaliner said epinephrine kits should be carried by anyone who
has had an anaphylactic episode, but not by everyone with
allergies. They also should be carried by those prone to severe
asthma attacks and those allergic to sulfites, peanuts and
shellfish, said Dr. Ronald Simon, an allergist at the University of
California, San Diego's Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation.
   Kaliner said people who might need epinephrine should carry one
kit and keep one each in the home, car and office. Those whose
throats swell during anaphylaxis should carry an epinephrine
inhaler to avoid suffocating.
   The simplest to use of the kits is the EpiPen, a pre-loaded,
push-button syringe that looks like a fountain pen and costs $20 to
$30. The Anakit, $17 to $22, is a pre-loaded conventional syringe.
Finally, you can buy glass ampules of epinephrine for about $5, and
load your own 20- to 50-cent syringe.
   Epinephrine speeds the heart, and can cause heart attack or
failure, or deadly abnormal heart rhythms in people with heart
disease. Kaliner said these people should inject half the normal
dose if they suffer anaphylaxis.
   His advice to people prone to anaphylaxis is simple: ``If
symptoms begin, take both an antihistamine (preferably in quickly
absorbed liquid form) and epinephrine. Then get yourself to a
hospital.''

   Here are the recommendations of allergy
experts and the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology to
prevent anaphylaxis:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>GENERAL ADVICE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Learn about your allergies. Consult a board-certified allergist
and undergo appropriate tests, then avoid whatever causes the
allergies. Exercise, insect stings, medicines, foods and dyes
injected for certain X-ray procedures are the most common causes of
severe allergic reactions.
   _Avoid unproven allergy tests and treatments, including
cytotoxic testing, urine injections and ``sublingual provocation
and neutralization,'' said Dr. Michael Kaliner of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   _Carry an epinephrine injection kit at all times. Make sure you
and people close to you know how to use it.
   _Wear a medical emergency identification listing your known
allergies.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FOOD ALLERGIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Aavoid foods to which you are allergic. Carefully read
ingredient labels on foods.
   _In restaurants, ask the server about meal ingredients. Be
assertive: One man died of anaphylaxis after being assured his meal
didn't contain peanuts; It did.
   _Learn which foods are related to those to which you are
allergic. If you are allergic to shrimp, you also may be allergic
to other shellfish or fish.
   _When invited to dine at someone's home, tell the host or
hostess about your food allergies ahead of time.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>DRUG ALLERGIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Learn the names of all medications to which you are allergic,
as well as medications related to them.
   _Inform all doctors who treat you about your allergies to
medications.
   _When in doubt, ask your doctor about the safety of any
medication.
   _Keep a written record of the names and appropriate doses of all
medications you take.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>INSECT STING ALLERGIES</BYLINE>

   _Be careful while gardening.
   _Don't wear anything that would suggest a flower. Avoid
hairspray, perfume and lotions. Avoid wearing black or brightly
colored clothing.
   _Avoid wearing loose clothing. Insects can get trapped in it.
   _Always wear shoes when you go outdoors.
   _Ask an allergist about allergy shots, called venom
desensitization, for allergies to insect stings.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>ALLERGY TO EXERCISE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Exercise with a friend who knows how to administer epinephrine.
   _Don't exercise for at least four and preferably six hours after
eating. Exercise allergy often is associated with food allergies.
   _Avoid aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
before exercise. The painkillers have been associated with
exercise-induced anaphylaxis in some patients.
   _If you develop hives, itching or other symtpoms while
exercising, stop.

<HEAD>Pain, Fever, Heart Attacks And Now Senility Helped By Aspirin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aspirin, the medicine-cabinet marvel that eases
pain, lowers fevers and prevents heart attacks, may also conquer a
form of senility.
   New research that is still unpublished and must be confirmed by
larger studies suggests that aspirin can stop _ and even reverse _
the ravages of tiny blood clots inside the head.
   Dr. John S. Meyer of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston says
he's seen apparent improvement over time when aspirin is given to
elderly people who have suffered multiple small strokes.
   These people have what's called multi-infarct dementia. Repeated
disruptions in blood flow kill parts of their brains, and they
become confused and lose their memory and other intellectual
faculties.
   By far the biggest cause of dementia in the elderly is
Alzheimer's disease. It accounts for about 50 percent of the cases,
and there's no sign that aspirin helps that. However, about 30
percent of elderly senility cases result from multi-infarct
dementia or a combination of that and Alzheimer's.
   In these people, an aspirin a day seems to hold off the ravages
of senility or even bring back lost mental assets, says Meyer, who
presented his evidence earlier this year at an American Heart
Association stroke conference.
   ``The public should be aware that dementia is not a hopeless
disease,'' he said.
   In a test on 70 elderly patients, half got an aspirin a day,
while the rest did not. Otherwise, the two groups were identical.
   ``After three years, it was quite apparent that the
aspirin-treated group did significantly better,'' said Meyer. ``We
stopped the study for ethical reasons. It wasn't fair to go on with
it.''
   There were four times as many deaths in the untreated patients,
and significant differences in their mental conditions. It is
considered unethical to continue withholding from people a
treatment that seems overwhelmingly advantageous.
   Meyer regularly administered IQ tests as a way of judging the
subjects' mental fitness. Over the three years, the scores of the
aspirin group improved about 18 percent, while those of the
untreated people fell 5 percent.
   Tests also showed that blood flow inside the brain increased
among aspirin patients but worsened in the others.
   In general, the aspirin seemed to stabilize the disease or even
reverse it. Some elderly people became well enough that their
spouses could care for them at home. Others were able to drive
again or even go back to work.
   Meyer recommends that people have their relatives evaluated to
see if their mental problems are caused by Alzheimer's or
multi-infarct dementia. And if strokes are the cause, he believes
they should be put on daily aspirin.
   Other doctors seem intrigued by the evidence of another use for
aspirin.
   ``If it prevents stroke, that may be a clear reason for using
it'' in people with multi-infarct dementia, said Dr. Thomas R.
Price of the University of Maryland.
   Most strokes occur when a blood clot sticks in one of the
arteries that carries blood to the brain. When its lifeline is cut
off this way, some of the brain dies. Aspirin works by making blood
less likely to clot, which seems to prevent the small strokes from
occurring.
   Dr. Michael Harrison of Middlesex Hospital in London said there
may be a logical explanation for the improvement aspirin seems to
cause: The drug may stop pieces of clots from breaking away in the
large arteries and getting stuck in the small blood vessels that
feed the brain. If so, damaged brain tissue might heal if it isn't
continually assaulted by new little strokes.

   William Barklow has been eavesdropping
on a 25-million-year-old conversation nobody fully understands,
using modern techniques in an effort to solve the mystery of the
loons.
   ``We know very little about them,'' said Barklow, a Framingham
State College biology professor who has spent more than 14 years
studying the elusive member of the duck family. ``We don't know how
long they live. We don't know how many there are. There's a lot of
unanswered questions.''
   Barklow travels the northern New England woods from spring until
winter, recording the calls of male loons. Female loons are silent.
   He theorizes that loons have a system of communication which
includes the ``yodel'' and the ``laugh,'' the latter a warning to
flee from danger.
   The recorded yodels, believed to be signals of aggression, are
converted to voice prints to track and identify the loons, which
are difficult to catch and band since they spend virtually their
whole lives on water.
   ``In this way there is no intrusion. If you band a loon, you
must catch it. This way, they are not disturbed,'' Barklow said,
adding that only a few naturalists use ``voice'' patterns to track
animals.
   Since each male loon's call is slightly different, he can match
the voice prints to make identifications. One loon he tracked has
been returning to a northern Maine lake for 9{ years after
wintering in the Atlantic Ocean.
   In addition to helping determine lifespan and numbers, the voice
patterns could give insights into behavior and the effects of
chemical contamination, he said. ``They are very sensitive to human
development. In some cases they've been chased by boats on lakes.
They really like to be left undisturbed.''
   The four species of loons range around the world in northern
latitudes. They are plentiful in the arctic but threatened in the
southern edge of their habitat, such as Maine and central New
Hampshire, said Barklow, who has tracked loons as far south as
Walden Pond in Massachusetts.
   Barklow has put out pleas from New England to Alaska for
recordings of yodels, and is studying two baby loons in New
Hampshire to determine how the calls are learned. ``All this takes
a very long time,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the reclusive loons have become quite a sensation,
Barklow said. ``There's something very haunting and ethereal about
the calls.''
   An album of calls he recorded in the 1970s has sold nearly
90,000 copies. Calls also have been used in a production by the San
Francisco Ballet, the film ``On Golden Pond,'' and an upcoming
movie, ``The Far North,'' by Sam Shepard.

<HEAD>People With Potentially Deadly Allergies Need Epinephrine</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anaphylaxis, a potentially deadly allergic
reaction to stings, drugs and food, can be eased by the stimulant
epinephrine, but studies show many people don't carry the medicine
and many more don't know they should.
   ``If you had an episode of anaphylaxis, you're likely to have
another,'' said Dr. Bruce Wolf, a Nashville, Tenn., allergist.
``Because this reaction can be fatal, you need to have

   Anaphylaxis can kill by causing shock _ a heart- and

elderly people who have suffered such multiple small strokes, which
kill parts of their brains.
   By far the biggest cause of dementia in the elderly is
Alzheimer's disease. It accounts for about 50 percent of the cases,
and there's no sign that aspirin helps that. However, about 30
percent of elderly senility cases result from multi-infarct
dementia or a combination of that and Alzheimer's.
   In these people, an aspirin a day seems to hold off the ravages
of senility or even bring back lost mental assets, says Meyer, who
presented his evidence earlier this year at an American Heart
Association stroke conference.
   In a test on 70 elderly patients, half got an aspirin a day, the
rest did not. Over three years, the aspirin group's IQ scores
improved about 18 percent and the others fell 5 percent. There also
were four times as many deaths in the untreated patients, and
significant differences in their mental conditions.
   It is considered unethical to withhold a treatment that seems
advantageous, so the study was stopped, Meyer said.
   Dr. Michael Harrison of Middlesex Hospital in London said the
drug may stop pieces of clots from breaking away in the large
arteries and getting stuck in the small blood vessels to the brain.
If so, damaged brain tissue might heal if it isn't continually
assaulted by new little strokes.

<HEAD>Animal Communication Specialist Takes Sound Approach To Loon Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Barklow has been eavesdropping
on a 25-million-year-old conversation nobody fully understands,
using modern techniques in an effort to solve the mystery of the
loons.
   ``We know very little about them,'' said Barklow, a Framingham
State College biology professor who has spent more than 14 years
studying the elusive member of the duck family. ``We don't know how
long they live. We don't know how many there are. There's a lot of
unanswered questions.''
   Barklow theorizes that loons have a system of communication
which includes the ``yodel'' and the ``laugh,'' the latter a
warning to flee from danger.
   He converts the recorded yodels, believed to be signals of
aggression, to voice prints to track and identify the loons, which
are difficult to catch and band since they spend virtually their
whole lives on water.
   ``In this way there is no intrusion. If you band a loon, you
must catch it. This way, they are not disturbed,'' Barklow said,
adding that only a few naturalists use ``voice'' patterns to track
animals.
   Since each male loon's call is slightly different, he can match
the voice prints to make identifications. Female loons are silent.
   In addition to helping determine lifespan and numbers, the voice
patterns could give insights into behavior and the effects of
chemical contamination, he said. ``They are very sensitive to human
development. In some cases they've been chased by boats on lakes.
They really like to be left undisturbed.''

   The U.S. trade deficit widened to $10.9
billion in May, but was still the second smallest imbalance in
almost three years.
   The Reagan administration and private economists said Friday's
report by the Commerce Department proves the government is dealing
successfully with one of the country's biggest economic problems.
   The May deficit was $627 million higher than a revised April
imbalance of $10.3 billion. The April figure was the smallest
deficit since a $9.9 billion trade gap in August 1985.

   Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in June, but the drought pushed raw food prices up 4.2 percent, the
biggest rise in that category since October 1985, the government
says.
   The Labor Department said Friday the hot, dry weather sent
prices of unprocessed grain and poultry soaring by more than 20
percent last month.
   Food prices rose 1.1 percent at the wholesale level, one step
before retail stores. Economists said it was only a matter of time
before price bulges show up on supermarket shelves.

   U.S. industrial production, boosted by heavy
demand for electricity during the summer heat wave, climbed 0.4
percent in June, the ninth consecutive month without a decline, the
government said.
   The Federal Reserve said Friday the June advance followed
identical gains of 0.5 percent in both April and May and left
output 5.8 percent higher than it was a year ago.
   Analysts said the continued improvement showed American
manufacturers were still benefiting from an export boom.

strongly, easing economists' worries that too many goods are
accumulating on shelves and back lots.
   The Commerce Department said Friday inventories rose 0.6 percent
to a seasonally adjusted $728.4 billion, while sales rose 0.9
percent to $483.7 billion.
   The May gain in inventories followed a 0.5 percent climb in
April and was the strongest since a 0.7 percent increase in January.

airline a step closer to its goal of financial revival.
   In return for the agreement Friday by the Transport Workers
union to freeze wages, Pan Am withdrew its threat made last month
to sell a large portion of its assets. The airline had sought a 10
percent cut in wages.
   The agreement, covering about 5,200 mechanics, aircraft service

   Fat-removal surgery and the need for
garments that cinch and shape new body contours has transformed an
abandoned grocery store into a bustling factory in this rural
Minnesota town.
   ``It's not a fad,'' said Bonnie Pina, owner and
secretary-treasurer of Pina Productions, the largest employer in
this western Minnesota town of 152. ``It's something there's a call
for all the time.''
   The 15 jobs the plant has brought to this community, hit hard by
the farming crisis, and most recently, the drought, have played an
important role in the local economy.
   The company also makes a variety of medical garments for people
who have had abdominal surgery, facelifts and other operations. But
its ``girdles'' used to compress and reshape bodies following
liposuction _ a method by which fat cells are sucked from the body
_ are the company's hottest seller, Pina said.
   ``Everybody was really excited (when it opened) and made
comments about how good it was to see cars on the street again,''
said Linda Wall, the factory's manager and Pina's sister. ``It had
gotten quiet here for a while.''
   Unless the drought ends soon, ``it's probably going to be real
important,'' Wall said.
   Pina, who founded the Carrollton, Texas-based company in 1984,
said she decided to open the plant in Danvers because she grew up
here and knew people in the area had a strong work ethic.
   ``Rural people are real stable, and you don't have the turnover
you have elsewhere,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   She said she purchased the 80-year-old former grocery last
spring for $3,600 with the help of local loans and grants. The
company didn't show a profit last year because of the purchase and
training costs, but Pina said she expects to see a ``very good''
return this year.
   The walls of the one-room sewing shop, located in a
weather-beaten building on the town's main street, are lined with
spools of thread, material and pictures of the Minnesota Twins
baseball players.
   Pat Ostby, a Pina Productions employee since the Danvers
facility opened last summer, hadn't worked outside her home for 26
years but said she couldn't pass up the opportunity to work in her
own ``backyard.''
   ``What's happened to our rural communities is we're dying,''
said Ostby, whose husband operates a nearby dairy farm. ``To have
something like this come along can really build us up again.''
   Production for the garments peaks in the spring ``just before
bikini season,'' and ``just before the holidays'' in the fall, Pina
said.
   Cosmetic surgery such as liposuction is on the upswing, said
Pina, because the ``baby-boom'' generation is approaching 40 and
starting to sag.
   Liposuction candidates typically are in the higher income
bracket, as the typical suction job runs anywhere from $1,000 to
more than $5,000.
   Pina described the instrument used in liposuction as similar to
a vacuum cleaner. The compression garments are needed to reshape
the body, speed the healing process and control blood clotting, she
said.
   ``Society as a whole has become so vain about appearances,''
Pina said.
   The compression garments, which are applied immediately after
surgery, must be made with a great deal of precision because a seam
in the wrong spot can leave a permanent mark in the patient's skin,
Pina said. The garments, made of spandex-nylon, generally are not
taken off for six weeks.
   ``Use of a wrong garment or a faulty seam can mar someone for
life,'' she said. The compression garment serves as a kind of
``second skin.''
   ``They need that constant pressure to put the fat cells and
muscles back together again,'' she said.
   The most frequently used garment, to tighten suctioned buttocks
or thighs, resembles a skin-tone, long-legged girdle. The so-called
compression girdle has a 4-inch elastic band at the waist and runs
down to just above the knee. Versions are made for both men and
women.
   The company also produces wraps for other parts of the body,
including the rib cage, chin, neck and arms.
   Before compression garments became popular, doctors wrapped
patients in large bandages, but they were not as effective, Pina
said.
   In addition to its Danvers plant, Pina Productions also employs
eight in Carrollton, said Pina, who owns the company with her
husband, Albert Pina. All of the research and development,
marketing and sales are conducted through the Texas office, but
most of the sewing is done in Minnesota.
   The garments are turned over to wholesalers, who sell them
mainly to plastic surgery clinics and hospitals, she said.
   Pina said she is considering expanding as soon as she is
confident they can handle the increased workload.
   ``Our possibilities are endless,'' she said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up; Stocks Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar jumped a hefty 1.75 yen to close trading
today at 135.15 yen, its highest closing in Tokyo in eight months.
Stock prices continued their fall from last week.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which lost 170.29 points Friday, fell another 251.67 points, or
0.91 percent, to close the day's trading at 27,662.12 points.
   The dollar began trading today at 135.33 yen, 1.93 yen higher
than Friday's close of 133.40 yen, and ranged between 135.00-135.43
yen.
   The dollar's rise followed similar movement in overseas markets,
a Bank of Tokyo foreign exchange dealer said. The U.S. currency
closed at 135.45 yen in New York last Friday.
   Friday's announcement that the U.S. trade deficit rose slightly
in May to $10.9 billion _ far less than the $12 billion expected by
market players in Tokyo _ boosted the U.S. currency, said the
dealer, who spoke on the condition he not be identified.
   ``The market responded favorably to the news that the U.S. trade
balance moved in the direction of improvement,'' the dealer said.
   A Finance Ministry official told a private meeting of ministry
officials and a Japanese businessmen's organization the present
exchange movements reflect sustained improvement in the U.S. trade
balance and U.S. economic growth and price stability.
   ``It's not necessary to worry about these levels'' as they are
still within a range that represents stability, the unidentified
official was quoted as saying by a representative of the
organization.
   A Bank of Tokyo dealer said the 138 yen-level would be the
``danger zone'' at which the Bank of Japan may intervene if the
pace of the dollar's rise is too quick.
   Traders said the central bank did not interfere in the market to
support the yen.
   The stock market weakened despite predictions by traders last
week that export issues, especially electricals, could surge with a
higher dollar.
   ``Generally there was little activity,'' said Hitomi Sakano of
Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage. ``With the high
dollar, bond prices fell and investors stayed on the sidelines,''
although there was limited trading in steels and electricals, she
said.
   Several banks, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sumitomo, were
suspended early in the session due to an excess of selling orders.
   Traders said that although the firmer dollar helped electricals
and some other exporters, the higher dollar also reignited fears of
rising interest rates.
   ``The whole thing was interest-rate fear related, and of course
all the interest rate-sensitive stocks took a beating,'' one trader
said.
   Volume in the first section was estimated at 1.1 billion shares,
down by nearly half from 2.0 billion shares Friday.

   The stock market declined broadly today amid
renewed worries over the outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 16.54 to 2,112.91
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 5 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 304 up, 737 down and
409 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.73 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said many traders were concerned that continuing
strength in the economy would exert upward pressure on interest
rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, dropped as much as $5 for each
$1,000 in face value in early activity today.
   On the plus side, brokers say earnings reports for the second
quarter should serve as a support for stock prices over the next
few weeks.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone & Telegraph
was unchanged at 26|; International Business Machines was steady at
125{, and Exxon slipped [ to 46{.
   MCI Communications, the most active over-the-counter issue, rose
\ to 16]. The company reported that its second-quarter earnings
increased to 25 cents a share from 3 cents in the comparable period
last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.02 to 152.63. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .49 at 308.82.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.83 to
2,129.45, finishing the week with a net gain of 23.30.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 785 up, 619 down and 533 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 199.71 million shares, against 172.41 million in the
previous session.

<NOTE>Eds: updates with other banks increasing rate.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's commercial banks, heeding a signal from
the Bank of England, on Monday announced a half-point increase in
their base lending rate to 10.5 percent.
   The increase in the benchmark lending rate was the sixth
half-point since early June, when the rate stood at 7.5 percent.
The rate was last increased July 4.
   The rate increases reflect the government's desire to curb
inflation.
   The Bank of England signaled the rise by announcing it was
raising its own money market rates.
   Midland Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, National Westminster Bank
PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC responded by announcing increases in their
rate.
   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at 1 percentage point above
the base rate.
   The pound fell, rather than rose, on the latest increase,
because the market was disappointed that the central bank did not
signal a full point increase in base rates, dealers said.
   The pound was trading at $1.6580 after the central bank's
signal, down from $1.6620 just before.
   Britain's annual rate rose to 4.6 percent in June from 4.2
percent in the previous month, the government reported Thursday.
Other recent British economic reports have indicated a rekindling
of inflation.
   The dollar's recent rally, and a simultaneous decline in the
British pound, have given the government room to increase interest
rates to curb consumer spending without fear of pushing the pound
up far enough to hurt British exports and corporate earnings.
   The Bank of England said the rise in rates represents ``a
further tightening of monetary conditions'' but declined to specify
what economic developments had triggered the move.
   A Treasury official, who was not identified in accordance with
British custom, said this rise continues the process of tightening
of policy that has taken place since the beginning of June. Since
then, he stressed, base rates had risen by a full 3 points and so
there has been ``significant tightening.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. on Monday
announced steps to shrink its marketing and services headquarters
staffs, spelling out some details of a recently announced $600
million streamlining program.
   IBM said it would consolidate three organizations into one,
named US Marketing & Services, that will be run by a smaller
management team.
   Heading the new organization will be George H. Conrades, a
senior vice president who was general manager of IBM Personal
Systems, the personal computer organization.
   Edward E. Lucente, an IBM vice president who was group executive
for a predecessor organization, the US Marketing & Services Group,
has been given the assignment of implementing the $600 million
program of staff and manufacturing consolidations.
   IBM says the consolidations are expected to lead to the
retirement or resignation of 3,000 to 4,000 employees. In addition
to cutting costs, IBM says its streamlining is intended to bring
its marketing activities closer to customers.
   IBM spokesman Peter Judice said the new assignments given to
several executives should not be regarded as either promotions or
demotions.
   ``The guys at this level get a variety of assignments throughout
their career. At the executive level, the word promotion is not
used. These are new assignments. That's s.o.p. (standard operating
procedure) for IBM.''
   In addition to the US Marketing & Services Group, the new
marketing organization will incorporate two marketing divisions,
North-Central and South-West, which will no longer exist.

<HEAD>Rain Sends Grain, Soybean Futures Sharply Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy weekend rains in the drought-stricken
Midwest sent grain and soybean futures plummeting today on the
Chicago Board of Trade as panicked traders reacted to renewed hopes
of saving the crops.
   ``I would describe this price plunge as a train wreck; I'd
describe it as the biggest weather shocker of the summer,'' said
Rich Feltes, director of commodities research for Refco Inc., a
large, Chicago-based trading firm.
   July soybeans plunged more than $1 a bushel within minutes of
the opening.
   The National Weather Service had predicted a week of hot, dry
weather in the Corn Belt in its forecasts issued last week. But
today's private forecasts called for rain today and Tuesday in the
region followed by relatively cool temperatures through Thursday.
   ``I think people are sensing the (drought) pattern may be
breaking up,'' Feltes said. ``No one knows for certain, but we've
bought some important time for the 50 percent of the corn crop that
has not yet pollinated and certainly for the soybeans, which could
approach yields that are above what the market's been trading.''
   Prices on most grain and soybean contracts plunged their
permissable limits at the opening. But the contracts for July
delivery, on which limits have been removed pending their
expiration on Thursday, fell freely.
   In early trading, wheat was 18 cents to 24 cents lower with the
July contract at $3.60 a bushel; corn was 15 cents to 28{ cents
lower with July at $3.05 a bushel; oats were 15 cents to 26{ cents
lower with July at $2.85 a bushel; soybeans were 45 cents to $1.04{
lower with July at $8.90 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were widely mixed in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were 1.20 cents lower to .83 cent higher with August
at 65.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to the limit
1.50 cents higher with August at 76.25 cents a pound; hogs were .02
cent to the limit 1.50 cents lower with July at 46.15 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were the limit 2 cents lower to .08 cent
higher with July at 37.25 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Friday.

   As Japan's economic influence spreads around the
world, computers are tackling the job of translating Japanese
documents _ and spoken words _ into English and other languages.
   Translating can be an expensive and time-consuming task for many
Japanese companies, especially those whose products are primarily
aimed at foreign markets.
   One answer, says Fujitsu, a major computer manufacturer, is its
computer-aided translation system, first marketed in 1984 and now
being upgraded.
   ``In every company, piles of documents are just waiting to be
translated,'' Shigeru Sato, a director at Fujitsu Laboratory, said.
``A need is felt to speed up information exchanges on a global
basis.''
   Sato said Fujitsu's $30,000 Automatic Translation System, or
Atlas, can translate Japanese documents into English about 30
percent faster than average human translators.
   ``We are hoping to increase the efficiency of translation up to
50 percent in three years,'' said Hiroshi Uchida, a systems
engineer for Fujitsu.
   If that improvement is achieved, said John Mackin, a manager at
Fujitsu's documentation department, which uses the Atlas system,
``we can get rid of the bottom half of low-quality translators.
That will increase the quality of translation drastically while
cutting costs.''
   Sato said Fujitsu also has developed a verbal translation system
that translates spoken Japanese into English and vice versa.
   The system is a combination of Atlas and a voice recognition
system. If the latter recognizes a sentence in Japanese, it
converts the sentence into written Japanese and sends it to the
Atlas, which translates it to English, and a voicing system reads
the sentence in a synthetic voice.
   Sato acknowledged, however, that many difficulties lie ahead
before a complete computer translation system is achieved.
   ``The most difficult part was setting up a sufficient
dictionary,'' he said. The dictionary requires not only word by
word translation but also syntax, semantics, and context
translation, he said.
   For example, he said, the dictionary has to be able to
differentiate such sentences as ``I saw a bird with a telescope''
and ``I saw a bird with a ring.''
   ``The two may have the same grammatical structure but a
different usage,'' Sato said.
   Structural differences between Japanese and English also pose a
variety of problems, Sato said.
   ``In Japanese,'' he said, ``sentences seldom have a subject and
still can be understood.'' However, English sentences must have a
subject.''
   Also, Japanese sentences are often vague about singularity and
plurality of nouns, which must be stated clearly in English, he
said.
   The Atlas system at this stage of development does not help
reduce the number of translators companies need because ``it takes
highly trained translators to use Atlas correctly,'' said Mackin.
   Under the guidance and sponsorship of the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, eight Japanese computer
manufacturers, including Fujitsu Ltd., NEC Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and
Toshiba Corp., are jointly developing a complete dictionary system
that contains 200,000 words in both Japanese and English plus
100,000 special words.
   The ministry is investing $1.05 billion in the six-year project,
Sato said.
   Fujitsu's Sato said his company is the world's leader in
computer-aided translation and the only prospective rival at this
point would be Hitachi.
   He said Fujitsu has delivered to Japanese customers about 100
units of its Atlas system while Hitachi, Toshiba and NEC have sold
only 10 units altogether.
   He also said U.S. and European companies are behind Fujitsu in
this field because of less demand for Japanese-English translation
of documents and instruction manuals in the United States and
Europe.

<HEAD>Bellevue Hotel Reopens with New Grace</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>

   In a twist on the Bellevue Stratford Hotel's
1954 motto, ``old in grace, new in face,'' the current owners of
the historic building say they are going for ``new in grace, old in
face'' when the Grand Dame of Broad Street reopens later this year.
   Richard Rubin & Co. bought the Bellevue in 1978 for $8.5 million
and is spending $100 million to convert the famous hotel into a
multiple-use building housing a luxury hotel, offices, restaurants,
shops and a sports club.
   Since last July, construction workers have gutted much of the
interior in an effort to restore the grace and opulence of the
84-year-old structure.
   Restoring the tattered reputation of the Bellevue may be more
difficult. The hotel became linked to Legionnaires' Disease after
hosting an American Legion convention in 1976 and officials have
been trying to shake the indignity ever since.
   Four months after that July convention, 150 people fell ill and
29 people died from the mysterious ailment. The hotel was closed.
Since then, two different management companies have tried and
failed to revive the hotel, which closed again in 1986.
   Rubin company officials and the hotel's new management, Cunard
Hotels & Resorts, hope that changing the hotel into a multiple-use
building will also change the Bellevue's fortunes.
   Rubin corporate director of marketing Judy Morse said that the
real estate company decided to combine the hotel with a list of
renters that will include Ralph Lauren-Polo, the Sporting Club, and
Lewis, Gilman & Kynett, a Philadelphia advertising agency. Morse
said 70 percent of the building has been leased.
   Only the 12th through 19th floors will be occupied by the hotel;
floors 2 through 11 will be offices, and the remaining space will
be devoted to shops and restaurants.
   Guests will pay $170 a night for one of 170 rooms in the new
``Hotel Atop the Bellevue.'' The rooms include a television, VCR,
and a telephone with two lines in the bedroom, and a mini-tv and a
second telephone in the bathroom.
   Hotel manager Michael Duffell said he hopes to reach a 75
percent occupancy rate, which will present ``a friendly, personable
yet exclusive atmosphere'' for the guests.
   Duffell has 31 years of experience to draw on, which include
managing the Ritz Hotel in London and controller of the Royal
Palaces of King Hussein of Jordan.
   While the Bellevue may have new tenants, one former employee
said the hotel will retain its sense of history and tradition. John
T. Ryan, who has worked at the hotel since 1952 and was catering
services manager when the Bellevue closed two years ago, said the
hotel is part of the city's social life.
   ``Everyone who was of importance came to the Bellevue over the
years,'' Ryan said. Families, presidents from Teddy Roosevelt to
Ronald Reagan and celebrities came to the Bellevue for bar
mitzvahs, weddings, proms, national political party conventions,
society balls and union meetings.
   Mark Twain and J.P. Morgan stayed, and Harry S. Truman got word
of his nomination by the Democrats in the Hunt Room, off the right
corner of the lobby.
   ``The hotel is not a hotel,'' Ryan said, ``it's a historic
institution.''
   The Bellevue hotel, with more than 1,000 guest rooms, was built
in 1904 at a cost of $8 million by George C. Boldt, a Prussian
immigrant who entered the hotel business in 1881. Boldt was hired
by the Astor family to run the Waldorf Astoria in New York in 1898.
Four years later, he decided to open a hotel in Philadelphia.
   Boldt had his hotel designed in French Renaissance style. Thomas
Edison designed the lighting fixtures. Suites were decorated in
Colonial, French, Italian and Greek furnishings to suit the taste
of each guest, as Boldt wanted his hotel to be ``the most
magnificant in the United States, if not the world, no matter what
the cost.''
   On opening day, the hotel's 700 employees and 50 cooks served
4,200 meals and poured 7,000 drinks.
   Decades later, when the hotel hosted the American Legion
convention, manager William Chadwick predicted the hotel would
never recover. ``This story could mutilate the good name of the
Bellevue Stratford,'' he said.
   The hotel's occupancy rate dropped to 3 percent. Former
Phildelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo even suggested razing the Bellevue
and building a new hotel, one not contaminated by scandal. But
after a two-year, world-wide search, a new owner _ Rubin _ was
found to buy the building.
   Today, Rubin and Cunard officials remain touchy about the
hotel's association with Legionnaires' Disease. They point out that
since the virulent 1976 outbreak in Philadelphia, the disease has
been found all over the country and in Northern Europe as well.
   The developers believe the building's transformation will help
put the issue to rest once and for all. Ms. Morse said she has
turned away several requests for retail and office space. Hotel
manager Duffell expects the Academy of Music's annual ball to
return to the Bellevue as the hotel's first event after reopening
in December.
   And Jan L. Pollard, sales and marketing director for the new
hotel, said she has received a letter requesting room for a New
Year's Eve party _ in 1999.
   Charles Licata, of Voorhees, N.J., told Ms. Pollard that he met
and married his wife at the Bellevue. In addition, they've sailed
on the Cunard company's luxury liners, which include the Queen
Elizabeth 2.
   So naturally, when planning to usher in the new millenium, he
thought of the Bellevue.
   ``I was always taught to plan in advance,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Largest Independent Bank in Texas Operates With Caution</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAREDO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During the deregulated financial orgy of
the early 1980s that left many Texas banks in ruins, executives at
the conservative Laredo National Bank turned their backs on the
binge.
   In a manner unfashionable at the time, the bank remained
cautious and planned for long-term growth.
   Now, with more than $1 billion in assets, it is the largest
independent bank in the state, operating in a border community
where 13 percent of the people are out of work.
   ``Here amidst all of the problems that Texas is having, here is
a bank doing well on the Mexican border,'' observed Alex
Sheshunoff, president of an Austin-based consulting firm that bears
his name.
   Laredo is equidistant _ about 150 miles _ from San Antonio,
Texas, to the north; the industrial center of Monterrey, Nuevo
Leon, Mexico, to the south; and the deepwater port of Corpus
Christi, Texas, to the east.
   Max Mandel, chairman of the institution founded in 1892, credits
the bank's success to a simple formula: ``We felt we wanted to
stick to our knitting,'' he said. ``We wanted to stick to things
that we knew'' _ local real estate, import-export loans and
low-risk investments.
   The bank also dealt with people it could get to know: ``We've
offended some people when we refused to take their money because we
could not verify their character,'' president Gary Jacobs said.
   Other Texas institutions were not so prudent and overextended
themselves by investing in risky real estate schemes. Fifty-two
banks failed in 1987; 40 more failed the first six months of this
year.
   ``People were just getting too excited,'' said Mandel, who has
been with the bank since 1950. ``It was an unreal situation. We saw
the handwriting on the wall and pulled back.''
   Laredo's restraint is evident in its financial statements. LNB
had $1.13 billion on deposit at the end of June, but only $274
million, or 24 percent, was loaned out.
   Texas banks the same size or larger had loaned a median of 87.4
percent of their deposits at the end of 1987, according to Alex
Sheshunoff & Co.
   LNB's assets at the end of June totaled just under $1.22
billion, with investments weighted heavily toward low-risk _ albeit
lower-producing _ areas such as Treasury bills and U.S. securities.
   Bank president Jacobs attributes LNB's stability to its control
by a few families who rarely sell any of the stock. It maintains a
small-town philosophy that sounds anachronistic and almost corny in
an age of dealmaking.
   ``We have always felt a tremendous obligation that when people
deposit money in a financial institution, in your financial
institution, that they are trusting you with their money, and you
should always be able to give it back to them,'' Jacobs said.
   ``That's a very simplistic philosophy, but there's an old
banking proverb that I read somewhere: `Bankers should always spend
more time with depositors than with borrowers.'''
   Jacobs said the bank maintains a liquidity that would allow it
to pay off all depositors within a day or two, if it had to.
   ``Since it's a bank that's controlled by a few families, and
since it's not publicly traded and seeking to pyramid its value on
the stock exchange, it's perhaps been easier for us to maintain a
consistent philosophy,'' Jacobs said. ``... Much like the Japanese
take a longer view, we have been able to take a longer view of
things than many banks.''
   When the economy is strong, it takes more risk than during hard
times, when it focuses its money on low-risk areas that bring small
returns.
   ``For the past few years, we've really sacrificed earnings,''
Jacobs said.
   Deregulation beginning in the late 1970s, and continuing into
this decade, left banks too free to do themselves in when Texas'
oil and real estate markets collapsed, Jacobs said.
   Bankers, particularly in Houston and Dallas, understood energy
loans and could have survived had they not moved recklessly into
real estate speculation, which they did not understand, he said.
   Jacobs and Mandel said ``merger mania'' also brought some of the
larger holding companies down as they drained the life out of
smaller banks they acquired.
   ``Instead of growing the banks more slowly with legitimate
deposit growth from their primary markets, markets they understood,
they would go out and buy growth,'' Jacobs said. ``A Dallas bank
would go out and buy an El Paso bank, a San Angelo bank and then go
find these little pockets of profitability'' to keep stock analysts
happy.
   Mandel said the 1982 collapse of the Mexican peso and a few
problem loans in Mexico also were sobering experiences for LNB, and
probably kept it from taking more risk than it might have.
Laredo's-still struggling retail sector has kept loan demand ...

   United Technologies Corp. said Monday
that its earnings increased 26 percent in the second quarter of
1988 and its chairman said he expects the company to have record
results for the year.
   UTC said it had net income of $196.2 million, or $1.50 per
share, up from $156 million, or $1.19 per share, in the second
quarter of 1987.
   UTC said its revenues rose 4.7 percent to $4.5 billion in the
second quarter compared to $4.3 billion in the year-ago period.
   The latest results included a pretax gain of $41.4 million, or
19 cents per share, from the sale of its share of Telefunken
Electronic GmbH, a West German, semiconductor joint venture.
   ``Our second-quarter performance supports our continuing
expectation that we will achieve record results for the full
year,'' said Robert F. Daniell, the company's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Net income for the first six months of 1988 was $318.4 million,
or $2.44 per share, compared with $254.2 million, or $1.94 per
share, for the first half of 1987.
   Revenues for the first half of 1988 were $8.8 billion, compared
with $8.3 billion for the year-ago period.
   UTC is a broad-based designer and manufacturer of
high-technology products including Pratt & Whitney aircraft
engines, Carrier air conditioning systems, Otis elevators, Sikorsky
helicopters, Norden defense systems, Hamilton Standard aerospace
systems, and UT Automotive components and systems.

<HEAD>MCI Earnings Up Nine-Fold; BellSouth Earnings Up 3.7 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp.'s earnings rose more than nine-fold
from the depressed level of a year earlier, while BellSouth Corp.'s
rose 3.7 percent, the phone companies said Monday.
   MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance telephone
company, reported record net income of $73 million, or 25 cents per
share, for the second quarter ended June 30, compared with $8
million, or 3 cents per share, for the same period in 1987.
   The company also reported record revenues of $1.22 billion for
the second quarter of this year, 28 percent higher than the $952
million reported in the same 1987 quarter.
   MCI said the strongest revenue growth came from increased sales
of 800 and international services and ``continued penetration of
numerous large commercial accounts.''
   It said call volume was up 44.7 percent from a year earlier.
   Both this year's and last year's second-quarter earnings
included pre-tax gains from previously negotiated antitrust
settlements, $9 million in this year's quarter and $6 million in
the period last year.
   For the first six months of this year, MCI had net income of
$142 million, or 49 cents per share, on sales of $2.4 billion,
compared with $33 million, or 12 cents per share, on sales of $1.9
billion.
   BellSouth, the Atlanta-based regional Bell holding company for
the Southeast, said it earned $396 million, or 83 cents a share, up
from $382 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 6.3 percent to $3.21 billion from $3.02 billion.
   For the first six months of this year, BellSouth said its
earnings fell 1 percent to $827 million, or $1.72 a share, from
$835 million, or $1.74 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6
percent to $6.33 billion from $5.97 billion a year earlier.
   BellSouth said its results were helped by continuing growth in
both regulated and unregulated businesses. It said expenses
increased partly because of the acquisition and consolidation of
new businesses.

   The stock market showed a broad loss today amid
renewed worries over the outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 14.41 points to
2,115.04 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 418 up, 873
down and 491 unchanged.
   Analysts said many traders were concerned that continuing
strength in the economy would exert upward pressure on interest
rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, dropped as much as $5 for each
$1,000 in face value in early activity today.
   On the plus side, brokers say earnings reports for the second
quarter should serve as a support for stock prices over the next
few weeks.
   MCI Communications, the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market, rose ~ to 17. The company reported that
its second-quarter earnings increased to 25 cents a share from 3
cents in the comparable period last year.
   Apple Computer, another prominent OTC stock, gained | to 45| on

   Automaker Rover Group PLC said Monday it plans to
close two plants over the next few years, cutting 3,400 jobs.
   The company, which currently employs 46,400 people, said it will
phase out its car assembly plant in Cowley South, Oxford, by the
early 1990s and will shut its pressings factory in Llanelli, Wales,
in two years.
   Rover Chairman Graham Day said the company was suffering from
over-capacity and wants to concentrate its production at two big
plants. Small and medium cars will be made at Longbridge in the
West Midlands, while larger models will be made at Cowley in
Oxford, he said.
   British Aerospace PLC is acquiring state-owned Rover from the
British government for $252 million. The government is injecting
$919 million into the automaker to reduce its debt.

   Communications Satellite Corp. Monday reported
second-quarter earnings of $17.6 million, or 96 cents per share,
compared with a loss of $83.8 million in the same quarter last year
due to corporate restructuring.
   The company said revenues in the quarter ended June 30 were
$88.9 million, up from $88.2 million reported in the same period
last year.
   Growth in the International Maritime Satellite Organization's
business activities and beginning of services in new hotels by
Comsat Video Enterprises Inc. accounted for the higher revenues.
   The increases were offset, however, by declining revenues in its
Systems division, which provides integrated networks for domestic
and foreign governments and military and civilian agencies, Comsat
said.
   In the first half of this year, Comsat had earnings of $31.9
million, or $1.73 per share, on revenues of $173 million, compared
with a loss of $75.4 million and revenues of $168.9 million in the
same 1987 period.
   Comsat provides international, domestic and maritime
telecommunications services and represents the United States in
Intelsat and Inmarsat.

<TEXT>
   Prices finished lower Monday on the London Stock
Exchange, but analysts blamed it on technical factors in the market
rather than on increases in some key lending rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 12.2
points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,849.3.
   Trading volume fell to 366.4 million shares from Friday's 591.5
million shares.
   Dealers said the stock market largely ignored a half-point rise
in the commercial banks' base rate to 10.5 percent because the move
already had been factored into trading.
   Several dealers attributed the decline in stock prices to the
fact that a handful of 100-share index stocks began trading
``ex-dividend,'' which means Friday was the last day buyers could
buy the stocks and still receive their next dividends. That
encouraged selling on Monday, the dealers said.
   The Bank of England raised its own money market rates on Monday,
and commercial banks later followed suit by boosting their base
lending rates.
   Analysts remain divided over how high rates will eventually
rise, but few doubt that further increases are on the way, possibly
as soon as midweek.
   ``People are now asking where the next step is and I have to say
it (the base rate) isn't going lower,'' said Roger Charlesworth,
senior dealer at Chase Manhattan Securities in London.

<TEXT>
   Operating rates at American factories, mines
and utilities rose in June to 83.1 percent, the third consecutive
monthly increase and the highest level in more than eight years,
the government said today.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the 0.2 percentage point rise
from the May level put operating rates at their highest levels
since March 1980, when industry operated at 83.7 percent of
capacity.
   It was the seventh increase in nine months. Operating rates rose
by 0.2 percentage points in April and 0.3 percentage points in May.
   Rising operating rates, if unchecked, are considered by analysts
to represent a threat of inflation. The concern is that if
companies have difficulty meeting demand, prices will rise.
   The June level of 83.1 percent was 2.8 percentage points higher
than a year ago, but still well below the 85 percent overall
operating rate that economists say clearly signals inflation.
   However, the mix of operating rates in the Federal Reserve
report may ease inflation fears somewhat.
   The operating rate at manufacturing plants held steady at 83.2
percent. A 0.1 percentage point increase to 81.7 percent at plants
making durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items expected to last three
or more years _ was offset by a 0.2 percentage point decline to
85.2 percent at plants making nondurable goods.
   The operating rates in a number of industries where capacity is
tightest dropped: petroleum products, from 85.5 percent in May to
84.5 percent in June; textiles, from 91.8 percent in April to 90.7
percent in May, the latest month available, and rubber and
plastics, from 88.1 percent in April to 87.3 percent in May.
   The rate at paper plants increased by 0.1 percentage point to
95.0 percent in May, but that was below the 97 percent peak last
December. The rate at chemical plants rose 0.2 percentage points to
86.2 percent in May.
   Economists say surging sales of U.S. goods abroad, in response
to the devaluation of the dollar over the past three years, have
been responsible for pushing operating rates higher. However, so
far growth in domestic demand has slowed enough to accommodate
production for export.
   The operating rate in the mining industry, which includes oil
drilling, rose from 81.4 percent to 82.1 percent in June.
   At utilities, the June rate jumped 2.0 percentage points to 81.8
percent. Electric utilities, which increased output to keep air
conditioners going during the heat wave, had an operating rate of
85.4 percent, up 2.6 percentage points over May.
   Among steelmakers and other metals manufacturing, the rate was
down 0.2 percentage points to 87.2 percent in June. Manufacturers
of motor vehicles and parts reported a June drop of 0.3 percentage
points to 83.4 percent. The decline followed three steep increases
from the 76.8 percent rate in February.

week and is expected to resume his duties in a matter of weeks,
company officials said Monday.
   Wohlstetter, 78, was stricken Thursday and is hospitalized at
New York University Medical Center. A statement from Donald W.
Weber, the company's president and chief executive officer, said
Wohlstetter was making ``good progress'' and his absence would not

<HEAD>Rig Count Decreased by 27 to 899</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States dipped by 27 this week, or about 3 percent, to 899,
the industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   During the previous week, the company said the rig count had
increased by 5 to total 926.
   But this week Oklahoma reported 18 fewer working rigs and
Mississippi, hampered by rains that bogged production efforts,
reported 10 fewer rigs, said Ike Kerridge, an economist with Baker
Hughes. Louisiana dropped by seven.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas had the biggest gain
with four, followed by Colorado, Kansas and Wyoming with three each.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
The rig count totaled 922 a year ago.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises In Volatile Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly higher Monday in seesaw
European trading, buffeted by central bank intervention and news of
a possible breakthrough in the protracted Iran-Iraq war. Gold
prices fell.
   Despite the dollar's volatile behavior, foreign currency dealers
said market participants remained optimistic about the U.S.
currency. They offered a few key reasons for the downward pressure.
   Some said a large sell order was responsible, along with
intervention by the American, British and West German central banks.
   Others attributed it to news that Iran had unconditionally
accepted a U.N. resolution for a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf
war. Investors often consider the dollar to be a safe investment
during times of international tension.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 1.75 yen to a closing 135.15 yen. Later in London it
was quoted at the higher rate of 134.75 yen.
   The British pound swung sharply. It rose in the morning, then
fell following a half-point increase in the British commercial
banks' base lending rate to 10.5 percent, which was smaller than
the markets had expected. Later, the pound recovered to finish
higher.
   Late Monday, it cost $1.6693 to buy one pound compared with
$1.6635 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday:
1.8823 West German marks, up from 1.8780; 1.5625 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5555; 6.3415 French francs, up from 6.3285; 2.1130 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1150; 1,390.50 Italian lire, up from
1,387.25; 1.2095 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2117.
   Gold prices fell under pressure from the U.S. currency's surge
and on the Persian Gulf news, bullion dealers said.
   Gold closed in London at a bid price of $436.25 a troy ounce,
down from $438.40 late Friday. In Zurich, the late bid price was
$435, down from $439. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.86 to $440.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $7.13 a troy
ounce, down from $7.30 Friday.

<HEAD>Swiss Firm To Buy Elevator Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Monday it
plans to sell its elevator business to a Swiss competitor,
Schindler Holding A.G., for an undisclosed sum of cash.
   The company said a letter of intent covers Westinghouse
manufacturing operations in Gettysburg, Pa., and Randolph, N.J.,
the division headquarters in Morristown, N.J., and numerous
subsidiaries and sales and service offices throughout North America.
   The business employs about 5,500 people primarily serving the
United States. Schindler is expected under the agreement to offer
jobs to the entire workforce, Westinghouse said.
   Schindler, like Westinghouse, makes, sells and services a broad
range of elevators and escalators. The Swiss firm has annual
worldwide sales of $1.4 billion and about 22,000 employees.
   Westinghouse anticipates a substantial gain on the sale, said
Chairman John C. Marous.
   ``Key growth areas, such as broadcasting, financial services,
environmental services, communications and commercial electronic
systems related to our highly successful defense business continue
to be attractive investment and business opportunities,'' Marous
said. ``We currently are considering several enhancing acquisition
opportunities which are strategically related to some of our
high-growth, high-profit businesses.''

<HEAD>United Makes Pilots Better Offer Than Buyout Portends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines has offered its pilots a
five-year contract that may be attractive enough to persuade them
to abandon their $4 billion bid to buy the airline, industry
analysts said Monday.
   ``The pilots will have to withdraw their buyout offer before
(negotiations) get serious,'' said Kevin Murphy, airline analyst
for Morgan Stanley & Co. of New York.
   The proposed contract requires no wage concessions by the 5,500
pilots and offers pay raises to recently hired pilots, according to
a report in Monday's editions of the Chicago Tribune.
   The pilots' buyout offer of $110 per share in cash would require
pilots to make substantial concessions, including a 10-year, 25
percent pay cut.
   ``What the pilots have designed as part of their takeover plan
is Draconian givebacks,'' said Edward Starkman, an analyst in New
York with PaineWebber Inc. ``I can't imagine they'd be too thrilled
with it and they haven't been.''
   Pilots of other airlines, including Eastern and Pan Am, agreed
to wage cuts of up to 20 percent in their most recent contracts,
said Candace Browning, an analyst with Wertheim, Schroeder & Co. in
New York.
   ``In light of the buyout bid and in light of what other airlines
are asking for, it seems like a very attractive offer,'' Ms.
Browning said.
   Neither the airline nor the pilots' union, the United Master
Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association, would comment
on the contract proposal or the ongoing negotiations. The previous
pact expired in April, said union spokesman Hank Krakowski.
   Krakowksi said the contract proposal was not connected with the
pilots' buyout offer, formally known as an Employee Stock Ownership
Plan.
   ``It just happens that we have contract negotiations going on
concurrent with the ESOP effort,'' he said. ``They're two separate
subjects completely.''
   United's reported proposal for a 5-year freeze on the salaries
of senior pilots and a cumulative 10 percent raise for about 1,100
pilots hired since 1985 is in line with ALPA's longstanding demand
that airlines do away with two-scale wage systems, Starkman said.
   Annual salares for United pilots range from $21,600 for a
first-year, Boeing 727 flight engineer to $152,000 for a Boeing 747
captain.
   United's proposal also calls for an 8 percent increase in pilot
productivity, the Tribune reported. In return, United pledged to
remain committed to the airline business and to provide more
opportunity for promotions through expansion, the newspaper said.
   United has had a prickly relationship with its pilots since a
29-day pilot strike in 1985.
   The pilots' offer to buy the airline hinges on the outcome of
their lawsuit challenging anti-takeover provisions in United's
contract with the International Association of Machinists.
   Murphy said the proposal was the first specific package
presented at the bargaining table since contract negotiations began
in February. He said he expected no concrete results from
negotiations before the end of the year.

   Hospital Corp. of America, one of the
nation's largest hospital management companies, said Monday its
second-quarter profit rose 15 percent despite a 21 percent decline
in revenue.
   The company said its profit rose to $70.8 million, or $1 a
share, for the three months ended June 30 compared with $61.3
million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue fell to $1.02 billion from $1.29 billion
a year earlier. The 1987 figures, however, included $400 million
from hospitals that were sold last fall.
   In September 1987, HCA sold 104 of its least profitable
hospitals. When the figures are adjusted to assume the sale took
place at the beginning of 1987, profits were about 18 percent
higher and sales were up 14 percent in the second quarter of 1988.
   The latest results reflected an increase in income of about $6
million from the sale of certain investments and properties.
   For the first six months of the year, HCA said its profit rose
nearly 17 percent to $151.8 million, or $2.13 a share, from $141.5
million, or $1.72 a share in 1987.
   Six-month revenue fell 20.1 percent to $2.07 billion from $2.59
billion a year earlier.
   HCA owns nearly 200 hospitals and manages more than 200 others.

<HEAD>Bass Begins Tender Offer For Macmillan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert M. Bass Group on Monday began a
sweetened, $1.9 billion tender offer for Macmillan Inc. just days
after winning a court victory against the publisher's
reorganization plan.
   The Texas-based Bass group said it will pay $75-a-share a share
in cash for the Macmillan shares it does not already own. Bass
controls about 9.9 percent of the publisher's 25.9 million
outstanding common shares.
   In a letter outlining details of its offer to the Macmillan
board, the Bass group said it planned to keep Macmillan in ``one
piece'' and has ``no plans to dispose of any part of the company or
merge it with any other enterprise.''
   The tender offer represents the second time Bass has improved
its bid for New York-based Macmillan. Until Monday Bass had a
$73-a-share bid on the table.
   A Macmillan spokeswoman said the company had no comment on the
tender offer.
   The offer comes just days after the Bass group won a key legal
victory in halting Macmillan's defensive restructuring plan. The
publisher unveiled the plan after Bass first discussed the
possibility of a takeover at $64 a share in May.
   Last week, a Delaware Chancery Court judge issued a preliminary
injunction preventing Macmillan from proceeding with the
restructuring, which included payment of a special dividend and
splitting the company into two separate, publicly traded entities:
publishing and information services.
   The Bass group had said it would go ahead with the tender offer
if it won the preliminary injunction. Macmillan, which rejected
each of Bass's overtures, said last week it would appeal the ruling
to the Delaware Supreme Court.
   In afternoon trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange,
Macmillan was up 75 cents to $78.87{ after jumping $4.12{ on
Friday. The stock was one of the 10 most actively traded issues on
the exchange.
   There has been considerable speculation Macmillan would seek a
``white knight,'' or friendly suitor to help it fend off Bass. The
fact that Macmillan's stock has risen beyond Bass's offering price
is a further indication Wall Street is looking for another bidder.
   In addition to its plans to keep Macmillan independent, Bass
said in the letter to directors that it wants to retain the
publisher's operating management because ``they have done an
excellent job working largely independently of the corporate
officers, albeit under their general direction.''
   The letter said Bass would design an ``incentive plan'' to
retain operating management. As far as corporate officers are
concerned, a Bass source noted that the group generally retains the
top brass.
   The letter said Bass would discuss a similar incentive plan with
key corporate executives.
   The Bass offer for all of Macmillan's outstanding shares it does
not already own is scheduled to expire at midnight EDT Aug. 12
unless extended. It is conditioned upon Macmillan refraining from
any restructuring plan.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unexpectedly heavy weekend rains in the
drought-stricken Midwest sent grain and soybean futures plummeting
to a sharply lower close Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans for July delivery skidded more than $1.17 a bushel, the
second-steepest one-day soybean price decline in the exchange's
history.
   July corn plunged 33{ cents a bushel. Prices on other corn and
soybean contracts fell their respective limits of 15 cents and 45
cents a bushel.
   ``I would describe this price plunge as a train wreck,'' said
Rich Feltes, director of commodities research for Refco Inc., a
large, Chicago-based trading firm. He called the rainy weekend
``the biggest weather shocker of the summer.''
   Rain also fell Monday in parts of the Farm Belt and more was
forecast for Tuesday. The cold front was expected to move eastward
out of the region on Wednesday but temperatures were expected to
remain markedly cooler than the 90- and 100-degree readings that
baked the Midwest last week.
   The rains should help soybean plants recover and halt the
deterioration of the corn crop, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 13 cents to 17{ cents lower with July at
$3.69 a bushel; corn was 15 cents to 33{ cents lower with July at
$3 a bushel; oats were 15 cents to 26{ cents lower with July at
$2.85 a bushel; soybeans were 45 cents to $1.17{ lower with July at
$8.77 a bushel.

<HEAD>Banking Companies Rebound From 1987 Second-Quarter Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Major banking companies reported Monday their second-quarter
earnings rebounded from heavy losses posted in the same period of
1987.
   Chase Manhattan Corp., J.P. Morgan & Co., Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. and Continental Illinois Corp. recorded sharp losses a year
ago after making hefty additions to their reserves to protect
against possibly uncollectable loans to underdeveoped nations.
   Chase Manhattan, the nation's second largest banking company,
said it had an after-tax profit of $224 million, or $2.45 a share,
in the second three months of 1988, compared with a loss of $1.4
billion a year earlier.
   The latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $69 million
from the sale of Chase's interest in Cain Chemical Inc. Chase said
it had relatively flat interest income during the quarter.
   Chase added $150 million to its loan-loss reserve during the
quarter, compared with the $1.73 billion increase that led to the
company's heavy loss in the same period of 1987.
   Morgan, the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and the nation's
fifth largest bank holding company, earned $228.7 million, or $1.23
a share, during April-June quarter, compared with a loss of $586.4
million in 1987.
   In the second quarter of last year, Morgan increased its
loan-loss reserve by $875 million; in the latest quarter, it set
aside $30 million.
   Morgan attributed the improvement in earnings to the reduction
in loan-loss provisions and to an increase in its non-interest
operating income. The company said it had lower interest income and
higher expenses during the quarter.
   Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's sixth largest banking
company, earned $403.1 million, or $7.93 per share, in the second
quarter, compared with a $1.37 billion loss a year earlier.
   The latest quarter's results include a $291.3 million after-tax
gain from the sale of the company's consumer finance subsidiary,
Manufacturers Hanover Consumer Services Inc.
   In the 1987 quarter, Manufacturers Hanover added $1.7 billion to
its loan-loss reserves, while in the latest quarter, it added
$132.8 million.
   Continental Illinois, the nation's 14th largest bank holding
company, earned $60.2 million, or 24 cents per share, in the second
quarter, compared with a loss of $476.9 million a year earlier.
   While Continental Illinois provided $510.1 million for loan-loss
reserves a year ago, it set aside $6.1 million in the most recent
quarter.
   The company attributed its earnings improvement to higher
revenue and lower expenses.
   For the first half of 1988, Chase Manhattan reported earnings of
$501 million, or $5.53 a share, 1988, compared with a loss of $1.3
billion last year.
   J.P. Morgan earned $510.1 million, or $2.75 a share, compared
with a $360 million loss in 1987.
   Manufacturers Hanover earned $534.4 million, or $10.52 per
share, compared with a loss of $1.29 billion a year ago.
   Continental Illinois earned $128.7 million, or 51 cents per
share, compared with a loss of $433.8 million in 1987.

   Citibank, the largest bank in the United States with $101.1
billion in deposits as of Dec. 31, ranked 28th in the trade paper's
survey of the 500 largest banks in the world. Citibank ranked 17th
last year.
   American Banker said that was the first time no U.S. bank was
represented among the top 25 since it began the annual survey 31
years ago.
   ``The falling dollar is obviously a reason why the Japanese and
Europe have more banks in the top 500,'' said Harvey Glassman, a
statistician with American Banker.
   Glassman said the yen appreciated 22.16 percent against the
dollar between Sept. 30, 1986, and March 31, 1988, while most other
major currencies also strengthened against the dollar.
   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Tokyo again ranked No. 1 on the
list, with deposits of $275.3 billion as of March 31, which was the
end of Japan's business year.
   In all, Japan had 17 banks among the top 25, while France had
four and West Germany and Britain had two each.
   Bank of America, the No. 2 U.S. bank, ranked 45th with $70.2
billion in deposits. Chase Manhattan, the third largest in this
country, ranked 51st with $53.7 billion in deposits.

   Stock prices slumped today amid renewed worries
over the outlook for interest rates.
   Analysts said many traders were concerned that continuing
strength in the economy would exert upward pressure on interest
rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, dropped as much as $10 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 9.25-9.35 percent
range.
   On the plus side, the optimists hope robust earnings reports for
the second quarter will serve as a support for stock prices over
the next few weeks.
   But while that worked in favor of some individual issues today,
it didn't do much for the overall market.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is demanding $557 million in
additional taxes, plus interest, from Atlantic Richfield Co. for
windfall profits on Alaskan oil, the company announced Monday.
   Arco said it would contest the tax assessment and was prepared
to go to court if the dispute can't be settled through negotiations
with the Internal Revenue Service.
   The cumulative interest on the tax claim could more than double
the amount the government is seeking, Arco said.
   The company said it also is subject to assessment of what it
termed ``a substantially lesser amount'' of additional taxes on
windfall profits on Alaskan North Slope crude oil in 1984 and 1985.
   ``Resolution of the proposed deficiency is not expected to have
a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial
position,'' the company said in a news release.
   Since 1980, Arco said, it has paid nearly $900 million in
windfall profit taxes for the 487 million barrels of crude oil it
has taken from the North Slope.
   The tax assessment was made in an IRS notice of proposed
deficiency, which isn't a final determination that taxes are due,
the company said.

<HEAD>Will Change in Teamster Leadership Affect Dispute With Pan Am?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The change in leadership of the Teamsters could
bring a softening of the union's hard line against Pan Am Corp.'s
attempt to get its unions to accept wage cuts, some observers said
Monday.
   But the head of the Teamsters local at Pan Am insisted there
would be no change of position.
   The local has been locked for months in a stalemate with the
financially pressed airline, which has imposed $35 million in pay
cuts on the Teamsters under federal labor rules.
   Leaders of the union _ which represents around 4,500 reservation
clerks, baggage handlers and other ground staff at Pan Am _ have
threatened to strike the carrier under the same rules, but so far
have not done so.
   Of the five unions at Pan Am, only the Teamsters and flight
attendants have not accepted pay cuts and other labor concessions
that management says are needed to get the airline back on its feet.
   The election Friday of William J. McCarthy as the new national
Teamsters president, replacing the late Jackie Presser, raised hope
at Pan Am that the union might soften its position, said Pan Am
sources, who agreed to discuss the situation only if not quoted by
name.
   But William Genoese, director of the Teamsters' airline
division, said his union's new leadership would not lessen its
resolve to battle Pan Am.
   McCarthy is ``feisty and he's going to fight (Pan Am)
tooth-and-nail,'' Genoese said. ``He's my kind of guy.''
   Some observers expect McCarthy _ who led a rump movement among
Teamster vice presidents against a new nationwide trucking contract
_ to shake up the nation's largest union. His election by the
Teamsters' General Executive Board came just two weeks after the
Justice Department filed suit to seize control of the union's
affairs, claiming its leadership has been controlled by organized
crime for more than 30 years.
   ``I think the entire Teamster organization is going to be
different with Mr. McCarthy as the head of it,'' said William A.
Krupman, a New York-based labor lawyer who advises management. ``I
think you're going to see a lot of changes.''
   Pan Am's biggest union, the Transport Workers, announced Friday
that it would join the pilots and flight engineers in agreeing to
labor concessions. In return for the union's agreement to freeze
wages, Pan Am withdrew its threat to sell a large portion of its
assets.
   The agreement with the Transport Workers, which also includes
work-rule concessions, would save the airline around $81 million
over the next three years, according to both the union and Pan Am.
It must still be ratified by the union membership.
   Last spring, the pilots and flight engineers agreed to pay cuts
and concessions totaling about $240 million over three years.
   The airline's management says it needs around $540 million in
labor cost savings over that period to turn itself around. In
addition to the $35 million in wage reductions imposed on the
Teamsters, Pan Am is seeking $90 million in pay cuts from its
flight attendants.
   Repeated phone calls seeking comment from representatives of the
flight attendants were not returned.

   Warner Communications Inc. said Monday that its
earnings rose 22.3 percent in the second quarter, boosted by record
profits in its film, music and cable broadcasting divisions.
   For the three-month period ended June 30, Warner's after-tax

million, or 68 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
Revenue rose 33.4 percent to $1.02 billion from $766 million.
   For the first half of 1988, Warner had a net profit of $216.7
million, or $1.36 per share, on revenues of $1.98 billion. That
compared with earnings of $169.9 million, or $1.09 per share, on
sales of $1.55 billion in the first half of 1987.
   ``Warner Communications Inc. achieved a strong earnings gain for
the second quarter and first six months, as our filmed
entertainment, recorded music and cable broadcasting divisions all
reported the best second quarter and first half results in their

<TEXT>
   The chairman of MGM-UA
Communications Co. resigned Monday, a week after controlling
sharholder Kirk Kerkorian announced he would split the movie and TV
company into two.
   Lee Rich will be replaced as chairman and chief executive by
Stephen D. Silbert, current president and chief operating officer,
the company announced.
   No reason was given for Rich's departure.
   On July 11, the company said MGM, the former
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, would be spun off from MGM-UA into a separate,
publicly held company with Kerkorian as a major shareholder. MGM-UA
is a combination of the movie company known for its roaring lion
logo and United Artists.
   The split, which includes purchase of 25 percent of stock in the
new MGM by a company controlled by Beverly Hills investor Burt
Sugarman and movie producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, is to
close in the fall.
   It calls for sale of $400 million in stock in the new MGM to
present MGM-UA shareholders, including Kerkorian, with $100 million
of the proceeds going to MGM and the rest to United Artists.
   ``Lee Rich was instrumental in the re-establishment of this
company as a major force in the entertainment industry,'' Silbert
said in a news release. ``We wish him well in his future
endeavors.''

<HEAD>Apple Computer Earnings Increase 71 Percent; NCR, Lotus Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Quarterly profits rose 71 percent at Apple Computer Inc., 14
percent at NCR Corp. and 6 percent at Lotus Development Corp., the
companies reported Monday.
   Apple's strong results impressed financial analysts, who pointed
to strong sales of the Macintosh II and quarterly revenue near the
billion-dollar mark.
   ``A few years ago, people said Apple couldn't make it in the
business market,'' because of International Business Machines
Corp., said Eugene G. Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York. ``But Apple has gained the momentum necessary to achieve
critical mass in that market.
   ``They've arrived and it will take quite an effort on the part
of any competitor to dislodge them,'' he said. ``IBM will try, but
even IBM will have trouble.''
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said net income in its third
fiscal quarter rose to $91.3 million, or 71 cents a share, from
$53.5 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the
quarter rose 56 percent to $993.1 million, up from $637.1 million
in the same period a year ago.
   Net income for the nine months was $292.3 million, or $2.24 per
share, double the earnings of $145.8 million, or $1.11 per share,
recorded in the comparable period a year ago. Sales for the nine
months ending July 1 were $2.9 billion, a 55 percent increase over
sales of $1.9 billion a year ago.
   ``These results demonstrate the success we are having in our
markets around the world,'' said Delbert W. Yocam, Apple's chief
operating officer. ``We continue to make good progress in business
markets with our Macintosh personal computers.''
   NCR, a computer company based in Dayton, Ohio, said it earned
$112.4 million, a record for a second quarter, up from $98.6
million a year earlier. Earnings per share, boosted by a share
repurchase program, jumped 30 percent to $1.36 from $1.05. Revenue
rose 10 percent, to $1.5 billion from $1.36 billion a year earlier.
   In the first half of the year, NCR earned $186.6 million, or
$2.23 a share, up from $160.1 million, or $1.69 a share, in the
first six months of 1987. Revenue expanded to $2.78 billion from
$2.48 billion.
   Lotus, based in Cambridge, Mass., said its second-quarter profit
was boosted by sales of Symphony, its best-selling integrated
software package, and of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet software. Earnings
rose to $17.3 million, or 38 cents a share, from $16.3 million, or
36 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   Second-quarter revenue jumped 30 percent, to $122.1 million from
$94 million a year earlier.
   In the first half of the year, Lotus earned $35.6 million, or 77
cents a share, up from $30 million, or 66 cents a share, in the
first six months of 1987. Revenue increased to $239.4 million from
$178.8 million.

   The drought is blasting sales through
the roof for Tennessee well drillers, who are hiring extra help and
extending hours to meet the demand, officials said Monday.
   Many of the additional customers are farmers who need irrigation
wells drilled deeper, and others are home-owners afraid
drought-inspired water restrictions will leave their pools, ponds,
lawns and gardens high and dry.
   ``I'd say water well sales have probably increased tenfold since
two years ago, which is pretty significant,'' said Gil Jackson,
owner of Jackson Enterprises Inc. in Lebanon. ``People are scared.
We try to put the farmer who needs to water his stock before the
person who wants to fill his swimming pool.''
   Jackson's company has drilled an average eight new wells per
week since this year's dry spring. Before that, the company was
lucky to get two or three requests for new wells each month, he
said.
   Officials of other companies throughout the state reported
similar increases. The extra business means some customers have to
wait up to four weeks, said Kenneth Casey, co-owner of Casey's Well
Drilling Inc. in Jonesborough.
   Max Campbell, owner of Campbell Well Drilling Inc. in McKenzie,
said he hired three extra people and is keeping the business open
seven days a week. Jackson said he's hired four extra workers.
   ``We're busy. There's no doubt the drought has had a whole lot
to do with it,'' Campbell said. ``We've had a lot of calls from
Arkansas and Missouri. The drillers there have just gotten behind
and the farmers there can't get their irrigation wells drilled fast
enough.''
   George Eatherly, owner of George Eatherly Drilling Co. in
Lebanon, said his business has doubled in the last two months.
   ``People's wells are going dry. The cities don't want them on
city water,'' he said.
   Jackson said the industry was lackluster before the drought.
   ``For all practical purposes, the business had died. It was an
industry that wasn't needed anymore because the city water systems
had been extensively developed in our area,'' he said. ``Now with
water restrictions, people in the cities are beginning to want
wells drilled again where people have had city water for 20 years.
   ``They want water to water their lawns and fill their swimming
pools. It's a different demand.''

<HEAD>Government To Help Finance Giant Oil Project Off Newfoundland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gambling that oil prices will rise, the Canadian
government signed a landmark agreement with five oil companies
Monday for the $7 billion development of the Hibernia oil field off
Newfoundland.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney flew to St. John's, Newfoundland,
to announce that the federal government will contribute $830
million in grants and up to $1.3 billion in loan guarantees for the
giant project.
   ``This is a day for rejoicing for the people of Newfoundland and
Labrador and an important day for all Canadians,'' Mulroney said.
``Hibernia is by far and away the largest capital investment in the
history of Atlantic Canada.''
   He said the project could break the cycle of federal dependency
in Canada's poorest province. ``It means bringing quality jobs into
Newfoundland rather than people moving away from home in search of
work,'' he said.
   But the Conservative prime minister, who is getting ready to
call a general election to seek a second term, acknowledged that
Hibernia is a gamble. World oil prices now hovering around $15 a
barrel need to pass the $20 mark to make the project pay.
   ``If certainty of results and the elimination of risks had been
required in advance, (Canada's first prime minister) Sir John A.
Macdonald would never have proceeded with the great endeavors which
bound Canada together,'' Mulroney said.
   While his faith in the project may win votes in the maritime
provinces of the East, Mulroney may face questions in other regions
of the country over such a massive expenditure.
   Hibernia was discovered in the North Atlantic 185 miles east of
St. John's in 1979. Falling oil prices and years of arguing between
the federal and provincial governments over offshore rights led to
repeated delays. The political fight was settled in 1985 when
Newfoundland won the right to offshore royalties.
   It will still be six years before construction is completed, and
the project will then have about 20 years of productive life.
   The consortium developing the field is led by Mobil Oil Canada
Ltd. of Calgary and includes Gulf Canada, Petro-Canada, Chevron
Canada Resources Ltd. and Columbia Gas System of Delaware.
   The companies demanded concessions from the federal and
provincial governments before signing the agreement, because it
would now cost more to get the oil out of the Atlantic than
refineries would receive for it.
   Hibernia will create 1,100 permanent jobs over its 20 years of
production, and about 1,400 jobs during the construction phase.
   Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said it will start an
economic revival that will give island natives a choice other than
poverty or emigration.
   The province has an unemployment rate of 17 percent, the highest
in Canada, and its economy is over-dependent on dwindling fish
stocks around its coast.
   As part of the deal, construction of the Hibernia drilling
platform will be done entirely in Come-by-Chance, Newfoundland.
   The province will waive its 12-percent sales tax on building
materials during the construction phase and reduce it to 4 percent
once Hibernia enters production. Payment of its 16-percent
corporate income tax is open to further negotiation.
   The federal government will get 10 percent of net revenues and
estimates a return of $1.9 billion to $3.9 billion over two decades
through taxes and royalties.
   Newfoundland, a co-signer of the agreement, will phase in
royalties starting at 1 percent and projects revenues of $2.1
billion to $4.2 billion.
   Hibernia is estimated to contain at least 525 million barrels of
oil and should produce an average 110,000 barrels a day during peak
production, about 7 percent of Canada's projected demand by the end
of the century.
   Large-scale development in the western provinces made Canada
self-sufficient in oil and natural gas but land-based reserves are
running low, causing companies to look at offshore reserves in the
Atlantic and Arctic as well as the tar sands of Alberta.

<HEAD>Rain Sends Grain Prices Plummeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Unexpectedly heavy weekend rains in the drought-stricken Midwest
sent grain and soybean futures plummeting Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade and analysts predicted prices would again fall their
allowable limits on Tuesday.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were broadly mixed
in reaction to the plunging grain prices; sugar prices fell; energy
futures soared; precious metals advanced; and stock-index futures
retreated.
   The weekend showers in the Farm Belt should help stressed
soybean plants recover and halt the deterioration of the corn crop,
which is nearing the end of its critical pollination phase,
analysts said.
   Soybeans for July delivery skidded more than $1.09 a bushel, one
of the steepest one-day soybean price declines in the exchange's
history. July corn plunged 30 cents a bushel. Prices for other corn
and soybean contracts fell their respective limits of 15 cents and
45 cents a bushel.
   Rich Feltes, director of commodities research for Refco Inc., a
large, Chicago-based trading firm, called the price plunge ``a
train wreck'' and ``the biggest weather shocker of the summer.''
   Rain also fell Monday in parts of the Farm Belt and more was
forecast for Tuesday. Temperatures in the wake of the cold front
were expected to remain below the 90- and 100-degree readings that
baked the Midwest last week.
   ``I think people are sensing the (drought) pattern may be
breaking up,'' Feltes said. ``No one knows for certain, but we've
bought some important time for the 50 percent of the corn crop that
has not yet pollinated and certainly for the soybeans, which could
approach yields that are above what the market's been trading.''
   The National Weather Service issued a 6-to-10-day outlook after
the markets closed, calling for above-normal temperatures and
normal to below-normal rainfall in the Midwest during the first
five days of next week.
   Soybeans will enter their most critical growing stage next week
when the pods now forming on the plants begin filling with beans,
analysts said.
   The soybean market has generally been more sensitive to weather
changes this season than the grains because the relatively small
stockpile of soybeans raises the threat of a shortage if yields are
substantially reduced.
   Wheat settled 13 cents to 19{ cents lower with July at $3.69 a
bushel; corn was 15 cents to 30 cents lower with July at $3.03{ a
bushel; oats were 15 cents to 24{ cents lower with July at $2.87 a
bushel; soybeans were 45 cents to $1.09{ lower with July at $8.85 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures finished widely mixed and pork futures were
sharply lower, all in reaction to the falling grain prices,
analysts said.
   As grain prices rose during the past three months, livestock
traders sold contracts for summer and fall deliveries while bidding
up prices for 1989 deliveries on the theory that rising feed costs
would force livestock producers to sell more animals, thereby
reducing the size of their breeding herds.
   With the sudden drop in grain prices, traders took the opposite
tack.
   Live cattle settled 1.48 cents lower to .93 cent higher with
August at 65.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent to the
limit 1.50 cents higher with August at 76.25 cents a pound; hogs
were .05 cent to the limit 1.50 cents lower with July at 46.17
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .75 cent to the limit 2
cents lower with July at 36.55 cents a pound.
   Sugar futures prices dropped sharply in sympathy with soybeans.
Sugar for October delivery on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange settled .62 cent lower at 14.61 cents a pound.
   Some energy futures soared their limits on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in response to news that Iran would accept a
U.N. resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire to its nearly
8-year-old war with Iraq. Iraq already has accepted the resolution.
   Peace between the Persian Gulf countries could increase the
chances for a united OPEC effort to reduce crude oil production,
analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 60 cents to 92 cents
higher with August at $15.70 a barrel; heating oil was 1.95 cents
to 2.15 cents higher with August at 43.27 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.38 cents to 2 cents higher with August at 51.11
cents a gallon.
   Precious metals prices fell on New York's Commodity Exchange in
response to the falling grain prices, the stronger dollar and
rising interest rates, analysts said.
   Gold settled $2.40 to $2.50 lower with August at $438.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 16 cents to 16.5 cents lower with July at $7.15 a
troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 index settled .50 point lower
at 272.30.

   Gold prices also fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
bullion at $437.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $440
Friday.
   Currency brokers said the central banks of the United States,
West Germany and Britain intervened actively in the foreign
exchange markets, selling dollars to deflate the currency's rising
value.
   Some said the Federal Reserve sold dollars at least three times
during the day. The Fed and other central banks do not comment on
their intervention activities.
   ``Even as the dollar was coming down, they would sell more
dollars,'' said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief foreign exchange dealer at
the Banco di Sicilia's New York branch.
   ``I think it's not so much to stop the dollar from going higher
as to slow the rise,'' Glamuzina said. ``They just don't want the
speculation to get out of hand.''
   The central bank action came against a background of growing
attraction for the dollar, which has risen to the highest levels
since early last year.
   A higher dollar attracts more foreign capital to the United
States and raises demand for domestic stocks and bonds. But some
U.S. economists fear that a rapidly appreciating dollar could
reverse the nation's slowly improving balance of trade by making
American exports more expensive and imports cheaper.
   Traders said Iran's unconditional agreement to a U.N. cease-fire
proposal in its eight-year-old war with Iraq also weakened the
dollar, which historically has been a safe-haven currency during
times of unrest.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.75 yen to a closing 135.15 yen. But
later in London it was quoted lower at 134.75 yen. By the time
trading ended in New York the dollar traded at 134.51 yen, down
from 135.45 yen Friday.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.6693, vs. $1.6635 late
Friday. In New York the pound fetched $1.6745, up from $1.6605
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York vs. late Friday: 1.8749 West
German marks, down from 1.8815; 1.5565 Swiss francs, down from
1.5588; 1.2065 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2101; 6.3445 French
francs, up from 6.3385; and 1,388.00 Italian lire, down from
1,391.63.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe vs. late Friday: 1.8823 marks,
up from 1.8780; 1.5625 Swiss francs, up from 1.5555; 6.3415 French
francs, up from 6.3285; 2.1130 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1150;
1,390.50 Italian lire, up from 1,387.25; 1.2095 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2117.
   The price of gold, which like the dollar often is considered a
safe-haven investment during politically tense periods, fell on the
Persian Gulf news.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
fell $2.40 a troy ounce to $437.80. Earlier in London gold fell to
$436.25 from $438.40 late Friday; in Zurich the price was $435 down
from $439, and in Hong Kong it was $440, down from $441.86.
   Silver was quoted in London at $7.13 a troy ounce, down from
$7.30 Friday. On the New York Comex silver fell 16 cents to $7.15.

   Stock prices lapsed into a sluggish decline
Monday amid new worries about inflation and the outlook for
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 23.30
points last week, dropped 11.56 to 2,117.89.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
542 up, 944 down and 489 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 156.21 million
shares, down from 199.71 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 177.75 million shares.
   Analysts said many traders were concerned that continuing
strength in the economy would exert upward pressure on interest
rates.
   Inflation worries flared up again as oil prices jumped on word
that Iran had acceded to a United Nations resolution calling for a
cease-fire in its war against Iraq.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, dropped nearly $10 for each $1,000
in face value, putting their yields in the 9.25-9.35 percent range.
   On the plus side, optimists on Wall Street hope that robust
earnings reports for the second quarter will serve as a support for
stock prices over the next few weeks.
   But while that worked in favor of some individual issues Monday,
it didn't do much for the market as a whole.
   MCI Communications, the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market, rose 1\ to 17]. The company reported that
its second-quarter earnings increased to 25 cents a share from 3
cents in the comparable period last year.
   Apple Computer, another prominent OTC stock, gained { to 45{ on
higher quarterly profits.
   Among Big Board-listed issues, Union Carbide, up ~ at 25\, and
United Technologies, up | at 38[, both were helped by higher
earnings.
   Energy stocks generally showed fractional gains on the oil-price
news, while airlines were mostly lower.
   Losers among the blue chips included McDonald's, down 1] at 45[;
Alcoa, down ] at 54\; General Electric, down } at 43, and
International Business Machines, down ] at 125[.
   Macmillan Inc. rose ~ to 79. As the Robert M. Bass Group began a
$75-a-share tender offer for the company, speculation on Wall
Street about possible further bids drove the stock higher.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $14.04 billion, or 0.52
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .82 to 152.83.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.68 to 312.70, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.54 at 270.51.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .18 to 394.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 309.08, down .23.

<TEXT>
   Florida Steel Corp. said Monday that an
investor group led by its senior management has proposed acquiring
the company for cash and stock that values the company at about
$280 million.
   Florida Steel said no decision has been made to sell but a
special committee of independent directors is reviewing the
proposal.
   Under the proposed acquisition, about 85 percent of the
company's shares would be bought for $47 per share in cash and and
15 percent would be exchanged for preferred stock.
   The company had about 6.05 million shares of common stock
outstanding as of Dec. 31.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Florida Steel closed
unchanged at $48 a share on Monday.
   The investor group, which includes Edward L. Flom, chairman and
chief executive, has obtained written commitments for the financing
necessary to complete the transaction, according to the proposal.
   The offer is conditioned on the negotiation and execution of a
definitive merger agreement, receipt of financing and board
approval as well as other customary conditions, Florida Steel said.
   Florida Steel produces, manufactures, fabricates and sells steel
products mainly for use in construction and industrial markets.

<HEAD>Brazil Seeks Bridge Loan to Pay Foreign Debt Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil will pay the back interest due on
its huge foreign debt if it gets a $500 million short-term ``bridge
loan'' from foreign government treasuries, the finance ministry
said Monday.
   Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega is in Europe negotiating the
loan with Western official creditors, and an announcement was
expected by week's end, ministry spokesman Geraldo Moura told The
Associated Press.
   If Brazil gets the loan, the government will use its
hard-currency reserves to complete the interest due for June and
July, Moura said. He said the total due was ``about $1 billion.''
   Brazil's foreign debt is put at $121 billion, the largest in the
developing world.
   The financial press here said the payments could include August
interest and total $1.8 billion, but Moura said talks only involved
arrears for June and July.
   Nobrega, in a speech to the Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in
London, said Brazil was close to lining up a $500 million
short-term loan from the Bank of International Settlements to tide
the nation over until an International Monetary Fund loan is made
later this year.
   Nobrega left London late Monday for Paris, where he was to meet
with French bankers before journeying to Rome and Frankfurt.
   ``There is no use denying the difficulties the Brazilian economy
is facing now,'' Nobrega said in his speech. ``But I can assure you
the government is trying to correct the imbalances of the economy
and to normalize the relations with Brazilian creditors.''
   Brazil's currency reserves are a closely guarded secret. In
March they were calculated at some $3.9 billion but are believed to
be higher now, bolstered by healthy trade surpluses averaging more
than $1.8 billion a month.
   Brazil has not fully paid all the interest it owes for 1987, but
those arrears are dealt with in a $62 billion rescheduling package
that Nobrega is touring world financial centers to promote.
   In June, Brazil reached an agreement with private foreign
creditors for $5.2 billion in loans this year and in 1989. The
government is to pay back the money in 12 years, with a five-year
grace period.
   Brazil also agreed to repay $1.7 billion of the principal, or
actual amount owed, in three installments between 1991 and 1993.
   About $70 billion of the total debt is owed to hundreds of
foreign private banks. In early 1987 Brazil stopped paying interest
on that part of the debt, but lifted the moratorium at the end of
the year.

   Burlington Northern Inc. on Monday reported a
second quarter loss of $41 million, reflecting a previously
announced special charge of $230 million.
   The loss for the second quarter contrasted with a profit of $82
million, or $1.09 per share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 7 percent to $1.68 billion from
$1.57 billion a year earlier.
   The $230 million special charge represents the company's
estimate of the costs it may have to absorb to settle all of its
take-or-pay related claims, including those in litigation.
   Take-or-pay is a contractual term used when acquiring natural
gas. A company either agrees to pay for gas before acquiring it or
the company can take the gas now and pay the producer later.
   For the first six months of the year, the railroad and resources
company said its earnings fell sharply to $56.5 million, or 74
cents a share, from $159.8 million, or $2.13 a share, a year
earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose to $3.55 billion from $3.22 billion a
year earlier.

   MGM-UA Communications Co. Chairman
Lee Rich resigned Monday, a week after controlling shareholder Kirk
Kerkorian announced he would split the movie and television company
in two.
   Rich, who made his name in Hollywood as co-founder of the
company that makes TV's ``Dallas,'' was replaced as chairman and
chief executive by Stephen D. Silbert, a Kerkorian confidant, the
company announced.
   MGM-UA officials wouldn't discuss Rich's plans, and he didn't
immediately respond to a telephone request for comment.
   Silbert, 45, a lawyer and adviser to Las Vegas, Nev., investor
Kerkorian, had been president and chief operating officer since
October 1986. Silbert said Rich's departure wasn't the result of
plans to split MGM-UA into its original parts, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
and United Artists.
   ``It's absolutely unrelated,'' Silbert said of Rich's
resignation. ``We've known about it for some time.''
   Rich, who is in his late 60s, took the helm of United Artists
Corp. in April 1986, hours after resigning from Lorimar
Productions, which he helped found 17 years before.
   With co-founder Merv Adelson, the bluntly-spoken former ad man
built Lorimar into a television powerhouse, in part on the success
of ``Dallas,'' TV's first prime-time soap opera, and its spinoffs.
   Rich left Lorimar six months after the company agreed to the
merger that formed the present Lorimar Telepictures Corp.
   Rich's resignation from MGM-UA came exactly one week after the
company announced that MGM, the former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, would
be spun off from MGM-UA into a separate, publicly held company with
Kerkorian as a major shareholder. The split is scheduled to be
completed in the fall.
   Rich joined United Artists as chairman and chief executive in
the midst of a complicated series of transactions in which
Kerkorian broke MGM-UA into its components, sold off MGM's
3,000-title film library and production lot, then rejoined the
companies.
   The latest transaction will divide the companies again, but
leave Kerkorian a majority shareholder in United Artists and 40
percent owner of MGM. The new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United
Artists also will share the film distribution system of the present
MGM-UA.
   MGM takes with it the roaring lion logo, a movie and TV
production system, and a small library of movies made since 1986,
including the Oscar-winning ``Moonstruck.''
   United Artists will be a movie and TV production company with a
950-title movie library, including the ``Rocky'' and ``Pink
Panther'' movies.

<HEAD>Ford Announces Recall of Nearly 28,000 Continentals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. is recalling 27,757 1988
Lincoln Continentals to correct wiring and gear shift problems, and
about 16,000 1986-87 trucks to check emissions levels, the
automaker said Monday.
   Three fires were reported but no injuries or accidents were
attributed to the wiring problems in the Continentals, Ford
spokesman Chuck Snearly said. Owners will be notified by mail and
alterations will be made at the company's expense, Ford said.
   Dealers will correct one of the wiring problems by installing
heat resistant Fiberglas tape around a wiring harness located in
the engine compartment.
   The tape must be installed to insulate a nylon shield that
covers the harness, which could melt, drip onto the exhaust
manifold and cause an engine fire, John P. King, parts and service
engineering office manager, said in a statement.
   Most of the cars also will have a new ignition switch and
certain ignition circuit electrical wiring and connectors
installed, Ford said. The ignition switch wiring in the cars can
lose electrical contact under heavy use, according to the automaker.
   Loss of electrical contact could cause turn signals, the radio
and the heater and air conditioner to malfunction, King said. It
also could affect braking.
   Transmission gear shift cables also will be replaced in most of
the Continentals to prevent the cables from breaking and resulting
in a false gear reading on the instrument panel.
   Ford also said it plans to voluntarily recall about 16,000
1986-87 F-Series and B-Series and 1986 C-Series trucks with gross
vehicle weight ratings of 14,000 or higher to assure acceptable
evaporative emissions levels. The affected trucks are equipped with
6.1-liter, four-barrel carburetor and 7.0-liter, four-barrel
carburetor engines.

   A reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co. moved
close to confirmation Monday, but the federal judge overseeing the
case said the plan must include a provision giving the court
authority to oversee a trust fund for Dalkon Shield claimants.
   The plan would set up a nearly $2.5 billion trust fund to
satisfy claims by women who allege they were injured by using the
Dalkon Shield intruterine birth-control device and provides for a
$3.2 billion buyout of the 122-year-old company by the American
Home Products Corp.
   ``I certainly want to confirm this plan,'' U.S. District Judge
Robert R. Merhige said.
   But he said he and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Blackwell N. Shelley,
who are supervising Robins' bankruptcy reorganization, cannot
confirm the plan without a provision ensuring court protection of
the $2.5 billion fund.
   Merhige gave attorneys a week to submit briefs on the proposed
revision.
   Lawyers for Robins indicated they would accept the modification,
but Mark Ellenberg, a lawyer for the Dalkon Shield Claimants
Committee, said he was concerned that such a provision would create
new and troubling legal obligations.
   Earlier in the hearing, lawyers for Robins said an overwhelming
percentage of stockholders and Dalkon Shield claimants have
approved the reorganization plan which could end the company's
nearly three-year bankruptcy proceedings.
   Dennis Drebsky, an attorney for the pharmaceutical company, said
about 95 percent of the 141,094 Dalkon Shield claimants who sent in
ballots voted in favor of the plan.
   He said more than 99 percent of the 19 million Robins common
stockholders who voted backed the plan, as were all other classes
of creditors.
   The New York-based American Home Products also would pay Robins'
creditors in full.
   Drebsky and Murray Drabkin, who represents the Dalkon Shield
Claimants Committee that speaks for claimants in the case, urged
approval of the plan during a federal court hearing.
   Drabkin said the plan ``provides a just and fair resolution of
the case.''
   While it is not an ideal solution, Drabkin said it meets the
claimants' requirements for the possibility of independent claims
resolutions and the certainty of money being available for awards.
   But another lawyer representing several hundred Dalkon Shield
claimants said the trust fund would be inadequate. Attorney Ralph
Pittle also said more claimants would have voted against the plan
if they had been better informed. Ballots were mailed to creditors
in April and had to be returned by July 11.
   Pittle said the plan was difficult for claimants to understand,
especially since many of them do not have lawyers.
   Testimony by Robins' witnesses focused on the company's decision
to merge with American Home Products rather than to liquidate
Robins' assets. Pittle challenged the company's accounting,
suggesting that more money would have been available for claimants
if the company had been sold.
   If Merhige and Shelley approve the plan, parties will have 30
days to appeal before a final confirmation order is issued.
Payments to claimants from a $100 million cash fund set up by
Robins will begin 30 days after Merhige's approval, regardless of
whether any appeals are filed.
   Lawyers for Robins also revealed Monday that the company will
pay $27 million plus interest to satisfy Internal Revenue Service
claims. The IRS had sought $62 million in disputed back taxes from
the company, unrelated to the bankruptcy proceedings.
   Robins filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1985
after paying about $530 million to settle 9,500 of 15,000 lawsuits
stemming from its sale of the IUD, about 4.5 million of which were
distributed in this country and abroad in the early 1970s.
   The reorganization plan calls for the claimants to receive
payments from Robins, American Home Products and Aetna Casualty and
Surety Co., which carried liability insurance on the Dalkon Shield.

   Union Carbide Corp. on Monday reported
that its second-quarter profit more than doubled over the same

segments _ chemicals and plastics, industrial gases and carbon
products _ reported sales increases.
   For the first six months, Union Carbide more than doubled its
profit to $288 million, or $2.14 per share, from $135 million, or
$1.03 per share, in the first half of 1987. Per-share earnings rose
to $2.14 from $1.03 in the first six months of 1987.
   Sales for the first six months increased 22 percent to $4.08
billion from $3.34 billion in the first half of 1987.

<HEAD>Ford Strategy Focuses on International, High-Quality Long-Term
Suppliers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Ford Motor Co. moves toward becoming one
global company, it is selecting suppliers who can serve it
worldwide, giving them long-term contracts and phasing out others,
Ford's purchasing director said Monday.
   But Steven Roberts said the move to a single international
corporation from a conglomeration of regional ones did not mean
that traditional North American suppliers would be shut out in
favor of European or Asian suppliers.
   He said major suppliers in the United States already operate in
Europe and Asia as well. Unlike General Motors Corp. and, to a
lesser extent, Chrysler Corp., Ford does not intend to move much of
its internal parts-making work to outside suppliers or drastically
reduce the number of outside suppliers it uses, Roberts said.
   But Ford has decided to stop doing business with suppliers who
it judges unworthy of its Q1 quality award by 1990. Ford began
using the Q1 system to rate suppliers in the United States in 1981
and in Europe in 1987.
   Most suppliers with international operations who have received
the award have been awarded long-term contracts, usually in the
five-year range, and similar contracts are being negotiated with
suppliers Ford believes will be eligible for the award in six
months, Roberts said.
   By 1990, all Ford suppliers will have long-term contracts and
the short-term contracts of those who do not meet Ford standards
should have expired, he said.
   About 50 percent of the parts money Ford spends already goes to
Q1 suppliers through long-term contracts, Roberts said. The
complete conversion by 1990 will shrink Ford's supplier base
somewhat, he added.
   In North America, Ford has used suppliers in 2,100 locations
since the mid-1980s, after shrinking its base from 3,500 supplier
locations in 1980.
   The changes in Ford's supplier strategy are part of its
evolution into a global company in which all responsibility for
individual products or a group of parts will be assigned to a
particular Ford operation that will serve the entire company,
eliminating duplication from country to country.
   Ford spends about 60 percent of its revenue on parts and
supplies that go into making cars. About 55 percent of its supply
spending goes to its 200 largest suppliers.
   Automakers worldwide are moving toward closer relationships with
suppliers, bringing them in as soon as a new product is conceived
and requiring them to shoulder a larger part of capital costs,
engineering, design and inventory management.

   Italy's Fiat Auto SpA has decided not to re-enter

Monday.
   Alfa Romeo is introducing its first new car since Fiat acquired
the luxury-sports car maker a year ago.
   Vittorio Ghidella said Fiat expects to sell 10,000 of the new
Alfa model, the 164, during its first year on the U.S. market as a
1990 model and will aim to sell 40,000 to 50,000 of the expensive
sports cars here eventually.
   The new 164 will cost less than $50,000, Ghidella said,
declining to give more specific details.
   Fiat will follow the 164 with the next Alfa Romeo Spyder
two-seater when it is introduced, he said.
   Ghidella said he decided to pull the Fiat line out of the United
States several years ago because of the strength of Japanese
competition in the small-car arena. He has no plans to export any
Fiat or Lancia cars to this country.
   Japanese imports are limited in Europe and Ghidella said he
hopes the execution of the European common market agreement in
1992, which will elimiante trade barriers between 12 European
nations, will continue limits on Japanese imports to Europe
regardless of whether the cars are built in Japan or the United
States.
   Ghidella said that despite the practice in the United States of
differentiating cars by their nation of manufacture, he believes
cars should be distinguished for trade purposes by the national
origin of each automaker.
   He also said he preferred that his company export its cars to
other nations rather than set up far-flung assembly plants, except
in nations that forbid the imports.
   Fiat retreated from the United States partly because of its
reputation as a poor-quality car. Ghidella said Fiat wants to
strengthen Alfa Romeo's image and sales in the United States to
help repair the image of the parent company and to give it some of
the panache of its new subsidiary.
   The Fiat line holds 62 percent of the car market in Italy and
15.8 percent of the total European market. Ninety percent of
Fiat-line sales are concentrated in Europe.
   Ghidella also is chairman of Ferrari and of Alfa Romeo-Lancia,
all owned by the Fiat parent company. He was Detroit to address the
five-day Automotive News World Congress, a gathering of auto
industry executives, analysts and suppliers.
