   Marxist rebels of the Western Sahara said
Sunday they shot down a U.S. locust-spraying plane in the belief it
was a Moroccan military aircraft, and they expressed their regrets.
   All five American crewmen aboard the plane were killed on
Thursday when a ground-to-air missile hit the DC-7 and it crashed
into the Western Sahara, a disputed territory south of Morocco. A
second DC-7 chartered by the U.S. Agency for International
Development also was hit, but it managed to land safely about 400
miles away.
   Rebel fighters of the Polisario front, who are fighting Morocco
for independence of the Western Sahara, thought the DC-7s were
Moroccan C-130 military planes, Polisario said in a telex from
Algiers to The Associated Press in New York.
   ``The destruction of one of the two crafts was in no way
premeditated. It was an error caused by a pure coincidence stemming
from the war conditions existing in the area and the moment that the
planes arrived,'' the statement said.
   Polisario said it found the wreckage of the plane and was
beginning to retrieve the bodies of the victims. It said the bodies
would be returned to their families.
   The rebel group's headquarters in Algiers earlier denied that its
units were involved in the attack.
   Sunday's statement called the incident tragic and expressed
Polisario's ``deepest regrets'' to the world and ``deepest sorrow''
to the United States. It said the rebels were convinced the incident
would not hurt their ``friendly and trusting'' relations with the
United States.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Rudy Boone said there
would be no immediate comment. He said U.S. officials would study
the statement.
   The rebel group said the unit that shot the missiles was carrying
no equipment that would have enabled it to identify the planes.
   It said the plane was attacked about 15 miles from a wall that
Morocco built in the Western Sahara to keep rebels from penetrating
farther north into Morocco.
   ``It should be noted that the reconnaissance patrols along the
wall come under daily attack from Moroccan aircraft,'' the statement
said.
   It said the planes were flying at the extremely low altitude of
6,000 feet. The U.S. Embassy in Rabat said shortly after the
accident that the planes were attacked at about 10,000 feet.
   In Rabat, Morocco, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said Saturday that
the Moroccan government pledged military protection to help a U.S.
team cross the rebel-held land to find the wreckage in the remote
region of the Sahara desert.
   The planes, which took off from Senegal and were bound for
Morocco, were on locust-spraying missions. None of the five
crewmembers in the second plane was injured.
   The pilot of the second plane, Joseph Francis Le Gros, told a
news conference in Agadir, Morocco, that he saw a missile hit the
first plane in an engine, which caught fire. The wing then fell off,
and the plane exploded before touching the ground, he said.
   Officials have said the plane crashed about 35 miles southeast of
the town of Smara in the Western Sahara. The spot lies halfway
between the Mauritanian border and the Moroccan defense wall.
   The rebels said in their statement Sunday that the patrol that
shot down the plane was also in the Smara region of the Western
Sahara at the time. The Moroccan government has maintained the
planes were shot at from neighboring Mauritania.
   The U.S. plane was the fifth aircraft shot down over the disputed
territory since the Sahara war broke out in 1975. Previous incidents
involved small French private aircraft.
   The Polisario movement seeks independence of the former Spanish
Sahara territory, annexed by Morocco in 1976 after Spain withdrew.
   The United Nations is holding talks in an effort to organize an
independence referendum of the estimated 100,000 inhabitants. But
the Polisario says Morocco should first withdraw.
   The FBI in Washington launched a criminal investigation Friday
into the missile attack. It is looking for possible violations of
U.S. law, such as one that deals with destruction of U.S. aircraft
overseas.

<HEAD>Record $1.1 Million Paid for Carousel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Minnesotans offered $1.1 million
Saturday for their State Fair carousel, just in time to save the
74-year-old, hand-carved wooden horses from being separated on the
auction block, officials said.
   The offer by Our Fair Carousel Inc. of St. Paul was a record sale
price for a carousel, said Guernsey's auction house spokeswoman
Barbara Mintz.
   The carousel's owners, the Blinstrup family of Eden Prairie,
Minn., set a $1.089 million floor price, meaning that if bids
totaled less than that, the carousel would not have been sold.
   Arlan Ettinger, the president of the auction house, said the deal
that apparently will keep the carousel at the Minnesota State Fair
was made just minutes before it was to go on the auction block.
   If the group's bid had been turned down, and if no one else had
bought the carousel whole, it would have been sold piece by piece,
probably fetching a higher price, Ettinger said.
   ``The family truly wanted it to stay there,'' Ettinger said.
``They urged us to consider selling it before the auction, which is
what we did.''
   ``Obviously, we're very excited; we're very happy,'' said Brian
Walton, a spokesman for Our Fair Carousel. ``We have saved the
carousel from the auction block, but we have a year to save the
carousel itself.''
   The non-profit group, formed just last month, has a year to raise
money to pay back the loan it took out to buy the carousel.
   The intricately carved carousel, created in 1914 by the
Philadelphia Toboggan Co., contains 68 wooden beasts. It was ridden
just 12 days a year at the fair for 74 years, said Mintz.
   The carousel's owners, Mary Blinstrup and her two children,
recently decided to sell the ride because they lost money on it in
recent years and could not make a long-term commitment to keep it at
the State Fair.
   The previous record sale price was $678,000 paid for the Fall
River, Mass., carousel at a Guernsey's auction, she said.
   In addition to the pre-auction deal involving the Minnesota
carousel, about 200 horses and other carousel carvings were put on
the block and fetched a total of about $5 million Saturday, Ettinger
said.
   ``There's an increasing awareness of this as a real American art
form,'' he said.

   Gov. Robert D. Orr said he has narrowed his
list of candidates for Vice President-elect Dan Quayle's U.S. Senate
seat to eight finalists.
   Orr said Friday that expects to name his selection sometime this
week. A final background check of the finalists was being conducted
over the weekend.
   The Indianapolis Star, in its Sunday editions, said Orr confirmed
a list finalists that the paper had learned from sources.
   The eight, all Republicans, are U.S. Reps. Dan Coats and Dan
Burton; former Indiana Secretary of State Edwin J. Simcox; state
House Speaker Paul S. Mannweiler of Indianapolis; state Rep. Patrick
J. Kiely of Anderson, chairman of the state House Ways and Means
Committee; Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz; Indianapolis Mayor William H.
Hudnut; and Marion County Prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith, the
newspaper said.
   Orr told the newspaper Friday he had reduced a group of 50
candidates for the Senate seat down to 20 to 25 names and then down
to the eight finalists.
   He said that the finalists who are from the Indianapolis area,
such as Hudnut and Goldsmith, have a slight disadvantage compared
with the other candidates because Indiana's other senator, Richard
Lugar, is from there.

<HEAD>Last of Four Men Pleads Guilty in Cross Burning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fourth man indicted in a cross burning in
front of a black family's home has pleaded guilty to federal charges
in the case.
   Clifford J. Gilmer, 23, of rural St. Clair County could be
sentenced to up to 11 years in prison and fined as much as $350,000
for his role in the incident, but prosecutors have agreed to seek
less than the maximum sentence for all the men.
   Gilmer pleaded guilty Friday to a count of conspiracy against the
rights of citizens and a count of interfering with the civil rights
of citizens through intimidation.
   U.S. District Judge William Beatty said Gilmer would be sentenced
Feb. 24, along with the other men who pleaded guilty earlier in the
week. Prosecutors said the four defendants, who are all white, were
not part of an organized racist group.
   ``Many people, even as a prank, might think of doing something
like this, but it's a very serious federal offense,'' said Gilmer's
attorney, Robert Rice. ``I don't think any of them thought this was
that serious, but that's not a defense.''
   In return for Gilmer's guilty plea, federal prosecutors dismissed
a charge of using fire in a conspiracy against the rights of
citizens.
   Willie and Elsie Carter, who moved into a house around the corner
from one of the defendants in June, found the remains of the
makeshift cross and its sawhorse base in their yard in the early
morning of July 3 as they were preparing to leave for church.
   The others charged in the case entered their pleas before Beatty
the previous week. They are Robert L. Mueller, 31, Mark McIntyre,
25, and Marcus R. Schwartz, 20, all of Belleville.
   McIntyre pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge; the others
pleaded guilty to the same charges as Gilmer.

<TEXT>
   A deep fryer exploded in the kitchen of a
tavern-restaurant Saturday night, setting off a fire that destroyed
the two-story building and killed three women, authorities said.
   The fire was reported about 7 p.m. and was brought under control
two hours later, said assistant Fire Chief Roger South.
   The victims are believed to be employees of the Chunky Hunky
Baltimore Inn, which occupied the bottom floor of the building.
Their identities were not immediately available.
   Deputy Fire Chief Paul Curlis said a piece of cooking equipment
exploded and started a fire that quickly consumed the building.
   ``It appears that the deep-fat fryer exploded and ignited the
clothing of one of the women,'' Curlis said. ``The fire went up so
fast they were unable to get out.''
   It was not immediately known whether there were any patrons in
the restaurant at the time of the explosion.
   A man who was outside the building when firefighters arrived was
taken to Middletown Regional Hospital for treatment, authorities
said. A nursing supervisor said he was in fair condition.
   All of the 20 firefighters on duty in the southwestern Ohio city
and a number of off-duty personnel were called in to battle the
blaze, said South.
   An apartment occupied the second floor of the building, said
police officer Mike Combs. He said he was not sure whether anyone
was living in the apartment.
   Firefighters' efforts in battling the blaze were complicated by
thick smoke which was pouring from the building when they arrived,
South said.
   ``They're using an awful lot of air cylinders,'' to supply oxygen
for firefighters inside the building, South said.
   Middletown is a city of about 45,000 north of Cincinnati.

   More than 200 people loudly but peacefully
protested a small gathering Saturday of white supremacist
``skinheads'' marking the death of a neo-Nazi leader.
   Sheriff's deputies and state troopers tried to make sure the two
groups stayed apart as the demonstrators, carrying signs and
chanting slogans, circled in a parking lot at South Whidbey State
Park, on Whidbey Island about 35 miles northwest of Seattle.
   The skinheads, who favor favor close-cropped hair, dark clothes
and tattoos, were not as visible.
   Terry Doran, regional manager for the Washington State Parks and
Recreation Commission, said about a dozen supremacists were at a
group campsite inside the reserve, and several others were elsewhere
in the park.
   Doran said he was told the group planned a candlelight vigil for
Saturday night to commemorate the Dec. 9, 1984, death of Robert
Mathews, founder of the violent neo-Nazi group The Order.
   Mathews died at age 31 in a shootout with FBI agents at a cabin
on this mostly rural island. After his death, 22 Order members were
convicted or pleaded guilty after being indicted on racketeering
charges. They were accused of robberies that netted more than $4
million and other crimes, including the June 1984 murder of Alan
Berg, a Jewish talk-radio host in Denver.
   John Metzger, leader of the White Aryan Resistance Youth, had
called for a vigil on Whidbey Island to mark Mathews' death. Metzger
is the son of Tom Metzger, founder of the Fallbrook, Calif.-based
White Aryan Resistance, the group most active in the recent spread
of neo-Nazism among the youthful followers of the skinhead
subculture.
   Police guarded the campsite, turning away anyone not part of the
group, including reporters and photographers.
   Charlie James, a community activist from Seattle, said an
organization called United Front Against Facism chartered three
buses to bring anti-Nazi demonstrators to the park.
   ``I'm here to protest against the bigotry, the hatred and the
killing,'' said Kay Prater of Seattle, one of the demonstrators. She
carried a sign reading, ``You are next. Speak out against bigotry.''

<TEXT>
   The European Ariane 4 rocket lifted
off on its first commercial mission Saturday night after a 24-hour
delay and placed two satellites in orbit.
   The rocket blasted off at 9:34 p.m. (7:34 p.m. EST) from the
Kourou space center on the Atlantic coast of French Guiana, on the
northern coast of South America.
   About 30 minutes later, it deployed a satellite to broadcast TV
directly into European homes and another to be used for British
military communications, according to Arianespace President Frederic
D'Allest.
   In a last-minute hitch before liftoff, an instrument indicated a
malfunction of a valve on the third stage of the rocket. The
countdown stopped with 26 seconds left.
   But technicians checked the valve and found it in working order.
The countdown resumed after a 30-minute delay, and the launch went
on with no apparent problems.
   The countdown was halted Friday night minutes before liftoff when
a menacing storm cloud passed. It was later postponed because of a
faulty sensor on the rocket's third stage.
   The Ariane 4 model of the rocket took off just once before in a
demonstration launch last June, when it placed three satellites in
orbit. Saturday's launch represents the first commercial mission for
the latest, more powerful and versatile version of the Ariane
rockets.
   Arianespace is a private French-based consortium entrusted with
commercial launches of the Ariane rockets developed by the
13-national European Space Agency. The manufacture and assembly of
rocket components are divided among dozens of European companies to
give each country benefits proportional to its investment in
research and development.
   The European program has benefited from the troubles of the U.S.
space shuttle related to the explosion of the Challenger in 1986.
The Ariane program now has 40 satellites on its order book for
future launches.
   The Astra 1A satellite, owned by a Luxembourg-based consortium,
is designed to broadcast 16 channels of television programs that can
be received by home dishes as small as two-feet wide.
   Eleven of the channels are already sold, and plans are to begin
broadcasts in late January, offering all-news, all-sports,
all-movies and other programming available to 85 percent of West
European homes.
   Astra officials say they could eventually serve 55 million homes
directly and 25 million more via master antenna systems.
   Australian publisher and station owner Rupert Murdoch's News
International Group is the chief client.
   Another Ariane rocket last month launched a French competitor,
TDF-1, but it has not yet lined up programming for its six channels.
   The other satellite carried by Ariane 4, Britain's Skynet 4B,
represents the first of four such satellites which together will
provide a communications network for British navy submarines,
surface ships and ground stations.

   Footloose students at Purdy High School broke a
100-year-old tradition Saturday night when they held the first dance
in the school's history in a gymnasium decorated with stars and
streamers.
   The students began filing into the gymnasium about 10:15 p.m. for
the dance after the Purdy basketball team lost to Billings High
School, 61-56. Most of the students were casually dressed, wearing
jeans and sweaters. But they seemed excited about being the first
students to dance in the school's gymnasium.
   ``I expect to have a really good time,'' said sophomore Ryan
Deayre, who moved to Purdy five years ago. ``I thought it was going
to be a dull town. Really, it's not a dull town anymore. I just wish
last year's seniors had had a chance to go to this dance.''
   The dance was limited to the 161 students in grades nine through
12 because school officials did not want anyone to disrupt it.
Journalists were allowed into the decorated gymnasium before the
dance.
   The school's ban on dancing, which brought national attention in
the wake of the hit movie ``Footloose'' about a similar ban in a
fictional town, was ruled unconstitutional this summer by a federal
judge.
   ``It's great,'' said senior Rhonda Robberson, who was crowned
homecoming queen Saturday night. ``It's a wonderful feeling. It's
going to be something I'll always remember.''
   The gymnasium at Purdy High School was transformed into a tent
from the Arabian Nights with stars hanging overhead.
   Students worked throughout the day stringing blue and white
streamers and hanging the stars, which recalled the theme of the
evening ``Waiting for a Star to Fall,'' a popular ballad by the rock
group Boy Meets Girl. Star-covered balloons were scattered over the
gymnasium floor.
   The lead plaintiff in the suit, Jonathan Clayton, could not
attend the dance because he is now attending business school in
Kansas City.
   He said he was disappointed, but ``it's still worth it. The idea
was to allow Purdy students to have a dance and we did that.''
   Superintendent Sheldon Buxton said alumni and other non-students
were kept out of the dance because he feared outsiders bent on
disruption would be attracted by publicity.
   ``This is our homecoming,'' he said. ``The kids are excited about
the dance.''
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ruled that the ban promoted the
values of those who oppose dancing for religious reasons. The board
appealed, but a federal appeals court allowed the dance to go on
while it considers the issue.
   Although barred from dancing at school, Purdy students have held
dances at the community center or in neighboring towns. But they
said that was inconvenient and unfair.
   ``I already live way outside of Purdy,'' said junior Anna
Svetlecic. ``My freshman year, I couldn't go to the homecoming dance
because it was too far. If we have them at school, everybody can
go.''
   Miss Svetlecic decided to go to the dance even though her
boyfriend, no longer a student, was not allowed to attend. She said
she didn't want to miss history in the making.
   Miss Svetlecic said she had been to only two dances _ one held at
the community center her freshman year, another staged in Kansas
City as a benefit for the lawsuit that challenged the dance ban.
   ``A lot of people have never even been to a dance,'' she said.
``They know how to dance, they just never got a chance.''
   Purdy residents say feelings ran high over the dance issue in the
farming community of about 900, in the Ozarks of southern Missouri.
   Supporters of the ban were known to cross the street to avoid
meeting someone in favor of the dance. About 250 people turned out
at a school board meeting in 1986, most favoring the dance ban.
   Students circulated petitions and held rallies in support of
dancing. They invited the stars of ``Footloose,'' a movie about a
fictional town with a dance ban, to a rally in 1986, but actors
Kevin Bacon and Christopher Penn did not attend.
   Three teachers volunteered as chaperones for the dance.
   School officials ``wouldn't even have the parents as
chaperones,'' said Walter Welch, whose daughter, Sherry, is a
student at Purdy High. ``We would have helped, we always do. But I
guess they wanted to do it themselves this time.''

   Rival groups of Moslem fundamentalist
students battled with knives, chains, and sticks, and about 100 were
wounded, authorities said Saturday. A police officer was fatally
stabbed in Cairo, police sources said.
   Police and sources at Assiut University, where the clashes broke
out, said none of the students was seriously injured in the fighting
Wednesday and Thursday. However, tension remained high between
students of a militant faction known as Gamaat Islamiya and campus
members of the moderate Moslem Brotherhood.
   In Cairo, police sources said a nationwide search was under way
for a Moslem extremist suspected of fatally stabbing a senior police
officer in the working-class district of Ein Shams on Thursday.
   Security forces have rounded up more than 130 religious
extremists in Ein Shams since Wednesday, the sources said.
   Sixty-one were detained in a police sweep of fundamentalists'
homes in the Ein Shams area at dawn Wednesday as police followed up
a tip about an alleged sabotage conspiracy. Police found two
incendiary bombs, many knives and chains, and anti-government
leaflets.
   The Cairo police sources said 72 other extremists were rounded up
Thursday and Friday, 50 of them just outside an Ein Shams police
station they attacked with stones and flaming objects.
   But the state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram put the total number of
arrested at 186. It said they were charged with resisting
authorities, possessing and using explosives and knives, and
damaging public and private property.
   The clashes between student groups started at the university in
Assiut, about 240 miles south of Cairo. The campus has been a center
of Moslem extremist activity for years.
   Followers of the two groups have been feuding for months over
religious differences, such as which side should be allowed to
deliver sermons in the mosques.
   Both moderates and extremists support implementation of Sharia,
the Islamic legal and ethical code that was introduced about 14
centuries ago in the Moslem holy book, the Koran.
   Extremists advocate using violence, if necessary, in support of
the Moslem laws, while the Brotherhood says it is in favor of
peaceful action. The government contends more than 90 percent of
Egyptian laws already conform to the laws of Islam.

   A Soviet military transport plane carrying soldiers
to help rescue victims of the Armenian earthquake crashed Sunday,
killing 79 people aboard, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said the crash occurred as the
Ilyushin-76 plane was approaching the airport in Leninakan, the
northern Armenian city near the epicenter of Wednesday's earthquake
that officials say killed at least 40,000 people.
   Nine crewmembers and 70 soldiers were killed in the crash, Tass
reported in a brief dispatch in the form of a message of condolences
from the Communist Party Central Committee and government. It did
not say how many people in all were aboard the heavy wide-body plane
and provided no further details.
   ``With a feeling of grief and compassion we express profound
condolences to the relatives and dear ones of the killed, who
hurried to help the fraternal Armenian people and earned the eternal
gratitude of the Soviet people,'' the message said.
   A massive international relief effort is under way to aid victims
from the temblor that measured 6.9 on the Richter scale. Officials
say at least 12,000 were hurt and a half-million are homeless.
   No weather problems were likely to have contributed to the crash,
the Soviet Meteorological Center told The Associated Press.
   Jane's All the World's Aircraft, a British reference book, says
the Ilyushin-76 is designed to land on short airstrips under
difficult weather conditions. It says the plane, which went into
service in 1971, has four-turbofan engines and can carry 40 tons of
freight.

   The showplace mansion of the late Liberace, once
on the market for $2.8 million, sold at auction for $325,000 to fans
who said they wanted to preserve the memory of the flamboyant
entertainer.
   The estate about two miles from the Las Vegas Strip, where
Liberace was a headline performer for years, continues to draw
dozens of tour buses and taxicabs daily full of tourists seeking a
glimpse of the glittery pianist's home, said auctioneer Eric Nelson.
   James Harvey Sedger of Las Vegas, a retired oilman, and Lorna
Burroughs, a housewife from Phoenix, Ariz., pooled funds to make the
winning bid Saturday night.
   ``We plan to open it as a museum in his memory,'' Mrs. Burroughs
said after signing a deposit check and contract to buy the property.
``We want to keep it open to the public and preserve it as a
remembrance of his showmanship.''
   Sedger, 52, tossed his cowboy hat skyward in celebration when a
crowd of more than 100 well-dressed bidders failed to top his
successful bid.
   ``We're just trying to preserve a little bit of history,'' Sedger
said.
   The palatial, 10,549-square-foot home was originally listed at
$2.8 million after Liberace's death from AIDS complications in
February 1987.
   The home features a giant master bedroom with a painting of the
Sistine Chapel frescoes on the ceiling. The painting, by an Italian
artist, took nearly two years to complete.
   Between two bedrooms, at the end of a marble, mirrored hallway
called the eternal mirrors hallway, is a fountain and a sunken
bathtub, with a painting of Liberace on the ceiling.
   The patio area includes a pool, sauna, courtyard and dancing
fountains, a smaller version of the dancing waters attraction
Liberace used in his stage act.
   The home was stripped of furnishings earlier this year for
auctions in Southern California. Proceeds from the sale will go to
the Liberace Foundation for the Performing and Creative Arts, which
funds scholarships at 26 colleges and universities nationwide.

   A plan to provide Christmas gifts for
Indian children has saddled the governor's Office of Indian Affairs
with a mountain of unwanted doggy treats.
   A 48-foot semi-truck load of donated Christmas gifts arrived from
New Jersey last month, containing several dozen stuffed animals and
other toys. But it mostly contained boxes of rawhide bones and chew
toys.
   ``After we cried and dried our eyes, we all had a good laugh,''
said Jennifer Scott, assistant director for the Office of Indian
Affairs.
   Ms. Scott had arranged for toys with Rick Rowe, an inmate at East
Jersey State Prison in Rahway, N.J., who for the past 11 years has
been able to persuade toy companies to donate gifts to American
Indian children and others. Spokane already has received two
truckloads.
   When the truck arrived at the Old Community Center in Olympia,
officials threw open the doors. There, stacked floor to ceiling,
were 12 dozen fluffy, stuffed animals, as well as key chains, mugs,
balloons and mixed candy.
   But behind the stuffed animals were 586 cases of doggy treats _
12 dozen treats to a case.
   ``Two-thirds of it was doggy treats,'' Ms. Scott said.
   Ms. Scott's staff distributed all of the toys and many of the
doggy treats to the tribes. But cases of doggy treats in plastic
Christmas stockings remained.
   Ms. Scott hopes Rowe can find one more truckload of toys before
Christmas.
   ``We're on the top of his list, but it's getting late,'' she said.

<HEAD>Quake Insurance Demand Skyrocketing In Western Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homeowners who apparently were
alarmed by recent earthquakes in the Soviet Union and eastern Canada
are clamoring for quake insurance, industry officials say.
   Seismologists say the area has the potential for a damaging quake.
   ``Sixty percent of our customers are now asking for it,'' said
Barry Forbes, regional vice president of Wellington Insurance Co.
   Forbes said many callers in western Canada cited the temblor that
devastated Soviet Armenia last week and an earlier one that did less
damage in Quebec.
   ``Insurance brokers expect this interest will dry up as the
impact of the recent quake in the Soviet Union dies down,'' he said.
   Even before the recent quakes, however, concern about a temblor
strong enough to damage homes had been growing for about three
years, said Brian Stanhope, regional vice president of the Insurance
Bureau of Canada.
   Earthquake insurance costs less than $100 Canadian for a home
valued at $100,000, said Jack Adams of Adams Greer Insurance.
   Seismologist Garry Rogers of the Pacific Geoscience Center at
Sidney on Vancouver Island said a quake serious enough to cause
significant damage, about 6 on the Richter scale, could hit Canada's
West Coast at any time.
   In fact, insurance companies view earthquake damage as the
greatest disaster potential for that part of Canada and fear the
claims they could face if one occurred, Stanhope said.
   He said he took out quake insurance on his own home last month.
   ``Sooner or later we are going to have an earthquake,'' Stanhope
said. ``There's no doubt about that.''

<TEXT>
   Kenya celebrates 25 years of independence
Monday, its famed game parks full of tourists, its economy growing
and towering new buildings rising along the capital's broad,
tree-lined avenues.
   But while the East African nation often is singled out as an
economic example for the rest of impoverished Africa, some Western
observers have become increasingly concerned about its human rights
record under the authoritarian rule of President Daniel arap Moi.
   Moi has ruled Kenya for 10 years under the slogan of ``Nyayo,'' a
Swahili word meaning footsteps. Banners and signs praising the
president and carrying the slogan adorn buildings and roads
throughout the country.
   The footsteps to be followed were originally those of Jomo
Kenyatta, a leader of the struggle against British rule who became
the country's first president in 1964, a year after independence. He
held the post until his death in 1978.
   Today, however, the footsteps to be followed are clearly Moi's.
   Moi is firmly anti-communist, has no apparent affinity for
Africa's military rulers and follows generally conservative economic
policies _ all of which has won him favor in Washington. But his
style of governing is iron-fisted and his word is law.
   Disssent is little tolerated. Opposition political parties are
banned by law, and the parliament routinely endorses government
initiatives with little or no debate.
   The government owns the country's only radio and television
stations and one of the three leading newspapers in Nairobi. There
is no official censorship, but even independent newspapers dare not
attack Moi's policies.
   Virtually the only internal criticism of the government these
days comes from some clergymen and attorneys. Even this is generally
couched in terms gentle enough not to anger the president.
   Parliament this year adopted a constitutional amendment that
gives Moi the right to dismiss judges, a move some lawyers
criticized as eroding the court's independence. Another amendment
empowering police to hold suspects in capital crimes for up to 14
days without charge also drew criticism.
   About 100 people are serving prison terms after being convicted
of having links with three clandestine organizations purportedly
plotting to overthrow Moi's government. Many of those convictions
were based on what critics called tainted confessions.
   It is the continuing crackdown against dissidents, which began
about three years ago, that has brought the strongest condemnation
from civil rights groups and individuals outside Kenya.
   The London-based Amnesty International human rights group has
accused Moi's government of subjecting dissidents to torture, phony
trials and disappearances for ``prolonged periods in unacknowledged
and unlawful custody.''
   Sen. Edward F. Kennedy last month urged the Kenyan government to
``pull back from darkness of torture and represession and return to
the bright sunlight of freedom, tolerance and the rule of law.
   ``Will Kenya go forward with its campaign of intimidation and
fear?'' asked the Democrat from Massachusets.
   The words were perhaps the harshest criticism of Moi's policies
yet voiced in the United States. They came at a Washington ceremony
in which the 1988 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award was bestowed
in absentia on a Kenyan lawyer barred from leaving his country.
   Moi has called Amnesty International an ``agent of imperialists''
but has so far ignored Kennedy's remarks. The government has
consistently denied torture allegations, and several prison guards
and police officers have been charged in recent months with
mistreating civilians.
   The 64-year-old Moi, who seems to enjoy widespread popularity
among his people, makes no apologies for the crackdown against
dissidents.
   ``My responsibility is to defend a majority of peace-loving
Kenyans,'' he has said repeatedly.
   With dissent stifled, Kenya enjoys a political stability little
known in many parts of a continent torn by civil wars and tribal
conflicts. And while massive poverty still exists in large parts of
the country, its economy is nevertheless the envy of many of its
neighbors.
   Tourists, lured by Kenya's Indian Ocean beaches and the
elephants, lions, rhinos and other exotic animals that roam its
national parks, pumped nearly $350 million into the economy last
year. That ranked second only to agriculture, which not only fed the
nation's burgeoning population but exported nearly half a billion
dollars worth of coffee, tea and other commodities.
   But warning flags are flying for the economy.
   Slightly smaller than the state of Texas, Kenya has a population
of 22 million that is growing at a rate of 3.8 percent a year, one
of the highest in the world.
   By the turn of the century, the population is forecast to be 35
million, possibly outstripping the country's ability to feed itself.
   Only 20 percent of Kenya's mostly arid land is tillable, and that
portion already is severely overcrowded.

   More than 5,000 leftist demonstrators
marched through Athens on Sunday calling for the removal of U.S.
military bases in Greece.
   ``Out with the bases of death,'' the demonstrators chanted as
they marched through the city center and gathered at the foot of
parliament to demonstrate.
   The demonstration, organized by the Panhellenic Movement for the
Removal of the Bases, came at the end of a two-day conference on
foreign military bases in the Mediterranean region.
   A declaration issued after the conference called on Premier
Andreas Papandreou's socialist government to get rid of the four
U.S. bases when their current operating agreement expires in
mid-December.
   Greece and the United States are negotiating a new bases
agreement to replace the existing five-year accord, but officials
from both countries say there has been little progress after a year
of talks.
   Four U.S. bases have operated in Greece since the early 1950s _
two near Athens and two on the southern Aegean island of Crete.

   Pope John Paul II on Sunday elevated to
sainthood a 19th century Spanish nun who founded a religious order
dedicated to helping the needy.
   The pope canonized Maria Rosa Molas Y Vallve in a solemn ceremony
in St. Peter's Basilica attended by 10,000 people, including 4,000
pilgrims from Spain.
   The nun, who lived from 1815 to 1876, was beatified by Pope Paul
VI in 1977.
   She founded the Congregation of Sisters of Our Lady of
Consolation to assist the sick and elderly, abandoned children and
other disadvanted people.
   In his homily, the pope said of the nun that ``although she lived
in difficult times, she gave proof of her profound faith, like so
many other saints and noble souls of Spain who were promoters of a
significant ecclesiastical renewal.''

   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Major Gen.
Choe Ui Ung sent a letter protesting the alleged incident to the
South Korean government. The news report, dated Saturday, was seen
in Tokyo on Sunday.
   ``The South Korean side sent balloons with igniters by taking
advantage of the wind into the demilitarized zone ... thus burning
several hectares of area on our side,'' the news agency said. It
said the incident occurred Wednesday.
   A similar incident occurred Nov. 29 in the DMZ, which separates
the two countries, the agency said.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South following World War II.

   Pope John Paul II has accepted an

   In a report over the weekend, the official MTI news agency quoted
the pope's letter to Straub as saying:
   ``I'm happy to inform you that I have accepted the invitation in

between the noble Hungarian nation and the Apostolic Holy See, and
it will also be an occasion to strengthen the Sons of the Catholic

<HEAD>Bush The Conservative Turns to Pragmatic Moderates For Cabinet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite some sharply conservative campaign
rhetoric, President-elect Bush so far has proposed filling his
Cabinet with moderate Republicans known more for their pragmatism
than their ideology.
   Political analysts debated during the fall campaign whether the
vice president was a Reagan Republican, as many of his speeches
seemed to suggest, or was more easily identified with the
progressive wing of the party once led by the late Nelson A.
Rockefeller.
   As the next Cabinet takes shape and the real George Bush stands
up, the analysts are suggesting that he falls somewhere between
Reagan and Rockefeller, more in line with the mainstream
Republicanism practiced by former Presidents Nixon and Ford.
   ``Up to now, his administration looks like a carbon copy of
himself. He has picked other people who, up to a point, are white,
middle-aged, well-to-do, moderate conservatives, comfortable in
government,'' said Stephen Hess, a political analyst at the
Brookings Institution, a politically liberal research organization.
   ``He has some of the pragmatism of Nixon. He basically thinks of
himself as a problem-solver,'' Hess said.
   Bush's appointments so far are giving some conservatives pause.
Other observers are waiting for Bush to make good on his pledge to
appoint ``new faces,'' including more minorities, to his
administration.
   Thus far, the most conservative member of Bush's team may be New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, whom the vice president has designated
as his White House chief of staff.
   Expect more conservative appointments in the days to come, Sununu
said in a recent interview.
   ``George Bush is trying to reach out to a lot of groups. But his
base is really the conservative base, and you're going to see the
conservative base in there,'' Sununu said.
   Asked about the prospects of more conservatives joining Bush's
Cabinet, Sununu replied that ``I think there'll be a lot more than
(former Texas Sen.) John Tower if John Tower gets appointed'' as
defense secretary.
   Transition sources, who spoke only on condition they not be
identified, said discussions are under way with conservative Rep.
Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., for a Cabinet post, most likely the department of
Housing and Urban Development, although no firm deal had yet been
struck.
   Paul Weyrich, leader of the conservative Free Congress
Foundation, suggested that Bush's choices so far have given short
shrift to the conservatives who played a key part in his election
last month.
   ``You can't separate a campaign from government. They are part of
a continuum, and the coaltion that was put together to elect him is
the coaltion that needs to be kept together to help him govern,''
Weyrich said.
   The one part of the Bush team that is complete is the economic
unit, and none of its members is a rigid adherent of one economic
theory or another.
   They are former New York investment banker Nicholas Brady as
treasury secretary, Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher as commerce
secretary, lawyer Carla Hills as trade representative and Stanford
University economist Michael Boskin as chief economic adviser.
   ``I think he got rid of all the supply-siders,'' said private
economist Michael Evans. He was referring to the school of economic
thought embraced by Reagan _ and initially ridiculed by Bush _ that
contended the budget deficit could be ended by a surge in economic
growth with deep tax cuts and a big increase in military spending.
   ``I think the people who have been picked, based on what they've
said in the past, are real good, level-headed people. I just hope
they don't go off the deep end trying to please the president,''
said Evans, an early critic of Reagan's supply-side economics.
   Analysts of both parties are suggesting that Bush has not yet
named any ideological hardliners of the type that filled the ranks
of the Reagan administration.
   Other pragmatic GOP moderates named so far by Bush include his
longtime friend and former treasury secretary James A. Baker III as
secretary of state, and retired Air Force Gen. Brent Scowcroft as
national security adviser.
   Brady, whom Reagan appointed last summer when Baker left the
Treasury to become Bush's campaign chairman, is an old friend of the
vice president's.
   A wealthy New York investment banker who served briefly as a U.S.
senator from New Jersey, Brady was chairman of the government
commission that investigated the October 1987 stock market plunge.
He is viewed as being in the same pragmatic mold as Baker. So is
Richard Darman, Bush's choice for budget director and a former
deputy treasury secretary under Baker.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was opposed by conservative
Republicans at first, but most of them ended up supporting
Thornburgh over some of the other contenders under discussion.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, who fulfills Bush's pledge to
name a Hispanic to the Cabinet, is far more moderate than his
predecessor, William Bennett, and already has won over some of the
teacher groups alienated by Bennett.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Judge Releases Scientology Church Members On $1.1 Million
Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Church of Scientology
and 10 other members arrested in an investigation of alleged fraud
and tax evasion have been released on $1.1 million bail, their
lawyer said Sunday.
   A judge's order releasing church President Heber Jentzsch, an
American, and the others came Saturday after facts were presented
that ``corrected'' some allegations against the group, said the
lawyer, Jose Luis Chamorro.
   Jentzsch, 53, a native of Salt Lake City, is a resident of Los
Angeles.
   The judge, Jose Maria Vazquez Honrubia, could not be reached to
confirm the bail order was issued. On Dec. 5, he said he would not
grant bail and that he had at least three months to file formal
charges against Jentzsch.
   The 11 were among 71 people arrested Nov. 20 after a nine-month
probe ordered by Vazquez Honrubia, who says Narconon, a
church-linked drug rehabilitation program, swindled its clients and
lured them into Scientology.
   Authorities have also frozen $1.76 million in bank accounts
belonging to officials of the church and Narconon because Vazquez
Honrubia says the money was not declared to tax authorities.
   After questioning all 71 people arrested in the raid, Vazquez
Honrubia expelled 10 foreigners and released 50 others.
   Chamorro said those released Saturday must appear before the
judge three times a week as part of the bail conditions accepted
after hearing arguments by a six-man team of Spanish lawyers.
   Scientology officials in Madrid said Jentzsch has nothing to do
with church finances and could not have committed any crimes in
Spain since he had never been in the country before November.
   Another Scientologist and friend of Jentzsch, jazz pianist Chick
Corea, appeared in Madrid Nov. 26 to defend the jailed leader.
   The other 10 members released Saturday include American Gerald
Finn, a South African man, a Portuguese woman and seven Spaniards,
three of them women, Chamorro said, declining to give further
information on those released.
   The Church of Scientology, founded in the 1950s by L. Ron
Hubbard, an American science fiction author and former U.S. Navy
officer, is based on Hubbard's 1949 book, ``Dianetics: the modern
science of mental health.''
   Followers strive toward a ``clear state'' by using a lie
detector-type device called an ``E-Meter,'' coupled with exercise
and counseling.
   Hubbard held the position of founder and executive director of
the church, while Jentzsch is president.
   The Spanish Justice Ministry has twice denied the International
Church of Scientology status as a religious entity.

<HEAD>Government Reports Increase in Local Jail Population</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's local jail population rose 32
percent in four years, the government reported Sunday, as police
made more arrests and facilities housed increasing numbers of
inmates from overcrowded state and federal prisons.
   The population of city, township and county jails was 296,873 on
June 30, 1987, compared to 223,551 for the same day four years
earlier, said the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The mid-1987 level
was up 8 percent from the previous year, when it was 274,444.
   Jails nationwide operated at 98 percent of their capacities in
1987 compared to 85 percent of capacity in 1983, according to the
annual survey.
   The increases in jail population were fed by larger numbers of
arrests during the four-year period and by the transfer of federal
and state prisoners into jail systems, said Susan Kline of the
bureau's staff, who compiled a report based on the jail data.
   Arrests of men rose 8 percent from 1983 to 1987 while arrests of
women rose 17 percent in that time, according to information
compiled by the FBI from police departments around the country.
Correspondingly, the number of women in jails rose 53 percent in the
four-year period, to 23,920 while the number of men rose 31 percent
to 295,873.
   The number of federal and state prisoners being held in local
jails was 26,800 in mid-1987, up by more than 3,600 in 12 months. As
of mid-1987, about 87 percent of large jail systems with at least
100 inmates were holding inmates for federal or state authorities.
   The government surveyed jails administered by city, township or
county officials holding inmates usually for more than 48 hours
following their arraignment.
   The study excluded temporary lockups, federal and state prisons,
private correctional facilities and the combined jail-and-prison
systems in half-a-dozen states.

<HEAD>Husband May Pose Conflict-Of-Interest Problems For Carla Hills</HEAD>

   Carla Hills, nominated to be the new U.S. trade
representative, may pose conflict-of-interest problems for the Bush
administration because her husband is a private trade consultant.
   Mrs. Hills, former secretary of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development and the only woman tapped by President-elect Bush
for a senior administration post, has promised to do everything
necessary to avoid any conflicts of interest.
   Her husband, Roderick Hills, is a former chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and is chairman of the Manchester
Group Ltd., an international trade consulting firm that specializes
in investment banking.
   If a situation presents a conflict, he said, ``I just won't do it
any more.''
   But Hills acknowledged in an interview that his wife's
prospective new job could put a damper on his business. He isn't
worried, though.
   ``I've even run a coal mine once, so there are plenty of things
to do,'' he said.
   Hills, a lawyer, said he does ``very little trade work'' these
days, although a primary interest is international finance. He said
much of his time is spent helping ailing companies.
   If the Senate confirms his wife's nomination and she takes her
Cabinet-level post as trade representative, Hills said, ``I don't
see off-hand any problem with the trade finance area so far as we
don't get into anything ... that requires the discretionary
activities of the federal government.''
   The Hills were spending part of the weekend with Bush transition
aides, reviewing the couple's financial dealings. Hills said they
might be required to transfer some of their investments into other
funds.
   The situation facing the Hills is becoming increasingly common in
an era when both spouses are employed. Federal conflict-of-interest
statutes prohibit government employees from taking any action that
would affect their financial interest or the interest of a spouse,
dependent child or business partner.
   David Martin, former head of the Office of Government Ethics,
said Mrs. Hills will have to be ``very, very careful'' about her
husband's business.
   As the trade representative, Mrs. Hills will negotiate trade
agreements with foreign countries and formulate administration trade
policy.
   Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for the Bush transition team, said the
staff was confident Mrs. Hills and her husband would satisfy any
questions about potential conflicts.
   Conservatives have raised questions about Mrs. Hills' ability to
remain neutral in light of her husband's work.
   ``It's shocking to learn that the next head of the key post of
U.S. trade representative may be someone so vulnerable to potential
conflict-of-interest charges in trade-related matters,'' said
Anthony Harrigan, president of the U.S. Business and Industrial
Council, a group of conservative business leaders.
   Until August, Hills was registered as a foreign agent for C.
Itoh, a Japanese company. He ``monitored legislative and regulatory
activities'' for them, according to forms filed with the Justice
Department.
   Hills also has been a consultant to Manchester Associates, a
group that has had dealings with the trade representative on behalf
of clients such as Nissan Motor Co. and the Korean Traders
Association. In 1986, Hills did work for Korean Air Lines.
   Mrs. Hills, a lawyer in the Washington office of the New
York-based law firm of Weil, Gotshal and Manges, also has worked for
foreign companies, according to a Jan. 19, 1987, article in Legal
Times. She represented Crown Forest Industries Ltd. and British
Columbia Forest Products in a lumber trade fight between the United
States and Canada, the report said.
   Mrs. Hills did not return a telephone call to discuss what she
did for the firms.
   Mrs. Hills' nomination is expected to be approved by the Senate
Finance Committee despite the opposition of some conservatives who
regard her as too liberal.
   Paul Weyrich, a conservative organizer, said he told Bush at a
meeting Friday that ``I can't rally the conservative movement for
Carla Hills.''
   Mrs. Hills' politics have been an issue since 1973 when she was
nominated as assistant attorney general, according to a document
released Friday by the National Archives. At the time, she was a
lawyer in Los Angeles, and President Reagan was governor of
California.
   ``Governor Reagan has cleared her for this position but has not
endorsed her,'' the White House memo said. ``She is considered a
liberal by Reagan's standards ...'' Mrs. Hills subsequently went to
the Justice Department, where she received high marks for her
performance.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee,
predicted Mrs. Hills would be confirmed by the Senate, but he
questioned her knowledge of trade issues.
   ``I had hoped, frankly, that we'd have someone from the business
world who had extensive international experience in trade,'' Bentsen
said.

   The nation's public school teachers say they
are not getting enough support from parents, and most report
problems such as child abuse, poor health and bad nutrition among
the children in their classrooms, according to a survey released
Sunday.
   Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, said the survey of 22,000 teachers found a
sense of frustration in the classroom, both at ``the lack of support
they receive from parents'' and from a feeling of ``powerlessness in
teaching.''
   ``Large majorities of teachers find poverty, poor health,
undernourishment and neglect to be problems at their schools,'' said
Boyer in his foreword to the report, ``The Condition of Teaching.''
   Teachers from every state were canvassed in twin surveys
conducted by mail in the spring and fall of 1987.
   Among the findings:
   _90 percent said lack of parental support was a problem at their
schools.
   _89 percent said there were abused or neglected children at their
schools.
   _69 percent said poor health was a problem for their students.
   _68 percent said some children were undernourished.
   ``Teachers repeatedly made the point that in the push for better
schools they cannot do the job alone, and yet there is a growing
trend to expect schools to do what families, communities and
churches have been unable to accomplish,'' said Boyer.
   Teachers in the survey described their students ``as `emotionally
needy' and `starved for attention and affection,''' Boyer said.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, said the report's ``disturbing statistics'' underscores
the need for parental involvement.
   ``I wish I could sit down with every parent in America and
emphasize how important they are to their children's education,''
Ms. Futrell said in a statement. ``Parents are a child's first _ and
potentially the most influential _ teachers.''
   The NEA president said ``even the best teachers cannot go it
alone. Teachers need allies. And the allies they need most are
parents.''
   The average public school teacher earned $28,031 in 1987-88,
according to figures from the NEA.
   Forty-nine percent of the teachers in the Carnegie survey said
their pay was worse than they expected; 41 percent said it was about
what they expected, and 10 percent said it was better. The average
teacher surveyed had 16 years experience.
   The average teacher faced 79 students on a typical day, with
elementary teachers working with 60 different pupils and secondary
teachers 114.
   The typical class size was 23. Sixty-two percent of the teachers
said their most typical class was about the right size; 36 percent
felt it was too large, and 1 percent said it was too small (The
figures do not add up to 100 percent because of rounding).
   Most teachers said the school reform movement had led to greater
state regulation of local schools. Fifty-nine percent said the
reform movement has increased political interference in education;
37 percent said it had not changed the amount of interference, and 4
percent said it decreased interference.
   Only 7 percent of the teachers surveyed said they planned to quit
the profession as soon as they could. Fifty-six percent planned to
teach until they retire; 21 percent said they probably would
continue teaching; 10 percent were undecided about their career
plans, and 6 percent said they may take time off from teaching.
   The Carnegie Foundation, based in Princeton, N.J., published
earlier ``Condition of Teaching'' reports in 1983 and 1985. It said
the overall margin of error on the unusually large survey was only
plus or minus 1 percent.

   Wynonna Judd says she is no longer a
``jerk'' now that she and her mother, Naomi, are a successful
country vocal duo.
   The two recently marked the release of ``The Judds' Greatest
Hits,'' which was certified gold five years after the pair entered
the Nashville music scene with No. 1 ``Mama He's Crazy.''
   ``Success has helped me to feel confident,'' Wynonna Judd said.
``A lot of it is just feeling that Wynonna Judd's an OK person.
She's not a jerk anymore.
   ``I was very insecure: my weight, insecure about boys, just
everything that kids go through. Now for the first time in my life I
feel like I have one thing that no one can take away from me.
   ``I can look at these walls at RCA and see our platinum albums
and know that my one true great gift is music,'' the 24-year-old
singer said in a recent interview at RCA's Music Row office.

   Princess Anne, president of the Save The Children
charity and only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, says she doesn't
much like children.
   In an interview being screened Sunday on London Weekend
Television, a commercial station, Anne, 38, said that when she
became interested in the fund in the 1970s, ``I wasn't particularly
keen on children _ and I'm still not.''
   ``But you don't actually have to like children very much to be
interested in giving them the best possible start in life,'' said
Anne, who has two children. ``And that is quite important for a lot
of people to remember.''
   A transcript of the 55-minute interview, the longest TV interview
ever given by a member of the British royal family, was released
Saturday.
   Anne and her husband, Capt. Mark Phillips, have an 11-year-old
son, Peter, and 7-year-old daughter, Zara.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Michael Jackson, Eddie
Murphy, Whoopi Goldberg and Clint Eastwood were among those honored
at the 21st annual NAACP Image Awards.
   ``Coming To America'' was named best movie and NBC's ``The Cosby
Show'' best TV comedy at a National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People ceremony honoring black achievement.
   Saturday night's show will be broadcast Jan. 14 on NBC.
   Jesse Jackson received an award for public service. Eastwood, who
directed ``Bird,'' which chronicled the life of jazz musician
Charlie Parker, received a special award for using blacks in his
films in positive, non-stereotypical roles, said NAACP spokeswoman
Dawna Culpepper.
   Eastwood thanked the NAACP and said he looked forward to the day
when such racial awards would be ``obsolete.''
   Murphy, who starred in ``Coming To America,'' was named black
entertainer of the year. Michael Jackson was honored as best male
recording artist and for best album, ``Bad.'' He also shared a
humanitarian award with singer Lou Rawls.
   Miss Goldberg was named best film actress for her work in ``Fatal
Beauty.''

   U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Otis
Bowen says he's looking forward to retiring to his tiny hometown of
Bremen, and he's leaving 36 years of public service with no regrets.
   ``I think it helped me understand problems a little bit better,''
Bowen said. ``I have no quarrel with anyone who wants to go into
public service. Politics is only as dirty as people let it become.''
   Bowen began his political career as county coroner, served two
terms as governor in the 1970s, then in December 1985 became the
first physician ever to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.
   His term at the agency, which has almost 120,000 employees, ends
Jan. 20.
   ``I am looking forward to retiring to my five-acre plot in Bremen
and do the usual things that a retired person should do,'' Bowen
said in an interview published Sunday in The Indianapolis Star.
   ``That's read a little more, write some, travel and be of
whatever use I can to my community and state. That doesn't mean
running for office or accepting any full-time position in anything.''

   Nine-year-old Ayana Takada, who says she's been
listening to the music of Michael Jackson as long as she can
remember, was selected Sunday as the 4 millionth person to attend a
concert of Jackson's world tour.
   Jackson, who opened the last leg of his world tour in Tokyo
Friday night, brought the girl on stage during his performance
Sunday and presented her with a certificate commemorating the event.
   By the time he winds up his 12-nation tour, the rock star is
expected to have performed before a record 4.4 million fans,
according to tour organizers.
   Jackson, 30, embarked on his first international solo tour in
Japan in September 1987, playing before sold-out crowds in 14
concerts.
   Jackson wants to retire from the tour circuit after winding up
his show in Japan on Dec. 26, said his manager, Frank Dileo.
   ``This is probably the last time Michael will be on tour,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's official radio reported
Sunday that a Pakistani warplane shot down a commercial jet flying
inside Afghanistan and that all 25 people aboard died.
   Radio Kabul said the Pakistan fighter plane downed the
Soviet-made Antonov-26 commercial airliner about 8 p.m. Saturday as
it was flying from the eastern district of Khost to Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
   The radio broadcast, which was monitored in Islamabad, said three
children and a woman were among the dead. The report contained no
other details.
   Pakistan government officials could not be reached for comment.
   Spokesman at the Foreign Ministry have repeatedly denied charges
by the Soviet-backed Afghan government that Pakistan fighters enter
Afghan airspace.
   Afghanistan and Pakistan, which signed a U.N. accord in April
providing for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from
Afghanistan, have often charged each other with mounting air and
missile attacks.
   U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas headquartered in Pakistan have been
fighting the communist government in Kabul for the past 10 years.
   On Nov. 21, Radio Kabul accused Pakistan of shooting down a
commercial plane that had strayed into Pakistani airspace and
killing all 27 on board. The report said the aircraft strayed off
course after developing technical problems. It was shot down several
miles inside Pakistan territory.
   Pakistan acknowledged downing a plane, but identified it as a
military transport aircraft.
   A Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said in an earlier interview that Pakistan's air force has standing
orders to shoot down intruding Afghan military planes providing the
pilot is confident the downed plane will land in Pakistan territory
to prove the intrusion.

<HEAD>Agriculture Committee Plans Hearings on Handling of Forest Fires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee
says hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Service
handled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West,
including one-third of Yellowstone National Park.
   ``The major problem is that in speaking to people from the area,
you speak to two and you get three opinions,'' says Rep. Kika de la
Garza, a Texas Democrat. ``The best thing to do is to sit down and
have them all put it on the record and then sift through what
happened and see if anything needs to be done.''
   De la Garza said the hearings would focus on forest fire
practices, and ``can a catastrophe of that nature be avoided or was
it a catastrophe?''
   ``I was in Montana and I visited with some people and I have some
concern over some of the practices of the Forest Service,'' de la
Garza said in an interview last week.
   The hearings will focus on fire fighting policies, rehabilitation
of charred areas and on scientific research being done on the summer
fires, said a subcommittee staff member.
   De la Garza says the committee also plans dozens of hearings
nationwide in preparation for the 1990 Farm Bill and will look at
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's response to this year's
drought-relief legislation.
   The committee will consider a uniform pesticide labeling law and
legislation to protect ground water from agricultural pesticides and
fertilizers, de la Garza said.
   De la Garza said he hopes the House Interior Committee, which has
jurisdiction over the National Park Service, and the Agriculture
subcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the U.S. Forest
Service, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, the
worst in a century.
   The U.S. Forest Service said 5 million acres were charred in the
raging blazes, including 706,000 acres in Yellowstone.
   The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300
million fighting the summer fires, the Forest Service said. The most
severe were in and around Yellowstone and Alaska, although there
were fires in the South, California and the Pacific Northwest.
   Drought conditions, high winds and a ``tremendous build-up'' of
tinder, in Yellowstone in particular, helped make the 1988 fires the
worst in a hundred years, officials said.

   Pakistani lawmakers will choose among
four presidential candidates Monday but the incumbent, Ghulam Ishaq
Khan, is the strong favorite to win a new five-year term.
   About 800 members of the Senate, the National Assembly and the
four provincial assemblies will act as an electoral college.
   Of the four candidates, only Ishaq Khan of the conservative
Pakistan Muslim League, has the support of Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party and the right-wing opposition
alliance, headed by the Muslim League.
   The other candidates are Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan of the tiny
right-of-center Pakistan Democratic Party; Ahmed E.H. Jaffar, an
industrialist from Karachi who is an independent; and Mohammad
Nauroz Malik, a member of the National Assembly also running as an
independent.
   Ms. Bhutto said Sunday in a statement issued through Pakistan's
official news agency that she would hold a vote of confidence four
hours after the presdidential balloting Monday.
   Under Pakistan's Constitution a government leader must call a
vote of confidence within 60 days of taking power. On Dec. 1, Ms.
Bhutto became the first woman to head a Moslem country in modern
times.
   Ishaq Khan, 73, has been credited with guiding Pakistan back to
democracy after 11 years of autocratic rule under President Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq, eight of them through martial law.
   Zia and U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel were killed Aug. 17 in
an explosion that destroyed their aircraft. Investigators blamed the
crash on sabotage but could not say exactly how it was done or by
whom.
   After Zia's death, the presidency automatically passed to Senate
Chairman Ishaq Khan, a constitutional scholar with nearly 40 years
in senior administrative posts, six of them as Minister of Finance
and Commerce.
   As president, Ishaq Khan proceeded with November general
elections that were scheduled by Zia.
   A constitutional amendment Zia pushed through parliament in 1985
gave the president broad but vaguely-defined powers.
   Ms. Bhutto has called for a repeal of that amendment, which would
restore supreme political powers to the prime minister.
   A repeal would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate and
the National Assembly, but Ms. Bhutto's party has not yet introduced
the legislation.

<HEAD>Town Residents Surprised To Find They Have A Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOOLSEY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some residents of Woolsey, population 186
more or less, have just discovered they have a mayor and a city
council, and they don't like them one bit.
   Suddenly civic-minded residents have also learned that election
notices are posted on an old Coke machine in a car repair garage.
There's a city charter, too _ tucked in a drawer in a city
councilman's home.
   The charter provides for elections every September but there
haven't been any in some time because no one has run against the
incumbents. Albert Berg Sr. says he lost the mayor's job 12 years
ago to Lawrence Zeller, but Zeller said he thinks he has been mayor
now for only five or six years.
   The government meets at the fire station to discuss city business
``when something comes up,'' according to Zeller.
   ``We got a peaceful little town here,'' Councilman James Carden
said. ``We're not trying to hide anything. The people that are
complaining have been here five months, a year, if that long,'' he
told the Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution.
   People from nearby Atlanta have been moving into the area,
bringing along citified ideas of how government should operate.
   But the newcomers aren't the only ones looking surprised. Says
Cynthia Carpenter, who has lived on the town's main street for seven
years: ``Until a few months ago, we didn't know who the mayor was,
which was probably negligence on our part.''
   The town government started becoming an issue when construction
began on a convenience store on the town's main street.
   Neighbors were outraged. They got madder when they discovered
Carden had sold the land _ apparently zoned residential _ to a
developer and then, they claim, he voted with the rest of the
government to rezone the land commercial.
   Some people want an injunction to halt construction, and a recall
move is afoot.
   ``I want it stopped,'' said Earline Lockhart, who moved to town
five months ago. ``Even if the same men are re-elected I want them
to know that they aren't going to govern without the rest of us
being informed.''
   The mayor insists the land was rezoned in 1964, but residents
found a letter from the council to Fayette County building
officials, dated Dec. 8, 1987, that says the council ``has approved
the zoning of Land Lot 203 to be commercial.'' The residents take
that to mean the rezoning was done at about that time.
   There are no signs announcing council meeting times.
   The only sign announcing the September elections is posted on the
1961 Coke machine in Carden's car repair shop every August.
   ``That's the only place it's been posted. The people in Woolsey
that do not know when it's time for an election have not talked to
people in Woolsey or those on the council,'' Zeller said.
   Since 1984, the state has required towns to post election
results. Woolsey has not sent the state any results since then.
   Woolsey's fire, police, water and building inspectors are
provided by Fayette County. Woolsey's officials are not paid and
there is no city budget, city taxes or business license fees.
   Homeowners complained about the zoning flap to the Fayette County
Commission last week but the commissioners said there was nothing
they could do.
   The commissioners invited Zeller and the councilmen but they
declined to attend. Zeller said they didn't want to answer questions
from the floor.
   ``It's a very hostile thing, answering questions from the
floor,'' the mayor said.

   Museums are less secretive about thefts now
as they hope publicity will help recover stolen items and they're
paying more attention to security because one theft could mean a
loss worth millions, officials say.
   Although the annual number of thefts may not be increasing, the
value of the items stolen is, according to Constance Lowenthal,
executive director of the New York-based International Foundation
for Art Research.
   ``Security is something that museums have to think about more and
more,'' she said.
   The foundation promotes the recovery of stolen items through a
directory, published 10 times a year, of items that have been taken.
The publication is distributed internationally to art dealers,
museums, collectors and insurance companies.
   Only 12 percent of the art objects stolen are recovered, she said.
   In just the past month, four items have been taken from two
Philadelphia museums. And an Edouard Manet painting, valued at more
than $1 million, was taken from the Heckscher Museum in Huntington,
N.Y., but later recovered.
   Museums once shied away from publicizing thefts for fear of
scaring off would-be donors. Now, they are beginning to see that
publicity can help recover items, making them ``too hot to handle,''
Lowenthal said.
   She pointed to the Heckscher robbery, in which the remorseful
thief called police and told them where the painting could be
recovered.
   The foundation directory will publish descriptions of the items
taken from the two Philadelphie institutions _ the University Museum
and the Rodin Museum.
   During the early morning of Nov. 11, the University Museum lost
the world's second-largest crystal ball, a clear quartz sphere 10
inches in diameter and weighing 55 pounds, and a 2,000-year-old
Egyptian statuette of Osiris, the god of the underworld. The quartz
orb, carved in the late 19th century for the Empress Dowager of
China, is valued at up to $300,000 and the statuette is worth up to
$45,000.
   A week later, the museum discovered the theft of a Sri Lankan
mask from a hands-on exhibit for the blind, which has since been
closed, said museum spokeswoman Molly Stockdale.
   New security measures were installed and armed campus officers
now patrol the museum at night, she said.
   Lowenthal said a ``very disturbing'' trend also has been for more
violent robberies.
   On Nov. 23, an armed man took a 12-inch bronze head from the
Rodin Museum after handcuffing the unarmed guards. The piece, ``Mask
of the Man With the Broken Nose,'' is valued at more than $75,000.
   Leon J. Perelman, 77, operated the Perelman Toy Museum in
Philadelphia until a robbery in August in which a caretaker was
bound and held at gunpoint by two men. The only items taken in the
robbery were marbles.
   ``I think in my own particular case I had very valuable items
that were worth 10 times the items stolen,'' he said. ``Whoever was
behind this was a collector of marbles. ... This was the kind of
thing (the robbers) were getting for somebody.''
   Perelman closed the museum after the robbery and has sold the
remaining pieces.
   He said unscrupulous art collectors may hire someone to take
selected pieces, which then are hidden for the collector's private
enjoyment.
   ``There are individual collectors who are so obsessed with the
fact they have to own certain things,'' Perelman said.
   Despite the increase in prices for art _ a painting by Pablo
Picasso recently sold in London for $38.5 million _ profit isn't
considered by many to be what prompts thefts.
   ``It's very difficult ... to market an item once it's been
stolen,'' said Ed Able, executive director of the American Museum
Association in Washington.
   After an item is reported stolen, the publicity usually prevents
the robber from selling it openly and receiving a large sum of money.

<HEAD>HHS Chief Says Bush Administration Must Walk `Tight Line' on Health
Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outgoing Health and Human Services
secretary says the Bush administration will have to ``walk a very
tight line'' to avoid cutting the quality of health care in trying
to curb soaring Medicare expenses.
   Dr. Otis R. Bowen said that with a federal budget out of balance,
Medicare cannot escape close scrutiny simply because it is one of
the nation's largest budget items and one of the fastest growing,
particularly the 15 percent annual inflation rate in physician
payments.
   ``At the same time we have to walk a very tight line and make
sure we are not reducing the quality of care and access to care,''
he said in an interview last week. ``It is my judgment that we're
getting close to that level now and we have to be very cautious
about going too deep.''
   Bowen declined to discuss specifics of the final budget the
Reagan administration will submit next month.
   However, department officials have acknowledged previously that
they have agreed to about $6 billion in net reductions in projected
Medicare outlays, mostly by holding down payments to doctors and
hospitals.
   No reductions are proposed in benefits for the 32 million elderly
and disabled Americans served by Medicare, nor does the budget
envision increased charges to beneficiaries.
   Looking beyond the restraints he has agreed to for the next
budget, Bowen said, ``We are getting close to the time where further
ratcheting down could cause some deterioration in the quality of
care and perhaps even access to care.''
   ``The next secretary and the next administration are going to
have some difficult battles with the health care providers and also
maybe even with the senior citizens who are being impacted by it,''
he said.
   ``One of the reasons it's going to be tougher is because of the
massive new numbers of old people that we have coming along,'' said
Bowen, who will be 71 in February.
   He cited statistics projecting that the number of people over 100
years of age will grow from 25,000 to 100,000 in just over a decade.
   Not only will they require more medical attention because of such
an advanced age, Bowen said, those living longer will have used up
their savings and ``might become a bigger burden'' on public
assistance.
   Bowen, a former two-term governor of Indiana who long ago
expressed his desire to return to his home state for a quiet
retirement, said in a wide-ranging interview that his greatest sense
of accomplishment was passage of the catastrophic protection
addition to Medicare that takes effect in January.
   ``Getting the president's approval over the objections of so many
in the Cabinet, that was the tough part,'' said Bowen. ``Once the
president gave his approval, then it became a lot easier to try to
contain the number of additions Congress wanted to add to it.''
   His greatest disappointment, he said, was that the states have
moved too slowly to address medical malpractice insurance problems
that Bowen said could be threatening access to health care in some
regions.
   He said he is not certain the Bush administration should propose
federal legislation to supplant the state's traditional control of
insurance during its first year, ``but I think it's certainly time
to begin talking about it and decide what the parameters of such
legislation should be.''
   On AIDS, he said there still needs to be special emphasis on the
epidemic by federal health officers ``because of the emotional
response of the people. People are scared to death.''
   ``I hesitate to single it out as a disease to be treated
differently from others, but I think as yet it does need to have a
little extra special treatment,'' he said.
   Bowen said he has not been consulted by Bush transition officials
for a recommendation on who should succeed him. But he said he hopes
the incoming president will not view the appointment as a minor one.
   ``When you're talking about a kinder and gentler America, you're
talking about HHS,'' he said of the huge agency that has a larger
budget than the Pentagon and embraces such programs as Social
Security, Medicare and welfare.
   The department also includes the sprawling Public Health Service
umbrella that covers such well-known agencies as the Food and Drug
Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers
for Disease Control.

   Customs agents at Heathrow Airport detained the
daughter of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and took an expensive
watch from her because there was no proof it was not an illegal
import, The Mail on Sunday reported.
   The weekly said Carol Thatcher, 35, was questioned for 15 minutes
about the watch when she returned Nov. 27 from an assignment in
Pakistan.
   The watch was valued at $2,760 and when she reclaimed it several
days later she had to pay $185 import duty and a tax of $27, the
report said.
   An unidentified spokesman for Miss Thatcher was quoted as saying:
``She was given the watch in this country and has worn it while
coming in and out of Britain on several occasions.''

   A Soviet emergency relief plane carrying soldiers
to Armenia crashed Sunday, killing 78 people and compounding the
tragedy in the earthquake-ravaged republic.
   The crash marred an unprecedented airlift of rescuers, doctors
and disaster equipment that began pouring into northern Armenia from
around the world after Wednesday's earthquake.
   The official news agency Tass said an Ilyushin-76 military
transport plane went down as it was approaching the airport just
outside Leninakan, Armenia's second-largest city which suffered
massive destruction in the quake.
   The plane was carrying soliders to help victims of the quake,
which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and killed at least 40,000
people, Tass said.
   Nine crew members and 69 soldiers were killed aboard the
wide-body plane, the report said. It earlier gave a figure of 70
soldiers killed but then revised it. There was no word on the total
number of passengers, the time of the accident or where the flight
originated.
   ``With a feeling of grief and compassion we express profound
condolences to the relatives and dear ones of the killed, who
hurried to help the fraternal Armenian people and earned the eternal
gratitude of the Soviet people,'' the Communist Party and government
said in a message of condolence carried by Tass.
   Associated Press reporter Mark J. Porubcansky flew into the
Leninakan airport aboard a helicopter before the crash was reported
and said there was little air traffic. He said that in the morning
there was a little haze but otherwise the weather was good.
   By afternoon, Porubcansky said, low clouds had developed along
with rain and strong cold winds. He did not witness the crash.
   Krasnaya Zvezda, the Red Army daily, reported Sunday that bad
weather was complicating the military airlift. But the Soviet
Meteorological Center in Moscow said no weather problems were likely
to have contributed to the crash.
   The Leninakan airport was reportedly heavily damaged by the quake
but was put into service quickly to take in relief supplies and
evacuate some of the 12,000 wounded.
   The Soviet press has reported that 300 large military transport
planes including the Ilyushin-76 were flying in Armenia as part of
the rescue operation day and night.
   The planes have been used to fly in badly needed heavy cranes and
excavators to lift the huge concrete slabs and other rubble trapping
survivors in buildings crumbled by the quake.
   There was no word on whether the Ilyushin-76 was carrying rescue
equipment in addition to the soldiers.
   Jane's All the World's Aircraft, a British reference book, says
the Ilyushin-76 is designed to land on short airstrips under
difficult weather conditions. It says the plane, which went into
service in 1971, has four-turbofan engines and can carry 40 tons of
freight.
   In addition to the Soviet planes, aircraft from around the world
have been arriving in Armenia with disaster relief equipment and
personnel.

<DATELINE>OLOMOUC, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 people demonstrated
peacefully Sunday in this city to demand the release of a leading
religious activist who has been confined to a psychiatric hospital
since October.
   Czechoslovak police arrested one of the organizers but did not
otherwise interfere with the 20-minute protest in a downtown square.
   The demonstrators, who prayed and sang religious songs, demanded
that Augustin Navratil be released from the hospital, located
several miles outside of Olomouc in central Czechoslovakia. Earlier
this year, he launched a petition drive calling for more religious
freedom in his country.
   Navratil, 60, who is widely known in Czechoslovakia and has
repeatedly been interrogated and detained in the past six years, was
confined in the hospital Oct. 28. His petition was signed by 600,000
Czechoslovaks around the country.
   Before the demonstrators met in the Peace Square near the City
Hall and the Monument to the Holy Trinity, a Catholic nun who was
praying on the site was taken by force by plainclothes police into
the hall.
   During the gathering, the demonstrators prayed and circled the
monument, carrying crosses that they kept raised in their hands.
   After a woman's voice speaking through a loudspeaker from the
direction of the City Hall asked the people to ``go back home,''
several plainclothes policemen grabbed a demonstrator, dragged him
to a car and sped off.
   Sources among the demonstrators identified the youth as Michal
Mrtvy, an organizer of the rally. Mrtvy's wife told reporters she
did not know why her husband was taken away but said that three
years ago he was arrested for having distributed religious
literature.
   The sources, who demanded anonymity, said two other organizers,
identified as Pavel Zalesky and Tomas Kopriva, were arrested earlier
this week and have been kept in police custody ever since.
   Another man, who identified himself as Radomir Maly, told
reporters that he was shortly detained on Friday, when police
ordered him not to go to Prague and attend a human rights meeting
there on Saturday.
   Maly said he visited Navratil recently and found him fine. ``He
is free to walk in the hospital and he appears to be well treated,''
Maly told reporters.
   However, Maly said he did not know when Navratil would be
released.
   Thousands of people gathered in Prague on Saturday to demand more
freedom and human rights in Czechoslovakia at the first independent
rally permitted by the communist authorities in nearly 20 years.
   They originally planned the rally, called to mark the 40th
anniversary of ther 1948 Declaration of Human Rights, for Prague's
historic Wenceslas Square.
   Authorities banned the gathering in the city center, but
unexpectedly offered an alternative site about a mile away.

   Nude ``angels'' coaxing lonely men to donate
money to the Church of Love and promising a retirement paradise
called Chonda-Za are the heart of a sensational fraud case being
tried in federal court.
   Prosecutors say the ``church'' was the front for a mail-order
sex-fantasy scam that exchanged pictures of nude women and phony
letters for contributions to a non-existent church paradise.
   The government says 31,000 men in nearly every state were bilked
out of $4.5 million in the alleged scheme based in Moline.
   The case revolves around a former English teacher, Donald S.
Lowry, 59, who founded the Church of Love in 1965, and his
assistant, Pamala St. Charles, 25.
   Both face multiple charges of mail fraud, conspiracy and unlawful
use of fraud proceeds. If convicted of fraud, Lowry could face 130
years in prison and fines of $6.5 million. Ms. St. Charles faces a
possible sentence of 65 years in prison and $2.5 million in fines.
   Former church members have testified for both sides.
   Raymond Wisman, 76, of Montpelier, Ohio, said he believed Lowry's
stories and planned to retire to Chonda-Za and live with the angels.
   ``I was lonesome and I had figured that this was real instead of
phony,'' Wisman said.
   Carl Cornell, 83, of De Queen, Ark., said he learned the angels
were fiction a year after joining the church in 1981.
   ``As long as I've lived, I've been like a fish who bit the hook
and got caught,'' Cornell said. ``I didn't care if they were real.
The letters were entertaining. They're nice letters and they make a
man feel good.''
   Lowry, testifying last week, compared himself to Santa Claus
fulfilling mens' dreams.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney K. Tate Chambers describes Lowry as the
mastermind who created the paradise idea, wrote all the letters from
the ``love angels'' to church members, solicited models he passed
off as angels to pose nude for photographs members paid for, and
then lined his pockets with the contributions.
   ``This isn't a case about dirty pictures, sex or obscenity,''
Chambers said. ``It's about fraud.''
   At issue is the elaborate myth Lowry says he spun to provide a
healthy fantasy for his church members. He says it was an innocent
fantasy which church members participated in willingly and knew was
not real.
   ``It was a very pure, wholesome and decent fantasy,'' testified
Lowry, of Bettendorf, Iowa. ``This is based on the principle that
the illusion of romance is better than no romance at all.''
   The phony letters from ``love angels'' boosted the confidence of
the lonely men who responded with their own letters and
contributions, Lowry said.
   The government says the contributions were used to pay Lowry and
his wife, Esther, salaries exceeding $100,000 a year for four years,
and that the church corporation also bought a fleet of expensive
cars.
   Lowry admitted in court last week he paid $100 to $150 for sexual
favors from the women who modeled as love angels. He said he even
gave one woman clothing, a car and furniture and paid her rent, but
contended that was not related to sexual acts.
   The Church of Love folded in 1987 and Lowry organized a new
group, called the International Order of Knights, consisting mainly
of former church members.
   Lowry even put $5,000 down earlier this year on 84 acres near New
Philadelphia, Ohio, where he planned to build a retreat for his
knights.
   The trial was to resume Monday with testimony from Ms. St.
Charles.

   A Washington nudist group, which presumably
doesn't need them, is donating a truckload of clothes to help with
earthquake relief in Soviet Armenia.
   The group, the Potomac Rambling Bares, charged a grocery bag full
of clothing as admission to its annual Christmas@Hannukah
party Saturday night, and collected an overflowing pickup-truck
load, said spokesman Gary Brown.
   He said the group had contacted two local Armenian churches to
offer the clothing to victims of last week's massive earthquake that
left at least 40,000 dead and hundreds of thousands homeless.
   ``We're always looking for ways to get nudist clubs involved in
community things,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   South Florida residents willing to pay extra for a
feeling of security have taken crime and traffic problems into their
own hands, blocking off public streets with barricades and posting
guardhouses.
   A guardhouse is going up in the Andover area in Dade County,
barricades are in place in suburban Miami Shores, roving patrols
operate in the Hammock Oaks subdivision, and a dozen road barriers
have been placed in Fort Lauderdale's Riverside section. Residents
often voluntarily raise taxes for such measures.
   The barricades, a response to muggings, purse snatchings and
break-ins, have been adopted primarily by older, well-to-do
neighborhoods bordered by less affluent areas or commercial strips.
   ``The disturbing fact of this, I suppose, in the worst-case
scenario there's the medieval idea of a walled city,'' said William
Tilson, an associate professor of architecture who specializes in
urban design at the University of Florida. ``It's kind of ironic in
a society that seems to be so concerned about information and
networks that we're often myopic in other actions.''
   Street barriers have been adopted by communities across the
nation as buffers against crime, in St. Louis for example, and to
encourage bicycle and pedestrian traffic, such as those in Davis,
Calif.
   Barricades ``are a response to a crime condition that's gotten
out of hand,'' Tilson said. ``They're seen as perhaps the most
economical or the most expedient ways of dealing with a problem that
presents itself immediately.''
   The prestigious Palm, Hibiscus and Star islands in Biscayne Bay
have opted for guardhouses, where the license plate numbers of
visitors are copied down.
   Miami Shores blocked 18 intersections with barrels and stop signs
in June and has seen a 17 percent reduction in crime for the village
as a whole and 20 percent in the barricaded zones, said Mayor Spero
Canton.
   The village of 9,600 people north of downtown Miami ranges from
lower middle-class homes to affluent country club homes and bayside
villas.
   ``We live about a half-mile from some pretty tough areas of Dade
County, so it seems that when these crack addicts or drug users look
for money, they look to a neighborhood with money,'' Canton said.
   Attorney Peter Kircher, a Miami Shores resident on a committee
opposed to barricades, considers them ludicrous and the expense
``utter stupidity.''
   ``It started out as a partial solution to a problem and then it
became a solution to everything,'' he said. ``Increasing property
values. Decreasing traffic. Crime. Name the problem, we will solve
it with barricades.''
   Kircher has urged his village council to remove the barricades,
but council members have refused, saying residents have a right to
block off their streets to discourage criminals from cruising their
neighborhoods.
   In unincorported Dade County, five special taxing districts have
been formed and four applications are pending from residents willing
to pay extra property taxes for street closings, guard gates and
extra patrols.
   The Andover area, where streets are lined by royal palms and
property values range from $125,000 to $300,000, will open its
guardhouse Jan. 1. About 475 residents will pay $380 each next year
and $150-$175 a year afterward for their new district.
   ``We're not foolish enough to believe it's going to be a panacea
of all our ills,'' said Don Grate, a retired schoolteacher and
president of the Andover Civic Association. ``We think the value of
property will go up knowing you have more security. People like to
feel they have some semblance of security.''
   Fort Lauderdale Mayor Robert Cox said, ``The perception of safety
is almost as important as the safety itself.''
   ``What do you have when you've barricaded off all the good
areas?'' asked Hubert Williams, president of the Washington-based
Police Foundation think tank. ``If the sense of community is
predicated on class discrimination, that kind of thing would be
diametrically opposed to our highest democratic principles.''
   He also mentioned concern for the right to use public
thoroughfares.
   William Wilbanks, a criminal justice professor at Miami's Florida
International University, said that such security measure will
``displace crime in areas that are not too well protected. That will
probably mean poorer communities.''

<HEAD>Nine Jewish Leaders Resign In Wake of Holocaust Funds Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine members of the German Jewish Council's
executive board resigned Sunday in the wake of an embezzlement
scandal earlier this year involving funds for Holocaust victims,
said the leader of the council.
   Heinz Galinski said the nine resigned because ``they no longer
enjoyed the confidence of their colleagues and local (Jewish)
councils.''
   He said the resignations were linked to the discovery earlier
this year of irregularities in funds earmarked to assist victims of
Nazi persecution.
   The council's former president, the late Werner Nachmann, was
suspected of illegally channeling nearly $17.2 million in interest
from the funds to prop up his financially struggling businesses over
a seven-year period.
   Members of the executive board, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the nine had been blamed for not properly overseeing
Nachmann's handling of the council's financial affairs.
   Galinski said the council is continuing to investigate the
affair, which he said ``remains a heavy weight on all of us.''

<TEXT>
   Rain fell over much of the Southeast on Sunday, light snow was
scattered over the center of the nation, and up to 14 inches of snow
accumulated near the lower Great Lakes.
   Low pressure over the north-central Gulf of Mexico generated the
rain over the Southeast, with showers extending from the lower
Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Showers and thunderstorms, some of them strong, produced locally
heavy rain in northern Florida.
   In the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, Apalachicola, Fla., got 0.98
of an inch of rain.
   Snow and sleet extended over parts of Arkansas and northern
Mississippi and were expected to spread into northern Alabama.
   Rain over South Carolina also was expected to change to sleet and
snow as cold air flowed in, and a winter storm warning was issued
for the mountains of South Carolina.
   Squalls produced snow around the lower Great Lakes through the
morning. In 24 hours, 14 inches of snow accumulated at the western
New York state town of Sodus and Sherman, N.Y., received 12 inches.
   A weak storm system produced light snow in the central part of
the nation including parts of South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas
and Nebraska. Little Sioux, Neb., had 4 inches of snow by early
afternoon.
   Fog and drizzle spread over much of the West.
   By early afternoon, temperatures remained below freezing from the
northern and central Plains to the middle and northern Atlantic
Coast. Temperatures were only in the single digits or below zero in
Minnesota, eastern North Dakota, northeastern South Dakota, northern
Iowa, northwestern Wisconsin, Upper Michigan, northern Lower
Michigan, upstate New York and northern New England.
   Readings were in the 70s and 80s across southern and central
Florida and in the 60s and 70s in southern California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 2
degrees below zero at Limestone, Maine, to 82 at Vero Beach and West
Palm Beach, Fla. Sunday morning's official low was 25 degrees below
zero at International Falls, Minn.
   For Monday, rain was forecast from Louisiana to the southern
Atlantic Coast, changing to snow from northern Alabama to the
southern Appalachians. Light snow or snow showers were forecast over
the upper half of the Mississippi Valley and western sections of the
Great Lakes. Showers were forecast in the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs remaining below freezing were predicted from the middle and
upper Mississippi Valley to the middle and northern Atlantic Coast,
including below 20 degrees from northeastern Minnesota to the
northern Atlantic Coast, and in the single digits across northern
New England and upstate New York; above 50 from the Pacific Coast
through much of Arizona and New Mexico to the Texas coast and across
southern Georgia and northern Georgia, including highs in the 60s
and 70s in southern California and southern Arizona, in the 60s
across central Florida, and in the 70s in southern Florida.

   The blast occurred at about 3 p.m. as the soldiers were
patrolling the village of Zabqine, five miles north of the
Israeli-Labanese border, said Timor Goksel, spokesman for the U.N.
peacekeeping forces.
   He said one soldier suffered moderate injuries and the other two
were slightly wounded. All three were flown to a U.N.-run hospital
in Naqoura near the Israeli border.
   ``It's a very heavily mined area and it always has been,'' Goksel
said. ``We had to clear a trail through the mines to take them out.''
   The nine-nation, 5,800-man United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon was deployed in 1978 and since then, 156 of its soldiers
have been killed and 230 wounded.

   Students in this century-old community gave the
first dance ever allowed in their public schools the highest mark of
teen-age approval: ``awesome.''
   But the weekend success was no guarantee of future school dances
in the Ozarks town of 900, where a federal judge had to step in to
open the way for Saturday's homecoming gala.
   Student council president Nancy Fox, appearing tired but happy
after a day that included a college entrance exam and the historic
dance, said early Sunday that she wasn't ready to plan another dance.
   ``I'm still thinking about clean-up for this one,'' she said.
   Students were shy about taking the floor when the dance began but
Miss Fox said she reminded them of the attention the dance
controversy had received around the country.
   ``They say we can't dance,'' Miss Fox told her schoolmates.
   After that, the floor was crowded for the rest of the evening,
she said.
   Sheldon Buxton, superintendent of the Purdy school system, said
about 85 students attended the dance. He said it went smoothly, but
refused to comment on whether other dances could be expected.
   Long-time residents say Purdy has never been without a ban on
social dancing in the schools. But U.S. District Judge Russell Clark
ruled this summer that the school board's written policy against
dancing unconstitutionally promoted the values of those who oppose
dancing for religious reasons.
   The four-member school board appealed Clark's order that they
stop enforcing the ban, but a federal appeals court allowed the
dance to go on while it considers the issue. The 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals is not expected to rule in the case before next
year.
   School board members ``have been saying all around town that they
(students) might have this one, but they won't have another one,''
said Joan Fox, who has been a spokeswoman for the 21 Purdy students
and parents who sued the school board over the dance ban. Mrs. Fox
is Nancy Fox's mother.
   School board members refused to comment on the case.
   Nancy Fox said board members attended the dance, which was barred
to all but the 161 students currently attending Purdy High School.
But the board members, who sat on the sidelines during the dance
talking among themselves, apparently did not cramp students' style.
   ``It was a blast, we had a great time,'' Miss Fox said.
   ``It was really fun, everybody's dancing,'' said Shannon
Francisco, a Purdy senior who left the dance ahead of the main crowd.
   But Miss Francisco, 17, added that the dance had caused
controversy and bitterness in the small town.
   ``I don't think it was worth all that,'' she said.
   Crowds of students leaving the dance, which began about 10:15
p.m. Saturday and ended at midnight, answered with choruses of
``awesome'' when asked about their evening.
   Reporters and photographers were not allowed into the small
gymnasium during the dance, but loud rock music, shouts and claps
could be heard throughout the dance.
   Students, most dressed casually in jeans and sweaters, went to
the dance in the elementary school gymnasium immediately after
watching their varsity basketball team lose a 61-56 game to Billings
High School in the larger high school gymnasium. Purdy's elementary
and high schools are within the same complex.

   Deposed Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
remained in guarded but stable condition on Sunday, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Beyond the brief condition report, ``the physicians won't be
talking again this weekend. They'll have a statement at noon
Monday,'' said St. Francis Medical Center nursing supervisor Elsie
Katano.
   Aides say Marcos, 71, experienced congestive heart failure Friday
after learning his eldest daughter, Imee Manotoc, was experiencing
complications during childbirth in Morocco, where she lives.
   The Philippines consul general in Hawaii, Thomas Gomez, says he
thinks Marcos is faking illness to avoid arraignment in federal
court in New York on federal racketeering charges, which allege he
plundered millions of dollars from the Philippine treasury.
   A New York cardiologist who examined Marcos last month for a
federal judge in New York reported that although Marcos suffers
various ailments, he is well enough to travel.
   Imelda Marcos angrily denied charges that her husband is faking.
   ``I'm fighting for the survival of my husband,'' she told
reporters.
   Hospital officials on Saturday quoted Dr. Calvin Wong, the
cardiologist attending Marcos, as saying tests confirmed that Marcos
had ``weakened heart muscles.'' Wong could not be reached to
elaborate.

   A 42-member Israeli rescue team headed by an
army general left Sunday in an air force jet for Yerevan in Soviet
Armenia to help search for earthquake survivors.
   An army spokesman said two other planes would leave for the
Soviet Union on Monday with a 46-member medical team, equipment and
4{ tons of medical supplies for victims of Wednesday's quake that
killed tens of thousands of people.
   The relief effort marked the second time this month that Israel
has rendered humanitarian assistance to the Soviets which broke
diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967 when Israel captured Arab
lands.
   ``We have no intention of building political achievements on such
tragic events,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Allon Liel said in a
telephone interview. ``I must state, though, that the atmosphere
created following this and the hijack incident last week, is a warm
and friendly one.''
   On Dec. 2, four people hijacked a cargo plane in the Soviet Union
and forced the crew to fly them to Israel. After a series of unusual
diplomatic contacts between the two countries, Israel allowed Soviet
authorities to come to Tel Aviv to claim the plane and the hijackers.
   The relief team is headed by Gen. Aharon Vardi who is in charge
of the army's civil defense unit. Traveling with him are specially
trained experts in operating heavy cranes, several doctors, and an
Alsatian shepherd named Tim, who is trained to sniff people under
rubble and wore a red Star of David on a white chest cloth.
   Vardi said the group had enough camping equipment to remain up to
three weeks, if the Soviets are able to provide them with enough
trucks, gas and water.
   In Jerusalem, hundreds of grieving Armenians wearing black
armbands and veils marched in silence through the streets of
Jerusalem's Old City on Sunday to mourn the earthquake victims.
   Also at the demonstration were Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek and
Natan Sharansky, a former Soviet prisoner and human rights activist.
   Many wept at St. James Cathedral during a candlelight prayer
service presided over by Archbishop Karekin Kazandjian of
Jerusalem's 2,000 member Armenian church.

   Authorities imposed tight security in the Tibetan
capital and searched foreigners' hotel rooms Sunday, a day after
police fired on independence activists in a central square, Western
travelers said.
   China said Sunday that a Buddhist monk was killed and 13 people
were wounded when police fired into a crowd during the demonstration
in Lhasa. Western travelers said they believed two people were
killed, and another foreign traveler said a Tibetan reported seeing
four bodies at a hospital.
   It was not immediately possible to reconcile the casualty figures.
   The clash on Saturday was the third bloody confrontation in the
remote region between authorities and anti-Chinese protesters since
October 1987.
   Tourists said Chinese police were looking for foreigners caught
in the protest near the Jokhang Temple, one of the holiest sites of
Tibetan Buddhism.
   A Dutch woman wounded in the left shoulder reported ``complete
panic'' after the shooting began.
   ``Everybody started running. I heard the bullets skimming past my
head _ shoo, shoo,'' said Christa Meindersma, of Amsterdam, in a
telephone interview from her hotel room in Lhasa.
   ``I felt a sting in my arm, but I didn't realize it was a
bullet,'' said Ms. Meindersma. ``The soldiers were running after us.
I ran into a Tibetan courtyard and I said, `I'm wounded,' and I
fainted.''
   Ms. Meindersma, who said she had been in Lhasa since September
studying Tibetan, said she refused to stay in a hospital where she
was treated because police wanted to question her and take her
picture. She said police also searched her hotel room.
   She said police searched the rooms of other foreign tourists.
   A large group of Tibetans prayed on Sunday near scattered pools
of blood left from Saturday's clash in the city's central
markeplace, said a Frenchman reached by telephone in Lhasa.
   ``They placed candles and little white tissues on the blood in
the same way they do for the Buddhas in their temples,'' said the
26-year-old Frenchman, who identified himself only as Thierry.
   He said there was no new violence by midday Sunday, when about
1,000 police drove through the city and others patrolled the market
on foot. He said soldiers with guns also stood guard from rooftops
overlooking the market.
   A traveler speaking on condition of anonymity said by telephone
from Lhasa that a Tibetan who went to the hospital to give blood for
the wounded saw four bodies.
   On Sunday, activists were distributing leaflets in Tibetan and
English calling for an end to Chinese rule over Tibet, the Frenchman
said.
   Two witnesses to Saturday's events said Buddhist monks told them
there would be another demonstration Sunday, but later efforts to
reach the remote region by phone and telex were unsuccessful.
   The clash Saturday began when 30 Tibetans, identified by the
Xinhua News Agency as monks and nuns, marched into the market
carrying the banned Tibetan flag to commemorate the 40th anniversary
of the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights. The protesters, dressed in
street clothes and face masks, demanded an end to 38 years of
Chinese communist rule over the Himalayan region.
   The nationally televised evening news said police ``were forced
to fire'' during Saturday's unrest when ``some troublemakers refused
to heed a warning and threw stones and bottles at police.''
   The official Xinhua News Agency said that of the 13 injured, two
were seriously hurt. It gave no details and did not say if they were
demonstrators.
   Another Dutch woman who witnessed the clash, Lucia Dezries, said
a crowd of Tibetans surged toward the demonstrators and began
stoning the security forces, who opened fire. She said it was not
clear whether the stone-throwing or shooting began first.
   Ms. Dezries said she saw two people lying in pools of blood and
was told they were dead.
   The Chinese government claims Tibet has been part of China since
the 13th century. Many Tibetans, however, say they were independent
during most of that time and were ruled by a Buddhist theocracy
headed by the Dalai Lama, who had both civil and religious authority.
   Chinese communist troops moved into Tibet in 1950 and put down an
uprising nine years later during which the Dalai Lama fled to India.

<TEXT>
   A Turkish soldier was in critical
condition Sunday after a Greek Cypriot trooper shot him in the
U.N.-patrolled zone that divides the capital of this Mediterranean
island, a U.N. spokesman said.
   The soldier, identified as Hassan Kara, underwent surgery for a
bullet wound in the stomach after the 3:15 p.m. incident at the
crossing point between the Greek and Turkish sectors of the capital,
said Charles Gaulkin, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping forces.
   The Turkish soldier was shot once when he crossed toward the
Greek area of the buffer zone after refusing to respond to a halt
order, said a Greek Cypriot officer of the National Guard, speaking
on conditon of anonymity. The National Guard said in a statement
that the Turk ignored four shots fired in the air.
   The National Guard said the soldier crawled out of the buffer
zone and a U.N. ambulance took him to a hospital on the
Turkish-controlled northern side of the island.
   Police in the Turkish part of Cyprus said the soldier was on
regular patrol when the Greek soldier shot at him eight times.
   Cyprus Defense Minister Andreas Aloneftis said, ``We have
established that the Greek Cypriot soldier did nothing more than
what they are required to do in case of a violation of the buffer
zone.''
   Tension has been mounting in the 100-yard-wide zone of the old
walled city after four fatal shootings in 1988. The area is
patrolled by Greek Cypriot soldiers who face Turkish Cypriot troops
and mainland Turkish soldiers across trenches fortified with
sandbags.
   Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded in 1974. In August,
U.N.-sponsored peace talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides resumed after a break of nearly three years.

<HEAD>No Room for Secret Service on Bush's Quail Hunt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEEVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Things are not quite the same this year
for President-elect George Bush's Christmas quail hunting trip.
   When the Secret Service attempted to book hotel rooms for the
three-day trip, they found no room at the inns.
   For the past 20 years, Bush has hunted quail at Will Farrish's
10,000-acre Lazy F Ranch. Beeville, about 15 miles south, is the
largest town in the ranching area, 65 miles northwest of Corpus
Christi.
   Farrish is a close friend of Bush's and also manages the
president-elect's investments through a blind trust.
   Members of the national news media began planning for the trip
several weeks ago and booked most of the 88 hotel rooms in Beeville.
   Floyd Lee of the Secret Service office in Corpus Christi, said,
``We'll just have to go to other cities'' for rooms when Bush
arrives Dec. 26.
   ``I had Secret Service call me and ask for 60 rooms, and I just
had to say I was sorry,'' Evelyn Bloys, manager of Beeville's
largest hotel, the 59-room Best Western Drummers Inn, said last week.
   Bloys suggested the Secret Service could use a recently closed
motel, but it has been stripped of its light fixtures, carpeting and
furniture. Another suggestion was to rent dorm rooms at Bee County
College.
   ``We've never done it before,'' college spokesman Joe Cowan said.
``I'm sure if they asked, we'd work it out.''

   An explosion set off a fire in a major market
Sunday, apparently in fireworks stands set up for the holidays, and
initial reports said at least 15 people were injured, the Red Cross
and fire department said.
   ``Powder in the fireworks exploded and the fire extended to a
building,'' said Vicente Renero, on duty at the fire department.
``It appears there are quite a few injured.''
   He said the fire in the Merced market was reported at 2:40 p.m.
   Jose Pinajero of the Red Cross said 15 people suffered burns but
none of them seriously enough to endanger their lives.
   He said a series of explosions were believed to have occurred in
the fireworks stands, but the report was not yet confirmed.
   For years, the Merced was the main market in this city of 18
million, supplying dozens of other markets and individual customers.
A a new main market was built on the edge of the city, but the
Merced remains important because of tradition and its more
convenient location.
   Fireworks merchants set up stands in the area for holidays, such
as Independence Day in September and Christmas and New Year's.

   Palestinians protesting the killing of two
youths shut down the Gaza Strip in a general strike Sunday, and
hospital officials said Israeli troops wounded 20 people in clashes.
   In mainly Arab east Jerusalem, police sprayed tear gas at a
junior high school for girls to disperse stone-throwing
demonstrators, sending about two dozen female pupils fleeing down
the street, witnesses said.
   Seven girls, all aged 14 and 15, were treated briefly for beating
injuries and two for inhaling tear gas after the incident at the Al
Rawda school, an official at nearby Mukassed Hospital said.
   Underground Palestinian leaders had designated Sunday as a day
for ``unique escalation'' of the struggle against Israel to mark 20
years since the founding of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In Gaza, soldiers imposed curfews on seven refugee camps and
neighborhoods, keeping 115,000 Palestinians indoors, Arab news
reports said. On Saturday the entire Gaza Strip with its population
of 650,000 was under curfew.
   Moslem fundamentalists of the ``Hamas'' or Zeal movement forced
merchants to shut down for the day in the main Gaza towns of Gaza
City and Khan Yunis by stoning taxis and Arab vehicles taking
Palestinians to work, Arab reports said.
   Hamas leaders were quoted as saying the strike was called to
protest two deaths Saturday _ a 16-year-old shot by troops as he
threw a firebomb at an army patrol in Gaza City, and a 20-year-old
who was shot as he tried to stab a guard at Gaza's Shati prison.
   The deaths raised to 322 the number of Palestinians killed in the
year-long rebellion against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Eleven Israelis also have died.
   During the strike, stone-throwing protests broke out in two Gaza
City neighborhoods and the Shati refugee camp, and some
demonstrators unfurled outlawed Palestinian flags, Arab news reports
said.
   Troops opened fire, wounding an 18-year-old in the chest in Gaza
and a 17-year-old in the back in Khan Yunis, hospital officials said.
   Soldiers shot three other Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,
including a 46-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man who was shot 5
times in the left hand.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   The national Itim news agency said three soldiers suffered slight
to moderate injuries when they were struck by stones.
   Fifteen Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds during clashes with
soldiers in the West Bank cities of Ramallah, Tulkarem and Nablus,
several refugee camps near Nablus and the nearby village of Tel,
said officials at Al Ittihad and St. Luke hospitals. The army said
it was checking those reports as well.
   In east Jerusalem, police confronted stone and bottle-throwing
protesters who chanted PLO slogans and blocked roads with boulders
in three neighborhoods. Three Arabs were arrested, said Jerusalem
Police spokesman Rafi Levy. He declined to elaborate. The national
Itim news agency said five were arrested.
   Also Sunday, Bedouin Arabs from the northern Israeli village of
Ibtin launched a three-day general strike to mourn the burning of
their mosque Friday night. Police suspect the fire was the work of
Jewish extremists retaliating for a summer grenade attack in the
city of Haifa in which an Israeli boy lost a foot and 24 others were
wounded, news reports said.
   Ten of the 13 suspects in the Haifa attack are from Ibtin.

<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Quake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, standing in the
rubble in the earthquake-ruined city of Spitak, told rescue workers
Sunday they must race to bury the dead before an epidemic strikes
and takes more lives.
   In 20 minutes of remarks shown to the nation on the television
evening news, Gorbachev also promised Armenians an investigation
into why new buildings collapsed in Wednesday's quake while older
structures remained standing.
   He said that once the rescue and cleanup are completed, a
government commission will look into that question.
   ``Why did buildings from three years ago collapse while those
built with three or five stories under (former Soviet Premier Nikita
S.) Khrushchev are still standing?'' he said in an angry tone.
   Soviet buildings are notoriously poorly constructed, but the
public admission of this by a top Soviet official is rare.
   In an emotional exchange, a man in the crowd that surrounded
Gorbachev on a Spitak street demanded to know why scientists did not
predicted the earthquake, which has killed at least 40,000 people
according to official estimates.
   ``We also are making such demands,'' the Soviet leader told the
man. But he added, ``So far, nowhere in the world do they have
methods to predict'' earthquakes.
   He said Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov had advised him that
the weather conditions in the disaster area would create a threat of
an epidemic seven days after the earthquake. Bodies buried under the
rubble must be removed to avoid an outbreak, he said.
   Gorbachev told the rescuers that doctors and health officials
have devised emergency measures in case an epidemic strikes. He did
not elaborate.
   The Kremlin chief did not specify what kind of epidemic might
break out. But destruction of urban water supplies and pollution
from decaying corpses can spread deadly diseases such as typhoid and
dysentery.
   Later on the broadcast, Gorbachev spoke in the Armenian capital
of Yerevan with a Soviet television correspondent who asked about
the dispute between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the
Nagorno-Karabakh district of Azerbaijan. Armenians have been
pressing for the annexation of the region, most of whose people are
ethnic Armenians.
   Gorbachev, raising his hands for emphasis and speaking in an
angry tone, accused ``provocateurs'' pushing for control of
Nagorno-Karabakh of using the tragic consequences of the earthquake
to create instability.
   He said some activists accused authorities of planning to take
children orphaned in the earthquake out of Armenia. Gorbachev
angrily denied this was planned and said: ``What kind of morals do
those people have?''
   ``They don't need Karabakh. They are waging a battle for power,
and they must be stopped,'' he said.
   Gorbachev and the rest of the leadership have rejected the
annexation demand. The dispute between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
over the issue has led to violence that has killed about 60 people.
   In the interview, Gorbachev praised the outpouring of assistance
from throughout the Soviet Union for earthquake victims.
   ``We are proud of all our people,'' he said. ``What immense moral
strength they have!''
   The priority in the rescue now, he said, is to save people still
trapped under the piles of crumbled concrete.
   ``First and foremost we must help to clear these piles of rubble,
where there are still many people alive. Because people are being
freed there every day. I have met some of them. So the first task,
the first thing being done, is to save those who are still alive.
   ``Those who have perished must also be got out as befits human
beings, given a funeral,'' Gorbachev said.

   The Helena Symphony Chorale has given new
meaning to the idea of a singing telegram.
   The chorale recently began a ``rent-a-choir'' program, giving
people a chance to hire any number of singers to perform at an event.
   ``We can arrange anything from a solo to the whole chorale,''
says Dave Buness, chorale director.
   The rent-a-choir is pretty well booked for the holiday season, he
said, but stressed that the group's repertoire goes beyond Christmas
carols.
   ``This isn't just a Christmas activity,'' he said. ``We'd be glad
to come perform any time at all.''
   Renting the choir costs a minimum of $35. The money goes to the
Helena Symphony Society, to help pay for the chorale's annual trip
to an out-of-state music educators' convention.

   A dating service here had tried advertising in
newspapers and magazines, on television and through direct mail. But
now it's on a roll. It's on many rolls, in fact, rolls of the kind
of paper found in rest rooms.
   Jerry Womack had ads for ``Modern Love'' printed on individual
squares of toilet paper and then distributed rolls in bars and
restaurants ``where people in the 25 to 50 age range frequent.''
   ``Everybody has pens with their name on it,'' Womack said. ``I
wanted to see how far I could push the limits.''
   Womack said he thought of the idea during a meeting with Craig
King, an advertising representative for Shaw-Barton, of Coshocton,
Ohio, which was pushing calendar ads.
   He said Innovative Paper Products of Roseville, Ill., printed
about 200 ``Modern Love'' rolls for about $3 each. The ads have
generated about 120 calls in two months of distribution, making them
a success, Womack said.
   King said he thought Womack was joking when he first mentioned
toilet paper, but now mentions the option to other customers.
   ``They're amused by it, but most people don't think it's for
them,'' he said. ``Some people think it might give a derogatory name
to their product. Not everyone wants to have their name on toilet
paper.''

   Wilmington College is beginning the
second year of an offbeat student recruiting campaign that features
a small arctic animal called a lemming.
   The college reports the campaign is highly successful, either
despite or because of its use of humor in a matter young people take
very seriously.
   College spokesman Ray Wojda noted that the traditional student
recruiting features ``five nerdy kids'' standing in front of a
stately old campus building.
   By contrast, the small Quaker-related school's campaign features
a cartoon rodent who carries a Lemming State pennant, wears official
Lemming State sneakers _ ``perfect for following the crowd and
jumping to conclusions,'' the ad says _ and has eyes that are
bloodshot from straining to see the blackboard from the back of a
lecture auditorium.
   Lemmings, which look like gophers, have a destructive herd
instinct that causes them occasionally to migrate toward the sea,
where they often drown.
   The Wilmington campaign promises the college is for those who
``would rather be an active participant in your education than a
bystander.''
   Results of the campaign have ``far exceeded our expectations,''
Wojda said. Enrollment rose to a capacity 825 from 759 last fall.
Applications increased 15 percent, and entering students' scores on
the American College Test were the highest in 12 years, Wojda said.
   The ads, which were designed by the Cincinnati advertising firm
of Sullivan & Findsen, were so successful that Wilmington is trying
the humorous approach again in its annual fund-raising campaign,
featuring a parody newspaper.

<HEAD>Bakker Rails Against Media; Urges Forgiveness For Accusers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker railed against the
news media but urged followers of his New Covenant Church to forgive
his accusers Sunday in his first public remarks since being indicted
on fraud and conspiracy charges.
   ``If the news media wasn't the biggest money-maker today, would
they still pay people $1 million to lie and tell stories?'' he said
during a 20-minute message to about 400 followers. ``The love of
money is the root of all evil.''
   ``They ask us, `Why don't you attack your enemies?''' Bakker
said, his voice rising. ``The Devil wants me to renounce my
salvation and attack, attack, attack. The Bible says `Love your
enemies.'''
   ``I'm not going to lift a finger to attack my enemies. I'm not
going to lift a finger to vindicate me,'' Bakker said. ``That will
put cold chills down your enemy's spine.''
   Bakker also talked about his reaction to being fingerprinted and
having his mugshot taken at the federal courthouse in Charlotte.
   ``I looked up at all those wanted posters and I thought, `No one
is smiling _ so I smiled,''' Bakker said. ``If I'm going to be on
the walls of post offices, I'm going to smile.''
   Bakker did not allow reporters inside the converted skating rink
where his New Covenant Church holds Sunday services. However, some
of his remarks could be heard through the door.
   Bakker has declined interviews since his indictment last Monday
on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He and three of his former
associates were indicted after a 16-month federal grand jury
investigation of the PTL television ministry.
   Bakker, 48, and Richard Dortch, 57, his former top deputy at PTL,
were accused of diverting more than $4 million of their followers'
money to support their own ``lavish and extravagant'' lifestyles.
They and the others are expected to appear Thursday before U.S.
Magistrate Paul Taylor.
   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting money was
paid to buy the silence of a woman with whom he had sex.
   Meanwhile, PTL, which filed for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy law in June 1987, goes on the auction block with its
Heritage USA theme park Monday at the order of a bankruptcy judge.
   Analysts say it's unlikely creditors will get more than a
fraction of the $130 million they're owed.
   It will be the second time in a month that court-appointed
trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton will try to auction the 2,200-acre
property, which includes a 500-room hotel, a water park, a
television studio and a 2,000-seat church.
   The only certain bidder, Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick, has
let it be known he intends to offer a total of less than $70 million
cash. A month ago, he said he would pay $115 million, $50 million of
it cash.
   If the top bid doesn't satisfy U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus
Reynolds, the judge might shut down PTL and sell it piece by piece.
   As Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, entered the building Sunday,
he briefly talked about reports that more than 30 television
ministries were under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``They fear evangelism,'' he said.
   Bakker, in introducing a fellow preacher at the service, made an
apparent reference to former associate John Wesley Fletcher, who was
quoted by Penthouse magazine as saying he had a homosexual
relationship with Bakker.
   ``I've learned people I gave $100,000 to weren't my friends,'' he
said. ``It's wonderful to know you have friends. I'm talking about
people who stick with you through thick and thin.''

   Patrols watched for new fires Sunday following
the devastation of three Southern California neighborhoods struck by
wind-driven firestorms that destroyed 37 homes and charred thousands
of acres of brush.
   Firefighters warned that until rain comes to the dry mountains
that ring the Los Angeles Basin, a return of strong winds from the
deserts further inland could bring a replay of fast-moving fires.
   ``We still have a red flag alert,'' said Roger Millan, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. ``We have
people on standby. Patrols are out looking for brush fires.''
   A brush fire that did an estimated $4.3 million damage in the
fashionable hillside suburb of Porter Ranch Friday morning was
finally put out Saturday, Millan said. Firefighters combed the
burned-over area for hot spots Sunday, he said.
   Fourteen houses and a mobile home were leveled, 25 other houses
were damaged and 3,200 acres of brush was charred, but there were no
injuries.
   Residents described fleeing through a rain of fire, as wind
estimated at 60 mph or more drove flames and embers into their
neighborhood of $300,000-plus homes on the edge of the San Fernando
Valley suburbs.
   Investigators trying to determine the cause of the fire sought
two men seen in a park near the point of origin before dawn Friday,
Millan said. The men were being sought as witnesses not suspects,
Millan said.
   The Santa Ana winds, as they are known here, pick up speed as
they funnel through canyons in the mountains around Southern
California, heat by compression, dry the brush further and can
spread the smallest fire into an inferno.
   The winds, which sweep Southern California sporadically every
fall and winter, were blamed for the disastrous spread of two other
Los Angeles area fires last week.
   A total of 22 homes in La Verne, and Baldwin Park, both to the
east of downtown, were destroyed Thursday. In La Verne, a brush fire
spread into a bedroom community; in Baldwin Park, a blaze at a paper
recycling plant raged through a neighborhood of modest houses.

   From the declaration of a national day of mourning
to nationwide calls for relief, the Soviet government is using the
disastrous earthquake in Armenia to unify this country of disparate
peoples, languages and cultures.
   For nearly 50 years, World War II has served that purpose, and
the government propaganda machine still pours out stories,
documentaries and films recalling the Great Patriotic War, in which
20 million Soviets died and the Soviet Union suffered and triumphed
as a nation.
   The space program, too, is portrayed as a national endeavor.
   Today, the rallying cry is the earthquake, which has killed about
50,000 people by official estimate. The government has moved with
extraordinary speed to mobilize its vast media resources to inform
and to draw its people together.
   Official reports say the disaster has united Armenians and
Azerbaijanis, whose ancient ethnic feud was rekindled recently when
a territorial dispute resulted in violence in several cities,
leaving about 60 people dead in the months before the earthquake.
   Interethnic cooperation in disaster relief may subdue the strife,
but some Armenian activists already have complained that authorities
are shipping children orphaned by the quake out of the republic to
be cared for.
   They have charged this would constitute ``Russification,'' a
derogatory term for the Russian majority's blurring of ethnic lines.
   On Sunday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev angrily denied that
orphans were being sent out of Armenia and said the activists were
trying to create instability.
   The Soviet Union is a huge country bound more by central rule
than common purpose. Its people, spread over a sixth of the Earth's
land, represent more than 100 nationalities, speak dozens of
languages and in some cases feel more kinship with people from other
countries than with their own.
   Unlike in the United States, where a nation of immigrants prides
itself on having formed a great _ if imperfect _ melting pot,
centuries-old ethnic groups in the Soviet Union are struggling to
maintain their separate identities.
   The nation's 15 republics are held together by Kremlin power and
a national armed force, but a citizen is more likely to refer to his
or her nationality than call himself or herself a Soviet.
   Gorbachev, who returned abruptly from the United States to rush
to the stricken region, has made the earthquake a national cause.
His personal leadership in a time of crisis has contributed to a
sense of unity.
   The state-run media, which once ignored natural disasters, have
poured out information, telling and showing people throughout the
country the extent of the damage _ and the need. Newspapers and
television have been just as quick to report the response.
   The official Tass news agency has noted, for instance, that
Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan sent cranes to help raise the
rubble, that a planeload of medical supplies was dispatched from a
factory in Western Siberia, and that tents and food were dispatched
from Tadzhikistan.
   There have been similar reports in the media daily.
   The country, long isolated by suspicion and fear of foreigners,
also has opened its borders to accept aid it once would have been
too proud _ or perhaps too self-conscious _ to accept from outsiders.
   Not only has assistance come from Moscow's socialist allies but
from great and tiny nations around the world. The United States,
Denmark, Algeria, Iran are among those mentioned in a single report.
   Even assistance from nations such as Israel, with whom the Soviet
Union has no diplomatic relations and intense political disputes,
has been welcomed.
   Gorbachev, who describes himself as a realist, has been pragmatic
enough to break down barriers that his predecessors hid behind.
   ``Today, the preservation of any kind of `closed' societies is
hardly possible,'' he told the United Nations the day the quake
struck. ``The world economy is becoming a single organism, and no
state, whatever its social system or economic status, can develop
normally outside it.''

<DATELINE>BONNERS FERRY, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two badly burned bodies, dozens of
weapons and the largest marijuana growing operation ever found in
Idaho were discovered after a fire leveled a ranch house.
   The weapons included machine guns, handguns and rifles.
   ``We even found what we think is a 105mm shell for a cannon,''
said Wayne Longo, regional manager of the Idaho Bureau of Narcotics.
``Some of the weapons even had bayonets on them.''
   Several booby traps were found on the property, and state agents
wore bulletproof vests while they searched the grounds Saturday,
Longo said. The investigation continued Sunday.
   Authorities found the bodies while examining the wreckage of the
house that burned Friday night on a 40-acre ranch near Bonners Ferry
in northern Idaho.
   ``We can't even tell if they're male or female,'' said Longo.
``We're calling a pathologist to do that.''
   He said investigators don't know if the two died in the fire or
before it started. Sheriff's deputies said no identities had been
determined by Sunday afternooon.
   Authorities were unable to locate the owners of the ranch, David
and Helen Ashley. Deputies have records of at least five adults
living in the house, Longo said.
   Next to the house is an old, dilapidated barn, Longo said. But
inside, authorities found a building withing the building,
containing ``the largest and most sophisticated marijuana-growing
operation ever seen in Idaho.''
   Longo estimated the structure contained at least 1,000 marijuana
plants. ``We found plants in every single stage of growth, from
seedlings to harvested ones, drying out and ready to sell,'' he said.
   The cause of the fire was not determined by Sunday.

<TEXT>
   A solemn President Reagan visited the Soviet
Embassy on Sunday and signed a book of condolences for victims of
the Armenian earthquake, writing that he spoke for the American
people in stating, ``You are in our thoughts and prayers.''
   First lady Nancy Reagan accompanied the president and also signed
the book, writing, ``What a terrible human tragedy. Our deepest
sympathy.''
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin told the president, ``We are
deeply moved by your direct participation in our disaster, Mr.
President, and also by the participation of the American people.''
   The Reagans visited the embassy while on their way to the
historic 19th century Pension Building for the taping of an annual
television special on Christmas at the White House.
   Upon their arrival at the embassy, the Reagans walked up a
red-carpeted inner stairway accompanied by the ambassador and his
wife, and stopped briefly to view a display of photographs from the
earthquake area.
   Reagan shook his head in dismay from time to time, and Mrs.
Reagan appeared close to tears as the ambassador described the
plight of the earthquake victims.
   ``It's terrible, it's terrible, an appalling thing,'' the
ambassador said. ``This whole region, this whole area, was
destroyed.''
   The Reagans apparently murmured a few words in response, which
reporters standing across the room were unable to hear.
   The president and first lady then moved to the book, which lay
open on a table covered with a red cloth bordered in black. Mrs.
Reagan sat first and signed, and was followed by the president,
whose message in full read, ``I speak for all our people when I say
we share your sorrow. You are in our thoughts and prayers.'' He
signed the message Ronald Reagan.
   Later at the Pension Building, Reagan was asked about U.S. aid to
the earthquake victims and replied, ``We immediately offered and
they accepted and I think four of our planes have landed.''
   Asked whether discussions with the Soviets about the aid program
were continuing, he nodded and replied, ``At the State Department.''
   The embassy issued a statement saying that according to
preliminary data, the number of dead is estimated at 40,000-45,000,
with about 500,000 people left homeless.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa visited the
headquarters of four French national unions Sunday but snubbed the
largest labor federation, the communist-led General Confederation of
Labor.
   Walesa, making his first foreign visit in seven years, thanked
the four unions for their support and urged East and West Europe to
come together in peace.
   ``Something is moving in Poland, something is moving in Eastern
Europe,'' Walesa said. ``Our Europe should rejoin yours. We want to
rejoin peacefully, intelligently but with respect for the identity
and culture of each party.''
   The powerful General Confederation of Labor, currently leading a
strike that has snarled public transit in Paris for weeks, backed
the 1981 martial-law crackdown on Solidarity by Polish leader
Wojciech Jaruzelski. Over the years, it has usually followed
Moscow's lead on international policy.
   Walesa made a round of visits to the smaller French Democratic
Confederation of Labor, the French Confederation of Christian Labor,
the Workers Force and the General Confederation of Cadres, thanking
them for their support over the years.
   Although union membership figures in France are unreliable,
independent experts estimate about one-fourth of union members in
the country belong to the communist confederation, including many
non-communists.
   Walesa made only one public reference to the communist-led
confederation, saying its secretary-general, Henri Krasucki, had not
contacted him when visiting Poland. He joked that he might have lost
his address while cleaning out his pockets in anticipation of being
searched by Polish authorities. ``Perhaps I would also lose the
address in a similar situation,'' Walesa added.
   Krasucki said Saturday he found the Polish union leader's
three-day itinerary ``very significant'' and said Walesa was meeting
only leaders of unions who ``are refusing to take action and signing
accords on the backs of French workers which destroy the social
achievements of a half-century.''
   The other four unions recently signed an agreement with the Paris
transit authority that the confederation denounced as a sell-out of
workers' interests.
   Walesa was in Paris at the invitation of President Francois
Mitterrand for Saturday's celebrations marking the 40th anniversary
of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights. He and Soviet human rights
activist Andrei Sakharov met for the first time Saturday. The two
men are both Nobel Peace Prize winners _ Walesa in 1983 and Sakharov
in 1975.
   Bronislaw Geremek, a top Solidarity aide and Walesa's personal
adviser, said both men agreed the Soviet Union and Poland must make
more progress on human rights before Walesa would be willing to
participate in a proposed human rights conference in Moscow.
   Geremek said the first signs of hope for dialogue with Polish
authorities came only recently when Walesa appeared on
government-controlled television for a three-hour debate _ media
exposure which he has long been denied.
   ``Maybe we can finish this year with progress,'' Geremek said.
   Walesa has started each day at a Mass sung in Polish at the
Polish Roman Catholic community's 17th century domed church off the
Place de la Concorde.
   On Sunday he met Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, the Polish-born
Roman Catholic archbishop of Paris, who described Walesa as living
proof that ``freedom is the most precious of all the qualities in
the world, because nothing can bind a man who is free to think, love
and forgive.''
   Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner spent a quiet and private
Sunday shopping and lunching at an Italian restaurant.
   Neither Sakharov nor Walesa have conducted high-profile visits,
nor have they publicly criticized the Polish or Soviet governments.
They have limited brief statements to general human rights issues
and appeals for help for earthquake victims in Armenia.

<TEXT>
   Rescuers in this earthquake-ravaged
city struggled Sunday with poor equipment and organization to free a
dwindling number of trapped survivors after saving at least 1,500.
   Adding to the tragedy of this stricken city, a Soviet military
transport plane carrying soldiers to help in rescue efforts crashed
as it approached a city airport, killing 78 people, Tass said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wound up a two-day visit to the
disaster area and called Wednesday's earthquake in Armenia ``a grave
disaster, simply a tragedy.''
   ``It is simply difficult to bear this in human terms. It is
unbearable,'' Gorbachev told Soviet television.
   He exhorted rescuers to speed their efforts, warning an epidemic
of disease could break out within a few days.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, were shown consoling survivors and
speaking with rescuers in Spitak, a city of 16,000 that was
virtually destroyed by the quake, and in Kirovakan 10 miles to the
east.
   He said 3,900 soldiers from the region who are performing
military service throughout the country were being granted leave to
return home.
   The estimated death toll increased. Doctors Without Borders, an
international relief organization, said in Amsterdam that Health
Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov told workers the quake had claimed
50,000-60,000 lives. The previous government estimate was
40,000-45,000, an estimate the the Soviet Embassy in Washington was
still using Sunday.
   The embassy also said about 500,000 were left homeless and 6,000
people were hospitalized. It said 1,500 people have been rescued so
far.
   Soviet officials, including Gorbachev, denied charges Sunday that
children orphaned by the quake were being sent from Armenia to other
parts of the Soviet Union.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said on
the British TV-AM program that 22 people were arrested in Yerevan on
Saturday when about 600 protested over the orphan issue.
   He denied the children were being shipped away. But he added,
``Suppose we had too many Armenian children to be adopted in
Armenia, why should you object to Russians or people of any other
nationality helping here?''
   The earthquake has aggravated an already severe refugee problem
in the southern republic of Armenia, where thousands of ethnic
Armenians fled because of anti-Armenian rioting in neighboring
Azerbaijan.
   The Kremlin has rebuffed efforts by Armenian nationalists to
annex an Armenian-dominated region of Azerbaijan, and a dissident
source told a London newspaper that Soviet authorities Saturday
arrested about half of the 11 leaders of a nationalist group.
   In his television comments Sunday, Gorbachev accused supporters
of annexation of trying to take advantage of instability created by
the earthquake to push for control of the Armenian enclave.
   ``They are waging a battle for power, and they must be stopped,''
he said.
   He also promised Armenians an investigation into why new
buildings collapsed in the quake while older structures generally
remained standing.
   Many survivors took shelter in tents on Sunday, when temperatures
were in the low 40s.
   In Leninakan, Armenia's second-largest city near the Turkish
border, stacks of red, black or unfinished wood coffins were piled
on street corners.
   Mayor Emil Kirokofyan told the first group of foreign
correspondents to visit the area after Wednesday's quake that
recently constructed apartment buildings were not built to withstand
such a severe temblor _ even though Leninakan is located in an area
of frequent earthquakes.
   Choking back tears, the mayor told reporters he lost 15 relatives.
   Hundreds of bonfires fueled by cardboard, trash or debris
provided the only heat for people who had spent the last four nights
on the streets, and sent a pall of smoke over the city of 250,000
people.
   ``I don't have anywhere to live. I am homeless,'' cried an old
woman walking out of rescue headquarters, where officials had put
her on a list for new housing.
   Everywhere, officials and rescuers pleaded for more cranes and
heavy equipment to drag slabs of concrete and twisted pillars off
trapped people.
   At one site, rescuers worked feverishly with saws, torches,
hammers and crowbars to free a family of seven discovered near the
top of what was a nine-story apartment building.
   Survivors who spoke about the tragedy described a series of three
or four quakes separated by brief pauses.
   ``There was a hum and then everything started to shake, to the
left and to the right. It was like a ship,'' said Anna Asatyan, who
sat at a bonfire in the street in front of her home.
   A U.N. Disaster Relief Agency official said the local rescue
effort was poorly organized, and that it might be too late to catch
up.
   Relief from abroad continued to flow in.
   A Belgian relief team of experts carrying 40 tons of equipment
including four-wheel-drive vehicles left for Yerevan on Sunday, as
did an Israeli plane with a 42-person team headed by an army general.
   Although the Soviet Union does not officially recognize Israel,
the Israelis offered to help soon after the quake. Two more planes
are scheduled to take off Monday.
   One Dutch medical relief crew was refused visas. Soviet diplomats
claimed no more foreign relief was needed, according to a Red Cross
spokesman said in Amsterdam on condition of anonymity.
   Foreign relief workers said they ran into snags upon reaching the
disaster areas.
   ``The relief effort until you reach the spot here has been very
good,'' said Sverre Kilde, a Norwegian U.N. officer. ``But here on
the spot there is no control.''
   Kilde said a French rescue team estimated survivors could hold
out only for another three to four days, and that any new equipment
sent from abroad probably would not arrive in time.
   Mayor Kirokofyan told reporters the newer apartment buildings had
been constructed to withstand a shock of 7 to 8 on the 12-point
Soviet scale of damage. But he said the quake registered 10 in
Leninakan, and the buildings crumbled.

   Rock 'n' roll pioneer Roy Orbison was
eulogized Sunday as a singer who ``touched the lives of millions''
around the world.
   About 75 friends and music industry associates attended a
30-minute memorial service for Orbison, the performer known for hits
such as ``Oh, Pretty Woman,'' ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Crying.''
   ``He became a legend in his own time,'' the Rev. Larry Gilmore
said in his eulogy to Orbison, who died of a heart attack Tuesday at
52.
   ``He touched the lives of millions throughout the world,''
Gilmore told those gathered at College Heights Baptist Church, about
30 miles northeast of Nashville. Orbison worshiped at the church.
   ``His ability in music is unquestioned,'' Gilmore said. ``A world
has benefited from what he shared in the music industry.''
   It was the first memorial service for Orbison, who was known for
his ever-present sunglasses, dark attire and ebony pompadour during
his 30-year singing career.
   A similar gathering, termed a ``celebration of life,'' is
scheduled for Tuesday night at a nightclub in Los Angeles, the name
of which is being released only to friends and associates.
   Orbison lived in Malibu, Calif., for the past four years. Prior
to that, he had lived in Nashville for 30 years.
   He was enjoying a career comeback at the time of his death as a
member of the Traveling Wilburys whose album of that name is one of
the top selling in the country. Other members of the group are Bob
Dylan, ex-Beatle George Harrison and Tom Petty.
   Among those attending the memorial Sunday were Orbison's brother,
Sam, and one of his three sons, Wesley. The mourners sat quietly
showing little emotion.
   ``I know that he would want us to have a time of thanksgiving,''
Gilmore told them in the eulogy.
   ``Roy didn't like funerals,'' Gilmore said. ``He detested them.''
   Orbison's body was flown Saturday to Los Angeles. Barbara, his
widow, flew to Los Angeles on Wednesday from her native Germany,
where she was visiting friends when the singer died near Nashville
while visiting his mother.
   A private burial was planned.

   Authorities said Sunday they are
developing a list of possible suspects in a series of related
slayings in southeastern Massachusetts, and that a sixth female body
was found over the weekend.
   District Attorney Ronald Pina said informants are providing
valuable information.
   ``We have a list of potential suspects,'' Pina said. ``There are
people who are known to do things like this and there are people who
are giving us some information.''
   He spoke at a news conference at the site where the body was
found the previous day, in a wooded area about a quarter mile from
Interstate 195 in Dartmouth. Nearby, police were still collecting
parts of the badly decomposed body.
   The remains, found by hunters in a gravel pit and still
unidentified Sunday, was determined to be the sixth female body
found since July in within a few miles of one another outside this
fishing port of 98,000 people. Pina has said the five bodies found
up until Saturday were likely the victim of the same killer or
killers.
   Investigators have identified three of the bodies as women
between the ages of 25 and 36 who had ties to New Bedford's Weld
Square neighborhood, known for prostitution and drug sales.
   Pina said the sixth woman could not definitely be linked to the
others, but was partly clad like the others.
   The sixth body appeared to have been in the woods longer than any
of the others, possibly since last spring, Pina said.
   An autopsy was scheduled for Monday, and police continued
searching the wooded area.

   More than 200 young people staged an
anti-government march after a Mass in Gdansk and threw stones at a
police station Sunday, the official PAP news agency said.
   The agency said the predominantly teen-age demonstrators chanted,
``There is No Freedom Without Solidarity,'' and ``Down with the
Commune'' after a service at St. Brygida's Church, a stronghold of
the banned Solidarity independent union movement.
   The youth threw stones at a police station and broke windows,
then dispersed when special riot police squadrons arrived, PAP said.
   Joanna Wojciechowska, a Solidarity spokeswoman in Gdansk, said
about 300 teen-agers marched after Mass around the city's Old Town
section with virtually no police interference.
   She said older Solidarity activists did not know the unorganized
group and were trying to get the young people to end their protest,
but she said the teen-agers were encouraged by the fact that no
police were present.
   ``It was a case of youthful aggression against police which could
not be stopped,'' she said.
   Only after nearly all the station's windows were broken did riot
police come to chase away the marchers, she said.
   Solidarity, the first independent union federation in the Soviet
bloc, was crushed with the imposition of martial law in 1981 and
banned in 1982.

   President Reagan said Sunday that approaching
his last Christmas season in the White House is ``a kind of mixed,
bittersweet thing'' as he prepares to return to California after his
term ends Jan. 20.
   Reagan was asked about his feelings as he and his wife, Nancy,
took part in the taping of the seventh annual NBC television
special, ``Christmas in Washington.''
   ``It has to be a kind of mixed, bittersweet thing,'' he said.
``We have to say goodbye to a lot of people we are going to miss. On
the other hand, we look forward to being home.''
   The Reagans will spend Christmas day in Los Angeles, where they
will live after the president leaves office, but Mrs. Reagan has
said they plan a family Christmas celebration at the White House on
Dec. 22, before they leave for the holiday.

   Emperor Hirohito was almost completely comatose
Sunday after several days of heavy internal bleeding, news reports
said.
   National newspapers quoted unidentified palace sources as saying
the 87-year-old emperor's heavy bleeding this past week and the
resulting loss of blood pressure damaged his liver and kidneys, and
palace officials have said his brain has been damaged.
   ``According to agency sources, the emperor now appears to be
almost completely comatose,'' said the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's
largest newspaper. ``His body responds to physical stimulus, but
even when his eyes are open he now completely fails to respond to
people calling his name.''
   Hirohito has been suffering from internal bleeding since his
health suddenly worsened nearly three months ago. During that time
he has received 52.9 pints of blood.
   Palace officials have said the bleeding appears to be near his
upper intestine, where he underwent an intestinal bypass operation
last year. The Yomiuri on Sunday quoted palace officials as saying
the bleeding may have spread to his stomach wall.
   Palace officials continued to refuse to comment on news reports
that the emperor has cancer.
   Under the constitution, Hirohito has no political power but
serves as a symbol of the unity of Japan.

<TEXT>
   A high Soviet official will meet soon
with Pakistan-based Afghan rebels for more peace talks, and Moscow
has proposed direct talks with the guerrillas' Iran-based allies,
rebel leaders said.
   A spokesman for the rebels in Pakistan, Burhannudin Rabbani, said
their meeting with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri Vorontsov
would take place in the next two weeks. Rabbani spoke in a telephone
interview from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   A Pakistan government official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the meeting would take place in Islamabad. He
did not say when.
   Rabbani denied news reports that the rebels would accept an
international peace conference proposed by the Soviet and Afghan
governments. ``We reject this conference. It is between us and the
Russians,'' he said.
   The seven-party guerrilla alliance, supported by the United
States and Pakistan, negotiated with the Soviets from Dec. 3 to 5 in
Taif, Saudi Arabia. The private meeting was the first between the
Soviets and representatives of the anti-communist rebels since
Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan in 1979.
   The Soviet Union has also offered to hold direct talks with
leaders of the Afghan resistance based in Iran, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency of Iran reported Sunday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, quoted a spokesman for
the Iran-based fundamentalist rebel alliance as saying ``After 10
years of occupation, the Soviets were finally forced to accept that
the Afghan people and the Mujahedeen (rebels) have a major role and
have agreed to talks.''
   The spokesman said that the Iran-based alliance was studying the
Soviet offer and had not yet made a decision whether to accept, the
television broadcast said.
   Most of the fighting against the Soviet troops in Afghanistan has
been conducted by the Pakistan-based rebels, but the Iran-based
rebels have conducted separate operations.
   The news agency said a delegation from the Pakistan-based
alliance was due in Tehran for consultations, but it did not say
when.
   During his recent trip to New York, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev called for an international peace conference on
Afghanistan and a cease-fire.
   The Soviet Union, which has withdrawn half its 100,000 troops
under a U.N. accord, recently suspended the withdrawal after
complaining that Pakistan and the United States were still arming
the rebels, who have continued fighting.
   ``There is no room for a cease-fire,'' said Rabbani. ``The
Russians must move from Afghanistan.''
   He said Vorontsov assured the Afghan resistance leaders that the
Soviets were ``ready to go'' from Afghanistan.
   The rebels repeatedly have called for the removal of Afghan
President Najib and the disbanding of his Marxist People's
Democratic Party.
   At the talks in Saudi Arabia, Vorontsov reportedly refused to
make any commitments about Najib's future, but Rabbani said the
Soviet official did not close the doors to possible changes in the
Kabul government.
   ``He said everything can be discussed,'' said Rabbani.
   The resistance leader said the most significant outcome of the
direct talks was Moscow's tacit recognition of the Moslem insurgents.
   ``Before, the Russians did not recognize the rebels,'' said
Rabbani, whose Jamiat-e-Islami rebel group largely controls the
strategic Salang Highway leading from the Afghan capital to the
Soviet Union.

   Thousands of Armenian-Americans attended church services Sunday
to pray for those killed in the earthquake that shattered their
homeland, consoling each other with tales of the endurance of their
people and marveling at others' generosity.
   ``It's something that is going to be in Armenian memories
forever,'' Odette Hambarsoomian, 28, said of the quake while waiting
for Mass to begin at St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church in the Los
Angeles suburb of Glendale.
   ``There's not any family here that does not have relatives in
Armenia,'' said the Rev. Nareg Shrikian in Glendale.
   A hastily assembled telethon drew $2.8 million in pledges, said
Los Angeles station KSCI-TV. The telethon, which ran from midnight
Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday on the West Coast, was shown on that
station, on cable channels throughout Southern California, and on
independent stations in Houston; Norfolk, Va.; Seattle; San
Francisco; and Sacramento, Calif.
   In Cambridge, Mass., Cardinal Bernard Law participated in a Mass
with about 200 Armenians on Sunday and announced that a special
collection made Sunday at churches in the Boston Roman Catholic
Archdiocese would go toward relief efforts.
   ``Once again, the Armenian people around the world are undergoing
another tragedy,'' said Bishop Norvan Zakarian of Lyon, France,
delivering a guest sermon during Mass at Saint Vartan Cathedral in
New York City, the diocesan headquarters for the Armenian Church of
America. ``The whole Armenian people of the world are in deep
mourning.''
   Zakarian's remarks in Armenian were translated for reporters by
an Armenian-American journalist.
   ``We Armenians are used to destruction and desolation,'' the Rev.
Garen Gdanian said at St. Peter's Armenian Apostolic Church in
Watervliet, N.Y., near Albany.
   Gdanian touched on the various empires that have subjugated the
Armenian people through the centuries, from the Mongols to the Turks.
   ``But little Armenia is still sticking around. Where are all
those others?'' he asked.
   In Syracuse, N.Y., tiny St. John's Armenian Apostolic Church is
too small to have a permanent priest so it had no special service
Sunday. But church member Garbis Garboushian said his 40-member
congregation had managed to raise a few thousand dollars and collect
clothing, blankets and boots for the quake victims.
   ``The church hall is quite full,'' he said.
   St. Paul's Armenian Apostolic Church, also in Syracuse, had
received between $3,000 and $5,000 in donations, mostly from
non-Armenian churches, said parish council chairman Mike Mikaelian.
   ``The generosity of the public is fantastic,'' said Edward
Belemjian, parish council chairman for St. Peter's in Watervliet.
``At work people come up to me and give me checks without my
asking.''
   ``Little children have come in and given us their Christmas
donations,'' said Hazel Barsamian, who is working with the Armenian
Relief Society's Chicago chapter.
   ``This little girl came with her grandfather and she apparently
had a piggy bank that she was saving for Christmas. She said
`Grandpa, instead of me getting something, why don't I give this'''
for the earthquake victims, Ms. Barsamian said.
   In New York City, the Rev. Yeznig Balian and others noted that
the very fact that the Soviet Union agreed to accept help from the
outside, including the United States, was one encouraging outgrowth
of the tragedy.
   ``If there is any silver lining to a tragedy like this, it would
be the openness of the system right now,'' Balian said.
   While many kept busy gathering donations of money and supplies,
others had more personal concerns.
   For Gerry Nazarian in New York, the quest for information was
sadly fruitful. He spoke to relatives in California, who called
family in Moscow, who reached relatives in Yerevan, who got hold of
family members in Leninakan, one of the hardest-hit cities.
   ``The last word we had last night (was that) two of our cousins
are dead,'' Nazarian said. ``They were in an office and the entire
office building collapsed. ... It's terrible, terrible. I couldn't
sleep all night. I mean, the whole family is so upset.
   ``It's ... that pain _ you just can't describe it.''
   ``Armenians have a way of surviving. We have a history of this
kind of tragedy,'' said Ms. Barsamian in Chicago. ``We are fighters,
we are survivors, we stand together and we will survive. And we will
help.''

   The Space Shuttle Atlantis, riding
piggy-back atop a modified Boeing 747, completed the first leg of
its return trip to Florida on Sunday, officials said.
   The orbiter, back from a classified military space flight,
arrived at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base here at 5:55 p.m., after a
90-minute flight from Edwards Air Force Base in California,
officials said.
   The crew of the piggy-back flight planned to wait overnight for
weather reports, said Joseph D'Agostino, spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Rain in Texas and Florida on
Sunday, if it continued, could delay completion of the flight to
Cape Canaveral on Monday, he said.
   Flying through rain can damage the thousands of ceramic tiles
affixed to the shuttle's belly to ward off the heat of re-entry into
the Earth's atmosphere, D'Agostino said.
   The return trip probably would be completed in two more hops,
D'Agostino said: from Davis-Monthan to Kelly Air Force Base outside
San Antonio, Texas, and then to Florida.

   A natural gas pipeline exploded and burned
Sunday, forcing residents of two nearby subdivisions to be evacuated
for about three hours before the fire was controlled, authorities
said.
   The explosion occurred just after 3:30 p.m. about five miles west
of Carthage, a town of 6,500 in Panola County near the Louisiana
border, said Travis Cadenhead, dispatcher for the Carthage Fire
Department.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   ``It's a pretty good explosion,'' he said. ``I don't know what
the damage is.''
   Two small subdivisions, with about 30 homes and 100 residents,
were evacuated as a precaution for about three hours, authorities
said.
   Firefighters shut off the flow of gas and then brought the flames
under control. U.S. Highway 79, closed while the fire was being
controlled, was reopened about 6:15 p.m.
   Mary Minigh, a dispatcher for the Carthage Police Department,
said her granddaughter, who lives across from the gas line, told her
she saw a cloud of black smoke cover the highway and heard an
explosion.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the
right-wing Likud bloc, renewed talks Sunday with the rival Labor
Party in hopes of forming a national unity government by week's end,
Israel radio said.
   Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, leader of left-leaning
Labor, agreed each party would set up a three-member negotiating
team to hammer out the coalition agreement, the radio said.
   In elections last month, Likud won 40 seats and Labor won 39. But
Likud was able to forge a tentative coalition with small Orthodox
and extreme right-wing parties, giving it control over more than
half of the 120-member Parliament and the upper hand in coalition
talks.
   ``We should not stretch out these negotiations,'' said Moshe
Shahal, a member of Labor's negotiating team. ``It should take two
or three days.''
   A Likud spokesman told the radio the new government would be
similar to the joint government formed after the 1984 elections
ended in a stalemate. Peres was prime minister for two years and
handed power to Shamir in 1986.
   But it is unlikely that Likud will agree this time to share the
prime ministry with Labor.
   For the last four years, the policy of the coalition government
has been paralyzed by disagreements on the future of the occupied
territories and peace negotiations.
   Likud and Labor still are split over the proposal to hold an
international Middle East conference, which Peres favors; and over
the establishment of new Jewish settlements in the occupied areas.
Likud and its allies want new settlements.
   Likud has offered Labor the Foreign Ministry on condition that
Labor pursue no new diplomatic initiatives without Likud's approval.
The demand was seen as a way of stifling Peres' call for the
international peace conference.

   Police said Sunday they believe a man
whose body was left in a wooden box on a riverbank three years ago
was a tenant of the woman who ran a boardinghouse where seven bodies
have been unearthed.
   Authorities said the latest body linked to Dorothea Montalvo
Puente was dumped on the Sacramento River's east bank in adjacent
Sutter County more than two years before the bodies were buried in
the yard of Puente's downtown boardinghouse. Those seven bodies were
discovered last month.
   Puente, 59, has been charged with one count of murder in the
boardinghouse case, and additional counts are expected to be filed
in January. Coroner's officials have said the boardinghouse victims
all died in 1988. Police believe they were tenants killed by Puente
for their Social Security checks.
   On Saturday, police arrested Ismael Carrasco Florez, 46, a
Sacramento handyman authorities accused of building the coffinlike
box for Puente and helping her truck it to the river in late 1985.
   Florez was booked in Sacramento County jail on suspicion of being
an accessory to murder. He was released later the same day on $3,000
bail.
   ``Florez has been identified as the subject who built the wooden
box in which a victim was placed and then transported to Sutter
County by he and Dorothea Puente,'' police Capt. Michael O'Kane said.
   The name of the victim was withheld until his identity could be
confirmed. He was described as a 55-year-old white man with a
mustache and false teeth. O'Kane said earlier reports that the
victim was a woman were incorrect.
   Asked if police believe Puente might be linked to any deaths
beyond the eight, O'Kane said: ``That's a possibility, but we have
to deal with how many people we can trace to her and where they
are.''
   He said investigators are still trying to locate two former
tenants of the boardinghouse, which catered largely to poor people
and alcoholics. ``There may be a couple we may never find,'' he
said. ``That doesn't mean they have been are slain. It could mean
they just disappeared.''
   The body found in Sutter County was discovered by a fisherman on
New Year's Day 1986, about two miles south of Verona and about 20
miles north of Sacramento. O'Kane said the man had been dead two to
four weeks when his body was discovered in well-made, 6-foot plywood
coffin.
   O'Kane said Sutter County authorities contacted police about a
possible link between the body and Puente because it had been
wrapped in plastic like many of the bodies unearthed in the yard of
her rooming house.
   Police traced Florez through the registration of a pickup truck
he once owned. O'Kane said Florez did a variety of carpentry jobs
for Puente at the boardinghouse but hasn't been linked to any of the
other deaths.
   The handyman told police that he didn't know what was in the box,
The Sacramento Bee reported Sunday. Police spoke to him at his home
Friday and took him Saturday to the river bank where the body was
found.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu on
Sunday challenged the government to charge him with treason, saying
he is as guilty as four black activists sentenced to prison last
week.
   Also Sunday, a human rights group released the text of an open
letter to President P.W. Botha from blacks detained without charge
at Johannesburg Prison, demanding that they be tried or freed.
   In an article in the Sunday Star newspaper, Tutu protested the
sentences imposed Thursday at the end of a three-year treason trial.
Four activists, including three senior leaders of the United
Democratic Front, received prison terms ranging from six to 12 years
for treason.
   Tutu, leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa, was a
sponsor of the United Democratic Front when the nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition was formed in 1983 and has supported it
steadfastly since then.
   The group was banned in February, and the judge in the treason
trial declared it a revolutionary organization which sought the
violent overthrow of the government.
   ``If these four men have committed treason, then I have committed
treason and should face charges as well,'' Tutu wrote. He urged that
the four be granted bail during an appeal process.
   ``Whatever happens, I will campaign as I have never campaigned
before until they are released,'' he said. ``Whether or not the law
was properly applied, the effect of this judgment will be to
discourage people from peaceful opposition.''
   Convicted were Patrick Lekota, a spokesman for the front; its
national secretary Popo Molefe; and Moses Chikane, the Transvaal
Province branch secretary.
   The fourth activist convicted of treason, along with front
leaders, was Tom Manthata, a South African Council of Churches field
worker. Manthata was dispatched by Tutu in 1984 to monitor the
township rioting which prompted the treason charges.
   The Johannesburg detainees, in a letter released by South
Africa's recently established Human Rights Commission, said they
would observe a one-day fast Monday to protest the 30-month-old
state of emergency.
   Emergency regulations allow indefinite detention without charge.
An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying periods
during the emergency, and about 1,000 are believed held at present.
   In their letter to Botha, the detainees said: ``We have in our
midst people who have been kept more than 24 months in detention...
We have children whose lives are being wasted here and who may not
recuperate from the effects of detention... Some held with us have
been tortured.''
   ``If you are convinced that we committed some sort of crime, you
have the courts of law to try us,'' the letter said. ``It is against
this background that we categorically demand our immediate release.''
   The Human Rights Commission, in an accompanying statement, said
there were about 180 detainees at Johannesburg Prison. It described
them as ``prisoners of war in a country that is in a state of civil
war with its own citizens.''
   In a separate development, the main association of Afrikaner
business executives said a fact-finding team sent to Western Europe
had concluded that tougher sanctions against South Africa were
inevitable unless major political changes took place.
   The team said Europe's attitude would soften only if South Africa
adopted a political system acceptable to a majority of blacks, who
at present have no vote in national affairs. Gradual reforms such as
those advocated by the government would not be sufficient to avert
tougher embargos, the group said.
   South Africa's mainly Dutch-descended Afrikaners make up about 60
percent of the white population of 5 million and dominate the
governing National Party.

   About 100 people turned out Sunday night to
remember one of America's most celebrated protests as the 215th
anniversary of the Boston Tea Party approaches.
   But it was the leaves of trees, not tea, that members of area
militia groups dumped overboard from the Brig Beaver II, a replica
of the original vessel, into Boston Harbor.
   The militia men dressed as Indians to re-enact the Dec. 16, 1773,
dumping that revolutionaries carried out to protect tariffs on one
of their favorite brews.
   The celebration was held Sunday, a few days before the
anniversary, to attract more spectators. The Boston Tea Party Ship
and Museum offered free admission all day.
   ``The commemorative re-enactment is part of the Boston Tea Party
Ship and Museum's ongoing effort to remind Americans that our right
to non-violent protest started here,'' the museum said in an
announcement.

<HEAD>`The Heidi Chronicles,' A New Play by Wendy Wasserstein, Opens
Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Heidi Holland knows about art and artists,
especially little-known female painters of the last several hundred
years. She can talk at length about their work and how they were
ignored or denigrated by other painters, the public or both. In
these respects, she's a knowledgable woman.
   What Heidi doesn't know about is life, particularly the problem
of sorting out what kind of person she would like to be if she ever
becomes an adult. That's a lot harder to deal with, she says.
   But the woman makes an attempt to find out about herself in ``The
Heidi Chronicles,'' Wendy Wasserstein's perceptive and very funny
new play about what it's like growing up female in the 1960s, '70s
and '80s.
   The play, which opened Sunday at off-Broadway's Playwrights
Horizons, traces one woman's confusion, from the tentative
beginnings of the woman's movement in the 1960s to the post-feminism
of today when ``traditional values,'' that favorite buzz word of
current politicians, have reasserted themselves with a vengeance.
   In between, Heidi takes a Candide-like journey that carries her
through various stages of social, sexual and political awareness.
She travels pretty much as an outsider, looking in on the problems
and foibles of her friends and lovers. But unlike Candide, she
questions everything and everybody she comes across.
   The people she meets _ and they keep popping up with some
regularity _ include Scoop Rosenbaum, a cocky journalist who starts
out working for something called the Liberation Earth News in the
late 1960s and ends up as the owner of Boomer, a big magazine
success of 20 years later. The two start out as lovers and end up as
friends.
   Her other constant male friend is a caustic young man who becomes
the most successful pediatrician in Manhattan. He also happens to be
gay, a fact he reveals to Heidi during a demonstration at the Art
Institute of Chicago against its sexist exhibition policies.
   Heidi also watches the evolution of her best friend Susan who
goes from clerking for a Supreme Court justice to tending sheep on a
woman's collective in Montana to producing a successful television
series. That certainly is some resume, but not an unlikely
combination for Miss Wasserstein to concoct. The playwright, who
also wrote the equally hilarious ``Isn't It Romantic,'' is a witty
social commentator with a deadly accuracy for skewering the trendy
conventions of our time.
   Despite its many laughs, the play has serious intentions, too.
The evening culminates dramatically in an impassionated speech by
Heidi to her high school alumnae society. In it, the woman explains
that she is still unhappy despite some success in life.
   ``I thought the whole point was that we wouldn't feel stranded,''
Heidi proclaims. ``I thought the point was we were all in this
together.''
   The play ends on a surprising note, perhaps too surprising for
what has gone before, but it's a hopeful note, too, suggesting that
Miss Wasserstein has not lost her belief that things really have
gotten better for women.
   Joan Allen portrays Heidi as an intellectual idealist, trying to
rationalize her way into doing the right thing. Her indecision is
fascinating to watch. It's an incisive performance.
   Peter Friedman is oily but charming as the aggressive Scoop. He
keeps the man's obnoxiousness at bay, as he climbs the ladder of
yuppie success. Boyd Gaines' gay doctor masks a compassion behind an
acid-tongued exterior, and his conflict adds an undertone of
darkness to what could be just a comic part. Among the other members
of the large cast, Joanne Camp makes a strong impression in several
roles, particularly a strident feminist and a tough but shallow
television talk show host.
   Director Daniel Sullivan has marshaled the play's many scenes as
if they were revue sketches. The pace is as fast as the quick
movement of Thomas Lynch's mobile settings that glide and fly across
the tiny stage. The costumes by Jennifer von Mayrhauser accurately
mirror the nearly 25-year span the play covers.
   ``The Heidi Chronicles'' is a modern-day, feminist Odyssey told
with wit, style and a great deal of compassion.

   When residents of this town on the west
side of Indianapolis woke up Sunday, their 56 houses were still
standing but their town no longer existed.
   A resolution signed by Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut two
months ago took effect Saturday and dissolved the financially
troubled Marion County town.
   Lynhurst was once on the outskirts of Indianapolis. In the
mid-1970s, however, the city government and city boundaries were
reorganized to cover the whole of Marion County. But town boards
with limited powers still existed in many of the villages in the
county.
   In Lynhurst, town board members voted 2-1 in late July to being
dissolution procedures, because they could find no way to pay a
$4,100 bill owed to the Wayne Township Fire Department.
   Town Board President Mary Jane Kern said the town also had other
outstanding bills totaling less than $500. The town had $36,000 in
other funds, mostly from the state highway department, but that
money could not legally be used to pay the outstanding debts.
   The remaining funds, and the responsibility for paying the
outstanding bills, now go to the city-county government.

<HEAD>Arrest Warrant Issued For Spy Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Berlin justice officials said they issued an
arrest warrant Sunday for a 47-year-old businessman suspected of
being involved in a spy ring that delivered military secrets to the
Soviets.
   ``Three people are being investigated on suspicion of
espionage,'' said Detlev Achammer, a spokesman for the West Berlin
Justice Department. He refused to identify the suspects or provide
details.
   An arrest warrant for a second suspect was issued on Thursday,
Achammer said.
   A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said
Friday that a man was detained and questioned in Munich in
connection with the investigation.
   Spokesman Hans-Juergen Foerster said the man was released because
of lack of evidence.
   Neither spokesman would comment on newspaper reports that the
trio obtained secret documents detailing the sophisticated
electronic systems of West Germany's Leopard II tank.
   The Cologne Express newspaper on Saturday reported that some of
the documents were delivered to the KGB, the Soviet intelligence
agency.
   It said the suspected agents worked with a KGB contact officer
stationed with the Soviet trade mission in East Berlin.
   In a related report, the Welt am Sonntag newspaper said Sunday
that a woman suspect told authorities that she and her husband
worked for the KGB for years.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified security sources in Bonn,
said the suspects delivered secret documents to the Soviets
detailing the tank's electronic target guidance system and its
onboard computer.

   If Christmas always seems to bring out
that feeling of ``Oh, what fun it ISN'T to pick out the tree,'' take
heart _ things are looking up.
   Cultivating Christmas trees, once a disorganized endeavor, is
fast becoming a sophisticated industry and there are more and better
trees to choose from.
   ``The business of Christmas trees has become a mature type of
enterprise,'' said David Baumann, associate director of the
33-year-old National Christmas Tree Association in Milwaukee.
``People are getting very knowledgeable on what they need to grow,
market and care for trees.''
   Anyone who has gone to the local lot and agonized over what
always seems like the most important decision of the holiday season
knows that hasn't always been the case.
   In the 1950s nearly 90 percent of the trees sold in the United
States came from natural stands where people went in the woods and
cut them down. What you saw was what you got. Consequently, most
markets suffered shortages and most of what did arrive on the lot
was of inferior quality.
   ``Twenty years ago they were cutting a lot of trees out of the
wild,'' said Hal Schudel, who operates Holiday Tree Farms in
Corvallis, Ore., with his three sons. ``And oftentimes they were cut
way back in early October. Those trees then laid around and they
might be pretty good, but they'd dry out.''
   The big breakthrough for farmers was the realization that to
control quality and improve harvesting techniques they had to
operate on a plantation basis. The NCTA estimates that 90 percent of
the trees sold now are grown on plantations.
   ``We gradually saw the light,'' says Schudel, who has been in the
business for over 30 years and sells between 400,000 and 500,000
trees a year from his farm on the fringe of the Cascade Mountains.
``We decided to plant trees in rows to see if we could grow them
that way as a farmer would his corn. We were able to control weeds
better and spray our crop to protect it from the weeds and brush,
and we were able to grow more trees per acre and manage it as a
crop.''
   Shortages, which aided the dramatic rise in popularity of the
artificial tree, no longer are a problem. Not even the severe
drought that hampered farmers throughout the summer has put a dent
in this year's harvest. The NCTA expects a record 34.1 million trees
will be cut for the holidays, an increase of 800,000 over last year.
   ``The growers in this country have come a long way in producing a
good quality product,'' said Schudel, who brings much of his harvest
down from the mountains by helicopter to ensure its freshness.
``There's plenty of trees of good quality available now. If
distribution is good there's no need to settle for anything but a
good tree.''
   Today, farmers have set their sights on growing the ultimate tree.
   ``The whole effort is toward the perfect tree,'' Baumann said.
``People don't want a Charlie Brown Christmas tree.''
   For the most part, the consumer isn't getting that anymore. Using
the latest horticultural technology, trees are nurtured, fertilized
and pruned for the eight to 15 years it takes them to grow from
eight- to 10-inch seedlings into full, symmetrical trees six to
seven feet tall.
   Some still do it the old-fashioned way.
   ``We used to pick our own seeds from about 40 bushels of cones,''
said Florence Belle, who's worked in the business for more than 40
years and has a stand of 1,000 saplings on her property near Saranac
Lake in the Adirondack Mountains. ``Then we'd put them on racks and
dry them out.''
   Growers in Michigan, which along with Oregon produces upward of 6
million trees _ the most in the nation _ have begun tagging many of
their trees in an effort to demonstrate that their product is a
notch above the competition. And farmers in Illinois, Indiana,
Oregon, Washington, California and New York are following suit.
   ``Growers want trees grown in their state to be known in the same
way that Idaho potatoes or Florida oranges are known,'' Baumann said.
   According to figures compiled by the NCTA, demand for real trees
has grown an average of 2.2 percent a year over the past decade. In
a recent study conducted by Pennsylvania State University, 39
percent of the households surveyed used real trees and 35 percent
had artificial ones, while 26 percent did not have a tree.
   The NCTA is helping out with a million-dollar television ad
campaign _ its first ever. The spots, which started airing right
after Thanksgiving, feature weatherman Willard Scott urging watchers
to have a ``real tree Merry Christmas.''
   Growers maintain a real tree is still a bargain, too.
   ``We can measure retail prices,'' Baumann said. ``And what we've
discovered is that over the last 20 years they've gone up about half
the rate of the consumer price index.''
   The association said 1988 retail prices should range from $3.00
to $5.25 a foot, varying with the quality of the tree and local
market conditions.

<HEAD>Upstate Company Is Leading Manufacturer Of Artificial Christmas

<TEXT>
   In just six years, Si Spiegel and Larry
Squarci have soared to the top of one of the Christmas season's most
profitable industries _ the artificial tree.
   Hudson Valley Tree Inc., located in this city 60 miles north of
New York City, is one of the nation's largest manufacturers of
artificial Christmas trees.
   In the six years since the company first opened with a mere four
employees, Hudson Valley Tree has grown into a $25 million business
employing 800 workers year-round with factories in Newburgh and
Indiana.
   The soft-spoken Spiegel says he never dreamed of such success
when he started in 1982.
   ``I expected a good business, but I didn't think it would be this
good,'' he said during a recent interview in his office, located t
one end of the Newburgh plant.
   ``We originally thought we'd take the higher end of the market
and sell locally to department stores and nurseries,'' he said.
   But sales are many times higher than originally anticipated. And
more than half of the company's merchandise is sold outside New York
state _ to department store chains across the country, including
Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Alaska.
   Spiegel attributes his company's success to emphasis on customer
service and acceptance of the product.
   ``When I first began manufacturing trees in the early 1960s, 95
percent of the people said they'd never have an artificial tree,''
he said.
   Spiegel has been in the artificial Christmas tree business about
30 years. He was president of American Tree and Wreath,
headquartered in Mt. Vernon, Vt., until he, Squarci and two others
opened their first factory in Newburgh.
   The company outgrew that plant within three years and opened a
larger one which now employs 600.
   In March operations began at Hudson Valley Tree's plant in
Evansville, Ind. Spiegel says that plant, which employs 200, is near
most of the company's Midwest customers.
   Spiegel and Squarci designed and constructed the machinery used
in the two plants.
   ``The flow is designed for storage, raw materials, manufacturing,
warehousing and shipping,'' he said. ``Raw materials go in at one
end and finished goods come out at the other end.''
   Hudson Valley Tree manufactures and sells mostly soft-needle
trees and is test marketing some hard-needle trees. The company's
hottest seller is the artificial Douglas Fir.
   The company sells a variety of trees ranging in size from two to
25 feet high and from $40 to $300 in price. The most popular size is
six feet, which sells for about $75, Spiegel says.
   Lately there's been a strong demand for tall trees. ``People who
have big homes and big ceilings want that nice big tree,'' Spiegel
said.
   Artificial trees were first introduced in the 1950s. Roughly 3
million are sold each year, Spiegel says.
   He says most of his competition comes from Asian suppliers of
artificial trees and producers of live trees.
   The live tree business is surging again after a period of
shortages in the 1960s and '70s, according to David E. Baumann,
associate executive director of the National Christmas Tree
Association.
   Baumann says live trees were in short supply until the 1980s
because they were taken from the woods and not grown on large farms
as they are today. Now there's an adequate supply of live trees and
the competition between live and artificial suppliers is heating up.
   This year, for the first time ever, the National Christmas Tree
Association plans to spend $1 million on an advertising campaign to
promote the natural tree.
   Artificial trees are made by running rolls of green polyvinal
chloride through a slitter _ a knifelike machine _ to form the
branches.
   A number of the branches are then hand-wrapped to a metal rod to
create a ``panel'' _ a larger branch. An artificial Christmas tree
is simply a series of panels hooked on the tree's rod.
   The advantage of the artificial version: They're perfectly
shaped, shed no needles and can be stored in a closet to rise again
year after year.
   Spiegel thinks that's why artificial trees will continue to be in
demand. He says he's got much of the East Coast and Midwest covered,
and has his eyes turned to the West.
   ``We never built a sales organization on the West Coast, so it's
a growth area for us,'' he said.

   The environmental mess that has plagued
Eastman Kodak Co. for nearly a year may be more a result of emotions
and coincidences, than pollution and poisons.
   No one can say for sure.
   But the company, once considered the benevolent corporate father
who could do no wrong, has certainly suffered a major blow to its
status in its hometown.
   ``Clearly, our reputation, at least as an environmentally
responsible company, has been brought into question. And we don't
like that,'' said Ron Roberts, a company spokesman.
   The whole mess started last March when a newspaper article
disclosed that some testing by Kodak indicated that chemicals had
probably leaked from Kodak Park, the company's sprawling
manufacturing complex, into the groundwater of a neighboring
residential area.
   Wall Street analysts and others took notice, but quickly lost
interest.
   ``I think the view down here was, `Is this going to be
catastrophic? Are we talking billions or hundreds of millions of
dollars?''' said Eugene Glazer, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. ``We looked at it and the answer was no.''
   That left the issue to be hashed out in the community.
   Since the first report, rhetoric and charges have been furiously
flying in numerous public hearings and blanket media coverage. A
$200 million lawsuit has been filed against the company. A major
expansion project to produce more color film has been stalled.
   Residents of Rand Street have appeared on television news
broadcasts to detail their dizziness, headaches and unexplained nose
bleeds. They've also held news conferences and protests.
   One woman even put her pet rabbit, who died during the uproar, in
the freezer to save as possible proof that chemicals were moving out
of the ground and into her home.
   ``The way this thing was presented it sounded like Kodak was
poisoning the neighborhood,'' said Dr. Joel Nitzkin, director of the
Monore County Health Department. ``It's all been taken out of
context. There just isn't any evidence of any health hazard.''
   His department conducted studies immediately after the newspaper
report and found nothing unusual in the Rand Street neighborhood.
Many of the complaints were exaggerated or had common explanations,
like having a home that was too dry in the winter.
   Months later, the health department conducted more tests in two
schools near the manufacturing center and pronounced them safe.
   ``Yes, we found contamination, from the cleaning agents used in
the schools, nothing from Kodak,'' said Nitzkin.
   Despite these preliminary findings, the mess at Kodak has become
messier and messier.
   After months of delays, more definitive testing, which will
involve taking soil samples from several feet underground in
backyards in the neighborhood, was started this past week.
   ``We're still on the road to finding out what's going on. It's
been a long and frustrating road so far,'' said Allen Hall,
co-chairman of Concerned Neighbors of Kodak Park, a neighborhood
group formed last March.
   Hall moved out of the neighborhood three weeks ago ``because I
didn't feel safe there any more.''
   His new neighborhood, in the Rochester suburb of Greece, is
quiet, odor-free and ``there's no fly ash on the window sill.''
   The Hall family is one of about 50 who have taken advantage of a
Kodak plan that helps people sell their homes or, if they want to
stay, refinances their mortgage at an attractive rate and gives them
up to $5,000 for home improvements.
   There are about 200 homes in the neighborhood.
   Meanwhile, two other former residents of the neighborhood hired
some expert environmental attorneys and filed a lawsuit claiming
``residents of the area are in grave danger.'' They hope to persuade
state Supreme Court Justice Raymond Cornelius to grant the suit
class action status.
   On the heels of the Rand Street situation, a new federal law
required Kodak and every other company in the country that uses
chemicals to disclose how many and how much of them were being
discharged into the environment.
   When the company in July revealed that 9 million pounds of
methylene chloride were being released into the air, albeit in very
diffuse amounts, people were shocked.
   ``Any time you talk about millions of pounds of anything, it
blows peoples' minds,'' said Robert Wilson, an assistant professor
of environmental health sciences at the University of Rochester.
   But, he said, that number is nearly as frightening as it sounds
because studies on the dangers of methylene chloride are ``very
equivocal.''
   Methylene chloride, a powerful solvent that's used in paint
strippers, spray paint, and as an industrial solvent, is at the
center of this environmental controversy.
   Kodak, the largest user of the solvent in New York, uses it
around the clock as a key ingredient in the manufacture of miles and
miles of photographic film.
   Within the last 10 years, the safety of exposure to the chemical
has come under scrutiny and in 1985 the chemical was listed as a B-2
probable carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   That means that there's sufficient evidence from research in
animals to indicate that a chemical could cause cancer, but no
evidence in humans.
   In fact, the EPA used a comprehensive Kodak study of its own
workers exposed to the chemical to determine that there were no
significant increases in the incidence of cancer.
   In October, the company gathered a panel of 16 experts to review
the current information on methylene chloride and offer an opinion
on the danger of exposure to the chemical.
   ``The bottom line is that when the panel members were asked if
they would be content to live in an atmosphere that contained what
Rochester's contained, the answer was `absolutely,''' said Dr.
Marvin Kuschner, chairman of the panel and a professor of pathology
at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
   The final piece of the pollution puzzle occurred last month when,
with concerns of pollution at their height, Kodak requested a permit
to release additional methylene chloride into the air because of its
planned expansion.
   The company is challenging the state's recently revised limits on
emissions and the state has promised a ruling later this month.
   ``I don't know why all these things have happened at the same
time. I don't have the luxury to think about that,'' said Al Butkas,
chief supervisor of Kodak affairs for the state Department of
Environmental Conservation. ``It would have been a lot nicer if each
one of these things had come in separate five-year blocks, I can
tell you that.''

   Workers should maintain the buying power they
have left next year but will not recover lost ground with raises in
January, a business leader said.
   The Minimum Wage Commission begins negotiations Thursday on the
amount of the annual Jan. 1 increase.
   Both inflation and the exchange rate must be considered in
figuring the amount of the raise, Jorge Ocejo Moreno, president of
the Mexican Employers' Federation, said Saturday.
   The minimum wage has been about $3.50 a day in Mexico City since
March.
   A government anti-inflation program begun a year ago held the
increase in consumer prices to 48.6 percent for the first 11 months
of this year. The plan was announced as inflation rose to 159.2
percent for all of 1987.
   As part of the program, the peso currency, which had been
devalued daily, has been held steady.

<HEAD>Citicorp Buys Insolvent Caribank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANIA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caribank's 14 branches in South Florida will
be open for business as usual under the Citicorp name Monday morning.
   Citibank, the nation's largest bank holding company, bought the
bank Friday along with the responsibility for $15 million in red ink
stemming from bad real estate loans, state regulators said.
   Under the agreement, Citibank will purchase around $535 million
in Caribank assets and will assume $500 million in deposits. In
addition, Citicorp will inject about $50 million in capital into the
new entity, to be called Citibank (Florida) NA, which will maintain
headquarters in Dania.
   Caribank has been under close regulatory supervision since early
1986 and was ruled insolvent this year by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the state of Florida, Comptroller Gerald Lewis
said.
   ``This is a happy ending to a bad situation,'' Lewis said.
``We're pleased that Citicorp was interested in this institution,
and we hope that its future will be brighter than its past.''
   Caribank had about $507 million in assets but had suffered losses
of about $45.3 million in 1988 as of Nov. 30, said Lisa McKnight, a
spokeswoman for Lewis.
   ``The capital just wasn't there, so they became insovlent. The
severity of the problem had increased drastically,'' Ms. McKnight
said.
   Citicorp had assets of approximately $205 billion and 34 thrifts
in Florida as of June 3O.

<HEAD>Many Seeking Hotel Rooms For Super Bowl Are Told `No Room In La
Casa'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 26,000 hotel rooms in Dade and Broward
counties are already booked for the Super Bowl and people who
haven't taken steps to find lodging may soon be out of luck.
   Many fans are on waiting lists, and many of the top hotels are
asking a minimum four-day stay.
   ``No room in la casa,'' said Lisa Cole, spokeswoman for the
1,200-room Fontainebleau Hilton. ``We've been booked a solid year.''
   The story was the same at the Biscayne Bay Marriott. It has been
booked for three months, with 100 people on a waiting list, and it's
still getting 20 calls a day. The sister Marriott at Miami
International Airport is booked. So is the Marriott Harbor Beach
Resort in Fort Lauderdale.
   Other hotels that are booked include the Hyatt Regency, the Eden
Roc, the Intercontinental, the Shelborne and just about every other
major Miami area hotel, as well as the Diplomat in Hollywood, Pier
66 in Fort Lauderdale, and the Embassy Suites in Broward County,
just to name a few.
   The National Football League alone has reserved more than 10,000
rooms for teams and their families, sponsors and the media. Fans
have taken about 16,000 more.
   Analysts estimate the need by game day Jan. 22 at about 35,000
rooms.
   ``This isn't the type that drives up and down the strip looking
for a vacancy,'' said Jim Steeg, NFL director of special events and
1-year veteran Super Bowl organizer.
   One reason for the early booking may have been previous Super
Bowl experiences.
   At the last Miami Super Bowl in 1979, when the Steelers slid by
the Cowboys, 35-31, travel agents had booked many hotels solid,
leaving NFL teams and affiliates fumbling for rooms.
   ``That was sort of upsetting,'' Steeg said.
   There is hope for those still looking for rooms, however.
   Ron Kent, executive director of the Super Bowl Host Committee,
said between 6,000 and 7,000 rooms are still available in Dade and
another 4,000 to 5,000 are available in Broward.
   Kent said even more rooms will become available as fans see their
teams shot as the playoffs dwindle and opt to cancel reservations.
   And some people have gone as far as Fort Myers, across the
Florida peninsula, to secure their Super Bowl rooms.

   The U.S. dollar advanced in early trading Monday
against the Japanese yen, while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
rose slightly.
   The dollar opened at 122.70 yen, up 0.27 yen from Friday's close
of 122.43 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's rise followed its strength on the
Sydney market, which opened earlier than Tokyo.
   A dealer at a major commercial bank said the dollar was expected
to trade in a narrow range until Wednesday, when the U.S. Commerce
Department is scheduled to release the nation's trade figures for
October.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei stock average of 225
selected issues, a 34.52-point winner Friday, rose 40.35 points, or
0.13 percent, to advance to 29,833.77 shortly after the market
opened.

<HEAD>Grand Met Raises Offer for Pillsbury; Company Chairmen Meet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food giant Pillsbury Co. announced late Sunday
that suitor Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain is willing to raise
its offer for Pillsbury to as much as $66 a share from the current
$60 bid.
   A $66-a-share bid would raise the offer for Pillsbury to $5.6
billion. Grand Met had been trying to take over Pillsbury for $5.23
billion. Pillsbury has around 85.4 million shares outstanding.
   Pillsbury said in a statement that its chairman, Philip L. Smith,
had met over the weekend with Grand Met Chief Executive Officer
Allen Sheppard. The meetings did not result in any agreement between
Pillsbury and Grand Met, a major hotel and beverage conglomerate,
Pillsbury noted.
   The announcement came a day before the takeover battle is to come
to a head Monday, when a Delaware court holds hearings on
Pillsbury's anti-takeover poison pill, the cornerstone of its
defense against Grand Met.
   Last month, Minneapolis-based Pillsbury announced it would make
its Burger King Corp. a separate company, complete with its own
board of directors and newly issued stock. The spinoff would occur
Dec. 19.
   The move has been widely viewed as a last-ditch effort by
Pillsbury to fend off Grand Met.
   Then, on Dec. 2, Pillsbury announced it has agreed to sell its
Grain Merchandising Division, a chain of restaurants and a food
division.
   Pillsbury spokesman Larry Haeg denied that the sales, terms of
which were not disclosed, were made in reaction to the takeover
attempt. He added that plans to sell the Grain Merchandising
Division were announced July 25.
   Pillsbury sold the grain division to ConAgra Inc., a diversified
food company based in Omaha, Neb., with annual sales of $9.5
billion. Haeg said it was not known how much the division was worth,
but said it was part of the company's industrial foods division,
which had sales of $416 million last year.
   Pillsbury also said it was selling Bay Street, a chain of 12
seafood restaurants based in Dallas. The chain was sold to Bay
Street Restaurant Inc., a management group led by Bay Street General
Manager Alan R. Palmieri and Bill Bouffard, president of Restaurant
Capital Corp., an investment group.
   Also sold was Ashford Creameries, a division of Fiesta Foods Ltd.
of Britain, a marketer of frozen desserts and ice cream. It was sold
to London-based Hillsdown Holdings PLC.
   At an initial meeting on Friday evening, Pillsbury said, Sheppard
indicated he was prepared to increase Grand Met's offer to $63 a
share. Smith responded that he ``was not willing to discuss at this
time'' a price which was not in the range of $68 to $73 a share.
   On Saturday morning, Grand Met indicated it was making a formal
offer of $65 a share.
   Pillsbury said its board of directors met Sunday to consider the
$65-a-share proposal, but there was ``no enthusiasm'' for it.
   At a meeting on Sunday afternoon, Sheppard indicated that
although $65 was his official final offer, $66 a share ``could be
available,'' according to the statement.
   Pillsbury said its board has authorized Smith to be available for
any discussions with Grand Met officials ``which are designed to
maximize values to Pillsbury shareholders.''
   Attorneys for Grand Met have said the company would have to lower
its offer should the Burger King spinoff occur because it would
present a huge tax liability for Grand Met.
   Monday's hearing in Delaware Chancery Court is on Grand Met's
renewed motion directing Pillsbury to invalidate its ``poison pill''
defense. The pill would make a takeover prohibitively expensive. The
tender offer is conditioned on the removal of the pill.
   Dissident shareholders also have sued to have the pill
invalidated, but courts in Delaware and Minnesota have left it
intact.
