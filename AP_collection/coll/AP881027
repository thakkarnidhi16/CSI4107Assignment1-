   Faced with thickening ice, plunging
temperatures and the imminent departure of two Soviet icebreakers,
rescuers late Thursday made a last-ditch effort to free two whales
threatened again by the arctic icepack.
   The California gray whales, freed from nearly three weeks
confinement in their icebound breathing hole off Point Barrow, moved
closer to open water via man-made breathing holes and channels cut
in the ice by the Soviet ships.
   But as night fell Thursday, the whales were in the last breathing
hole cut for them, with about 300 meters of ice between the hole and
open water, said rescue coordinator Ron Morris.
   Temperatures Thursday hovered around 15 degrees below zero and
were expected to drop to minus 20 to 25 degrees below overnight,
cold enough to begin freezing over the adjoining open water of the
Arctic Ocean.
   Rescuers left a portable generator to power de-icing equipment at
the whale's last breathing hole and light a beacon for the
icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev, which was to make two or three final
runs to try to free the whales.
   ``This should free them,'' Morris said. ``Hopefully, the whales
will see the opportunity to leave. We've given them the best shot
tonight.'' Morris said the Soviets had to leave Thursday night.
   The plunging temperatures quickly refroze the channels the
icebreaker had made earlier Thursday. Eskimos broke out chain saws
and cut dozens more breathing holes leading away from the clogged
channel toward the open sea.
   By nightfall, the workers were encountering dangerously unstable
ice as a result of the icebreakers' earlier efforts.
   As they did Wednesday, the whales readily followed the path cut
for them by the Eskimos. As night fell, they had advance as far as
the last breathing hole.
   In a new tactic, rescuers carved 30 new holes Thursday in hopes
that the whales would follow the holes away from the channel and
eventually reach open water via another route the Soviet ships were
clearing.
   ``They're ready to go home'' after nearly six months at sea, said
Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. ``We felt also with the weather creeping in like
this, we had to do something tonight.''
   Everyone hopes that when daylight arrives Friday, both the
Soviets and the whales will be gone, Petersen said.
   NOAA ice analyst Gary Huffard said the open water was definitely
beginning to freeze, but he remained optimistic that the whales
could escape if they could get beyond the edge of the pressure ridge
battered down by the icebreakers earlier in the week.
   Eskimos with chain saws had cut a series of breathing holes that
allowed the whales to swim well away from the original hole to which
they had been confined.
   The whales grew accustomed to the cutting and during a frenzy of
work Wednesday, in which 50 new holes were cut, the whales
repeatedly surfaced in the new holes before the last block of ice
was removed.
   Since the whales were accustomed to the noise of the saws, that
sound might be used to coax them forward toward open water, said
Morris, a biologist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   The Eskimos eventually worked the marine mammals to within a
quarter-mile of a channel carved through the 18-inch-thick ice by
two Soviet icebreakers late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Then the
icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev reopened the partially frozen channel.
   The man-made channel, aimed at guiding the whales to an natural
open ``lead'' through the ice and eventually to open water,
partially refroze during the night, Morris said.
   He said the whales were ``conditioning themselves back to
reality'' after nearly three weeks of confinement in the ice off the
coast near Point Barrow.
   He also announced a crackdown on access to the whales by
reporters and others. He said pilots entering restricted air space
over the whales were subject to fines of $25,000.
   A biologist for the North Slope Borough, Geoff Carroll, said
Thursday that the whales continued to appear healthy.
   The fate of the whales may never be known. Scientists involved in
the rescue that cost more than $800,000 didn't attach radio
transmitters to the whales to track them, in part because of concern
that the devices would only add to their stress, said federal marine
mammal biologist Jim Harvey.
   A whale that was trapped with the pair nearly three weeks ago
apparently died last week.
   The endangered California gray whales have one of the longest
migration routes of all mammals, 6,000 to 8,000 miles from summer
feeding grounds in the Arctic to the warm water off Baja California.
   Their population has risen to about 20,000, growing at an annual
average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, officials said.

   One millionaire said he is sure he will go to
heaven when he dies but another thinks death really is the end.
   A third thinks of heaven as eternally watching cricket.
   The thoughts emerged in a new book today, ``My God,'' compiled by
actress Hayley Mills and rock music manager Marcus Maclaine. They
asked famous people for their personal concept of God and what
happens when they die.
   Succinct replies came from novelist Kingsley Amis and Royal Opera
House general director Jeremy Isaacs. They answered ``None'' and
``Nothing.''
   Lord Forte, millionaire hotel owner and caterer, was more
optimistic.
   ``I am certain that Heaven _ and I am confident I will not be
sent elsewhere _ will be a beautiful place, but I have no fixed
conception of what it will be like. I am prepared to be pleasantly
surprised,'' he said.
   Musician Paul McCartney, the former Beatle and also very rich,
thought God was a shortenened version of good and that ``When you
die you conk out.''
   Yoko Ono, widow of murdered Beatle John Lennon, said: ``God is
the unknown power which is within. Death is a transition.''
   Author-scientist Arthur C. Clarke doesn't believe in God but
added, ``I'm very interested in him.''
   Astrologer Patric Walker replied: ``All I know for sure about God
is that it isn't me.''
   Jeffrey Archer, the best-selling novelist, said he had no idea
what would happen to him after death, but hoped he would find
himself on top of the pavilion at Lord's cricket ground in London
watching the game.
   Bill Jordan, president of the 850,000-member Amalgamated
Engineering Union, replied: ``I only pray that when I die there will
be no pickets at the Pearly Gates, only a sign saying `Vacancies,
apply within.'''

   French vacationers returning from Egypt had to pass
the hat for gas money after the pilot of their DC-9 made an
unscheduled refueling stop in southern Italy, the national daily La
Repubblica reported.
   The crew of the North African Airlines jet decided to forego a
scheduled refueling stop in Athens on Saturday and land instead in
Brindisi, despite the fact that the airline had no refueling
facilities or service account there, the report said.
   Crew members discovered upon landing that airport officials in
Brindisi would not accept credit cards as payment for fuel. They
then realized that they were a little short on cash.
   As the plane sat on the runway, the passengers gradually realized
the situation and, reluctantly, began to gather money among
themselves, La Repubblica said.
   Wednesday's report did not say how much money was needed to pay
for the refueling.

   What could easily be one of only operas ever
performed in ancient langauge of the Aztecs will be staged at the
Pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico.
   Tenor Placido Domingo, singing in Nauhatl, will star in the
premiere of Lalo Schifrin's ``Songs of the Aztecs'' on the stone
stage of the Square of the Moon, built centuries ago by ancient
Meso-Americans.
   Schifrin will conduct the Mexico Philharmonic at the Oct. 29
event, a benefit to launch a campaign for the restoration of the
Aztec Temple of Teotihuacan, an hour's drive from Mexico City.
American Express has pledged $100,000 toward the restoration.
   The composer said doing an opera in Nauhatl was not a serious
problem. ``The chorus and singers are used to the phonetics of a
foreign language,'' he said.
   ``I thought it would be better to do it in the original language.
With a translation, the use of a dictionary and grammar, I was able
to work it out. Chocolatl was a secret drink of the Aztecs. We say
chocolate. Our word coyote comes from their coyotetl.''
   He was helped by a Nauhatl authority, Dr. Georges Beaudo of the
University of Toulouse in France.
   Schifrin wrote the music after finding some pre-Columbian poetry,
in Spanish, by Nezahualcoyotl (1432-72).
   ``(It) was so beautiful I decided to use it,'' he said. ``The
last line of the poem is, `It cannot be in vain why we come to this
Earth; let us leave some flowers; let us leave some songs.'''
   For the Oct. 29 performance, 10,000 chairs will be set up, a new
sound system built and TV screens put in to provide subtitles in
Spanish and English. ``We're trying to make some of the prices very
popular,'' he said. ``A thousand people are going to pay very, very
high prices. I cannot tell you how much money it takes to preseve
something that is very important. ... To know where we're coming
from is going to help us to know where we're going.''
   The pyramids at Teotihuacan date from 100 B.C. to 100 A.D.
   The site of the concert, Schifrin said, is in the City of the
Gods in a square of stone, the Square of the Moon.
   ``The square is raised; it's exactly the place for the full
symphony, full chorus, soloists and conductor, where musicians used
to play 500 years ago,'' he said. ``It was a stage; they built it
for us. Along a stone avenue are ruins of temples and stairways. The
whole place looks very impressive. We go to Greece and Rome to find
architectural riches but we have it right here.''
   That Schifrin is the composer of so esoteric a work may surprise
those who know him either from his jazz days with Dizzy Gillespie or
as a composer of more than 80 film and TV scores.
   Schifrin, who is 56, was born in Buenos Aires, where his father
was concertmaster of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic. He studied
composition and piano at the Paris Conservatory, and returned to
Buenos Aires where he became a composer, arranger, conductor and
pianist, in pop, jazz and classical music.
   ``I've seen opera since I was a child. I had a dramatic instinct.
This is probably one of the first times I'm saying this openly but I
think movies are the opera of today,'' he said.
   ``In `The Cincinnati Kid,' where I had Ray Charles playing along
with a symphony orchestra, it was not pop music. This was really
serious music _ to me, and I think to many people.
   ``The score of `Bullitt' is being played by symphony orchestras
now. I did an arrangement of symphonic sketches from the score of
`Cool Hand Luke.'''
   He moved to the United States in 1958 and played piano in
Gillespie's quintet from 1960-62. He composed ``Gillespiana Suite''
for the first record he on which he played with Dizzy.
   ``Many people think I went to Hollywood to make money,'' she
said. ``I didn't have any idea about how much money I was going to
make. There is a group of composers in New York and there is no
outlet to play their music. Duke Ellington was the only example
since Haydn to have his own orchestra to play his own music. The
reason I went to Hollywood was, there was an outlet for hearing your
music you composed.''
   Lately, he has done less film composing and more conducting. Last
December, he became music director of the Paris Philharmonic. Their
first recording together, Ravel's ``Mother Goose,'' Stravinsky's
``Petrushka'' and Schifrin's double bass concerto with soloist Gary
Karr, is being released this fall.
   ``I think music is to be shared, and not only through mechanical
means like records. You can be in a theater or even a stadium, doing
something for several thousand people. That is very thrilling.''

   He's punched out the Penguin, wrestled the
Riddler and crushed the Catwoman. But after 48 years of
crime-busting, Robin _ yes, the Boy Wonder, Batman's earnest if
excitable teen-age sidekick _ has been blown to bits by the Joker.
   Death comes next week for Robin when DC Comics distributes Batman
issue No. 428, the third installment of the four-part ``A Death in
the Family,'' in which the younger half of the Dynamic Duo is
dynamited by the clown prince of crime.
   ``It was very odd. I realize all this stuff is made up, but
everybody here felt like the family of an accident victim, waiting
for the doctor to come out and say, `There's still hope,''' said
Dennis O'Neil, editor of the Batman series.
   The Joker, by the way, is doing more than undermining the quality
of life in Gotham City these days; his incendiary eradication of
Robin comes under his duties as Iran's new ambassador to the United
Nations.
   But it won't be the Joker, Batman creator Bob Kane, or O'Neil
facing murder charges for the killing of Robin _ it's the readers of
the Batman comics who voted in a phone-in poll to off the teen
superhero born in 1940.
   A 900 number was set up on Sept. 15-16 by DC to allow fans to
phone in the fate of Robin, who _ in case you have forgotten _ is
the ward of Gotham City millionaire Bruce Wayne. It was the first
time DC has allowed its readers to decide a character's future, said
O'Neil, who also killed off Batgirl in the late 1960s.
   The final totals: 5,343 for the death penalty, 5,271 against.
   Oooof!
   There is some good news. The dead Robin is NOT Dick Grayson, the
original Robin and Batman's campy cohort on the television program;
Grayson split with the Caped Crusader in 1984, grabbed a new costume
and became Nightwing, head of a new crime-fighting team published
under the title ``The New Teen Titans,'' DC said.
   The not-so-dearly departed Robin was Jason Todd, a kid off the
streets who became Wayne's new ward and the readers' new whipping
boy. Angry letters to the editor labeled Robin II ``a vindictive,
vengeful little brat'' and ``a wimp;'' another letter urged the
editors to ``waste him.''
   The editors, with the approval of the fans, did just that. O'Neil
promises Robin won't be coming back; the comics, unlike television's
``Dallas,'' will not take the easy way out, he promised.
   ``We're not going to pull a Bobby Ewing. There will be no dream
sequence,'' said O'Neil. ``He's dead. He's gone.''

<TEXT>
   Turbaned peasants trudge by, prodding water
buffalo and lugging firewood, and taking little notice of the
towering hollow structure from another time and for another universe.
   Surrounded by green mountains in an isolated corner of Sichuan
province, the Xichang Satellite Center and its 11-story gantry is
the takeoff point for China's entry into the international satellite
launching market.
   The base, normally closed to foreigners, is on display as China
enters final negotiations with Washington on issuing U.S. licenses
for the launch of three Hughes Aircraft Co. satellites. They would
be the first American satellites put into orbit by a non-Western
country.
   Agreement has been reached on safeguarding U.S. technology
secrets during the launch process and establishing China's liability
in case of accident.
   Officials meet again in November to work out how to ensure that
Chinese prices, much lower than those charged by the U.S. space
shuttle or European Ariane services, won't jeopardize the American
commercial launching industry.
   Xichang's first commercial venture could come as early as 1989
with the launch of Westar 6, an old satellite retrieved by the space
shuttle in 1984, for AsiaSat, a Hong Kong consortium.
   An Australian company, AUSSAT, intends to put two Hughes
communications satellites into orbit in the early 1990s.
   China decided in the mid-1970s to build a rocket base in this
remote area because it is easy to defend, sparsely populated and has
clear winter days well suited for launches.
   But while the base is part of China's march to the 21st century,
it is surrounded by reminders of the Middle Ages.
   The site is 40 miles north of Xichang, a small town accessible
from the provincial capital of Chengdu by twice-a-week airplane
flights or a 12-hour train ride.
   On the road from Xichang, women wash clothes in streams, water
buffalo pull wooden plows through rice paddies, and barefoot
children scamper around mud-baked houses. Farmers spread their grain
on the road so truck wheels can help grind it.
   Between launches, the base looks abandoned.
   The site, run by the People's Liberation Army, employs 1,200, but
new buildings to house the 141-foot Long March III rockets and
satellites during pre-launch testing are almost empty.
   Windows in the gantry blown out during the last launch in March
have yet to be replaced.
   About four miles from the launch pad, only two engineers sat at
monitors in the gymnasium-like control center. A smaller control
center, built into the mountains at the launch site, was not shown
to visitors.
   Site officials say the simplicity of the operation is a main
reason for its competitive prices and high success rate. China
reportedly can undercut space shuttle or Ariane prices by as much as
30 percent.
   Tong Lianjie, deputy director of the center, said the price
advantage is ``mainly because our launching facilities are simple,
reliable and practical.''
   He said the equipment, all produced in China, is relatively cheap
and ``technical personnel in China have fairly low salaries. We will
not seek a high profit, although of course we will seek a profit.''
   Tong gave assurances China will not pose a threat to other
satellite services. ``Because of the limited number of launches, we
can't be that competitive in the international market.''
   Center officials said military control over China's space program
is another reason for its successes. Since 1970, when China became
the fifth nation after the Soviet Union, the United States, France
and Japan to launch a satellite with its own carrier rocket, it has
had 23 successful launches and one failure.
   ``Military discipline is better than that of civilians, who spend
half the time smoking cigarettes and the other half working,'' said
Wang Yongde, deputy director of the center.
   China's space program, overseen by the Ministry of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, is concentrating on building a more powerful
version of the Long March III and adding a second launch pad at
Xichang by early 1990. This will give China the ability to put a
payload of up to 8.8 tons in orbit, compared with 1.4 tons at
present and 12 tons for the space shuttle.
   China has had feelers about its launching services from more than
a dozen countries and has signed an agreement with Brazil for future
joint development of satellites for the study of Earth.

<TEXT>
   A cartoon shows a government
soldier facing a guerrilla. Each holds an assault rifle, but piled
on the soldier's bent back are a U.S. military adviser, a human
rights monitor, and papers documenting rights abuses.
   The guerrilla stands tall, unencumbered.
   The drawing in the office of Col. Mauricio Vargas, chief of
operations for the joint chiefs of staff, illustrates how human
rights are considered a burden by many Salvadoran officers.
   Interviews with soldiers, diplomats and judicial authorities
suggest that only U.S. pressure and fear of losing U.S. aid keep the
army in line.
   Abuses by the armed forces are far fewer than in the early 1980s,
when death squads were killing hundreds of people every month, but
two peasant massacres and a gang rape in recent weeks have raised
concern.
   Amnesty International said Wednesday that hundreds of suspected
government opponents have been killed in the past two years by death
squads, usually made up of troops and police.
   ``We're only at the beginning of a long road toward respect for
human rights, obviously not at the end of it,'' said Judge Rene
Zelaya, who is handling the rape case.
   The increased death squad activity comes with President Jose
Napoleon Duarte suffering from cancer and leftist leaders
re-entering the country after guerrillas agreed to let their
political groups participate in a March 1989 presidential election.
   Duarte, a centrist, has vigorously opposed death squad activity;
leftists who fled because they feared for their lives said they felt
they could return because death squad activity was down.
   At the same time, politically motivated slayings by leftist
guerrillas have reportedly increased.
   El Salvador has received more than $3 billion in U.S. economic
and military aid this decade, more than any country in the Western
Hemisphere, but U.S. lawmakers have said continued aid depends on
growing respect for civil liberties.
   Officers and troops are not afraid to say they see respect for
human rights as a burden.
   ``It limits our action,'' said Lt. Ali Valdez of the elite Arce
Batallion during a recent patrol of guerrilla-dominated hills in
northern Morazan province.
   Cpl. Jose Antonio Lopez said thousands of civilians killed by
death squads in the early 1980s ``deserved what they got.''
   Paratrooper Sgt. Mauricio Orellana said he favored ``the 1932
solution'' to defeat leftist guerrillas at war with the U.S.-backed
government. He was referring to the slaying, by forces of
then-dictator Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez, of up to 20,000
peasants to quell a rebellion by a few hundred against landowners.
   One recent massacre took place Sept. 21, when soldiers detained
most of the residents of the hamlet of San Francisco and accused
them of collaborating with rebels.
   The soldiers took seven men and three women to a ravine, tied
them up and killed them with grenades and rifle fire, according to
neighbors and relatives of the dead.
   Seven were shot in the head from less than six inches away, an
autopsy showed. A judge issued arrest warrants for four soldiers,
but none has been handed over to judicial authorities.
   Human rights groups said they feared the investigation into the
massacre _ the first mass killing of civilians in four years _ would
make ordinary soldiers scapegoats and not focus on the responsible
officers.
   Americas Watch, a private organization that monitors rights in
the Western Hemisphere, issued a report on El Salvador on Oct. 2.
   It said killings declined between 1984 and late 1987 before
rising again and notes that no Salvadoran officer or death squad
member has been prosecuted and punished for a human rights violation.
   Amnesty International said dumped bodies frequently are found
decapitated, dismembered, strangled or showing marks of rape or
torture, such as burns and machete wounds.
   Amnesty International said death squads intimidate government
opponents by publishing ``death lists'' in newspaper advertisements
and delivering coffins to the homes of intended victims.
   Zelaya has been handling the case of a 20-year-old who says she
was raped by 13 soldiers in the town of Apastepeque.
   Zelaya asked the commander of the cavalry regiment whose soldiers
allegedly raped the woman for the names of the men on duty the day
of the attack. He received no response.
   In the most recent incident, several men in army uniforms arrived
the night of Oct. 14 in the hamlet of Tres Ceibas, 11 miles north of
San Salvador, and pulled four young men from their homes.
   Minutes later, several shots were heard. Relatives found the
bodies of the four, shot in the head, about 40 yards away.
   Rights groups blamed the army. The armed forces said the killers
were guerrillas masquerading as soldiers.
   The Roman Catholic Church's Legal Aid Office has noted a sharp
rise in politically motivated slayings of civilians this year.
Execution-style killings of civilians by the rebels are likewise up
sharply.
   However, the guerrillas usually take responsibility for such
slayings, which they call ``bringing to justice.''

<TEXT>
   The popularity of occultism,
including devil worship, is growing among West Germany's young, and
a newspaper said some even engage in the practices during breaks at
school.
   Parents, public officials and church leaders say 10,000
teen-agers may be involved in occult practices ranging from seances
to ``black sabbaths'' in which animals are sacrificed at cemeteries.
   A front-page report Oct. 8 in the influential Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung carried the headline, ``The Occult Is Spreading
in Our Schools.''
   It cited instances of pupils using breaks between classes for
occult practices and said: ``Participants withdraw from other
teen-agers. Their thoughts constantly revolve around the puzzling
world of the spirits.''
   In September, a meeting of the national parents' council issued a
statement declaring: ``The rise of occultism and magic practices
(among pupils) indicates spiritual and psychological deficits in our
society.''
   Hans-Joachim Neuser, spokesman for the North-Rhine Westphalia
state culture ministry, said: ``Teens are using occult beliefs as
they would a drug. This is more than just an individual case or a
passing fad.''
   He said officials the number of reports from schools was growing,
especially from religion teachers.
   ``Often the pupils themselves get scared they might have gone too
far in their occult practices and turn to their religion teachers
for help,'' Neuser told The Associated Press by telephone. Religion
is a subject in most West German public schools.
   Occult practices among teen-agers ``range from experimentation
with pendulums or glasses to devil-worship ceremonies calling for
animal sacrifice,'' Neuser said.
   The first practice mentioned involves calling on spirits to guide
a dangling pendulum to letters or words placed beneath it. In other
ceremonies, spirits of deceased friends or relatives are asked to
move a glass, coins, or a table in response to certain questions.
   Among factors blamed for the turn to occultism are youth
unemployment, broken homes and pessimism about the future.
   Two teen-age members of a group practicing devil worship were
convicted of murder by a Muenster regional court in October 1987.
They slit the wrists and throat of another cult member in what was
to be a group suicide.
   Youngsters killed a cat during a ``black sabbath'' at a Dortmund
cemetery and ripped out its intestines, the Hamburg newspaper Welt
am Sonntag reported on Feb. 21.
   Spiegel, the weekly news magazine, published a photograph Oct.
12, 1987, of a note it said was written by a ninth-grader in
Lahnstein and intercepted by her teacher.
   ``I asked Lucifer yesterday who is possessed by the devil,'' it
said, and listed the names of 11 other pupils, the magazine reported.
   The Rev. Walter Schmidt of the Lutheran Central Organization for
World Views in Stuttgart said: ``At least 10,000 teen-agers are
involved to one degree or another in various occult practices,''
   A Lutheran pastor in Stuttgart, the Rev. Hans-Juergen Ruppert,
said teen-age adherence to traditional religions is declining in
concert with occultism's rise.
   ``Teens are in increasing numbers turning away from traditional
religion and turning to the occult as a replacement,'' he said. ``We
have to increase contact with them through church youth groups and
by strengthening their bonds to religion. The danger is that these
children may continue drifting away from society.''
   Neuser expressed fear of a deeper effect:
   ``This involvement happens while the youngster is still forming a
sense of values and responsibility. If distant powers are supposedly
controlling his behavior, he never has to take responsibility for
his actions.''

   In the Ultra Orthodox neighborhood of Mea
Shearim, a bearded man in a black coat and hat used a stick to rip
down a political poster, prompting an angry outburst from a
passer-by.
   ``I don't mind campaign posters, but this is a personal attack,''
explained Rabbi Mordechai Shlesinger as he tore down the poster,
which attacked a rabbi aligned with the Agudat Yisrael party.
   The incident reflects increasing tensions in the campaign leading
up to Tuesday's elections, especially among religious parties whose
swing votes may determine the next prime minister.
   The campaign in religious areas has been marked by telephone
threats and vandalism, including swastikas painted on walls.
   Apart from the religious tensions, Labor Party leader Shimon
Peres has been doused with water and targeted by stone-throwers.
Nine hecklers were arrested for blocking Peres' car on Tuesday.
   Religious parties are expected to control 13 to 15 pivotal seats
in the 120-seat parliament, or Knesset.
   If election results between the big parties are as close as
expected, both Peres's left-of-center Labor and Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud Bloc will court the religious parties to try to
form a ruling coalition.
   This will give the religious parties influence far beyond their
numbers, especially in legislation touching on education and social
affairs.
   Balconies, doors and walls are covered with colorful campaign
symbols and posters in the normally staid Mea Shearim neighborhood
of Jerusalem and in the religious town of Bnai Brak, near Tel Aviv.
   But some of the writing on the rough, ochre walls is threatening:
``Death to the leftists,'' says one. Another slogan warns a leading
politicians, ``Your blood will be spilled.''
   The issues in Mea Shearim are distinctly different from the war
and peace questions being debated by Labor and Likud.
   On one wall, a swastika was placed next to the name of the
Citizens Rights Movement, a liberal party with a strong stand
against religious coercion such as the forced closing of theaters on
the Sabbath.
   ``Murder the pathologists and archaeologists,'' said one scrawl,
underscoring Ultra Orthodox demands to ban autopsies and prevent
archaeological digs near cemeteries.
   The issue pits Agudat Yisrael, which holds two parliament seats,
against a splinter group, Degel HaTorah.
   Agudat Yisrael accused its opponents of sending hit squads to
vandalize property and attack Agudat followers. The independent
Nation newspaper said the squads consisted of men with sticks and
metal bars.
   Moshe Ravitz, a spokesman for Degel HaTorah, denied the
allegations. ``We tell our people not to hit back, even if they get
blows,'' he said.
   In television ads, religious parties have stressed the need for
more financial support to yeshiva seminaries and attacked social
permissiveness they say has led to drug problems.
   Religiously observant voters account for about 20 percent of the
2.9 million eligible voters, and most of their political factions
have drifted to the right in recent years. But leaders do not rule
out a deal with Labor.
   ``Likud is closer to our views, but I don't say now that Labor
can't change this,'' Rabbi Moshe Zeev Feldman, leader of the Agudat
Yisrael.
   Labor members have been resistant to Orthodox demands for Sabbath
observance and legislation outlawing non-Orthodox conversions.
   But Feldman said in an interview in his Bnai Brak apartment that
it was ``very important that the country should at least publicly
maintain an appearance of Judaism'' by observing religious law.
   The only liberal religious party is the Meimad, a new group that
broke away from the larger National Religious Party.
   Chaim Rippel, a Meimad candidate for parliament, said his party
would try to heal the rift between religious and secular Jews.
   The party's views on the future of the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip are close to those of Labor. ``Although we believe that
the land of Israel belongs to us, we are willing to make territorial
concessions for peace,'' he said.

   Yves Saint Laurent played it safe with streamlined
classics in his ready-to-wear show for next summer.
   Short and edited down to essentials, the show Wednesday was a
relief after other presentations that dragged out a hundred ways to
create draped, flowered sheaths for a sex kitten.
   Saint Laurent's fashion statement was short and pithy. And the
clothes often looked like simpler versions of his last couture
collection, just as deftly cut in their own way.
   In day wear, he led off with mariner-inspired suits _ in navy or
white broadcloth pants or skirts just above the knee _ with a
slightly fitted battle jacket or fitted blazer, both with brass
buttons, and topped with jaunty sailors berets.
   Saint Laurent kept to his favorite shaped shoulders and short
skirts, though he also dropped some hemlines in fluid, flared or
pleated skirts to below the knee and longer _ to midcalf length in
some pretty white belted sundresses with circular skirts.
   Saint Laurent's silk jersey sheath just barely caressed the body.
In tiny stripes, it was crisscrossed by diagonal buttoned piping. A
perfect little navy pleated dress with a white collar and bow could
not have been simpler, yet had the master's touch.
   Saint Laurent did not go in for the pyramidal trouser line
sweeping Paris, but kept his pants long and straight in suits or
narrow and cropped, matador style. For this peppy new line, he
teamed the cropped pants with fitted jackets that had big puffy
sleeves in colors like bright yellow and turquoise damasked cotton
pique.
   With few exceptions, the color themes were played in a low key.
Black, navy and white took precedence, with autumnal hues of beige,
khaki and ochre not far behind. Jazzy colors popped up in bicolored
suits in shades of turquoise, lime or corn yellow. The one flame red
cotton poplin dress with balloon sleeves was a standout among all
the sober clothes.
   There's good news for those who can't afford Saint Laurent
couture: In ready-to-wear, he offered an excellent version of the
tuxedo dress he did in 20 different ways for couture. Less
successful but still fun was the bright bicolored suit with
grape-bunch embroidery on shoulders and pockets, and even striated
grape-shaped buttons.
   Catching the mood of the times, Saint Laurent concentrated on
simple crepe de chine dinner dresses rather than
rhinestone-encrusted ball gowns loaded with flounces, frou-frou and
lace. Short kimono-wrapped silk dresses or variations on the
shirtwaist in silk had a kind of studied throwaway simplicity.
   For a finale, there were gold-belted draped white crepe gowns.
The show left some in the audience hungry for more, but there was
nothing extraneous. Everything in this understated collection was
wearable and chic.

   Equipped with a gun, a nightstick and a
regulation-size teddy bear, police officers in this town boast
they're ready for any emergency.
   The idea of driving around with stuffed animals may not inspire a
new television series _ ``T.J. Teddy''? _ but Tewksbury police
officers are receptive to the the idea if it means helping children
deal with traumatic events.
   ``When you've got a little kid who has been in an accident and
who is hysterical, it's a good idea,'' said Officer Donald Ryan.
However, he added, the bears ``will stay in the trunk.''
   The town's 13 police cars are equipped with two regulation,
7-inch teddy bears apiece.
   Police say the bears' first week on duty already has produced
positive results.
   ``It calms the kids down a lot and creates a good feeling towards
the police, too,'' said Deputy Police Chief Denise Rosen. ``A
lieutenant gave one to a child of a mother being interviewed
concerning some domestic problems at her house.''
   The bears were donated to the force by the New England Telephone
Pioneers, a charitable group whose members are current and retired
phone company employees. The police department calls the group when
a bear is given to a child so it can be replaced.

   It was love at first sight for Nathan Symons
and Martha Glasgow _ or rather, love at second sight, 60 years later.
   ``We knew almost immediately, as soon as we saw each other, that
we would always be together,'' said Mrs. Glasgow, 75, who became
Mrs. Symons in a small wedding Tuesday here.
   The two were raised in Pittsburgh and became childhood
sweethearts, but ``we just broke up and went our separate ways'' six
decades ago, said Mrs. Symons.
   They both married and raised families before being widowed. They
were reunited when Mrs. Symons' sister, Mildred Armstrong, played
matchmaker recently and invited Symons to visit.
   ``It's just been wonderful,'' said Mrs. Armstrong. ``I never saw
two people more happy together.''
   Symons, 77, of Pittsburgh, said his new wife has changed slightly
``for the better.'' But when he recently saw her after the long
separation, ``it was just like it was 60 years ago.''
   ``He hasn't changed a bit, not one bit,'' the bride said.

   Thieves stole 25 pumpkins from Ion and
Kate Tharp, but the couple made out like bandits after receiving 32
pumpkins from sympathetic zoo workers and others from anonymous
donors.
   ``Halloween is supposed to be a time of fun for children,'' said
Derek Cohn, a volunteer at Binder Park Zoo who helped arrange the
delivery. ``Stolen pumpkins aren't fun.''
   The Pennfield Township couple had arranged the 25 pumpkins on
their front porch and yard to surprise two of their grandchildren,
who arrived Wednesday for a two-week visit. The Tharps awoke Sunday
to find the pumpkins stolen.
   The pumpkin pilferage was reported locally the next day, and
donations soon followed.
   Two staffers from the zoo, which had stockpiled about 1,100
pumpkins for a Halloween event billed as the Great Zoo Boo,
delivered 32 pumpkins to the Tharps on Tuesday night.
   ``It's nice to know that there's a lot of good people out
there,'' Mrs. Tharp said.

<HEAD>Reagan Pushing On-Site Inspection Plan For START Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan is seeking agreement from
Moscow on an on-site inspection proposal his administration says
will make a strategic arms reduction treaty verifiable while
shielding ``legitimate U.S. secrets and interests.''
   State Department Spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday that the
president recently made a number of verification-related decisions,
``including some on the approach we will take to so-called suspect
site inspections.''
   But he declined to spell out details while the U.S.-Soviet arms
reduction talks are continuing in Geneva. The two sides are seeking
to work out 50 percent cuts in their arsenals of strategic, or
intercontinental, nuclear weapons.
   Redman said that while ``considerable progress'' has been made at
the Geneva talks, ``much still remains to be done.''
   ``Our intention in the START talks is to flesh out the details of
our position, including the details of a START verification regime,
so that there will be a complete U.S. position on the table in
Geneva,'' he said.
   ``START will have the most extensive verification regime in
history, well beyond that of the verification measures of the INF
(Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) treaty.''
   Redman added that ``We are convinced that these provisions will
make the treaty effectively verifiable. At the same time, we must be
careful to protect legitimate U.S. secrets and interests. ... We
believe the proper balance has been made between those two
considerations.''
   Redman also said the United States has completed its negotiating
position on space-based defenses with proposals intended to
``complement our initiative to permit the development, testing and
deployment of all space-based sensors ...''
   ``This element does not represent any change in longstanding U.S.
policy on the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty and its proper
interpretation,'' he said, adding that administration policy on the
conduct of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as worked out with
Congress, also is unchanged.
   ``Testing of space-based components, which is permitted by the
ABM Treaty, does not represent deployment of such components,''
Redman said and added: ``U.S. policy remains that we will not accept
any restrictions on SDI beyond those of the ABM Treaty.''

   The Old Glory hanging in the City Council
chambers was so old it had only 48 stars.
   Mayor Justus Dobesh said Tuesday he bought a new flag after he
noticed the red, white and blue in the old one had turned gray and
yellow.
   He said it was easier to buy the flag himself than to try
including it in the city's budget.
   ``All the years I've served on the council, I just thought this
was a small contribution I could make,'' said Dobesh, who has been
on the council for 13 years.
   When city officials removed the flag, they found it had only 48
stars, said city finance director Wendell Wessels. But no one knows
when the old flag was bought.

<HEAD>Weather Service Facing Cuts Due To Budget Squeeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A money shortage is threatening the National
Weather Service less than a month into the government's new fiscal
year, although officials say no decision has been made on whether to
close offices.
   An employee union said Wednesday it had obtained information from
the Commerce Department, parent agency of the weather service,
indicating that as many as 40 weather offices could be in jeopardy.
   Weather Service spokesman Donald Witten confirmed that the agency
is facing financial problems and said many options are being
considered for saving money. He said no decisions have been made on
any closings.
   A recently approved pay raise for federal workers, coupled with
budget cutbacks, is expected to leave the weather service about $25
million short of its needs for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1.
   ``Basically, we're looking at the operation and seeing what we
can do to meet that shortfall,'' Witten said in a telephone
interview.
   ``Obviously the sooner you do it in the fiscal year the better,
but the fact is we haven't decided on any specific reductions at
this time. We're looking at a lot of options,'' he said.
   Witten said the Weather Service has instituted a hiring freeze
and is considering offering early retirement to employees who may be
eligible to leave before the normal retirement age, as immediate
ways to save money. Salaries are by far the largest item in the
agency's budget.
   The National Weather Service Employees Organization issued a
statement claiming that plans have been drafted to close as many as
40 of the 191 weather offices.
   Such a series of closings could have a serious impact on
forecasting, particularly affecting airline operations, the group
said.
   The Weather Service offices collect hourly observations, which
are transmitted to the National Meteorological Center in Suitland,
Md., where a national forecast is developed. That is then sent to
local forecast offices, which use it along with their local
observations to issue local weather forecasts and alerts.
   This is not the first time Weather Service offices have been
threatened with closings in efforts to save money. Each time,
however, Congress has voted money to keep the offices open.
   Among the weather data collection offices that may be threatened,
according to the employees group, are:
   Eastern region: Mansfield, Ohio; Elkins, W.Va.; Reading, Pa.;
Lynchburg, Va.; Parkersburg, W.Va.
   Central region: Alamosa, Colo.; Dubuque, Iowa; Aberdeen, S.D.; La
Crosse, Wis.; Sheridan, Wyo.; Valentine, Neb.; Houghton Lake, Mich.;
Fort Wayne, Ind.; Rockford, Ill.; Springfield, Ill.; Peoria, Ill.;
Cairo, Ill.
   Southern region: Fort Myers, Fla.; Alexandria, La.; Clayton,
N.M.; Roswell, N.M.
   Western region: Flagstaff, Ariz.; Bakersfield, Calif.; Bishop,
Calif.; Santa Maria, Calif.; Stockton, Calif.; Lewiston, Idaho;
Havre, Mont.; Walla Walla, Wash.; Milford, Utah; Burna, Ore.;
Klamath Falls, Ore.
   Pacific region: Kahului, Hawaii.
   Alaska region: Barter Island, Alaska; Homer, Alaska.
   In addition, the employee association said there was the
possibility that the Juneau, Alaska, forecast office would be
downgraded and that hours would be reduced at offices in Flint and
Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secret Stealth bomber isn't even scheduled
to be publicly unveiled until next month, but it already has become
a target for critics who say it isn't needed and may not work.
   The latest complaints were raised in a report Wednesday by the
Federation of American Scientists, a private group which in the past
has been sharply critical of Reagan administration arms control
policies and defense decisions.
   ``There is no role for the B-2,'' the report said, using the
formal name of the plane designed as a ``flying wing'' and made of
high-tech materials that make the plane difficult to detect on radar.
   ``We should probably use the first B-2 prototype to gain some
practical experience with this novel military technology, but there
seems little reason to proceed now with the production of this
bomber,'' it said.
   The Pentagon is scheduled to unveiled the bomber publicly Nov. 22
at the Northrop plant in Palmdale, Calif. Thus far, the Air Force
has only released an artist's drawing.
   Congressional critics have raised questions about the plane's
future, particularly as cost estimates have increased. Both the
Senate and House Armed Services Committees have backed the planes,
but the two Democratic-controlled panels have also asked the Air
Force to justify rising costs and assure Congress that technical
problems can be solved.
   The Air Force is tentatively planning to buy 132 of the planes.
The first estimates in 1981 were that the fleet would cost about $22
billion, but the figure rose to $43 billion by 1987 and the General
Accounting Office now estimates that 132 B-2s will cost $68.8
billion. That would make the B-2 the most expensive weapon system
ever built.
   Production is tentatively scheduled to begin early next year. The
B-2, along with the B-1 bomber, is intended to replace the aging
B-52 as the newest components of the U.S. three-pronged nuclear
deterrent, which also includes submarine-launched missiles and
land-based missiles such as the MX.
   The report by the Federation of American Scientists said, ``The
secrecy surrounding this project, intended to protect technological
secrets from the Soviets, is also hiding an expensive project of
dubious merits from Americans.''
   Air Force officials, when asked for comment, said they had not
yet seen the FAS report.
   The FAS noted that ``two missions for the B-2 have emerged from
the veil of secrecy.''
   ``Some argue that the B-2 is needed to offset improvements in
Soviet air defenses. ... Others argue that the B-2 is needed in
order to attack Soviet mobile missiles such as the SS-24 and SS-25.
Neither of these arguments in favor of the B-2 is particularly
compelling,'' it said.
   The Soviets are likely to upgrade their air defenses, but even
when they do, they will still be vulnerable to U.S. weapons such as
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and the B-1, the FAS said.
   Using the B-2 to hit Soviet mobile weapons is risky because the
plane would needed targeting information from U.S. satellites, the
FAS said. Those satellites could be knocked out by Soviet weapons
during the early stages of any war, it said, leaving the B-2 without
an effective way to locate its targets.
   ``In fact, the Stealth bomber is as much a first-strike weapon as
the MX. Both systems are intended to destroy Soviet missiles before
they can be launched against the United States,'' said the FAS,
which has also been critical of the MX.
   It concluded that ``the B-2 poses the same dangers as the MX and
the Strategic Defense Initiative _ increased risk of nuclear war,
further escalation of the arms race; and complication of arms
control and reduction.''
   The FAS study cited what it said are a number of technical
concerns about the B-2.
   ``Problems with the stability of flying wing designs date back to
the YB-49 flying wing in the 1940s,'' it noted, citing reports that
a companion F-19 Stealth fighter has suffered several crashes. The
Air Force has not confirmed those crashes.
   Even should all the problems be solved, ``there are a number of
questions regarding the extent to which the B-2 and its stealth
technology will be effective,'' it said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Unlike Bush, Reagan's Home-State Credentials
Unchallenged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A tale of two politicians:
   George Bush, born and raised in New England, moved to Texas as a
young man, made a career for himself in one of the state's leading
industries, raised a family, entered Texas politics and was twice
elected to office.
   He is dogged to this day by skepticism about his claim to be a
Texan.
   Ronald Reagan, born and raised in the Midwest, moved to
California as a young man, made a career for himself in one of the
state's leading industries, raised two families, entered California
politics and was twice elected to office.
   Nobody ever suggests that he is not a Californian.
   In fact, as Reagan flies off today for a round of pre-election
politicking, much of his activity will be focused on the state he
first visited as an Iowa sportscaster covering the Chicago Cubs in
spring training.
   ``That's his home state. It's felt he can be very helpful here,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in Santa
Barbara as he outlined the Illinois-born president's itinerary right
after the Republican convention in August.
   But if Bush's career as an oilman and his two terms as a
congressman from a Houston district don't qualify the vice president
as a Texan, how come a movie career and two terms as governor of
California make Reagan an undisputed Californian?
   ``I wonder whether it doesn't have to do with the important
events in one's life whether one considers oneself a native of a
particular state,'' says Alan Heslop, a professor of ethics at
Claremont McKenna College and a specialist in California voting
opinions. ``One of the most important events to all of us, I think,
is where one's children go to school. Ronald Reagan's children went
to school in California.''
   Of Bush's five children, one attended the University of Texas,
but the others went to Harvard Business College and Yale, to Tulane,
to the University of Virginia and to Boston College.
   There are more reasons for the difference.
   For one thing, while Texans traditionally look askance at New
Englanders, California was practically settled by Midwesterners.
Pasadena was once called, in fact, ``The Indiana Colony of
California.''
   ``The settlers of Southern California came mainly from the
American heartland, from rural and small-town areas,'' historian
Garry Wills wrote, ``but they invented something different, a kind
of hick cosmopolis.''
   Reagan was right at home.
   Both his marriages were to women he met in California, but both
were from the Midwest as he was. Jane Wyman was born in St. Joseph,
Mo., and Nancy Davis grew up in Chicago.
   Even Louella Parsons, the gossip columnist who chronicled his
marriages, was from Reagan's home town of Dixon, Ill.
   Except for the White House, Reagan has never maintained a home
outside California since he signed a six-month contract with Warner
Brothers in 1937. He had a home in Pacific Palisades before being
elected president and plans to divide his time between a home in Los
Angeles and his ranch north of Santa Barbara starting Jan. 20.
   Bush's legal residence is Suite 271 of the Houstonian Hotel and
Conference Center, but he purchased a home in Kennebunkport, Maine,
after becoming vice president.
   Whatever his residence, Bush supporters in Texas resent
suggestions that he is not one of them.
   ``Texas is really his home and he loves the state,'' Will Farish,
whose Houston company handles the vice president's assets in a blind
trust, said in a recent interview.
   Bush, too, likes to remind Texas audiences that he's ``back
home.''
   Still, ponder this:
   When Reagan spoke at an Italian-American dinner of meat balls and
ziti in West Orange, N.J., this month, the band unhesitatingly
struck up ``California Here I Come.'' (The second line is ``Right
Back Where I Started From.'')
   If it had been George Bush, would they have played ``Deep in the
Heart of Texas?''

<HEAD>Shortage Seen Among Health Care Workers For the Elderly</HEAD>

   Continued low wages and difficult working
conditions will lead to a shortage of health aides needed to care
for America's elderly, according to a report prepared by advocacy
groups.
   ``This nation is on the brink of a full-blown crisis in
caregiving for the chronically ill,'' said Lou Glasse, president of
the Older Women's League, which joined with a government employees'
union in commissioning the study.
   ``An exploited, overburdened work force is caring for the frail,
the sick and the elderly,'' Glasse said.
   Glasse's organization issued the study jointly on Wednesday with
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
   Gerald W. McEntee, president of the 1.4 million-member union,
said chronic care workers ``are among the most exploited workers in
our nation.''
   ``The solutions to the crisis are obvious _ a higher minimum
wage, improvements in Medicaid reimbursement, more stringent
licensing and training requirements,'' he said.
   The groups' report compiled information from state and federal
statistics from 1985 to the present.
   It painted a bleak picture of the 1.5 million health care aides
caring for patients in America's more than 25,000 nursing and
private homes. It said the majority of the workers are middle-aged
minority women earning just above minimum wage without insurance
coverage or overtime.
   Most leave their health care jobs within five years for those
reasons.
   Given the conditions, Glasse said, it will be difficult to find
the 500,000 health care aides the Labor Department estimates will be
needed by the year 2000.
   The report quoted the American Health Care Association as saying
more than half of nursing homes surveyed already report shortages of
nursing aides.
   The National Association of Home Care, representing organizations
providing home care, reported comparable shortages.
   Alice Quinlan, a consultant who compiled the study, noted that
the number of persons requiring paid caretakers is increasing
rapidly. She said many family members who otherwise would provide
such care now must seek employment to make ends meet.

   Bob Hope says he has been going to bat for
county Supervisor Mike Antonovich because the politician's a
``softball pitcher.''
   ``Softball and politics go hand in hand _ they're both
underhanded,'' Hope joked at a $500-a-plate fund-raiser Tuesday
night.
   But some opponents of Antonovich say the comedian is playing hard
ball, trying to score a starring role in what they have labeled his
latest road picture: ``The Road to Jordan Ranch.''
   Protesters outside the dinner said Hope is trying to win county
approval for a road that would lead through the Santa Monica
Mountains National Recreation area to the entertainer's 1,500-home
Jordan Ranch development in Ventura County.
   Hope denied he is trying to curry favor from Antonovich, but the
supervisor's opponent, Baxter Ward, has turned the matter into a
political issue.
   ``He is entertaining at Mr. Antonovich's fund-raiser ... I think
with a purpose in mind,'' Ward said at debate last month.
   Antonovich, at the debate, said ``adequate roads'' were needed in
the area and promised he would work with the community to reach an
environmentally sound decision if Ventura County approves the
housing project.

<HEAD>Democratic Senate Candidates Outdistancing GOP Rivals in Fund
Raising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Something strange is going on in this year's 33
election contests for the U.S. Senate: Democrats are raising more
campaign money than their Republican rivals.
   By the end of last month, according to financial data reported to
the Federal Election Commission, the 33 Democrats running for Senate
seats had collected $83.6 million toward their campaigns. Their 33
GOP opponents had pulled in $73.3 million.
   ``It is unusual,'' said Tom Mason, communications director for
the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party's campaign
arm. ``But it's incumbency talking,'' as well as givers'
expectations that the Senate will remain under Democratic control,
he said.
   It is true that incumbents always have an easier time raising
campaign money, and that Democrats have more incumbents, 15, up for
re-election this year than the Republicans, 12.
   And it also is true that most political analysts are predicting
not only that Democrats will hold onto their 54-46 Senate majority,
but they may pad it by a seat or two come Nov. 8.
   GOP incumbents actually fared slightly better than their
Democratic counterparts in fund raising. The dozen Republicans
averaged $3.8 million apiece as of Sept. 30, while the 15 Democratic
senators averaged $3.4 million.
   But in nearly every other category _ open-seat races,
challengers, and political action committee money _ the Democrats
outdistanced their traditionally well-heeled rivals.
   Mason chalks some of the differences up to unusual situations in
a handful of states that skew the numbers the Democrats' way, and
topping his ``unusual list'' is Herb Kohl.
   ``It's like running against a bank,'' he says of the Milwaukee
Democrat who holds a substantial lead in the Wisconsin Senate race
against GOP state Senate minority leader Susan Engeleiter. Kohl,
owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team and heir to a family
grocery store chain, spent $3 million, most of it his own money, to
overcome better-known rivals in the primary, and may top $6 million
by Election Day.
   Engeleiter, who is conceded to be better versed on the issues,
was trailing 3-to-1 in fund raising and was down by more than 20
points in the last published statewide poll. Kohl has sought to make
his spending a virtue, saying it means he won't be beholden to
special interests. ``Nobody's senator but yours,'' is the tagline to
his prolific TV spots.
   Mason also points to Virginia, an open seat where former
Democratic Gov. Charles Robb has been regarded as the prohibitive
favorite for years and has been treated by campaign donors more as
an incumbent than as an open-seat candidate. Robb had raised $2.7
million, compared with $192,000 for his lesser-known GOP opponent
Maurice Dawkins.
   In addition, Republicans say the presidential election has
diverted attention from bids by quality GOP candidates and made it
harder for them to compete for a limited amount of campaign dollars.
   But Democrats have other explanations for their new-found parity
with the GOP in fund raising.
   ``The candidates we recruited are an impressive group of elected
officials who have their own political bases and their own
fund-raising bases,'' said Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``Democratic challengers
are not being outspent 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 like in previous years.''
   Democrats, after a slow start, have learned to be competitive for
special-interest money, as well, she said. FEC figures show
Democratic Senate candidates overall have received $21.4 million
from political action committees, while Republicans have collected
just $17.5 million.
   The disparity led to a ``woodshed'' session last month at which
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and chief fund-raiser Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn., called leaders from business PACs to a meeting
to scold them for supporting Democrats.
   ``We're getting far fewer contributions than the Democrats are,''
said Mason. ``The message (at the meeting) was that business PACs
should take a serious look at pro-business candidates. That they
should look at the philosophies of the people they're giving to.''
   Some Capitol Hill observers are predicting that the Democrats'
catch-up in raising PAC money will lead Republicans, who have
protected the current fund-raising system so far, to throw out the
rules in 1989.
   ``This, I think, will be the last election we have under the
current system,'' said Charles Cook, a political analyst and author
of a political newsletter. ``I am convinced we're seeing big-time
reform next year. Republicans just are not going to defend PACs any
more. They will decide it's in their self interest.''
   Republicans are not shut out of the picture entirely when it
comes to money, however. Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., tops the money
list for all candidates so far this year, having amassed about $12
million for his re-election bid, roughly double the amount his
challenger, Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, has raised.
   And in a hard-fought open seat contest in Mississippi, Republican
Rep. Trent Lott has outdistanced opponent Rep. Wayne Dowdy in fund
raising and holds a nearly 4-to-1 advantage in cash on hand going
into the crucial final weeks of the campaign.

   Is there a market niche among swing voters for
a Massachusetts governor who's mounting an unprecedented television
sales campaign for himself? Probably not, analysts say, but he's got
the right idea.
   Saturation exposure is ``a perfectly reasonable strategy'' for
Democrat Michael Dukakis, given his double-digit deficit in the
polls and the proximity of Election Day, says Larry Sabato, a
political scientist at the University of Virginia.
   ``But you've got to have a product to sell. You have to have
something people want to buy,'' says Sabato. ``What they may not be
accounting for is the fact that most people have apparently
concluded that they don't want Michael Dukakis to be president.
Seeing him more often is not going to change that evaluation.''
   Dukakis is waging an airwaves war to ward off the closing of
American minds, abetted by TV news and interview shows that are
providing him with unprecedented blocks of free exposure to millions
of viewers.
   The invitations are flowing to both Dukakis and Republican
nominee George Bush. But while Bush, the nearly prohibitive
favorite, is still weighing whether and where to appear, Dukakis is
taking on all comers.
   ``He's going on every TV show he can find except Morton Downey
Jr.,'' joked Michael Robinson, a Georgetown University government
professor, pollster and author of two books about campaign media
coverage.
   ``Don't get me wrong, he's doing the right thing,'' Robinson
added. ``But will this turn the election around? Of course not.''
   Dukakis latest extended appearance, 90 minutes on ABC's
``Nightline'' Tuesday night, drew predictable raves from his own
spin doctors and equally predictable put-downs from the Bush camp.
   ``A terrific session,'' pronounced Dukakis adviser Steve
Engelberg.
   ``He got his pants chewed up,'' declared Bush spokesman Mark
Goodin.
   More objective reviewers noted that Dukakis passed up numerous
chances during the interview to stress his new populist image as a
fighter for ``Main Street'' Americans, a president who would be ``on
your side.'' He also failed to reject a Koppel suggestion that Bush
has nailed ``yoabato said.
``That was the dullest interview I've ever seen Ted Koppel conduct.
Dukakis' answers just weren't that lively or interesting. And he
missed so many opportunities to make useful points from his
perspective. Something to warm him up, something to make him appear
more human.''
   Dukakis is running the usual 30-second TV ads and a 5-minute
network spot summarizing his appeal. He has already appeared, in
addition to ``Nightline,'' on the morning news shows and the Larry
King talk show on Cable News Network.
   His wife, Kitty, was on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' His running
mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, was on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' and was interviewed on the CBS ``Evening News'' Wednesday
night.
   A new CBS News-New York Times poll indicates about a quarter of
the nation's probable voters still classify themselves as undecided.
Dukakis will have a few more shots at them, including lengthy
appearances on the CBS and NBC evening newscasts and an interview
with David Frost on the Fox network Nov. 6.
   ``Everything depends on his performance and how interested swing
voters or soft Bush supporters are in hearing him make his pitch,''
said John Buckley, a Republican consultant and CBS commentator.
   ``He has everything to gain because he has nothing to lose,''
Buckley added. ``He's behind in every poll. He's behind in more than
40 states. His only hope is to get as much exposure for himself as
possible and hope that what he says has some resonance with voters.''
   Robinson, a self-professed Democrat, said he can't imagine
Dukakis attracting anyone into his column ``by force of personality.
But he can't hide now, he's got to come out. He's got to be Michael
Dukakis. And he will go down in an honorable defeat.''

   An anti-nuclear physicians' group on Wednesday
urged President Reagan to take drastic steps to improve safety at
U.S. nuclear weapons-making facilities, where production virtually
has halted because of safety concerns.
   Four major plants in the 14-facility manufacturing complex have
been wholly or partially closed for safety reasons and the
production of nuclear weapons has ground to a halt, according to
officials at the Energy and Defense departments.
   The anti-nuclear group, Physicians for Social Responsibility,
said in a statement that contamination and dubious safety procedures
at the plants ``have direct and potentially devastating medical
implications.''
   ``They constitute a public health emergency,'' said H. Jack
Geiger, a member of the committee and a professor at the City
University of New York Medical School.
   Geiger said not enough studies have been conducted to determine
whether nuclear wastes from the sites have caused cancer or other
illnesses among workers or nearby residents. The Energy Department
has estimated it would cost $66 billion to $110 billion in the
long-term to clean up the waste and upgrade the facilities, and
congressional estimates have run as high as $170 billion.
   In a letter to Reagan, the physicians' group urged the
administration to give the newly created National Defense Safety
Board the power to close down any Energy Department nuclear facility
it deems ``not ... in compliance with safety, public health,
occupations and environmental standards.''
   Congress created the board under the defense authorization bill
for fiscal 1989 to monitor DOE's beleaguered nuclear weapons
program, which manufactures atomic weapons for the Pentagon. The
board does not have powers of enforcement.
   DOE is reviewing the safety and operation of all of its plants to
report to Congress by mid-December on whether to close any of them.
   The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said an early draft of that
report calls for permanent closing of two facilities, one in
Fernald, Ohio, and another near Denver, where work was interrupted
earlier this year because of health and safety reasons.
   At the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver, two workers and an Energy
Department inspector suffered low-level radioactive contamination on
Sept. 29, after which authorities closed Building 771, a plutonium
reprocessing facility there.
   The Energy Department cited the exposure of the workers when it
announced the closing earlier this month. However, the department
was aware of severe problems at the plant even before the accident,
a department official said late Wednesday.
   ``It's my understanding that (the contamination of the workers
and the inspector) was essentially a catalytic incident'' that
prompted the closing of the facility, said C. Anson Franklin, the
chief Energy Department spokesman said in an interview.
   Franklin said Energy Department inspectors had been in the plant
several times before the accident ``and had come up with quite a
long list of changes. We believe the contractor (Rockwell) was
sincere and committed to making these changes, but we felt the
progress (assessed after the accident) hadn't been as rapid as we
would like to see. So that feeling led to the conversations that
resulted in the shutdown of the facility.''
   Rockwell spokesman Ed Heintz on Wednesday emphasized that
although Building 771, the plutonium reprocessing building, is
closed down, that does not necessarily mean the plant's operations
are halted. However, he said he couldn't provide more specifics
because the quantity of plutonium stockpiled was classified.
   The New York Times in Thursday's editions quoted a General
Accounting Office report as saying that an inspector, identified in
the GAO report as J. Krupar, found a series of ``very serious''
violations at Rocky Flats that left ``no margins for safety.''
   His concerns included ``slow and unskilled'' work by employees
assigned to monitor radiation levels; radiological monitors that
were ``unchecked, out of service and out of calibration;''
``haphazard, inconsistent'' posting of warning signs outside rooms
with radioactive contamination, ``electrical safety is dangerously
managed,'' and ``attitudes are complacent.''
   The GAO report was prepared for Rep. David E. Skaggs, D-Colo.,
and a copy was obtained by The Times.
   Franklin told The Associated Press: ``I haven't seen the GAO
report, but it's my understanding that it essentially recaps the
findings of the Department of Energy's inspectors at Rocky Flats.''
   Workers at the Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, about
20 miles north of Cincinnati, have been striking the plant for a
month, forcing it to suspend operations. And Ohio Gov. Richard
Celeste has urged that federal authorities close the Fernald plant,
which according to DOE documents filed in court, regularly has
dumped radioactive waste into the water and air.
   A DOE spokesman, Will Callicott, said that because the
department's study on whether to close any nuclear facilities was
not complete, ``it is premature to comment on its recommendations.''
   Two other major weapons facilities have been closed. The three
reactors at the Savannah River Plant at Aiken, S.C., where the
department manufactures plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons,
were shut down earlier this year for safety reasons.
   The department is working on plans to restart one of the reactors
in December, although details have not been finalized, Callicott
said.
   The department closed down the other reactor at which it had been
manufacturing plutonium and tritium, in Hanford, Wash., and has no
current plans to reopen it, officials said.
   The physicians' committee urged Reagan to ``prohibit the
Department of Energy from restarting any of its reactors at Savannah
River, or reopening facilities presently closed at Fernald, Rocky
Flats and Hanford until (an independent commission) completes an
evaluation of the public health, occupational and environmental
safety risks of the continued operation of these facilities.''
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said the president's office
had not received the letter from the physicians' committee and could
not comment directly on it.
   ``The Department of Energy is on top of this situation,'' said
Cooper. Energy Secretary John ``Herrington has developed a plan to
check out all the sites, to issue a report in December on all of the
sites, and rank the sites in order of safety.''
   ``The bottom line is that the president has said that we will not
operate an unsafe nuclear plant, and we will not,'' said Cooper.
   U.S. officials have said they have adequate supplies of
plutonium, but face critical shortages of tritium, a radioactive
isotope of hydrogen used to boost the power of nuclear explosions.

   When George Bush gets wound up, odd words
sometimes happen.
   This can sentence a campaign crowd to some bizarre sentences, but
the partisans don't seem to care. So they cheered the vice president
in Akron, Ohio, the other day when he explained:
   ``In terms of the environment, I will be a good president for the
environment because I know in what kind of decade to leave the kids,
not what we're in right today.
   ``I will do better,'' he said.
   And in Williston, Vt., on taxes:
   ``You know the governor of Massachusetts _ I don't know why they
call it Taxachusetts _ I didn't name it Taxachusetts. The people in
Taxachusetts named it Taxachusetts.''
   Bush campaign days generally begin with a smooth, polished
performance dealing with a single theme _ economics this week. The
Republican presidential nominee speaks from a text, sticking to the
script by using a TelePrompTer. He's an orderly orator most
mornings, scripted and steady.
   But the relatively mild-mannered campaigner vanishes later in the
day, when it comes time to deliver the standard, everyday campaign
speech to the rally at the firehouse, or the airport, or the
Republican barbeque.
   For example, here's Bush taunting Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis for his late-campaign counteroffensive accusing the
Republicans of lying about his record:
   ``These guys can dish it out but they can't take it. I'll tell
you something _ I love it ...''
   Perhaps he did, but within a day his campaign strategists had put
together a dossier and staged a Washington news conference to defend
their advertisements and insist that Dukakis was the liar.
   And on Wednesday they began broadcasting a counter-counter ad
that begins: ``Michael Dukakis deliberately misled 62 million
Americans in the last debate.''
   Bush's sometimes fractured campaign rhetoric usually shows up in
his set, standard speech, the one delivered to the daily rallies,
routine in any presidential campaign.
   Those speeches are essentially a shorthand review of what's gone
before, a compilation of the lines that worked best along the way.
They are like pieces of a puzzle assembled into one speech, 15
minutes or so of the candidate's best applause lines. And they
become as predictable as a tape recording in most campaigns.
   Bush has put the excitement back. It's as though a few of the
pieces of his set speech came from another puzzle.
   ``Hey, listen, I forgot, I can't let one event go by ...'' he
told a GOP rally in Lima, Ohio, Tuesday, and hit Dukakis for
criticizing the U.S. invasion of Grenada five years ago.
   He almost forgot the Pledge of Allegiance, too, but not quite.
   ``I think it is good to have children sign the pledge _ say the
pledge.''
   In Sioux Falls, S.D., on Wednesday, Bush thanked a crowd for
South Dakota's hospitality, saying, ``You've been very pleasant to
the Bush family, we've been here, thousands of us, five kids, one
wife, me, back again.''
   Bush has taken to counting the days until the Nov. 8 election,
although not always well. With 13 days to go, he urged Republicans
in Billings, Mont., to turn out their vote, ``Literally, 11 days and
an hour, we're going to know the answer to this.''
   That certainly would make him the first to know.

   An independent group supporting George Bush
plans to flood cable stations in Ohio and Florida with ads
denouncing the military stands of Democrat Michael Dukakis, whose
campaign is denouncing another new Bush ad as ``a cynical lie.''
   The National Security Political Action Committee said Wednesday
its ad will run 2,400 times Nov. 1-7 on cable stations in Florida
and Ohio. The production and time buys cost $100,000.
   The spot lists five weapons systems it said Dukakis opposes and
says ``a Dukakis group calls for a $75 billion cut in defense,'' a
reference to the Boston-based Jobs with Peace Campaign on whose
board Dukakis serves.
   ``As former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I know that such cuts
will cripple our country,'' retired Adm. Thomas H. Moorer says in
the ad. ``We cannot afford to have Dukakis sitting across from
Gorbachev. We must support George Bush for president. It's a matter
of national security.''
   The pro-Bush group has spent $2.5 million on ads supporting the
Republican, including earlier ones running under the name Americans
for Bush. Bush campaign officials have filed complaints against the
group and disavowed its activities.
   A new ad accusing Dukakis of raiding his state's pension fund,
which began airing Tuesday night in spot markets around the country,
drew protests from both the Dukakis campaign and The Wall Street
Journal.
   The ad says Dukakis ``deliberately misled'' 62 million Americans
in the last debate by denying the raiding charge and calls him
``unbelievable.''
   The spot features a debate clip and a quote from the Journal that
``it is indisputable that $27 million moved out of the nation's most
underfunded state pension system, so that the governor could claim
to have balanced the fiscal 1988 budget.''
   Albert Hunt, Washington bureau chief for the Journal, said the
newspaper is protesting the ad to the Bush campaign becauses it
creates the impression that the quotes came from the front page when
in fact they came from the opinion pages.
   The Dukakis campaign said the incident in question was ``a
budgetary transfer'' of an unanticipated surplus and had no effect
on the level of pension benefits or the security of the system.
   Also on the ad front, the National Rifle Association said it is
suing the Dukakis campaign to stop threats of legal action against
radio stations airing ads attacking the Democrat's stands on gun
control and crime. The ads are running in more than 20 states.
   The NRA is seeking a judicial declaration that the Dukakis
campaign's threats of legal action are baseless and the First
Amendment would protect radio stations against any liability if
legal action were taken. The lawsuit also seeks an injunction to
stop further threats of libel suits against the radio stations.
   Dukakis' general counsel, Daniel Taylor, has told the NRA it is
distorting Dukakis' positions and wrongly attributing statements to
him. Dukakis campaign officials in several states have told radio
stations to stop running the ads.

   Republican presidential nominee George Bush said
Wednesday that Democratic rival Michael Dukakis sounds like a man
``just itching to repeal'' the income tax cuts of the past eight
years. Bush said his election would be a mandate against tax
increases.
   In an economics lecture stressing his week-long campaign theme,
the vice president said the Massachusetts governor ``never met a
payroll'' and doesn't understand the impact of taxes on business.
   Bush campaigned in Michigan, with 20 electoral votes at stake on
Nov. 8, before heading for rallies in Sioux Falls, S.D., and
Billings, Mont., small states where his aides said the race could be
close. ``We're going to shore up our support,'' said press secretary
Sheila Tate.
   Bush told more than 1,600 people at the Economic Club of Detroit
that Reagan administration policies have produced astounding
economic growth despite Democratic ``voices of doom.''
   The GOP nominee said he would seek to spur that growth by cutting
the capital gains tax rate, a proposal Dukakis has denounced
repeatedly as a tax break for the wealthy.
   Capital gains, realized on the sale of such assets as stocks and
real estate, are taxed like any other income under tax legislation
that took effect last year. Bush wants to restore preferential
treatment for capital gains, cutting the top rate from 33 percent to
15 percent.
   He said such a move has been ``endorsed by everyone,'' from John
F. Kennedy to President Reagan, from Democratic vice presidential
nominee Lloyd Bentsen to Bush running mate Dan Quayle.
   ``It's not a tax break for the rich, it is a break for those who
want to have a job in this country,'' Bush said. ``Unfortunately, my
opponent's only experience with business is regulating it and taxing
it.
   ``He's never run a business. ... He's never met a payroll. He
doesn't understand how when you're starting out, you need people to
join you in taking a risk. So he paints my proposal as an effort to
help the rich.''
   ``Wrong,'' said Bush. He said most capital gains are realized by
people who earn less than $50,000 a year.
   The Dukakis campaign on the other hand cites a Congressional
Budget Office study concluding more than half the capital gains are
realized by the 1 percent of richest Americans.
   As for income taxes, Bush said rates have been cut by an average
27 percent since Reagan took office in 1981, and the results in new
jobs and economic growth ``have been staggering.''
   ``Despite the certifiable success of our tax cuts in unleashing
the longest recovery in our history, my opponent thinks they were a
disaster,'' Bush said, recalling Dukakis' criticism of the cuts
during the Democratic primary campaign.
   ``Those sound to me like the words of someone who is just itching
to repeal one of the most successful economic policies in our
history,'' Bush said.
   He said the reason is that Dukakis is proposing ``mandated new
spending'' that would cost the government and business billions upon
billions of dollars.
   ``If I am elected in 13 days eight hours and 22 minutes from now
... I will work with Congress, telling them the American people, in
electing me, voted against a tax increase,'' Bush said.
   He said the voters also would be say they wanted the president to
have line-item veto authority, so he could delete specific spending
items from an appropriations bill without vetoing the entire measure.
   Answering written questions, Bush said the U.S. trade deficit
should shrink under current policies.
   ``I'm convinced that this is on the right track without further
legislation,'' he said. ``I have in the past supported the voluntary
restraint agreements as they affect autos and I am open-minded on
that question. But I am not one who favors protection.''
   Bush refused to say who he would nominate as secretary of state
on the ground that such a disclosure might break rules against
promising appointments. The Cabinet post is widely believed to be
earmarked for James A. Baker III, his campaign chairman, former
treasury secretary and a long-time Bush associate from Texas.
   Bush said that to answer questions about appointments to a Bush
administration ``conveys a sense of overconfidence that I do not
feel.''
   Bush wrapped up his campaigning with a rally in Billings, Mont.,
repeating that that Dukakis could raise income taxes.
   ``Don't elect him because he just might take that tax cut away
from the American people,'' Bush said again.
   At Rocky Mountain College on a gymnasium stage with Montana
Republicans and a dozen impassive Indians in full headress, Bush
also renewed his pledge to fight against gun control.
   ``I'm a sportsman, I'm a hunter, like to do it,'' he said. ``And
I don't believe we need the federal govenment going forward with gun
control legislation.''
   Urging Montana Republicans to turn out the vote on Nov. 8, Bush
had a little trouble with his arithmetic.
   ``Literally, 11 days and an hour, we're going to know the answer
to this,'' he said of an election 13 days away.
   In Billings, Air Force Two taxied to the runway for a flight to
Tacoma, Wash., but then turned back when the galley crew reported
gas fumes in the rear of the plane. Fire fighting crews were sent in
and the engines were turned off while an inspection was made.
   Bush and other members of his entourage remained on board.
   After about 20 minutes, it was determined that strong cross winds
had blown fuel fumes into the aircraft and they would dissipate on
takeoff, as they did when the plane departed.
   Some time after Bush left, the press plane chartered by media
covering the vice president was held on the ground because of high
winds that prevented takeoff, Bush officials said.
   At a Republican rally in the stockyards in Sioux Falls, Bush
challenged what he said were Democratic proposals to impose supply
controls on American farmers. He said Dukakis stands for such
tightened controls and ``I don't believe he should be against the
American farmer.''
   ``We are not going to pull the rug out from under the American
farmer and go to some kind of supply management,'' Bush told several
hundred people at the stockyards rally.

<HEAD>Ex-Bomber, Vegetable Vendor Among Offbeat Candidates for Israeli
Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Israel's wide-open electoral system, a man
who once threw a bomb into parliament and an 89-year-old former
vegetable vendor who wants to throw a monkey wrench into
parliamentary rules are running for office.
   Their parties are among several special interest groups counting
on single-issue platforms to woo undecided voters in the Nov. 1
parliamentary elections.
   Others entered in the race include parties that want to ban
income taxes, improve prisoners' rights, get rid of one-third of
Israel's legislators and boost pensions for retirees.
   The small parties are encouraged by Israel's system of
proportional representation, which awards a seat in the Knesset, or
parliament, to any group that wins 1 percent of the vote, about
24,000 ballots.
   Pollsters say it is unlikely parties with limited appeal will
succeed. ``I don't expect any of them to be in the Knesset after the
elections,'' said political analyst Daniel Elazar of the Jerusalem
Center for Public Affairs.
   But Elazar conceded: ``They're very entertaining ... a little
like the dog-and-pony act in a vaudeville show.''
   The election is being contested by 27 parties, including 14 that
now hold parliamentary seats. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres's Labor
Party are expected to split about 60 percent of the vote.
   One of the more obscure hopefuls is the Topaz Party of diamond
polisher Moshe Duak, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1957
after a hand grenade he tossed into the Knesset wounded then Israeli
leaders Golda Meir and David Ben-Gurion.
   Duak, who says his party represents Jews of Middle East origin,
told election officials he walked across country to collect the
1,500 signatures needed to get on the ballot.
   When he registered for the elections, Duak pulled a list of 2,000
signatures from a weather-beaten backpack and said: ``I don't have a
phone, but you can reach me at the place where I'm studying.''
   Another small party hoping for a break is the ``Silent Force
Movement,'' which placed 89-year-old David Sanhi at top of its
ticket to highlight its protest against irrational laws and rules.
   Party founder Yaakov Gross said one such rule could make Sanhi, a
retired vegetable stand owner who has never held office, speaker of
parliament because the post goes to the oldest member until a
permanent speaker is elected.
   Gross also wants to end income tax because he said it encourages
cheating and ``immoral behavior.''
   He said he named his party the ``Silent Force'' because people
kept telling him, ``We've never heard of you.''
   The party got some attention by choosing to identify itself with
a Hebrew letter that is sometimes used as a phallic symbol.
   ``It was appropriate for a protest party,'' Gross said. ``We
figured we could use it in our campaign ads, as long as we used it
in a very delicate way.''
   Two other offbeat candidates, Victor Tayar and Benzion Koren,
have each failed in running for Parliament seats twice before.
   Tayar, a restaurateur, says he is a champion of the poor, ``just
like Jesse Jackson.'' Koren, whose goal is better housing for army
veterans, is enough of a believer to have sold his Jerusalem
newstand to pay the $7,700 registration fee.
   Some pollsters say a few small groups may pick up one or two
seats if they represent large special interest groups and enough
voters become disenchanted with Labor and Likud.
   Aba Gefen, a retired civil servant who heads the Pensioners
Party, hopes to win enough seats on the strength of Israel's 400,000
retirees to play a role in forming a coalition government.
   ``If we hold the balance of power after the elections, we'll have
an influence,'' said Gefen, who wants to increase pension benefits.
   However, if the Pensioners Party fails to get a seat its ballots
will be ignored, and Labor Party officials say such wasted votes
could cost them much needed support. Likud also worries about little
parties that will cut into its backing from Jews of Middle East
origin.
   Elazar noted small parties have goals other than winning votes.
``Most of them just want to get on TV so they can talk about an idea
they think is important,'' he said.
   ``That's the way Israeli democracy is structured,'' he added.
``In this country, there's the possibility of giving a voice to
almost anything.''

   Four people, including former Green Bay Packers
halfback Travis Williams, were arrested Wednesday in a protest at
the Capitol against the plight of the homeless, police said.
   The four were charged with unlawful entry after staging a sit-in
at the reception area of California Sen. Alan Cranston's office,
said U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Dan Nichols.
   The maximum penalty for the charge is a $500 fine and six months
in prison. The four were being held pending arraignment in Superior
Court on Thursday.
   Williams, 42, of Richmond, Calif., said he has been homeless for
much of the last three years. Now, he said he is a security officer
in a soup kitchen and lives in a room that costs $200 a month.
   Since the daily protests began last month, 175 demonstrators have
been arrested. The protests, organized by the Community for Creative
Nonviolence, seek to point out to Congress the lack of affordable
housing in the United States.
   Arrested along with Williams were Susan Prather, 37, Crockett,
Calif.; Joanne Yerkes, 24, Berkeley, Calif., and Chester Celestine,
29, Richmond, Calif.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Ministers Meet On Upgrading Short-range Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO must maintain short-range
nuclear weapons now that the United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed to ban intermediate-range missiles, a new report says.
   The study will be the focus of a meeting beginning today of
defense ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
officials said. Most NATO nations want to increase the range of the
tactical weapons to make up for the loss of intermediate-range arms.
   The defense chiefs will be asked to endorse the report, a
detailed look at the role of short-range nuclear rockets and
artillery in the Western alliance.
   ``The conclusion is yes, there will be a requirement for
short-range nuclear forces but there's no reason ... for a decision
on how to pursue that goal ... now,'' a U.S. official said on
condition of anonymity.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the treaty in December to eliminate all U.S. and Soviet land-based
missiles with ranges from about 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   Since the agreement, the question of upgrading short-range
nuclear forces _ artillery and missiles with ranges up to about 300
miles _ has received more attention.
   ``The overall aim is the maintenance and enhancement of an
effective deterrence,'' said Frits Bolkestein, the Dutch defense
minister.
   He said the range of short-range, or tactical weapons, should be
extended and ``made more flexible and less vulnerable.''
   ``If systems can be made more effective and more survivable, the
number of warheads may consequently be reduced,'' he said.
   The ministers were expected to make no decisions on the
controversial issue of modernizing short-range weapons.
   Even so, the discussions probably will shape the debate leading
to a decision on whether to give NATO more powerful nuclear weapons
for the front lines. Analysts say ranges eventually may be extended
up to the treaty limits of about 300 miles.
   The United States and Britain have indicated support for
modernizing short-range weapons. But West Germany and the
Netherlands, with strong anti-nuclear groups, say NATO has no
pressing need now for such a decision.
   The most controversial of the weapons under discussion for
modernization is the Lance surface-to-surface missile, which was
introduced in 1972 and which military analysts say will be obsolete
by 1995.
   The Lance has a range of a little more than 60 miles, and a new
system might boost that up to more 250 miles.
   Also under discussion is a new tactical air-to-surface missile,
called a stand-off weapon, which would replace nuclear gravity
bombs. It would allow fighters to launch weapons to a target without
flying over heavy fighting.
   The short-range arsenal also includes nuclear artillery shells
for 155 mm and 203 mm howitzers, which have ranges up to 18 miles.
Work on upgrading these arms is under way.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci will attend the talks, held
twice a year on nuclear issues.
   Fourteen of NATO's 16 members will take part, with Iceland
attending as an observer. France is not part of NATO's joint
military structure.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Cafe Crown' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cafe Royal was a legendary Lower East Side
restaurant where the stars and patrons of the nearby Yiddish
theaters gathered to snack and schmooze before and after
performances.
   The famous Second Avenue watering hole is gone now, but its
spirit permeates Hy Kraft's ``Cafe Crown,'' a modest, mild comedy
set in a fictional recreation of the old cafe. The play, directed by
Elia Kazan, first had a three-month Broadway run during the 1941-42
season.
   Nearly a half century later, ``Cafe Crown'' has returned in a
lavish, loving production at the New York Shakespeare Festival's
Public Theater. The director this time around is Martin Charnin, the
man behind the musical, `Annie.'' Charnin has done all he can to
resuscitate the old play, and for much of its three acts, he
succeeds.
   First of all, Charnin and designer Santo Loquasto have created an
evocative setting, a beautiful Old World restaurant done in dark
wood and emerald green walls. An elaborate bar hugs one side of the
stage with a cluster of tables scattered down front. There's even a
spiffy revolving front door that hurdles customers in and out of the
cafe.
   Second, he has a bravura leading man. Eli Wallach stars as
impresario and actor David Cole, a role modeled after the famous
Yiddish performer Jacob Adler.
   ``I don't believe in restraint,'' bellows Cole, and neither does
Wallach. The character may be Jewish, but Wallach is all glorious
ham.
   The thin plot turns on Cole's decision to return to the theater
as the director of a new family drama he has written. ``It's a
simple tragedy,'' he explains. ``The story of parents and
children.'' If the story sounds a little bit like ``King Lear,''
what's the difference? The audience will adore it, Cole proclaims.
   Thirdly, ``Cafe Crown'' contains an astonishing array of veteran
character actors _ those hard-working, seldom celebrated performers
who shine, even in supporting roles. Eighteen actors play 21 roles
in the play, and there's not a dud among them.
   Wallach dominates the evening but he gets strong support from
this cavalcade of performers. Anne Jackson, Wallach's real-life
wife, plays his estranged spouse in ``Cafe Crown.'' In a beautifully
underplayed performance, Miss Jackson lets Wallach get the laughs.
She gets the sympathy.
   Bob Dishy is the essence of exasperation as a harried cafe
employee, but the master of the putdown is Fyvush Finkel as an
unflappable waiter who turns badgering the customers into a
laugh-getting art form.
   There is more hilarious funny business from Harry Goz as a
prolific Yiddish playwright, now working on play number 153, Joseph
Leon as a newspaper drama critic who writes his reviews before he
sees the plays and Marilyn Cooper as his whining wife who also
fancies herself an actress.
   Although this affectionate revival confirms that ``Cafe Crown''
is not a lost masterpiece, it does demonstrates that with a
marvelous cast, astute direction and a wonderful setting, an
enjoyable evening can be spun from the lightest of material.

   The United States has decided to withdraw from
its ``front-line'' Persian Gulf position one of two huge rented
barges used to support Special Operations Forces in the waterway,
administration officials say.
   The barge, which had been stationed in the northern gulf near an
Iranian stronghold on Farsi Island, is gradually being withdrawn to
an anchorage off Bahrain, said the officials, who spoke Wednesday on
condition they not be named.
   The barge will remain ``operational'' for the time being, in part
to reassure Arab allies in the region the United States is not
withdrawing its forces precipitously, the sources said.
   But the withdrawal is just one more indication the Pentagon is
prepared to reduce its naval presence if the cease-fire between Iran
and Iraq holds.
   ``This isn't the start of the drawdown, because we haven't
removed any of our warships yet,'' said one official. ``But it's a
step in that direction.''
   The barges, rented and deployed in 1987 after the Reagan
administration agreed to protect Kuwaiti-owned tankers inside the
gulf, were cloaked in secrecy for months. It was only in late July
that Pentagon officials authorized reporters in the region to visit
one of them for the first time.
   The floating combat bases were put together when Arab states
surrounding the gulf rejected U.S. pleas to use their territory for
the special forces.
   Equipped with communications gear and a variety of weapons, the
barge bases were home for Navy SEAL commandos who manned patrol
boats and Army Special Operations Forces helicopters.
   The barges, code-named Hercules and Winbrown 7, have been cramped
homes for about 200 soldiers, sailors and Marines.
   Gen. George B. Crist, the head of the U.S. Central Command, said
in a recent interview that the barges were instrumental in
discouraging Iranian shipping raids in the northern gulf for seven
months before the cease-fire.
   Their secret, night-flying Army helicopters also caught an
Iranian minelayer, proving that Tehran was mining gulf sea lanes,
the general noted.
   Crist added that the barges, an idea borrowed from Vietnam where
American forces patrolled in enemy-held areas, showed it was
possible to range far afield ``without a tremendous base
infrastructure ... and still project our power.''

   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen has renewed his attacks against Republican counterpart Dan
Quayle, but he still stops barely short of declaring him unqualified.
   On the ``CBS Evening News'' on Wednesday night, anchorman Dan
Rather put it directly to Bentsen. ``Do you, or do you not, believe
that Sen. Dan Quayle is qualified to be president of the United
States,'' he asked.
   Bentsen, the courteous Texas senator that he is, refused to give
a yes or no answer.
   ``He is not nearly as qualified as a lot of other heavyweights in
the Republican party,'' he said. ``I think everyone in the Congress
was shocked and surprised when he was chosen.''
   Earlier Wednesday, Bentsen blasted Quayle at a rally in
Riverside, Calif.
   ``George Bush has a proven record of failure in the war against
drugs,'' Bentsen said. ``And now he wants to turn that job over to
Dan Quayle. Now you just tell me any qualifications he has in that
regard. If George Bush is serious about the war on drugs, then why
would he choose Dan Quayle to lead it?''
   He compared himself with his junior Senate colleague from Indiana.
   ``My friends, there's an important difference here,'' he told the
crowd at the plaza outside the Riverside, Calif., city hall. ``I
think millions of Americans would agree that Dan Quayle is not
qualified to step in if he had to and be president of the United
States of America.''
   Bentsen went on to ridicule the Republican campaign for saying
Quayle would head the U.S. space program.
   ``I see where Dan Quayle also wants to play a major role in
National Security,'' he said. ``Doesn't that shake you up a bit.
That's a frightening thought. Are you ready for that?''
   Bentsen talked of how Bush attended 17 national security meetings
and did not speak up against selling arms to Iran in exchange for
hostages. ``But you know, when I think about (that) and I think
about Dan Quayle, I believe I'd rather have George Bush there not
saying anything ... than having Dan Quayle active at the national
security meeting,'' he said.
   The Democratic campaign says Quayle remains a problem for Bush,
and one that would make a difference if the polls tighten up.
   ``We need to keep that issue in front of the voters,'' said Mike
McCurry, Bentsen's press secretary.
   Bentsen planned to continue stumping in California today for that
state's 47 electoral votes, more than any other.
   A Los Angeles Times poll released this week put the Democratic
ticket 11 points behind, but campaign officials said they believed
Dukakis' new advertising campaign was already cutting that margin.
   On Bentsen's schedule today was a foreign policy address to the
World Affairs Council in Los Angeles.

   The Agriculture Department doesn't usually
promote crop failures, but it's making one exception this year.
   When farmers go into their local USDA offices these days to apply
for drought relief or see about the 1989 wheat program, they'll
probably see posters warning about the hazards of growing marijuana.
   The USDA says its anti-drug message will be carried into every
corner of the nation by the department's sprawling agencies.
   ``One day or one week will not solve the problem of illegal drug
use,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Wednesday. ``But
participation in this day and in the week's activities can help
mobilize the efforts of concerned citizens _ in government and out _
to solve this distressing problem that faces America.''
   President Reagan recently proclaimed the week of Oct. 24-30 as
National Drug-Free America Week. In Washington, daily programs of
entertainment and brief speeches are making the rounds of various
government departments.
   ``We should note that this effort is bipartisan,'' Lyng said.
``Others, like us, are meeting today, or on another day this week,
all across the nation. They are assembling in town meetings, in
conferences, at rallies, in schools.''
   Lyng paid tribute to a number of USDA agencies for anti-drug
activities, including the Forest Service, which he said last year
``eradicated more than 250,000 high-potency marijuana plants grown
illegally on national forests, plants that had a street value of
nearly $1 billion.''
   The Forest Service arrested 135 suspects associated with the
illegal pot harvest and charged them with felonies, he said.
   Another agency, the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service is displaying anti-marijuana posters in its 3,000 county
offices, he said.
   The ASCS handles commodity programs, payments and emergency
drought relief for participating farmers. The agency also is using
newsletters in its program aimed at illegal marijuana cultivation.
   Lyng said the department's Food and Nutrition Service, which
administers school lunch and food stamp programs, is working with
the American School Food Service Association to support a ``Just Say
No'' message among school children.
   The agency also is working with the association to conduct a
poster and essay contest with a drug prevention theme among
elementary and secondary schools.
   Also, he said, the food agency ``encouraged the dairy industry to
display `Just Say No' on the side panels of milk cartons used in the
School Lunch Program, a potential for reaching 26 million children

   Agriculture Department scientists say they have
found a way to make oranges and grapefruits shed their peels quickly
and easily, with only a little tug here and there.
   The quick strip job is accomplished by giving the fruit a dose of
an enzyme, pectinase, which dissolves the albedo, or the white,
fleshy tissue that glues the peel to the fruit.
   Robert A. Baker, a chemist in the department's Agricultural
Research Service, said the process leaves the fruit's core ``much
cleaner than if you peeled it yourself.''
   Baker said the technique, called vacuum infusion, may reduce
current losses _ as high as 40 percent _ of fruit and juice from
hand peeling and sectioning. He works at the agency's Citrus and
Subtropical Products Laboratory, Winter Haven, Fla.
   ``Citrus processors can use this technology to make high-quality
orange and grapefruit sections that can be placed in jars, canned,
wrapped in plastic and sold as ready-to-eat peeled fruit, or used in
salad bars,'' Baker said in a report released here.
   Pectinase was described as ``an inexpensive food enzyme approved
by the Food and Drug Administration and used in the jelly and jam
industry.'' Baker said the enzyme solution is so weak that it has no
taste and doesn't affect the fruit's flavor.
   The technique was invented by Joseph Bruemmer, a chemist who
leads the research group that includes Baker at the Winter Haven
laboratory.

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Some part-time tobacco graders employed by the
Agriculture Department will get pay raises of up to 20 percent
beginning Nov. 6.
   Assistant Secretary Kenneth A. Gilles said Wednesday that the
tobacco graders in the GS-5 and GS-7 government pay scales will be
raised 20 percent, while those at then GS-9 level will receive a 13
percent increase.
   The workers, whose jobs are seasonal, now get about $290 a week
at the GS-5 level, $360 a week at GS-7, and $440 a week at GS-9.
   Gilles said USDA asked the Office of Personnel Management on Aug.
25 for a 20 percent increase across the board, but received approval
for only the three lower pay scales. Raises for graders at the
higher levels of GS-11 and GS-12 were denied. They currently receive
about $533 and $638 per week, respectively.
   ``This pay increase will make it easier for USDA to recruit and
maintain its quality tobacco grading work force,'' Gilles said.
   About 260 tobacco graders work for the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service. An agency spokesman, George Clarke, said their
salaries are paid from user fees and not taxpayer funds.
   Federal employees are scheduled for a 4.1 percent pay increase on
Jan. 1, 1989, and all tobacco graders _ including the ones receiving
Nov. 6 increases _ will share in that one, the agency said.

<HEAD>Cast, With Kathleen Battle, Shines In Met's `Barber'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for PMs.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For lovers of classical singing, the news at the
Metropolitan Opera's first ``The Barber of Seville'' this season is
that Kathleen Battle was in her usual radiant voice and the rest of
the cast was right up there with her.
   For musicologists, the news is that the remarkable third-act aria
which Rossini wrote for tenor Manuel Garcia, who sang Almaviva at
the 1816 premiere, was sung Wednesday night by American tenor
Rockwell Blake. Rossini took the aria out in 1817 when the tenor
engaged couldn't sing it. The Met had not included it for 25 years,
and possibly never had.
   Blake, who has the flexibility to sing pleasingly what really is
coloratura for a man, is used to singing the aria in Europe. In a
letter to critics last week, he expressed dismay that the Met had
cut 20 measures of it.
   Leo Nucci sang the barber, Figaro. He establishes his brash,
loud, wheeler-dealer character in his first entrance, coming on like
a snake-oil salesman. With that planted in listeners' minds, Nucci
tones down to become a fine singer and team player in an operatic
farce.
   Bass Enzo Dara was unusually funny as the guardian of Rosina
(Miss Battle) who intends to marry her. He will, of course, be
foiled by Almaviva, whose disguises as a soldier and a music
teacher, cooked up by Figaro, get him close to Rosina.
   Dara's comic timing and his singing are superb. To add humor, he
uses several different walks, including a fast, self-satisfied
shuffle, after he locks Rosina in the house.
   Miss Battle's voice is what a listener would dream it should be:
accurate, full of delicate warmth, floating with infinite grace.
   Robert Lloyd of Essex, England, made his Met debut as the
``real'' music teacher. He has a ripe bass and is commanding; it was
a delight to watch Dara respond to his stage business.
   Margaret Jane Wray has a small, often ignored scene as the
housekeeper which she sang so well as to be noticed.
   Ralf Weikert of Austria, who made his Met debut last season with
another bel canto opera, ``The Elixir of Love,'' conducted with
sensitivity.
   The Met last had presented ``The Barber'' in its 1984-85 season.

   ``In my enthusiasm to support the program, I decided to mandate

   Jeffrey said five or six employees were suspended Sunday and
Monday after refusing to wear the red ribbons that said, ``The
choice for me, drug free.'' On Monday, he made the ribbon-wearing
program voluntary after receiving complaints from the workers. They
had hired an attorney who claimed their First Amendment rights had
been violated.

   Actor Dennis Quaid may be portraying rock
'n' roller Jerry Lee Lewis in an upcoming movie, but he won't get
the singing parts, Lewis says.
   ``You're not getting the soundtrack, boy,'' Lewis told Quaid at a
gathering Wednesday to promote the movie, ``Great Balls Of Fire,''
much of which will be filmed in Memphis.
   Filming is to begin Monday on the movie, named for one of Lewis'
best known recordings. The film will be based on the beginning of
Lewis' career, which got a major boost at the old Sun Records studio
in Memphis.
   Lewis said he is impressed with Quaid's piano playing and
singing, but plans to record the music for the movie himself,
although Quaid indicated he might try some of the musical parts.
   Quaid said he studied piano for several months, watched films of
Lewis' performances and attended his concerts in researching the
part.

   Soul singer James Brown has been indicted in
connection with a police chase that started in Georgia and crossed
into South Carolina.
   Brown was charged Monday with two counts of assault and battery
with intent to kill and one count of failure to stop for a police
car. He earlier was charged in Georgia over the Sept. 24 incident.
   Police said Brown entered a seminar in Augusta carrying a gun,
and then led police on the chase.
   During the chase, Brown allegedly tried to run over two officers
who were setting up a roadblock. The officers shot out Brown's front
tires, and the singer continued driving ``on the rims'' for several
miles before driving his truck into a ditch, according to police
reports.
   Brown, 55, is on a European concert tour, but his attorney has
said he will be back for his trial here next week.

   Two former members of the singing DeBarge
family and two associates have been convicted of conspiring to
transport cocaine from Los Angeles and distribute it in Michigan.
   A U.S. District Court jury on Tuesday convicted Jonathon
``Chico'' DeBarge, Robert ``Bobby'' DeBarge, Dwayne O. Hill and Mark
Douglas. Each could receive a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
at their January sentencing.
   The four were accused of conspiring with at least two other
people to distribute 2.2 pounds of cocaine in western Michigan.
   Jonathon DeBarge, 22, of Grand Rapids, recorded a solo album,
``Chico DeBarge,'' that reached No. 33 on the Billboard magazine pop
music charts in 1986. Robert DeBarge, 26, of Los Angeles, was a
former member of the singing group Switch.
   The family's most famous brother, El DeBarge, pleaded no contest
in September 1986 to assault and battery charges in Grand Rapids.

<TEXT>
   An Iranian father and son convicted of a plot to
smuggle high-tech missile parts from the United States were part of
a world-wide effort by Iran to obtain U.S. weapons during the
Persian Gulf war, an official says.
   Ahmad Modarressi, 64, and his son, Majid, 30, each face up to 15
years in prison and $1.25 million in fines for their attempt to send
microwave tubes for the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system to Tehran.
   The father pleaded guilty last week, and the son was found guilty
Wednesday after a four-week jury trial in U.S. District Court.
   ``The Iranians have made a concerted effort all over the world to
buy American weapons and parts, and we have made a concerted effort
to stop them,'' said Edward Kittridge, a spokesman for the U.S.
Customs Service. ``This is a case in which we have prevailed.''
   The trial stemmed from a 10-month investigation in which a
Customs agent posed as an employee of the Massachusetts-based
Raytheon Co., maker of the Hawk missile.
   The undercover agent, Steven Crogan, recorded conversations with
the Modarressis in which they offered to pay him $280,000 if he
would steal the microwave tubes from Raytheon.
   They told Crogan they planned to disguise the tubes as
well-drilling equipment and ship them to Iran via a third country
such as Libya, Turkey or Switzerland.
   Expert witnesses testified that the tubes are a critical
component of the radar system that allows the Hawk to blast jet
aircraft out of the sky.
   They said Iran bought the missiles from the United States in the
1970s, while the Shah was still in power, but has run short of parts
since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and the beginning of the
Iran-Iraq war a year later. The two sides reached a cease-fire in
August.
   The Modarressis were arrested Jan. 15 in a Brighton freight yard
where they had come to inspect the tubes.
   The father and son went on trial together Sept. 28. But as
testimony neared a close last week, the elder Modarressi
unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty, leaving the jury to decide
only the case of the son.
   The younger Modarressi is a resident alien who has lived in the
United States 12 years and has an American wife and 4-year-old
daughter in Cincinnati.
   During the trial, his father was described as an international
merchant with homes in Istanbul and Tehran who previously had traded
in shoes and pecans.
   Judge Mark L. Wold scheduled sentencing for both men Nov. 7 and
released the son until then. The father is being held at the Salem
House of Correction.
   Defense attorney Robert Richman said he probably would appeal.

   A 26-year-old man stabbed his former wife to

said.
   Bundy's 8-year-old daughter from another marriage told

covered with blood. A fourth child who was in the apartment is an
infant.
   Augsburger's two children have been placed temporarily with the
county Department of Social Services, and the other two were staying

   A court ordered two Swiss television
journalists to pay fines of $65 each for killing a fish during a

   A Basel court ruled Wednesday that the journalists violated
animal protection laws when they put a fish in a container of water
they said was polluted in the same way the Rhine had been after the
accident, and filmed the fish in its death throes.
   The filming took place three months after the Nov. 1, 1986
accident at the chemical plant in Schweizerhalle, near Basel, a
statement from Swiss television said. The sequence was never
broadcast.
   The statement, issued after the ruling, said the sequence was
intended to give viewers a ``visual warning'' about the damage
caused by such accidents.
   The statement said the journalists might appeal the ruling.

New Port</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If the Iran-Iraq peace talks break down
over the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq will re-open a
deepwater port west of the waterway, its U.N. ambassador says.
   The ambassador, Ismat Kittani, predicted resolution of the issue
and also was optimistic about an exchange of tens of thousands of
prisoners of war held by each side, saying, ``That is the brightest
part of the picture.''
   The Iran-Iraq peace talks are to resume Monday in Geneva. The two
enemies agreed to a cease-fire in August, halting the war that began
in 1980.
   Kittani said one key to the talks is that his country is seeking
a pledge from Iran not to resume stopping ships in the Persian Gulf
to search for Iraq-bound war cargo.
   Iran has not searched any ships since the cease-fire began Aug.
20, but says it retains that right.
   Kittani made his comments Wednesday night at his home before
returning to Baghdad for consultations.
   The deepwater port at Khor Zouber, said Kittani, was productive
before the war began and could be restored if Iran won't guarantee
free navigation on the Shatt-al-Arab as well as agree to its being
dredged.
   The Khor Zouber port just west of the Shatt-al-Arab is entered
through the Khor Abdallah channel, which empties into the Persian
Gulf.
   The Shatt-al-Arab was Iraq's primary outlet to the gulf before
the war, but it has been blocked by sunken ships, unexploded
ordnance and an accumulation of eight years of silt.
   Asked if Iraq wishes to develop an alternative deep-water port,
Kittani replied, ``We'll have to'' if Iraq won't agree to begin
dredging and re-open the Shatt, known to Iran as the Arvand River.
   Clearing the Shatt will take two years, he said, adding that the
United Nations could be called in to help the dredging.
   ``The U.N. cleared the Suez Canal of ordnance two times'' after
wars in 1956 and 1973 between Israel and Egypt, Kittani noted.
   Iran insists the 1975 Algiers Treaty that defines their border as
running down the middle of the Shatt be maintained. President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq rejected the treaty in 1980.
   Asked how long Iraq was willing to continue the Geneva talks,
Kittani said: ``We are ready to stay there until hell freezes over
or until we reach complete agreement.''

   A conservation group today listed its choices
for the 10 most threatened national wildlife refuges and said that
without corrective action soon, ``some of them may die.''
   The Wilderness Society, in a report, recommended the Fish and
Wildlife Service find ways to better protect water quality on refuge
lands and give refuge managers more control.
   The Wildlife Service, in response, said the problems cited by the
conservation group ``are not new, nor are they being ignored.'' The
service manages 445 refuges.
   In no particular order, here are the 10 most endangered refuges
as listed by the Wilderness Society.
   _Kesterson, California. Described as ``in a coma'' because of
selenium poisoning from irrigation runoff that has killed thousands
of ducks and other waterfowl.
   _National Key Deer, Florida. As many as 20 percent of the deer in
this western Florida Keys refuge are killed by cars each year.
   _Loxahatchee, Florida. Nearby development has drastically changed
water flow patterns in this Everglades region, bringing periods of
both excessive and insufficient flow. The water is contaminated by
heavy fertilizer use.
   _Stillwater, Nevada. It has become a chemical ``dumping ground''
for the Newlands irrigation project. Mercury in fish has been found
at up to four times the amount permitted for human consumption.
   _Chincoteague, Virginia. A growing visitor population has put
pressure on wildlife nesting.
   _Yazoo, Mississippi. Agricultural runoff is carrying high
concentrations of pesticides into the refuge.
   _Arctic, Alaska. Oil companies and the Interior Department want
to explore for oil near the coast of the Beaufort Sea, which
Congress has not permitted.
   _Lower Rio Grande, Texas. Nearby pesticide spraying and runoff,
wastewater discharges and planned real estate development are the
major threats.
   _Upper Mississippi River, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and
Illinois. Soil erosion is damaging habitat and reproduction.
Wastewater and pesticide-loaded agricultural runoff is polluting
refuge waters and heavy recreation use is hurting habitat.
   _Great Swamp, New Jersey. Population growth 26 miles west of
Manhattan is straining two sewage treatment plants whose outflow
eventually reaches the refuge. Road salt, fertilizer and pesticides
are reaching the refuge. Old toxic dumps threaten contamination of
the water. Water flow is increasingly variable.
   The society identified these other wildlife refuges that it said
had less severe, but still serious, problems: Fallon, Nevada;
Bowdoin, Montana; Hakalau Forest, Hawaii; Upper Souris and J. Clark
Salyer, North Dakota; Ouray, Wyoming; Kenai, Alaska and Tule Lake,
California.

   The state Supreme Court has spared New
Jersey's only female death-row inmate, ruling she was not directly
to blame for the death of her goddaughter, whose last months were
spent in torture chained to a bathtub.
   Marie Moore, 42, of Paterson had been on death row since November
1984, when she was convicted of first-degree murder for the death of
Theresa Feury, an orphan who came to live with Ms. Moore.
   The girl died at age 13 in January 1983 of head injuries suffered
when she hit her head on the bathtub to which she was chained every
night. The girl's mummified body was found the following December in
an attic crawl space in Ms. Moore's house.
   The Supreme Court vacated Ms. Moore's death sentence Wednesday
and ordered a new trial on the murder charge. It did not disturb her
Passaic County Superior Court convictions for kidnapping, attempted
murder, terroristic threats and aggravated assault for which she is
serving 87{ years without eligibility for parole.
   The ruling was the first time the court found the death penalty
was improperly applied. Ms. Moore was the sole woman on New Jersey's
death row.
   ``We're pleased with the decision,'' said Roy Greenman, an
attorney who represented Ms. Moore.
   Greenman applauded the court's finding that the lower court erred
in failing to have jurors consider the lesser charges of
manslaughter or aggravated manslaughter.
   Joseph Falcone, the Passaic County prosecutor at the time and now
a Superior Court judge in Essex County, declined to comment. Passaic
County Prosecutor Ronald Fava also declined to comment, saying he
had not had time to digest the opinion.
   In an interview with The Associated Press in 1985, Ms. Moore, a
former hairdresser and telephone operator, said she had become a
fundamentalist Christian while in prison.
   The court ruled that ``if the medical evidence established that
Theresa Feury's death was caused by starvation or her weakened
medical condition, or by asphyxiation resulting from her being
wrapped and stuffed in a crawl space while alive, we would agree
with the state that a jury could find that Moore by her own conduct
caused Theresa's death.''
   ``The medical evidence presented in this record, however, does
not support that finding. According to the medical examiner, the
victim died as a result of blows to the head and face caused by
striking the tub,'' the court said. ``Marie Moore did not deal the
victim those fatal blows.''
   Court records show the girl fell against the tub after being
lifted by Ricky Flores, a boy who began living with the family in
the fall of 1981 when he was 14. Ricky became Ms. Moore's enforcer
and lover, according to the Supreme Court account.
   Flores served two years in a juvenile facility after a plea
bargain for his role in the girl's death, Greenman said. The youth
completed his sentence and was freed.
   According to testimony at Ms. Moore's trial, Theresa was starved,
forced to wear disposable diapers and hanged from her thumbs.
   Court records said the boy also was a victim of Ms. Moore's
attacks. Prosecutors said she met him and other victims through
friendships they had developed with her own daughter, who also lived
with the family.
   During the trial, the defense introduced testimony from a
psychiatrist that Ms. Moore suffered from psychological problems
that diminished her capacity to control herself. She told the
victims their punishments were ordered by a violent male she named
``Billy Joel.''
   Authorities said Ms. Moore's daughter was not a victim of abuse.

<HEAD>Nuclear-Powered U.S. Carrier And Support Ships Arriving In Persian
Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arrival of the nuclear-powered carrier
USS Nimitz and eight support ships in the Arabian Sea this weekend
will not change the number of Navy ships in the Persian Gulf region,
officials say.
   The new U.S. carrier contingent in Battle Group Bravo will
replace a similar unit led by the carrier Carl M. Vinson. Both
groups are part of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
   The change will leave the United States with 26 ships, one fewer
than on Aug. 20 when a cease-fire took effect in the 8-year war
between Iran and Iraq, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   The U.S. contingent is by far the largest of seven foreign naval
units in the region. About 16 U.S. ships, including six mine
sweepers, are in the gulf at any given time.
   The impending switch in U.S. carrier battle groups returns one of
the Navy's powerful Aegis-type missile cruisers to the area for the
first time since the USS Vincennes left.
   Officials said the USS Antietam, one of the newest of the
high-tech, billion-dollar warships, is making its first trip to the
region as a Nimitz escort.
   Other ships in the battle group are the nuclear cruiser
California, missile destroyers Waddell and Benjamin Stoddert,
frigate Barbey, ammunition ship Kiska, supply ship Mars and the
oiler Willamette.
   Pentagon officials say the American force in the gulf will be
scaled back to five or six ships if the truce continues to hold.
   That was the size of the Navy's Middle East Force when the war
escalated in mid-1987 and the United States began escorting
Kuwaiti-owned tankers that had been given U.S. registry and flew the
American flag.
   The officials have not disclosed a timetable, but military
sources say some reductions probably will come through attrition or
changing the orders of ships marked for gulf duty.
   Military sources say a U.S. carrier force probably will continue
to operate in the Indian Ocean for about half the time, as it did
before the gulf crisis.
   In the only force cutback to date, the Aegis-type cruiser Mobile
Bay had its orders for the gulf canceled Aug. 12, the day before it
was to leave for the Middle East to replace its sister ship, the
Vincennes.
   The Vincennes' departure in early September reduced the U.S.
strength to 26 ships.
   Although fleet strength has not been reduced further, the Navy
has curtailed air surveillance activities and ended the close
escorting of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the gulf.
   U.S. warships now monitor the tankers' movements, ready to
respond in case of trouble. No armed incidents have been reported in
the gulf since the truce, military and shipping officials say.
   Britain and Italy also have announced they no longer will
accompany commercial ships in convoy.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, after challenging
Michael Dukakis in states often ignored in presidential politics, is
plunging back into the hotly contested battle in California, warning
that the Democrats' definition of prosperity means high interest
rates.
   ``We don't need that kind of Democratic prosperity,'' Bush said
Wednesday, noting that the prime interest rate reached 21.5 percent
under the Carter administration, more than twice what it is now.
   ``We need the kind that Ronald Reagan has brought to this
country,'' Bush declared.
   After stops Wednesday in Detroit, Sioux Falls, S.D., and
Billings, Mont., Bush flew here for an endorsement today by a
maritime union and a rally. Washington is considered a tossup state.
   Then, he was heading for California where 47 electoral votes, the
largest prize in the nation, are at stake. Bush will spend two days
in California before heading back east.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said that in the 12 days
remaining before the election, ``We're going to focus on states
where we think the support is soft, where the margin is close.
   ``We're pleased and encouraged by the polls but we are going to
continue to work to make sure we've locked up the necessary
electoral votes,'' Fuller said.
   Bush made a point Wednesday of claiming that Michael Dukakis, his
Democratic opponent, would put in jeopardy the income tax cuts
enacted during the Reagan administration.
   He said Dukakis called the tax cuts ``one of the worst bills that
Congress ever could have passed.''
   ``Well, don't elect him cause he might just take that cut away
from the American people and I will not do that,'' Bush told a
cheering crowd of perhaps 2,000 people in a gymnasium at Rocky
Mountain College in Billings.
   A determined Dukakis supporter, a young woman who gave her name
as Victoria Brown, dashed back and forth through the audience with a
Dukakis sign until it was snatched away by someone in the crowd. She
tussled with her antagonist, and both were led away by a policeman.
   While Bush is waging a determined battle to win the 20 electoral
votes in Michigan, where he spent Wednesday morning, he had conceded
South Dakota during the primary session to then-rival Bob Dole.
   Taken together, South Dakota and Montana offer only seven of the
270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Wednesday's visit
was his only stop in each state in the general election campaign.
   Asked as he left Billings why he even bothered to stop there,
Bush replied, ``There's a lot at stake here. You've got two
congressional seats, you've got a governor's seat, you've got a
Senate seat, you've got the president and the vice president.
   ``So it is very, very important and it shows that we are taking
absolutely nothing for granted,'' the vice president told reporters.
   Recalling the words he had said inside the gym, Bush said, ``I am
running like I am behind, and I mean it. And we are not going to
lighten up at all.''
   In Billings, Air Force Two taxied to the runway for the flight to
Tacoma but then turned back when the galley crew reported gas fumes
in the rear of the plane. Fire fighting crews were sent to the plane
and the engines were turned off while an inspection was made.
   Bush and other members of his entourage remained on board. After
about 20 minutes, it was determined that strong cross winds had
blown fuel fumes into the aircraft and they would dissipate on
takeoff, as they did when the plane departed.
   Some time after Bush left, the press plane chartered by media
covering the vice president was held on the ground for a couple
hours because of high winds that prevented takeoff, Bush officials
said. It aborted three takeoffs because of a stalled engine before
finally departing.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brooklyn-born Rabbi Meir Kahane will be allowed
to travel here from Israel for a speaking tour while he challenges a
government finding that he had renounced his U.S. citizenship.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker on Wednesday ordered the
State Department not to interfere with Kahane's plan to enter the
United States early Thursday to begin a three-week speaking tour at
a suburban Washington synagogue.
   An attorney for Kahane, the founder of the militant Jewish
Defense League, argued in a hearing that Kahane only signed papers
renouncing his U.S. citizenship so he could retain his seat in the
Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
   Kahane sent a telegram to withdraw the renunciation after the
Israeli Supreme Court ruled his anti-Arab political party was racist
and therefore ineligible to participate in the Nov. 1 parliamentary
election.

   A ``Model Japanese Code of Conduct'' issued by
the head of the Congressional Black Caucus asks Japanese business to
expand minority training, work and management opportunity in its
American subsidiaries and to pull out of South Africa.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., issued the code Wednesday after he
held hearings on what he called insensitivity in Japan to Black

   Japan's ``extraordinary achievements'' in industry and technology
``are tainted by a narrow, egocentrist view of the human family,''
Dymally said in a preamble to the code.
   Dymally said he sent the model code to the Japanese Embassy and

   The Department of Transportation is requiring
three U.S. rocket companies to obtain up to $80 million in property
damage insurance coverage before using federal facilities for
commercial space launches.
   The orders call for $80 million in insurance for Martin Marietta
Corp. and for McDonnell Douglas Co., and $75 million for General
Dynamics Inc. Martin Marietta makes the Titan launch rocket,
McDonnell Douglas builds the Delta and Delta II, and General
Dynamics makes the Atlas-Centaur.
   Representatives of the rocket companies said Wednesday the
insurance demand was about what had been expected from the DOT.
   Orders were expected today to cover any liability claims by third
parties. Under terms of a commercial space transportation bill
passed by Congress and now on President Reagan's desk, the third
party liability requirement could be set as high as $500 million for
each launch.

   Larry Flynt offered a self-styled soldier of
fortune $1 million to kill rival sex magazine publishers Hugh Hefner
and Bob Guccione, and Frank Sinatra and Walter Annenberg,
authorities said.
   The purported hitman, Mitchell WerBell, died of a heart attack in
December 1983 about a month after Flynt gave him the check,
sheriff's Capt. Robert Grimm said Wednesday night. WerBell was in
his 60s when he died of natural causes, authorities said.
   Flynt's alleged motive was not disclosed and no charges have been
filed against him.
   Grimm told a news conference that information about the plot
turned up recently in an investigation of the 1983 murder-for-hire
slaying of New York theater producer Roy Radin, whom authorities
said was embroiled in a soured finance deal for the movie ``The
Cotton Club.''
   A former Flynt bodyguard, William Mentzer, is one of four
defendants charged in Radin's killing.
   Investigators have not interviewed the Hustler magazine publisher
and have not presented a case to the prosecutor, Grimm said. He
declined to elaborate and said Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman
Block spoke about the purported plot earlier in the day because he
had been approached by the news media.
   ``Our investigation is continuing,'' Grimm said.
   Grimm identified targets of the alleged plot as Hefner, Sinatra
and Guccione. He declined to name a fourth person targeted, but
authorities told KNBC-TV that person was Annenberg, the publishing
magnate and former ambassador.
   ``Larry Flynt one evening called an individual by the name of
WerBell to his home and allegedly offered him $1 million if he would
arrange for the death of these four individuals,'' said Block,
adding he took the matter seriously.
   ``I've been led to believe that Larry Flynt has a propensity to
try to harm people he sees as his enemies, whether (over) business
arrangements or whatever.''
   A woman at Flynt's office told The Associated Press Flynt ``just
said he doesn't make comments on trash like that.''
   WerBell was an international arms dealer who developed the MAC-10
submachine gun. He called himself a retired general of the Royal
Free Afghan Army, according to promotional material from his
Georgia-based counterterrorism firm, Sionics Inc., released by the
sheriff's department.
   Grimm displayed a photocopy of a $1 million check allegedly
signed by Flynt and made out to WerBell.
   Block said a Flynt associate immediately stopped payment on the
check so it never was negotiated.
   The year of the alleged plot, Flynt claimed to have knowledge of
videotapes purportedly showing Vicki Morgan, mistress of the late
Diners Club founder Alfred Bloomingdale, engaged in sexual antics
with Reagan administration officials.
   The tapes were never proven to exist.
   At the time, Flynt was heavily sedated with drugs to assuage pain
from wounds that left him paralyzed after a 1978 assassination
attempt during an obscenity trial in Georgia.
   Hefner, publisher of Playboy magazine, said his place on the list
was the price of celebrity. ``It's part of being famous in the later
part of the 20th century,'' he said in a statement. ``I have no
association with those who made up the list or those whose names
appear on it.''
   Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, said he had been
informed about the alleged plot by a Flynt bodyguard some time ago.
   Susan Reynolds, publicist for Sinatra, said the entertainer had
no comment.
   A telephone call to Annenberg's Palm Springs home was answered by
a woman who said he was on the East Coast and wouldn't be
immediately available for comment.

   Researchers say fishermen using more sophisticated
equipment are catching fish before they are old enough to spawn,
causing the number of mature cod in New England waters to plummet.
   A recent study found that just 30 percent of the cod in the rich
Georges Bank fishing area that were alive at the beginning of 1987
survived to the beginning of 1988. The high mortality rate poses a
threat to the cod population and the $40 million-a-year New England
industry it supports.
   Also, studies found that the spawning stock of Georges Bank cod
declined for the fifth consecutive year in 1988 to 68.1 million
pounds, the lowest in the 11 years that stock size has been
calculated.
   ``It's clear that the fishing effort is at record high levels,''
said Fredric M. Serchuk, chief of off-shore fishery resources
investigation for the federal Northeast Fisheries Center in Woods
Hole.
   ``The fishermen are very dependent on small young fish,'' he
said. ``As a result, when there has been successful spawning, the
fish don't remain in the population long enough to contribute to the
spawning stock.''
   The number of fishing vessels, days spent at sea and fishing trip
duration is increasing, Serchuk said. Fishermen also have become
more efficient by using more sophisticated fish-finding equipment.
   The fisheries center estimates that the 1988 commercial catch of
Georges Bank cod will be about 52.5 million pounds, about 25 percent
higher than in 1987.
   The increased 1988 catch is due to record-high fishing levels by
the region's 1,600 fishermen who fish for cod and other bottom fish,
and an above-average number of cod hatched in 1985.
   But with a high mortality rate, the 1985 generation is being
depleted quickly. For 1989, Serchuk forecast a low supply of cod
because the number of fish hatched in 1986 that would be catchable
next year appears low.
   According to the fisheries center, the survival rate for Georges
Bank cod has fallen from about 65 percent in 1978 to 30 percent last
year.
   Another problem has been a 1984 World Court decision that created
a territorial boundary line in Georges Bank about halfway between
Cape Cod and Nova Scotia, barring American fishermen from prime
waters now belonging to Canada. The boundary means the same number
of fishermen are restricted to a smaller area.
   Cod is the predominant species landed in the U.S. Atlantic,
generally accounting for more catch by weight than other bottom fish
such as haddock and yellow-tailed flounder.

   A judge's decision has forced Rep. Pat Swindall to
fight an uphill battle for re-election while under a perjury
indictment. But he has said he hasn't lost any moral high ground to
his opponent, former actor Ben Jones.
   In one of the nation's bitterest campaigns, Swindall, R-Ga., has
repeatedly brought up his Democratic rival's admitted alcoholism and
past brushes with the law. Jones, who played ``Cooter'' on
television's ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' has proposed in turn that
Swindall be tested for drug use and psychiatric problems.
   The battle returned to the limelight Wednesday when U.S. District
Judge Robert Vining halted the two-term congressman's trial on 10
perjury counts until after the Nov. 8 election.
   Swindall's high-speed strategy of representing himself as his own
attorney amid the campaign backfired when Vining brought into court
two recent campaign mailings, one of which mentioned Swindall's
claim that a private polygraph test supports his defense.
   Vining, who disallowed a polygraph test as evidence in the trial,
said the literature might influence jurors. He also said he wanted
the Justice Department to investigate whether Swindall violated
court rules governing comments lawyers may make outside the
courtroom.
   The judge then dismissed the jury and later rejected Swindall's
last attempt at a quick trial, a request that Vining hear the case
without a jury. Prosecutor Craig Gillen also was willing to allow
Vining to render the verdict, but federal court rules also require
the judge's consent.
   Swindall, who had demanded his own indictment from the floor of
the House, said he ``very much would have liked to have had an
exoneration before the election.''
   ``However, I knew that with a campaign with only two weeks to go,
and with the issue of perjury uppermost in many people's minds, that
it was important for me to get that polygraph evidence out to the
voters of the 4th District, because it totally exonerates me,'' he
said.
   Swindall is accused of lying to a grand jury when he said he did
not remember being told that an $850,000 home mortgage loan he was
seeking might be coming from illegal drug proceeds. Swindall
negotiated the loan with a money broker who turned out to be an
undercover federal agent, and the prosecution has a recording of the
agent telling Swindall he had a ``gut feeling'' drugs were involved.
   Jones would not comment on the case. ``We had an 18-point lead
before the indictment, and we got it not because of his problems,
but because of our hard work,'' he said.
   A poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution after Swindall's Oct.
17 indictment found the challenger leading 53-27 percent.
   ``We're going to run the last two weeks of this campaign just as
we had planned to _ not talking about Pat Swindall at all,'' Jones
said. ``We're going to be talking about Ben Jones and taking the
high road.''
   Nonetheless, the campaign has featured Swindall's repeated
questions about Jones' own legal problems and his admitted bout with
alcoholism.
   During his drinking days, Jones acknowledged, he was arrested on
several occasions for what he called ``stupid alcoholic behavior,''
referring to old disorderly conduct charges.
   Swindall also called for new debates Wednesday and said Jones
recently had avoided them, adding, ``if I held positions that are so
clearly liberal, I wouldn't want to face the voters'' either.
   Jones denied ducking Swindall. He said he has debated the
congressman eight times and claimed Swindall declined seven
invitations to attend forums with Jones.
   But he said his schedule for the remainder of the campaign is
already set and will not include debates.
   Swindall said he will ask voters to support him with the
understanding he would resign if convicted. That approach, he said,
would ensure that a new Republican candidate could enter the
subsequent special election.
   ``I believe they will re-elect me with the understanding that an
exoneration after the election is just as good as an exoneration
before the election,'' he said.

<HEAD>Family Planners Claim Success in Holding Down Population Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese family planners today claimed a slackening
of the population explosion in the first half of this year, but said
keeping the growth rate at manageable levels will not be easy.
   Li Honggui, a senior official in the Family Planning Commission,
also disclosed at a news conference that there were 10.39 million
abortions, 46 for every 100 live births, in China last year.
   China denies it forces women to undergo abortions, although local
officials are said to exert heavy pressure on women with unplanned
pregnancies to abort.
   According to a nationwide survey of 500,000 households, there
were 8.84 births and 3.39 deaths per thousand people in the first
six months of 1988, for a natural increase of 5.45 per thousand.
   Li and other members of the survey team said that compared to
10.04 births in the first half of 1987 and 23.26 births for that
entire year.
   ``Offices at various levels strengthened their work at the
grassroots level,'' Liang Jimin, deputy chief of the survey team
said in explaining the decrease.
   Li stressed that the survey, conducted by 20,000 people, was
accurate. The Communist Party's official People's Daily reported
last week that there has been serious underreporting of births from
many rural areas because family planning officials file false
reports to meet unrealistic birth targets.
   Li said the target of keeping China's population, 1.08 billion at
the end of 1987, down to 1.2 billion in the year 2000 will not be
met if there is any letup in population control policies.
   Chinese population experts have said the country could have up to
1.28 billion people at the turn of the century if a recent
population boom continues.
   The nationwide growth rate climbed from 11 per thousand in 1985
to 16.16 in 1987 as a baby boom generation of the early 1960s
reached child-bearing age.
   The faster growth rate is a result of a relaxation of China's
one-child-per-family policy. Although most couples in cities are
allowed only one child, couples in rural areas are generally allowed
two, particularly if the first child is a girl.
   Rural families want boys to help work the land and carry on the
family name, and many newly affluent peasants are willing to pay
large fines for exceeding birth quotas until they produce a boy.
   Zhang Pei, deputy director of the Department of Education and
Communication in the Family Planning Commission, said families that
produce unplanned babies are usually fined 10 to 15 percent of their
annual incomes, with the money going to welfare facilities. He said
some families have been fined up to $540, more than four times the
average per capita annual income in the countryside.

   More than 100 people were feared drowned
after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river junction in southern
Bangladesh, police said today.
   Fifteen bodies were recovered and 94 people were reported missing
in the sinking Wednesday night where the Ilisha and Tetulia rivers
meet and join the Meghna, police and a district administrator said.
   Another ferry was attacked by river pirates near Chandpur late
Tuesday, police said. Six passengers, including a pregnant woman,
were thrown overboard and have not been found, Chandpur police said.
   About 200 passengers were wounded when the pirates fired rifles
and hurled homemade bombs before making off with about $83,000 in
local currency, police said.
   The ferry that sank was carrying more than double its authorized
capacity of 100 passengers, police said. They said about 100 people
on the ferry's roof swam to safety but most of those in the hull
were unable to save themselves.
   The ferry was traveling from Mehendiganj to the island town of
Bhola, about 68 miles southeast of Dhaka, when it sank in 22 feet of
water.
   Police said six bodies were found in the hull of the ferry, the
M.L. Sonali, and nine others were found more than a mile downstream.
   Two independent newspapers in Dhaka, Ittefaq and Sangbad, quoted
survivors as saying the ferry went out of control while trying to
negotiate a turn.
   The pirate attack on the second ferry, the M.V. Sagar, also
occurred on the Meghna River. The Sagar was en route from Dhaka to
Barisal when about 50 pirates launched their attack near Chandpur,
34 miles southeast of Dhaka.
   The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as passengers, opened fire
and exploded bombs shortly before midnight Tuesday as people were
bedding down for the night, Chandpur police said.
   The attackers escaped in waiting boats, the police added. They
said 44 of the injured passengers were hospitalized, including four
in critical condition.

   A man revealed to his 9-year-old daughter
that a Pennsylvania couple claims she is their child and was mixed
up at birth with another infant, but he insisted he will not allow
tests to prove it.
   Robert W. Mays, a 43-year-old roofing supply salesman, identified
himself for the first time Wednesday as the father of the girl,
Kimberly Michelle Mays. He said he decided to step forward for fear
that she would be told by someone else who might frighten her.
   ``It took me a long time to realize the seriousness of this
situation,'' he said. ``At first, I thought it was at terrible
joke.''
   Regina and Ernest Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., claim the girl was
born to them but was swapped with another child soon after birth in
1978 at a Florida hospital. The girl they raised as a daughter died
in August of a heart defect.
   During a news conference at his attorney's office, Mays said he
told his daughter a week ago of the Twiggs' months-long battle to
require her to submit to genetic blood tests to prove her parentage.
   ``It was the most difficult thing I ever had to do in my life,''
he said. ``For a moment there was panic in her eyes. She said,
`Daddy, I don't want to move away.'''
   ``Does it mean I'm not your little girl?'' she asked.
   Mays said he reassured the blond fourth-grader that he was her
father and nothing would change, then she settled down.
   ``It was the only time during our hour talk she stopped me. It
was all that was important to her. She wanted to make sure
everything was still in place, then (she asked) could she go ride
her bike,'' Mays said.
   Mays said the Twiggs have presented no evidence to show Kimberly
could be their daughter. And even if genetic tests supported their
claim, Mays said he would not surrender her.
   ``I would fight to the ends of the earth for her,'' he said.
   ``I wouldn't care if they traced her heritage to Cabbage Patch
U.S.A., she is my daughter.''
   An attorney for the Twiggs, William Post, said Mays was
``irresponsible'' for coming forward.
   ``The Twiggs were terribly distressed and amazed that he would do
a thing like that, ... that he would call a press conference and
expose a child to this kind of publicity, Post said.
   The Twiggs have said their daughter, a healthy girl, was switched
in a baby-selling scheme at Hardee Memorial Hospital in Wauchula for
a sickly child. Hospital workers then altered records to hide the
swap, they allege.
   Kimberly was born at the hospital in late 1978, about the same
time as the daughter the Twiggs raised, Arlena. The couple said
genetic tests this summer proved Arlena was not their biological
daughter.
   The Twiggs filed a $100 million suit against the hospital and
some of its employees and persuaded the FBI to investigate. The FBI
failed to find sufficient evidence that federal law had been
violated.
   This month, the Twiggs asked a judge in Sarasota to force
Kimberly to submit to sophisticated genetic tests to determine if
she has O-positive blood like theirs. But Mays said he also has
O-type blood and doesn't know what type Kimberly has.
   The judge has yet to rule on whether the testing should be
required.
   Mays said he hopes his disclosure will help avoid a long legal
battle that could evolve into a custody fight with the Twiggs.
   ``We want them to please, think about this child and not cause
trauma in her life,'' he said.

<HEAD>Presidential Dead Heat in New York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidential race in New York remains a
virtual dead heat between Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis and
Republican George Bush, according to a poll published today.
   Bush led Dukakis by 46-44 percent in the New York Post statewide
survey of 677 registered voters who were questioned Sunday.
   The difference was well within the poll's margin of error of plus
or minus five percentage points. It indicated little shift since a
Post poll a month ago put Bush less than half a percentage point
ahead of Dukakis.
   With 36 electoral votes, New York is second only to California in
importance in the Electoral College.
   ``This is literally a dead-even race, a very close election in
New York, said pollster Arthur Finkelstein, whose firm, Diversified
Research Inc., conducted the telephone survey.

   Portions are big enough for three, and what else
would one expect at a restaurant called Triplets?
   What's remarkable is that none of the three owners knew they were
triplets until age 19, when they met and became best friends,
roommates, classmates and, eventually, business partners.
   Robert Shafran, Eddy Galland and David Kellman were born on Long
Island 27 years ago, adopted at birth and raised in the area. Not
even their adoptive parents knew they were triplets, said Galland.
   ``We were all fat kids with brown curly hair, and we knew we were
adopted. We were comfortable with it,'' he said.
   In 1979, Galland went to Sullivan County Community College, but
transferred the next year. ``Bobby came the next semester to
Sullivan, and my friends thought I was back,'' Galland said.
   One friend asked Shafran his birth date and whether he was
adopted, and then told him he probably had a twin. News stories were
published about the brothers, and when Kellman saw one, he realized
the twins were triplets.
   On Sept. 18, 1980, they met.
   ``It was like we always knew each other. It was instant _ an
incredible feeling,'' said Galland. ``We knew immediately that we
wanted to spend a lot of time together.''
   ``It was total excitement,'' said Kellman. ``It was electric.''
   They all transferred to City University of New York, rented an
apartment, got a parrot named Zack, and turned down book offers.
   They earned degrees in business and international marketing.
   Eventually, they got jobs at Sammy's Famous Roumanian Restaurant,
a boistrous, Lower East Side institution known for huge portions and
familial atmosphere.
   They learned their lessons well, and in January opened Triplets
Roumanian Restaurant in the Soho section of Manhattan, serving
similar ambiance and abundant, Eastern European food.
   It seats 200, and while people come in as strangers, the brothers
try to make sure they don't leave that way.
   Intentionally just a tad tacky, Triplets has a big awning with
cartoon faces of the owners outside; inside, on three levels, there
are mauve banquettes, mirrors and dozens of color photographs of
diners having the time of their lives.
   There are T-shirts and coffee mugs, decorated with the triplets'
mugs. A Triplets club offers discounts and special events. On each
table is a light-hearted, comic book-style version of the brothers'
story.
   Sometimes, there are comedians, belly dancers, musicians,
sing-alongs. The words to such songs as ``Hava Nagila'' and ``New
York, New York'' are printed in the menus.
   ``People walk in and say, `Who's the bar mitzvah boy?''' said
Shafran.
   The brothers divide chores, but Shafran said: ``All of us talk
about what we're looking for. We can cover each other's
responsibilities. Our paths cross constantly.''
   And they clown around almost constantly. They tell half jokes,
laughing before anyone on the outside has heard enough to get them.
   Sitting recently around a table in their restaurant, the brothers
are distinguishable _ Shafran's the largest, Kellman the smallest.
Kellman also is reputed to be the most level-headed, Galland the
most volatile. Shafran and Kellman are married; Galland is single.
   But there's no doubt they're triplets.
   They're gregarious, show signs of working out, and dress
fashionably. Each had a similar upbringing with upper middle-class
Jewish families. They've been studied by researchers looking at
similarities and differences among separated twins and triplets.
   Galland said they are not interested in finding their biological
parents, and won't discuss the subject.
   But they'll talk plenty about the comforts of home they offer at
Triplets.
   Huge portions of steak, veal chops or chicken, stuffed cabbage,
chopped liver, chicken soup, mashed potatoes with chicken cracklings
and potato pancakes.
   Syrup pitchers of schmaltz (rendered chicken fat) sit on each
table, along with blue siphons of seltzer. The seltzer is essential
for the egg creams diners with any appetite left mix up after
dessert, using the traditional Fox's U-Bet chocolate syrup and milk.
   Why such fare when Americans are being urged to cut down on fat
and salt?
   ``We don't expect to see the same people every night. Let people
have their whole-grain rice and their sushi five nights a week and
then come here,'' said Galland. ``I can't tell you how many times
people say, `I haven't eaten like this since my mother was alive, or
since my grandmother was alive.'''

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while share prices rose moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 125.90 yen, down 0.90 yen from Wednesday's
close of 126.80 yen. Opening at 125.95 yen, the currency moved
within a range of 125.80 yen to 126.15 yen.
   The dollar tumbled following a U.S. Commerce Department report
Wednesday that the nation's gross national product, the main
economic indicator, grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the
third quarter, after increasing at 3.4 percent in the first quarter
and 3 percent in the second quarter.
   Dealers said the market had expected a 3 percent to 3.5 percent
increase and the low growth rate pushed the dollar down.
   Takamasa Yamasaki of Daiwa Bank said the Bank of Japan intervened
in the market shortly after trading started to support the dollar.
   ``But it is unlikely that only the BOJ's intervention helped the
dollar recover,'' he said, adding that if the dollar fell to the
125-yen level again the central bank would intervene.
   The bank does not comment publicly on its activities.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 199.11-point
winner Wednesday, gained another 102.31 points, or 0.37 percent, to
finish trading at 27,722.92.
   ``Concern over inflation and higher interest rates in the United
States is gone now, and investors are showing strong interest in
buying stocks,'' said a dealer with a major securities firm in
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Watergate Felon Advising Bush Campaign, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Nixon White House aide Dwight L.
Chapin, who was imprisoned because he lied about his connection to
political dirty tricks during the Watergate scandal, is serving as
an unpaid staff adviser to George Bush's presidential campaign, a
published report today said.
   Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin, asked whether it was
appropriate for a Watergate felon to be working as a campaign
adviser, told the San Jose Mercury News, ``It's not as if the guy
has not paid his debt to society.''
   ``We feel that he ought to be allowed to participate in the
process at this point,'' Goodin said.
   A document distributed by Bush's campaign headquarters last month
to state Republican officials lists Chapin as one of four ``senior
advisers'' to the scheduling and events unit of the national Bush
campaign. A copy of the two-page document was obtained by the
Mercury News.
   Chapin was found to have lied about his dealings with Donald H.
Segretti, a practitioner of campaign infiltration and sabotage whom
Chapin hired for the 1972 Nixon re-election campaign.
   ``His background is advance work,'' Goodin told the newspaper,
referring to Chapin. ``And that's been his strong suit. ... My
understanding of his (Chapin's) role is that from time to time he
consults on some big events on advance techniques.''
   Chapin, who was President Nixon's appointments secretary from
1969 to 1973, was convicted of two counts of perjury in April 1973
and served six months in prison for lying to a federal grand jury
that was investigating the Watergate scandal.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major events in the attempts to free the
trapped whales in Barrow, Alaska:
   Oct. 13 _ Three California gray whales are discovered trapped in
ice east of Point Barrow. They apparently became stuck a week
before. Biologists are unable to contact an icebreaking ship to give
aid.
   Oct. 14 _ Whales continue to swim several hundred feet offshore,
using two holes in the ice to breathe. Biologists believe time is
running out for the grays as temperatures drop to minus 13 degrees,
threatening to shrink the whales' breathing space. Efforts fail
again to contact an icebreaker.
   Oct. 18 _ Biologist says one whale may have pneumonia, as an
Alaska Army National Guard Skycrane helicopter sets out to tow a
185-ton Hovercraft-type icebreaking barge 200 miles northwest to the
whales. President Reagan telephones with his support.
   Oct. 19 _ Eskimos cut new holes in the ice, but the barge effort
is hampered by shallow water. Biologists say the whales' health
appears stabilized, and that they are handling their captivity
better than first believed.
   Oct. 20 _ Barge begins its journey but moves only six miles
through sand bars, mud and shallow water. Two Minnesota
brothers-in-law arrive with de-icers to enlarge breathing holes for
the whales.
   Oct. 21 _ One of the whales, nicknamed ``Bone,'' disappears and
is presumed dead. Rescuers try ``Plan B:'' a 5-ton concrete
``bullet'' wielded by a helicopter loaned by the National Guard. An
easterly wind opens ``leads,'' or open water, through the ice within
four miles of the whales. The Soviet Union offers an icebreaker to
help in the rescue.
   Oct. 22 _ Eskimos using chain saws lead the whales almost a
half-mile closer to open water by carving 24 breathing holes in the
ice. The Skycrane dropping its ``bullet'' punches four 15-to-20-foot
holes in the ice at 75-yard intervals, but a massive pressure ridge
of ice stands in the way.
   Oct. 24 _ Whales, apparently spooked by shallower water over a
shoal, reverse course, retreating 800 yards towards shore.
Scientists probe the ice ridge for a weak spot that arriving Soviet
icebreakers could attack.
   Oct. 25 _ Two Soviet icebreakers arrive and begin work smashing
through the ice ridge. The whales follow a detour cut by Eskimos
using chain saws around the shoal they had refused to pass.
   Oct. 26 _ The Soviet ships move within a quarter-mile of the line
of breathing holes. Rescuers used a gargantuan, tractor-like device
propelled by pontoon augers to clear the ice cut by the ships. The
whales moved into the new waterway cut by the vessels, and were seen
swimming in the channel that leads to the open sea.

   When David Katz made his motion before Judge Julia
Nowicki, Her Honor eyed him with great seriousness, then performed
the opening strains of ``Marche Militaire Francaise.''
   No, they aren't a pair of comics. They're members of the Chicago
Bar Association Symphony Orchestra, a 47-member ensemble of lawyers
who want to make motions in music as well as in the courtroom.
   ``It's a real nice break,'' said Ms. Nowicki, 40, a domestic
relations judge by day, cellist by night with the 2-year-old
orchestra.
   ``It's real nice to be with lawyers and not fighting.''
   Katz, the orchestra's conductor, is the only non-lawyer among the
performers, who get together once a week in Ms. Nowicki's courtroom
for practice.
   About 30 lawyer-musicians were free of their legal duties
Wednesday night when Katz brought down the baton for the orchestra's
fall debut _ its ninth performance since its founding.
   Saint-Saens' ``Marche Militaire'' was followed by Rossini's
``Overture to The Barber of Seville,'' Sir Arthur Sullivan's
``Overture to H.M.S. Pinafore'' and a tribute to another Illinois
lawyer, ``Lincoln Portrait,'' by Aaron Copland.
   Asked to assess the performance, Ms. Nowicki _ whose only formal
music training came during her years in the Chicago public school
system _ at first didn't want to have any part of what might be
self-incriminating testimony.
   But she finally allowed, judiciously, that it was ``pretty good.''
   What the orchestra lacks in musicianship, it makes up in spirit
and seriousness.
   ``I did this only for you,'' bassoonist Carl Silberman told Katz
at the end of the performance in paneled hall at the University Club.
   ``I came into the Rossini cold,'' he added, explaining that he
had never before played the composition.
   Katz, who heads the Adrian (Mich.) Symphony Orchestra, said one
of the pleasant challenges of working with the lawyers is the
variety of ability and experience they bring to their performance.
   ``They take it very seriously, but it's fun for them and that's
what makes it fun to conduct this orchestra,'' said Katz.
   The lawyers' orchestra has its orgin at a Chicago Symphony Chorus
``Messiah'' concert in which amateur singers and musicians perform
with professionals.
   Ms. Nowicki, one of the ``Messiah'' participants, discovered she
was sitting next to another cellist-lawyer. Why not get lawyers
together to make music, they thought.
   ``Part of being a lawyer is the ability to focus in on the work
they do,'' said Katz. ``I think lawyers are all performers at heart
and they always rise to the occasion.''
   Practice is a little nerve-wracking for the courthouse guards
when the players file in for practice.
   Just what might be in those black cases? Everyone's seen the
movies of Prohibition Era gangsters and their machine guns.
   ``This is Chicago, and walking into the courthouse with violin
cases was a real problem for the guards,'' said Katz.
   But everything considered, the musician-lawyers do well, he said.
   ``It's good therapy.''

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino today
threatened to shut down the company whose passenger ship sailed into
Typhoon Ruby and sank with hundreds of people aboard.
   Authorities ordered the owners to explain why they should not
lose their license for letting the vessel sail into a storm whose
winds reached 140 mph.
   The latest casualty figures indicate just 197 people survived the
sinking Monday of the 2,855-ton Dona Marilyn in heavy seas about 300
miles southeast of Manila.
   The coast guard said an undetermined number of others reached a
small island more than 100 miles west of where the ship sank. At
least 33 bodies have been recovered, officials said.
   Some survivors remain in shock and were refusing to be flown from
the islands where they washed ashore, coast guard officials said
today.
   The ship's manifest showed 431 passengers and a crew of 60. But
coast guard officials said the headcount at sailing time was 379
passengers.
   Today, Mrs. Aquino told reporters she had ordered the Department
of Transportation to investigate Sulpicio Lines, which owned the
Dona Marilyn and another passenger ship that sank 10 months ago with
more than 3,000 casualties.
   The Dona Paz, Dona Marilyn's sister ship, collided with an oil
tanker last December off Mindoro Island. Only 28 people survived.
   ``If it is necessary to suspend operations of Sulpicio Lines,
then I would do so,'' Mrs. Aquino said. On Wednesday, she said
investigators should determine why the Dona Marilyn sailed despite
the typhoon's approach.
   Philip Tuazon, administrator of the government's Maritime
Industry Authority, said his organization had ordered Sulpicio ``to
explain why we should not suspend them.''
   Sulpicio President Carlos Go said he could not explain why the
vessel sailed from Manila on schedule Sunday morning for Tacloban,
350 miles southeast, although the storm was approaching the eastern
Philippines.
   Go said he would have to speak first with surviving crew but
added: ``During Sunday, when they left Manila, the weather was
clear.''
   In Tacloban, Sulpicio station manager Bernardo Cabigon said the
Dona Marilyn's skipper was not among the confirmed survivors but
that the chief mate and two other officers were reported safe on
Almagro Island.
   Capt. Daniel Delgado, Philippine coast guard chief of staff, said
the vessel was allowed to sail because no typhoon warning had been
issued for the Manila area at the time.
   But Nanette Lumarda, chief of the government weather service's
tropical cyclones secton, said Ruby developed into a tropical storm
as early as 8 p.m. Friday about 645 miles east of Mindanao Island.
   At 11 a.m. Sunday, one hour after the Dona Marilyn sailed, the
weather service issued a bulletin warning that Ruby had grown into a
typhoon and was moving west-northwest toward the Visayas Islands,
she said.
   She added that on Sunday afternoon, about 24 hours before the
Dona Marilyn sank, the weather service issued an international
shipping advisory warning of ``rough to very high seas'' along the
route of the stricken vessel. She said warnings were updated every
six hours.
   Vicente Gambito, a Sulpicio vice president, said the company
received a message early Monday from the Dona Marilyn that it was
buffeted by giant waves south of Masbate island.
   Gambito said the company ordered the captain to change course for
the west, using Masbate as a shield against the storm. Five hours
later, the captain radioed the ship was taking in water and the
condition was ``critical,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Go said 139 survivors were aboard another company
ship, the Princess, and expected in Tacloban later today. He said
the others were still on Maripipi, Almagro and other small islands
near where the vessel sank.
   Lt. Edmund Luscre, coast guard operations chief in Iloilo, said
an undetermined number of survivors reached Sicogon, a tiny resort
island off the coast of Panay. Sicogon is about 100 miles west of
where the ship sank.

   Those involved in freeing two California
gray whales from their icy enclave said the experience left a
lasting impression.
   ``This is the wildest thing that's ever happened to me,'' said
Craig George, one of two North Slope Borough wildlife biologists who
babysat the whales since they were found two weeks ago trapped in
ice so thin it wouldn't support a man's weight.
   ``It's crazy. It doesn't make any sense, but it's wonderful,''
George said.
   He said that at first, he didn't think the whales could be freed.
   ``No, I thought it was one of those exercises in futility that
you had to do,'' he said. ``I learned a lot. I learned that with
persistence, clear thinking and proper chain saws, you can do
anything.''
   His colleague, Geoff Carroll, who shared the vigil for night
after cold, lonely night, said he was more optimistic from the
beginning.
   ``It was just one of those things where you start out, and see
what happens. I guess I always believed we'd get them out, but I
never thought it would turn out the way it did.''
   Whaling captain Arnold Brower also spent countless hours on the
ice, offering his expertise and mobilizing the Eskimos who kept the
whales alive and moving toward safety by cutting a path of more than
100 breathing holes.
   ``I'm really relieved,'' he said. ``I feel like my burden may be
lifted.''
   Rescue coordinator Ron Morris said he never had any doubts about
the eventual success of the operation, which ended with the whales
following the path cut by a Soviet icebreaker.
   Rick Skluzacek and Greg Ferrian, Minnesotans who showed up
uninvited to provide de-icing equipment that enabled rescuers to
keep the breathing holes open, were elated.
   ``Great,'' Skluzacek said of the whales' escape. ``Anything more
than that one-word answer is too much. You can't describe the
feeling.
   ``I couldn't feel better now, no way, shape or how,'' he said as
he went off to look for a cigar to celebrate.
   ``It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' said Ferrian,
Skuzacek's brother-in-law. ``But if anybody asked me to do it again,
I'd say no.''
   The environmental group Greenpeace hailed the spirit of
cooperation that characterized the rescue.
   ``These whales showed us the way toward global consciousness and
true international cooperation,'' Campbell Plowden, the group's
whale campaign coordinator, said in a statement released in
Washington, D.C. ``If this much attention would only be paid to the
plight of the hundreds of whales harpooned each year by Japan,
Iceland and Norway, the whales could truly be saved.''
   President Reagan praised the rescue in a statement from the White
House. ``The human persistence and determination by so many
individuals on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for
the environment,'' he said. ``It has been an inspiring endeavor.''
   The Soviet news agency Tass noted those comments in its report on
the story today.

   The meter showed the equivalent of
$53,346 when London cabbie Guy Smith drove into the record books
today after a 69-day journey that started in front of Buckingham
Palace.
   ``I can't believe we're really here,'' said an elated Smith as he
pulled up in a familiar black cab at the steps of the Sydney Opera
House.
   The 14,148-mile Great London to Sydney taxi ride was set up to
raise money for children's charities.
   ``So much has happened, what an amazing adventure,'' Smith, 57,
shouted as he sprayed a magnum of champagne over the vehicle.
``We've seen the Taj Mahal, the Bangkok Palace, we've had prime
ministers in the car, half an elephant _ even a camel.''
   Organizers estimated the trip _ through Europe, Turkey, Iran,
Pakistan, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore before crossing to
Australia _ would raise $320,000 from sponsors.
   ``We set out with three objectives: the longest and most
expensive taxi ride in history to raise money for children's
charities during the (Australian) bicentennial,'' said Smith. ``Its
been the adventure of a liftime.''
   The taxi left London Aug. 19 with four drivers, John Morgan,
Edward Kelly, Sydney taxi driver Kanelli Tsiros and Smith. They were
accompanied by support vehicles as they wound their way across
deserts, unpaved roads and the Outback to make the entry into the
Guinness Book of World Records.
   Smith said the drive went off without a hitch. He didn't change
the tires once or have a puncture and said mechanical failures were
minor. But he said drivers in Turkey are the world's worst.
   Organizers said the cab will be sold at auction later and the
money given to an Australian children's charity.
   Miss Tsiros, the Sydney cabbie, said the journey gave her the
opportunity to see her 11-year-old foster son, Santosh Babru, in
Bombay. Tsiros donates $20 a month to a foster parents group for his
upkeep.
   Said she: ``Now I know it is money well spent.''

<TEXT>
   Now and then, Peggy Say allows herself to think
about what would happen if Terry Anderson does not come home. The
brother she has not seen in 3{ years marked his 41st birthday today
still in captivity.
   ``I tried to think what if he didn't come back, what if they
killed him. I don't know what I would do because I would be so
angry,'' Mrs. Say said during a recent interview at her home in a
lakeside community near Cadiz.
   Anderson's birthday, his fourth in captivity since he was
abducted March 16, 1985, in Beirut was being celebrated with
parties, prayer services and rallies by friends and well-wishers
from the Middle East to his home town of Batavia, N.Y.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the 14 foreign hostages abducted in
Lebanon. He was kidnapped by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction
called Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.
   ``We aren't forgetting him,'' said Terri Fritz of Batavia's radio
station WBAT, which along with a merchants group sponsored a
birthday party with a huge cake decorated with 1,321 candles, one
for each day of captivity.
   In Lebanon, seven newspapers published a letter to Anderson on
the eve of his birthday from a group of journalists working for his
release.
   ``We join our hearts with yours in yearning for your freedom. We
greet you, we salute you and we encourage you,'' said the letter
from the Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson. ``All free
men and women who live by the pen share ... in your captivity.''
   Mrs. Say, 47, who planned to spend Anderson's birthday with
family and friends in New York City, has devoted most of her energy
since his abduction to gaining his release.
   While she has tried to contemplate the worst, she and her
husband, David, are hopeful her brother will see freedom by the
presidential election, less than two weeks away.
   ``It's such an agony of anticipation,'' Mrs. Say said. ``Having
been burned so many times in the past, you try not to think about
it.''
   Something else she would prefer not to think about is how to tell
her brother of the family changes that have occurred during his
absence.
   Their father, Glenn R. Anderson died of cancer in February 1986.
Four months later, their 46-year-old brother, Glenn Jr., died of
cancer. He died four days after making a videotape from his bed
appealing to Anderson's captors.
   Anderson's daughter Gabrielle, who was 10 years old when he was
kidnapped, is now a teen-ager. He has yet to meet a second daughter,
Sulome, whose third birthday was June 7.
   Mrs. Say, a quiet woman with piercing brown eyes, has led
candlelight vigils outside the White House and had coffee with
President Reagan. In 1986, she made a 5,000-mile trip to the
Mideast, and she has appeared on national talk shows.
   ``I simply want my brother back,'' she said.
   Today, students at Buffalo State College in New York planned to
hold a rally on Anderson's behalf, while in Catskill, south of
Albany, parishioners of St. Patrick's church scheduled a prayer
service.
   ``We see it as a chance to sensitize students to the issues of
freedom,'' said Paul DeWald, a journalism professor who organized
the rally. ``Terry is Joe America to us and we have to stand up for
him.''
   Students were to wear armbands with Anderson's name and sign a
huge birthday card that will be forwarded to Lebanon, DeWald said.
   A birthday card also was signed by Anderson's colleagues at the
AP and other journalists in New York City.

<HEAD>Smog Gas Shows Potential For Treating AIDS, Boosting Blood Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists seeking AIDS treatments and ways to
make donated blood even safer say their studies suggest an unusual
potential weapon: ozone, the main gas in smog.
   ``I'm engaged in preliminary studies on the use of ozone in the
treatment of AIDS, AIDS-related complex and intractable diarrhea''
often suffered by patients with the deadly disease, said Dr. Michael
Carpendale, of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San
Francisco.
   In a pilot study, five AIDS and AIDS-related complex patients
were given ozone rectally through a tube, said Carpendale, the
hospital's chief of rehabilitative medicine.
   The treatment halted severe diarrhea in four of the patients,
possibly by hindering the AIDS virus, he said Wednesday.
   Wagner and Dr. Kenneth Wagner, who conducted another ozone study,
said they want to study whether the worsening of AIDS in patients
might be slowed if some of their blood is removed, treated with
ozone and replaced, or if they are given the gas rectally so it is
absorbed quickly into their blood.
   The other study found ozone stopped the AIDS virus from
multiplying in donated blood while leaving more than 90 percent of
blood cells undamaged, said Wagner, until recently head of the AIDS
unit and infectious disease division at the Naval Hospital in
Bethesda, Md.
   The findings raise the possibility that ozone, often used to
disinfect water and sewage, might be applied to further reduce the
risk that donated blood could carry the AIDS virus, he said during
the 28th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy.
   Because blood donors are now tested, the chance of a unit of
blood carrying the virus is 1 in 50,000 to 100,000, said Dr. Steven
Kleinman, medical director of American Red Cross Blood Services for
Los Angeles and Orange counties.
   Kleinman said Wagner's study suggests but doesn't prove ozone
could kill AIDS or other viruses in blood, but ``it's reasonable to
try it out'' with more studies because ``we would like to make the
risk much smaller.''
   The use of ozone to sterilize donated blood or treat AIDS
patients would have to be proved safe for humans, said Dr. Mark
Rarick, a blood and cancer specialist and AIDS researcher at the
University of Southern California.
   Medical uses of ozone have been limited largely to
unsubstantiated treatments for various diseases by European holistic
medicine practitioners.
   Rarick and Kleinman said more studies must be done to determine
if ozone not only stops the AIDS virus from multiplying in blood,
but actually prevents virus components hiding in blood cells from
infecting other cells.
   Rarick also questioned whether treating AIDS patients with ozone
would destroy virus particles hiding in body tissues, something
necessary to reduce symptoms. Carpendale said he plans to study that
question.
   Nevertheless, the ``preliminary results warrant further
investigation,'' Rarick said.
   Wagner is now a senior researcher at the Henry M. Jackson
Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, but conducted
his study with colleagues at the Naval Hospital before he retired
from the Navy on Oct. 1.
   Carpendale's study hasn't been published, but he is seeking
approval to treat 20 more AIDS patients with ozone.
   The use of ozone against AIDS may make many scientists ``roll
their eyeballs,'' Wagner said. ``But when you have a very bad
disease like this with no cure, you have to have an open mind.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Participates In Boat People Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in a decade, Vietnam
participated today in multilateral discussions on the problems
caused by Vietnamese fleeing by boat to the shores of Southeast
Asian nations.
   Vietnam's communist ally Laos also took part in the meeting with
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Hong Kong,
which bear the brunt of the exodus, and with Western countries that
resettle the boat people.
   ASEAN groups Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, the
Philippines, and Brunei.
   The two days of informal discussions in Thailand are organized by
the United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees, which is also
participating.
   It was the first time since a 1979 international refugee
conference that Vietnam has participated in talks on a comprehensive
strategy for alleviating the problem. Aid officials say there is a
good possibility of another international conference early next year.
   Some Southeast Asian countries adopted tough policies, even
pushbacks, against Vietnamese boat people after they surged into the
region in 1987 in the highest level in years.
   Vietnam, eager to mend frayed relations with its non-communist
neighbors, agreed this year to cooperate in finding a solution and
has separately held talks with Hong Kong and Malaysia on a possible
program to repatriate some of the Vietnamese.
   A repatriation agreement recently was reached with Hong Kong.
   A total of 28,116 Vietnamese boat people fled to neighboring
countries in 1987, the highest annual figure since 43,676 fled in
1982, according to UNHCR figures. The highest number, 11,195,
arrived in Thailand, nearly triple the 1986 figure.

<HEAD>Japanese Woman Is Lone Passenger On British Airways Jumbo Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young Japanese woman had the trip of a lifetime
on a flight from Tokyo to London _ a choice of 353 seats, six
movies, a gourmet menu and the exclusive attention of 15 cabin
attendants.
   British Airways said today that the woman, identified only as
Mrs. Yamamoto, was the lone passenger on the 8,000-mile Flight 008,
which arrived at Heathrow Airport Tuesday afternoon.
   ``The jumbo was delayed going into Tokyo and by the time it set
off for London all the other passengers had been re-booked on to
other flights,'' said a British Airways spokesman, who by custom was
not identified.
   ``Mrs. Yamamoto had actually arrived early at the airport for
another British Airways flight which was leaving later. But since
she was there, she was offered the opportunity for the flight of a
lifetime,'' the spokesman said.
   ``We had to come back empty because the jumbo was due back in
Britain to get back into its schedule.''
   Mrs. Yamamoto, on her way to join her husband, who is studying at
Salford College of Music, had paid the standard $2,975 economy fare
for the 11-hour trip. But she sat in business class, dined on
poached salmon and watched Goldie Hawn in ``Overboard.''
   The Daily Express estimated the flight cost at least $22,750 _
$17,500 for fuel and $5,250 in wages for the cabin attendants and
six flight deck crew.
   ``We're certainly not aware of it ever happening before and I'm
sure Mrs. Yamamoto saw British Airways in-flight service at its
best,'' the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Murder Charge Against Hedda Nussbaum Dropped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman no longer faces a murder charge in the
beating death of the 6-year-old girl she and her live-in lover
illegally adopted, but her attorney says she never will forgive
herself for what happened.
   At the request of prosecutors, a judge dropped murder charges
Wednesday against Hedda Nussbaum, who is expected to testify that
her live-in companion, Joel Steinberg, killed Lisa Steinberg, whom
they obtained as a newborn from an unwed teen-age mother.
   Steinberg's murder trial was to resume today. Ms. Nussbaum is
expected to be the star witness against him.
   Assistant District Attorney John McCusker, in requesting that
murder charges against Ms. Nussbaum be dropped, said she was ``so
physically and mentally incapacitated on the night of the murder
that she was not criminally responsible for Lisa's death.''
Manhattan Criminal Court Judge John Stackhouse granted the motion.
   After the short hearing, which Ms. Nussbaum attended, Barry
Scheck, her lawyer, told reporters, ``The law had to excuse her, but
she hasn't excused herself. She never will.''
   Scheck also said the former children's book editor ``would do
anything to bring the child back.'' He praised the district
attorney's decision not to prosecute her, saying it came ``after an
unbelievably thorough and complicated investigation.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, and Steinberg, 47, had been charged with
second-degree murder in the death of Lisa last November. Steinberg
was indicted by a grand jury on the charge; Ms. Nussbaum was not.
   She has undergone surgery and extensive psychiatric treatment in
the past year for physical and emotional injuries that her lawyer
has said were inflicted by Steinberg.
   Steinberg's lawyer, Ira London, said of the dismissal of the
charge, ``I think it gives her an additional motive not to tell the
truth. It certainly is an incentive to tell the district attorney
what he wants to hear. But her credibility is a matter still for the
jury to decide.''
   During opening remarks at the trial Tuesday, London called Ms.
Nussbaum ``delusional'' and told jurors they would learn of her
``self-destructive romance with satanic cults (and) her
sadomasochistic behavior outside the home.''
   Scheck on Wednesday said the implication of London's remarks was
that Ms. Nussbaum's injuries were inflicted by someone other than
Steinberg.
   ``That suggestion is absurd,'' he said.
   Lisa was found unconscious in the couple's squalid Greenwich
Village apartment Nov. 2 and died three days later. Her death drew
national attention and made her a symbol of the plight of abused
children.
   A 16-month-old boy, Mitchell, was found in the apartment sitting
in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen, authorities said. He
also was illegally adopted, and now lives with his biological mother.

   Radical students burned an effigy of
Uncle Sam today and pelted riot police with hundreds of firebombs
and rocks as anti-U.S. and anti-government protests continued on
campuses.
   ``Drive out the Yankees,'' they shouted.
   Dozens of police were hit with rocks and burned by exploding
firebombs in violent protests at two university campuses in Seoul _
Konkuk and Dongkuk.
   The demonstrations were confined to the streets in front of the
campuses.
   Earlier today, about 20 students shouting ``Yankee go home''
attacked the Koram Bank, a Korea-U.S. joint venture bank in southern
Seoul, with firebombs and rocks. Police said two students were
arrested. No damage was reported.
   At Seoul National University, about 300 students demonstrated
peacefully, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers and nuclear
weapons they claim the American military keeps in South Korea.
   Students also urged the U.S. government to repeal its agreement
with South Korea that allows the U.S. military jurisdiction over
military personnel and their dependents involved in criminal
proceedings.
   On two campuses in Kwangju and Taegu, south of Seoul, police said
hundreds of students hurled firebombs and stones and police fired
tear gas to block them from marching off their campuses after
anti-government, anti-U.S. rallies.
   It was not immediately known if anyone was injured or arrested.
   Anti-U.S. protests have been on the rise in recent weeks, fanned
by radical students demanding the withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S.
troops stationed here under a mutual defense pact.
   On Wednesday, radicals attacked a U.S. cultural center in Taegu,
damaging three cars in the center in the third assault on U.S.
facilities in two weeks.
   U.S. military authorities confirmed today that tight security
measures adopted at U.S. installations during the Olympic Games
would continue due to ``continued unsettled conditions.''
   Bill Fullerton, a U.S. Army spokesman, said the military would
continue procedures such as tightened identification checks and
security monitoring.
   He said an advisory aimed at military personnel and their
families was issued through the American Forces Korea Network and
the newspaper Pacific Stars and Stripes.
   The advisory cautioned U.S. troops to ``be mindful of their
personal conduct while off U.S. installations'' and not to interfere
in South Korean political affairs.
   The release also said local commanders may further increase
security around their installations to avoid potential problems
related to ``continued unsettled conditions.''
   South Korean police also have stepped up security around U.S.
legations with more contingents of police patrols in response to
firebomb attacks by radical students.

   The president of a paper supply company being
investigated in the Pentagon fraud and bribery probe told employees
to throw out documents that prosecutors say contained incriminating
evidence, court papers show.
   Federal agents seized the documents later that day, June 21, from
trash containers at the Kane Paper Co. on Long Island, according to
the search warrant application, which along with other court papers
was first made public Wednesday.
   The papers, released by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman in
response to a newspaper request, show that James Kane, the firm's
founder, called his company three times to talk with employees about
throwing out business papers.
   Kane's conversations were intercepted by FBI agents who had been
secretly monitoring phone conversations at Kane Paper, which
supplies paper products to aerospace companies.
   Kane is also the president of the Long Island Aerospace Political
Action Committee and has been described by officials as an associate
of Charles Gardner, a private consultant and a former vice president
of the Unisys Corp. whose home has also been searched.
   Unisys is one of the nation's largest computer manufacturers and
a major military contractor. Search warrants were served at the
company's Eagen, Minn., and Great Neck plants.
   A secretary at Kane Paper said Kane was out of town Wednesday and
unavailable for comment. A message left with Kane's attorney,
Vincent Fuller in Washington, was not immediately returned.
   Authorities have said agents deliberately had not gone to Kane's
plant on June 14 when they staged the first nationwide series of
raids involving the defense contracting scandal because they wanted
to continue monitoring the wiretaps.
   On June 21, Kane called in the morning and spoke to an employee
identified as Thomasa Avellina, according to court testimony by FBI
agent Dan Melore.
   ``Kane says to Avellina, `I think what you should do quietly is
go through anything that might be around, that you want to get rid
of, OK?''' Melore said. ``Avellina says, `To throw them out?'''
Melore said. ``Kane: `No. Yeah.''' Avellina answers, `OK,''' Melore
said.
   Kane again called Avellina in mid-morning and asked him, ``Did
you get rid of the (blank) did you get rid of most of yours,''
Melore said. ``Avellina: yeah.''
   Kane called a third time around noon and spoke with another
employee, Daniel Carroll, to ask if Avellina had thrown out the
documents, Melore said.
   Under questioning by Korman, Melore said agents at the plant had
seen business documents in at least one trash container. Those
documents were later seized.
   ``That's the circumstances which leads us to believe that at this
point they were attempting to destroy incriminating documents,''
Melore said.
   Court documents made public earlier indicated that investigators
were seeking information at Kane Paper about the possible extortion
of campaign contributions from companies by private consultants and
others.
   Korman also questioned Melore about Kane's relationship with
Gardner.
   ``I know when we did the wiretap, you persuaded me that Kane was
engaging in conversations with Gardner that would relate and could
relate to the Unisys matter in which Gardner was involved,'' Korman
said. ``But with respect to documents that are at Kane's place of
business, that's another story. Kane wasn't involved in defrauding
Unisys.''

<HEAD>High Number Of Leukemia Deaths Reported Near Savannah River Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Nuclear Safety</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal study of workers at the Savannah
River nuclear plant found twice the usual rate of deaths from
leukemia.
   The finding by the Oak Ridge Associated Universities Center for
Epidemiologic Research is consistent with the results of a study by
the Du Pont Co. released in 1976, plant officials said in a
statement Wednesday. Du Pont runs the federal plant under contract.
   The Oak Ridge study included 1,274 male hourly workers who were
hired before 1955 and worked five to 15 years. Overall, they had
fewer than expected deaths from all causes, but six leukemia deaths,
a greater number than would be expected.
   ``The finding of an increase in the number of leukemia deaths in
this population warrants further investigation. We are conducting a
study in which a full assessment will be made of radiation and
chemical exposure,'' said Donna L. Cragle, head of a team of
researchers at the Oak Ridge center.
   Cragle said in a statement released by the plant that further
studies are under way to determine if the leukemia deaths are in any
way related to the workers' exposure to radiation or chemicals on
the job.
   Radiation monitoring data for the men who died of leukemia showed
that all were exposed to less than the current annual occupational
radiation limit.
   The researchers' findings were reported this month in the
American Journal of Industrial Medicine. They have been presented to
plant employees and managers.
   Oak Ridge Associated Universities is a private, non-profit
association of 49 colleges and universities based in Tennessee that
is a management and operating contractor for the Department of
Energy.
   In a related development, a national group of 60,000 physicians
and medical students called Wednesday for the creation of a national
medical board to assess public and environmental health problems
associated with the operation of the Savannah River plant and other
U.S. nuclear weapons plants.
   Physicians for Social Responsibility said production of nuclear
weapons should not be resumed at Savannah River until public health
questions related to the plant's operation are resolved.
   And 28 members of the House Armed Services Committee called
Wednesday for the Department of Energy to prove that the plant's
reactors are safe before they are restarted.
   In separate but similar letters to President Reagan and Energy
Secretary John Herrington, the bi-partisan coalition also urged the
department to ask for enough money to correct mounting technical and
environmental problems at the facility, near Aiken, and at other
nuclear weapons production facilities.
   The letters, written by Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., and signed by
about 27 others, place blame for the deteriorating complex on the
department.
   They say the result is that the nation is ``unable to produce
nuclear materials needed to maintain the deterrent value of our
nuclear weapons.''
   Unlike a similar letter signed last week by 12 congressmen, the
Spratt letters do not criticize Du Pont or any other contractors
that operate DOE's weapons facilities.
   ``The crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period, and
it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance, safety and
operating conditions,'' said the letter to Herrington.
   Among the demands in the letter to Reagan is the appointment of a
five-member safety panel approved by Congress during the summer. The
panel would represent another check on the Energy Department's
operations.
   Herrington announced Oct. 11 that the department plans to restart
one of the Savannah River reactors by Dec. 31. Except for an
abortive attempt to restart another reactor in August, all of the
plant's reactors have been shut since April due to safety concerns.

<HEAD>Hollywood Teamsters Strike Settlement Goes To Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Hollywood Teamsters were scheduled to
vote on a tentative settlement with producers that a union leader
expressed little enthusiasm over but predicted will be ratified to
end the 24-day-old walkout.
   ``There's no winner,'' Earl Bush, secretary-treasurer of
Teamsters Local 399, said Wednesday in announcing the tentative
pact. ``It's time to go back to work and get the industry back on
its feet.''
   The Teamsters, on strike since Oct. 3, were scheduled to vote on
the three-year contract this afternoon. If approved, the 2,100
studio drivers represented by the local could return to work at the
beginning of next week.
   Results of the balloting were expected late tonight or Friday,
officials said.
   It also was disclosed Wednesday that 600 members of the Laborers
Union settled their strike with the producers and will return to
work Monday.
   And representatives of about 100 striking studio electricians
were reported to have concluded their negotiations with the
producers late Wednesday and also are supposed to vote today on
their pact.
   At a news conference to announce the settlement, Bush showed
obvious displeasure over the agreement in the Teamsters strike and
refused to say whether he would recommend it to union members.
   ``I can recommend that it's time to end the strike or a
lockout,'' Bush said. ``That's a lot different than recommending
that this package is good or recommending to the members that they
should be accepting on the terms of the package.''
   Neither Bush nor Nicholas Counter III, president of the Alliance
of Motion Picture and Television Producers, would give details of
the pact. But a source told the Los Angeles Times that union lost on
a major issue in the strike, new rules for overtime.
   Under the new contract, a driver will only be paid overtime on
Saturday or Sunday if working on those days means putting in more
than 40 hours a week, the source told The Times. Previously, drivers
were paid overtime for all weekend work.
   The agreement also would give most drivers 45-cent-an-hour wage
increases for each of the next three years, the newspaper reported.
The basic driver's wage under the current contract is $16.61 an hour.
   The studios have used replacement drivers during the strike, but
the Teamsters are expected to get their jobs back, the Times said.

   Vilma Bande was frightened as giant
waves rocked the passenger ship Dona Marilyn, but the crew urged her
to remain calm and take off her life jacket.
   Moments later, she was adrift in stormy seas and the vessel was
gone.
   The 19-year-old nurse, en route to visit her parents in Tacloban,
was among up to 500 passengers bound for Tacloban from Manila aboard
the ship when it sank Monday during the height of Typhoon Ruby.
   She and more than 100 other survivors _ dazed and sullen after
their ordeal _ arrived today in this city 350 miles southeast of
Manila. The survivors included at least six children, one a
4-year-old girl.
   Asked what happened to her parents, the girl sighed: ``They're
gone.''
   Survivors appeared bruised and shaken. Several told of struggling
for three or more hours in violent seas before washing ashore on
small islands near where the vessel sank.
   Few survivors smiled or waved as they walked from the ship that
brought them to Tacloban. Some still clutched the life jackets that
had saved them.
   In Manila, the coast guard said some survivors remained today on
small islands _ too shaken to agree to board rescue vessels.
Officials said several were in shock.
   Miss Bande said that as giant waves battered the 2,855-ton Dona
Marilyn on Monday, she and hundreds of others anxiously waited on
deck as the crew frantically tried to pump water from the ship.
   ``There was no announcement. The crew members were shouting
`don't panic, remove your life jackets, relax, this is normal,'''
she said. But few passengers, if any, heeded the advice.
   Suddenly, she recalled, a giant wave ``as tall as a building''
crashed over the deck and the vessel rolled to the side.
   ``I jumped and in less than one minute, I turned my back and the
ship was gone,'' she said.
   Lea Hugo, 29, donned a life jacket and leaped into the raging sea
although she did not know how to swim.
   ``I was struggling in the water,'' she said. ``I saw a piece of
wood and clung to it. The next thing I knew, somebody grabbed me and
helped me to shore.''
   Miss Hugo washed ashore on Almagro island, about 20 miles from
where officials believe the Dona Marilyn sank.
   She said some island fishermen braved the raging seas and set out
in small boats to rescue passengers. Other survivors washed up on
the beaches, barely strong enough to walk.
   The ordeal has left Miss Hugo, a nurse, temporarily blinded.
Still, she is thankful to be alive.
   ``I am looking at you but I can only see your silhouette,'' she
said as tears streamed down her bruised face. ``I guess I'm just
lucky.''

<HEAD>Explorer Hopes To Recover Boston Tea Party Chests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An undersea explorer who found a wrecked pirate
ship four years ago believes he can locate the site of the Boston
Tea Party and hopes to recover some of the 342 chests dumped into
Boston Harbor in 1773.
   Barry Clifford said he will ask the state Board of Underwater
Archaeological Resources for a permit to survey what he believes is
the Tea Party site and thesites of other harbor shipwrecks dating
back to 1612.
   ``We have very high hopes of finding these chests in very good
condition,'' Clifford said. ``We have every reason to believe that
they would be in a fairly close radius to the original site and
obviously buried in the mud.''
   Clifford, the 43-year-old president of Maritime Explorations Inc.
in Chatham, said he and his assistants have surveyed the harbor with
electronic image-gathering equipment for 18 months in an effort to
pinpoint the location.
   He declined to say where he believes the Tea Party occurred,
fearing the site might be raided, but he said it is in Fort Point
Channel, not far from where the Beaver, a replica of one of the Tea
Party ships, is docked.
   While some of the chests probably floated away, many should be in
the area under four to 10 feet of mud, Clifford said.
   The chests are believed to be 16 inches long, 12 inches wide, and
12 inches high and covered with lacquer and enamel.
   ``Chinese lacquer is impervious to water, and with the mud acting
as a refrigerator, our chemists feel there's a good chance that some
of these chests will be in good condition.'' Clifford said.
   Robert Cahill, described as an expert on New England shipwrecks,
told the Boston Herald each chest could be worth as much as $1
million depending on its interest as an historical artifact.
   The Tea Party was a protest against the three-penny tax King
George III imposed on American colonists for a pound of tea.
   On Dec. 16, 1773, 30 patriots, dressed as American Indians,
raided three ships in Boston Harbor, hauling crates containing tea
chests to the decks, opening the chests and throwing them into the
ocean.
   In 1984, Clifford located the 18th century pirate ship Whydah off
Wellfleet on Cape Cod. He said he has excavated less than 4 percent
of the treasure, estimated at millions of dollars, that was on that
ship.

   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 14
Palestinians during stone-throwing clashes in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip today, Arab reports and hospital officials said.
   A fundamentalist Moslem group called for more general strikes
against Israeli occupation. ``Let's burn the land under the
occupiers,'' said a leaflet distributed by the Hamas, or Zeal,
movement.
   The PLO-backed underground leadership of the Palestinian uprising
also issued a new leaflet, addressed to the Israeli people,
appealing for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied lands and
establishment of a Palestinian state.
   Clashes with soldiers were reported in at least four cities and
towns in the West Bank and Gaza. The army said it was checking
reports of 14 Palestinians wounded.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, Palestinian youths threw
stones and bottles at soldiers at a protest called by underground
leaders against Israel's demand for new license plates on West Bank
cars, Arab reporters said.
   Soldiers responded with tear gas and live ammunition, wounding
six Palestinians ranging in age from 14 to 24, said officials at
Al-Ittihad and St. John's hospitals.
   The protest involved hundreds of cars and trucks blocking roads
in response to an appeal over loudspeakers to stop vehicles wherever
they were at 9 a.m. The move was to protest a plan to require
license plates that show exactly where the car is registered and
cost owners $250.
   A 17-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy were wounded in the West
Bank village of Idna, according to hospital officials who said
soldiers shot when residents tried to block an army unit from
entering the village near Hebron.
   In the Gaza Strip, six Palestinians were reported shot with
plastic bullets after a stone-throwing melee began on Palestine
Street in Gaza City and youths set ablaze tires in the Khan Yunis
refugee camp.
   One of the wounded in Khan Yunis was a 41-year-old woman shot in
the chest with a plastic bullet, hospital officials said.
   Three schools in Gaza City were ordered closed by the army today
to halt violence, Arab reports said. They said three other schools
were shut down by soldiers Wednesday in Khan Yunis.
   In violence Wednesday, a 3-year-old Palestinian girl died in the
Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, and her family claimed the death was
caused by tear gas inhalation, the army said. Arab sources said 10
Palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers during scattered
clashes with soldiers.
   At least 303 Palestinians have been killed, along with six
Israelis, since the uprising against Israeli occupation began last
Dec. 8.
   The new Hamas leaflet urged Palestinians to stage four general
strikes against Israeli rule in the next three weeks.

   Bright yellow handbills offering free food for
the homeless turned out to be bogus after dozens of people showed up
looking for dinner at a downtown restaurant.
   ``I'm really outraged,'' said Lymon Lindstrom, a homeless person
who waited outside the Kansas City Barbeque restaurant for several
hours Wednesday before finding out the offer was a hoax.
   The sponsor was listed as the San Diego Active 20+30 Club, a
charitable organization with about 30 members which was having a
meeting inside the restaurant at the time the handbills said the
free dinners would be served.
   ``Someone is playing a joke. That's all I know,'' said club
president George Kvaas, whose phone number was on the handbills.
   Cindy Blair, one of the restaurant owners, said limited supplies
made it impossible to provide food for those attracted by the
handbills. An apology sign was placed in a window.
   Steve Sapper, a former club president whom the handbills credited
with donating their printing cost, called the incident ``a cruel
hoax'' by unknown individuals.
   ``We don't understand any of this. We've done a lot of good
things for the community,'' said Sapper, noting that helping
underprivileged children has been a primary focus for the group.

been donated to the University of Miami library, his widow says.
   Marilyn Gleason says her husband, who died last year, was a
voracious reader who sometimes read a book a day.
   The books reveal that the ``Great One'' had eclectic interests,
including a penchant for the occult and the supernatural.
   Many of the books that piled up at his Lauderhill home dealt with
UFOs, witchcraft and parapsychology. Gleason's reading material also
included autographed road-to-fame autobiographies by fellow

billards.
   The complete Jackie Gleason library will be housed in the

   Developer Donald Trump has sent Mike Tyson a
warning letter after learning that the world heavyweight boxing
champion has yet to send his $2 million fee to charity, according to
a report published today.
   Trump and Tyson agreed on the donation to charity in lieu of a
retainer fee when the billionaire developer several months back took
on the role of ``financial adviser'' to Tyson.
   In today's editions, New York Newsday quoted unidentified sources
in the Trump organization as saying that Trump sent the letter after
learning that Tyson had not sent the payment. It called for Tyson to
send the fee to a foundation set up in Tyson's name, which would
then distribute the money to undisclosed charities.
   In his letter, Trump suggested that if Tyson chose not to send
the money to charity, then he owed it to the developer, who would
then send it to charity, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said today Americans
should vote for Republican George Bush ``as an act of self-defense''
because Democratic rival Michael Dukakis favors gun controls, and to
say ``no'' to higher taxes.
   Playing to the conservative values of his audience of GOP
partisans at a Little Rock airport rally, the president portrayed
Dukakis as a far-out liberal who would raise taxes and threaten the
nation's defenses _ but is trying to disguise his real goals from
the voters.
   ``I have to say, how can a man running for president of the
United States look the American people in the eye and tell you that
his ideology doesn't matter?'' Reagan asked in a prepared speech.
   In one of his hardest-hitting speeches yet as Bush's chief
surrogate on the campaign trail, Reagan suggested that the
Massachusetts governor has used his newly toughened attacks on the
GOP nominee to hide his own liberal record.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, if he is saying to you that what he
believes doesn't matter, isn't he really saying that what each one
of us believes doesn't matter?'' Reagan asked.
   Embarking on a week-long, cross-country tour, Reagan was
traveling from Arkansas to Missouri and California to tout his vice
president as crime-busting yet compassionate man who deserves to
inherit the White House Oval Office.
   ``On Nov. 8th, go into that polling booth and do some negative
campaigning of your own, the right kind of negative campaigning: Say
`no' to new taxes and `yes' to the Republican ticket,'' the
president told his audience.
   He charged that Dukakis would allow only ``the military and
police'' to carry guns, and said voters should cast their ballots
for Bush and his running mate, Dan Quayle, ``as an act of
self-defense.''
   Dukakis says he wants to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,
but favors their ownership by hunters, sportsmen and homeowners who
want to protect their lives and property.
   Throughout his speech, Reagan boasted of what ``George and I''
had achieved. ``For eight years, George Bush and I have worked
side-by-side in the White House, during times of crisis and times of
historic triumph and achievements,'' he said.
   For example, the president said, ``You know, violent crime has
fallen significantly since 1981 because George and I put criminals
on notice.''
   The president claimed that under Bush's leadership, a federal
task force had slashed 600 million man-hours of paperwork a year
from the government's workload, spearheaded the administration's
anti-drug offensive and paved the way toward the U.S.-Soviet treaty
banning medium-range nuclear missiles.
   Reagan praised Bush as ``strong, decent loyal, wise, capable and
compassionate _ a man who has the qualities necessary to fill the
office of president.''
   He added: ``As for a certain governor from a certain New England
state, I'd best let someone else do the talking. Former Arkansas
Congressman Ed Bethune said he'd met this fellow 10 years ago and
his reaction was, let me quote him now, `I have never met a person
in my whole life who is more liberal'.''
   Reagan, obviously buoyed by recent polls showing Bush widening
his lead over the Democratic nominee, said, ``I have little doubt
that the people of the United States are going to do exactly what I
did eight years ago: They are going to choose George Bush.''
   At a GOP fund-raising luncheon Wednesday in Baltimore, the
president said Bush has Democrats ``squirming'' and ``squealing''
because he's shown them to be what ``they really are,'' as liberals
who stand outside the mainstream of American values.
   In light of Bush's double-digit leads in the polls, Reagan also
will spend some time next week boosting local GOP candidates in
several cities in southern California, as well as Nevada and
Wisconsin.
   Amid his hectic schedule of cross-country campaigning, Reagan has
sandwiched in a weekend respite at his Santa Barbara ranch with his
wife, Nancy.
   Since Labor Day, Reagan has made 21 political appearances in 13
states and has raised about $8.8 million for the national and state
Republican campaign coffers.

<HEAD>Second Canadian Back in Running for PTL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second Canadian businessman is back in
the bidding for the assets of PTL, the financially troubled ministry
of deposed television evangelist Jim Bakker.
   Real estate magnate Peter Thomas of Vancouver asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds to consider his proposal along with
that of Stephen Mernick of Toronto.
   Four of PTL's largest creditors joined in Thomas' motion, which
was filed Wednesday in federal bankruptcy court. Attorneys for two
creditors said they weren't endorsing Thomas's $113 million offer
over Mernick's $115 million bid, but that they want Reynolds to have
a choice from at least two competing bids.
   Reynolds is scheduled to rule on Thomas' motion Nov. 16, which is
the same day he has set to consider a motion approving a sale to
Mernick.
   PTL, which has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987,
must sell its assets to pay debts that could amount to more than
$130 million.
   PTL's holdings include the 500-acre Heritage USA theme park,
1,700 acres of undeveloped land and the PTL satellite TV network.
   Mernick had apparently won the bidding Oct. 4, when PTL trustee
M.C. ``Red'' Benton accepted his $115 million offer and promised not
to negotiate further with anyone else. Other bidders can go directly
to the court, but none had done so until Thomas filed his motion
Wednesday.
   In accepting Mernick's bid, Benton said he had rejected a $113
million offer by Thomas in September, because Thomas's $46 million
cash down payment would not be due until September 1989.
   Mernick's offer includes $50 million cash by Dec. 31. However,
Mernick has until Nov. 15 to back out of the deal with no penalty.
   Thomas' new offer still has a $113 million total price, but
matches Mernick's $50 million cash. Thomas would have until Feb. 28
to back out, and until June 30 to close the sale and come up with
the cash.
   Thomas announced his re-entry in the bidding at his Vancouver,
British Columbia, headquarters.
   ``We're elated,'' Thomas said. ``We didn't like being on the
sidelines. We always felt our offer was one of the best.''
   In a telephone interview with The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer,
Thomas said he thinks his offer may be more attractive to Reynolds
because he promises to maintain Heritage USA as a Christian retreat,
while Mernick, who is Jewish, makes no such pledge.
   ``I think Mernick's and my offers are so dramatically different
that it's right the judge should look at them,'' Thomas said. ``My
offer is committed to keep the ambience of the site like it is ...
and Mr. Mernick's offer is more of paving it and putting a shopping
center on it.''
   Mernick said two weeks ago that he had made no decision about
what he would do with Heritage USA, but added that the undeveloped
land would be ``excellent for condominiums, shopping centers and
commercial buildings.''

   Journalists from Argentina, Brazil, Peru and the
United States have won the 50th annual Maria Moors Cabot Prizes for
fostering understanding between the Americas, Columbia University
announced.
   The winners announced Wednesday were Nicholas Clark Asheshov,
editor of The Lima Times and The Andean Report of Lima, Peru; Robert
Civita, creator and publisher of Veja of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Stephen
Kinzer, foreign correspondent of The New York Times; and
Hermenegildo Sabat, staff cartoonist of Clarin in Buenos Aires,
Argentina.
   The awards, to be presented in ceremonies at the university this
evening, are given for distinguished contributions to inter-American
understanding and freedom of information.
   The winners receive gold medals and $1,000. Clarin and The New
York Times are previous Cabot winners and will receive silver bars
to be added to plaques the newspapers received earlier.
   The Cabot prizes, the oldest international journalism awards,
were established by Godfrey Lowell Cabot of Boston as a memorial to
his wife. Since 1939, 179 medals and 139 special citations have been
given to journalists from 30 countries.
   Asheshov is also the correspondent in Lima for The Sunday Times,
the Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph, all of London, and The Miami
Herald.
   Civita is also president of the Brazilian Magazine Publishers
Association.
   Kinzer, a former aide to Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis, has been correspondent for the Times in Nicaragua
since 1983. Sabat has been a cartoonist for Clarin since 1973.

   Smarting from one of the heaviest Israeli
air raids on their strongholds this year, Palestinians today buried
19 people killed in an air assault and ensuing ground battle near
the port city of Sidon.
   Although the Palestine Liberation Organiztaion said it planned
mass funerals for the victims, they were buried in quiet ceremonies
in Sidon's main cemetery and a Palestinian graveyard in the nearby
village of Darb el-Seem.
   There were no anti-Israeli chants or cries for revenge that had
characterized funerals for victims of previous Israeli attacks.
   ``We just couldn't risk mass gatherings,'' said a guerrilla
officer at one of the funerals. He refused to give his name. ``With
Israel's appetite for attacking at its peak, we figured it's prudent
to keep a low profile.''
   Police said rescuers using gasoline lanterns searched the rubble
of a guerrilla base of 30 buildings pulverized in the Wednesday
morning bombing of Sidon's Mieh Mieh refugee camp. They dug out nine
bodies.
   A family of six _ a man, his wife and their two sons and
daughters _ were among the bodies. The children's ages ranged
between six and 15, police said. The three other victims were
guerrillas.
   Six bodies were found immediately after the air raid on the base,
which belonged to Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser
Aarafat's mainstream Fatah guerrilla group.
   Four other Palestinian guerrillas were killed in a ground battle
that began after the raid with Israel's main proxy force, the South
Lebanon Army militia.
   The four guerrillas belonged to the radical Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, which is headed by the notorious Palestinian terrorist
mastermind, Abu Nidal.
   The Mieh Mieh air raid claimed the second heaviest casualty toll
of Israel's 18 air strikes in Lebanon this year. Twenty-six people
were killed and 30 wounded in the first air raid north of Sidon Jan.
3.
   Police and guerrilla spokesmen regarded Wednesday's assault as
the worst in terms of destruction and guerrilla casualties.
   ``Mieh Mieh has suffered the most severe destruction since
Israel's 1982 invasion'' of Lebanon, said a police spokesman in
Sidon. He cannot be named under standing regulations.
   Among those killed was Col. Mustafa Daoud, commander of the
1,000-strong Fatah militia.
   The Mieh Mieh raid was followed 4{ hours later by two bombing
runs against guerrilla bases of pro-Syrian Palestinian factions just
south of Beirut and in hills overlooking the coastal town of Damour,
midway between Beirut and Sidon. At least one guerrilla was wounded.
   The Israeli strikes followed two foiled Palestinian guerrilla
attempts to infiltrate into northern Israel from south Lebanon on
Tuesday. The attempts were uncovered by Israeli troops and the
predominantly Christian SLA militiamen who patrol Israel's
self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   Israel warplanes struck bases in Lebanon on Friday and Sunday in
retaliation for a suicide car bombing in the security zone last week
in which eight Israeli soldiers were killed and nine people wounded.
   Twenty-one people were killed and 34 wounded in the two strikes,
which were directed against Palestinian and Lebanese Shiite Moslem
bases in south and southeast Lebanon.
   The pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of God, had claimed
responsibility for the suicide bombing.

   Democrats and Republicans traded
recriminations after condemned multiple murderer John Wayne Gacy
apparently criticized the use of his name in GOP campaign leaflets
as ``disgusting and exploitive.''
   Gacy, through a spokesman for the Illinois Department of
Corrections, confirmed Wednesday that he sent a letter to GOP
officials about leaflets that say Gacy would have been ``eligible
for weekend passes'' had he committed his 33 murders in
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' home state.
   The Republican leaflets were labeled ``garbage'' earlier this
month by Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate. And GOP
presidential candidate George Bush said Saturday he disapproved of
them.
   But Judith Erwin, Illinois communications director for Dukakis'
campaign, suggested Wednesday that Republicans might have somehow
concocted Gacy's letter.
   ``It is really right up their alley, and an alley is where they
are trying to conduct the campaign,'' she said.
   ``The language in that letter is language out of a campaign
brochure. Tell me how a man on Death Row is so well informed about
the inner workings of a presidential campaign.''
   Earlier, Stuart Piper, executive director of the Illinois
Republican Party, had characterized the letter by saying, ``Here
again we have another example of a criminal who is apparently
supportive of Mike Dukakis.''
   Later, he denied any party involvement.
   ``We don't condone such campaign tactics or those remarks from
the Dukakis campaign,'' he said. ``We held this letter for two days
and it wasn't until Gacy apparently sent this letter to a news
organization that this story came about. We had nothing to do with
it and didn't feel that it merited any further public discussion due
to the source.''
   In a one-page typewritten letter received Monday at state
Republican headquarters, Gacy wrote: ``It is an insult to the voting
public that the Illinois Republican State Central Committee has to
drop to such a sleazy level by exploiting the name of John Wayne
Gacy in order to scare people into voting for George Bush.''
   A virtually identical letter, dated Oct. 23, was mailed to The
Associated Press. After a request from the AP, GOP officials
provided a copy of the letter they received.
   The letter sent to the Republicans called the campaign literature
``disgusting and exploitive'' and said, ``Can't Bush run on his own
record and the truth, instead of all this scarey (sic) fantasy?''
   The state GOP mailings refer to a furlough program for prisoners
carried on under Dukakis' administration and to a convicted killer,
Willie Horton, who brutalized a Maryland couple while on furlough
from a Massachusetts prison.
   ``If John Wayne Gacy had committed his atrocious crimes in Boston
instead of Chicago, he would be eligible for weekend passes under
Michael Dukakis' furlough program,'' the leaflets said.
   Gacy was convicted in 1980 in the killings of 33 young men and
boys, 29 of whom were found buried in his home near Chicago.
   He was sentenced to death and is imprisoned at the Menard
Correctional Center in southern Illinois, but appeals are pending.

<HEAD>Child Allegedly Beaten To Death At Father's Commune Is Buried</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old girl who was allegedly beaten to
death by members of a commune founded by her father was mourned by
about 150 people, including her uncle, who said he hoped others
could learn from the tragedy.
   Dayna Lorea Broussard's uncle, Henry Webb, was the only speaker
at the funeral Wednesday at the Angelus Crenshaw Chapel to refer
directly to the circumstances surrounding the girl's death.
   ``This is an experience that we've never experienced before,''
Webb told the mourners, as Dayna's body lay in a pink embossed
casket. ``Through this experience may we learn to love one another
better and to experience life more.''
   The girl's parents did not attend the service.
   Dayna, who would have turned 9 on Monday, died Oct. 14 allegedly
from beatings and whippings administered by members of the Ecclesia
Athletic Association, a group formed to help inner-city children.
   The girl's parents stayed away from the funeral because of the
media attention it has attracted, said the child's maternal
grandmother, Viola Grant, who arranged the service.
   Dayna's father, Eldridge Broussard Jr., a former college
basketball star in Oregon, organized the athletic commune in Sandy,
Ore., as a training center and an extension of the Watts Christian
Center, founded by his father.
   Authorities in Clackamas County, Ore., have alleged that the
children found at a home there were forced to watch as adults, using
paddles or electrical cords, administered ritualistic beatings to
children.
   Broussard was in Los Angeles at the time of his daughter's death
but has since returned to Sandy.
   Broussard has maintained that Ecclesia no longer exists,
sabotaged by biased news media portrayals that likened his group to
a cult. He also has blamed the media for his daughter's death.
   Four people have been charged with first-degree manslaughter in
the Ecclesia case, and the Oregon Children's Services Division has
taken more than 50 children into protective custody.
   The four people charged in the girl's death have pleaded innocent.
   Meanwhile, a misdemeanor complaint alleging child endangerment
and inflicting illegal corporal punishment was filed Wednesday in
Los Angeles against Alvin Elvis Broussard, the 25-year-old brother
of Eldridge.
   The complaint stemmed from a police visit to the Watts Christian
Center on Oct. 16 that was prompted by news reports of Dayna's death
in Oregon, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for City Attorney James
Hahn.
   Officers at the center found a 10-year-old boy with bruises who
said he had been struck by Alvin Broussard, Hahn said in a statement.

   A young Japanese woman had the trip of a lifetime
on a flight from Tokyo to London _ a choice of 353 seats, six
movies, a gourmet menu and the exclusive attention of 15 cabin
attendants.
   British Airways said today that the woman, identified only as
Mrs. Yamamoto, was the lone passenger on the 8,000-mile Flight 008
of the Boeing 747, which arrived at Heathrow Airport Tuesday
afternoon.
   ``The jumbo was delayed going into Tokyo and by the time it set
off for London all the other passengers had been re-booked on to
other flights,'' said a British Airways spokesman, who by custom was
not identified.
   ``Mrs. Yamamoto had actually arrived early at the airport for
another British Airways flight which was leaving later. But since
she was there, she was offered the opportunity for the flight of a
lifetime,'' the spokesman said.
   ``We had to come back empty because the jumbo was due back in
Britain to get back into its schedule.''
   Mrs. Yamamoto, on her way to join her husband, who is studying at
Salford College of Music, had paid the standard $2,975 economy fare
for the 11-hour trip. But she sat in business class, dined on
poached salmon and watched Goldie Hawn in ``Overboard.''
   The Daily Express estimated the flight cost at least $22,750 _
$17,500 for fuel and $5,250 in wages for the cabin attendants and
six flight deck crew.
   ``We're certainly not aware of it ever happening before and I'm
sure Mrs. Yamamoto saw British Airways in-flight service at its
best,'' the spokesman said.
   In Geneva, Thomas Pyle, spokesman for the International Air
Transport Association, said: ``It's the first time we have heard of
something like this. It must be extremely rare, if not the only
occasion. She certainly got a good deal.''

   Personal trips taken by Secretary of State
George Shultz on his military aircraft over a 30-month period cost
the government nearly $1.9 million, with Shultz paying only the
price of economy-class airfare, a congressional report says.
   The General Accounting Office report says Shultz took 23 personal
trips during the 30 months ended last July, most of them visits to
family homes at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., and
Cummington, Mass. Most of the time Shultz was accompanied only by
his wife, Helena.
   The total bill for those trips came to $1,892,214, GAO told the
House Government Operations Committee in a report released
Wednesday. Most of the money was spent for Shultz' military plane,
its sophisticated communications equipment and the secretary's
security personnel, the review said.
   Shultz reimbursed the government for less than 1 percent of the
cost, basing his repayment rate on the economy air fare rate to a
destination plus $1, State Department officials told the GAO.
   The total amount Shultz reimbursed the government was $18,783,
the GAO said.
   Shultz' annual Cabinet salary is $99,030. His net worth is
unavailable, but his financial disclosure form filed earlier this
year shows that a blind trust created from his holdings had income
last year in excess of $100,000.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Shultz used the
military plane because ``the secretary of state is the secretary of
state 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,'' no matter where he is.
   Redman said Shultz has followed the practice used by other
secretaries of state for the past 15 or 20 years. Many other Cabinet
members also use military aircraft for reasons of improved security
and communications, he said.
   Redman added, ``The fact of the matter is that the security
threat doesn't disappear just because the secretary happens to be on
vacation, nor does the need for communications.''
   The bulk of the $1.89 million cost for the 23 trips went for
military aircraft _ $797,219, the GAO said. Hotel accommodations for
security personnel and other aides cost $336,414; overtime for those
personnel cost $256,205; per diem food costs were $183,030; and
$141,464 was spent to install telephone lines.
   In addition to the 23 personal trips, the study listed a series
of other trips by Shultz between 1982 and 1986 that were listed as
official travel, but which also included a private component. Those
trips weren't among the 23 whose expenses were totaled by the GAO.

   President Reagan said today the United States
has ``no choice'' but to tear down the nearly complete U.S. Embassy
in Moscow because the facility is riddled with eavesdropping devices.
   Reagan, walking toward his helicopter to begin a campaign trip to
Arkansas, Missouri and California, was asked if he had decided the
embassy must be demolished.
   ``Yes,'' he replied, ``because there's no way to rid it of the
many listening devices that were built into it.''
   ``We have to do it. We have no choice,'' Reagan said. Asked where
the money would be found for a replacement, he replied, ``We'll take
it away from something else.''
   ``We're going to start and have an American-built one,'' he said
of the embassy.
   The Washington Post reported today that Reagan will recommend to
Congress that the embassy be razed and rebuilt, at a cost estimated
at $300 million.
   The newspaper said it could take five years to build a
replacement eight-story embassy on the same site with materials
imported from the United States.
   State Department sources have said Secretary of State George
Shultz recommended the move to Reagan after the unfinished building
was inspected by a congressional delegation and a private
engineering firm.
   The first eavesdropping bugs, in structural elements built
elsewhere by Soviet workers and transported to the site, were
discovered by U.S. inspectors in the spring of 1987.
   One member of Congress who toured the facility, Rep. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, said in September that $38 million remained in
previously approved enbassy-construction appropriations to dismantle
the unoccupied embassy.
   But Rep. Snowe said that BDM Corp., which inspected the facility
for the State Department, said the dismantling could cost $160
million. Construction of the bug-riddled embassy and studies about
its future have cost nearly $60 million.
   The Post said officials now plan to fabricate the building's main
elements in the United States, ship them to the Soviet Union, keep
them under heavy guard and have the building assembled by U.S.
workers taken to Moscow for the construction project.
   State Department officials said that until a new U.S. embassy is
occupied Soviet officials in Washington will be barred from using
their long-completed but unoccupied embassy office building.
   The United States and the Soviet Union agreed in 1972 to build
new, larger embassies in each other's capital.

September</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of imported goods dropped 1.1 percent
from July through September, the first quarterly decline in more
than two years, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department said the decline, which followed a 2.6
percent second quarter increase, reflected widespread drops in a
variety of imported goods. Only the cost of chemicals showed an
increase for the quarter, rising by 2.7 percent.
   By contrast, crude oil and other imported fuels fell by a steep
7.1 percent while the cost of imported food dropped 1.1 percent and
imported machinery prices dipped 0.5 percent.
   Without the big drop in energy prices, all imported goods still
would have registered a 0.6 percent price drop during the quarter
after a 2.4 percent rise in the previous quarter.
   It is the first drop in import prices since the first quarter of
1986, when prices fell 3.3 percent. Part of the price decline
reflected the fact that the dollar's value on foreign exchange rates
rose during the quarter.
   Even with the July through September decline, import prices are
still 4.1 percent higher than they were a year ago.
   The price of U.S. exports rose 2 percent during the third quarter
and now stands 8.7 percenting
the impact of the summer drought in the Farm Belt as grain prices
rose sharply. Food exports had risen by 8.6 percent in the second
quarter and are now 36.8 percent higher than a year ago.
   In contrast, prices of crude materials, which had been rising
rapidly, edged up just 0.6 percent in the third quarter, the
smallest increase in two years.
   The category of machinery and transport equipment, which
constitutes nearly one-half of U.S. exports, rose by 0.5 percent in
the third quarter following a 0.8 percent rise in the second quarter.

<HEAD>U.S. Customs Inspectors Claim Computer System Lets Illegal Drugs
In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs Service inspectors are protesting a computer system
that they say allows more drugs to enter the country because it
tells them how thoroughly to search, or not to search, cargo
shipments.
   Seven years ago, Customs agents say, they examined about a
quarter of all cargo imported through Miami International Airport,
but now 90 percent of the items pass through untouched under the
program that has computers target likely contraband shipments.
   ``They have created an honor system for importers,'' said Reta
Grant, president-elect of the National Treasury Employees Union in
Miami. ``Instead of being on site to inspect merchandise, we are
sitting behind computers. It's like taking a policeman off the beat
and putting him in an office and expecting him to do his job.''
   But agency administrators say that the nationwide computer system
that was the target of the protest Wednesday was responsible for
recent seizures of large amounts of cocaine and that any problems
with the system were being corrected.
   ``We know that incidents have happened and where we can make a
change or an adjustment we do that,'' said Robert Murphy, deputy
assistant regional commissioner of commercial operations for the
Customs Service in Chicago. ``If it was not for the system, there
would be a lot more incidents and shipments of drugs getting
through.''
   About 20 Customs workers picketed outside the Miami airport,
carrying signs bearing slogans such as ``Customs computer system is
a welcome mat for drug smugglers'' and ``Customs commission's
computers create chaos.''
   Federal workers also demonstrated outside the Customs Service's
regional office in Chicago, and similar demonstrations were held at
other large ports of entry.
   The Customs Service began using the computer system in 1984 and
it is now operating at all of the 300 official ports of entry in the
United States, said spokesman Ed Kittredge in Washington.
   The system targets specific cargo shipments for thorough searches
based on various criteria, including whether the shipment is a
first-time import to a particular company, whether the merchandise
comes from a drug-related country and whether people suspected by
the Customs Service handled the goods, he said.
   Anthony Hartnett, a customs inspector at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport, said the agency was relying too much on the
computers.
   ``Computers are good, but they should be a tool and not the sole
thing the agency relies on, and that's what's happened,'' said
Hartnett. ``When the computer and the inspector disagree, the final
vote should go to the inspector.''
   While inspectors technically may ignore the computer's advice,
``We've been told that when the computer said an extensive search
was not necessary we should go along with it,'' Hartnett said.
   Kittredge said the computer is only a tool. ``Any inspector is
encouraged to look at any cargo he or she suspects,'' he said.
   In at least one case, drugs were discovered by inspectors who
disregarded the computer's determination that a shipment needed only
a cursory check, said George King, a union spokesman in Chicago.
   In that incident in July, the computer said a shipment labeled
coffee that arrived at Newark International Airport in New Jersey
did not need to be checked thoroughly, he said. But the inspector
was suspicious because the shipment weight a lot more than others
the importer had received, he said.
   ``The inspector ... searched intensively and found 6,000 pounds
of cocaine concealed in blocks of chocolate,'' he said. ``The
computer said, `Let it go.' The person said, `Wait a minute.'''

<HEAD>In Republican Nebraska, Democrat Kerrey Top Contender for Senate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUB 9th graf bgng ``No'' to add audience response</NOTE>

   The Republican designation next to a
candidate's name in Nebraska usually means an election winner, but
Democrat Bob Kerrey has emerged as the leading contender for the
state's U.S. Senate seat.
   ``In this state, George Bush will win if all he is doing is
breathing that day,'' state Sen. Ernie Chambers, the New Alliance
Party candidate for the Senate, said referring to the GOP
presidential nominee.
   Only one Democratic presidential candidate, Lyndon B. Johnson,
has carried Nebraska since Franklin D. Roosevelt's win in 1936.
   ``This is a Republican state,'' said Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb.,
the 77-year-old grand dame of Nebraska politics. ``Nebraskans'
philosophy is a relatively conservative philosophy.''
   But the 45-year-old Kerrey, former governor of Nebraska, leads
Republican Sen. David Karnes by more than 20 points in recent
statewide polls, and political observers are hard-pressed when asked
for clear reasons.
   Some cite Kerrey's record in the Vietnam War where he lost part
of his leg and received the Medal of Honor. Others attribute his
success to good looks and star quality; Kerrey attracted national
attention when he dated actress Debra Winger.
   Still others believe Kerrey's independence from the Democratic
Party makes him appealing to Nebraskans.
   At a recent Rotary Club speech, Kerrey was asked if he could
provide one good reason, other than his party affiliation, for
supporting Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``No,'' Kerrey replied, sending his audience into peals of
laughter.
   He later explained to the group that he supports the Democratic
ticket but that he and the White House contender don't agree on
everything.
   ``Bob Kerrey is a unique individual who personifies certain
traits that Nebraskans respect,'' said Dave Heineman, an adviser to
Rep. Hal Daub, R-Neb. ``He is uniquely different.''
   To make matters worse for Republicans, Karnes has encountered a
series of problems since his appointment by GOP Gov. Kay Orr to the
Senate after the death of Ed Zorinsky.
   Many Republicans believed Daub deserved the appointment, and
although Karnes and his backers say the wounds have healed others
say bad feelings still exist.
   ``There is a deep wound, a deep split in the Republican Party,''
said Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., a former governor now in his second
term in the Senate.
   ``Hal Daub had done his homework and carried the water for the
elephants for a long time. He was entitled more to the job and then
he was hit in the head with a two-by-four by the Republican
governor,'' Exon said.
   Daub challenged Karnes in a heated May primary and was favored,
but Karnes scored an upset win.
   In the one and only debate between Kerrey and Karnes, the
Republican candidate elicited boos from some in the crowd of 2,000
when he said, ``We need fewer farmers at this point in time.''
   Karnes, who has an interest in a family farm in central Nebraska
and whose commercials have portrayed him as a ``farmer senator,''
later said he misspoke.
   ``I obviously don't support that statement,'' he said.
   Karnes also encountered some difficulties when he noted that the
list of ``Hollywood-types'' supporting Kerrey include Jane Fonda,
who came under attack for her wartime visit to North Vietnam.
   Kerrey angrily denied any association with Fonda, saying her trip
during the war hurt him and his fellow soldiers. The Democrat's
staff pointed out that while Kerrey was earning the Medal of Honor,
Karnes was using college draft deferments.
   ``I have not gone through Dave Karnes' campaign list and said
`Gee, you're going to be beholden to Donald Trump because he holds a
fund-raiser for you,'' Kerrey said. ``It's just old politics and the
anger that I feel toward Jane Fonda is that I and a lot of other
Vietnam vets suffered as a result of her actions.
   ``I understand she is connected to this political action
committee, but she has made no direct contribution to me and I
wouldn't accept it.''
   Karnes says his ideals are more in tune with those of the late
Zorinsky than are Kerrey's.
   ``Ed Zorinsky was a conservative. He voted a number of times with
President Reagan. That's why he was popular. It wasn't because he
dated a movie star,'' Karnes said.

   A federal judge today delayed indefinitely the
arraignment of Ferdinand Marcos on racketeering charges, but ordered
the wife of the deposed Philippine president to appear in New York
on Monday.
   ``I am adjourning sine die (without date) the arraignment of
President Marcos,'' said U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan after
defense lawyers presented him with doctors' letters saying Marcos
was too ill to travel the 5,000 miles from Hawaii.
   But Keenan refused to delay the arraignment of Imelda Marcos,
who, like her 71-year-old husband, was indicted last week for an
alleged scheme that looted their homeland's treasury of more than
$100 million.
   ``I see no reason at all to delay her arraignment,'' said Keenan,
despite pleas from Marcos attorney Richard A. Hibey about the
lengthy flight to New York from Honolulu, where the Marcoses have
lived since fleeing the Philippines in February 1986.
   The Marcoses were indicted Friday in U.S. District Court in New
York.
   In Honolulu, lawyers had said a private jet owned by a tobacco
heiress was at the ready to fly Marcos and his wife to New York if
the arraignment was to be held there.
   Doris Duke, 74, who owns a mansion in the exclusive Honolulu
ocean-front neighborhood of Black Point, had agreed to lend Marcos
her specially equipped Boeing 737-300 if federal officials rejected
his lawyers' request to move Monday's arraignment from New York.
   ``We have asked Mrs. Duke for the use of her plane and she
graciously agreed,'' said Marcos attorney John Bartko. ``The
government knows that, we had to tell them what arrangements were
being made.''
   Marcos lawyers contend the 71-year-old Marcos is too frail to
make the trip for such a simple proceeding.
   Marcos is prohibited by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service from leaving the island of Oahu without filing a written
application.

<HEAD>Detroit Legal Chief Jailed for Refusing to Release Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's legal director, jailed on contempt of
court charges, says Detroit officials broke no laws in spending
$42.1 million to assist in an industrial development project.
   Wayne County Circuit Judge James Rashid this week ordered
Corporation Counsel Donald Pailen held indefinitely in the county
jail after Pailen refused to supply The Detroit News with public
records related to its 1987 purchase of 15 acres of riverfront
property for construction of a Chrysler Corp. assembly plant.
   But Mayor Coleman A. Young praised the city's top lawyer
Wednesday for defying Rashid's order and going to jail.
   ``I think he's a hero,'' Young said. ``I think he's standing up
for all of our rights. And I'm proud of him. The principle here is
how much license does the press have to destroy people's
reputations. That's why Don Pailen is in jail.''
   Other city officials had joined Pailen in arguing that the
documents should be withheld while a federal grand jury investigated
the transaction.
   ``We, of course, take the position that there is no criminal
wrongdoing associated with anything related to this deal,'' Pailen
said Tuesday after calling a WXYT-AM talk-show host collect from his
cell.
   ``In this case, the grand jury convened to look into this issue.
They should be the ones to determine the truth of the matter,'' he
said. ``This is not a situation in our view that should be dealt
with and tried on the front page of the press.''
   Detroit officials have asked the Michigan Supreme Court to stay
Rashid's order to release the documents and to stay the judge's
decision to hold Pailen in civil contempt of court. The court had
not acted on those requests by Wednesday afternoon, clerk Monica
Kohmetscher said.
   ``I make no apologies (and) no excuses'' for refusing to release
the documents, Pailen told WXYT. ``It is my principle of law, and I
think it's one the courts will ultimately have to recognize as
having validity. Until that happens, I'm content to be here.''
   Pailen is segregated from other inmates in the 1,551-bed facility
and has been conducting limited office work, officials said.

   A couple wanted in connection with the killing
of an undercover police officer, recently re-enacted on the program
``America's Most Wanted,'' surrendered today to a television
reporter, police said.
   Kirkton Phenor Moore, 27, and his girlfriend, Raylene Brooks, 17,
were escorted into the Hollywood police station at 4:30 a.m. by
Moore's mother and KTLA-TV reporter Warren Wilson, said police Sgt.
Jeff Willis.
   The two were wanted in connection with the Sept. 3 killing of
Officer Daniel Pratt, 30. The six-year police veteran and father of
three was shot in the face while he and his partner were tailing a
car suspected in an earlier attack in which three people were
wounded, authorities said.
   The suspect car turned around and headed toward the officers and
shots were fired from an automatic rifle, police said. Pratt's
partner fired back and was not hit, police said.
   Authorities suspect Moore fired the shots while Ms. Brooks drove
the car.
   The officer's killing was re-enacted Sunday on Fox Television's
``America's Most Wanted'' series.
   The City Council and the Los Angeles Police Protective League
offered a $40,000 reward for the couple's capture.
   A policeman who spoke on condition he not be identified said the
couple called Wilson from Las Vegas and the reporter met them there.
Wilson could not immediately reached for comment early today. An
early call to KTLA was not answered.

<TEXT>
   A woman nearly blinded by glaucoma
is happily puffing on her first shipment of government-grown
marijuana _ a drug federal officials took months to approve for her
medical use.
   ``This is going to mean I'm not going to wonder where my next
dosage of medication is going to come from,'' said Elvy Musikka at a
Wednesday press conference to announce the government's decision.
   Ms. Musikka, 44, was tried in August on charges of growing
marijuana plants in her back yard. She and her physician
successfully argued that using the drug was the only way to relieve
glaucoma's pressure on her eyes.
   After her arrest eight months ago, she applied to the Food and
Drug Administration for a federal program to receive pot legally for
medical treatments.
   Ms. Musikka, who is already blind in her right eye, said she was
slowly losing the remaining sight in her left eye waiting for her
application to be processed.
   Her first monthly supply of 300 free marijuana cigarettes arrived
at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami on Friday, Ms. Musikka
said.
   She now carries a brown plastic container for her marijuana
cigarettes. She is said to be only the third person in the United
States given permission to smoke the drug legally for medical
reasons.
   Ms. Musikka hopes the marijuana will save the 10 percent eyesight
she has left.
   ``Ten percent is not much,'' said Ms. Musikka, who says she had
smoked marijuana for 12 years before her arrest. ``But that's a
whole lot better than none at all. When your vision is gone, it
can't be replaced.''
   She can use the marijuana anywhere tobacco smoking is permitted,
said her attorney Norman Kent.
   At the news conference, Kent lauded the FDA, the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, each of
which had to approve Ms. Musikka's application for marijuana.

<TEXT>
   Five Palestinians shouted ``Revolution
Until Victory'' today after they were sentenced to hang for
terrorist attacks that killed five Britons and two Sudanese.
   Judge Ahmed Bashir pronounced the five guilty of murder in the
bombing of a hotel and a gun attack on a social club, both of which
occurred in May.
   The attacks also injured 20 people, including three Americans.
The five British deaths included a family of four.
   No date was set for the five to hang. Jalal Aly Lutfy, the chief
defense lawyer, said he would file an appeal within the required 40
days.
   Court records identified the Palestinians as Imad Ahmed Huello,
Hassan Gasim Nimir, Sharif Ismat Atwa, Mustafa Arif and Ibrahim Ali.
   The sentencing hearing had been postponed four times.
   After the third postponement Oct. 17, the United States expressed
concern over reports in Khartoum that Abu Nidal, a Palestinian
terrorist whose group has been linked to many terror attacks, was
trying to buy lenient treatment for the accused in exchange for
money to help flood victims.
   Sudanese security sources said in May that two of the convicted
men told investigators they were members of Abu Nidal's group.
   The sources quoted the two men as saying the attacks were meant
to avenge the assassination of Khalil Wazir, or Abu Jihad, a close
adviser to Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
Wazir was killed at his home earlier this year in Tunis, the capital
of Tunisia, by commandos which Arab and other sources linked to
Israeli intelligence.
   However, Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi of Sudan issued a statement
Wednesday saying he believed the five have no connection with
Palestinian organizations.
   ``This is because the only profiting side from such acts which
were committed by the said element is the Zionist entity,'' or
Israel, he said without elaborating.

   Terry Anderson, the longest-held foreign
hostage in Lebanon, turned 41 today and spent a fourth consecutive
birthday in captivity.
   Pro-Iranian militants holding him again denied any links to a
woman who was arrested in Italy carrying a photograph of the
American journalist.
   The statement by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, was
delivered to a Western news agency and accompanied by an old photo
of Anderson.
   The statement did not provide any information on Anderson or
another American the group is holding, Thomas Sutherland.
   It was devoted to denying links to the Lebanese woman, Aline
Rizkallah, 36, who was arrested at Milan airport last week. A
photograph of Anderson, another American hostage, Alann Steen, and a
third picture of an unidentified man were found in her luggage along
with a letter purportedly from Steen.
   Police in Milan said today the letter appears to be a fake. They
say the photos and the letter were supposed to go to a U.S.
organization through an Italian arms dealer. Police said the woman
also was carrying heroin.
   Another underground faction, called the Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine has claimed Steen's abduction. But Western
and Lebanese intelligence services say the two groups are linked,
operating under the umbrella of Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's
main proxy force in Lebanon.
   The Italian police and reporters who saw the pictures found with
Ms. Rizkallah have said Anderson's picture appeared to be a
reproduction of an old one released by the kidnappers in 1987. That
of Steen apparently was taken off a video tape his captors had
released of him.
   Today's statement by Islamic Jihad said her photo of Anderson was
a ``reverse print'' of a one they released on Aug. 2, 1987. The
group has issued 13 photographs of Anderson since his abduction
March 16, 1985. He is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages in
Lebanon.
   The statement was 22 lines long. It was typewritten in Arabic. To
prove its theory of the reproduced photograph, the envelope
contained an original copy of the old photograph of Anderson and a
photocopy of a reproduction. The reproduction looked identical to
what was found with Ms. Rizkallah.
   Anderson, wearing a bushy beard, appeared in the original
photograph looking straight into the camera with the head slightly
inclined to the right. In the reproduction, the head appeared
inclined to the left.
   ``The Italian government is held responsible for publishing all
the details about this case. It is also accused of complicity with
the so-called Aline Rizkallah in coordination with the Israeli and
American intelligence services until proven otherwise,'' the
statement said.
   ``We renew our warning to all local and foreign (news) agencies
against manipulating and trading with the photographs and documents
which we attach to our statements and which we hope they will be
published in full in line with journalistic honesty,'' the statement
added.
   Anderson, of Lorain, Ohio, is chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. Sutherland, 57, a native of Fort Collins,
Col., is acting dean of agriculture at the American University of
Beirut.
   In its statement on Monday, Islamic Jihad denied links with Ms.
Rizkallah and claimed she was connected with the Israeli secret
service.

<TEXT>
   A Playboy magazine photographer will not
be allowed to screen Providence College students for a ``Women of
the Big East'' pictorial at either the Roman Catholic college or a
Providence hotel, officials said.
   Photographer David Mecey had planned to meet with Providence
College students for part of a Big East athletic conference layout
scheduled for the April 1989 issue, Playboy spokeswoman Cindy
Rakowitz said from New York.
   Mecey, who planned to stay in Providence from Wednesday through
Friday, intended to interview and photograph women in various
locations, including the Providence Marriott Inn where he had a
reservation. The planned feature would include nude and semi-nude
photos.
   The hotel's name and number were listed on a Playboy leaflet and
in a quarter-page advertisement to appear in today's edition of The
NewPaper, said Anne Trumbore, an employee at the weekly alternative
newspaper.
   But Stephen McCarthy, the hotel's resident manager, said that
when officials realized Wednesday morning who Mecey was, they
decided not to allow him to conduct business at the hotel. Mecey was
told by hotel officials when he arrived Wednesday night that he
could not conduct interviews on hotel property.
   ``If he wants to stay here, he can. He has rented a room and we
are in the business of renting rooms,'' said general manager Rene
Neidhart. ``But he did not have our authorization to use our name in
any advertisements, and he cannot interview or photograph in the
hotel.''
   ``I'm not entirely taken aback, but I think that's pretty
drastic,'' said Rakowitz when informed of the Marriott's decision.
``That's sort of eliminating the rights of the individual to make a
freedom of choice _ but a hotel is private property.''
   Playboy also was banned from interviewing or staying at the
Sheraton Tara in Braintree, Mass., when it interviews Boston College
students in mid-November, said Jeff Cohen, Playboy's managing photo
editor.
   Some people who arrived at the Marriott looking for Mecey were
escorted off hotel property by security guards, said McCarthy. He
said several people, both women and men, were removed from the lobby
and floors.
   Playboy had decided against seeking the cooperation of
administrators at any of the schools it will visit, deciding instead
to advertise off-campus and in college newspapers.
   Playboy had hoped to run an ad in the Cowl, the student newspaper
at the 3,800-student college, but students and administrators
decided against it, said a school spokesman, the Rev. John McGreevy.
   Officials at St. John's University in New York, another Catholic
school, decided earlier this month against running an article about
the Playboy feature in its student newspaper.
   ``I'm still confident that we will recruit our women,'' said
Rakowitz, who said about 20 women were wanted for the feature.
``I've never come into a problem at a hotel. I think it's sort of
repressing.''
   Other schools in the Big East Conference are Villanova
University, in Villanova, Pa.; Washington's Georgetown University;
Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J.; the University of
Connecticut; the University of Pittsburgh; and New York's Syracuse
University.

   The death of an unidentified man has pushed the
District of Columbia's 1988 homicide rate to within one of the
city's all-time total, a police spokesman said today.
   The victim found shot to death Wednesday night was the city's
286th reported homicide since Jan. 1, 1988, said police officer
Walter Ferguson. The highest homicide total, 287, was recorded in
1969. There were 227 homicides in the district last year.
   Police attributed the increase to violent turf battles by drug
dealers in the city. Authorities estimate that 60 percent of this
year's killings have been drug-related, compared to 1987 when 33
percent of the homicides involved drugs.
   It was not known if the most recent slaying was drug-related,
Ferguson said.
   ``We don't have organized crime in this city, so we have a lot of
young entrepreneurs fighting for turf,'' Police Chief Maurice T.
Turner said Wednesday during a news conference on the homicide rate.

   Heeding arguments by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, President Reagan is vetoing a ``whistleblower'' bill to
protect government workers who report wrongdoing.
   The Justice Department contends the measure, approved by Congress
without a single dissenting vote, has constitutional problems and
would interfere with legitimate discipline of employees, Justice
Department spokesman Loye Miller said today.
   The president said Wednesday he will exercise his ``pocket veto''
power of killing a bill by refusing to sign it while Congress is not
in session.
   It had passed the House by 418-0 and the Senate by a unanimous
voice vote.
   The measure would have given major new protections to federal
workers who expose fraud and mismanagement. Reagan said it would
have allowed employees ``who are not genuine whistleblowers'' to
manipulate the process to delay or avoid proper discipline.
   ``I regret that the Congress did not present me with
constitutional and effective legislation to expand the protections
and procedural rights afforded to federal employees who report
fraud, waste and abuse they discover in federal programs,'' Reagan's
memorandum said.
   ``The interests of both employees and managers should be fully
protected,'' the president said. He pledged to submit his own bill
in January when Congress returns.
   The Justice Department under both Thornburgh and his predecessor,
Edwin Meese III, has consistently opposed the bill, said Miller,
Thornburgh's spokesman.
   Miller said Thornburgh presented the department's case at a White
House meeting Wednesday.
   Thornburgh, in a statement released by his office, said that
while the bill ``contains some worthwhile elements, some of which we
would urge be introduced next session, it also contained elements
which would violate provisions of our constitution.
   ``The bill would have resulted in the executive branch filing
suit in federal court against itself. This it cannot do, just as no
person can file suit against himself,'' said Thornburgh.
   Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y., a member of the House Government
Operations, said he was surprised by the veto because he had only
agreed to bring the bill to a floor vote after the White House had
given its approval. But the administration ``reneged on what was
agreed to,'' Horton told The Washington Post.
   Sponsors said the whistleblower bill was needed because the
Office of Special Counsel, established to represent the interests of
whistleblowers, was not doing its job.
   The bill was designed to reverse decisions of courts and the
Merit Systems Protection Board, a federal judicial agency, that made
it difficult for whistleblowers to win their cases.
   The bill would have made the Office of Special Counsel an
independent agency and would have defined its role clearly as one of
protecting whistleblowers. The office now is part of the Merit
Systems Protection Board and at times it has acted against
whistleblowers who came to the office for help.
   Reagan said he opposed provisions in the bill that would have
altered the burden of proof in whistleblower cases. The measure
would have required an employee to show only that the agency's
knowledge of the whistleblowing was a factor in his or her
punishment, rather than a ``significant'' or ``dominant'' factor as
required under current law.
   Agencies also would have had to show by ``clear and convincing
evidence'' that the same disciplinary decision would have occurred
in the absence of any whistleblowing.
   The change ``essentially rigs the board's process against agency
personnel managers in favor of employees,'' the president said.
   Reagan also said the bill would have caused constitutional
problems because it would have allowed executive branch agencies to
go to court against each other. The president has the power to
resolve disputes between his subordinates, he said.
   However, Tom Devine, legal director of the Government
Accountability Project nonprofit group, said the veto ``is
equivalent to endorsing continued reprisals against whistleblowers
who challenge bureaucratic abuses. This issue isn't going to go
away. ... We'll be back next year arguing for a stronger
whistleblower protection law and we'll win.''
   Devine, whose group provides aid to whistleblowers, said there
was precedent for federal agencies to challenge executive branch
decisions. He said the bill would have imposed whistleblower
standards that now are in use in private industry.
   ``Those same legal burdens haven't interfered with private
industry's ability to fire incompetent workers,'' Devine said.

   Democrat presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis declared today that ``this election is up for grabs'' and
ridiculed Republican rival George Bush's assertion that his proposal
for cutting the capital gains tax would create new jobs.
   ``Who's he kidding?'' Dukakis asked supporters in this Chicago
suburb. ``What are they going to do with the extra money? Hire a
second butler, a lifeguard for the pool?''
   The Massachusetts governor said Bush's plan to reduce the top
capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 15 percent was not a jobs
program but a huge tax break for the vice president and his wealthy
friends. Bush says it would spur business investment and generate
new jobs.
   ``It's Halloween come early,'' Dukakis said. ``A treat for the
wealthiest 1 percent and a trick for the rest of us.''
   One day after the GOP nominee touted his tax plan before Detroit
business leaders, Dukakis said Bush really was proposing to ``give
the the people at the top the money and hope the crumbs fall off for
the rest of us.''
   He also rebuked Bush's vice presidential running mate, Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana, for opposing legislation that would require
employers to give workers 60 days' notice of mass layoffs or plant
closings.
   The Democratic nominee, struggling to reverse his slide in the
polls in the nation's industrial heartland, cloaked himself in the
memory of Harry Truman's upset victory over Republican Thomas E.
Dewey in 1948.
   ``Harry Truman was a fighter and so am I,'' Dukakis said. ``My
friends, this election is up for grabs.''
   From Evergreen Park, he headed for Rockford in northern Illinois
and was ending the day with a town meeting in Independence, Mo.,
Truman's birthplace. Dukakis also was appearing on the CBS Evening
News tonight.
   At a town meeting Monday night in the Chicago suburb of
Naperaville, Dukakis delivered a broad swipe Monday at what he
called Bush's nasty campaigning and distortions of his positions on
defense, the environment, crime and gun controls. The session was
broadcast nationally on the C-SPAN cable TV network.
   ``This is not a campaign about furloughs and flag factories,''
Dukakis said at a high school in this Chicago suburb. ``This is a
campaign about the future of America. And especially about young
people.''
   He also sought to lay claim to the high ground in the campaign, a
position Dukakis hopes will sway undecided and soft Bush supporters
in the 12 days before the election.
   ``I don't think politics ought to be an enterprise in which all
we do is cut the other guy up,'' Dukakis said. ``Obviously, Mr. Bush
disagrees. I think it's a disservice to the American people.''
   The latest statewide survey in Missouri showed Bush's late August
nine-point lead cut to one as the vice president led Dukakis 44-43
percent, according to today's editions of The Kansas City Times.
   The survey of 550 likely voters, conducted Sunday and Monday, had
a margin of error of plus or minus four points.
   Dukakis has blamed his slide in national polls on a litany of
unfounded GOP allegations left unanswered, but his audience in
Naperville and three other cities asked questions that allowed
Dukakis to respond to the salvos. In addition to the C-Span
broadcast, the session was shown simultaneously at meetings in
Rochester, N.Y., Johnstown, Pa., and Green Bay, Wis.
   At the Naperville forum, Dukakis said a Bush ad showing Dukakis
riding in an Army tank misrepresented his position on several
weapons systems and also accused the vice president of proving he
lacked leaderhip credentials by failing to outline weapons systems
he would select at a time when both candidates project stable
defense spending.
   ``Mr. Bush has never met a weapons system he didn't like,''
Dukakis said.
   In an interview with The Washington Post, published in today's
editions, Dukakis conceded that he may have erred at the Democratic
National Convention when he said, ``this campaign is not about
ideology _ it's about competence.''
   The Democratic nominee said that he might have used his first
speech to a national audience to lay out ``values and philosophy ...
fundamental differences between me and George Bush.''
   ``Should the speech in Atlanta have been more explicit, more of a
statement of philosophy, positions?'' he said. ``Perhaps.''
   At a rowdy noontime rally Wednesday in Pueblo, Colo., Dukakis
also accused the National Rifle Association of distoring his
position on gun control.
   Dukakis said he supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen to
own guns and for homeowners to purchase guns to protect their homes.
   He then chided Bush for not taking a position on legislation to
provide a seven-day waiting period to allow police to conduct
background checks before approving gun sales.

<HEAD>Jury Out in Case of Father Whose Son Died for Lack of Medical

   The jury is deliberating in the
manslaughter trial of a faith-healing church deacon, branded by a
prosecutor as ``a fanatic'' for failing to seek medical treatment
before his 10-year-old diabetic son died.
   Bobby Da Norman, 43, is charged with first-degree manslaughter
for failing to get treatment for his son, Aaron, who died Dec. 20 of
untreated juvenile diabetes. A similar charge against his wife,
Judith, was dropped before the case went to trial.
   The Normans were members of a nameless Christian sect that
rejected conventional medicine, demanded strict discipline of
children and adults and viewed its leaders as prophets.
   Jurors got the case late Wednesday and deliberated about 3{ hours
before being sent home for the night. They were to resume their work
later today.
   In closing arguments Wednesday, deputy Spokane County prosecutor
Clark Colwell said Norman, a deacon in the sect, ``got wrapped up in
this, just like the rest of them. He became a fanatic, just like the
rest of them.''
   A parent has a duty to provide medical care for a dependent
child, and Norman recklessly failed to meet that obligation, Colwell
said.
   Defense lawyer Roger Peven argued that Norman's religious fervor
blinded him to the danger his son faced.
   Peven said Norman was steeped in fellowship teachings for seven
years and was unable to break free of that doctrine in the four days
his son's illness became apparent.
   Spanking the boy the day before he died, ostensibly to get him to
confess to some sin that sect leaders believed was making him ill,
exacerbated the juvenile diabetes that made him look ``like a
concentration camp victim,'' Colwell said.
   ``We've all experienced different kinds of discipline in our
lives ... but this was outside the bounds of any reasonable case,''
he said. ``This was a sick child. This was a child who was dying.''
   Peven conceded that the boy died of diabetes, that he would have
lived if medical treatment had been sought and that Norman failed to
seek medical treatment.
   Sect leaders, including founder Doug Kleber, who helped spank
Aaron during a confrontive questioning session the day before he
died, exerted tremendous influence over members' lives, Peven said.
   Kleber and former Spokane pastor Jeffrey Siegel, both 34, pleaded
guilty earlier to second-degree criminal mistreatment. Three other
former elders of the fellowship, which disbanded shortly after the
boy died, face trial on similar charges next year.

<HEAD>Drug Company Official Says Distribution Could Resume</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   An official of the French pharmaceutical company
that suspended distribution of the abortion pill RU 486 said today
the pill could become available again if public opposition to it
subsides.
   A communique issued by the company Wednesday said distribution of
the drug worldwide was stopped in response to an ``outcry of public
opinion at home and abroad.'' The story was front-page news in
French and U.S. newspapers.
   The company's decision to suspend distribution was hailed by two
anti-abortion groups in France but criticized by government.
   Michele Andre, the Cabinet minister responsible for women's
rights, told a news conference the drug company's decision was a
``disagreable blow.''
   ``I think that all of a sudden this company gave in to pressure
from a large number of people,'' she said. ``Often questions
involving morals and women bring about a backlash.''
   She indicated she would contact the Ministry of Health to see
what could be done about getting other pharmaceutical companies to
produce the drug.
   Pierre Joly, vice president of the pharmaceutical company that
makes the pill, Roussel-Uclaf, said today on French radio, ``We
could resume distribution of RU 486 if the atmosphere returns to
normal.''
   Joly denied reports the company halted distribution because it
feared a threatened boycott of its other products.
   ``A boycott could only be carried out by doctors who have to put
the interests of their patients above everything else,'' he said.
   When the French government last month authorized use of the
anti-hormone substance in registered abortion clinics, Joly said a
controversy developed.
   ``Public opinion was unleashed. We witnessed an orchestrated
campaign that grew in strength,'' he said, referring to
anti-abortion groups in the United States, France and West Germany.
   One French anti-abortion group, the Committee To Save Infants to
be Born, called for the ``destruction of all the stocks of this
chemical weapon RU486.'' Another, the National Circle of European
Women, said the decision to halt distribution was a ``great victory
for women and for families who mobilized to bring about suppression
of the drug and everyday acceptance of abortion in favor of pro-life
measures.''
   The Socialist Party and Communist parties protested the decision.
   The Socialists denounced the company's action as a ``new attack
on the freedom of women to choose a new medical method.'' The
statement said the Socialists, who lead the present French
government, were astonished at the move, announced one month after
the Ministry of Health authorized the drug.
   The Marseille daily Le Provencal said in an editorial that when
the pill was invented the World Health Organization welcomed it,
China was enthusiastic and the United States said it met all medical
specifications.
   ``It is true that the religious authorities and the right-to-life
groups were shocked by this progress,'' the paper said. ``But all
the same, are we going to be without a voice when confronted with
these fundamentalist manifestations of faith against science and
against the law?''
   The company's decision was hailed by Cardinal Albert Decourtray,
head of the French Roman Catholic conference of bishops.
   At the Ministry of Health, which authorized prescription of the
drug Sept. 23 subject to strict medical supervision, an official
said the decision ``makes one wonder about who's in charge'' at
Roussel-Uclaf.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
regretted that the company decided to stop distribution after all
the research, medical trials and other steps necessary to get the
pill to the market.
   He said he was surprised by the reasons the company gave because
``in France, anyway, the protests were pretty weak and did not lead
to either catastrophe or strong feelings. The company acted to
preserve its image abroad.''
   The official said the government could not reverse the decision
because it was a minority shareholder in the Paris-based company.
The majority shareholder is the West German chemical group Hoechst.
   The pill, also known as Mifepristone, is an anti-hormone that
acts by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone essential in
all phases of pregnancy. Researchers say it is highly effective in
the first seven weeks of pregnancy, particularly when used in
conjunction with a second product called Sulprotone, or
prostaglandine E.
   The new drug is not a do-it-yourself morning after pill that can
be purchased at the supermarket and taken at home.
   It must be used under medical supervision.

   Sen Dan Quayle said today that Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has tried to keep his ideology
from the American people in a ``cynical political move.''
   Quayle, addressing a breakfast of several hundred supporters at
the Grove Park Inn resort, said the Republicans are ``the party of
the future ... we're the ones that are out there talking about
ideas.''
   Recalling Dukakis' statement at the Democratic convention that
the election is about competence rather than ideas, Quayle said, ``I
can tell you ideology is important. Ideas are important, and to
think you can fool the American people by not talking about ideology
was a cynical political move that will not work.''
   Keeping up the Republican strategy of portraying the
Massachusetts governor as a liberal who is out of step with
mainstream America, Quayle said, ``Liberalism is a philosophy of the
past. It is a philosophy that failed.''
   On another subject, Quayle said to reporters in Asheville that
homelessness in America is not due to a lack of low-income housing.
   ``I would guess that there's adequate low-income housing in the
country today but that doesn't mean that is the only answer or the
solution to the problem. That's one of them, and if we can find out
it is not adequate low-income housing we'll have to see what we can
do about it,'' Quayle said.
   ``It's a problem that we're going to have to identify. First, who
are the homeless? What are their needs? Are they on the streets
because they don't have adequate housing?''
   He added, ``I bet you will find maybe in some cases that there is
some housing. Are there some volunteer shelters that can be used?''
   Later, Quayle was heading to Charlotte, N.C. for a rally at the
University of North Carolina, and then traveling to campaign stops
in New Jersey and New York.
   A day earlier, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Quayle noted the recent
frequent television appearances by Dukakis and Democratic running
mate Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``Actually I think it's their swan song,'' he said, talking to
reporters as he left a fund-raising event. ``A nice way for Michael
Dukakis to say goodbye to America.
   ``I think Sen. Bentsen has a different agenda. He's been very
good at pumping himself up. He hasn't been too good at pumping up
Michael Dukakis. As a matter of fact he talks more about himself
than he does the top of the ticket. I don't blame him.''
   Quayle made the comments as a new CBS-New York Times poll showed
Bush with a 13-point lead over Dukakis. A Los Angeles Times poll
gave Bush an 11-point lead in the critical state of California.
   In Florida, Quayle also stumped in Miami's Little Havana district
on Wednesday and he was enthusiastically received at a rally of
about 400 Cuban-Americans.
   He told them that being in the Cuban community, ``I have been
able to feel the spirit of America.''
   He said he and Bush ``will invest in our people, quality
education, job opportunity, family, neighborhood and, yes, a thing
we call America. A thing we call America because this country is
still the beacon of hope for millions around the world.''
   Earlier, at Miami High School, which Quayle aide Jim Ciccone said
has a high dropout rate and a 90-percent Hispanic student body,
Quayle promised that a Bush administration would make sure anyone
who wants to has the opportunity to go to college.
   Answering a question on immigration, Quayle told the students:
``The United States of America will always have an open door policy
... We all are from somewhere.'' He told them his own ancestors were
from the Isle of Man.
   In his home state of Indiana, the state Supreme Court rejected on
Wednesday two requests to open his application to the bar.
   A Wisconsin attorney and The Indianapolis News had made separate
requests for the application under the Indiana Public Records Law.
   The application contains several questions asking whether the
applicant has been dishonest or had academic difficulties.
   Supreme Court Administrator Karl Mulvaney said the court cited a
provision allowing exemption of records ``declared confidential by
or under rules adopted by the supreme court of Indiana.''

   A prison-supply supervisor was beaten to
death early today, apparently by a pipe-wielding inmate, prompting a
lockdown at Stateville Correctional Center, a Department of
Corrections spokesman said.
   ``The entire institution is under lockdown,'' said Nic Howell of
the agency. ``It will stay on indefitnitely ... until we get to the
bottom of this.''
   The employee was identified as Suon Treoung, 53, of Romeoville.
He was pronounced dead on arrival at Silver Cross Hospital, Howell
said.
   An inmate discovered near the prison supply store, where
Treoung's body was discovered at about 7 a.m., was taken into
custody and held in the prison's segregation unit, the spokesman
said.
   ``We did recover some physical evidence that links the inmate to
the attack,'' said Howell. ``We also recovered a piece of pipe we
believe may have been used in the attack.''
   He declined to identify the inmate suspected in the attack, but
did say the man was serving a 60-year term after his conviction for
a 1981 murder in Cook County.
   He said the investigation would be turned over to the Will County
state's attorney's office.

<TEXT>
   Soviet officials said today they will start
liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the
nation's economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach $58
billion next year.
   ``A number of enterprises are on the brink of being eliminated,''
Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the 1,500 deputies of the Supreme
Soviet legislature. They gathered today at the Grand Kremlin Palace
in Moscow for a two-day session on a 1989 development plan and $804
billion government budget.
   Gostev, who presented the deficit budget to the lawmakers,
admitted the government of Mikhail S. Gorbachev is finding it
difficult to bring deficit spending under control. The overspending
began in previous Soviet regimes.
   He said the deficit ``is a problem that has not emerged just now,
but is a result of the unbalanced economy, of the policy of
extensive subsidizing, and huge losses _ of all that was brought
about by extensive methods of economic management, parasitic
attitudes and a passive financial policy.''
   The economic report presented to the deputies painted a gloomy
picture of Soviet life with cramped housing, food rotting en route
to stores, jammed trains during vacation periods, and massive
amounts of new equipment lying unused on factory floors.
   However, the 1989 plan promised dramatic improvements in what
Yuri Maslyukov, head the state planning committee, acknowledged was
a response to criticism in the press and legislature.
   He said central planning will be slashed by restraining what
ministries can do. This year, the state bought and redistributed 86
percent of production, but it will buy just 25 percent next year.
Everything else must be sold on a new open market according to
consumer demand.
   ``The state will cease to be the sole distributor of resources,''
Maslyukov said.
   In another bow to public pressure, he listed several development
plans dropped due to environmental concerns, including two-thirds of
50 planned water projects.
   Gostev promised that pensions and payments to low-income families
will rise and that planned price reform will not lower the standard
of living.
   The new emphasis under Gorbachev on consumer goods and the
standard of living mark a major turnaround in Communist policy.
   As the deputies convened for the parliament's regular fall
session, one seat on the leadership dais was vacant. Politburo
member Yegor K. Ligachev, who is believed to be the major
conservative force, was separated by the empty chair from Gorbachev
and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   The arrangement of seats could symbolize a diminished role for
Ligachev, who was moved from Communist Party ideology chief to
agriculture minister earlier this month.
   Gostev, in presenting the state budget for next year, said the
deficit would be $58 billion, or 7 percent of the total budget, the
official Tass news agency said.
   The United States budget carries a deficit of about $100 billion.
   The 1989 draft budget, which is customarily approved by the
Supreme Soviet in a unanimous vote, also allocates $32.8 billion to
the country's armed forces, the same amount as in 1988, Gostev said.
   However, Western experts say the Soviet military budget is many
times that figure, because the armed forces also receive money
allocated for science, industry and other purposes. The CIA
estimates that the Soviet military budget is actually 15 percent of
the nation's total economy.

   A minister who was once Jessica Hahn's boss
was indicted today on charges he skimmed funds from his Long Island
church and then tried to persude Ms. Hahn to lie to a grand jury
about it.
   The Rev. Eugene Profeta, 51, was charged by an Albany County
grand jury of tax evasion, perjury and tampering with a witness. He
pleaded innocent and was being held pending $25,000 bail.
   Profeta was also ordered to surrender his passport, pilot's
license and gun license and was ordered to stay away from Ms. Hahn,
who was once a secretary in Profeta's church. Ms. Hahn's 1980 sexual
encounter with the Rev. Jim Bakker led to his resignation last year
from the PTL ministry.
   The charges allege that Profeta and his wife, Glenda, took some
$90,000 in funds from the Full Gospel Tabernacle Church in
Massapequa, N.Y., where Profeta was pastor.
   Profeta then used the money for private family functions, to buy
life insurance and stocks in his wife's name and for ``frequent
gambling junkets to Atlantic City,'' said Assistant New York
Attorney General Peter Crusco.

   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, also
said the government has offered to eliminate radar at two other
sites, both of which have been challenged by the United States.
   However, Gerasimov said the moves do not constitute an admission
the radar equipment violates the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
The pact bars the two superpowers from developing new defenses
against missiles.
   The United States has rejected anything short of dismantling the
giant radar station at Krasnoyarsk, which Gerasimov said will
instead be given to the Academy of Sciences. Washington says such
facilities must be located on the periphery of the Soviet Union, not
in the interior.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev previously offered to turn
over it over to a civilian agency. Gerasimov said it will be turned
into an international center for the study of space, as promised.
   He also said today the Kremlin was acting on U.S. complaints
about two other radar sites.
   ``We meant to use those elements for economic purposes, which is
not against the clauses of the ABM treaty,'' he said at today's
briefing for Soviet and foreign reporters.
   ``Being guided by the interests of preservation and strengthening
the ABM treaty, we are prepared to make another constructive step in
that regard; that is to eliminate the radar elements of Flat Twin
and Pawn Shop in the regions of Gomel and Moscow,'' he said.
   A U.S. State Department report in December 1987 charged the
locations of Flat Twin and Pawn Shop fall outside a permitted
deployment area or test range under the treaty. Asked later what he
meant by the offer to eliminate the radar components, Gerasimov
said, ``Eliminate them physically.''
   The spokesman repeated a call on the United States to take
similar measures with two radar sites the Soviets contend violate
the treaty, one in Greenland and one under construction in Britain.

   The governing National Party
and its far-right rivals claimed success today in white municipal
elections, but Archbishop Desmond Tutu said a boycott of separate
black voting succeeded.
   Only a tiny fraction of the country's 26 million blacks voted in
Wednesday's segregated elections, which the white government
described as the most significant extension of democracy in South
African history. An estimated one third of 1.5 million registered
blacks came to the polls.
   ``Manipulate statistics whichever way you like,'' said Tutu, who
advocated an election boycott. ``The reality remains that black
South Africans reject apartheid and government attempts to give it a
coat of new paint,'' said the winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the predominant blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate muncipal councils, schools and health services.
   The far-right Conservative Party, campaigning for stricter
enforcement of apartheid laws, had predicted victory in Pretoria,
the country's administrative capital. It narrowly missed its goal,
winning 19 council seats to 22 for the Nationalists.
   It also fell short of its targets in the Orange Free State, the
most rural of four provinces.
   But the Conservatives swept to power in farming and industrial
towns of Transvaal, the most populous province, where they won at
least 67 of 105 municipalities.
   The Nationalists for the first time gained outright control in
Johannesburg, the nation's largest city, but the Conservatives also
won seats on the council for the first time.
   Both the Conservatives and Nationalists said the results boded
well for their prospects in a general election, expected by early
1990.
   These were the first nationwide municipal elections contested by
the Conservative Party, which was established in 1980 by
disenchanted Nationalists.
   The elections also were the first in which South Africans of all
races voted on the same day. A total of 7,229 seats were contested,
most of them in white communities. Of the 1,839 seats available on
black councils, only 905 had more than one candidate.
   The white government declared itself satisfied with black turnout
and said some of the elected blacks might be asked to negotiate on
national issues. Blacks normally have no say at the national level.
   ``A significant percentage (of blacks) voted for peaceful
evolutionary change,'' said Constitutional Development Minister
Chris Heunis.
   State-run Radio South Africa estimated the black voter turnout at
about one-third nationwide. That would mean over 400,000 blacks cast
votes, compared to just under 300,000 in the last black municipal
elections in 1983.
   However, the population increased about 15 percent since then,
indicating only a minimal increase in black voter turnout.
   The black tournout ranged as high as 80 percent in some small
rural towns, but it was 11.5 percent in Soweto, the largest black
community.
   In many townships, there were no candidates or the number of
blacks eligible to vote was so low that the voting represented only
a fraction of the population. In Soweto, the votes cast represented
2.8 percent of adult residents.
   ``I see they (the government) are claiming today that hundreds of
thousands have voted and that the people elected have a solid
mandate,'' Tutu said at today's news conference. ``How can there be
a solid mandate when half the seats for blacks were not even
contested for the lack of interest? How does a 10 or 12 percentage
poll in Soweto constitute a solid mandate?''
   Government-run television said 25 percent of black registered
voters in Cape province cast ballots, 33 percent in Transvaal, 46
percent in the Orange Free State and 29 percent in Natal.
   Anti-apartheid activists, including many prominent clergymen,
said voting for separate local authorities represents an
entrenchment of the system of racial segregation.
   In the white elections, anti-apartheid candidates kept control of
Durban.

   Two men were convicted Thursday of
hijacking a jetliner with 118 people aboard from China to Taiwan in
May, and they were sentenced to 3{ years in prison.
   Chang Ching-kuo said he and fellow hijacker Lung Kuei-yun will
appeal their conviction to the Taiwan High Court because
``anti-communist defectors should not be guilty.''
   Chang, 27, told the court he and Lung, 26, hijacked the Boeing
737 of China's state-run Civil Aviation Administration of China on
May 12 to defect to Taiwan, stronghold of the rival Nationalist
Chinese government. He said they had not intended to harm the
passengers.
   The hijackers appeared surprised at the sentence because
prosecutors had urged leniency for the ``freedom-seekers.'' They
could have been sentenced to death.
   They used a toy gun and fake explosives to force the pilot to fly
to an air base in Taiwan shortly after the jetliner took off on a
domestic flight from Xiamen, across the Taiwan Strait, to Canton in
southern China.
   The Nationalist Chinese government granted them political asylum
and allowed the plane and its other passengers to return to China
five hours later.

   An Albanian couple was sentenced to

   The daily newspaper Borba said Isa and Zada Djokaj reportedly
asked for political asylum in Yugoslavia after they were arrested by

Albanian border.
   They said they decided to flee their country because they
``allegedly don't agree with policies conducted by Albania's
communist leadership,'' Borba reported.
   ``Propaganda material, which is being investigated, was found in
their bags,'' the nwspaper said, without elaboration.
   Borba did not say if the asylum would be granted to them after
their jail terms expire, or if they would be returned to their
country.
   Yugoslavia and Albania have been at odds over their ethnic
minorities living in the two countries.

<TEXT>
   The fall of a 16-ton steel sculpture that pinned
two art gallery workers to the floor, crushing one man's leg, was
the second accident involving one of artist Richard Serra's massive
and sometimes controversial works.
   The accident Wednesday at the Leo Castelli Gallery in Soho
occurred as the workers were removing the piece, ``Reading Cones,''
after an exhibition. A set of heavy-duty jacks collapsed and dropped
the artwork in the first-floor gallery, said Fire Department
spokesman Efrain Parrilla.
   In the early 1970s, a worker in Minneapolis was killed when part
of a Serra sculpture collapsed.
   At the Castelli Gallery, the sculpture knocked down two of nine
cast-iron structural support columns in the five-story loft
building. The building was evacuated for the remainder of the day
while city inspectors assessed the damage.
   Police officers were able to free one of the workers, Daniel
Hafner, almost immediately. But Joseph Gallo, 30, was pinned for
three to six minutes, police said.
   Surgeons were unable to save Gallo's right leg, which was
amputated below the knee, according to a Bellevue Hospital
administrator, John Clark, who said Gallo was admitted in serious
but stable condition.
   Hafner, in his 30s, was taken to Beekman-Downtown Hospital
complaining of shoulder and leg injuries, and was treated and
released, said a hospital spokeswoman, Maureen Flatley.
   A spokeswoman for the gallery, Susan Brundage, said the sculpture
was being placed in storage following a show.
   The curved piece of steel is 3 inches thick, 14 feet high, 17
feet long and weighs 32,000 pounds, she said.
   It was one of two identical pieces by Serra at the gallery, she
said. The two combined are priced at $200,000.
   Another Serra sculpture, ``Tilted Arc,'' has been the center of
controversy at a federal building in lower Manhattan.
   Critics, including more than 1,000 government employees who
signed a petition, want it moved. They say the 12-foot-high,
112-foot-long, rusting curve of metal obstructs views, sunlight and
traffic flow.
   In the early 1970s, a worker was killed while helping install a
two-piece Serra sculpture at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.
One of the sculpture's steel plates fell over.
   In a subsequent lawsuit, the jury found that the fault was with
the steel fabricator, for poor technique in making the piece, and
with the rigger for failing to follow instructions.
   Serra and the art center were absolved of any blame.

<HEAD>IRA Says It Killed Post Office Manager</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army today
claimed responsibility for killing a Post Office manager in a
booby-trap car bombing outside Belfast's main postal sorting center.
   The outlawed IRA, in a coded message to the media, gave no reason
for targeting Wilson Smith, 41, a postal transport manager and
father of three who police said had no connection with the security
forces.
   A bomb exploded under Smith's car in a multi-story parking garage
across the road from the sorting office moments after he drove
toward the exit Wednesday evening, police said.
   Fred Weir, spokesman for the Post Office Workers Union, said the
killing was ``an attack on the working class'' and could not be
justified. ``We serve both sides of the community,'' he said. ``We
deliver to all parts of Belfast.''
   In June 1987, another Post Office worker was killed in a similar
car bombing in the street outside the sorting office. Nathaniel
Cush, 47, had resigned weeks earlier from the Ulster Defense
Regiment, a predominantly Protestant auxiliary of the British army.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to rid
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland of British rule and unite the
province with the Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   A policeman, 20-year-old Hugh McCrone, was killed and his partner
seriously wounded when their car was ambushed Wednesday evening near
the village of Kinawley, 70 miles southwest of Belfast, police said.
   No one has claimed responsibility.

   NAACP executive director Benjamin Hooks
today ordered the head of the Columbus chapter to retract an
endorsement of Republican presidential candidate George Bush or face
immediate suspension.
   Columbus chapter president Melanie Mitchell said in a statement
Wednesday that the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People ``does not give political endorsements ... (but) we
must offer support to those persons who hold political offices, or
are seeking such offices, whose ideals, activities, practices or
policies are in the best interest of minorities.''
   In a news release issued from NAACP headquarters in Baltimore
today, Hooks said Ms. Mitchell has been ``directed to issue a public
statement repudiating, in its entirety, this position immediately.
... Failure to do so will result in your immediate suspension.''
   She was given until the end of the day to comply.
   Ms. Mitchell was not available for comment today, but chapter
vice president Cornell McCleary said Wednesday night that the
decision to support Bush was made because the overwhelming black
allegiance to the Democratic Party has been ``totally
counterproductive.''
   Bush ``believes in affirmative action. He always has believed in
it. He has sent a signal that there is a place for blacks in the
Republican Party,'' McCleary said.
   Bush's Ohio campaign chairman Keith McNamara said today the
campaign ``is delighted to have won this endorsement. It shows what
we have been saying all along that Bush has a good track record with
blacks and that he will win a larger portion of the black vote this
fall than even President Reagan did.''
   Danette Palmore, deputy manager of Michael Dukakis' Democratic
presidential campaign in Ohio, said the NAACP's support of Bush
threatens the group's non-profit status.
   ``I think they're skating on thin ice,'' Ms. Palmore said.
   Ms. Mitchell and McCleary are registered Republicans.

   Michael Dukakis renewed his attack today on George Bush's plan to
reduce capital gains taxes, suggesting it would merely help the rich
``hire a second butler.'' Bush accepted the endorsement of a
maritime union and praised U.S. and Soviet teams that worked to free
two ice-trapped whales.
   Campaigning less than two weeks before Election Day _ and four
days before Halloween _ Dukakis said today in Evergreen, Ill., that
Bush's tax plan was like ``Halloween come early _ a treat for the
wealthiest one percent and a trick for the rest of us.''
   The plan, Dukakis said, would ``give the people at the top the
money and hope the crumbs fall off for the rest of us.''
   Bush has proposed reducing the top tax rate from 33 percent to 15
percent for capital gains, such as profits from sales of stocks,
bonds or real estate. The Republican presidential nominee has
defended his plan as a potential boon to the U.S. economy,
contending people benefiting from the tax reduction would then
increase their investing.
   ``Who's he kidding?'' Dukakis asked supporters in Evergreen Park,
a suburb of Chicago. ``What are they going to do with the extra
money? Hire a second butler, a lifeguard for the pool?''
   Bush, spaking at a rally in Tacoma, Wash., said today, ``This
election is all about creating jobs and opportunity,'' and he said
his administration would be committed to keeping the economic
expansion going.
   Bush received the endorsement of the 50,000-member National
Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association at a rally where four
protesters were pulled from the hall and more than a hundred
demonstrators paraded outside.
   Campaigning on the West Coast, where environmental issues are
always important, Bush expressed gratitude to American and Soviet
teams who worked to free the two whales trapped by ice off the coast
of Alaska.
   ``Every once in a while something comes along that captivates the
American spirit, transcends politics, captivates the attention of
the world, as a matter of fact, and emphasizes the goodness of the
human race,'' he said.
   ``The fact that despite all of our problems we can still reach
out and help, it really did move me,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis, trailing in national public opinion polls, referred in
his remarks to Democratic President Harry Truman's 1948 comeback
victory. He was campaigning late in the day in Truman's home state
of Missouri, where a statewide poll indicated that Bush's late
August lead of nine points had dropped to one.
   ``Harry Truman was a fighter and so am I,'' Dukakis said. ``My
friends, this election is up for grabs.''
   President Reagan, meanwhile, was out seeking votes for his vice
president. In remarks prepared for a rally in Little Rock, Ark., he
noted that the Democrats have complained about negative GOP
campaigning, and he said, ``On Nov. 8, go into that polling booth
and do some negative campaigning of your own, the right kind of
negative campaigning: Say `no' to new taxes and `yes' to the
Republican ticket.''
   Wednesday night, Dukakis used a nationally broadcast town meeting
in Naperville, Ill., to dispute GOP allegations that he is soft on
crime, weak on defense, favors gun control and ignores environmental
problems.
   The vice president, campaigning in Detroit, Sioux Falls, S.D.,
and Billings, Mont., told voters Wednesday that the Democrats'
version of prosperity is higher interest rates, similar to the 21.5
percent rate near the end of the Carter administration.
   ``We don't need that kind of Democratic prosperity,'' Bush said.
``We need the kind that Ronald Reagan has brought to this country.''
   The latest national poll by ABC News-Washington Post showed Bush
holding an eight-point lead over Dukakis, a somewhat smaller
advantage than the double-digit margin the GOP nominee had in two
polls earlier this week.
   The survey of 1,242 likely voters put the contest at 52-44
percent, closer than the 13-point gap in a CBS News-New York Times
poll and the 14 points among likely voters in a Gallup poll released
Tuesday.
   The ABC-Post poll was conducted during the seven days ending
Tuesday, and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage
points.
   In hopes of turning the tide, Dukakis was continuing his series
of television appearances with an interview tonight on the ``CBS
Evening News.''
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, who
appeared on the program Wednesday night, said the Republicans had
run a ``miserable campaign'' of distortions which Dukakis did not
address until after it hurt the ticket.
   ``They started immediately after that Democratic convention, and
frankly I thought they should have been answered then,'' Bentsen
said. ``But my friend Mike Dukakis was incredulous, he just didn't
believe that sort of charges with the distortions could stick.
   ``But they have and they have hurt. And that's one of the reasons
we're in the kind of a race we're in now.''
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, campaigning in
Florida, dismissed the television appearances by the Democratic
ticket.
   ``Actually I think it's their swan song,'' he said. ``A nice way
for Michael Dukakis to say good-bye to America.''

<HEAD>Reports Offer Further Evidence of Slowdown in Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal incomes rose a moderate 0.5
percent in September while consumer spending turned in its weakest
performance in almost a year, the government said Thursday in
reports that offered fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing.
   The Commerce Department said personal consumption spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, was unchanged
in September following a 0.6 percent August rise.
   It was the first time spending had failed to advance since a 0.2
percent drop in October 1987. That decline had been blamed in part
on consumer anxiety from the record stock market plunge.
   When the rise in prices is taken into account, consumer spending
actually fell 0.5 percent last month, the department reported. The
0.5 percent rise in incomes was also completely erased by rising
inflation, it said.
   Analysts said the weakness in consumer spending and the modest
income advance in September showed that the economy is likely to
slow in coming months.
   ``Consumers are being more tight-fisted because their incomes are
going nowhere,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill
Lynch brokerage. ``They already have so much debt that they are
unwilling to borrow any more.''
   Steinberg predicted that consumer spending, which has been the
driving force behind the current economic expansion, would show only
modest gains over the coming year and that this would contribute to
an expected overall economic slowdown.
   The government reported Wednesday that the overall economy, as
measured by the gross national product, rose at an annual rate of
just 2.2 percent from July through September. It was the slowest
pace in almost two years and followed GNP growth of 3.2 percent in
the first half of 1988.
   Many economists believe this slowdown will continue over the next
year, with the biggest question being whether growth will become so
weak that it could topple the country into a recession.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, said she
believed consumer spending, while slowing, would remain strong
enough to support economic growth of about 2.5 percent.
   ``Consumer confidence remains reasonably strong. They are
spending at a rate equal to their income growth. It is just that
income growth has been weak,'' she said.
   Income rose $19.9 billion in September to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $4.1 trillion, before taking inflation into account,
the Commerce Department said. That 0.5 percent rise followed gains
of 0.3 percent in August and 0.7 percent in July.
   Personal income was held back by a $6.5 billion decrease in farm
income as the widespread summer drought cut output. Farm subsidy
payments were unchanged.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, were up
at an annual rate of $14.1 billion in September. That 0.6 percent
increase followed a lackluster 0.2 percent August gain.
   The weakness in personal consumption spending, which was stuck at
an annual rate of $3.26 trillion, reflected a $3.1 billion drop in
purchases of durable goods, such as autos and appliances.
   Purchases of services rose $3.4 billion, less than one-third of
the increase in August. Analysts said the services category, which
includes housing costs, had been inflated in previous months by
higher electricity bills because of the summer heat wave.
   Purchases of non-durable goods, items not expected to last three
years, showed a small increase of $400 million.
   Disposable, or after-tax incomes, rose by 0.5 percent in
September following a 0.3 percent August increase. Personal tax
payments in September, one of four payment months for taxpayers
filing quarterly returns, were up $3.6 billion after an increase of
$2 billion in August.
   With spending showing no growth while incomes were rising, the
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, climbed
to 4.2 percent last month, the highest level since May. The savings
rate was 3.8 percent in August.
   In another economic report, the Labor Department said the price
of imported goods fell by 1.1 percent from July through September,
the first such decline in more than two years.
   The price decrease reflected a drop in crude oil prices and the
fact that the dollar strengthened somewhat against foreign
currencies during the summer. A stronger dollar lowers the cost of
imported goods to Americans. However, economists say the dollar will
need to fall still further for the United States to make more
progress in reducing its huge trade deficit.
   The price of U.S. exports, which have been booming this year,
rose by 2 percent in the third quarter and are now 8.7 percent
higher than they were a year ago.

   Partial returns showed President Kenneth
Kaunda, the only candidate for the only legal party, winning more
than 90 percent of the vote in Zambia's election, officials said
Thursday.
   They said about two-thirds of the 2.6 million registered voters
participated in Wednesday's election for president and members of
the legislature, about the same as 1983.
   Kaunda, 64, led the British colony of Northern Rhodesia to
independence as Zambia on Oct. 24, 1964, and has been president
since, winning elections every five years as the sole candidate. He
declared a one-party state in 1972.
   His United National Independent Party put up 609 candidates for
125 seats in the National Assembly, with 11 competing in one
district.
   Voters were asked to vote for or against Kaunda.
   Presidential ballots carried the symbols of an eagle and a frog.
Voters chose the eagle if they were for Kaunda, a frog if they were
against him.
   Election officials said the vote for Kaunda was running above 90
percent with one-quarter of the votes counted. Official results are
not expected until Saturday.
   Wezi Kaunda, the president's son, was elected to the National
Assembly from Malambo in Eastern province with 5,849 votes, 4,514
more than his nearest rival.
   President Kaunda has avoided the civil disorder afflicting other
African countries. He remains popular with his 7 million people
despite serious economic problems caused by mismanagement,
corruption and a slump in the world price of copper, which provides
90 percent of Zambia's foreign exchange.
   Zambia is burdened by high inflation and unemployment, increasing
urban crime and a $5 billion foreign debt that absorbs 40 percent of
hard currency earnings.

   All major factions, ranging
from black activists to hardline white segregationists, claimed
success Thursday after the country's largest and most divisive
municipal elections.
   President P.W. Botha's National Party, although beaten by the
far-right Conservative Party in dozens of white towns, triumphed in
several major battlegrounds and claimed that a 33 percent turnout in
contested black wards was a rebuff to activists who had urged a
boycott.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of the leading boycott
proponents, said the government's claims were ``quite hilarious''
and noted that only a small fraction of blacks were eligible to
vote. He and other anti-apartheid leaders urged the government to
ignore white extremists and negotiate to give blacks full voting
rights in national affairs.
   ``Manipulate statistics whichever way you like,'' said Tutu.
``The reality remains that black South Africans reject apartheid and
government attempts to give it a coat of new paint.''
   The Conservative Party, campaigning for stricter enforcement of
apartheid laws, fell short of some of its own bold predictions. It
narrowly missed taking power in Pretoria, the adminisrative capital,
where it won 19 council seats to 22 for the Nationalists, and it was
beaten back in much of the range Free State, the most rural of the
four provinces.
   But the Conservatives swept to power in farming towns and small
cities of Transvaal, the most populous province, winning at least 67
municipalities to 30 for the National Party.
   The Nationalists for the first time gained outright control in
Johannesburg, the nation's largest city, and the Conservatives won
their first seats on the council.
   Both the Conservatives and the Nationalists said the overall
results boded well for their prospects in a general election,
expected to held by early 1990.
   Andries Treurnicht, the Conservative leader, said his party now
was in a stronger position to oppose government programs aimed at
desegregating business districts and channeling more tax revenue to
black areas.
   However, Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis said
the results would ``give greater momentum to the process of
constitutional reform'' aimed at giving black moderates a limited
role in central government.
   The Conservatives campaigned on many national issues over which
local councils have no jurisidiciton, such as residential
segregation laws. But municipal councils do have power to evict
squatters and segregate public amenities.
   Through representation on regional councils, city councils also
can influence how much of their tax money goes to help develop
nearby black townships.
   These were the first municipal elections contested nationmwide by
the Conservative Party, which was established in 1980 by
disenchanted Nationalists who felt the government was conceding too
much to blacks.
   The elections also were the first in which South Africans of all
races voted on the same day. There were 7,229 seats at stake, most
of them in white communities. Of the 1,839 seats available on black
councils, only 905 had more than one candidate.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. estimated the
black voter turnout at about one-third of those eligible. That would
amount to more than 400,000 black votes, compared with about 283,000
in the last black local elections in 1983, when a 21 percent turnout
was recorded.
   The black turnout ranged as high as 80 percent in some small
rural towns Wednesday, but was 11.5 percent in Soweto, the largest
black community, where about 28,000 of an estimated 1 million adults
cast ballots.
   In many townships, there were no candidates. In others, there
were allegations that some blacks were coerced into voting and-or
induced by promises that were unable to be fulfilled.
   ``I see they (the government) are claiming today that hundreds of
thousands have voted and that the people elected have a solid
mandate,'' Tutu said in a statement. ``How can there be a solid
mandate when half the seats for blacks were not even contested for
the lack of interest? How does a 10 or 12 percentage poll in Soweto
constitute a solid mandate?''
   Anti-apartheid activists, including many prominent clergymen,
said voting for separate local authorities was an entrenchment of
the system of racial segregation.
   The government banned most major black anti-apartheid groups in
February and outlawed calls for a vote boycott.
   In the white elections, anti-apartheid candidates kept control of
Durban, although right-wingers opposed to intergation of beaches won
three seats. The liberal Progressive Federal Party kept control of
Cape Town, the country's legislative capital, and won 18 of the 51
wards in Johannesburg.

   Authorities have arrested 13
Palestinians suspected of preparing a terrorist attack, a prosecutor
said today.
   Jochen Ruhland, chief prosecutor in Duesseldorf, said the
Palestinians were arrested in raids throughout the country Wednesday
and today.
   Hesse state radio in Frankfurt said they were believed to belong
to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Authorities previously said they were concerned about possible
terrorist attacks linked to the Frankfurt trial of confessed TWA
hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem.
   However, Ruhland told The Associated Press that no such
connection had been made.
   He said authorities still were trying to determine the precise
target of the planned terrorist strike.
   Arno Falk, spokesman for federal police headquarters in
Wiesbaden, confirmed the arrests but declined to give details.
   However, a source at the police headquarters, speaking to the AP
on the condition of anonymity, said authorities were looking for
more suspects.
   A Frankfurt judicial official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said authorities recently circulated warnings about plans
for an imminent strike by Palestinian terrorists in West Germany.
   Ruhland said police searched apartments and offices in West
Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Neuss, just outside Duesseldorf, and
seized explosives and detonators.
   Documents were also found, but he did not tell reporters what
they were.
   Hesse state radio said the Palestinians were seized in 16
apartments and businesses throughout West Germany.
   It said a 30-year-old man, whom it did not identify, was
suspected of being the ringleader and was also arrested.

   Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the 1988 Nobel
Prize for Literature, said Thursday he is not well enough to travel
to Stockholm in December to receive his $390,000 award.
   Mahfouz, who said his doctors advised him not to go, added that
it had not been decided whether anyone from his family would attend
the Dec. 10 ceremony.
   Egypt's ambassador to Stockholm, Abdel-Rahman Ahmed Marei, will
accept the prize in his name, he said in a telephone interview.
   Mahfouz, who will be 77 on Dec. 11, is writing the Nobel Lecture
for the ambassador to read, the Middle East News Agency said. It
traditionally is delivered the day after the ceremony.
   Mahfouz ranks among Egypt's most popular writers. His works cover
historical, social and, in his recent books and short stories,
metaphysical themes. Many of his works have been translated into
English, French, German and Swedish among other languages.

<HEAD>Report: Nearly 20 Percent of U.S. Children Lack Health Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 percent of children in the United
States have no health insurance, and youngsters in poor working
families are less likely be covered than are children of the
unemployed, a research group reported Thursday.
   The Employee Benefit Research Institute, in an analysis of data
collected by the Census Bureau, found that the higher rates of
coverage for children of the unemployed occurred because it was
easier for those families to qualify for Medicaid.
   ``Despite greater rates of employer coverage, poor children in
worker families are about 38 percent more likely than children in
poor, non-worker families to be uninsured,'' the institute said in
its report, ``Uninsured in the United States.''
   It said that among children in poor, single-parent families
headed by a full-time worker, 53.1 percent had no health insurance,
either public or private. Among poor, single-parent families headed
by an unemployed adult, 30.1 percent of children were not covered.
   Overall, the report found that 88 percent of the 37 million
Americans who were uninsured in 1986 either were workers themselves
or lived in families that included workers. Nearly 18 percent of the
civilian population under age 65 reported no health insurance from
any source.
   Deborah Chollet, the senior research associate who completed the
study, said that even among workers where family income was four
times or more of the poverty level, there were 5.2 million
individuals without health insurance.
   ``A surprising number of them have family incomes that are quite
high and that at least you would expect they would both value and
buy health insurance and they don't for some unknown reason,'' she
said.
   Ms. Chollet said some of these people may think they can't afford
health insurance but haven't thoroughly checked around for
affordable coverage. Some may be uninsurable because of certain
health problems, and others may not be educated about the need for
coverage.
   Ms. Chollet said both presidential candidates' health insurance
proposals still would leave millions of Americans uninsured, but
that Democrat Michael Dukakis' plan would cover far more than
George's Bush's.
   Dukakis' proposal to expand employer-provided health insurance
could extend coverage to 23 million uninsured individuals at a cost
of $22 billion to employers and $5 billion to workers, she said.
   Bush's proposal, still sketchy, would allow more low-income
people to ``buy in'' to the Medicaid program, but his plan to spend
$400 million in the first year and $200 million thereafter is
inadequate to bring in very many people, Ms. Chollet said.
   The institute is a non-partisan research organization.

<TEXT>
   An auctioneer examining a collection of
papers in preparation for an estate sale found ``the absolute dream
of every autograph collector'' _ a letter written by George
Washington.
   The one-page letter, dated Dec. 10, 1796, was addressed to a
Richard Peters and concerned a suggestion Peters had made about
agricultural policy.
   ``I haven't slept a lot since Saturday night,'' Phil Riner said
about his discovery, made when he examined documents in the estate
of an ailing Lakeland resident, whose hobby was collecting
historical documents.
   The family of the collector, whom Riner refused to identify, had
asked Riner to inventory items for an estate sale.
   Some documents written by Washington have recently brought as
much as $19,000, Riner said Wednesday. They vary in value depending
on their importance and when they were written. Washington's
autograph has brought $3,000, he said.
   The brief letter to Peters referred to documents Washington was
enclosing with a suggestion that they might be of interest to
congressional committees. Peters' address was not listed, and Riner
did not disclose the text of the letter.
   ``I have not had a chance to do any research on it, but I would
assume it had something to do with congressional business,'' Riner
said. The letter was written about three months before Washington's
second term ended.
   Riner, who heads Phil Riner Auctions, Jewelry, and Estate
Liquidators in nearby Winter Haven, said the auction for the letter,
probably within 60 days, would be widely advertised.
   ``I will, of course, have it thoroughly authenticated
beforehand,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A Minnesota law banning exit polls, used to
project election winners, within 100 feet of a polling place
violates free speech, a lawyer for the three major television
networks argued Thursday.
   The networks are seeking a court order blocking the law through
the Nov. 8 election. U.S. District Judge David S. Doty took the
request under advisement and said he would rule before Election Day.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York attorney representing CBS, ABC and NBC,
told Doty the 1984 law would prevent family members from asking each
other how they voted if they were within the zoned area.
   ``Here is an amendment, on its face, which makes it illegal for
my daughter to ask me how I voted,'' he said.
   Peter Ackerberg, a special assistant state attorney general,
noted that the state has imposed other restrictions on activities
near the polling place, such as distributing political literature.
   ``Voters should not be required to run a gauntlet of
questioners,'' Ackerberg said. ``They should be allowed to walk away
in peace from this sanctified place.''
   He added: ``Election Day is not an event staged for the media.''
   Exit polling became controversial in 1980 when it became clear
after polls closed in the East that Ronald Reagan would defeat
President Jimmy Carter by a landslide. Many Westerners were still
voting when the networks declared Reagan the winner.
   The three major networks say this year they will project winners
of the presidential race state-by-state as polls close, but will
refrain from declaring a winner overall until after voters on the
West Coast cast their ballots.
   Abrams said the networks have successfully fought similar exit
polling restrictions in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Montana,
Washington and Wyoming. He said Minnesota is the last state where
such a law is being challenged.
   Abrams said the state has a legitimate interest in passing laws
to alleviate congestion around polling places. ``But this is a
blunderbuss way of dealing with that problem,'' he said.
   The intent of the law, he argued, is to prevent the networks from
conducting exit polls.
   ``What they (legislators) were after is speech they didn't like,
and that's simply off-limits to them,'' he said.
   Abrams said the law prevents anyone from approaching a voter
within 50 feet of a polling place and prevents the voter from being
asked how he or she voted within 50 feet to 100 feet of the polling
place.
   ``There's no evidence one could do exit polling that works at
that distance,'' he said.

   Two Marine Corps helicopters probably
collided before each crashed, killing nine Marines and one Air Force
officer while on a desert training mission, Marine officials said
today.
   ``We feel confident enough to say a midair collision was more
than likely,'' said Gunnery Sgt. Hal Wheeler, a spokesman at the
Marine Corps Air Station at Yuma.
   Wheeler said the two helicopters that crashed Tuesday night _ a
Boeing CH-46 and a Bell UH-1N _ flew from the Yuma base but neither
were actually stationed there. The CH-46 was from the Marine Corps
Air Station in New River, N.C., and the UH-1N was from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., he said.
   Wheeler also said that, though spokesmen initially said four men
were aboard the CH-46 and six aboard the UH-1N, there was
uncertainty about the actual distribution of the men between the two
aircraft.
   The crash site about 16 miles southeast of here, on the Goldwater
Air Force Range, was in an area so rough that four-wheel-drive
vehicles had trouble reaching it, said 1st Lt. Mary Baldwin, public
affairs officer at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma.
   The last body was not recovered until late Wednesday afternoon,
said Baldwin.
   The men were participating in the final training exercise of a
weapons-and-tactics instructors' training course taught twice a year
at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, 125 miles southwest of the
crash site.
   The course is an advanced program in battle tactics, including
moving personnel from place to place, rescuing wounded and
countering enemy weapons and aircraft.
   The crash was the second in the course's history. In 1984, two
Marines were killed when their light observation plane crashed on
the range.
   The twin-rotor CH-46 Sea Knight, which Boeing stopped building in
1971, is the Marine's main assault helicopter. Three Marines were
killed in May when a CH-46 crashed during a test flight from Kaneohe
Marine Corps Air Station in Hawaii.
   A Marine CH-46 carrying 21 men crashed in 1986, killing eight
during a NATO exercise off Norway. In one of the worst crashes
involving the helicopter, 14 Marines and a Navy chaplain were killed
in 1985 when a CH-46 crashed into the Atlantic off North Carolina.
   On Monday, a UH-1H helicopter hit a power line and crashed near
the U.S.-Mexico border in California, killing five lawmen and three
National Guardsmen during the first mission of a joint anti-drug
smuggling program.
   The identify of one Marine killed Tuesday was being withheld
pending notification of next of kin.
   But the Marine Corp Air Station in Yuma identified the others as
Maj. William C. Walker III, 35, of Clinton, Mo.; Capt. Steven T.
Andrews, 36, of Cincinnati; Capt. Herbert L. Heyl Jr., 33, of
Middlesex, N.J.; Cpl. Henry J. Horvath, 24, of Beallsville, Ohio;
Capt. Kenneth L. Royal, 28, of Chattanooga, Tenn.; Cpl. Alan J.
O'Neil, 20, Fort Atkinson, Wis.; Capt. William A. Stuver, 34, of
Chicago; and Cpl. Donald L. Waid, no age or hometown available,
stationed at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
   Also killed was Air Force Capt. Timothy J. Kitt, no age or
hometown available, a helicopter instructor stationed at Luke Air
Force Base west of Phoenix.

   Graying veterans of Harry Truman's 1948
presidential campaign celebrated anew the triumph the experts said
was impossible, but offered scant hope to Democrats looking for a
repeat in 1988.
   They were wild about Harry all over again at Wednesday night's
reunion at the National Press Club, where they gathered to watch a
public television documentary on ``The Great Upset of '48.''
   The show will air nationally Tuesday night.
   Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, was so confident of
victory and so far ahead in the polls he didn't begin campaigning
until Sept. 19. He skirted issues, prompting reporters to speculate
that his middle initial stood for ``Elusive.''
   Dewey's confidence was such that he ``had been negotiating the
purchase of a suit to be inaugurated in,'' recalled author Robert J.
Donovan, who covered the race for the New York Herald Tribune.
   Truman, the onetime haberdasher from Missouri, had inherited the
Oval Office when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945, but the
Democratic Party was splintered, with Henry Wallace running on
Truman's left and Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond, then governor of South
Carolina, on his right.
   The incumbent's campaign got off to a hapless start, with Truman
addressing a half-empty hall in Omaha, Neb., dedicating an airport
in Idaho to the wrong person and pronouncing Josef Stalin ``a decent
fellow'' in Oregon.
   But Truman also relentlessly pummeled the ``do-nothing''
Republican Congress, vetoed the Taft-Hartley bill to shore up labor
support, appealed to farmers and stood fast for civil rights.
   Truman picked up an endorsement from a movie actor named Ronald
Reagan, president of the Screen Actors Guild, who said in a radio ad
he was ``more than a little impatient with those promises the
Republicans made before they got control of Congress a couple of
years ago.''
   So daunting was Dewey's lead that the Roper organization did not
bother to survey after early September.
   ``The polls were completely wrong,'' said Eric Sevareid, then a
CBS Radio reporter, who recalls the big crowds that turned out as
Truman's train, the Ferdinand Magellan, covered 31,000 miles across
America.
   ``We began to think, `Something is going on here,' but none of us
had enough guts to go bet even at 9-1,'' said Sevareid.
   Clark Clifford, Truman's counsel, recalled that if someone didn't
spontaneously shout ``Give 'em hell, Harry'' in the first minute of
Truman's speeches, the campaign staff would dispatch someone to do
the job.
   ``It was called priming the pump,'' said Clifford.
   After the severe-looking Dewey was ridiculed by tart-tongued
Alice Roosevelt Longworth as ``the little man on the wedding cake,''
campaign manager Herbert Brownell urged the New York governor to
shave off his mustache.
   But Mrs. Dewey said no. ``She thought that was trimming his sails
for political purposes,'' Brownell told the documentary-makers.
   Newsweek magazine canvassed 50 top political writers, and every
one picked Dewey. Truman laughed it off, saying he knew all 50 and
``not one of them has enough sense to pound sand in a rat hole.''
   On election night, Nov. 2, 1948, legendary NBC Radio announcer
H.V. Kaltenborn assured Americans that despite an early lead for
Truman, Dewey would prevail ``when the outlying districts are
reported.''
   When editors at the Chicago Tribune heard that broadcast, they
ordered the presses to roll with the headline, ``DEWEY DEFEATS
TRUMAN'' _ and created a collector's item that Truman held up in
jubilation the next day after his 2 million-vote victory.
   Is there a lesson in all this for the 1988 race, when most polls
now point to a big lead for George Bush over Michael Dukakis?
   If Truman were alive, ``he'd be giving hell to both candidates
for waging one of the sorriest campaigns of this century,'' said
Paul Duke, the narrator of the documentary and host of public
television's ``Washington Week in Review.''
   Donovan observed, ``The trouble from Dukakis' point of view is
that Bush knows the Dewey story, too. A lot of people have learned a
big lesson from Tom Dewey. George Bush is one of them.''

<HEAD>Medicare Payment Changes Need More Study Says JAMA Editorial</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Release 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposed changes in the way Medicare payments to
physicians are calculated should be studied carefully before they
are put into practice, say editorials in the latest Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The recommendations, made last month, would sharply increase the
amount of money physicians are paid for office visits and reduce
fees for surgery and other procedures, such as installing pacemakers.
   The plan developed by economist William Hsiao at the Harvard
University School of Public Health needs to be reviewed by the
medical profession, Dr. James Todd wrote in an editorial appearing
in Friday's JAMA.
   ``There must be external review and validation of the study's
credibility, reliability and validity,'' Todd wrote. ``No less
important will be the consideration of whether and how this academic
research should be translated into the cold, hard realities of
Medicare policy.''
   The proposal is ``certain to stir controversy among physicians''
and should be examined further, Dr. Philip Lee, chairman of the
Physician Payment Review Commission and Paul Ginsburg, the panel's
executive director, wrote in a second editorial.
   The Washington-based organization was created by Congress in 1986
to advise it on reforms in Medicare's methods of paying physicians.
It commissioned the Harvard study.
   Todd said the American Medical Association would ``work closely
with specialty societies and state medical associations'' to
evaluate the Harvard proposal.
   The plan places a non-monetary value on tasks doctors perform.
For example, a comprehensive visit by a new patient to a general
practitioner is 248, while a well-baby visit is 64 and a triple
coronary bypass is 2,871.
   The value would be multiplied by a monetary conversion figure,
determined by Congress for Medicare, or by insurance companies, to
figure out how much doctors should be paid.
   Under current Medicare policies, physicians are paid less for
day-to-day management of their patients than they are for exotic
tests and other procedures. The new proposal would not penalize
doctors for spending time with patients.
   Todd said the values were based on averages and ``cannot
recognize differences among physicians in patient mix, quality or
practice costs.
   ``A properly working ... fee schedule will require the
flexibility that comes with physicians' ability to determine their
own charges using (the value scale) as a foundation,'' he wrote.
   Lee and Ginsburg said the proposal should not be the only
criteria in determining new fee schedules for doctors. ``Other
components should include geographic multipliers that determine how
payments would vary from one locality to another,'' they wrote.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has begun recalling nearly
750,000 1984-model cars and trucks bearing Chevrolet, Pontiac and
GMC nameplates to replace a defective switch in the pollution
control system, the Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday.
   The action brings to 2.4 million the number of GM cars and trucks
from the 1982, 1983 and 1984 model years recalled to install new
thermal vacuum switches, which control emissions during warmup. A
defective switch can cause excessive emissions of carbon monoxide
and unburned gasoline.
   Models affected are the Chevrolet Impala, Caprice Classic,
Camaro, Monte Carlo and El Camino; the Pontiac Firebird, Bonneville,
Grand Prix and Parisienne and the GMC Caballero. They are equipped
with 3.8-liter (231 cubic inches) six-cylinder and 5.0-liter (305
cubic inches) and 5.7-liter (350 cubic inches) V-8 engines.
   Of the 749,802 vehicles being recalled, 53,114 were sold in
California, which has separate standards from the rest of the
country and sometimes is not affected by recalls.
   Recall letters ask owners to schedule appointments with dealers
for free replacements, EPA said.

<HEAD>Students Ask for AIDS Test</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Students at a school for the deaf asked to
be tested for the AIDS virus after learning that a former school
worker had contracted the virus and that there may have been sexual
activity between staff and students.
   The Mississippi School for the Deaf will ask parents of students
age 12 and over if they want the state Health Department to test
their children for exposure to the virus that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Superintendent Alma Alexander said Wednesday that she had called
a meeting of students after hearing that most had learned of a
possible problem from news reports the day before.
   ``Some of them asked if they could be tested,'' Alexander said,
``so I asked what their feeling was, if I could have a show of hands
on who would like to be tested, and almost all of them raised their
hands.''
   Dr. Ed Thompson, state epidemiologist, said the youths would be
tested ``as soon as they have the parents' permission for it.''
Results probably would come a few weeks later.
   The state had received information earlier that a former employee
had contracted the AIDS virus and that there had been sexual
activity between staff members and students.
   The first allegation was verified, Thompson said. While there was
no hard evidence of sexual misconduct, he said, there was sufficient
evidence to warrant testing.
   About half of the school's 160 students are 12 and older.
   Alexander said the former employee left the school in the summer.
She said she is confident the employee who resigned had not had
sexual relations with anyone on campus.

   Vice President George Bush has had all
sorts of trouble with dreaded ``W'' words.
   First, critics said the Republican presidential nominee was too
wealthy. Then they said he was a wimp. Now, third-graders at a
Springfield elementary school say his writing is ``weird.''
   Judy McCune's class at Rountree Elementary School say Bush holds
his pen the wrong way and sent him a letter Wednesday to help him
fix the problem.
   The letter read in part:
   ``We are learning cursive writing. We are trying to hold our
pencils right. ... We saw you holding your pencil wrong on TV during
the debate. ... We hope you can break your bad habit.''
   The class also sent Bush a diagram showing left-handed writers
the correct position of the hand and how to place paper at the
proper angle.
   Levi Dreier, the only left-hander in the class, said he would
tell Bush that his writing is sloppy. ``I'd tell him to try harder,
not to hold your pencil weird,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Gets Assurances On Sales To Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany has promised the United States
that it will reject domestic pressures and prevent the sale of
militarily sensitive technology to the Soviet Union, U.S. officials
said Thursday.
   The assurances were made last week in Bonn in advance of this
week's trip to Moscow by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and a group of 30
businessmen who have signed deals estimated at over $1 billion, said
an official.
   The West Germans consulted with the United States about the deals
they intended to sign, ``and we could see they were being very
careful,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   At the same time, the United States has warned West Germany and
other allies in the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls, or COCOM, against being lulled into a false sense of
security by recent Soviet reforms, the official said. COCOM
determines which technologies members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and Japan can sell to the Soviet bloc.
   ``We have received assurances from (West Germany) that it will
observe established COCOM procedures when it comes to carrying out
the various commercial agreements reached by German firms in
Moscow,'' said State Department spokesman Charles Redman.
   The West German assurances were given last week to Ambassador
Allan Wendt, the State Department's specialist on export controls,
who held talks in Bonn, Paris, Rome and London as part of regularly
scheduled consultations on COCOM.
   The Paris-based organization has been seeking to streamline its
complex list of banned technologies in response to the economic
liberalization of several Soviet bloc countries.
   The next full round of consultations on the changes is not
expected until next spring, when the new U.S. administration is in
place.
   ``We and our allies sometimes can and do differ on specifics or
exactly what needs to be done ... to ensure that we have strong
barriers around critical technologies,'' Redman said.
   ``As allies, we settle these differences on an ongoing basis
within COCOM,'' he added.
   But the other official said ``some people'' within COCOM have
been urging a wholesale lifting of controls on exports to the Soviet
bloc. He declined to name names but indicated that West German
officials were among those to whom he referred.
   ``There are domestic political pressures in some countries to
relax COCOM restrictions,'' this official said. ``If you are living
across the border from East Germany, for example, the temptation to
believe the Soviet threat is over is great.''
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has been
advocating greater trade with Moscow as a way of stimulating the
stagnant economy and creating jobs.
   But Wendt made it clear to the allies that ``the Soviet threat
has to change before COCOM can relax its rules,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Teen-aged Murder Convict Wins Appeal On Confession</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An appeals court has ordered a new
trial for a girl sentenced to life at age 15 for the murder of her
grandfather, ruling that evidence should have been allowed
undermining a confession she later recanted.
   It noted, for example, that she had used drugs for 12 years.
   The 4th District Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned the 1986
murder conviction of Cara McIntosh of Pompano Beach, now 17, who is
serving a life sentence with a mandatory minimum of 25 years.
   ``When I called her at the prison she just cried, she was so
happy,'' said her attorney, Keith Krasnove. ``She's been waiting for
so long to hear some good news, and I think she was starting to
think we'd lost.''
   Cara, her mother Paulette, and one of her mother's friends, Dean
Dameron, were convicted of murder in the death of Paulette's father,
Emmett Richardson. His body was found in a canal May 30, 1986. All
three were sentenced to life in prison.
   In a confession she later recanted, Cara told police that she was
present during the crime and had held a sock to her grandfather's
mouth while others tied and gagged him while stealing money for
drugs from his business.
   ``The jury believed the tape and didn't believe what she said on
the stand,'' said prosecuting attorney Jack Coyle.
   The appellate ruling said the trial court should have allowed
testimony about Paulette McIntosh's psychological grip over her
daughter and about Cara's drug addiction.
   Cara was introduced to marijuana at the age of 3{ by her parents,
the News and Sun-Sentinel reported Thursday.
   ``Testimony regarding (Cara's) mother's control and domination
over (Cara) was a circumstance surrounding (Cara's) confession
because her mother was being interrogated in a nearby police room
and had told (Cara) to go along with whatever she said,'' the appeal
court opinion said.
   ``During (Cara's) interrogation, the police told her that her
mother had said certain things and that if she agreed with them, she
could go home.''
   The opinion also said she was ``coming down from a high'' at the
time of the confession.
   The state has two weeks to file a motion for a rehearing, or it
could proceed with a new trial.

<HEAD>Top Official Sees East European Integration with the West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is trying to encourage
political liberalization in Eastern Europe by holding out the
prospect of the eventual full integration of these countries into
the Western economic system.
   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, who returned recently
from a visit to the six Soviet allies in that region, said the
United States would be prepared to ``welcome these countries into
the Western world,'' provided they continue on their reformist path.
   In an interview Wednesday, Whitehead outlined his impressions of
his 11-day trip, which took him to Poland, Hungary, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.
   With the exception of Romania, Whitehead said, ``there is
dramatic change going on in Eastern Europe'' resulting from public
dissatisfaction with stagnant or declining economies. He said Poland
and Hungary are at the forefront of change, Romania is lagging
behind and Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East Germany are ``somewhere
in between.''
   Whitehead said he expects the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military
alliance to remain in tact but added there is a strong desire for
the departure of Soviet troops in the four countries where they are
stationed.
   There are an estimated 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany,
80,000 in Czechoslovakia, 65,000 in Hungary and 40,000 in Poland.
   ``I think the countries are becoming more independent of the
Soviet Union,'' Whitehead said. ``They are beginning to return to
their historical position where they were independent countries,
part of Europe, associated with the West economically, politically.
And I believe they are beginning to return to historically their
more normal position.''
   As the liberalization process continues, Whitehead said he
envisions greater East European participation in the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund, two pillars of the Western economic
system.
   He also foresees increased U.S. government involvement in
encouraging trade with and private investment in Eastern Europe.
   Whitehead has made six trips to Eastern Europe in his role as
Secretary of State George P. Shultz's principal liaison with
countries in the area. Part of his assignment is to encourage the
changes now taking place.
   The administration has felt that with the ambitious political and
economic reform movement in the Soviet Union under President Mikhail
Gorbachev, change was inevitable in Eastern Europe and officials
have been monitoring developments there far more closely than before.
   Whitehead said he does not foresee popular uprisings taking place
in Eastern Europe.
   But Zbigniew Brzezinski, a Polish-born former White House
national security adviser, wrote recently that several countries in
Eastern Europe are ``potentially ripe for revolutionary explosion.''
   ``It is not an exaggeration to say this could happen in more than
one at the same time,'' Brzezinski said.
   A major exception to the reform movement now under way is Romania
where, Whitehead said, an ``absolutely outrageous'' human rights
situation exists as a result of a government plan to demolish up to
7,000 villages under an agricultural modernization project.
   He said the people in these villages are being moved to
``cement-block, barracks-like structures'' with no running water and
no toilets.
   ``You can imagine living in an apartment house with no toilets.
It's pretty atrocious,'' Whitehead said.
   He called the forced resettlement policy ``an atrocious violation
of human rights that I have never seen before anywhere in the world
_ a government destroying the homes of its citizens and forcing them
to move into what look like military barracks.''

<TEXT>
   Palestinians buried the 19 people killed in
Israel's most destructive air raid of the year and subsequent ground
fighting, then fled Thursday as Israeli warplanes streaked low
overhead but did not attack.
   The dead were taken by small funeral processions to the main
cemetery of this ancient southern port and a Palestinian graveyard
in the nearby village of Darb el-Seem after Moslem noon prayers.
   Sirens wailed as mourners started home to the Mieh Mieh refugee
camp, target of the air raid. Guerrillas and civilians scattered,
ducking for cover as two jets flashed past.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization originally planned mass
funerals for the 15 people killed at Mieh Mieh, on Sidon's southern
fringe, and four guerrillas killed in fighting east of the city with
militia allies of Israel.
   A guerrilla officer, who would not give his name, said plans were
changed because ``we just couldn't risk mass gatherings. With
Israel's appetite for attacking at its peak, we figured it's prudent
to keep a low profile.''
   In Washington, the State Department urged all parties to hold
their fire.
   Those involved ``must keep in mind that the pattern of action and
reaction and the continuing violence in Lebanon has a negative
impact which serves the interests of no one,'' spokesman Charles
Redman said. ``Restraint would serve the interests of all and
contribute to security and stability.''
   Wednesday's rocket attack destroyed 30 buildings of a guerrilla
base in Mieh Mieh. Police said rescuers searched the rubble all
night and dug out nine bodies.
   They said the bodies were of three guerrillas and a family of six
_ parents and four children, two sons and two daughters aged 6 to
15. Six people were reported killed and 40 wounded immediately after
the raid on the base, which belonged to the Fatah guerrilla group
led by PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
   Fighting began in hills east of Sidon soon afterward. The South
Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militia that acts as
Israel's surrogate, attacked positions held by Palestinians and
leftist Lebanese militiamen for the first time since 1985.
   A statement by the militia said its fighters captured a strategic
hill overlooking Jezzine, the largest Christian town in south
Lebanon, and killed four guerrillas of the Fatah-Revolutionary
Council faction led by terrorist Abu Nidal.
   It acknowledged one militiaman killed and one wounded and said
the attackers captured three followers of Abu Nidal, whose real name
is Sabry al-Banna.
   Palestinian sources at Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp
confirmed the losses and said Abu Nidal's commander east of Sidon,
known by the code name Abu Rabie, was among the dead.
   Guerrillas had used the outpost to to harass Jezzine, 11 miles
west of Sidon, with mortar and sniper fire.
   Only one of the 19 Israeli air raids into Lebanon this year
killed more people than the strike at Mieh Mieh. The first attack,
Jan. 3, took 26 lives and wounded 30 people at a guerrilla base
north of Sidon.
   Both police and PLO spokesmen said Wednesday's raid was the worst
in terms of destruction and guerrilla casualties.
   ``Mieh Mieh has suffered the most severe destruction since
Israel's 1982 invasion'' of Lebanon, said a police spokesman in
Sidon, whose name cannot be used because of regulations.
   The air raid on the refugee camp, and a later strike Wednesday at
a guerrilla base outside Beirut, were the third and fourth since a
Shiite Moslem driver detonated a car bomb last week in an army
convoy in the ``security zone'' Israel maintains just north of the
border.
   Eight israeli soldiers were killed, and seven soldiers and two
local women wounded.
   Israeli fighter-bombers struck Palestinian and Shiite guerrilla
bases Friday and Sunday, killing 21 people and wounding 34.
   On Tuesday, Israeli troops and their militia allies foiled two
attempts by Palestinian guerrillas to infiltrate northern Israel.

<TEXT>
   Two whales that held the world's attention
for weeks swam away from their icy trap but remained today in a
slushy channel cleared by Soviet icebreakers, the Coast Guard said.
Rescuers still hoped the leviathans would follow the ships out into
open sea.
   ``You break a path and it's like a Sno-Cone behind you, it
freezes overnight. ...,'' said Ray Massey, a Coast Guard spokesman
in Alameda, Calif. ``They're probably going from hole to hole in
small pools behind the icebreaker.''
   After dawn broke this morning, helicopter crews headed out in
hopes of better determining the status of the two California gray
whales, whom scientists had dubbed Crossbeak and Bonnet. ``We're
going to have to do a nose count,'' said Sgt. Ian Robertson of the
Alaska National Guard. He said at least two helicopters were being
sent up.
   Massey's Coast Guard post was receiving messages from a U.S.
guardsman assigned as liaison aboard one of the two Soviet
icebreakers that continued to clear the way for the whales the day
after the breakthrough that got the whales out of their solid-ice
trap.
   ``It's in nature's hands now,'' Gary Hufford, a National Weather
Service ice analyst, had said earlier.
   The whales swam Wednesday on what was hoped would be a long
journey to their winter home off Baja California. But officials said
there were still some ways from the open sea, in the path cleared by
the icebreakers earlier and already partially refrozen.
   ``My understanding is that the whales were still in the channels
and that they (icebreakers) were going to have to do more cutting,''
Massey said.
   ``They're going to open a path to real open water and hope they
follow them out. ... If we just walked off and left them now, I
don't think they could get out on their own. If the breakers go out,
then they should be able to follow to go to open water.''
   The fate of the whales may never be known. Scientists involved in
the rescue that cost more than $800,000 didn't attach radio
transmitters to the whales, in part because of concern that the
devices would only add to the animals' stress, said federal marine
mammal biologist Jim Harvey.
   A whale that was trapped with the pair nearly three weeks ago
apparently died last week.
   But a major factor in the decision against the transmitters was
that ``a lot of people really didn't want to know'' the surviving
whales' fate, Harvey said.
   In a final frenzy Wednesday, Eskimos using chain saws cut 50 new
breathing holes into the ice, nearly as many as they had cut in two
weeks. The whales, which grew accustomed to the cutting, repeatedly
surfaced in the new holes before the last block of ice was removed.
   The animals moved to less than half a mile from a channel carved
through the 18-inch-thick ice by two Soviet icebreakers late Tuesday
and early Wednesday. Then, the Eskimos were ordered to retreat so
the icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev could reopen the channel, already
partially refrozen.
   Scrambling to safety on Nuvuagluak Spit, the rescuers were joined
by a press corps that nearly outnumbered them.
   After two hours and no movement by the icebreaker, the Eskimos
grew impatient. Their years of experience with the Arctic Ocean told
them that a rising wind could begin stacking up the ice and undo all
the progress.
   Faced with a near revolt, rescue coordinators allowed the natives
back onto the ice, and they quickly moved the whales to within
one-quarter mile of the channel the Soviets had cut Tuesday.
   Finally, the icebreaker appeared out of the snowy squall line
ahead.
   Just after 4 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT), rescue coordinator Ron Morris
reported from his helicopter that the whales had surfaced in a small
pool in the old channel.
   One was bleeding enough to stain the ice and surrounding water.
   They then slipped beneath the surface. Moments later, the whales
appeared about 25 feet away in open water left by the icebreaker.
   The crowd cheered.
   As darkness fell, the whales were moving along the channel, which
the Arseniev continued to clear, at least two miles from any
significant open water.
   ``They're in the main lead, and I can't help but think they'll
keep on truckin','' Morris said. ``I don't know how much more we can
do.''
   ``I learned a lot,'' said Craig George, a North Slope Borough
wildlife biologist who babysat for the whales from the time they
were found trapped. ``I learned that with persistence, clear
thinking and proper chain saws, you can do anything.''
   The rescue effort initially bogged down with an attempt to move a
185-ton ice-breaking barge from the Prudhoe Bay oil field 200 miles
away. The barge progressed just six miles in about as many days.
   The Alaska National Guard then donated a huge helicopter that
dropped a 5-ton concrete cylinder through the ice. But it proved to
be of little value.
   A $600,000 device known as an Archimedes screw tractor, mounted
on auger-driven pontoons, was loaned by the oil industry, but a test
run showed the slushy trail it left made it unsuitable.
   The rescue finally came down to a few dozen Eskimos working from
dawn until dark cutting holes to keep the whales alive and the
Soviet icebreakers, whose help was solicited last weekend.
   The endangered California gray whales have one of the longest
migration routes of all mammals, 6,000 to 8,000 miles from the
Arctic to the warm water off Baja California.
   Their population has risen to about 20,000, growing at an annual
average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, officials said.
   ``The human persistence and determination by so many individuals
on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the
environment,'' President Reagan said from the White House. ``It has
been an inspiring endeavor.''
   Precise figures on the cost of the rescue effort weren't
available, but an estimate of at least $800,000 was compiled from
estimates of a variety of governmental and private agencies and
businesses that took part. Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen of the federal
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said this morning on
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that the cost to the federal
government was relatively small.

   Denouncing what it called ``one of the great
scandals of American conservation,'' the Wilderness Society on
Thursday chose 10 national wildlife refuges as most endangered to
spotlight threats to the refuge system.
   ``These 10 refuges are just the tip of the iceberg,'' said George
Frampton, president of the society. ``From Florida to Alaska the
refuge system is threatened by poisonous agricultural runoff
containing heavy metals, toxic chemicals and pesticides; by wetlands
drainage and water diversion; by overcrowding and off-road vehicles;
by oil drilling and other incompatible activities.''
   A report from the society describing the 10 said, ``Without
prompt action, some of them may die.''
   In no particular order, these are the 10 most threatened:
National Key Deer in the western Florida Keys; Loxahatchee in
Florida's Everglades swamp; Stillwater near Reno, Nev.; Chincoteague
on the Virginia coast; Yazoo in Mississippi; Arctic on Alaska's
North Slope; Lower Rio Grande, Texas; Kesterson in California's San
Joaquin Valley; Upper Mississippi River along the Wisconsin, Iowa,
Minnesota and Illinois shores of the river; and Great Swamp in New
Jersey, 25 miles from Manhattan.
   Kesterson is so contaminated by irrigation runoff that many ducks
stopping there are killed, and most of the staff's time is spent
trying to keep waterfowl from landing. The society described the
refuge as ``in a coma.''
   Frampton said the 445 refuges managed by the Fish and Wildlife
Service have taken a back seat to the national parks, which have
major legislation spelling out protections, a huge supporting
constituency derived from 300 million annual visitors and a history
of being carved out of the wilderness decades ago.
   ``By contrast, many of our refuges are mere remnants _ designated
during development projects as a sop to environmentalists to protect
the few remaining fragments of habitat within a much greater area
destroyed,'' Frampton said.
   The society called on Congress to spell out goals and philosophy
of the system, something no statute now does, to appropriate more
money for land purchase and for the service to use more of its funds
for protection and less for bureaucratic overhead.
   Also, the service must do more to protect water quality, and
should renegotiate agreements with landowners, often other federal
or state agencies, ``so that refuge managers have more control over
the quality of the habitat. ... In many cases, the best solution is
probably to transfer title to the Fish and Wildlife Service.''
   ``All of these threats are man-caused,'' Frampton said. ``Almost
all of them could be mitigated or controlled by intelligent
management.''
   Frank Dunkle, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said in
a statement: ``The situations cited by the Wilderness Society are
not new, nor are they being ignored. The society seems to think we
can build a moat around each of our 445 refuges to protect them from
pollution and other external threats. Unfortunately, that just is
not possible.
   ``I wish, however, the society had given us and the Congress more
credit for what we are doing to combat the problems identified in
the report.''
   The society said these refuges didn't make the top 10 but had
serious problems anyway: Fallon, Nevada; Bowdoin, Montana; Hakalau
Forest, Hawaii; Upper Souris and J. Clark Salyer, North Dakota;
Ouray, Wyoming; Kenai, Alaska; and Tule Lake, California.

   Here are the choices of the Wilderness Society
for the nation's 10 most threatened wildlife refuges, some problems
listed by the society at each and some of the society's
recommendations.
   There is no significance to the order of listing.
   _National Key Deer, Florida.
   As many as 20 percent of the deer are killed by cars each year,
with more mauled by pet dogs of residents and visitors. Construction
``continues to gobble up lands vital to a healthy deer population.''
Domestic waste is polluting refuge waters.
   Additional land must be bought.
   _Loxahatchee, Florida.
   Nearby development has made water flow patterns much more
variable, and heavy fertilizer use is contaminating the refuge. A
solid waste disposal plant has been proposed on adjacent land.
   Water flow and quality should be improved and the waste plant
abandoned.
   _Stillwater, Nevada.
   It ``has become the dumping ground for arsenic, boron, selenium,
lithium and other toxins that are in the pesticide-laden runoff and
return flows'' from a nearby irrigation project.
   Water flow must be increased, possibly through ``purchase of
water rights from farmers, several of whom are willing to sell
them.''
   _Chincoteague, Virginia.
   A million visitors a year are putting pressure on wildlife
nesting.
   An off-road vehicle ban last summer was ``a dramatic success'' in
helping restore the endangered piping plover and should be
continued. Land acquisition should be stepped up and auto traffic
reduced.
   _Yazoo, Mississippi.
   Agricultural runoff is bringing in heavy concentrations of
pesticides and there is ``significant doubt'' that a segment of
drainage projects by the Army Corps of Engineers will be able to
ease runoff and siltation damage as claimed.
   The drainage projects should be stopped.
   _Arctic, Alaska.
   Oil companies and the Interior Department want to explore for
oil, which Congress has not permitted.
   Congress should make it a wilderness area where all development
is banned.
   _Lower Rio Grande, Texas.
   Nearby pesticide spraying and runoff, waste water discharges and
planned real estate development are the major threats.
   Land acquisition must be accelerated since only a fifth of what
was planned has been incorporated into the refuge.
   _Kesterson, California.
   ``In a coma'' because of selenium poisoning from irrigation
runoff that has killed thousands of ducks and other waterfowl.
   Because the area is ``critically important'' to migrating birds,
nearby land should be bought to replace the lost habitat.
   _Upper Mississippi River, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois.
   Soil erosion is damaging habitat and reproduction. Wastewater and
pesticide-loaded agricultural runoff is polluting refuge waters and
heavy recreation use is hurting habitat.
   The service should acquire the half of the refuge owned by the
Corps of Engineers and should add staff.
   _Great Swamp, New Jersey.
   Population growth is straining two sewage treatment plants whose
outflow eventually reaches the refuge. Road salt, fertilizer and
pesticides are reaching the refuge and old toxic dumps threaten
contamination.
   Water quality monitoring should be improved and dumps should be
cleaned up.

   You could call Bill Biamonte a political junkie,
but don't bore him with talk about George Bush or Michael Dukakis.
He wears his loyalty on his lapel, on a brown-and-white button that
says it all:
   ``We Need Jerry Brown Back Again!''
   That is not, perhaps, the message you'd expect to hear this year,
especially not from a Long Island man who's been to California just
once in his life, and then for only a brief vacation.
   This is a man who ranks himself as the world's foremost collector
of Jerry Brown political memorabilia, who once ran for college
president on the Jerry Brown ticket, who has followed the former
California governor through the political wilderness and sees the
Promised Land ahead.
   Biamonte _ who tracks reluctant witnesses for the Nassau County
district attorney and is a local political consultant _ started an
organization earlier this year called Jerry Brown Watch and
published the first issue of what he hopes will be a regular
publication, ``The Brownie Journal.''
   The publication, reprinting newspaper articles, goes out to 180
former Brown campaign contributors whose names were on a list
Biamonte bought from the Federal Election Commission.
   ``All along, I think his strength has been that he has a very
dedicated constituency,'' Biamonte said of Brown.
   Biamonte's fascination dates to 1976, when Brown first ran for
president. His interest waned a bit in the succeeding few years, but
when he met Brown during the 1980 presidential campaign, the spark
was rekindled in a hurry.
   ``That's when I got the idea that he was the candidate for the
future,'' he said.
   Brown, the son of a former California governor, was embraced by
many as a sort of new-age Democrat _ an ex-seminarian, a student of
Zen Buddhism, companion of singer Linda Ronstadt and enthusiast of
alternative energy sources like windmills. He often was accused of
blowing with the political wind, as well _ opposing tax cuts, but
then embracing them and pushing through his own cuts.
   Brown lost a bid for U.S. Senate in 1982 and retired from
politics. Biamonte followed his subsequent international wanderings
from afar and began to establish a network of fellow Brownies who
fed each other information.
   Now Biamonte believes his patience may be paying off. Brown
recently announced his candidacy for chairmanship of the California
Democratic Party.
   What does Brown think of this unsolicited support? The former
governor, reached at his Los Angeles law office, seemed momentarily
nonplussed by the question.
   ``Um,'' he said. ``Uh, he ... he's someone who met me several
years ago and he's been an enthusiastic supporter ever since. He's
got a lot of energy and a lot of enthusiasm and he keeps a lot of
people who supported me together.''
   ``He's a completely independent operator in all this,'' Brown
added.
   Biamonte acknowledges that his is strictly a unofficial effort.
But he dreams of a more official role in some future Brown campaign.
   ``That's one of my fantasies,'' he said, ``having a really good
job working for Brown.''
   Such dedication prompts expressions of wonderment from some
former Brown supporters, such as 1980 campaign official Josiah
Beeman.
   ``The guy is just a dedicated, 100 percent Brownie,'' Beeman said.

<HEAD>Documents Show FBI, Military Intelligence, Knew Of Illegal Aid To
Contras</HEAD>

   Two men accused of violating U.S. law by illegally
aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels regularly briefed the FBI and
intelligence agencies about their activities, according to documents
released in a criminal case.
   The documents also show Miami police informed the FBI in
September 1984 of the existence of the Contra-supporting group
Civilian Materiel Assistance, and that drug-trafficking money was
being used to finance the Contra cause.
   The FBI in turn was sending its reports to Oliver North at the
National Security Council.
   FBI spokesman Paul Miller in Miami said Thursday he had not seen
the documents, but added: ``I doubt we will be able to comment
because it concerns a matter before the courts.''
   He did, however, say that the Miami police intelligence report
which told of drug money going to Contra supporters, and said
dynamite was shipped to them on commercial airliners, had been
investigated and found vague.
   The FBI, Miami police, National Security Council and Defense
Intelligence Agency reports were contained in a motion by defense
attorney John Mattes accusing the government of selectively
prosecuting his client, Jack Terrell.
   Terrell and six other men, including CMA founder Thomas Posey and
his Miami coordinator, Jose Coutin, were indicted in Fort Lauderdale
in June on charges of violating the U.S. Neutrality Act in 1984 and
1985. They are accused of illegally recruiting mercenaries and
shipping weapons to aid the Contras.
   ``The documents clearly show the FBI acquiesced in all this
conduct,'' Mattes said. ``They detail the exact persons, their
names, their property and even the exact air strips the Contra
supporters were working from.''
   A declassified report from military intelligence agent Franklin
Camper showed the DIA not only knew of the activities in April 1984,
but outlined for Posey and a Contra official a plan for ``deep
penetration raids into Nicaragua'' by U.S. volunteers and Nicaraguan
rebels.
   As early as January 1985 Posey and Coutin were both reporting
regularly to FBI agents in Miami, Birmingham, Ala., and other
places, advising them of their plans to aid the Contras, their
contacts in Washington and their frequent trips to Central America,
according to the documents.
   Both the FBI and the two men were aware the network might violate
U.S. neutrality laws, which bar launching military activities
against a government with which the nation is at peace.
   A Jan. 23, 1985, FBI report from Birmingham quoted Posey as
saying that on a trip to Washington he was told that the
``neutrality matter'' would be closed.
   Posey told FBI agents in Alabama he had been assured he would not
be prosecuted ``if he continued to cooperate and to provide
intelligence info re: current developments in Central America,'' the
FBI report said.
   A Jan. 8, 1985, FBI report from Miami concludes with a note that
the National Security Council had asked to be given all information
on the case.
   ``FBI headquarters is requested to disseminate above information
to Oliver North, National Security Council, White House,'' it says.
   In all, Coutin and Posey talked to FBI agents in Miami and
Birmingham at least six times in January 1985, and Posey also spoke
to agents in New Orleans.
   Coutin also talked in September 984 to a Miami police unit
investigating a bombing at a bank and mentioned his pro-Contra
activities, the Miami police report said.
   The report also said Coutin told the police that alleged cocaine
trafficker Francisco Chanes was giving money to anti-Castro and
Contra groups, and that ``the monies comes from narcotic
transactions.''
   It said a police source, Jose Sosa, claimed Chanes spent
thousands on the rebels, and that Rene Corvo _ indicted this summer
in an associated Neutrality Act case _ put dynamite in his luggage
on a commercial flight to Costa Rica for delivery to the Contras.
   Miller said a full FBI investigation cast doubt on Sosa's account.

<HEAD>Farmers Started Year With Higher Incomes, Lower Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The financial health of the nation's farmers at
the beginning of 1988 was the best in years, Agriculture Department
economists said Thursday.
   Higher incomes, lower operating costs, a 45 percent increase in
government payments and a modest rise in farm product sales
contributed to the improvement, the department's Economic Research
Service said in an annual review.
   The 176-page analysis did not forecast 1988 financial returns or
assess the impact of this year's drought, although other reports
have pointed to net cash income levels at near the record 1987 level.
   However, those reports emphasized that thousands of farmers have
been hurt severely in 1988 by drought losses to crops and livestock
while others have prospered because of the reduced supplies and
higher prices.
   The latest report said that real net income in 1987 reached $38
billion after adjusting for inflation, the highest level since the
mid-1970s and ``was on a par with that of the 1950s and 1960s.''
   Rising land values, which represent 70 percent of all farm
assets, and lower debt boosted the equity, or net worth, of farmers
as of Jan. 1, 1988, to $571 billion from $537 billion a year
earlier, the report said. That reversed a six-year decline.
   ``The most dramatic farm financial change in the past few years
has been the improvement in the solvency position of farms,'' the
report said.
   Solvency, or the ability to pay debts, is one of the measures of
financial health in the farm sector. Others include liquidity, or
the capability of making payments when they come due, and
profitability, or net farm income.
   ``Higher net farm income in 1987 helped farmers reduce or pay off
debt and provided more farms with enough capital to avoid new debt
financing than in previous years,'' the report said. ``Asset values
rose 3 percent over those of 1986, while debt fell 8 percent to $143
billion in 1987 (the fourth annual decline in a row), leaving the
sector in the best position at any time in the 1980s to meet debt
service obligations.''
   According the an annual survey of farm costs and returns, nearly
80 percent of the nation's farms were profitable in 1987, up from 70
percent in 1986. The report said that nearly 44 percent of all farms
were free of debt at the beginning of 1988, compared with less than
39 percent a year earlier.
   There was a large variation, however, in debt owed by different
size farms. Only 16 percent of the largest _ those with sales of
more than $500,000 a year _ were free of debt at the start of this
year, compared with almost 60 percent of the smallest farms, or
those with sales of less than $10,000 annually.

<HEAD>FCC Eases Ownership Rule for Nearby Radio Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission took a
step Thursday toward shoring up struggling radio stations by voting
to allow common ownership of stations located closer together but
still in different markets.
   By relaxing its ownership rule, the FCC said it would enable more
station owners to take greater advantage of the economies of scale
and cost savings that result from joint ownership of stations.
   The new rule would reduce by about half the distance required
between two stations owned by the same person or company. It also
would allow common ownership of stations in adjacent markets. Under
the new rule, commonly owned stations could be as close as 25 miles.
   The commission had planned also to consider changing other rules
that limit common ownership in the same market to AM-FM combinations
but allow waivers for some UHF-TV and radio combinations. But
commissioners could not agree on the proposed changes.
   The FCC also agreed to recommend that Congress require cable
companies to negotiate with out-of-town TV stations for the rights
to carry their signals. The commission is expected to extend that
recommendation to cover local TV signals before it issues a final
order in the matter.
   Currently, cable companies have a ``compulsory license,'' granted
by Congress in 1976, giving them the right to carry local and
distant broadcast signals for what is often a bargain price. The
system of low prices was established because cable companies were
required to carry local TV signals.
   But FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said the current system
amounts to an ``undue and unwarranted subsidy for the cable
industry,'' particularly since cable companies are no longer
required to carry local broadcast signals.
   Requiring cable companies to negotiate with copyright holders
would establish a system of prices that more closely reflects the
value of programming to viewers, he said.
   It also would raise of price of some programming, which would
likely increase the rates paid by cable subscribers. FCC officials
could not estimate the financial impact, but they said that while
prices might rise, the cable menu of programs would likely be more
attractive to viewers.
   The National Cable Television Association opposes elimination of
the compulsory license, and in a statement noted that before
Congress adjourned last week it extended the license for distant
signals to backyard dish owners.
   The recommendation was reached with some difficulty by the three
sitting FCC commissioners.
   Commissioner James H. Quello refused to go along with Patrick to
expand the recommendation to cover local TV signals and Commissioner
Patricia Dennis withheld her vote on the entire matter until she was
fully satisfied with the tone and conclusions of the agency's report.
   She said, however, that once her concerns are met, she would
probably vote that the recommendation cover both local and distant
signals.

<TEXT>
   Wrestler King Haku suffered two blows in just
one day: a loss to Hulk Hogan and notice he'd been sued for $1.1
million for allegedly trying to bite the nose off a bar patron.
   The wrestler's attorney, Richard M. Summers of Cleveland, said by
telephone Thursday afternoon that he hasn't seen the lawsuit, so he
couldn't comment on it.
   He said, however, that ``there were other witnesses there with
different stories about what happened.'' He also noted there are
pending criminal charges.
   King Haku recently had a lavish televised coronation in the ring
complete with red-velvet throne, golden crown and ermine-trimmed
robe.
   The alleged incident involving the 29-year-old World Federation
bad-guy wrestler occurred June 26.
   He was charged with biting Warren Brent Cooper of Relay and
assaulting Nick J. Stanko Jr. of Severn, the doorman at the Safari
Club in the International Hotel.
   J. Edward Davis, Cooper's lawyer, filed the lawsuit in Baltimore
County Circuit Court in August, but notice was not served on the
6-foot-2, 270-pound wrestler until he returned to Baltimore on
Tuesday.
   King Haku, whose real name is Tonga Uliuli Fifita, lives in
Kissimmee, Fla., and travels a nationwide circuit for the World
Wrestling Federation.
   R. David Fordham, an assistant state's attorney in Anne Arundel
County, said Fifita was charged with assault and battery, a
misdemeanor.
   The lawsuit says Cooper requires plastic surgery and will remain
permanently disfigured.
   Summers said King Haku was on the road, but doesn't know where he
is.
   Steve Planamenta, a spokesman for the Connecticut-based WWF, said
he was unaware of the criminal charges or the damage suit.

<TEXT>
   A couple who believes a child they have
never met is their daughter are prepared to push ahead with a
courtroom custody battle if necessary, their lawyer said Thursday.
   On Wednesday, Robert Mays, a 43-year-old Sarasota roofing supply
salesman, revealed that he has told his 9-year-old daughter,
Kimberly Michelle, of the claims of Regina and Ernest Twigg of
Langhorne, Pa.
   The Twiggs say their healthy newborn was switched for a sickly
infant at Hardee Memorial Hospital in Wauchula, and then hospital
records were altered to cover up the baby-selling scheme.
   The child they took home from the hospital, Arlena, died of a
heart defect in August, after genetic testing that revealed she
could not have been their biological daughter.
   John Blakely, the couple's Florida attorney, said, ``If Kimberly
is their daughter, they do not know of any fact at this time that
would cause them not to pursue custody of their child.
   ``They are simply driven by their natural paternal and maternal
instincts to pursue and protect their own offspring.''
   The Twiggs already have asked a Sarasota court to order a genetic
blood test, a sophisticated scientific means of determining
parentage. No hearing has been set.
   Mays has vowed to fight any effort to remove the child.
   The Twiggs are disturbed that Mays told Kimberly and are unhappy
that he held a news conference and publicly revealed their
identities, Blakely said. Mays' identity had been known to
reporters, who withheld it in order to protect the girl.
   ``Mr. and Mrs. Twigg are upset that Mr. Mays talked to Kimberly
without first talking to them. At this point they believe Kimberly
is their daughter,'' their attorney said. ``If there's been no
genetic testing done ... why expose her to that news before

   Mays, whose first wife, Kimberly's mother, died and who is

<HEAD>Arrest Dozens of Dissidents Who Called Unofficial Rally</HEAD>

   Authorities detained dozens of
dissidents in pre-dawn raids and tightened security in Prague
Thursday at the first official communist celebration of
Czechoslovakia's prewar independence.
   Hundreds of policemen and members of the People's Militia, a
paramilitary force, cordoned off the center of Wenceslas Square,
where tens of thousands massed behind red flags and in organized
groups for the official rally to mark the anniversary of
independence.
   Authorities banned an independent rally called for Friday by
signatories of the human rights document Charter 77 and four other
dissident groups.
   A dissident source who asked not to be identified said about 50
activists were detained in police raids early Thursday, including
dissident playwright Vaclav Havel; Roman Catholic activist Vaclav
Benda; and Petr Uhl, a monitor of political harassment in
Czechoslovakia.
   At least 15 other activists were reported under house arrest, the
source said.
   In Frankfurt, West Germany, the International Society for Human
Rights quoted Czechoslovak activists as saying 122 people were
detained throughout Czechoslovakia. That report could not be
independently confirmed in Prague.
   To mark the 70th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's independence,
authorities announced a limited amnesty freeing prisoners serving
less than two years, or less than three years in the case of crimes
committed through negligence.
   The state news agency CTK did not specify whether the amnesty
included the estimated 70 political prisoners in Czechoslovak jails.
But a legal source suggested the measure could apply to some
first-time political offenders.
   The ban on the unofficial rally followed a protest march by
thousands of people in August on the 20th anniversary of the Warsaw
Pact invasion that crushed reforms. Prague residents said the march
had clearly unnerved the authorities.
   Prague Communist Party boss Miroslav Stepan delivered a stern
warning at Thursday's rally that unofficial groups will not be
tolerated.
   ``We won't allow the process of restructuring and democratization
to be abused by those who don't care for Socialism and their
homeland ... those who are trying to destabilize society,'' Stepan
said.
   ``There is no dialogue here,'' he added.
   His warning echoed similar speeches by Communist Party leader
Milos Jakes and chief ideologist Jan Fojtik at a Communist Party
meeting Oct. 10-12 that signaled Czechoslovakia will not make
sweeping political or economic reforms or follow neighboring Hungary
into toleration of independent groups.
   Earlier Thursday, hundreds of people joined an American tribute
to Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, the president and founder of the
democratic republic, which was set up on Oct. 28, 1918.
   Communist authorities proclaimed Friday a national holiday this
year, reviving a custom in force for three years in the late 1960s,
but otherwise ignored in four decades of socialist rule. The
authorites scheduled the mass rally for Thursday in order to allow
citizens to enjoy a three-day weekend.
   About 300 people jammed the front of the U.S. Embassy to sing
anthems and listen to an emotional rendering of a patriotic poem.
Afterward, they burst into applause and shouted ``Thank you! Thank
you!'' to U.S. Ambassador Julkian Niemczyk and other American
diplomats.
   Dozens of people stuck bouquets on to wall plaques showing
Masaryk, his Slovak ally Milan Rastislav Stefanik and President
Woodrow Wilson, who backed their campaign for Dzechoslovak
independence.
   Officials representing the presidency, the National Assembly and
the communist-led National Front laid wreaths on Masaruyk's grave
for the first time since the liberal era of 1968. Only about 100
people attended the barely publicized ceremony at Lany, 30 miles
west of Prague.
   Masaryk and other Czechoslovak nationalists proclaimed the
democratic republic in the waning days of World War I.
   A respected philosopher, Masaryk was four times elected president
of democratic Czechoslovakia before his death in 1937. In 1938, the
nation he built was dismembered when the Munich Pact between
Britain, France and Adolf Hitler allowed the Nazis to occupy
Czechoslovakia's German-speaking territories.
   Once reviled by the communists, Masaryk remains a potent national
symbol.
   President Gustav Husak lauded him briefly in a ceremony at
Prague's Hradcany Castle, saying Masaryk was respected at home and
abroad. But he did not mention Masaryk's achievements as a
democratic philosopher, nor say what kind of state he headed.
   The official celebrations of National Day appeared to be an
attempt to tap popular sentiment and swing it behind the communist
government.
   But the tough police operation mounted for the occasion indicated
the ruling Politburo doesn't intend to swerve from the course it has
charted in the 20 years since Soviet and Warsaw Pact tanks crushed
the ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   The security operation was believed to be the work of Interior
Minister Frantisek Kincl, who gained his post in a government
reshuffle two weeks ago. Kincl formerly was police chief in northern
and central Moravia, two areas which have the reputation as being
among the toughest on dissidents.

   Thousands of people turned out
today for the first official communist celebration of the nation's
independence in 1918.
   Hundreds of policemen cordoned off downtown Wenceslas Square,
where spectators massed behind red flags and slogans that sought to
link the pre-World War II democracy to today's communist republic.
   Also today, hundreds of people joined an American tribute to the
founder and president of pre-Communist Czechoslovakia.
   Seven prominent signatories of the Charter 77 human rights
document, including dissident playwright Vaclav Havel, Roman
Catholic activist Vaclav Benda and Petr Uhl were detained early
today, according to dissident sources. Tomas Dvorak, a prominent
peace activist, and at least five other young activists also were
detained, said the sources who demanded anonymity.
   The anniversary of independence in 1918 falls on Friday, but
officials decided to hold the rally one day early. Authorities
banned an independent rally called for Friday and warned citizens
not to attend.
   However, for the first time in four decades of rule, communist
authorities proclaimed Oct. 28 a national holiday.
   About 300 people crowded into the entranceway of the U.S. Embassy
today for an American-hosted ceremony honoring Thomas Garrigue
Masaryk, founder and president of Czechoslovakia's democracy.
   Once reviled by the communist authorities, Masaryk remains a
potent national symbol for most Czechoslovaks.
   Masaryk's granddaughter Herberta was among the crowd who sang
anthems and listened to a stirring patriotic poem before bursting
into applause and calling to the American hosts in Czech, ``Thank
you, thank you.''
   Bouquets were placed on and around a plaque showing Masaryk, his
Slovak ally Milan Rastislav Stefanik and President Woodrow Wilson,
who helped them win independence for Czechoslovakia.
   Dozens of people crowded round U.S. Ambassador Julian Niemczyk
after the 20-minute ceremony to thank him for the event, which takes
place each year.
   Elsewhere, for the first time since 1968 when the Communist-led
``Prague Spring'' reforms still held sway, officials laid three
wreaths on Masaryk's grave at Lany, 30 miles west of Prague.
   Only about 100 local villagers attended the low-key ceremony
which, unlike other official events, was little publicized in
advance.
   Masaryk is buried near his country residence of Lany with his
American-born wife Charlotte and their son Jan, a former foreign
minister who died under mysterious circumstances just after the
Communist takeover in 1948.
   With the backing of the United States, Britain and France,
Masaryk and other campaigners for Czechoslovak independence
proclaimed a democratic republic on Oct. 28, 1918.
   World War I was coming to an end, and the giant Austro-Hungarian
empire of which Slovakia and the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia
were part was on the verge of breaking up.
   Masaryk was four times elected president of democratic
Czechoslovakia before his death in 1937.
   In 1938, the nation he built was dismembered by the Munich Pact,
which allowed the Nazis to march into Czechoslovakia's
German-speaking territories.
   At a ceremony at Prague's Hradcany Castle, the current president,
Gustav Husak, lauded Masaryk as a figure of authority at home and
abroad in his time.
   But, according to a text of his speech from the state news agency
CTK, he made no mention of Masaryk's role as a democratic
philosopher and did not refer to the kind of government Masaryk and
his colleagues founded.
   Western diplomats invited to the ceremony had said Communist
Party leader Milos Jakes would speak. But CTK said no speech by
Jakes was expected.

since it was formed in 1971.
   More than 70 musicians have passed through the seven-member
Western swing band.
   ``It's hard to do 200 dates a year for four or five years under
an ogre like myself,'' he said Tuesday. ``If you play with Asleep at
the Wheel for a year and survive, you're going to be a good player.
That's because of what I ask out of the players and because of our

   ``This band right now is as good a band as we've ever had,'' he
said.
   The band plays dance-oriented music such as ``Ain't Nobody Here
But Us Chickens.''

of director Steven Spielberg.
   Irving had nothing but good things to say about her past movie
partners.
   _Richard Dreyfuss (``The Competition''): ``He's very intense, a
hard worker. And a family friend.''
   _Willie Nelson (``Honeysuckle Rose''): ``He's fun, but a wise
man.''
   _Barbra Streisand: ``In `Yentl,' she was like the male lead, and
she gave me the feminine lead. No problems.'' Irving was nominated
for an Academy Award for her role in ``Yentl.''

   Actress Sigourney Weaver, who plays
anthropologist Dian Fossey in a new movie, launched an
adopt-a-gorilla campaign Thursday that will fund research and
anti-poaching efforts begun by Fossey in Africa.
   ``Quite frankly, I'm hooked on the gorillas, which is why I
accepted the position with the Digit Fund,'' Weaver said.
   The fund is named after Digit, the gorilla Fossey made famous in
a National Geographic article. Digit was killed by poachers in 1977
while defending his family.
   Weaver said she and Arnold Glimcher, the producer of the film,
``Gorillas in the Mist,'' will adopt Maggie, one of the gorillas in
the film.
   For $10,000, a donor can adopt a silverback, the mature male of
the species; $5,000 will get a female or immature male. An infant
can be adopted for $1,000 and juveniles are $2,500.
   The money goes to the Digit Fund. The donor receives a photograph
and complete record of the gorilla, including genealogy. Every six
months, an update is sent of the gorilla's behavior and unusual
activities.
   The fund sponsors the Karisoke Research Centre in Rwanda, central
Africa, which helps pay for researchers who record daily scientific
observations of gorilla behavior. The fund also sponsors patrols,
which make daily runs to destroy poachers' traps.

   Lawyers for Shirley Temple Black
agreed to allow the owner of Encino-based Soda Pop Kids Bottling Co.
to label his drink ``Shirley T'' until a suit seeking to ban use of
the name is decided in court.
   Bradley Weidman won the concession from Black, a former child
actress, in San Mateo County Superior Court, where Judge V. Eugene
McDonald had issued a preliminary injunction that bars Weidman from
using the full name ``Shirley Temple'' to advertise his soda pop.
   The agreement allows the 26-year-old entrepreneur to undertake a
national television advertising campaign for Shirley T, a
cherry-flavored drink.
   Black, who lives in Woodside, sued last month, charging Weidman
with violating her privacy rights and of exploiting her name without
her consent. She is a former U.S. ambassador to Ghana.
   Trial is expected early next year.

   The local NAACP president, threatened with
suspension by her national headquarters, reluctantly retracted on
Thursday her day-old endorsement of Republican presidential nominee
George Bush and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, had disavowed the
endorsements by Columbus chapter president Melanie J. Mitchell and
demanded a retraction by late Thursday.
   Hooks said the NAACP is a non-partisan organization whose bylaws
forbid political endorsements.
   Ms. Mitchell said she stood by her endorsements but agreed to
Hooks' demand for a retraction to avoid jeopardizing the chapter's
tax-exempt status as a non-profit organization.
   ``I felt that a message needed to be sent to the black community
of the impending danger of supporting one political party,'' she
said in an telephone interview. ``I believe that in order for
progress to take place for blacks, they must be intricately involved
in the entire political process, which includes involvement in both
political parties.''
   Hooks said Ms. Mitchell was told in a telegram and a telephone
call Thursday ``to issue a public statement repudiating, in its
entirety, this position immediately upon receipt of this
communication.''
   ``Failure to do so will result in your immediate suspension,''
she was told.
   Ohio NAACP president James Daniels also condemned the
endorsements, made in a news release issued Wednesday under the
NAACP's letterhead.
   In that statement, Ms. Williams said the NAACP ``does not give
political endorsements ... (but) we must offer support to those
persons who hold political offices, or are seeking such offices,
whose ideals, activities, practices or policies are in the best
interest of minorities.''
   Cornell McClearly, vice president of the Columbus chapter, told
The Columbus Dispatch on Wednesday that the decision to endorse Bush
and Metzenbaum was prompted by a belief that loyalty solely to the
Democratic Party was ``totally counterproductive.''
   Before Ms. Mitchell's retraction, Keith McNamara, the Ohio
chairman of the Bush campaign, said he was ``absolutely delighted''
by the endorsement, which he said supports GOP expectations that the
vice president ``will win a larger portion of the black vote this
fall than even President Reagan did.''

   ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' soared into the
stratosphere Thursday, the first day of the movie's release on
videocassette.
   ``Nobody's buying just one,'' said Gail Boswell, manager of Tower
Video. ``I had one customer come in and buy 120 cassettes. Others
are buying two or three or four.''
   Demand has been so great that MCA Home Video, the video's
packager, has been unable to fill orders. Some retailers will
receive only 75 percent of their requests.
   Boswell said she ordered 2,500 cassettes, expected 1,700 but
received only 1,200.
   In any case, MCA Home Video, a subsidiary of MCA Inc., could
enjoy revenues of close to $200 million from the ``E.T.'' sales.
   There are more than 11 million advance orders for the $24.95
video. Pepsi Cola is sponsoring a $5 ``E.T.'' rebate offer, and will
promote the video in a $25 million advertising campaign. There is no
Pepsi commercial on the video itself.
   Most movies are released within six months of their opening in
movie theaters. ``E.T.,'' released in 1982, has never been shown on
broadcast or cable television.
   The video release of the movie was delayed because Steven
Spielberg, the film's director and producer, told Universal several
years ago that he wanted the cassettes to be affordable.
   The previous low price for a major video release was last year's
``Top Gun,'' which sold for $26.95. About 3 million ``Top Gun''
cassettes were bought. ``Cinderella,'' which has sold more than 5
million copies in the last month, is priced at $26.99.

   Sudden infant death syndrome continues to be a
leading cause of premature mortality, and an increase among white
male infants may signal an important trend, federal health officials
said Thursday.
   SIDS, which strikes about one in 500 U.S. infants, ranks seventh
among causes of premature mortality in the Centers for Disease
Control's tabulations of ``years of potential life lost.''
Unintentional injuries rank first.
   The CDC measures the loss of ``potential life'' _ in deaths
before age 65 _ as a means of gauging the effects of premature
mortality. Age 65 is a statistical benchmark; actual U.S. life
expectancy today is higher.
   During 1980-83, SIDS robbed white male infants of ``potential
life'' at the rate of 97 years per 1,000 births, while the rate for
females was 65. By 1984-85, the rate for white male babies had risen
to 100, while the females' rate had fallen to 61.
   The rate for black males fell from 185 to 167, and the rate for
black females fell from 151 to 134.
   ``The slight increases ... among white males ... should be
monitored, to determine a possible emerging trend,'' the
Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.
   The increase might be attributed to one of two factors, said Dr.
Jose Becerra, a SIDS specialist with the CDC. ``It could be due
either to increased incidence of SIDS, or a decrease in age at
death, in this (white male) group,'' he said.
   If white male SIDS babies were, for some reason, dying younger
than other SIDS babies, their ``years of potential life lost'' _
before 65 _ would thus be higher, Becerra explained.
   In actual terms, SIDS would also seem to be on the increase among
white males. In 1984, 2,295 SIDS deaths were reported among white
baby boys, rising to 2,390 in 1985. Over the same period, white
female SIDS cases increased by just six from 1,361 to 1,367, black
male cases fell from 799 to 775 and black female cases fell from 640
to 582.
   Overall, 5,245 U.S. SIDS cases were reported in 1984 and 5,315 in
'85, the CDC noted.
   The mystery surrounding SIDS _ defined as ``the sudden death of
an infant,'' unexpectedly and without ``an adequate cause of
death,'' also contributes to the uncertainty in studying it, Becerra
said. In 1985, about 93 percent of U.S. SIDS deaths were confirmed
by autopsy, but that leaves ``a substantial number where no autopsy
was made, so the diagnosis is in doubt,'' he said.

   Two murder convicts took a counselor and a
teacher hostage today in the library of Northern State Prison, but
released both of them unharmed and surrendered within several hours,
authorities said.
   The incident ended about 4 p.m. when the inmates released the
second hostage, Joan Mason, 51, of Newark. About 2{ hours earlier,
the two men had freed Annette Martin, 46, also of Newark.
   Capt. Robert Baker of the state Department of Corrections said
the women were uninjured and that inmates Angel Guzman, 26, and
Edward Robinson, 27, surrendered peacefully after releasing their
hostages. They had been armed with homemade, spear-like weapons.
   Martin, a teacher assistant, and Mason, a counselor, were taken
hostage shortly after 9 a.m. while they conducted a teaching session
in the library of the year-old Northern State Prison.
   James Stabile, spokesman for the corrections department, said the
two inmates' only demands were that they be transferred to a federal
prison outside New Jersey and that officials take no reprisals
because of the hostage taking.
   Stabile described the inmates' weapons as long, metal rods with
sharpened points.
   Earlier, negotiators talked through a meshed metal window to the
inmates who used Martin as a shield.
   ``The hostage was right in front of the window between the inmate
and the window with a metal rod pointed right at her head or her
neck,'' Stabile said.
   Guzman, formerly of Woodbine, N.J., was sentenced in 1982 to 17
years in prison for shooting his uncle to death over a $70 debt in
Cape May County. Robinson, formerly of Camden, N.J., was sentenced
to life in prison in 1979 for a murder in Camden County. Prison
records showed both men had records of assaulting fellow inmates.
   Mason is a vocational counselor who has worked at the prison for
about a year. Martin is a teaching assistant who started working at
the prison in March. Both women are from Newark.
   The $18 million Northern State Prison opened last year, making it
the newest prison in the state. The medium security prison houses
about 1,000 inmates at the $18 million prison in individual cells.
   After the women were taken hostage, authorities locked the other
inmates in their cells and called in the state's special operations
group, which consists of negotiators, emergency rescue crews and a
heavily-armed, black uniformed assault team.
   Warden Robert Stephens and Gary Hilton, the assistant state
commissioner for adult institutions, were leading the negotiating
team.

   The expressed intention of the Soviet Union to
release all political prisoners by the end of the year may refer
only to a small group of people, perhaps as few as 20, the State
Department said Thursday.
   Spokesman Charles Redman said the two superpowers continue to
disagree on the definition of exactly what constitutes a political
prisoner.
   He said Moscow insists the term fits only those actually charged
with political offenses, while Washington says it also should
include those jailed on ``trumped-up charges.''
   ``We've long pressed for the release of Soviet political
prisoners,'' Redman told reporters. ``The Soviets finally accept
that there are such prisoners, but we continue to disagree on a
definition.''
   He said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told U.S.
officials during a visit to the United States last month that there
were only about 40 such prisoners, all of whom had been convicted
for violations of the political and religious articles of the Soviet
criminal code.
   But Redman said U.S. officials have raised with the Soviets the
names of some 200 prisoners, including those jailed on fabricated
charges.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told reporters in Moscow on
Wednesday that he had been assured in talks with Soviet officials
that all political prisoners would be released within 10 weeks.
   However, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov,
refused to confirm or deny that a release of political prisoners is
imminent, saying there are only about two dozen such prisoners.
   ``The recent remarks made to Chancellor Kohl are an indication
that all political prisoners will be released,'' Redman said. ``But
Mr. Gerasimov's statement, which followed that, leads us to believe
that the Soviets may be referring only to the 40-some prisoners
raised during Shevardnadze's visit in September here.''
   Responding to questions, Redman said he believed that about half
of those 40 prisoners had been released in recent weeks leaving only
about 20 or so on the Soviet list.

   Lenore, 25, tips the scales at 230 while her
friend, Terra, weighs in at 275 pounds. These simian grand dames
need a fat farm _ and fast, say medical experts at Lincoln Park Zoo.
   But just how do you tell a lady gorilla she's too fat? Very
carefully.
   An even trickier question: How do you get her to eat low-fat fare
while the rest of her pals are getting the usual?
   Veterinarians, borrowing from the human fitness craze, are using
body composition analysis and blood tests to determine just how big
is too big for six lowland gorillas that call Lincoln Park their
home.
   The study is spurred by concerns that a matronly gorilla may have
some difficulty becoming a mom, chief zoo veterinarian Thomas Meehan
said this week.
   Members of the zoo staff noticed that the youngest, slimmest and
trimmest of the female gorillas were better reproducers. But until
the veterinarians finish analyzing test results in several weeks,
they aren't sure whether other gorillas are fat because they're old,
not conceiving offspring because they're fat or old, or all of the
above.

   Brawny athletes quaked in their tennis shoes
and female volleyball players ran out screaming as sparrow-sized
bats swooped through the University of Central Florida gymnasium.
   ``We've got guys who are 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds ...,'' said
basketball coach Phil Carter. ``I bet the bats don't weigh an
ounce.''
   The harmless bug-eating bats, which have a wingspan of about six
inches, were some of the thousands displaced from inside the ceiling
of an education complex, which includes the gym, over the weekend.
   The bats were discovered in May, but because they were breeding,
officials decided to wait until Friday to block the entry holes to
their ceiling homes.
   Some of the bats unexpectedly flew into the gym this week,
apparently through open doors, and ``our girls went crazy. They were
screaming and running,'' said women's coach Bev Knight.
   The men did no better. One player crawled on the floor to avoid a
dive-bombing bat. Others kept one eye on the bats and another on the
basketball.
   After all the commotion Wednesday, student Paul Zeiser was
designated as bat-catcher. He waited until the bats landed, then
threw a towel over them and took them outside. He caught five
Wednesday.

   Demands for improved safety procedures at U.S.
nuclear weapons-making plants mounted Thursday as 31 members of the
House Armed Services Committee appealed directly to President Reagan.
   ``This crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period, and
it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance, safety and
operating conditions,'' the lawmakers said in a companion letter to
Energy Secretary John S. Herrington.
   The letters, drafted by Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., and signed by
committee chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., urged Reagan to appoint
quickly the five-member Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which
Congress ordered created this fall to oversee the troubled weapons
complex.
   The lawmakers expressed particular concern over the Savannah
River Plant at Aiken, S.C., where the Energy Department's last three
operational weapons production reactors have been shut down for
safety reasons. The first will not resume producing nuclear weapons
material until January, Energy Department officials have said.
   ``We will expect the department not to restart a reactor befor
assuring our committee that the applicable operating procedures
assure an adequate margin of safety,'' they said in the letter to
Herrington.
   National security adviser Colin Powell, answering questions
Thursday during an appearance at the National Press Club, said
resolving the problems was ``a top priority'' in the Reagan
administration. But he added that ``this is going to take more than
a few slogans. ... It's going to take a lot of money.''
   ``There are no magic-bullet solutions,'' he said. ``These
problems developed over a long period of time. We did not make the
necessary investment during the '50s and '60s to upgrade these aging
facilities.''
   Four of DOE's 17 sites have been partially or wholly shut down
this year over safety concerns, prompting hearings before House and
Senate panels. On Wednesday, a nationwide anti-nuclear group,
Physicians for Social Responsibility, said the problems ``constitute
a public health emergency,'' and urged medical studies on cancer
rates among workers and neighbors of the plants.
   In other developments, government documents obtained by The
Associated Press show that the Energy Department gave a manager of
the Savannah River Plant $59,750 in awards for excellence despite
continuing problems there.
   The manager, Robert Morgan, who retired early this year, is one
of many individuals and organizations that received cash bonuses
totaling millions of dollars despite a steady decline in safety at
Savannah River, which is a weapons production facility run by the
Energy Department for the Pentagon.
   A DOE spokesman, Will Callicott, said he was not aware of any
plans to review the system of awards.
   Morgan received the bonuses in 1981-1987 despite growing safety
problems which finally forced the department this year to shut down
the reactors at Savannah River, according to Energy Department
documents and Capitol Hill testimony. The three reactors began
operating in 1954.
   Memoranda in 1987 and 1988 document the failure of department
officials to persuade Morgan to implement safety guidelines.
   On Oct. 16, 1987, Mary L. Walker, then the assistant energy
secretary for environment, safety and health, wrote Morgan and Troy
Wade, then deputy assistant secretary, complaining they were not
heeding an order for stricter operating procedures and evaluation of
potential damage from an earthquake at Savannah River.
   ``The cited inability of SR (Savannah River) to adequately
implement its safety oversight program, including sufficient
day-to-day surveillance and deficiency follow-up, is unacceptable,''
wrote Walker, who has since left the job.
   On March 21, 1988, Morgan sent a letter to Walker's temporary
successor, Garry W. Gibbs, saying that his ``office considers that
the concerns raised are unfounded and feels that much
misunderstanding exists within the Office of Environment, Safety and
Health in the area of SR seismic design and criteria.''
   On May 20, 1988, Richard W. Starostecki, who has assumed Walker's
duties, wrote a blistering letter to Morgan's successor, Paul W.
Kaspar.
   ``It appears that the seismic upgrading that has been
accomplished (and is now under way) has been a piecemeal, largely
reactive response and that planning, control and documentation have
been seriously neglected,'' Starostecki wrote.
   ``Criteria, analytical methods and analyses appear fragmented,
incomplete and inconclusive,'' he wrote.
   Morgan was of many individuals and contractors who received cash
awards for excellence at Energy Department nuclear facilities,
despite mounting problems. Other such individuals cited in an Oct.
26, 1983, letter from Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
House subcommittee on oversight and investigations, included:
   _Herman Roser, then assistant secretary, received $36,917 in
bonuses 1980-83, although according to Dingell he ``killed the
independent assessment program which had been severely critical of
his security program'' when he ran the department's regioffect when longer-term
loans
are agreed to. Economic forecaster Jonathan Heath said the agreement
would help Mexico out of a short-term economic trap.
   An official of the Department of Energy, Mines and State-Owned
Companies said Mexico has lost at least $2 billion in anticipated
1988 revenues because of the depressed oil market. Last year's oil
revenues totaled about $8.6 billion.
   Mexico's first-half merchandise trade surplus through June was
$2.4 billion, well below 1987's first-half surplus of $4.76 billion,
according to the Center for Private Economic Studies.
   The price of Isthmus, a major grade of light Mexican crude,
dropped from $13.77 a barrel in August to $12.80 in September for
U.S. customers; it was as high as $17.00 in December 1987. In 1985
and 1986, Isthmus went from $25 a barrel to $10.
   Pemex, the government oil monopoly, has sharply criticized the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for overproduction and
for indulging in an undeclared price war, especially in the U.S.
market, Pemex's largest customer.
   Mexico, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, doesn't belong to
OPEC but usually follows its pricing policies. Pemex, however, said
it didn't plan to join in price cutting and would not try to produce
more to make up for lost revenue.

<HEAD>Philippines to Sue Westinghouse For Losses In Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippines will sue Westinghouse
Corp. for building a $2.3-billion nuclear power plant that never
went into operation because of alleged safety defects, a top
presidential aide said Thursday.
   Adolfo Azcuna, President Corazon Aquino's legal adviser, told
reporters the suit was likely to be filed in the United States
``within a month.''
   ``We are suing for damages and breach of contract,'' Azcuna said.
He said other parties may be sued too but he declined to identify
them.
   Construction of the plant began in the mid-1970s, with completion
delayed by scandals involving alleged kickbacks to then-President
Ferdinand Marcos and questions about its safety.
   The plant was completed nearly three years ago, but Mrs. Aquino's
government decided to junk it for reasons of safety. Officials said
the plant would have required hundreds of millions of dollars more
for safety guarantees which her financially strapped government
coult not afford.
   In addition to questions about its design, opponents of the
plant, located on Bataan province 50 miles west west of Manila, say
it sits on an earthquake fault and is near a volcano.
   After being rocked by the kickback scandal in 1978, construction
was suspended for nearly a year while the plant's design was studied
following the Three Mile Island accident. The re-evaluation ended in
design modifications that further bloated the plant's cost.
   Much of the money for the plant came from foreign loans.
   Aquino administration officials often cite the plant as an
example of the needless expenses incurred during the administration
of Marcos which burdened the Philippines with a $28 billion foreign
debt.
   Officials said that interest alone on the loans for the nuclear
power plant totalled more than $300,000 a day.
   Azcuna told reporters the government decided to sue Westinghouse
failing to reach a settlement with the Pittsburgh-based company.
   ``The legal panel is studying the alternatives of filing the case
either in the United States or in the Philippines, and the
probability is that it will be filed in the United States,'' he
said. ``We have engaged U.S. counsel to help us in doing this and
the timing would be very soon.''
   Pressed by reporters for a date, Azcuna replied, ``It was about
to be foiled last month, so I would say within a month.''
   He refused to give more details of the suit. Other sources said
the complaint won't cite any specific amount in damages and would
leave it to the U.S. courts.
   The Aquino government was under pressure two years ago to
repudiate loans to the nuclear project, but it refused to do so for
fear of possible backlash from foreign banks with which she is
renegotiating her country's outstanding debts.
   Officials who asked not to be identified said that litigation was
the safest way to deal with the problem especially because the
government has convincing evidence that the plant is unsafe and its
construction characterized by fraud.

   A proposal to draw up an international list of
governments and experts willing to cooperate against airplane
hijackers has won overwhelming approval from an international
conference on aviation security, Britain's top aviation official
said Thursday.
   Lord Brabazon of Tara, parliamentary undersecretary of state for
aviation, said methods are being worked out by the International
Civil Aviation Organization.
   ``A hijacking is an attack on us all, an offense to us all, and a
danger to us all and we must act collectively to diminish the risk
and to lessen the consequences,'' he told the Fifth International
Civil Aviation Security Conference.
   The four-day meeting, sponsored by the Federal Aviation
Administration, ended on Thursday.
   Lord Brabazon noted the ICAO had also quickly taken up and
approved the British position that a hijacked plane should not be
refueled or allowed to take off unless that is necessary to protect
human life. The idea was endorsed by President Reagan and the
leaders of six other major non-Communist governments at their
meeting in Toronto last June.

   Israel has a new nightly TV show, and it can get
pretty violent with its rioting hooligans, masked stone-throwers and
battling tanks.
   It isn't the latest American cop show, but the nightly string of
political campaign ads, a crucial tool in reaching undecided voters.
   Unlike in the United States, where the presidential campaign is
waged via the nightly news and periodic commercials, Israeli law
bars state-run radio and television from covering candidates in the
final month before the vote.
   Instead, the 27 parties competing for 120 Parliament seats are
given free access to prime time TV to get their message across.
Since the beginning of the month, the two-minute spots have been
running back-to-back in 40-minute periods after the evening news.
   The commercials, ranging from slick to amateurish, feature some
serious political debate, but more often use gimmicks, fancy
graphics and, recently, nasty attacks on political rivals.
   Leaders of both the left-leaning Labor Party and the right-wing
Likud bloc, the main political rivals, say the rhetoric may get
rougher before Tuesday's vote.
   In one ad this week, Labor called Likud leaders liars for
allegedly forging polls, described their supporters as primitive
hooligans, and tried to show the party as hopelessly divided.
   To make the point, the spot showed shouting Likud supporters
smashing equipment at a rally. In the same ad, rival party leaders
Yitzhak Shamir, David Levy and Ariel Sharon were seen barking
insults, with these clips intercut with cartoons of medieval knights
charging at each other.
   The spot closed with a cartoon of a sinking ship interspersed
with shots of a fist-pounding Shamir, who called Likud a ``movement
that fights for its existence.''
   Ronnie Milo, head of Likud's TV campaign, watched that ad
Wednesday night and then told reporters: ``We'll get a little
tougher in the next couple of days.''
   Likud kept its promise Thursday night with a sharp attack on
Labor leader Shimon Peres. ``Yesterday, Labor showed what it thinks
about Likud,'' said an announcer. ``We don't want to tell you what
we think about Shimon Peres, but what Labor people say about him.''
   The spot then flashed across the screen uncomplimentary quotes
about Peres attributed to former Labor prime ministers, including
founding father David Ben Gurion, who allegedly said of his protege:
``Don't believe him, don't get close to him.''
   As the quotes were splashed across the screen, Peres' image
appeared in a corner, his face contorted in various grimaces.
   In addition to personal attacks, the ads often appeal to the
viewers' emotions, especially on the issue of Middle East peace and
how Israel should deal with the Palestinian uprising.
   This week, Labor showed a middle-aged widow who pleaded for a
peace settlement so her teen-age son would not be killed in a war
like his father.
   The next day, Likud hit back with an elderly Israeli, Viktor
Eldad Azkirelli, who lost a son in war. Addressing the war widow,
Azkirelli said: ``I felt you were being used. ... I'm against
involving bereaved families in the election campaign.''
   To work out these responses, both parties employ ``focus groups''
_ voters representing the political spectrum who rate the ads every
night.
   Likud invites a different focus group of about 50 voters to its
campaign headquarters every night. After viewing each ad, the voters
push buttons ranking them on a scale of one to five.
   Likud campaign strategist Binyamin Netanyahu said the party
decided to bring on the bereaved father because the focus group felt
the spot with the war widow was a ``manipulation of grief.''
   The big parties dominate the nightly show because air time is
alloted according to representation in the Knesset, or Parliament.
But the smaller parties get their shot, too.
   Some of the seven religious parties feature wailing ram horns and
bearded rabbis speaking with almost evangelical fervor against the
moral decay of Israeli society.
   One ad by the liberal Citizens Rights Party featured puppets
arguing campaign issues, and a commercial for the right-wing
Crossroads Party used a graphic in which the Star of David on the
Israeli flag turns into the party symbol.
   Other ads have shown masked Palestinian stone-throwers, Israeli
tanks in the field, and even PLO leader Yasser Arafat toting a gun.
   Some are critical of the ads, whose production costs use up a
large chunk of the $30 million the parties spend on the campaign.
   ``They (the ads) are based on a common denominator of viewing the
potential voter as infantile and retarded,'' wrote the daily Yediot
Ahronot.
   The ads may not be making their point either, considering that
viewership dropped from more than 70 percent earlier this month to
about 43 percent.
   But the commercials are still the most direct way to reach
undecided voters, estimated at 8 percent of the electorate of 2.9
million, who are considered crucial to the outcome by both major
parties.

   Politicians have come to understand that
you have to be pretty quick to a punch line to hold a crowd, and on
Thursday Dan Quayle fell victim _ for just a moment _ to an
overenthusiastic supporter.
   In his stump speech, the Republican vice presidential candidate
usually mentions that Michael Dukakis has linked himself to former
President Harry Truman. This gives Quayle a chance to parody Lloyd
Bentsen and poke some fun at himself by delivering the remark, ``But
he's no Harry Truman.''
   The reference is to Bentsen's debate putdown when Quayle compared
his experience to that of President Kennedy _ Bentsen said he had
known Kennedy and told Quayle, ``You're no Jack Kennedy.''
   At a fund-raising breakfast, Quayle said Dukakis had been
referring again to Truman, but before he could deliver the punch
line, a man in the audience shouted out, ``He's no Harry Truman.''
   That provoked laughter and left Quayle momentarily stymied. But
he barely missed a beat before pointing to the man and said, ``That
man, he doesn't know Michael Dukakis. He has never even served with
Michael Dukakis, but he's right. Michael Dukakis is no Harry
Truman.''

   Quayle shrugs off lingering questions about his National Guard
service as ``side events,'' but has not entirely escaped the
Vietnam-era issue.
   Along with admirers as Quayle stumped through the South this
week, there were naysayers. Signs reading ``Chickenhawk'' or ``Why
Did Quayle Cross The Road: To Get to the National Guard'' have
greeted him at rallies throughout the fall, and the resentment even
spilled over to a self-described Republican who served among his
local police contingent in Miami on Wednesday.
   The policeman told a reporter he'd intended to vote for George
Bush until Bush tapped Quayle as his running mate. Now, the officer
said, he will simply not vote on Nov. 8. He said he ``couldn't
believe'' he had to protect Quayle, whom he called ``a draft
dodger.''
   Quayle enlisted in the Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam
War when many of his peers were being drafted. Quayle has said he
was not trying to avoid the draft, but simply chose a course that
would allow him to attend law school while fulfilling his military
obligation.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   At an earlier stop in Florida, Quayle let reporters know he had
not forgotten the drubbing they gave him over his military service,
his record as a mediocre student and other aspects of his background.
   He was given a blue ``static jacket'' to wear during a tour of a
Tampa, Fla., Honeywell plant where highly sensitive components for
the Space Shuttle and Trident missile are made.
   Outside, the Indiana senator still had the jacket on when he
addressed a rally.
   ``I was given this static jacket and I'm going to use it when I
hold my next news conference,'' joked the senator, who currently
enjoys mostly friendly relations with the press and often comes back
on the plane to chat with them.
   Later, as he climbed the steps of his campaign plane, Quayle
laughed down at the reporters watching him from the tarmac and waved
the jacket, pointing to them.
   By the time most of the reporters came aboard from the back of
the plane, the jacket was hanging from above the first row of press
seating.

   When Quayle arrived in Fort Lauderdale for a fund-raiser at the
Marriott Hotel, many beachwear-clad people seemed startled at the
motorcade whizzing through the sunny streets.
   Two young men spun around as the motorcade pulled past them, and
they burst out laughing when they saw the open-backed stationwagon
with a TV news camera crew shooting the senator's car up ahead.
   ``It's Elvis,'' one of the young men said to the other.

   Republicans and Democrats cried foul Thursday
after President Reagan, despite a written pledge of support from his
budget office, said he would veto a bill that would protect federal
employees who blow the whistle on government wrongdoing.
   ``It's outrageous conduct and has created a bipartisan explosion,
because it violates the basic understanding we need but now no
longer have ... that an administration's word is good,'' said the
chief Senate sponsor of the bill, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
   The president said he would ``pocket veto'' the bill _ let it die
by refusing to sign it while Congress is out of session.
   While the budget office pledged support for the bill, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, whose objections led to the veto decision,
said the Justice Department had expressed its concerns about the
legislation to Congress ``as recently as a week or two ago.
   ``The constitutional objections that the Department of Justice
conveyed to President Reagan had been consistently conveyed to the
Congress throughout the course of consideration of this bill,''
Thornburgh told reporters.
   But on Oct. 3, Joseph R. Wright Jr., deputy director of the
Office of Management and Budget, wrote Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y.,
and chief House sponsor, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   ``I would like to congratulate you on the fine work you have done
over the last eight months to develop the `Whistleblower Protection
Act of 1988,'' Wright wrote Horton. ``While this bill does not
include everything we wanted, it will significantly improve
protection for whistleblowers _ a goal which the administration
shares with you.''
   After citing specific strengths of the bill, Wright concluded,
``These new authorities are significant and I would like to thank
you personally for the repeated efforts you have made to work with
the administration on developing S.508.''
   The House and Senate had passed the bill without a dissenting
vote following months of negotiations between congressional sponsors
and the administration. Disgruntled lawmakers said Thursday they
thought the talks had produced a bill satisfactory to the
administration.
   Asked whether the Justice Department had signed off on any
compromise bill, Thornburgh said: ``Not to my knowledge.''
   Asked whether Wright got approval to make any deals with
Congress, Thornburgh said, ``I don't know.''
   Horton said he supported the bill ``only when I was assured of
the administration's support.''
   Horton called Reagan's decision ``a reprehensible act ...
orchestrated after adjournment of the Congress to prevent an
override.''
   ``We worked with the administration far too closely for
Thornburgh and company to now suggest there are unresolved
constitutional questions,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
``But then this administration hasn't exactly a sterling record
where whistleblowers are concerned.''
   Grassley said he was ``outraged, though not completely
surprised.''
   One federal whistleblower, Nancy Kusen of Pittsburgh, said of
Reagan's decision, ``I really thought it was a very bad move on his
part. It makes me sick.''
   She said the current lack of strong protection ``keeps people
like myself from speaking out on fraud, waste and abuse. There's a
lot of it around. I mean a ton of it.''
   Ms. Kusen, a contract administrator for the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, said she was harassed and passed over for promotion
after reporting some $8 million in overpricing by a contractor
selling ship propulsion equipment to the Navy.
   She said the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates
federal whistleblower cases, took more than a year to investigate
the retaliation. She said that before the inquiry could be
completed, those she had accused of harassment left the agency and
she dropped the complaint.
   Reagan said Wednesday the bill would have allowed employees ``who
are not genuine whistleblowers'' to manipulate the process to delay
or avoid proper discipline.
   Reagan said the bill would have caused constitutional problems
because it would have allowed executive branch agencies to go to
court against each other. The president has the power to resolve
disputes between his subordinates, he said.
   ``I regret that the Congress did not present me with
constitutional and effective legislation to expand the protections
and procedural rights afforded to federal employees who report
fraud, waste and abuse they discover in federal programs,'' the
president said in a statement.
   ``The interests of both employees and managers should be fully
protected,'' the president said. He pledged to submit his own bill
in January when Congress returns.
   Sponsors said the whistleblower bill was needed because the
Office of Special Counsel, established to represent the interests of
whistleblowers, was not doing its job.
   The bill would have made the Office of Special Counsel an
independent agency and would have defined its role clearly as one of
protecting whistleblowers. The office now is part of the Merit
Systems Protection Board and at times it has acted against
whistleblowers who came to the office for help.

   President Reagan's national security adviser,
Colin Powell, on Thursday credited Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for pushing economic reform, but said it ``remains to be
seen'' how much improvement can be made under a communist, one-party
system.
   Powell, an Army lieutenant general, said it has become clear,
however, that the Soviets have chosen to pursue a policy of
declining adventurism in foreign policy so they can focus ``energies
and resources on internal economic reform.''
   ``The bold new leadership in the Kremlin has candidly
acknowledged the problems the Soviet system faces,'' Powell said in
a speech prepared for delivery to the National Press Club. ``But the
problems are fundamental, even structural.''
   Soviet officials in Moscow on Thursday said they will begin
liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the
nation's economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach $58
billion next year.
   Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet legislature
that Gorbachev's government is finding it difficult to bring deficit
spending under control.
   In his speech, Powell took his audience on a tour of world
trouble spots, saying resistance forces fighting communism and
totalitarians have made great strides in Afghanistan, Angola, and
Cambodia. But Powell said the push for freedom in Nicaragua has
lagged, at least in part because of divisions within the United
States on support for the Contra rebels.
   He said a principal lesson to be learned from the various
regional conflicts is that American foreign policy has tended to
succeed in instances in which U.S. support was unquestioned. He said
this included Afghanistan, where the Soviets have begun pulling out
forces that have occupied the Southwest Asian nation since 1979 but
were fought continuously by the Mujahedeen resistance.
   ``The Soviets are correctly reassessing their past foreign
policy, including their adventurism in the 1970s, as a series of
mistakes,'' Powell said, because they and their allies were unable
to consolidate their gains.
   ``One lesson here is that sometimes leaders have the wit to see
the futility of war, to see diplomatic solutions,'' he said. ``But
the deeper lesson is that effective resistance to aggression is what
demonstrates the futility of war.''
   Of the changing political climate in the Soviet Union, he said:
``Essentially, perestroika is an acknowledgment of the failure of
the Soviet system to provide for its people. Whether it can be fixed
as long as it remains a communist, one-party system remains to be
seen.''
   But Powell also said that Gorbachev, who recently took on the
additional title of president of the Soviet Union with the
retirement of Andrei Gromyko, is facing problems with ``restive
nationalities in the Soviet Union and around the Soviet empire.''
   This, he said, is going to ``preoccupy Moscow more than anyone
anticipated.''
   ``There is little we can do to affect the Soviet Union's internal
evolution,'' said Powell, who plans to resume his active duty
military career when Reagan's term ends Jan. 20. ``We can encourage
steps that are clearly improvements in Soviet internal political
practice, even if they do not correspond fully to what we know as
democracy.''
   Reagan on Wednesday voiced hope that Gorbachev would free
remaining political prisoners in the Soviet Union _ as West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl had indicated following talks with Kremlin
officials.
   ``Our adversaries face a systemic crisis,'' Powell said. ``They
sense that their system is wrong but they are seeking to fix it
without changing it wholesale. It is not yet clear whether they can
succeed.''
   ``The immediate problem they're facing is an economic system that
is not up to the demands of the 1990s and the 21st century,'' he
said in answer to a question from the audience.
   Powell said the Soviets will be ``left behind'' in global
economic competition ``unless they make the necessarty adjustments.''

   Seven Latin American presidents on
Thursday demanded a ``new dialogue'' with the United States and
other developed lands on foreign debt, drug trafficking, strife in
Central America and other topics.
   All suggested that foreign debts be renegotiated. Brazil alone
owes $121 billion.
   Speaking forcefully and at times with bitterness and anger, the
presidents said in separate speeches that their calls were prompted
by economic stagnation at home and rising public discontent.
   They said they believe the developed countries, particularly the
United States, either contribute to their problems or can help in
some way they have not so far attempted.
   President Alan Garcia of Peru got a standing ovation when he
said: ``The American people should know that a Latin America that is
disunited is not a good neighbor, that a Latin America that is
impoverished is not a good market.''
   Garcia spoke before an inaugural ceremony audience of about 500
diplomats and guests at the second meeting of the so-called Group of
Eight _ now only seven minus Panama.
   Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid declared: ``Budget
adjustments, austerity programs and economic stagnation have made
the 1980s the lost decade (for many Latin American countries).''
   The Group of Eight was formed in 1986 to develop common positions
on regional problems.
   Panama was suspended after Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the real
power behind Panama's elected civilian government, ousted elected
President Eric Arturo Delvalle last February.
   Brazil and Argentina currently are suffering severe bouts of
inflation. Mexico and Venezuela have been hurt economically by
falling world prices for oil. Colombia is engaged in a full-fledged
battle against cocaine and marijuana traffickers. Peru is battling a
guerrilla insurgency. Uruguay, with 3 million inhabitants, has a $6
billion foreign, one of the highest per capita debts in Latin
America.
   The United States and other industrial nations could help, the
presidents said, by renegotiating foreign debts to put a priority on
economic growth in borrowing countries; by cracking down on users of
illegal drugs; by reducing protectionist legislation that limits
imports, and by helping promote a peaceful solution to conflict in
Central America.
   ``It is necessary to put mechanisms in place in our region to
reduce (interest) payments as well as procedures to prevent their
re-escalation,'' said President Jose Sarney of Brazil, those country
is the developing world's most indebted nation.
   President Virgilio Barco of Colombia said:
   ``Since January, 4,559 people involved in this crime (drug
trafficking) have been arrested, 17,326 kilos of cocaine have been
seized ... and 497,000 kilos of marijuana. We also have seized
hundreds of weapons, thousands of kilos of ammunition, hundreds of
vehicles, boats and planes...
   ``Meanwhile ... in the capitals of developed nations, drugs
circulate with startling ease. The civil liberties of consumers
cannot be considered more important than the stability of democracy
in nations and the right to life of our judges, reporters, political
leaders, union members, peasants and office holders.''
   A kilogram equals 2.2 pounds.
   The seven presidents, seated at a long table on the stage of a
municipal auditorium in this Atlantic resort town, all made short
opening speeches. They then headed to the countryside for a
traditional Uruguayan ``asado,'' or barbecue, before going into
their first round of closed-door meetings.
   A joint communique was to be issued on Saturday.
   The presidents gave little indication what specific proposals
might emerge in the communique. No president in his speech called
for drastic, one-sided action such as withholding debt interest
payments or linking repayments to a fixed figure, such as a
percentage of export earnings.
   Foreign ministers of the member countries endorsed in April 1987
a proposal by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica that called for
disarming warring factions in Nicaragua and El Salvador and a policy
of non-intervention by the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Argentine President Raul Alfonsin said he was encouraged by the
group's progress during the past two years. ``We are a new and
necessary political personality on the world stage,'' he said.

   A bus from Dan Quayle's motorcade
collided Thursday with a school van carrying five children, but
witnesses said there were no serious injuries.
   The vice presidential candidate was not aboard the campaign staff
bus when it smashed into the side of the van, said Rep. Jim Courter,
R-N.J., who was on it along with Quayle's aunt and mother and aides
to Quayle.
   ``We're fine,'' said Quayle's mother, Corinne.
   Courter said the school bus driver appeared ``very shaken up.''
Police and ambulance crews tended to the children at the scene.
   Three students _ two girls and a boy _ and a driver were taken to
nearby Morristown Memorial Hospital for treatment of bumps and
bruises and other minor injuries.
   Quayle took time to visit the students, all in their early teens,
and said afterward ``they were all in very good spirits.''
   Courter said the school bus ``pulled right out in front of us.''
The motorcade, under police escort, was driving through stop lights
and signs, he said.
   Quayle, in a limousine ahead of the bus with New Jersey Gov.
Thomas H. Kean and New Jersey GOP Senate candidate Peter Dawkins, at
first continued on, apparently unaware of the accident.
   The accident occurred at 3:30 p.m. while the Quayle motorcade was
en route from Morristown Municipal Airport to a campaign appearance.

   In the closing days of the
presidential race, George Bush keeps telling audiences ``I'm running
like I'm 10 points behind.'' Actually, he's running the
play-it-safe, no-surprises campaign of a front-runner.
   Major polls indicate Bush is well ahead of Democratic rival
Michael Dukakis. And Bush is not tampering with what has proven to
be a successful formula of bashing Dukakis as a diehard liberal who
is weak on crime, soft on defense and apt to raise taxes.
   ``This election is far from over,'' Bush told an audience of
several hundred people at a stockyard rally in Sioux Falls, S.D.
``You've seen those national surveys but let me tell you something.
I am going to continue to run like I am 10 points behind, right down
to the wire, standing on the issues.
   Bush added, ``I am determined to win this election. I am not
going to let up. I am not going to refuse to campaign. I'll keep
going as far and as fast as is required.''
   At the same time, he's apparently also working to maximize
Republican chances in several races for the Senate, where Democrats
are trying to protect their current 54-46 advantage.
   He's visiting Nebraska on Saturday, a state where he holds a huge
lead over Dukakis but where GOP Sen. David Karnes trails in his
re-election bid.
   He went to Montana on Wednesday, where he's in a close race but
for a payoff of only four electoral votes. Republican Senate
challenger Conrad Burns is trailing narrowly in private GOP surveys
there.
   And Bush's stop in Washington on Thursday was designed not only
to boost his own chances in a tight state, but also to help Senate
candidate Slade Gorton, who is also locked in a tight race.
   Bush acknowledges he's not going to try anything new in the
homestretch of the campaign, and he hasn't. He'll ``probably keep
talking about the same themes that he's been talking about,'' said
Craig Fuller, who is Bush's chief of staff.
   Among the states where Bush is making appearances this week are
Ohio, Michigan, California and Illinois _ electoral giants crucial
to the outcome of the Nov. 8 contest.
   ``We're going to focus on states where we think the support is
soft, where the margin isclose,'' said Fuller.
   ``We're pleased and encouraged by the polls but we are going to
continue to work to make sure we've locked up the necessary
electoral votes,'' Fuller said.
   Yet, Bush also shows up in places like Williston, Vt., where he
told a firehouse rally, ``Things look pretty good nationally.''
   The very fact that he was spending time in Vermont, which offers
a total of just three electoral votes, suggests Bush is not worrying
too much. He could have spent that time in big battleground states.
   Bush also went to Connecticut (8 electoral votes), South Dakota
(3) and Montana (4). Not because he needed them, but at least partly
because they are states in Michael Dukakis' calculus of how to win
the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House.
   ``Why not wreak havoc with that stratgy?'' said Rich Bond, Bush's
national political director and deputy campaign manager. ``He
(Dukakis) has to take some states out of our political base and I
would be hard-pressed to name one.''
   Talking about his visit to Billings, Mont., after a stop earlier
in the day in Sioux Falls, Bush said, ``It shows that we are taking
absolutely nothing for granted.''
   At a strategy meeting after the Oct. 13 presidential debate in
Los Angeles, Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III told the
senior staff that their biggest problem was to avoid overconfidence.
   Nevertheless, While Dukakis was busy on the campaign trail last
Sunday, Bush was resting at home in Washington. So, too, was his
running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle.
   Tentative plans call for Bush to be in Washington again this
Sunday, relaxing for the final eight-day push.
   Uncharacteristically, Bush made an effort in one speech this week
to respond briefly to Dukakis' charges of lies and distortions in
GOP campaign advertisements. Usually, Bush just ignores Duckakis'
attacks.
   Having dealt with the issue once, Bush quickly turned the job of
responding over to a team of campaign advisers at a Washington news
conference.
   Unlike Dukakis, Bush turned down an invitation to appear on a
90-minute session of ABC's ``Nightline.'' Bush also has ignored
similar interview bids from CBS and NBC, which were grabbed up by
Dukakis. Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate says the CBS and NBC offers
are good until the election but she doubts the vice president will
accept them.
   Borrowing a chapter from President Reagan's campaign book, Bush
has largely insulated himself from the press, minimizing chances for
miscues and gaffes that would detract from his campaign message.
   Typically Bush makes three campaign appearances a day. The first
event usually is the one that provides the latest twist on a
well-worn book of political rhetoric and attack lines.
   The second and third events of the day usually are rallies where
Bush delivers his time-tested stump speech with lines such as, ``The
liberal governor is simply out of step with the American people. My
values are your values.''
   Bush quickly follows up by attacking Dukakis on hot-button
issues: gun control, the death penalty, abortion, the Pledge of
Allegiance, and Dukakis' membership in the American Civil Liberties
Union.

   Israeli soldiers killed a teen-ager and wounded
20 other Palestinians during street confrontations Thursday in the
occupied lands, hospital officials and Arab journalists reported.
   Officials at Shifa hospital in Gaza City said 16-year-old Zyad
Sabit was shot in the heart at the Nuseirat refugee camp.
   At least 304 Palestinians and six Israelis have died since a
rebellion against Israeli occupation began last Dec. 8 among the 1.5
million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel
captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in
the 1967 war.
   The immediate cause of violence in Gaza was the death Wednesday
of a 3-year-old whose parents said she was suffocated by tear gas.
The army however said Narin Jihad An-Nahajha died of pneumonia.
   Dozens of young Palestinians set tires ablaze and threw stones at
Israeli soldiers in Khan Yunis, where Narin died. Troops responded
with plastic bullets, wounding three teen-agers and three women,
said officials at Nasser hospital in the city.
   Plastic bullets wounded two Palestinians during a stone-throwing
melee on Palestine Street in Gaza City, hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed three wounded in Khan Yunis and a spokesman
said he was aware ``there could be more casualties. It wasn't quiet
today in Gaza.''
   But Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, toured Gaza
and said ``today is a nice day, quiet.''
   ``Let's return to proportion: There are no riots in the strip, no
possibility for riots,'' Shomron said on Israel radio. ``When a
child dies in the Gaza Strip, rumors abound and heat the tempers.''
   Journalists in Nablus, largest city in the West Bank, said young
Arabs attacked soldiers with stones and bottles in a protest called
by underground Palestinian leaders of an Israeli demand that car
owners buy expensive new license plates identifying their city of
residence.
   Soldiers responded with tear gas and live ammunition, wounding
seven Palestinians aged 14 to 27, said officials at Al-Ittihad and
St. John's hospitals.
   Arab reports said hundreds of cars and trucks blocked roads in
response to loudspeaker appeals for vehicles to stop at 9 a.m. to
protest the order to purchase the new plates, which cost the
equivalent of about $250.
   Five Palestinians were reported wounded in Jenin, Tulkarem and
Idna in the West Bank.
   The army command confirmed five casualties in Nablus and said it
was checking the other reports.

   The nation's 60,000 striking public
employees defied a presidential back-to-work order Thursday, workers
at U.S.-owned banana plantations began a sympathy walkout and
students boycotted classes.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo declared the strike illegal and
offered the workers better benefits, which they turned down. It is
the first nationwide strike by public employees in this Central
American country of 5 million people.
   Soldiers guarded closed government offices but the military said
it would not use force against the workers, who began the strike
Wednesday.
   Government hospitals were closed and only about 40 percent of
buses and taxis were operating.
   Secondary school and university students cut classes and 8,000
workers stayed away from their jobs at two banana plantations owned
by the United Brands fruit company.
   Azcona ordered the strikers back to work after an emergency
Cabinet meeting. The Association of Public Employees said Azcona's
offer was inadequate. Association president Carlos Obdulio Chevez
told reporters the strike would continue until all union demands
were met.
   The workers want raises, paid vacations, job security, Christmas
bonuses and an extra month's pay every year. The union has not said
how large the raises should be for its members, who now are paid an
average $500 a month.
   Azcona appeared caught between the strikers and a legislature
hostile to their demands. He offered job security and paid vacations
but Carlos Montoya, president of the legislature, said Azcona had no
business promising something he could not deliver.
   In order to meet the strikers' demands, Montoya said, Honduras
would have to devalue its currency, levy new taxes, accept higher
inflation and get a loan from the International Monetary Fund.
   The United States has more than 1,000 soldiers stationed in
Honduras, a staunch ally and recipient of substantial U.S. military
aid.

   Michael Dukakis' campaign said Thursday it is
doubling its budget for Hispanic ads, with most of the money
earmarked for a radio blitz in seven states with large and still
fluid Hispanic voter populations.
   The announcement from Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., heading the
Democratic presidential nominee's drive for Hispanic votes, came the
same day Jesse Jackson began urging a vote for Dukakis in spots on
radio stations with black listeners.
   The Dukakis campaign is spending about $3 million _ 10 percent of
its media budget _ on black-oriented television and radio
advertising which began three weeks ago. Jackson has recorded five
radio ads.
   ``We have the power to make Mike Dukakis president. Let's use
it,'' he says in one of them. ``More people have fallen into the
deep hole of poverty because of Republican policies,'' he says in
another.
   Dukakis, who is fluent in Spanish, started running TV ads in
Spanish on two national Hispanic networks, Univision and Telemundo,
last week. One stresses education, another drugs and a third his
immigrant heritage. All three end with the tagline, ``He speaks our
language.''
   Richardson said Thursday the Hispanic ad budget will be expanded
from $500,000 to $1 million. He said three-quarters of the new money
will go for radio saturation in Texas, California, New Mexico,
Colorado, Illinois, New York and New Jersey. The three new spots
were scheduled to start Friday.
   The Dukakis campaign believes Hispanics can provide the margin of
victory Nov. 8 if they turn out in force and vote Democratic. But
Republican George Bush is counting on Cuban-American support in
Florida and is not ceding Hispanic votes elsewhere.
   The new Dukakis radio offensive does not include Florida, where
Bush holds a huge lead and Richardson said Dukakis has had trouble
making inroads with Cuban-American voters.
   And Bush was scheduled Friday to receive the endorsement of El
Informador Hispano, a Hispanic newspaper in Fort Worth. The
endorsement editorial praised Bush for being ``tough on crime and
drug dealers.'' It also says that ``like most Hispanics, he believes
abortion is wrong except in case of rape or danger to the mother's
life.''
   Bush is running a Texas TV ad featuring his Hispanic
daughter-in-law Columba, who is married to his son Jeb, and the
couple's three children. The ad, running in both English and
Spanish, concludes with the vice president saying he'll ``have a lot
of reasons to help Hispanics everywhere, because I'll not only be
answering to my grandchildren, I'll be answering to history.''
   In other media developments:
   _Four new Dukakis spots unveiled earlier this week, combining a
populist ``on your side'' pitch with the vow that ``the best America
is yet to come,'' started Thursday in spot markets across the
country.
   _The California Democratic Party said it had begun airing two ads
aimed at turning out younger voters for the Democratic ticket. The
spots in markets around the state attack the GOP record on education
and the environment.
   _Bush spokesman Mark Goodin said the campaign had temporarily
shelved a 60-second version of a 30-second ``tank'' ad mocking
Dukakis' tank ride photo opportunity as a narrator lists weapons
systems allegedly opposed by the Democrat. Goodin called the
expanded version ``devastating'' and said Bush, who holds a
double-digit lead in most polls, would not bring out the ``heavy
artillery'' unless it is needed.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa demanded
Thursday that talks between the government and opposition begin
without preconditions and called on the authorities to clarify the
prospects for union pluralism.
   ``We demand that talks begin without preconditions and without
intervention, but we cannot open the talks at any price,'' Walesa
said at a news conference.
   Walesa met earlier with three of his most senior Solidarity
advisers, one of whom expressed doubt over the future of the talks,
which are to consider the future of the banned union and broader
issues of political and economic reform.
   ``I must say that today I am very pessimistic. I could say that
perhaps the round table is over without a start. But you know that
in all countries everything can change,'' said Andrzej
Stelmachowski, a law professor and opposition mediator.
   Government objections to two members of the Solidarity delegation
delayed the start of the talks. But Walesa said again Thursday he
would not change his team.
   Walesa on Tuesday refused a government demand he meet with
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak to clear final obstacles to
the talks. The government said they could begin Friday if Walesa
agreed to meet Kiszczak.
   Stelmachowski said Kiszczak was asked Thursday to make a
statement declaring the government's intentions on the prospects for
pluralism and the future of Solidarity.
   ``This morning they refused to make such a declaration. The
situation is very bad,'' Stelmachowski said.
   Walesa noted a change in the authorities' attitude toward the
talks. ``I see a lack of political will to solve the problems that
divide us.'' he said.
   He agreed to take part in the talks at a meeting with Kiszczak on
Aug. 31 while strikes continued in Poland's worst labor unrest in
seven years.
   After being guaranteed the talks would include the subject of
Solidarity's future, Walesa called a halt to the strikes. He had
joined striking workers at the Gdansk shipyard during the first
strike wave in April and again in August.
   Walesa accused the authorities of bad faith by failing to
reinstate more than 100 miners fired in the Silesia region after
strikes in mid-August.
   The official news agency PAP carried an Interior Ministry
statement saying Kiszczak had urged managements to rehire dismissed
workers and asked prosecutors to drop proceedings against strike
leaders.
   It said he was ``urgently'' collecting information about
individual cases brought to his attention by the Roman Catholic
Church.
   ``This proves that no `political repressions' are being used .. .
and the appeals of Gen. Kiszczak are being gradually implemented,''
the ministry declared.
   In response to questions, Walesa said more strikes are possible
unless the workers are rehired and the promise of round-table talks
is fulfilled.
   ``People who were fighting then are ready now again,'' he said.
``I am ready to jump over the fence for the third time although we
don't want it.''
   Walesa also complained about government attempts to interfere in
the composition of Solidarity's delegation.
   The government has objected to the participation of regime
critics Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron, whom it says do not respect
Poland's constitutional order which guarantees a ``leading role'' of
the communist party.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban on Tuesday called on the two men
to publically declare their respect for the constitutional order.
Walesa has refused to drop the two men from his team.
   Walesa met Thurdsay with historian Bronislaw Geremek and
journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki in addition to Stelmachowski.
   The advisers say it seems the real obstacle is not the
particpants, but the authorities' lack of clarity on the future of
Solidarity.
   ``What Walesa said at the beginning means all the problems are
blocked because there is no answer to the basic question. It's not
the pretext, but the question of the lack of political will to solve
the central problem of the legalization of Solidarity,'' Geremek
said.
   Walesa and his advisers appear worried that chances for the talks
are diminishing as time elapses.
   ``We have no time and we don't want empty words ... Talks are
already late.'' Walesa said.
   A communique earlier this week said the Politburo was committed
to the talks and expressed hope that ``remaining controversies will
be quickly removed in the course of preparatory talks.''
   Urban's office did not return a phone call requesting comment on
the future of the talks.

   Two convicted murderers held hostage a
counselor and a teacher's aide at a state prison for several hours
Thursday in an attempt to get transferred to another prison,
authorities said.
   Both hostages were released unharmed and the inmates, armed with
sharpened metal rods, surrendered peacefully, said Capt. Robert
Baker of the state Department of Corrections.
   Annette Martin, 46, a teaching assistant, and Joan Mason, 51, a
vocational counselor, both of Newark, were taken hostage at 9:07
a.m. as they conducted a teaching demonstration in the library of
the year-old Northern State Prison.
   Mrs. Martin was released at 1:34 p.m. and Ms. Mason was taken
from the library on a stretcher at 4:06 p.m., ending nearly seven
hours as a hostage.
   Negotiators spent hours talking through a metal mesh window to
the inmates, who used the women as shields.
   ``There were repeated threats that they were prepared to do
violence to the hostages,'' said Gary Hilton, deputy corrections
commissioner. He said the women were ``emotionally battered'' but
not physically harmed.
   The only demands from inmates Angel Guzman, 26, and Edward
Robinson, 27, were that they be transferred to a federal prison
outside New Jersey and that officials take no reprisals for the
hostage taking, said Corrections spokesman James Stabile.
   ``The negotiators agreed that the grievances of the two inmates
would be reviewed,'' Hilton said. Robinson also asked to be allowed
to call his mother, a demand Hilton said would be granted.
   He said Guzman and Robinson will be transferred Thursday to
another state prison.
   Mrs. Martin's husband, Isaac, said in a telephone interview that
he learned of his wife's plight from a noon radio broadcast. ``I
just had to pray that it would come to a happy ending,'' Martin said.
   Hilton described the inmates as longtime friends who had been
imprisoned at Riverfront State Prison in Camden before being
transferred to Northern State Prison about two weeks ago.
   Guzman of Woodbine was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 1982
for murdering his uncle during an argument over $70. Robinson of
Camden was sentenced to life in prison in 1979 for shooting his
victim in the back of the head. Prison records did not give details
of the case.
   Northern State Prison is a medium security prison that holds
about 1,000 inmates in six two-story units. The $18 million complex
opened in May 1987.
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who went to the prison after learning
of the hostage taking, said he was unaware that the lockup housed
murderers. The state has two maximum security prisons near Rahway
and Trenton.
   Hilton said it was not unusual for murderers to be kept at a
medium security prison.

<HEAD>Business Executive Says Deficit Panel Leans Toward $120 Billion
Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Strauss, co-chairman of the National
Economic Commission, has told business executives that he believes
his panel will support a $120 billion deficit reduction package
split evenly between budget cuts and increased taxes, one of the
executives said Thursday.
   John Sloan, president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, said Strauss told the business leaders at a dinner in New
York City on Wednesday that ``he thinks he has nine votes'' on the
12-member commission for a combination of $60 billion in government
spending cuts and $60 billion in tax increases to close the budget
gap.
   However, James Hildreth, a spokesman for the commission, quoted
Strauss as terming Sloan's version of the meeting ``totally
inaccurate.''
   ``All he said at the dinner was that the most support he could
hope to get for any program would probably be eight or nine votes
out of the current 12 members,'' Hildreth said. ``But he denies
saying in any way, shape or form what the final package will be.''
   The commission was created by Congress to come up with
recommendations on eliminating the federal budget deficit, which
totaled an estimated $150 billion for the fiscal year which ended
Sept. 30.
   The commission hopes to begin taking votes on different options
after the Nov. 8 election when the president-elect will name the
final two members to the panel. The panel has set a deadline of
finishing its work by Dec. 21.
   Sloan, president of an association of 500,000 small businesses,
told reporters at a briefing Thursday that Strauss had indicated he
believed the commission would approve a deficit reduction package
amounting to $120 billion split evenly between increased taxes and
budget cuts.
   Sloan said Strauss said he personally supported a vale added tax
as a way of raising revenues.
   The VAT, which has been adopted by several European countries, is
a form of sales tax. The tax is added to a product at various stages
of the production process. A 5 percent value added tax could raise
an estimated $50 billion in new revenues annually.
   Sloan said his group was adamantly opposed to a VAT, in part
because of the added paperwork burdens involved in administering
such a tax.
   However, he said he believed it would be one of the options the
commission would seriously consider because of the strong backing it
has among lobbyists for big corporations who believe such a tax
would ease the pressure on Congress to boost corporate taxes.
   But Hildreth said Strauss has not expressed any preferences for a
VAT or any other type of tax.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis drew
inspiration from ``that feisty little guy'' Harry Truman on Thursday
and charged George Bush with trying to masquerade a tax break for
the rich as a jobs program.
   The Democratic presidential nominee invoked Truman's battling
underdog memory across the Midwest as he pressed his argument that
Bush is an elitist whose proposal to reduce the federal tax on
capital gains would benefit primarily the wealthy.
   ``He said it was a jobs program,'' Dukakis said. ``Who's he
kidding?
   ``What are they going to do with the extra money? Hire a second
butler? A lifeguard for the pool?''
   Dukakis spoke to supporters in the Chicago suburb of Evergreen
Park, Ill., and in Machesney Park outside Rockford, Ill., before
flying to Kansas City, Mo., for a live interview on the CBS Evening
News.
   The interview was part of Dukakis' effort to revive his
struggling campaign by taking advantage of opportunities to speak
directly to the voters through television. He was also taping an
interview with David Frost to appear later.
   He had a question-and-answer session with citizens in
Independence, Mo., hometown of the late former president whose
victory in the 1948 election over Republican Thomas Dewey confounded
the pollsters.
   ``We're going to Kansas City and then to Independence to draw
inspiration from that feisty little guy,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Harry Truman was a fighter and so am I and so are you,'' he
said. ``The Republicans are trying to do in this campaign exactly
what they tried to do to Harry Truman and Jack Kennedy _ distort the
record, try to put labels on people. But we're not going to let them
do it.''
   Dukakis, after several days of discouraging polls, appeared
energized by large, enthusiastic crowds and by a reunion with his
wife Kitty, who had been campaigning separately for several days.
   Bush's tax proposal has become an object of Dukakis' scorn at
every campaign stop, as he depicts it as providing a $30,000 tax
break for someone making more than $200,000 a year _ although the
benefit would depend on an individual's capital gains, such as
profits from the sale of stock or property.
   He focused on Bush's assertion a day earlier that a reduction in
the maximum rate on capital gains to 15 percent would encourage the
investment of capital and thus create jobs.
   Dukakis said the proposal was ``Halloween come early _ a treat
for the wealthiest 1 percent and a trick for the rest of us.''
   ``That's not the way we're going to create good quality jobs in
this country,'' Dukakis said.
   ``This is classic Republican trickle-down economics,'' he said.
``Give the people at the top the money and hope a few crumbs fall
off the table for the rest of us.''
   Dukakis aides distributed a statement saying Bush's claims for
the tax cut ``grow more fantastic'' and calling his assertion ``a
lie.'' Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach later said the
campaign based its statement on an Associated Press report Wednesday.
   That report erroneously quoted Bush as saying ``most capital
gains are realized by people who earn less than $50,000 a year,'' a
statement about the value of gains realized rather than the number
of people claiming such gains. In fact, Bush said ``the majority of
capital gains recipients earn less than $50,000 a year, and the cut
will create jobs.''
   In Illinois, Dukakis leveled new criticism at Bush for a
regulatory relief task force that the vice president headed and
which Dukakis said sought to roll back worker safety regulations. He
cited the death of a chemical worker after the task force ``told
OSHA to ease up on the kind of inspections being made in plants like
his.''
   ``And they talk about `a kinder, gentler nation,''' Dukakis said,
using a favorite Bush line. ``In a Dukakis-Bentsen admininstration,
we're going to put safety first and people first.''

   The U.S. decision to rebuild its embassy in Moscow
is based on unsubstantiated charges that the facility is riddled
with listening devices, the official Soviet news agency said
Thursday.
   Tass said in a dispatch from Washington that both countries will
suffer because opening new embassies in both capitals will be
delayed.
   Earlier Thursday, President Reagan said he recommended that the
new U.S. Embassy in Moscow be razed and rebuilt ``because there's no
way to rid it of the many listening devices that were built into
it.''
   ``We're going to start and have an American-built one,'' Reagan
said of the embassy.
   Tass, in the first Soviet reaction to the U.S. decision, said the
spying allegations were unproven.
   ``The Soviet side was again presented with groundless, obviously
far-fetched charges of ... U.S. state sovereignty having been
outraged,'' the news agency said.
   ``Just as in previous cases, however, the U.S. administration did
not provide any material proof to back up those claims this time as
well.''
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman repeatedly
declined to tell reporters what devices the United States discovered
in the new structure or how they were installed because ``it's never
in anyone's interest to let the other guy know what you know.''
   Tass said the American taxpayer will suffer because of the extra
cost of rebuilding the Moscow diplomatic outpost.
   Without giving figures, Redman said tearing down the existing
structure and building a new one under high security conditions will
involve ``a very elaborate and costly process.''
   U.S. inspectors first discovered eavesdropping bugs, in
structural elements built by Soviet workers and transported to the
site, in the spring of 1987. The United States and the Soviet Union
agreed in 1972 to build new, larger embassies in each other's
capital.

   Leftist guerrillas exploded bombs and
attacked a naval base and a police station during a general strike
Thursday, but millions of workers went to their jobs.
   One man was killed when a bomb exploded in the office of a
leftist party that supported the one-day strike, said the minister
of defense, Gen. Rafael Samudio.
   Workers clung to the outside of the few packed buses that
continued to operate and clambered into government trucks and army
vehicles to get to work.
   Labor Minister Juan Martin Caicedo said an estimated 97 percent
of workers showed up for their jobs despite the strike, called by
the three largest labor unions.
   He said he was surprised by the display of ``democracy and
sensibility.''
   Guerrillas attacked the police station and naval base in the
northern town of Turbo at 2 a.m., but the assault was repulsed and
no one was injured, the Defense Ministry said. It did not say how
many guerrillas attacked.
   Rebels elsewhere blew up electric lines, railway tracks and a
bridge, Gen Samudio said.
   All of Colombia's 300,000 policemen and soldiers were ordered to
duty during the strike. Armored cars and jeeps mounted with machine
guns patrolled streets.
   Samudio said the fatal bomb exploded in the offices of the
Patriotic Union party at Apartado in the banana-growing north.
   The area has been plagued with violence. Guerrillas attacked four
towns this week and ordered townspeople to support the strike.
   Right-wing death squads have killed more than 100 peasants in the
six months in the area, where labor unions are active among
plantation workers.
   It appeared only about 10 percent of the businesses in downtown
Bogota, a city of 6 million people, were closed for the strike.
   The Caribbean resort city of Cartagena was without electricity
Thursday because guerrillas blew up an electricity tower, the
national police said.
   Guerrillas also blew up a power pylon in the northwest city of
Medellin and rail lines in Medellin and Bogota, but no one was hurt,
police said.
   The unions called the strike to demand higher wages, lower
inflation, a price freeze on basic foods and government action
against right-wing death squads.
   Colombia's minimum wage is about $90 a month and inflation has
been running at an annual rate of 22 percent this year.
   Rightist death squads have killed 800 people in last two years,
including about 180 union members.
   The three unions, whose 800,000 members are only about 10 percent
of Colombia's workers, are the Workers' Unitary Central, General
Confederation of Labor and the Colombian Confederation of Workers.

<HEAD>Agency Approves 20 Percent Pay Bonus at Hard-to-Staff Airports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration received
permission Thursday to offer pay bonuses next year to air traffic
controllers and other personnel at hard-to-staff facilities in
Chicago, New York and Los Angeles.
   The Office of Personnel Management has approved what the FAA
described as a ``demonstration project'' testing whether incentives
will attract qualified employees to unattractive assignments.
   About 2,000 FAA employees in the three metropolitan areas will be
eligible to receive an additional allowance of up to 20 percent of
their basic pay under the five-year test program, Transportation
Secretary James Burnley said.
   The FAA cited bonuses as part of its plans to ease pressure on
overworked controllers at the nation's busiest airport, O'Hare
International in Chicago.
   O'Hare controllers have had 30 flight-handling errors this year
compared with 12 mistakes in all of 1987 and their previous record
of 22 in 1986.
   ``This project should make it possible for the FAA to achieve
full staffing at facilities where living costs, highly complex
operations or other factors have made them less attractive locations
for employees to move to,'' Burnley said.
   The law under which OPM approved the bonuses requires a 180-day
waiting period to give Congress time to review its decision, so the
incentives cannot begin until May, said the agency's director,
Constance Horner.
   However, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said he would introduce
legislation in January to waive the waiting period because more
experienced controllers are needed at O'Hare.
   More than 60 percent of the employees eligible for the bonus pay
will be controllers, the FAA said. The rest are safety inspectors
and the technicians who service and maintain air-traffic control
computers and other equipment.
   The FAA said facilities chosen for incentives include air route
traffic control centers at Chicago and New York, control towers and
terminal radar approach control centers at O'Hare and Los Angeles
International Airport, terminal radar approach centers at New York
and Santa Anna, Calif., and flight standards district offices at Los
Angeles; Farmingdale, N.Y.; Valley Stream, N.Y.; and Teterboro, N.J.

   The American-Soviet rescue of two whales off Alaska
was an example of superpower cooperation that should include helping
people, government spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Thursday.
   Two Soviet icebreakers cut a channel in thick ice off northern
Alaska on Wednesday, allowing the whales to start their long journey
to their winter home off Baja California.
   Millions of Soviets learned of the success on the evening
television news program Vremya, which has covered the story for at
least a week.
   In a report sandwiched between news of sports and the weather, an
announcer said:
   ``And one more piece of news: Soviet ships, with the assistance
of American specialists and numerous volunteers, freed two gray
California whales who had been taken prisoners of ice off the shores
of Alaska.''
   Television showed the whales swimming freely, the Soviet
icebreakers and helicopters overhead.
   The announcer then said the whales had stopped moving, apparently
because slivers of ice blocked their way, and the Soviet ships would
try to clear the channel Friday.
   U.S. officials said the whales still were some distance from open
sea, in the path cleared by the icebreakers Admiral Makarov and
Vladimir Arseniev.
   At an earlier news briefing that focused on the weightier matters
of arms control and civil war in Afghanistan, Gerasimov turned
attention to the whales.
   ``The United States and us, we've saved those unfortunate
whales,'' he said. ``There's now a path broken down in the ice and
we hope that the whales will go the way they're supposed to, that is
towards the Gulf of Mexico, the coast of Mexico, although the
reports show that they now seem to be very dependent on the
foodstuffs they get there.''
   While reporters chuckled, he praised the international rescue as
an example of superpower cooperation.
   ``We've done all we could to save them, and it would be good if
the United States and the Soviet Union acted in such a concerted way
when what's involved is the saving of human life,'' Gerasimov said.
   The concern for the whales is a change of position for the Soviet
Union, which killed hundreds of the mammals in violation of
international agreements.
   In April, the Soviets followed up on informal pledges and
officially notified the United States it had stopped commerical
whaling. The International Whaling Commission, to which the Soviet
Union belongs, ordered commercial killing of whales to stop in 1986.

   A Superior Court judge has rejected former Gov.
Edward J. King's request for a new trial in his unsuccessful libel
suit against The Boston Globe.
   Judge James P. Lynch Jr. said he denied the motion Monday.
   The newspaper and columnist David Farrell were cleared last month
of libeling King after a two-week trial.
   The 16-member jury ruled that a November 1981 political column
claiming that King telephoned a judge and demanded a change in a
controversial gang-rape sentence was wrong but did not constitute
libel.
   King can appeal Lynch's refusal directly to the state Appeals
Court, a move his attorney said he was considering. Globe spokesman
Rick Gulla said the newspaper had not seen the decision and would
not comment until it has.

<TEXT>
   NATO's defense ministers tried to
unravel a snag in talks Thursday after Belgium balked at joining a
call for modernizing short-range nuclear weapons.
   The recommendation is contained in a report prepared by
high-level defense officials from NATO nations. The study details a
continuing need for short-range nuclear arms now that the
superpowers have agreed to scrap medium-range nuclear weapons.
   In December, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. That pact will eliminate
in three years all U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges
from about 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   Officials said participants at this week's talks were trying to
gain Belgian endorsement of the classified report presented to U.S.
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and defense chiefs from 14 other
nations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They were meeting
at a resort outside The Hague, Netherlands.
   Belgian Defense Minister Guy Coeme told a Belgian radio station
Wednesday night he intended ``to ring the alarm bell'' about the
report.
   Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans said in an interview with a
Brussels daily the report might set the stage for a final decision
to moderize short-range nuclear arms. ``I think we can wait with
that,'' he said.
   Dan Plesch, director of the British American Security Information
Council, said the report by high-level defense officials was
worrisome.
   ``Just when you thought you were safe (with the
intermediate-range treaty), along comes a lot more missiles and the
idea that you can have limited nuclear war,'' he said.
   The issue of modernizing short-range weapons is controversial in
Europe, where critics argue the weapons would likely be used on
their soil because of their range under 300 miles.
   However, several ministers at the talks said Thursday that
Belgium's objections were minor and that it would eventually approve
the report.
   British Defense Minister George Younger said the Belgian position
was ``extraordinarily close to the other positions.''
   A summary of the report, made available by the Security
Information Council, said it outlined several options for
restructuring NATO's nuclear forces.
   Copies of the summary also were released by the Campaign fpr
Nuclear Disarmament, based in London, which opposes nuclear weapons
and led the fight against deploying medium-range missiles in Britain.
   Efforts to reach Belgian officials for comment were not
successful.
   The report generally recommends a continued role in NATO strategy
of short-range nuclear forces.
   It calls for continuing support for U.S. and British efforts to
develop a new, longer range tactical air-to-surface missile that
could be fired at Soviet air defenses from fighter planes.
   The report also backs U.S. efforts to develop a replacement for
the Lance surface-to-surface nuclear missile, which military
analysts say will be obsolete by 1995.
   The defense ministers gather twice a year to discuss nuclear
strategy. Fourteen of NATO's 16 members take part, with Iceland
attending as an observer. France operates outside NATO's military
structure.
   No final decision on modernization of the weapons was expected
until next year at the earliest, officials said.

   Vice President George Bush said
Thursday the political spin doctors may have gone too far and said
he'd heard that the city of Boston tried to use them to convince
reporters that the Red Sox beat the Oakland Athletics in the
American League playoffs.
   In fact, Oakland won four straight games and then lost the World
Series to Los Angeles.
   ``Some of the modern campaigning with television and spinning and
sound bites may have gotten out of hand,'' the Republican
presidential nominee said in a speech at Applied Materials Corp. ``I
heard that after the playoffs the city of Boston sent spin doctors
out for the media, trying to convince them that they had beaten
Oakland. It doesn't work.
   ``The American people are smart, they can see through to the real
issues on their own somehow.''

<HEAD>Child Injured by Lawn Dart Kept in Coma; Congress Voted to Ban Game
Last Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old girl accidentally stabbed
in the forehead by a lawn dart was kept comatose Thursday as her
doctors waited for swelling in her brain to subside.
   Amy Herrin of McMinnville was in critical condition in the
pediatric intensive care unit of Vanderbilt University Medical
Center after eight hours of surgery to remove and repair damage
caused by the 1-pound steel and plastic dart.
   ``They've been keeping her asleep,'' Amy's mother, Sue Tucker,
said Thursday. ``They didn't want the brain to do any functioning on
its own till they found out whether or not the brain was going to
swell. It's just wait and see how things are and do a lot of
praying.''
   The girl was injured Tuesday evening as she played the
horseshoe-like game with a cousin outside a neighbor's house. The
object of the game is to toss the darts, which have 4-inch-long
metal points, into a ring placed on the ground.
   The accident came after Congress passed legislation last week
ordering the government to ban the sale of lawn darts, a game that
is blamed for the deaths of three children and injuries to thousands
of others.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission was ordered to prohibit
sale of the darts within 60 days unless it determines that the game
cannot cause puncture wounds. It was to consider the matter at a
meeting Friday.
   Mrs. Tucker said the cousin raced into her kitchen at about 5:30
p.m., followed by Amy, with the dart still protruding from her head.
   ``She just said, `Momma, it's in my head.' All else I remember is
me screaming,'' Mrs. Tucker said.
   The girl has suffered some brain damage but doctors don't know
how much, said Amy's stepfather, Lamar Tucker. He said she faces
more surgery.
   Surgeons had to cut into her skull to get the dart out, Tucker
said, ``and they're going to have to go back in and put in a plate
in her forehead.''
   The cousin who threw the dart ``was real tore up,'' Mrs. Tucker
said. ``He came down (to the hospital) with his mother and dad. He's
only 11 years old. He brought (Amy) ... flowers and a big balloon.''
   Federal law currently requires that the darts carry warning
labels stating the game is not for children and can cause serious
injury or death. They are not to be sold in toy stores or in toy
departments.
   ``No toy could do the damage that's been done to my baby,'' Mrs.
Tucker said.

   Legislator Micha Reisser, a top candidate for
the right-wing Likud bloc in next week's parliamentary elections,
died Thursday of injuries sustained in a car accident, hospital
officials said. He was 42.
   Reisser served two terms in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
Under the Israeli voting system, his being placed 25th in the Likud
list of candidates for Tuesday's election assured his re-election.
   Reisser was injured in an accident Wednesday on the Tel
Aviv-Jerusalem highway and died Thursday night after three
operations, said Ruth Mekel, spokeswoman of Jerusalem's Hadassah
Hospital.
   Witnesses said Reisser's driver tried to avoid a truck, veered
into the opposite lane and struck an oncoming car.
   Reisser is survived by his wife and three children. His funeral
was scheduled for 12:30 p.m. Friday in Kiryat Shaul.

<HEAD>U.S. Citizens Group Says U.S.-U.N. Relations in Disarray</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading U.S. citizens group on the
United Nations said Thursday that the world body is in need of major
changes and that the next administration in Washington should make
U.N. reform a top priority.
   The report released by the United Nations Association of the
United States and its chairman, Elliot L. Richardson, lamented that
U.S.-U.N. relations are in disarray and urged the next
administration to pay U.S. arrears of more than $400 million.
   ``With the U.N. enjoying renewed credibility as it brings some of
the world's most bitter conflicts to an end ... the prospects for
U.N. purposeful global action ... are brighter than at any time in
recent history,'' it said. ``A new realism in both the Third World
and the Soviet Union has created new opportunities for international
cooperation in the U.N. _ but also America's own relations with the
U.N. are in disarray,'' Richardson, a former U.S. attorney general
and defense secretary, noted in the report.
   The disarray results from U.S. nonpayment and withholding of its
budget dues, which the United States is legally obliged to pay.
   In addition, the Reagan administration has been estranged from
the organization for nearly eight years, accusing it of anti-Western
bias, a bloated bureaucracy and wasteful spending. Reagan has balked
at giving up any U.S. prerogatives to act for itself in favor of
multilateral solutions.
   The administration acknowledged, however, that the 159-member
world body has instituted major reforms and made dramatic
contributions to conflict resolution, from Afghanistan to the
Iran-Iraq war.
   The United Nations Association of the United States is a
nonpartisan, nationwide organization with more than 20,000 members.
Its recommendations are based on public meetings in about 100
communities.
   Its report made about 85 specific recommendations, including
changing the General Assembly voting system and enlarging Security
Council membership.
   It said the next U.S. administration should increase U.S.
participation in the United Nations and should not try to reduce its
25 percent share of the budget. It should instead use its financial
leverage to make the United Nations more effective in promoting both
U.S. interests and world peace.
   The report found many U.N. decision-making bodies too unwieldy to
be effective forums for negotiations. It said Washington should
insist on reforms that would enhance the U.N. system as the center
for resolving global problems.
   The study said the United States should make sure that U.N.
budgetary reforms adopted in 1986 are implemented and result in
greater efficiency in use of U.N. resources.
   It said the United States should renew its campaign for
``weighted'' voting on budgetary issues in the General Assembly,
effectively giving the United States and major donors a greater say
in how their funds are spent. But it said ``weight'' also should
consider a nation's population.
   The report said the 15-member Security Council should be
restructured to include a category of semi-permanent members,
representing major powers in each region. This might warrant an
increase of up to four members in council size.
   The council also should meet at least once a year at foreign
minister level and defense ministers also should meet periodically,
it said.
   The council's Military Staff Committee should be revitalized and
oversee limited joint military exercises among the five permament
members _ a sign of their willingness to collaborate in guaranteeing
international peace and security. The five are the United States,
the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. They traditionally play
no part in peacekeeping operations.
   The study proposed that the council look into establishment of a
training program for countries that contribute troops to U.N.
peacekeeping forces. It said U.N. members should establish a reserve
fund under the Security Council to cover initial outlays of new
peacekeeping missions.
   Among other recommendations:
   _Creation of a multilateral drug enforcement assistance unit
within the United Nations.
   _Establishment of a U.N. elections commission to monitor and
conduct free elections at the request of individual nations.
   _An international ban on chemical weapons, with the United States
and Soviet Union assuming the bulk of verification.
   _An international convention on environment and development.
   _An international tribunal to rule on disputed drug trafficking
cases.
   _A ministerial board at the helm of the Economic and Social
Council to oversee U.N. responses to emerging economic,
environmental and social problems.
   And it said the U.N. secretary-general should guard against
demands by member states for political appointments.
   The report is entitled ``Pulling Together: A Program for America
in the United Nations.'' Eleanor Roosevelt founded the New
York-based association 24 years ago to foster better understanding
of the United Nations and the U.S. role in it.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, underdog in his
battle with Republican George Bush for the presidency, had nearly
$20 million as of last week to mount his final push to Election Day,
while Bush had $14.3 million, according to docuents filed Thursday
with the Federal Election Commission.
   The reports of campaign spending and receipts were the
candidates' last mandatory filing before Nov. 8.
   The Dukakis-Bentsen Committee reported that it had spent $26.7
million through Oct. 19, the end of the reporting period, and had
$19.9 million cash remaining. More than a third _ $10.4 million _ of
the campaign's general election expenditures were made during the
19-day period in October.
   Bush, who leads Dukakis in the polls, spent $31.8 million through
Oct. 19, $13.5 million of that during the 19-day period. The
campaign ended the reporting period with $14.3 million cash on hand.
   Both presidential nominees received $46.1 million for the general
election from a federal Treasury fund supported by the voluntary $1
checkoff on individual income tax returns.

<TEXT>
   When colonial patriots tossed 342 chests of tea
into Boston Harbor, they thought they had rid the city of the
symbols of tyranny. But now, an explorer says he has located the
dump site and wants to salvage the chests.
   Barry Clifford, who located the first pirate ship found in the
New World four years ago, appeared Thursday before the state Board
of Underwater Archaeological Resources for permission to survey the
Tea Party site.
   ``Boston Harbor is an archaeological site,'' Clifford said in his
presentation to the board. ``In this day and age, when we have
knowledge of what's at the bottom of the harbor, it's too bad not to
plan so we don't put a tunnel through a 17th century shipwreck.''
   The board, however, tabled his bid for a reconnaissance permit,
which would have awarded Clifford and his team exclusive rights to
survey a nautical square mile in Boston Harbor. Officials asked
Clifford to return for the board's next session Dec. 1 with more
details about the site.
   Acting board director Jim Bradley said the explorer must provide
more specific proof that he has found the location of the Tea Party
chests before the board awards him exclusive rights. Until then,
Bradley said, Clifford and his team are free to electronically scan
the harbor but will not be given an exclusive right to the area.
   Clifford said at the meeting that he did not include specific
data about the site in his permit application because of a security
risk in publicizing the area.
   Clifford, president of Maritime Explorations Inc. in Chatham,
surprised skeptics when he found the treasure-laden Whydah off the
coast of Cape Cod in 1984 and brought up the ship's bell.
   Still, experts have doubts about Clifford's latest venture.
   Paul Johnston, curator of marine history at the Peabody Museum in
Salem and a maritime archaeologist, is dubious about Clifford's
claim that the tea crates were elaborate Chinese chests. Johnston
said the museum has similar ornate Chinese boxes but said that they
were gift boxes. He said he doubts that the British would have
exported tea in fancy containers.
   ``They were probably standard wooden crates,'' said Johnston.
   Johnston also said that he recently learned the site of the tea
dumping was at Griffin's Wharf, which lies considerably inland from
today's Boston Harbor. The wharf is now located beneath a concrete
pad under a Boston Edison substation, he said.
   ``It seems unrealistic to think he could find the tea chests
now,'' said Johnston. ``The whole landscape of the harbor has
changed since then.''
   Clifford and his team have been researching the harbor for 18
months and hope to look for shipwrecks as well as the Tea Party
chests. He wants to examine what he believes is the Tea Party site
with the Maritime Explorer, his 166-foot excavation ship.
   The Boston Tea Party commenced just after dusk on Dec. 16, 1773,
when 30 patriots, angered over King George III's three-penny tax on
a pound of tea, raided three ships, the Eleanor, the Dartmouth and
the Beaver.
   Disguised as Indians, the patriots located the crates in the
ship's hold, brought them on deck, opened them and pitched them
overboard.

<HEAD>Medical Examiner Says Explorer's Son Had Alzheimer's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard E. Byrd Jr., son of the famed arctic
explorer, died of malnutrition and dehydration contributed to by
Alzheimer's disease, the state medical examiner said Thursday.
   Byrd, 68, was found Oct. 3 in a Baltimore warehouse. He had taken
a train from Boston Sept. 13 for Washington to attend ceremonies
honoring his father, Adm. Richard E. Byrd, who flew over the North
Pole in 1926 and later led a series of expeditions to Antarctica.
   Chief Medical Examiner John E. Smialek said an autopsy revealed
that Byrd died of ``malnutrition and dehydration, contributed to by
an underlying degenerative brain disease ... Alzheimer's.''
   Alzheimer's is an organic brain disease that gradually robs its
victims of memory and other intellectual powers. Its cause is
unknown and there is no cure.
   Smialek said he had spoken with Byrd's family, who had not
suspected that he suffered from Alzheimer's.
   ``They were at a loss to explain what happened to him,'' he said.
``When I spoke to them they were considerably relieved to have that
understanding of what had happened.''
   Byrd apparently got off the train in Baltimore and began
wandering, Smialek said. ``In his confused state, he could have
appeared to be intoxicated. ... He wasn't able to seek help.''
   Instead, he gradually became weak from not eating or drinking,
Smialek said.
   When Byrd's family learned that he did not arrive at the National
Geographic Society ceremony, they filed a missing-person report with
Needham, Mass., police Sept. 15.
   A custodian at the warehouse where Byrd's body was found told
police he had ordered Byrd and another man out of the building Sept.
27. Byrd had been dead for several days when his body was found Oct.
3. He wore a green workman's uniform and one shoe.
   His wallet, luggage and other personal property were missing. He
was identified through a Boston Transit Authority card that was
pinned to his undershorts.

<TEXT>
   The death toll from leftist guerrillas
this week rose to 64 and Colombians prepared on Wednesday for more
violence during an impending general strike supported by the rebels.
   Many drivers in Bogota tied small tree branches to their front
bumpers, hoping they would sweep away nails and tacks being spread
in the streets by strike sympathizers.
   Most businesses and all schools routinely close during general
strikes.
   The three largest labor unions called the one-day strike for
Thursday, demanding an increased minimum wage, lower inflation, a
price freeze on basic foods and action against right-wing death
squads.
   President Virgilio Barco ordered Colombia's 300,000 police
officers and soldiers to be on duty Thursday.
   A guerrilla ambush of a civilian bus carrying policemen killed 20
people, Gov. Antonio Roldan Betancur of Antioquia state told a news
conference Wednesday in the state capital Medellin.
   He said rebels knocked the bus off the road with a dynamite
charge Tuesday morning in a remote part of the Andes in northern
Colombia, then it with automatic weapons fire.
   Ten policemen and 10 civilians, including a pregnant woman and a
1-year-old boy, were killed in the ambush and 12 people were
wounded, the governor said. the ambush occurred near Peque village,
200 miles northwest of Bogota.
   On Tuesday and Wednesday, 10 buses were set afire in Medellin,
Tunja, Bucaramanga, Valledupar and Popayan, national police said in
a statement.
   A bomb exploded Wednesday in a Medellin, shopping center but no
one was hurt, police reported.
   Soldiers and police set up checkpoints in major cities, searching
cars for guns and explosives. Army squads with assault rifles and
jeeps mounted with .30 caliber machine guns patrolled streets
Wednesday.
   Two people were found trying to plant a bomb Tuesday in Bogota's
convention center where the minister of mines and energy, Oscar
Mejia Vallejo, was speaking to an oil industry convention, police
said.
   In the northern, banana-growing region of Uraba, guerrillas
raided three plantations, burned eight vehicles and destroyed an
airport and banana processing equipment, national police said in
Antioquia state.
   Guerrillas raided two villages in eastern Colombia on Tuesday and
harangued residents to back the strike, said the army's 5th Brigade
in Bucaramanga.
   Unions organizing the strike want the minimum wage raised from
the current equivalent of about $90 a month for a six-day work week
and the inflation ratelowered from 22 percent. Death squads are
accused of killing about 800 people in the past two years, including
180 union members.

<TEXT>
   Two men and a woman, all from the
Irish Republic, were convicted Thursday of conspiring to kill
Britain's top official for Northern Ireland.
   In Belfast, capital of Northern Ireland, police said a
Soviet-made flamethrower capable of sending a jet of fire 80 yards
was discovered in an IRA arms cache and could have come from Libya.
   After 15 hours of deliberation, a jury at Winchester Crown Court
determined by a 10-2 vote that Martina Shanahan, 22, and John
McCann, 24, of Dublin and Finbarr Cullen, 27, of Maynooth conspired
to murder Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King and other persons
unknown.
   They were to be sentenced Friday by Judge Swinton Thomas.
   Police arrested the defendants Aug. 30, 1987, near King's home in
Wiltshire County, southern England _ Ms. Shanahan and Cullen on
adjoining land and McCann at a campsite 30 miles away.
   Elisa King, the Cabinet member's daughter, had noticed Cullen and
Ms. Shanahan.
   Prosecutor Alan Rawley said the tent at the trio's campsite
contained a list written on cigarette papers of politicians,
soldiers and judges in mainland Britain. They also had 4,500 pounds
(nearly $8,000), binoculars, a radio that could pick up police
frequencies and a woollen hat with eyeholes, he said.
   ``The whole thing stinks to high heaven of a murderous plot to
kill Mr. King if they could, or anybody else on that list if they
could,'' Rawley declared.
   He said they had the addresses and auto license numbers of people
on the list, the names of military establishments and locations of
offices of the governing Conservative Party.
   No evidence was produced in the 14-day trial that the defendants
belonged to the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to
drive the British from Northern Ireland, and no weapons or
explosives were found.
   A report by the British domestic news agency Press Association
said the three had a history of support for Sinn Fein, the IRA's
legal political arm.
   Belfast police said the flamethrower, the first weapon of its
kind found in Northern Ireland, was under the stairs of an
outbuilding on the grounds of a hospice for elderly women in Falls
Road, a Roman Catholic area.
   They said bomb-timers, ammunition and a cement-mixer, which can
be used for mixing explosives, were found with it.
   Staff members at the hospice refused comment on the police search.
   Police spokesmen said they believed the weapon was part of the
huge consignment of Libyan-supplied arms smuggled into Ireland.
   In March, British and Irish officials said the IRA had received
150 tons of weapons from Libya in four shiploads in 1985 and 1986,
including SAM-7 surface-to-air missiles that could be used to shoot
down British army helicopters.

<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   George Bush pocketed a labor endorsement Thursday and said his
drive for the White House was ``all about creating jobs and
opportunity.'' Underdog Michael Dukakis accused his GOP rival of
airing negative campaign commercials to ``divert attention'' from
Reagan-Bush administration failures.
   The pollsters' daily tidings were good once again for Bush, who
was reported leading 51 percent to 42 percent in a nationwide survey
taken for NBC and the Wall Street Journal. New polls also showed a
tight race in New York, one of the country's most Democratic
bastions.
   Dukakis made his way toward Harry Truman's home town of
Independence, Mo., likening himself to the ``feisty little guy'' who
won the White House four decades ago in a storied upset. ``Harry
Truman was a fighter and so am I,'' he said.
   In a 14-minute live interview on the CBS ``Evening News,''
Dukakis said again and again he wants to put the government on the
``side of average Americans.''
   The Democrat also conceded that Bush commercials depicting him as
weak on crime, defense and the environment had done him political
harm. But he said they were also intended to ``to divert public
attention from the fact that this administration has probably had
more corruption and malfeasance than any in recent memory if not in
history.''
   ``This is not about who puts together the best commercials or
best advertising,'' he said. ``It's about which one of us, Mike
Dukakis or George Bush, has the strength and the values to run this
country.''
   Bush continued his week-long emphasis on economic issues as he
made his way down the Pacific Coast from Washington to California.
Along the way he accused Dukakis of trying to ``fan the flames of
protectionism'' in comments on trade and of ``trying to scare the
American people by putting Japanese flags on these American
commercials of his.''
   Bush won the endorsement of the 50,000-member Marine Engineers
Beneficial Association at a rally interrupted by protesters. Four
were hustled away, including one whose nose was bloodied, and Bush
paused in his speech long enough to remind them of the high interest
rates that prevailed at the end of the Carter administration.
   ``This election is all about creating jobs and opportunity,'' he
said, promising to keep the economic expansion alive.
   He briefly added an endorsement from the Columbus, Ohio, NAACP to
his union support, but that was before the group's president
reluctantly reversed course under pressure from national
headquarters. Melanie J. Mitchell said she was acting to avoid
jeopardizing the chapter's tax-exempt status as a non-profit
organization.
   The nine-point lead found for Bush in the NBC-Wall Street Journal
poll was in keeping with what sources said were private soundings
taken for the two candidates. Only 35 percent of those reponding to
the public survey said they were pleased with their choices, and 61
percent said they wished other candidates were running. The survey,
taken from 1,285 likely voters, had a margin of error of three
percentage points.
   Dukakis' campaign announced it would double its budget for
advertisements targeted at Hispanic voters to $1 million, with most
of the money earmarked for seven key states _ Texas, California, New
Mexico, Colorado, Illinois, New York and New Jersey. The
announcement came the same day that radio stations began carrying
paid Democratic commercials in which Jesse Jackson urged a vote for
Dukakis.
   Both candidates filed reports with the federal government showing
huge warchests going into the final few days of the election. Each
candidate received $46.1 million in federal subsidies for the fall
campaign, and as of last week, Bush had $14.3 remaining while
Dukakis had a balance of nearly $19.9 million.
   The campaign surrogates and understudies joined the chorus 12
days before the election.
   President Reagan hailed ``the true grit of George Bush and Dan
Quayle'' as he embarked on a week-long campaign swing aiming to help
make sure the White House stays in Republican hands.
   ``You and I and George Bush worked much too hard to cut your
taxes to let our opponents come into office and raise them all over
again,'' he said in Little Rock, Ark.
   GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was in North Carolina,
where he renewed his pledge to assure college opportunity for all
who want it. But he offered no specifics, saying he had spoken with
Bush ``about education issues in general'' but they ``haven't sat
down and discussed detailed proposals.''
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen told an
audience in Los Angeles that U.S. allies in Europe and Japan should
pay a greater share of defending their own borders. He also said
Dukakis was firmly committed to maintaining America's defense, and
said Republican had ``twisted the truth'' to suggest otherwise.
   Dukakis campaigned in Illinois and Missouri, and he ridiculed the
idea thatBush's proposed capital gains tax cut was a jobs program.
   He said Bush wanted to ``give the people at the top the money and
hope the crumbs fall off the table for the rest of us....
   ``Who's he kidding?'' the Democrat said. ``What are they going to
do with the extra money? Hire a second butler? A lifeguard for the
pool?''
   Bush repeatedly emphasized his opposition to federal gun controls
as he campaigned in the West. His aides distributed copies of a 1976
statement in which Dukakis called for tight handgun restrictions.
   The vice president's morning appearance in Washington state was
interrupted by shouts of ``homes for the homeless'' and ``No more
lies.''
   The vice president shrugged off the disruptions, telling his
cheering supporters that America needs a strong defense and a
vibrant economy, not the policies of the ``governor of
Taxachusetts.''

   Lloyd Bentsen said Thursday he wanted U.S.
allies in Europe and Japan to pick up a bigger share of the free
world's defense costs within the next four years.
   Bentsen, speaking before the World Affairs Council, said that the
United States spends 6.5 percent of its output on the military, that
it can no longer afford to carry the burden for other nations and
that allies strapped after World War II can now afford to do more.
   Afterward, at a news conference, Bentsen said it cost $3.5
billion to protect Japan. ``They could pick up that tab,'' he said,
though he does not support re-arming Japan.
   European allies should also spend more to equalize the burden, he
said, although he added that they were now doing more with their own
troops.
   In his speech, Bentsen said he and Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis were firmly committed to U.S. defense
strength but the Republicans had ``twisted the truth to imply that
Governor Dukakis is an apostle of military weakness.''
   ``That's just not so,'' he said. Both parties plan to spend the
same amount of money on defense, but the Democrats recognize that
there are other threats to national security, he said.
   ``I would suggest that it will profit America little to gain the
whole world of military superiority if we lose the soul of our
economic capacity,'' he said. ``It will profit us little to be
military hawks if the competition is between economic eagles and we
are sitting ducks.''
   Republican policies have turned the United States into an
international debtor, dependent on foreign investors to sustain an
economy saddled with huge trade and budget deficits, he said.
   ``The United States must be able to compete not only militarily
but economically'' if it intends to maintain leadership in the free
world and set an example for developing nations, he told the
council, a private group of business and academic people.
   Taking questions from the group afterward, Bentsen said he
supported some forgiveness of the international debt owed to U.S.
banks by Mexico on a ``case by case basis'' but not as a nation as a
whole. Mexico needs to be treated ``like a company that went
bankrupt'' that pays part but not all on its obligations, he said.
   The council, a Los Angeles based group is scheduled to hear
President Reagan on Friday. Bentsen joked that he was warming them
up for the president.
   But he complained the Republicans ``have found it useful to shape
the discussion as if military strength were the sole touchstone of
national strength. They have twisted the truth to imply that
Governor Dukakis is an apostle of military weakness.''
   ``The American people need to understand that Michael Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen are firmly committed to U.S. military strength,'' he
said. ``Any implication to the contrary is not just negative
campaigning, it is a misrepresentation of fact.''
   Bentsen called for tough enforcement of the new trade bill which
he helped push through the Senate, to open up new markets for U.S.
goods.
   In addition, he said investment in non-military research and
development needed to increase, after being cut 23 percent during
the Reagan years.
   ``While following a passive policy on trade, our government
unfortunately has countenanced retreats on other fronts as well,''
he said. ``Our industrial and academic research base, once the
world's foremost, is losing ground,'' he said.
   In Chico, with a little help from actor Rob Lowe, Bentsen drew
the biggest crowd of his campaign so far at a rally at California
State University.
   A crowd police estimated at 7,000 students and local citizens
heard Bentsen continue his attacks against Republican ``negative
campaigning'' and call for the election to be a ``national referendm
against mudslinging.''
   ``We're going to turn this election around,'' he said, saying the
Democrats were coming back in the polls.
   Lowe told the crowd, including young women who were
enthusiastically screaming at the sight of the celebrity, that the
67-year-old Bentsen was ``a man for the young people.'' The two were
mobbed as they left the outdoor stage, and the Texas senator shook
hands, gave ``high-fives'' and even kissed one woman student as he
worked his way through the crowd.
   Local people said it was the first appearance there by a national
candidate since John Kennedy in 1960.

<HEAD>Anti-Defamation League Says Neo-Nazi Skinhead Groups On Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization that monitors hate groups says
neo-Nazi ``skinhead'' gangs are a growing threat to minorities and
homosexuals, with the number of such gang members nearly doubling in
the United States last year.
   Skinhead gangs, found in 21 states, also are increasingly
establishing ties with such groups as the Ku Klux Klan and the White
Aryan Resistance, the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith
said Wednesday in a national report.
   Skinheads _ youths who shave their heads and preach hatred of
minorities _ have taken part ``in virtually every recent important
hate movement rally, march and conference,'' the report said.
   Skinhead membership nationally has swelled to 2,000, according to
the report, with the majority of members _ as well as the most
violent _ found in California. Skinheads have been blamed for the
racially motivated killing of a San Jose man and attacks on
homosexuals in Laguna Beach.
   The report, ``Hate Crimes: Policies and Procedures for Law
Enforcement Agencies,'' was released in conjunction with a
conference in Los Angeles sponsored by the league.
   The organization, an outgrowth of the Jewish fraternal group
B'nai B'rith, has surveyed anti-Semitic vandalism since 1960 and
broadened its approach in 1979 with publication of an annual audit
of anti-Semitic incidents based on information reported to league
regional offices.
   The report said all kinds of hate crimes should be identified and
tallied nationwide so law enforcement agencies can determine whether
special units and procedures are needed.
   Crimes motivated by hatred or bias because of the victim's race,
religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity or national origin can have
a more devastating effect than other crimes, the report said.
   ``Hate crimes can have a special emotional and psychological
impact ... thereby creating the potential for escalating violence
and turmoil,'' it said.
   The report was written by Midwest Civil Rights Director Michael
Lieberman; Steven M. Freeman, director of the ADL Legal Affairs
Department, and Associate Director Jill L. Kahn.
   Lieberman said in an interview that the most important question
about hate crimes is whether the number is increasing, stable or
decreasing.
   ``We believe that one of the real problems in addressing that is
the lack of hard, comparable and comprehensive data on the issue,''
he said.
   There are only a handful of law enforcement agencies in eight
states that are required to keep statistics on hate crimes, he said,
adding, ``It's anyone's guess as to whether the numbers are going up
or down.''

   Sen. Dan Quayle is promising the chance
for a college education to anyone who wants it under a George Bush
administration, but admitted Thursday he did not know how the
Republican presidential contender plans to make it happen.
   ``I haven't sat down and talked with George Bush on this,'' he
told local reporters in Asheville. ``So I can't go in and tell you
anything.''
   Later Thursday, Quayle campaigned in a high-technology part of
New Jersey, visiting an AT&T long distance headquarters in
Bedminster.
   There he spoke by satellite hookup to employees at 29 AT&T
facilities in the state.
   On the way to the appearance, a campaign staff bus collided with
a school van, and a number of children were taken to a local
hospital for observation. Quayle arranged to visit the children.
   He said the company represents the technological changes of the
future, adding, ``Anyone prepared to lead us into the 1990s and then
into the 21st century must be prepared to harness this change _ to
capture its spirit, its momentum and its excitement so that we turn
challenge into achievement.
   Quayle also told reporters asking him about homelessness he
thinks there is enough low-income housing in the country and the
number of low-income housing units has increased under Reagan. ``But
that doesn't mean that is the only answer or solution,'' Quayle said.
   He said he government should identify other factors contributing
to homelessness, and then work with state and local governments and
the private sector on solutions.
   On the question of higher education, Quayle repeated a comment
that he made a day earlier in Miami: ``We're going to make sure that
a student that wants to go on to higher education will have that
opportunity.''
   But he could give no specifics when reporters asked him what he
dould do toward that goal.
   He said he has spoken to Bush ``about education issues in
general'' but they ``haven't sat down and discussed detailed
proposals.''
   The remarks came on a campaign day in which he kept the
rhetorical heat on Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis,
joked to a Charlotte, N.C., audience that Dukakis was like the
California whales that got trapped beneath an Alaskan ice floe.
   He said one eskimo told another the whales were named Dukakis.
   ```Know what Dukakis means?' the eskimo said. `Hopelessly stuck
in the ice.'''
   Although Quayle generally dealt skillfully with hecklers
throughout the day, some supporters seemed to think he was going a
bit too far in putting down a group of them by referring to the
severely polluted Boston harbor in Dukakis' home state of
Massachusetts. The harbor is a centerpiece of Bush's attack campaign
against Dukakis.
   ``Ever hear of Boston Harbor,'' Quayle asked the campus rally.
   ``Matter of fact, I think Boston Harbor is right over here,'' he
said pointing to the pro-Dukakis signs.
   ``Ouch,'' said one Quayle supporter, as a couple nearby groaned.
   He dealt with a more boisterous crowd in Syracuse, N.Y., where
hecklers forced him to interrupt his speech. The noise level rose
when Quayle supporters in the Civic Center tried to shout down the
pro-Dukakis hecklers.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan returned to his home
state on Thursday and predicted that Vice President George Bush will
``win fair and square'' in the Nov. 8 election.
   ``Now that the game seems to have turned against them, the
liberals have started squealing that he's running a negative
campaign,'' Reagan told a Republican rally at the San Diego Sports
Arena.
   ``Well, I hope the people of Oakland will forgive me, but that
would be a little like the A's complaining that the Dodgers ran a
negative World Series,'' the president said.
   ``They didn't,'' he told his Southern California audience. ``The
Dodgers won fair and square, and come Nov. 8, the Republicans are
going to win fair and square too because they know we stand for the
future and they know the opposition is liberal, liberal, liberal.''
   The crowd, which assistant White House press secretary Ben
Jarratt said was estimated at 11,000, interrupted with frequent
cheers and applause and waved small American flags as the president
spoke. A large banner reading ``We love Nancy'' hung prominently in
the center of the arena although Mrs. Reagan traveled separately to
California and missed the rally.
   The San Diego stop was the president's first in California during
a week-long campaign swing. He and First Lady Nancy reagan will take
a weekend break at their ranch near Santa Barbara before he resumes
campaigning. The White House said Reagan would vote by absentee
ballot during the trip.
   Republicans count on the Californian in the White House as a
major factor in their hopes of garnering the state's 47 electoral
votes.
   Earlier, at Little Rock, Ark., Reagan said Americans should vote
for the GOP ticket ``as an act of self-defense'' because Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis favors gun controls.
   At Springfield, the president who once was a Democrat courted
votes for Sen. John Danforth and other GOP candidates in President
Truman's home state.
   ``Today, Harry Truman's party is the Republican Party, and it's
time to give that party a bigger stick in the Congress and cut the
liberals down to size,'' Reagan said.
   ``We don't want a president who would raise taxes; why elect a
Congress that would?'' he asked. ``We don't want a big-spending
president, why should we want a big-spending Congress? We don't want
a president who would cut our defenses; why vote for a Congress that
wants to do that?''
   The San Diego speech marked the president's second visit to his
home state since the GOP National Convention in New Orleans in
mid-August. During his previous visit in August, Reagan campaigned
in Orange County, a center of GOP conservatism south of Los Angeles.
   ``Nothing is more important in the California race than the
turnout in Orange County and Northern San Diego County and the
Inland Empire,'' said Alan Heslop, a specialist in California voting
patterns.
   ``Those are the great vote-rich areas for Republican candidates
in this state and to wheel Reagan through the Southland is to give
encouragement to the party workers. It is to gear up the turnout and
the get-out-the vote drive,'' he said.
   It is also to raise money.
   Before his current swing, Reagan's 21 political appearances in 13
states since Labor Day had raised an estimated $8.8 million for
national and state GOP campaign treasuries.
   Before he returns to Washington next Wednesday, he will rest at
his Santa Barbara area ranch over the weekend and then speak in
Reno, Nev.; Milwaukee and in another state the White House has not
identified.
   In Arkansas, with its six electoral votes, Reagan told his
airport audience that ``America needs the strength, the vision, and
the true grit of George Bush and Dan Quayle.''
   Reagan, a former movie actor, had previously evoked the memory of
the John Wayne film classic, ``True Grit,'' in extolling his vice
president, but in Little Rock he extended the remark to include the
youthful Indiana senator who is Bush's vice presidential running
mate.
   It was the only reference to Quayle in the speech, which was
devoted largely to praising Bush's record as vice president.
   ``I have come to know George Bush very well,'' Reagan said. ``And
I also know what is required to be president of the United States; I
know who should be the man at the desk, and ladies and gentlemen,
George Bush is the man.''
   ``You and I and George Bush worked much too hard to cut your
taxes to let our opponents come into office and raise them all over
again,'' he said. ``So on Nov. 8, go into that polling booth and do
some negative campaigning of your own, the right kind of negative
campaigning: Say `no' to new taxes and say `yes' to the Republican
ticket.''
   Bush, like Reagan, has vowed to oppose tax increases. Dukakis,
who has not said he will raise taxes, has accused the Bush campaign
of negative campaigning that distorts his record.

   Jessica Hahn's former pastor was indicted
Thursday on charges that he skimmed $90,000 from his congregation
and then tried to persuade Ms. Hahn, the church's secretary, to lie
about it to a grand jury.
   The Rev. Eugene Profeta, 51, used the money to buy life
insurance, buy stocks in his wife's name, pay for family functions
and finance gambling junkets to Atlantic City in a church-owned
plane, according to the charges handed up by an Albany County grand
jury.
   Profeta, to whom Ms. Hahn said she turned for guidance after her
1980 sexual encounter with PTL founder Jim Bakker, was charged with
tax evasion, perjury and tampering with a witness.
   He pleaded innocent and was released on $25,000 bail. He was
ordered to surrender his passport, pilot's license and gun license
and also ordered to stay away from Ms. Hahn.
   Ms. Hahn welcomed the court order of protection, but said she was
still afraid of Profeta, who she alleged had threatened her in the
past.
   ``He has asked me to lie for him. I didn't lie. There's a lot of
reason to believe that he's more than angry,'' Ms. Hahn said in a
telephone interview from the Playboy offices in Los Angeles. ``He
blames me for the entire investigation.''
   ``Yeah, I am afraid,'' she said. ``I feel there are too many of
his people floating around. I've been threatened in the past.''
   Ms. Hahn, who has been living in Phoenix while doing a radio
show, declined to say what she had told the grand jury, other than
to repeat allegations that Profeta had asked her to help him conceal
wrongdoing.
   Ms. Hahn, in text accompanying a nude pictorial in the September
issue of Playboy, said Profeta ``showered her with attention and
convinced her that heavy petting with the pastor was part of her
role as church secretary, babysitter and consort and would leave her
still technically a virgin.''
   The text noted that Profeta ``mesmerized young Jessica with a
combination of fire, brimstone, money and sex.''
   In July 1981 Profeta ``persuaded Jessica to have sexual
intercourse with him for the first time,'' the magazine said.
   ``He said I'm going to prove to you that I'm not like Jim and
John,'' Ms. Hahn said in the article. ``He was going to show me how
women should be treated.''
   The magazine said she later began a ``full-fledged romance'' with
Profeta.
   The charges allege that between 1984 and 1986, Profeta and his
wife, Glenda, used as their personal funds money taken from the Full
Gospel Tabernacle Church in Massapequa, N.Y., a non-denominational
Christian church where Profeta was the pastor. The indictment also
alleged that the Profetas failed to declare the income on their New
York state tax returns.
   The indictment charged that Profeta tried to persuade Ms. Hahn to
lie to the grand jury about gifts she received from him, including
fur coats, casino trips, hotel stays, jewelry, apartment rent and
automobile payments.
   The grand jury had been investigating Profeta since the summer of
1987, shortly after the Bakker-Hahn scandal broke.
   A year ago, Ms. Hahn appeared before the grand jury and told
reporters afterward that Profeta's church group was ``a world just
as disturbed'' as that of Bakker and his PTL television ministry.
   Since the publicity about her involvement with Bakker, Ms. Hahn
has been featured in Playboy interviews and nude pictorials and has
stayed at the Playboy mansion in California.
   Albany County Judge Joseph Harris issued the protection order for
Ms. Hahn at the request of Assistant Attorney General Peter Crusco,
despite contentions by Profeta's lawyer that it would add to a
``media circus'' surrounding the case and deprive Profeta of a fair
trial.
   The attorney, John Gross, said the order implied that the
tampering allegations against the minister were true. Harris
responded there was no such implication and Profeta would receive a
fair trial.
   ``These charges represent a scheme to cheat the state and all
law-abiding taxpayers,'' said Attorney General Robert Abrams. ``But
more importantly, Rev. Profeta allegedly abused the not-for-profit
status of a religious organization for his own personal gain.''
   Gross refused to discuss the case with reporters.
   In setting the $25,000 bail, Harris said he wanted assurances
from Gross that the money wasn't from church funds. Crusco had asked
for $100,000 bail, while Gross had argued that no bail was needed
because of Profeta's position in the community.
   ``This man has been a minister for over 30 years,'' Gross said.
``He's got a congregation of over 1,000. There is no proof to these
charges.''
   Profeta was charged with three counts of offering a false
instrument for filing, two counts of tax evasion, six counts of
falsifying business records, one count of attempted perjury, three
counts of witness tampering and three counts of criminal
solicitation.
   Mrs. Profeta, 44, was indicted on three counts of offering a
false instrument for filing and two counts of tax evasion. Her case
was postponed until next month because she is recuperating at home
from an infection she contracted after surgery, Gross said.
   The Profetas each face a maximum of four years in prison if
convicted of tax evasion and offering a false instrument for filing,
the most serious charges.

   A prison supply supervisor who fled war-torn
Cambodia for a new life was bludgeoned to death Thursday at the
maximum-security institution.
   Stateville Correctional Center ``is under lockdown. It will stay
on indefinitely ... until we get to the bottom of this,'' said
Corrections Department spokesman Nic Howell.
   He said one prisoner was caught near the scene of the killing,
and was being held in separate custody. No charges were filed
immediately.
   The victim, Suon Troeung, 53, of Romeoville was struck on the
head and was dead on arrival at Silver Cross Hospital, Howell said,
adding he did not know how many times Troeung was struck.
   Will County State's Attorney Edward Masters, whose office will
handle the case, said prosecutors were awaiting a report from prison
officials before deciding whether to file charges against the
suspect.
   ``We did recover some physical evidence that links the inmate to
the attack,'' said Howell. ``We also recovered a piece of pipe we
believe may have been used in the attack.''
   The suspect was serving a 60-year term for the murder of an
off-duty police officer, Howell said.
   Troeung's body was found early in the day at the prison store he
operated where inmates buy cigarettes, shampoo and other items,
Howell said in a telephone interview from Springfield.
   Troeung, called ``Sonny'' by co-workers, left Southeast Asia in
1975. He had been a captain in the Cambodian army, where he served
as a supply officer.
   Troeung began working at Stateville as a correctional officer in
1978 and was promoted to supply supervisor a year later. He was put
in charge of the prison commissary in 1985, Howell said.

   The former deacon of a faith-healing sect
was convicted Thursday of manslaughter in his son's death from
untreated juvenile diabetes.
   Bobby Dan Norman, 43, quietly hugged his wife, Judith, following
the verdict by a Spokane County Superior Court jury that deliberated
about 10 hours after nearly three weeks of testimony.
   The Normans were members of a nameless, Christian faith healing
sect that eschewed conventional medicine and practiced strict
discipline of children and adults.
   Witnesses testified that the Normans' 10-year-old son, Aaron, was
spanked and harshly interrogated by his father and sect founder Doug
Kleber the day before he died at the family's home near Spokane on
Dec. 20, 1987.
   The beatings were an effort to get the boy to confess sins, which
the men believed were making him ill, witnesses testified.
   A doctor testified that the beatings could have worsened the
boy's illness. Norman admitted under questioning by Colwell that he
was responsible for his son's death.
   Deputy Spokane County Prosecutor Clark Colwell declined to say
whether he will ask for a sentence outside the standard 31- to
41-month range for first-degree manslaughter.
   Norman's lawyer, Roger Peven, said it's too early to consider an
appeal, noting that the Normans originally were both charged with
first-degree murder, but only Bobby Norman was tried for
manslaughter.
   In closing arguments, Colwell depicted Norman as a ``fanatic''
who recklessly failed to seek medical attention for his son.
   Peven argued that Norman was a man whose life was controlled by
sect leaders and said religious fervor blinded his client to the
boy's illness.
   Sect leaders were seen as prophets, and were consulted on matters
ranging from car purchases to sexual relations, testimony indicated.
   Kleber and former Spokane pastor Jeffrey Siegel, both 34 and from
Champaign-Urbana, Ill., pleaded guilty earlier to second-degree
criminal mistreatment. Three former elders face trial on similar
charges next year.
   Before the sect disbanded in February, it claimed about 300 adult
members in Washington, Illinois, Texas and New Jersey.

   A letter found in a Lebanese woman's luggage
and bearing the name of U.S. hostage Alann Steen appears to be a
fake, police said Thursday.
   The letter and photographs of two U.S. hostages _ Steen and Terry
Anderson _were found Oct. 20 in a false bottom of luggage belonging
to the woman after she arrived at Milan's Linate airport from
Beirut. She was identified as Aline Ibrahim Rizkallah, 36.
   ``We have examined the document (Steen's letter), and for the
moment we can only say that it appears evidently false,'' said
Achille Serra, head of the police anti-terrorism unit in Milan.
   He said U.S. and Italian experts compared the signature to
samples of Steen's handwriting. ``If you just take a look, you see
that this one is fake,'' he said.
   Police said earlier the photographs were reproductions of ones
issued by kidnapers months ago. A third photograph has not yet been
identified.
   Police said the woman was to deliver the letter, photographs and
other documents to Aldo Anghessa, an Italian arms trader with links
to the Italian and Swiss secret services, and he was supposed to
give the pictures and letter to a third party.
   Prosecutor Ferdinando Pomarici, the investigation chief, said
Thursday that Anghessa ``said he was working to free the hostages,''
but Pomarici expressed doubts Anghessa had been truthful. He would
not elaborate.
   The U.S. government has denied any involvement in the case.
   The Lebanese woman was arrested after she was found to be
carrying $1,000 in counterfeit U.S. bills and 50 grams (1.7 ounces)
of heroin.
   She said she received the pictures, documents and drugs in
Lebanon from a man called ``Shant'' who was in contact with
Hezbollah, the organization linked to pro-Iranian extremist groups
holding the hostages, Pomarici said.
   One faction with ties to Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, reiterated
Thursday it was not connected with the woman and did not provide
Anderson's photo.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized on March 16, 1985 and is believed held by Islamic
Jihad.
   Steen, an educator from Boston, was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 at
Beirut University College. Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibility.
   Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian are
missing and believed held hostage in Lebanon.

   A car bomb, a firebomb attack on a police
post and a confrontation between police and youths throwing stones
injured at least 40 people in Srinigar on Thursday, including 22
police, authorities said.
   Three people were in serious condition, police said.
   The bombings were the latest in a series of explosions that
jolted the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state this week, but no
one was hurt until Thursday, said G.J. Pandit, director-general of
police.
   The violence coincided with a strike call by three Moslem
fundamentalist groups _ the Islamic Students League, the People's
League and the Moslem Students Federation _ on the 40th anniversary
of Jammu-Kashmir's entry into the Indian union.
   No one has claimed responsibility for any of the blasts. But
authorities have blamed pro-Pakistan militants, who oppose Kashmir's
becoming Indian.
   Kashmir has been an issue in three wars fought between India and
Pakistan and remains an issue.

   Thursday was Terry Anderson's 41st
birthday, his fourth in captivity, and his captors released an old
photograph of the American journalist to support a statement denying
links to a woman arrested in Italy.
   A statement delivered with it to a Western news agency said a
photo of Anderson found in the possession of Aline Ibrahim
Rizkallah, arrested in Milan last week, was a reverse print of one
originally released Aug. 2, 1987.
   Islamic Jihad, which means Islamic Holy War, claims
responsibility for kidnapping Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press.
   The Beirut staff observed the birthday in his office, which they
call ``Terry's room.'' No changes have been made in it since his
abduction in west Beirut on March 16, 1985, other than displaying
the 13 photographs of him released by the kidnappers.
   Staff members sang ``Happy Birthday, Dear Terry'' and blew out
the candles on a chocolate cake.
   Lebanon's state-run television station screened a one-minute film
Thursday evening showing Anderson's 3-year-old daughter, Sulome, who
was born after he was kidnapped. His other daughter, Gabrielle, was
10 at the time.
   With her hands clasped, Sulome sang, ``Happy birthday to you,
dear Daddy'' and said, ``God, let Dad come to us soon.''
   The videotape then showed Sulome playing with her toys while her
mother's voice rose from the background and said: ``Happy birthday,
dear Terry. We want you to know you're always in our hearts. Here's
our daughter sending her love and hoping to see you soon. Be patient
darling please. God bless you.''
   There was no way to tell whether Anderson saw the film, although
various radio stations and newspapers in Beirut carried advance
advertisements about it for two days.
   In Cadiz, Ky., Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, expressed hope for
his release on or before U.S. Election Day, Nov. 8.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said those holding hostages in Lebanon are perpetrating ``a crime
against humanity,'' according to friends and relatives of the
prisoners who met with the U.N. chief.
   Anderson has been held longest of 14 foreigners still missing in
Lebanon. Most or all the captives, who include nine Americans, are
believed to be in the hands of radical Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran.
   Italian police have said the photographs found in the woman's
luggage were reproductions. They were of Anderson, American hostage
Alann Steen and a man who was not identified.
   In Thursday's 22-line statement, typewritten in Arabic, Islamic
Jihad said: ``A negative of the picture was taken. A photograph was
printed in a reverse manner.''
   Accompanying the statement were a copy of the Anderson photograph
and a reverse reproduction of it. The reverse print appeared
identical to the one found in Ms. Rizkallah's possession.
   Also in the envelope were photocopies of the original picture as
printed in the leftist Beirut daily As-Safir the day after its first
release last year, and of the reproduction carried by Ms. Rizkallah,
as published by Beirut newspapers.
   In the original, Anderson was looking directly into the camera
with his head inclined slightly to the right. In the reproduction,
his head tilts to the left.
   The Islamic Jihad statement said: ``The Italian government is
held responsible for publishing all the details about this case. It
is also accused of complicity with the so-called Aline Rizkallah in
coordination with the Israeli and American intelligence services
until proven otherwise.
   ``We renew our threat to all local and foreign (news) agencies
against manipulating and trading in the photographs and documents
which we attach to our statements and which we hope they will be
published in full in line with journalistic honesty.''
   The statement made no reference to Anderson's birthday.
   Islamic Jihad said in a statement released Monday that Ms.
Rizkallah was not involved ``in any matter related to us
whatsoever.'' The group also holds American educator Thomas
Sutherland, who was abducted June 10, 1985.
   The spiritual head of Lebanon's Sunni Moslem community, Grand
Mufti Sheik Hassan Khaled, expressed ``regret over Mr. Anderson's
continued captivity for such a long period.''
   In a statement given to the AP on Thursday, he said: ``We plead
with all those who have self respect, cherish humanitarian values
and respect freedom to work for the return of all the hostages to
their families.''
   Lebanon's Sunni community has not been involved in taking
hostages.

   President Reagan recommended Thursday that the
new U.S. Embassy in Moscow be razed and rebuilt from the ground up
because it is riddled with listening devices that cannot be removed.
   Reagan told reporters the United States has ``no choice'' in the
matter ``because there's no way to rid it of the many listening
devices that were built into it.''
   ``We're going to start and have an American-built one,'' Reagan
said of the embassy.
   Meanwhile, a State Department source disclosed late Thursday that
the United States has filed claims against the Soviet Union for $29
million in connection with ``defects and delays'' in the
construction of the embassy.
   In April 1987, administration officials said the United States
had filed such a claim, but the preliminary total at that time was
only about $10 million. The claims are to be negotiated by an
arbitration panel in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that the
$29 million does not include possible reparations by the Soviets for
the installation of eavesdropping devices in the building or the
eventual costs to replace the building.
   ``We're talking to the Soviets now'' in an attempt to settle how
much such reparations might be, the source said, explaining that
before that issue can go before the arbitration panel, ``We have to
show good faith that the Soviets and we have tried to work this
out.''
   National security adviser Colin Powell, during an appearance at
the National Press Club, said ``it will be a very expensive
proposition, a very, very difficult task to put up a building in
Moscow.''
   Powell said U.S. officials would have to discuss the situation
with Soviet officials and said he was hopeful something could be
worked out ``in light of the improving relations with the Soviet
Union.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said Reagan
will urge Congress to permit the virtually completed embassy to be
demolished and reconstructed with American-made components to be
shipped from the United States and stored in Moscow warehouses under
the tightest possible security. He said the building will be
assembled by U.S. workers taken to Moscow for that purpose.
   The Soviets will not be permitted to move into their newly built
embassy in Washington until the United States can occupy its
facilities in Moscow, Redman said.
   He said that tearing down the existing structure and building a
new one under high security conditions will involve ``a very
elaborate and costly process.''
   ``Obviously we're talking years,'' Redman said.
   But he said the final cost cannot now be estimated because
entirely new engineering and architectural plans will have to be
drawn up.
   He said Reagan's proposed demolition and reconstruction plan was
recommended by Secretary of State George P. Shultz following several
reviews of the project by U.S. experts.
   ``This option offers the best overall solution to the problem,''
Redman said.
   He said the rebuilt eight-story embassy will occupy the same sit
but will be different than the one recommended for demolition. The
new structure will incorporate features ``to take into account what
we have learned'' about Soviet eavesdropping capabilities, he said.
   ``Every precaution will be taken to assure the security of the
process,'' Redman said.
   But he repeatedly declined to say exactly what devices the United
States had discovered in the new structure or how they had been
installed because ``it's never in anyone's interest to let the other
guy know what you know.''
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency TASS said the spying
allegations were ``groundless, obviously farfetched,'' and ``Just as
in previous cases ... the U.S. administration did not provide any
material proof.''
   Redman said that although the cost will be high, it will be worth
it to assure a secure and safe working place for U.S. diplomats in
Moscow, one that will be expected to serve for at least the next
half century.
   Meanwhile, he said the United States will continue to renovate
the turn-of-the century embassy building it has used since the
1930's to make it safer and more secure until a new building can be
occupied.
   The first eavesdropping bugs, in structural elements built by
Soviet workers and transported to the site, were discovered by U.S.
inspectors in the spring of 1987. The United States and the Soviet
Union agreed in 1972 to build new, larger embassies in each other's
capital.
   One member of Congress who toured the facility, Rep. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, said in September that $38 million remained in
previously approved embassy-construction appropriations to dismantle
the unoccupied embassy.
   But Rep. Snowe said that BDM Corp., which inspected the facility
for the State Department, said the dismantling it could cost $160
million. Construction of the bug-riddled embassy and studies about
its future have cost nearly $60 million to date.

   Something strange is going on in this year's 33
election contests for the U.S. Senate: Democrats are raising more
campaign money than their Republican rivals.
   By the end of last month, according to financial data reported to
the Federal Election Commission, the 33 Democrats running for Senate
seats had collected $83.6 million toward their campaigns. Their 33
GOP opponents had pulled in $73.3 million.
   ``It is unusual,'' said Tom Mason, communications director for
the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party's campaign
arm. ``But it's incumbency talking,'' as well as givers'
expectations that the Senate will remain under Democratic control,
he said.
   It is true that incumbents always have an easier time raising
campaign money, and that Democrats have more incumbents, 15, up for
re-election this year than the Republicans, 12.

   The State Department's second-ranking official
says Eastern Europe is in the throes of ``dramatic change,'' with a
strong desire for closer ties to the West and withdrawal of Soviet
troops from the region.
   The East European countries ``are beginning to return to their
historical position where they were independent countries, part of
Europe, associated with the West economically, politically,'' John
Whitehead said in an interview Wednesday. ``I believe they are
beginning to return to historically their more normal position.''
   Whitehead, who returned recently from an 11-day visit to the six
Soviet allies in the region, said the pace of change is uneven, with
Poland and Hungary at the forefront, Romania lagging behind and
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and East Germany ``somewhere in between.''
   ``The impression of my trip is that there is dramatic change
going on in Eastern Europe, not everywhere,'' he said. ``This is a
very favorable change from the point of view of the United States.''

   Larry Flynt offered a self-styled soldier of
fortune $1 million to kill rival sex magazine publishers Hugh Hefner
and Bob Guccione, and Frank Sinatra and Walter Annenberg,
authorities said.
   The purported hitman, Mitchell WerBell, died of a heart attack in
December 1983 about a month after Flynt gave him the check,
sheriff's Capt. Robert Grimm said Wednesday night. WerBell was in
his 60s when he died of natural causes, authorities said.
   Flynt's alleged motive was not disclosed and no charges have been
filed against him.
   Grimm told a news conference that information about the plot
turned up recently in an investigation of the 1983 murder-for-hire
slaying of New York theater producer Roy Radin, whom authorities
said was embroiled in a soured finance deal for the movie ``The

   A judge's decision has forced Rep. Pat Swindall to
fight an uphill battle for re-election while under a perjury
indictment. But he has said he hasn't lost any moral high ground to
his opponent, former actor Ben Jones.
   In one of the nation's bitterest campaigns, Swindall, R-Ga., has
repeatedly brought up his Democratic rival's admitted alcoholism and
past brushes with the law. Jones, who played ``Cooter'' on
television's ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' has proposed in turn that
Swindall be tested for drug use and psychiatric problems.
   The battle returned to the limelight Wednesday when U.S. District
Judge Robert Vining halted the two-term congressman's trial on 10
perjury counts until after the Nov. 8 election.
   Swindall's high-speed strategy of representing himself as his own
attorney amid the campaign backfired when Vining brought into court
two recent campaign mailings, one of which mentioned Swindall's
claim that a private polygraph test supports his defense.

   In the closing days of the
presidential race, George Bush keeps telling audiences ``I'm running
like I'm 10 points behind.'' Actually, he's running the
play-it-safe, no-surprises campaign of a front-runner.
   Major polls indicate Bush is well ahead of Democratic rival
Michael Dukakis. And Bush is not tampering with what has proven to
be a successful formula of bashing Dukakis as a diehard liberal who
is weak on crime, soft on defense and apt to raise taxes.
   ``This election is far from over,'' Bush told an audience of
several hundred people at a stockyard rally in Sioux Falls, S.D.
``You've seen those national surveys but let me tell you something.
I am going to continue to run like I am 10 points behind, right down
to the wire, standing on the issues.
   Bush added, ``I am determined to win this election. I am not
going to let up. I am not going to refuse to campaign. I'll keep
going as far and as fast as is required.''

   The 58 House members facing no major party
challenge to re-election have raised $14.4 million for their
campaigns, and nearly half of them will be entitled to keep any
unspent money when they retire, a private study said Friday.
   The list includes such House leadership figures as Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, and Reps. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., chairman of the
Rules Committee; John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and
Commerce Committee, and Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the
Agriculture Committee.
   Forty-one of the 58 unopposed lawmakers are Democrats, who
control the House, according to the study compiled by the watchdog
group Congress Watch. The $14.4 million includes $7.3 million from
political action committees.

   The ballot is so bewildering in
California this year that some officials have borrowed an idea from
the supermarket for the Nov. 8 election _ express lanes for those
who know how they are going to vote.
   Even by California standards this year's ballot is crowded,
complex and confusing.
   There are 29 statewide propositions, and some communities have
added dozens of measures and campaigns. And of course, voters also
must contend with the presidential election, a senatorial contest
and congressional races.

   Americans' personal incomes rose a moderate 0.5
percent in September while consumer spending turned in its weakest
performance in almost a year, the government said Thursday in
reports that offered fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing.
   The Commerce Department said personal consumption spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, was unchanged
in September following a 0.6 percent August rise.
   It was the first time spending had failed to advance since a 0.2
percent drop in October 1987. That decline had been blamed in part
on consumer anxiety from the record stock market plunge.

   All major factions, ranging
from black activists to hardline white segregationists, claimed
success Thursday after the country's largest and most divisive
municipal elections.
   President P.W. Botha's National Party, although beaten by the
far-right Conservative Party in dozens of white towns, triumphed in
several major battlegrounds and claimed that a 33 percent turnout in
contested black wards was a rebuff to activists who had urged a
boycott.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of the leading boycott
proponents, said the government's claims were ``quite hilarious''
and noted that only a small fraction of blacks were eligible to
vote. He and other anti-apartheid leaders urged the government to
ignore white extremists and negotiate to give blacks full voting
rights in national affairs.

   Soviet officials once criticized the U.S. space
shuttle as wasteful and unreliable, but they are about to launch
their own reusable orbiter that looks a lot like the American craft.
   Despite the similarity in appearance and design, however, the
Soviets seem to have settled on different uses for their shuttle,
named the Buran, which is Russian for snowstorm.
   For years, the Soviets wouldn't even admit they were developing
their own shuttle, or ``chelnok,'' even though Western specialists
date the program back to at least 1982.
   The Buran will be launched on an unmanned mission at 6:23 a.m.
Moscow time Saturday (11:23 p.m. EDT Friday) from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome on the Central Asian steppes of the republic of
Kazakhstan.

   Demands for improved safety procedures at U.S.
nuclear weapons-making plants mounted Thursday as 31 members of the
House Armed Services Committee appealed directly to President Reagan.
   ``This crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period, and
it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance, safety and
operating conditions,'' the lawmakers said in a companion letter to
Energy Secretary John S. Herrington.
   The letters, drafted by Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., and signed by
committee chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., urged Reagan to appoint
quickly the five-member Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which
Congress ordered created this fall to oversee the troubled weapons
complex.
   The lawmakers expressed particular concern over the Savannah
River Plant at Aiken, S.C., where the Energy Department's last three
operational weapons production reactors have been shut down for
safety reasons.

   The Defense Department is overpaying its
contractors millions of dollars a year _ perhaps up to $1 billion _
simply because its procurement agents aren't monitoring quarterly
financial statements, an internal audit has found.
   While those overpayments are for the most part eventually
recovered, the government is, at the very least, losing interest
payments on the money from contractors and placing an additional
financial burden on itself through premature payouts, the Pentagon
auditors concluded.
   And to make matters worse, the shortcomings were clearly
identified five years ago in an audit that elicited promises of
improvement from the armed services, said a report by the Defense
Department inspector general's office.

   Palestinians buried the 19 people killed in
Israel's most destructive air raid of the year and subsequent ground
fighting, then fled Thursday as Israeli warplanes streaked low
overhead but did not attack.
   The dead were taken by small funeral processions to the main
cemetery of this ancient southern port and a Palestinian graveyard
in the nearby village of Darb el-Seem after Moslem noon prayers.
   Sirens wailed as mourners started home to the Mieh Mieh refugee
camp, target of the air raid. Guerrillas and civilians scattered,
ducking for cover as two jets flashed past.

   Thursday was Terry Anderson's 41st
birthday, his fourth in captivity, and his captors released an old
photograph of the American journalist to support a statement denying
links to a woman arrested in Italy.
   A statement delivered with it to a Western news agency said a
photo of Anderson found in the possession of Aline Ibrahim
Rizkallah, arrested in Milan last week, was a reverse print of one
originally released Aug. 2, 1987.
   Islamic Jihad, which means Islamic Holy War, claims
responsibility for kidnapping Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press.
   The Beirut staff observed the birthday in his office, which they
call ``Terry's room.'' No changes have been made in it since his
abduction in west Beirut on March 16, 1985, other than displaying
the 13 photographs of him released by the kidnappers.

   The Educational Testing Service unveiled plans
Thursday for a comprehensive new teacher licensing exam, including
computer simulations of classroom situations, to help states weed
out incompetents.
   ``There is a widespread and growing concern about the
preparedness and effectiveness of beginning teachers, and we believe
that breakthroughs in research and technology make possible a new
kind of assessment that will provide greater assistance, fairness
and accuracy,'' said ETS President Gregory R. Anrig.
   He expressed hope that the new exam would help put to rest
recurring charges by teacher unions and others that existing teacher
tests don't accurately assess classroom skills and are unfair to
minorities.

   President Reagan recommended Thursday that the
new U.S. Embassy in Moscow be razed and rebuilt from the ground up
because it is riddled with listening devices that cannot be removed.
   Reagan told reporters the United States has ``no choice'' in the
matter ``because there's no way to rid it of the many listening
devices that were built into it.''
   ``We're going to start and have an American-built one,'' Reagan
said of the embassy.
   National security adviser Colin Powell, during an appearance at
the National Press Club, said ``it will be a very expensive
proposition, a very, very difficult task to put up a building in
Moscow.''

   The government presented its first budget designed
to help the long-suffering Soviet consumer, and declared Thursday
that state-run farms and companies will be shut down if they do not
make profits.
   Inefficient central planning also is to be curtailed, in keeping
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of radical economic
reform.
   Officials painted a gloomy picture of Soviet life in a burst of
honesty unique to the annual two-day budget sessions of the Supreme
Soviet.
   The national legislature's 1,500 deputies usually hear hours of
dull speeches on the success of the current Five-Year Plan, but this
time they were told of cramped housing, food rotting en route to
stores, jammed trains during vacation periods and new equipment
unused on factory floors.

   Republicans and Democrats cried foul Thursday
after President Reagan, despite a written pledge of support from his
budget office, said he would veto a bill that would protect federal
employees who blow the whistle on government wrongdoing.
   ``It's outrageous conduct and has created a bipartisan explosion,
because it violates the basic understanding we need but now no
longer have ... that an administration's word is good,'' said the
chief Senate sponsor of the bill, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
   The president said he would ``pocket veto'' the bill _ let it die
by refusing to sign it while Congress is out of session.
   While the budget office pledged support for the bill, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, whose objections led to the veto decision,
said the Justice Department had expressed its concerns about the
legislation to Congress ``as recently as a week or two ago.''

   One day of training at a police academy
caused a cadet's arms to swell ``like Popeye's,'' his mother said
Thursday before a hearing reviewing police training after 16
recruits were hospitalized last month.
   Nearly a third of the 50 cadets at the academy in Agawam became
ill after the training. One cadet required a liver transplant and
was in a coma for two weeks; the rest suffered from dehydration and
exhaustion.
   Thursday's testimony was heard by a panel of 21 law enforcement
and medical experts appointed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to review
state training methods after the tales of strenuous training and
verbal abuse at Agawam surfaced.
   The state-run academy trains officers for local police
departments in Massachusetts.

   Bobbing in the big, old-fashioned
tub, toes hooked over a water spout to keep from capsizing as tiny
bubbles effervesce up the length of a sore spine, it's hard to worry
whether this is just what the doctor ordered.
   ``If you don't have anything wrong with you, if you lead a
strenuous life, it's just for relaxation,'' says bathhouse attendant
Gertrude Zorn.
   Otherwise, says Zorn, who for 15 years has been drawing the water
for the tub then coming back to wrap the client in a hot sheet when
it's time to get out, the bubbly float on naturally carbonated water
is good for arthritis, rheumatism and bad backs.
   The bathhouses with their white tile walls, ceiling-fans and
small individual suites with the giant tubs, look as though they
haven't changed from the 1930s when the state decided the area's
carbonated waters were a natural resource.
   Nothing trendy here, especially the price: $8.75 for the soak,
room and attention.
   But elsewhere, spas are an old-fashioned idea gone Yuppie _ and a
multimillion-dollar business. For many now, spa means the chrome and
glass spot where you ride exercise machines in a fuchsia leotard. It
can mean being floated in a seawater tub or swathed in an herbal
wrap.
   Jeffrey Joseph, a New York entrepreneur who jumped in just as the
water was heating up, says his travel agency has tripled in both
staff and bookings since he began specializing in spa vacations a
year and a half ago.
   Joseph, owner of Spa-Finders Travel Arrangements Ltd., estimates
that in five years, the number of spas in this country has increased
from 30 to 150 and is still growing.
   About 1.2 million Americans spend $700 million to $800 million
annually going to spas, Joseph estimates. The majority of his
clients, who spend about $1,000 for a week's retreat, are low-level
female executives in their 30s.
   But is the new emphasis on physical conditioning simply a fad, or
is it really good for your health?
   Are you ready for this? A $1,000-$3,500 week at a spa can be as
healthful as sitting at home in your rocker or taking a hot shower,
say both a cardiologist and a sports psychologist.
   ``Does it feel good to go sit in a whirlpool or a hot mineral
bath? Of course, it feels good,'' says psychologist Eric Margenau of
New York City.
   ``Does it serve a medicinal purpose? I haven't seen any evidence
of that.''
   What about stress management? That's the new ``buzz word,'' says
Joseph.
   The experts say any form of relaxation and exercise will do if
you plan for it and do it regularly. If you go off once a year,
expecting an expensive vacation to be your lifeline for the next 12
months, you're in trouble.
   ``I like spas, they're great. But I've been to great dude ranches
that I've come back from just as refreshed,'' says Margenau, the
author of a new book called ``Sports Without Pressure.''
   Dr. James M. Rippe, the cardiologist who heads the Exercise
Physiology Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical
School in Worcester, echoes that. He says people mustn't delude
themselves that ``they can go twice a year and make up for the
excesses of the rest of the year.''
   Joseph, whose agency has sent nearly 4,000 clients to spas around
the world since March 1987, says the better resorts work on behavior
modification. In other words, they don't just put you in an aerobics
class or stick you on a diet, ``they have a whole program on stress
management and healthy living _ things to take home with you.''
   Spas as places to take mineral waters go back at least as far as
the Romans.
   In Europe and Japan, people have been spa-minded for centuries.
One town in Japan _ Beppu, known for boiling ponds that shoot mud
into the air _ gets 12 million visitors each year, Joseph said.
   In this country, traditional spas with a chic clientele were
booming before the turn of the century _ places like Mineral Wells,
Texas; Hot Springs, Ark.; White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.; and
Calistoga, Calif., which stands for California's Saratoga.
   This New York town, the granddaddy of American spas whose
medicinal springs were discovered in the late 18th century, was long
a social hot spot with its added cache of a thoroughbred racing
season.
   Nowadays, Morgenau sees the proliferation of spas as part of a
burgeoning ``stress industry.''
   ``The whole business is blown up way out of proportion. There is
a whole economy built up around stress reduction, the new American
fads _ spas, contraptions, a $1,000 worth of vitamins.''
   Instead of those remedies, he recommends altering day-to-day
patterns to defuse pressure. Slow down, he says, take a longer
lunch, schedule exercise.
   ``Yes, stress exists. It always has. But most of the stresses are
very easily remedied.''
   ``Every man's spa is his shower,'' says Rippe, the author of many
medical and fitness books.
   The medical school professor cites his own studies and those of
colleagues that indicate showers and sitting in a recliner can
reduce tension and anxiety, and that blood pressure, as well, is
reduced by regular programs of walking.
   Barbara Sloan, a confirmed spa-goer, isn't interested in hearing
she could have stayed home and taken a shower.
   ``It was wonderful,'' she said of a posh Florida spa. ``A massage
was part of every day. The food, absolutely out of this world.''
   Joseph's catalog says a week at the resort Mrs. Sloan visited
also included greens fees, herbal wrap, salt-glo loofa scrub,
hairdo, makeup, manicure, pedicure and lectures _ all for $1,970.
   ``A spa,'' said Mrs. Sloan, president of a New Jersey public
relations firm, ``means attention and luxury.
   ``Plush towels, beautiful locker rooms, pampering. If you have to
wait for an massage appointment, they give you a cup of bouillon,''
she said.
   ``I can't imagine it was not good for you.''

<HEAD>Anti-Personnel Mines Delay Refugees' Return to Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-personnel mines designed to maim
an enemy remain scattered about Afghanistan and must be cleared
before more than 5 million refugees in Pakistan and Iran can return
home, United Nations officials say.
   The mines are estimated to range in number from hundreds of
thousands to 5 million. Some look like toys and are small enough to
fit in the palm of a person's hand. If picked up, they can blow away
a hand; if stepped on, a victim can lose a foot.
   Zia Rizvi, spokesman for the U.N. Economic and Humanitarian
Program for Afghan refugees, said the landmines have to be found and
defused before a billion-dollar rebuilding program can begin.
   The devices are believed to have been laid by Soviet and Afghan
government forces during their nine-year war against Moslem
insurgents. The insurgents also have laid a number of anti-tank
devices.
   Teams of mine-clearing experts from the United States, Britain,
France and Turkey have been in Pakistan to plan a training program
designed to show Afghans how to locate, identify and defuse the
mines.
   A $9-million training program is scheduled to begin shortly,
Rizvi said.
   Clearing the mines ``is a pre-requisite to any (rebuilding)
activity,'' said Rizvi.
   The Soviets are not a contributor to the mine-clearing effort,
but they ``have assured us of their total cooperation,'' said Rizvi.
   Since the April signing of an accord providing for the withdrawal
of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the United
Nations has begun mobilizing for one of the largest refugee
movements in its history.
   Rizvi said the widespread use of the landmines ``is a comment on
the people who make, sell, buy and use them.''
   The U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas, known as the Mujahedeen, have
been fighting the Afghanistan's Marxist government since it seized
power in 1978. The Soviet Union entered the conflict in December
1979.
   Fifteen different types of anti-personnel mines have been
identified along with five models of anti-tank mines, Rizvi said.
   In addition to the anti-personnel devices that resemble toys are
are scattered around villages, another common type is a bright green
plastic device that looks like a butterfly and fits into the palm of
a hand.
   Rizvi said unexploded ordnance of other kinds, such as dud bombs,
also are scattered around the Afghan countryside.
   The first task of foreign mine-detecting experts will be to make
Afghans aware of what to look for. Rizvi said children will be
educated to the dangers as well.
   Foreign experts will train Afghans who in turn will pass on their
knowledge to others, he said.
   Eventually, said Rizvi, an Afghan mine-clearing team would be
established in most villages or cluster of villages.

<HEAD>John Schlesinger Looks for Irony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the title character in his latest film,
``Madame Sousatzka,'' John Schlesinger doesn't see himself as a
teacher. The director would rather have audiences make up their own
minds.
   ``I hope there's plenty of irony in all my films. That's the very
thing I look for,'' said the British director of ``Midnight
Cowboy,'' ``Marathon Man'' and other acclaimed movies.
   ``It could all be disaster, but it isn't. That's kind of my
attitude to life. Most of the endings I've had, there is a question
mark. They're often about people determined to carry on.''
   ``Madame Sousatzka,'' based on the novel by Bernice Rubens, takes
place in London and stars Shirley MacLaine as a demanding, emotional
piano teacher whose philosophy, ``I teach how to live,'' is the
cause of much conflict with her students.
   Schlesinger originally sought a European actress to play the
Russian-born teacher, but wanted MacLaine after deciding to cast an
American.
   ``I liked the fact that she was willing to take risks,'' he said.
``I thought she brought quite a lot to `Terms of Endearment,'
looking dreadful. She's not worried about her Shirley MacLaine
image. I got to know that very fast.''
   Schlesinger credits MacLaine, whose work in ``Terms of
Endearment'' earned her an Academy Award for best actress in 1985,
with making the eccentric Sousatzka believeable.
   ``Sometimes when I worked on the script, I'd say, `Oh god, she's
too monstrous.' But she had a way of playing the eccentricities so
that it was totally part of her,'' the director said. ``She doesn't
play to the audience at all. I think it's a most extraordinary
performance.''
   For the part of Manek Sen, the 15-year-old prodigy who endures
Sousatzska's violent mood swings, Schlesinger auditioned hundreds of
actors before choosing newcomer Navin Chowdhry, who makes his film
debut in the movie. Chowdhry had no musical training, but
Schlesinger nevertheless found him perfect for the part. The
youngster worked with musical advisor Yonty Solomon.
   In a way, Irina Sousatzka can be likened to Nora Desmond, the
aging actress in ``Sunset Boulevard.'' Both are flamboyant on the
surface and lonely underneath. Desmond falls in love with a young
screenwriter, Sousatskza with Manek.
   ``It's a love story. She's created something and now she falls in
love with him,'' Schlesinger noted.
   ``She's a survivor. Even if she's angry or upset. I believe it
isn't so removed from people even if the subject is about music.
It's all about perfectly common human experience.''
   The 62-year-old Schlesinger's own musical background attracted
him to the story. His father was a cellist, his mother a violinist,
and Schlesinger himself was an accomplished pianist as a child.
   Schlesinger was a character actor in the 1950s, appearing on
stage, in television and films. He also made documentary shorts. His
first commercial film, ``Terminus,'' won the Golden Lion for best
documentary at the 1961 Venice Film Festival.
   ``A Kind of Loving,'' his first feature film, was released the
following year. Starring a then unknown Alan Bates, the film won the
Golden Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival and established
Schlesinger as one of England's most talented young directors.
   He then directed ``Billy Liar'' and ``Darling,'' which earned
Julie Christie the best actress Oscar in 1965. ``Midnight Cowboy,''
his first film made in Hollywood, earned Academy Awards for best
picture, director and best adapted screenplay in 1969.
   With Jon Voight as a Texan hustler and Dustin Hoffman as a
tubercular Bronx con man, ``Midnight Cowboy'' typified Schlesinger's
fascination with characters who are ``up against it.''
   Schlesinger sees that theme running strongly in ``Madame
Sousatzka.''
   ``In the case of Manek, he's up against the promise of success
and the possibility of failure which she has been up against,'' he
said. ``She's up against her past. She's up against it in many ways.
It makes her behave a certain way.
   ``They're all up against something. Changing London, changing
values.''
   Schlesinger has also directed Glenda Jackson in ``Sunday, Bloody
Sunday'' and Hoffman and Sir Laurence Olivier in ``Marathon Man.''
   ``Enthusiasm,'' the director says, is what he looks for from his
actors. MacLaine, he said, loved the role. ``She ... didn't care
about the money, was charming to everyone, particularly the boy. The
fact that's she's out banging the drum about the movie proves she's
enthusiastic.''
   And so is Schlesinger. He's merged his great loves, film and
music, and feels the movie expresses certain things he feels.
   ``It's communicating,'' he said. ``You're trying to invoke an
emotional response to something, to make them laugh or make them
angry as well as just telling a story.''

<HEAD>Ayn Rand Epic Makes It to American Cinema 46 Years Late</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Theasa Tuohy</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an adventure with almost as many twists and
plot turns as the movie itself, Ann Rand's ``We the Living'' is
about to make it to American theaters. The 46-year-old film was
thought to have been destroyed by Mussolini.
   ``We The Living'' was made in war-time Italy in 1942, and was
based on the novel of the same name by Ayn Rand, whose
``objectivism'' philosphy in such works as ``The Fountainhead'' and
``Atlas Shrugged'' made her a cult figure in the 1970s.
   The movie has caused such a stir over the years, and has
repeatedly won critical acclaim, from the Venice Festival of 1942 to
the Fourth Annual Boston Film Festival last month.
   A surface indictment of communism, the lushly photographed,
romantic saga is set in Russia as the tidal wave of revolution
boiled down to a new party system that meant enormous changes in the
way people lived and loved and survived.
   Rossano Brazzi co-stars as a tubercular aristocat who can't get a
job or a slot in a sanitarium because aristocrats are out of
fashion. He said he made arrangements for Rand to get her first look
at the film when he met her in Hollywood after the war. However, he
didn't think Italy's fascist government had ordered the movie to be
destroyed.
   It went out of circulation because the ``natural life of the film
was over,'' Brazzi said in a telephone interview from his home in
Rome.
   But Massimo Ferrara-Santamaria, a Rome lawyer who was general
manager of the studio where the movie was made, said he was called
before a fascist tribunal and ordered to destroy negatives and
copies of the film, and was stripped of his position at the studio
and as lecturer at Italian universities for his role in making the
movie.
   ``In the tragic Italian war situation, the film was called by the
public `Noi Morti' (`We the Dead'),'' he said in an interview,
adding that Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels banned the film
in Germany after Ferrara personally showed it at Goebbels' Berlin
home in October 1942.
   ``At the end of the screening, Goebbels told me that the Russians
were habitually presented to the German public in a much more
negative way than in this picture, and therefore it was no good for
Germany,'' he said.
   Erika and Henry Mark Holzer, the movie's producers, were Rand's
lawyers in the 1960s. Mrs. Holzer said the author believed the
banning story and authorized a search for the film that took the two
attorneys through hundreds of interviews and dusty archives. It
finally culminated two years later when they met a dealer with ``a
bunch of Italian films for sale.''
   They rode through the bumpy back streets of Rome with a load of
potentially explosive nitrate-treated film in the back of an old
truck, including the negative for ``We the Living.'' They had the
movie transferred to ``safety film'' before flying it back to New
York.
   Mrs. Holzer believes they found the original nitrate negative,
which Ferrara had hidden.
   Ferrara and others say Italy's Ministry of Culture ordered the
film destroyed about five months after its release on the grounds
that though the message might purport to be anti-communist, it could
also be taken as anti-totalitarian _ a strong statement for
individualism, regardless of political coloration.
   The fascists didn't want that kind of propaganda message playing
on the homefront with Italy's Axis troops stretched from North
Africa to Stalingrad, and the Allies storming the beaches of Sicily.
   Rand had a hard-line, libertarian philosophy. It was best
exemplified by Gary Cooper in the ``Fountainhead,'' who played an
architect who blows up his own creation rather than allow it to be
desecrated by the whims of popularism.
   Mrs. Holzer said Rand liked the film version of ``We the Living''
even more than ``The Fountainhead,'' although the author had written
the latter's screenplay herself and was not asked for permission for
the Italian film.
   Brazzi said it was a so-called war movie: ``We'll worry after the
war about paying for it.'' He said Rand eventually did receive
compensation from Scalera, the producing studio.
   Mrs. Holzer said that once she and her husband recovered an
original nitrate negative, Rand went through the film frame by frame
to identify exactly how she wanted it edited. The Italian version
was made in two parts and ran over 4{ hours. The project was set
aside when Rand had other commitments, and was not picked up until
after the author's death in 1982. The film was restored by Duncan
Scott.
   The epic was shot entirely on indoor, elaborately built Italian
war-time sets recreating Russian country scenes, trains, ships and
Petrograd.
   ``I'm told almost the entire White Russian community in Italy was
used as extras,'' Mrs. Holzer said.
   The new version, distributed by Angelika Films, is under three
hours, and is set for release Nov. 5 in Boston, Nov. 11 in Los
Angeles and Nov. 25 in New York. It will play to other major U.S.
markets before January.
   The film also stars a young and radiant Alida Valli, the female
lead in the 1949 British thriller, ``The Third Man''; and Fosco
Giachetti, who was the No. 1 box-office draw in Italy when the movie
was made, according to its producers.
   ``We the Living'' has a bit of soap opera in it: Beautiful Kira
loves Leo, the tubercular aristocat; Andrei of the dreaded secret
police loves Kira because she has the courage to be independent and
defiant of the new order.
   But underneath the suds is a hard reality: Kira forsakes her love
when he turns out not tough enough to toe a moral line. Andrei kills
himself when he realizes first that Kira used him to get Leo a spot
in a sanitarium, and that his adored party leaves no freedom for
individuals to decide whether they wish to be scoundrel or saint.
   Kira goes forward, wiser but unbowed, a testimony to the strong
and the living, and the survival of the toughest.
   Rand, who espoused a personal philosophy based on unfettered
capitalism and ``rational selfishness,'' held individual freedom as
the highest ideal. She said alturism was weakness, and blamed it for
much of the world's woes. But she also attacked libertarians of the
right who often identified with her philosophy.

<HEAD>Despite Paradoxes, Brecker Finds Niche as Solo Jazzman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN WINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After dazzling a nightclub audience
with his work on an ultramodern electronic wind instrument, Michael
Brecker went to his dressing room to audition a 40-year-old
saxophone that a friend had offered to sell.
   Such paradoxes make up the music of Brecker, a popular sessionman
who has played on more than 500 albums but is guiding his solo
career through its infancy.
   Brecker has lent his licks to albums by such diverse artists as
Frank Sinatra, Parliament-Funkadelic and Dire Straits, but his two
solo records are filled with lengthy improvisations and traditional
jazz sounds. He is known primarily for his studio work but loves to
perform live.
   As a horn man, his influences begin with the masters: jazz
saxophonists such as John Coltrane and Charlie Parker. A recent
favorite is blues guitarist Robert Cray, who won critical acclaim
last year with his hit record, ``Smoking Gun.''
   But to go from pop to funk to rock, from bebop to blues is not
unusual for the 39-year-old Brecker. ``My music is always heading in
a bunch of different directions,'' he said.
   With his brother, Randy, who plays trumpet, the tenor saxophonist
was one-half of the Brecker Brothers, who recorded several
successful albums of fusion pop in the 1970s. But Michael was 20
years into his career before he released a solo album, last year's
``Michael Brecker.'' The current tour that brought his quintet to
Fort Lauderdale is in support of his new record, ``Don't Try This at
Home.''
   ``The two albums are somewhat different but coming from sort of
the same place,'' Brecker said. ``They're both not at all commercial
in a pop sense.
   ``I really wanted to make a jazz record _ basically an acoustic
type record that was played fairly live in the studio with tunes
that were open to allow for a lot of improvisation. I wasn't trying
to employ gimmicks. I just wanted the music to speak for itself.''
   On stage and on his new record, Brecker brings a contemporary
flavor to the otherwise traditional sound with his electronic wind
instrument synthesizer, or EWI (pronounced ee-wee).
   The EWI is the length of a clarinet, but fatter and rectangular.
It has 10 octave keys and terrific dynamic range. Brecker can make
it sound like a keyboard, a guitar, cattle in distress and even a
saxophone.
   The EWI is likely to appall conservative jazz fans. Brecker likes
it for several reasons.
   ``I'm kind of a gadget freak. I've always liked electronic things
and was into synthesizers long before I was playing the EWI. It's
just a lot of fun to play,'' he said. ``And I use it as a writing
tool. It's just opened up another creative door for me.''
   But Brecker will always go back to the sax.
   ``It's become part of me,'' he said.
   Brecker hasn't done much session work lately and plans to
continue concentrating on his solo career. He likes the independence
and plans to make the most of it.
   ``The (next) recording is probably going to be somewhat more
electric, a little more funky. That's subject to change. But if I do
do something different, I expect to get a degree of lambasting,'' he
said with a chuckle.
   ``Hopefully the records are going to sell. But I'm not trying to
let that affect what I record.''

   Seething hatred of the Jews,
fanned by Adolf Hitler's propagandists, exploded 50 years ago in the
Nazis' well-coordinated night of ransacking, torching and beating
called ``Kristallnacht.''
   Boastfully dubbed Crystal Night by the Nazis because of the
sparkling shards of glass from thousands of smashed windows, that
single night of terror was also the dawn of the murderous seven-year
Holocaust.
   The Nazis eventually killed an estimated 6 million Jews and
hundreds of thousands of others they labeled ``undesirables.''
   Throughout the Third Reich on the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, Nazi
rampaged against Jews in major cities as well as those few left in
small towns after years of persecution.
   The balance of the terrifying destruction, according to official
Nazi count: 195 synagogues and 7,500 businesses destroyed, thousands
of homes ransacked. Officially, 36 Jews were slain, some as they
fled burning buildings. Other accounts, however, indicate that at
least 1,118 synagogues were vandalized and as many as 1,000 Jews
were killed or committed suicide.
   Thousands more Jews _ men, women and children _ were beaten. More
than 30,000 were arrested and shipped off to concentration camps in
the first major step in the systematic Nazi campaign to annihilate
European Jews.
   The action, which became known as the ``Night of Broken Glass''
in English, stunned the outside world and bluntly heralded the
Nazis' intentions to ``Aryanize'' society and business.
   Germans in both East and West have for months been making
elaborate plans to mark the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht,
including solemn ceremonies, panel discussions and new publications.
   Even half a century later, the memory of the terror haunts its
victims.
   Alfred Jachmann was an 11-year-old in the town of Arnswalde _ now
Choszczno in northern Poland.
   ``We were sleeping behind shutters with the windows closed,''
Jachmann recalled in an interview. ``We were jerked out of our sleep
by the crashing glass. We heard the screams: `The synaogue is
burning!'
   ``My father screamed, `Yes, the sky's all red!' We lived just 500
meters from the synagogue. We were hiding behind him for three
hours. We were shaking from fear and terror. Uniformed Nazis rushed
into our house. They arrested my father without saying a word,'' he
said.
   ``My sister, Gerda, and I were crying terribly,'' added the
61-year-old Jachmann, now head of the Jewish home for the elderly in
Frankfurt. ``My sister, mother and I had to leave Arnswalde within
three days.''
   Jachmann's mother, father and 13-year-old sister all died in the
Auschwitz concentration camp. Jachmann, also sent to Auschwitz,
later saved himself by plunging into the snow when Nazi
machine-gunners mowed down prisoners in January 1945.
   In what the Nazis called ``spontaneous anti-Jewish
demonstrations,'' Kristallnacht raged across the German Reich,
including Austria and the recently annexed Sudetenland region of
Czechoslovakia. In addition to homes, businesses and synagogues, the
Nazi gangs ransacked Jewish hospitals, orphanages and homes for the
elderly.
   In the city of Erfurt near Weimar, all Jewish men aged 18 to 80
were rounded up and forced into a local gymnasium.
   ``Some of the Nazis especially took to task Jews whom they
personally knew, to vent their fury on them,'' said local B'nai
B'rith president Harry Stern.
   ``We had to line up and march around to the sounds of the
Horst-Wessel song (a Nazi favorite). Then we were commanded to
scream `Death to the Jews'' and we had to do it,'' said Stern. Some
were savagely beaten with whips, he said.
   ``Then we were loaded into buses and brought to Buchenwald, where
we arrived at dawn,'' Stern recalled in historian Wolfgang Benz's
recently published book, ``The Jews in Germany 1933-45.''
   In other cities, Jews were herded into courtyards before the men
were separated from their families and sent to concentration camps.
   Valentin Senger, then a non-practicing Jew from a staunchly
Communist family, witnessed the outcome of Kristallnacht in
Frankfurt, where some of the worst violence took place.
   ``On the morning of the 10th, I went to the factory where I
worked, and on the way to the factory, I ran into a secretary. She
said: `Have you heard the synagogue is burning?''' he recalled.
   Senger described the mushroom cloud of smoke coming from the
direction of the Boerneplatz. When he reached the synagogue, he said
smoke was billowing from the roof, flames leaping through the
windows.
   ``Hundreds of people were standing nearby,'' he said. ``The area
was blocked off by police. The fire department was there, but they
weren't trying to put out the fire. They had instructions to let the
synagogue burn, but to keep nearby buildings from burning.
   ``I stood there and never heard any words of approval or applause
or bravos. The people looked stiffly and silently into the fire. No
one critcized it either. The fear was too great.
   ``That was the first time I felt I belonged to them, I belonged
there, that's my people. My synagogue was burning. I really felt
that I was a Jew,'' the 69-year-old retired journalist told the AP
in an interview. ``I saw they were rounding up the Jews and putting
them on trucks, that same day. The Jews were being mistreated and
beaten.''
   Senger survived in Frankfurt by hiding from the Nazis and using
false documents.
   Much to the annoyance of Nazi finance chief Hermann Goering,
Kristallnacht had an unforeseen and nearly disastrous impact.
   The damage, calculated at 25 million reichsmarks, worth about
$6.25 million, shocked German insurance companies. They noted that
just replacing the broken glass would hurt the Third Reich, since
the glass had to be imported with much-needed hard currency.
   ``I wish you had killed 200 Jews instead of destroying so many
valuables,'' Goering told Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi fanatic who
gave the Teletyped orders for Kristallnacht.
   Eventually, the Nazis confiscated the insurance proceeds and
slapped the Jews with a $250 million fine.
   Fifty years later, the anniversary is still creating conflict,
including debate over the best way to mark the day and the extent to
which government leaders should participate.
   Roman Catholic bishops from East Germany, West Germany and
Austria last month issued a joint statement that sharply questioned
Christian leaders' failure 50 years ago to publicly condemn the Nazi
night of terror. The bishops implied that Christian ``failings''
were partly responsible for the Holocaust.
   In September, Ignaz Bubis, leader of the Frankfurt Jewish
Community, stunned the government when he publicly urged Chancellor
Helmut Kohl to have President Richard von Weizsaecker write Kohl's
speech.
   Kohl has occasionally upset West German Jews with what they
consider insensitivity toward their concerns. Weizsaecker, on the
other hand, has gained the Jews' admiration for urging Germans to
face the Nazi past.
   West German Jews also frequently object to the word
Kristallnacht, saying it minimizes the atrocities that followed the
rampages. They prefer the term ``Pogrom Night.''
   When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Germany had 530,000 Jews.
About 32,000 Jews live in West Germany today. In East Germany, the
estimated number of practicing Jews is 450-600, with no permanent
rabbi.

   Adolf Hitler and his henchmen had for years been
targeting Jews for persecution, trying to force them out of the
Third Reich. By November 1938, they were looking for an excuse to
crack down more savagely.
   They found it when Herschel Grynszpan, a 17-year-old Jew enraged
by his family's deportation to Poland, shot and mortally wounded
German Embassy Third Secretary Ernst vom Rath in Paris on Nov. 7,
1938.
   Nazi leaders, in Teleptyped orders sent to local party heads
throughout the Reich, demanded brutal reprisals. In the Nazi capital
alone, seven main synagogues were burned in the hours of ransacking
and wanton violence.
   Here are brief descriptions of some of what happened in just nine
of the hundreds of other towns and cities where Nazi thugs ransacked
Jewish homes and businesses and burned synagogues on the night of
Nov. 9-10, 1938.

they go by.
   The Jews are shoved into the synagogue, where they are forced to
read aloud passages of Adolf Hitler's viciously anti-Semitic work
``Mein Kampf.''
   Later, as they are about to be forced onto buses for the trip to
Dachau concentration camp, the men hear the fateful words, ``Our
beautiful house of worship is in flames.'' Huge flames burst from
the stone building.

be any more Jews living in Germany. Jewish businesses also must be
destroyed.''
   Koester responds, ``Yes, but what's supposed to happen to the
Jews?''

   As in hundreds of other towns across
Nazi Germany, terror struck Jews in this picturesque village on the
infamous ``Kristallnacht.'' A half-century later, students there are
still confronting the Nazi past.
   Last month, the 23 students in Stephan Kolb's history class heard
a former Jewish resident describe the tensions that led up to the
brutality of Nov. 9-10, 1938.
   Later, in a roundtable discussion with The Associated Press,
students in this town of 11,400 people north of Frankfurt discussed
the night when thugs ransacked the homes of the 10 to 15 Jews who
lived in Usingen, then a rural village.
   Martin Stenzel, 18, said Kristallnacht, named for the sparkling
shards of broken glass that littered streets and sidewalks after the
vandalism, was a ``channeling of aggression'' against the Jews.
   Asked about constant reminders of Kristallnacht and other Nazi
atrocities, he said: ``There is the danger the Nazi era could be
disposed of, or settled in a way. But this history should always be
alive.''
   Stenzel also sees sharp differences among generations in West
Germany, which has paid more than 80 billion marks ($44 billion at
1988 values) to Nazi victims and their families.
   ``The older generation has kept the prejudiced view of Jews,'' he
said, adding that this wasn't true with younger generations.
   Sonja Moses, 20, said: ``I can well imagine there were feelings
of jealousy because the Jews were merchants and in general were
better off financially. But I just don't think it could happen
again. People are more broad-minded now. They wouldn't do it again.''
   None of the six students taking part in the Oct. 13 discussion at
the Christian-Wirth School was Jewish. All are working toward the
Abitur, the examination which grants a prestigious diploma roughly
equivalent to a junior college degree in the United States.
   Ms. Moses, like her classmates, also said the older generation
views the Nazi era far differently from today's younger Germans.
   ``My grandmother tells me that Hitler brought order to the
country,'' said Ms. Moses, adding that her grandmother dwells on the
chaos that plagued the Weimar Republic after World War I. ``She says
after Hitler came to power, it wasn't that way anymore. You could
walk down the street without being afraid.''
   Albrecht Pachl, 18, agreed the ``biggest danger'' was that the
legacy of the Nazis could eventually be put aside.
   But he, too, noted that some Germans think it is time to stop
dwelling on the past.
   ``Many people feel under attack, including from people outside
the country,'' Pachl said of Holocaust reminders.
   He said he remembered watching television documentaries as a
child.
   ``I had the feeling it was aimed at me as a German,'' Pachl said.
   Kerstin Dumke, 18, said of Kristallnacht violence, ``I can
imagine that some people were swept up by what was happening, even
if they didn't have any hatred for the Jews beforehand.''
   Like the others interviewed, Ms. Dumke has traveled to other
countries, and she said the Nazi past comes up there, too.
   ``There's less interest in what is happening today than what
happened in the past. It's something that you drag around with you
all the time,'' she said.
   The students had heard from Ernst Lilienstein, 67, an Usingen
native who emigrated a year before that terrible night. A retired
New York City educator, Lilienstein studied at the Christian-Wirth
School more than 50 years ago, according to the 42-year-old Kolb.
   ``For some of them, it was the first time they'd ever seen a Jew,
knowing it was a Jew. Certainly, it was the first time many had
really talked to a Jew,'' Kolb said.
   In a telephone interview from his home in New York City,
Lilienstein said of his meeting: ``I was amazed both at their lack
of knowledge about what really happened, but also at their interest
in questioning me.''

   The scope of death and destruction in the
Kristallnacht pogrom against the Jews of the Third Reich 50 years
ago was much broader than widely believed, an Israeli researcher
says.
   Vandals torched synagogues and smashed Jewish property the night
of Nov. 9-10, 1938. The next day, Nazi officials announced that 36
Jews had been killed and 195 synagogues destroyed. These figures are
still widely used in history books.
   But Jerusalem professor Meier Schwarz says he has uncovered
evidence that about 1,000 Jews were killed or committed suicide, and
that at least 1,118 synagogues were vandalized.
   Kristallnacht is considered the start of the Holocaust, the
systematic destruction of European Jewry by Nazi Germany. By the end
of World War II, the Nazis had killed 6 million Jews.
   ``For German Jews, it was the final sign that they no longer had
a place there,'' said the German-born Schwarz, the only member of
his family to survive the Holocaust. ``After the Kristallnacht, we
all understood what it means to be a target.''
   Schwarz said he began his research four years ago after being
angered by official indifference on a visit to his birthplace, the
southern German city of Nuremberg, once a hotbed of Nazism.
   ``I was at city hall, and asked some official why there was no
plaque to commemorate the Adas-Isroel synagogue where my family
prayed,'' said Schwarz. ``They told me it never existed.''
   Schwarz was 12 when he saw Adas-Isroel go up in flames on
Kristallnacht. Later that night, five Brown Shirts trashed the
Schwarz family apartment with axes and knives.
   The newspaper ``Nuernberger Zeitung'' wrote about the destruction
of Adas-Isroel, an ornate three-story building with tall arched
windows: ``A heap of broken benches and ritual equipment was set up
in the middle of the building which was then set on fire. The entire
building burned down.''
   Scenes like this were repeated throughout the Reich, mostly in
Germany and Austria.
   In Nuremberg, 15 stormtroopers broke into the apartment of Else
Dormitzer and her husband, Sigmund, smashing furniture.
   ``Later, several bandits returned and beat us both. They broke my
husband's nose with a steel rod,'' Mrs. Dormitzer wrote in an
account kept at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem. ``We
were pushed out into the street, our bodies covered with blood.''
   Hertha Hurtig said she had just seen a Nelson Eddy-Jeanette
MacDonald movie and was riding home on a streetcar in Breslau _
today's Wroclaw in Poland _ when she saw Brown Shirts smash display
windows.
   ``They spared my husband for two days, but on the third day he
did not return from work,'' Mrs. Hurtig, who now lives in Ramat Gan
near Tel Aviv, said in a telephone interview.
   Mrs. Hurtig's late husband was one of 30,000 Jews rounded up in
the days after Kristallnacht and sent to concentration camps.
   According to Schwarz, 500 Jews died on Kristallnacht, either
killed or pushed into suicide, and 500 more perished in
concentration camps in the following days.
   In addition, at least 1,095 synagogues were torched or vandalized
in Germany and 23 others in Austria, Schwarz said in an interview.
   The figures are the result of painstaking research. Using a 1932
guide to Jewish communities in Germany, Schwarz and a few volunteers
wrote letters to German municipal officials, asking for information
about the local synagogue and an account of what happened in each
town and village on Kristallnacht.
   About 60 percent of the municipalities responded. Schwarz also
received information from German-born Jews now living in other
countries.
   The Nazis tried to portray the rampaging as the result of popular
anger over the assassination of Ernst vom Rath, third secretary at
the German Embassy in Paris, by Hershel Grynszpan, a Polish Jew. Vom
Rath was shot Nov. 7 and died two days later.
   But Schwarz and other historians say a large-scale pogrom had
been planned for several months, with the Nazis waiting for the
right time to carry it out.
   Still, Schwarz said, German Jews, the most assimilated and
secular in Europe, were taken by surprise.
   ``They said, `We are Germans, and this will pass,''' Schwarz
recalled. ``They said, `The world will not keep quiet.'''
   As history knows, they were wrong.

   The flames that consumed synagogues across the
Third Reich 50 years ago still burn within hearts at Congregation
Habonim, where survivors of the Nazi assault on the Jews rebuilt
their lives and their faith.
   An altar is built of stones from synagogues demolished the night
of Nov. 9-10, 1938 _ Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass. A
charred Torah scroll hangs on the wall, its Hebrew characters
twisted as if in agony.
   The congregation is a monument as well. Rabbi Bernhard N. Cohn,
who escaped Germany as a teen-ager in 1937, estimates that more than
65 percent of the synagogue's members are survivors of the Nazi era.
   The synagogue was founded on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on
Nov. 9, 1939, precisely a year after Kristallnacht. Its name, Hebrew
for ``the builders,'' was a defiant answer to those who had
destroyed the synagogues, the shops, the homes and the comfortable
lives of German Jewry.
   ``Still, after 50 years, one cannot believe that any civilized
nation could do what was done,'' Lotte Marshall, Habonim's executive
director, said in an interview.
   She remembers seeing the synagogue of Mannheim aflame. She
recalls streets littered with glass, days spent hiding in her
family's home, the subsequent arrest of her brother and his
transport to the Dachau concentration camp.
   Mrs. Marshall gained her brother's release with forged papers.
She herself spent time in a concentration camp in France before
fleeing to America.
   Lotte Kahn, 76, also remembers.
   She and her husband were awakened by a 2:30 a.m. call from her
mother-in-law: ``Get out of your apartment right away, the furniture
is flying through the windows!''
   Mrs. Kahn took shelter with her parents while her husband set out
in search of a safer place, hoping the violence was isolated to
Dortmund. But chaos and Nazi hooligans were everywhere. He holed up
in a Protestant church and returned two days later.
   All the Jewish men of Dortmund were arrested, including Mrs.
Kahn's husband, father and uncle. Her menfolk were released in a
fortnight: ``If you ask me why they were let out ... I cannot tell
you to this day,'' she said.
   Ludwig Boettigheimer remembers the melancholy among Jews in
America.
   ``Too many of our people lost so much _ their parents, relatives,
friends were caught in Germany, and it became more and more obvious
that there was no way to get them out,'' said Boettigheimer, 80, a
Habonim founder who arrived in the United States in 1936. ``But
there was also a sense of hope. We were alive.''
   That hope was marshaled by Hugo Hahn, a charismatic rabbi who had
watched as Nazi marauders wrecked his Essen synagogue. Hahn and his
followers were determined that German Judaism would endure.
   Habonim started with three dozen founding members and services at
Manhattan's Central Synagogue. It drew some of Germany's leading
intellectuals, people like Martin Buber and Leo Baeck, to lecture
and teach. A prominent Bible expert from Frankfurt, Eduard Strauss,
came to Habonim and resumed his lessons at the precise point where
he had been interrupted by the Nazis.
   ``It grew by leaps and bounds, like wildfire,'' said
Boettigheimer. ``There was a need for prayer _ there always is in
time of trouble.''
   Membership swelled to 1,200. Separate services were conducted in
Queens, and Town Hall was rented for the High Holy Days.
   The German Jews began to assimilate. The amount of German spoken
at services diminished until it was eliminated in the 1950s; board
minutes were recorded in German for only a year or two. ``We tried
to hide our language,'' Boettigheimer explained.
   The end of the war brought numbing news of what had happened to
those left behind. Memorializing the dead became a major priority.
Each year, a Holocaust memorial service is held near the anniversary
of Kristallnacht.
   A wall of plaques records names of the dead: ``Tilly Jacobsen
perished in Theresienstadt March 1943.'' ``Emil and Lima Hertz,
Adolph, Rudolf and Herman Hertz, perished in Europe 1940-45.''
   Stones were collected from the synagogue ruins after the war;
nearly 30 years later, artist Emanuel Milstein incorporated them in
an altar as a monument to victims of the Holocaust.
   The charred Torah scroll was discovered in the gutter outside the
Essen synagogue the night after it was destroyed. It was sent for
safekeeping to a relative in Princeton, N.J., who gave it to
physicist Albert Einstein.
   Einstein, who had emigrated from Germany in 1933, displayed it
when he spoke on behalf of refugee relief. Eventually, it went to
Habonim.
   In a Queens cemetery, Habonim is about to dedicate a marble
column etched with victims' names. A brochure says, ``We will never
forget them, but let us be sure that those who come after us will
remember them, too.''
   The synagogue has had its struggles. Hahn, the synagogue's
founder and its heart, died in 1967, replaced by Cohn, his
son-in-law and an associate rabbi. Membership dropped to 600, and
religious school enrollment, once as high as 250, fell to 50. It is
60 this year.
   Habonim has attracted new, younger members, but they are in the
minority.
   ``These people don't die,'' Cohn said of the older members.
``Fiftieth wedding anniversaries are a dime a dozen in my
congregation.''
   But they do die, of course, and the congregation shrinks some
each year. The names of those who perished in Europe are read at the
annual memorial service; they are removed when their survivors die.
This year, there will be about 100 names.
   This does not sadden Boettigheimer.
   ``It is much sadder,'' he said, ``if you have a tremendous list.''

   Compared to the Nazi genocide that virtually
wiped out Europe's Jews, a night of window-smashing and arson would
seem a pale subject for a documentary.
   But ``Kristallnacht: The Journey from 1938 to 1988'' spotlights a
moment in history when history could have been changed. The world
was shocked, but did nothing, and Hitler's destruction of the Jews
went forward.
   The one-hour film will air over the Public Broadcasting Service
on Nov. 9, the 50th anniversary of ``crystal night,'' when
widespread Nazi attacks on synagogues and Jewish businesses and
homes littered the streets with shattered glass.
   ``It was Hitler's last test to see how the world would react, and
the world reacted with silence,'' said Ronald Lauder, who underwrote
the film through his Robert S. Lauder Foundation, a philanthropic
organization that aims to preserve European Jewish history and
culture.
   Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune, served as
ambassador to Austria from 1985-87, and was an outspoken critic of
anti-Semitism at a time when Austrians were electing former U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim as their president in spite of his
Nazi background.
   Lauder told a small group that gathered for a preview screening
of the documentary that its purpose was ``to teach us a lesson that
we have to speak out, speak out whenever there is any type of
bigotry government-sponsored, any type of religious persecution.''
   The film describes the events through rare pictures, including
never-before-seen amateur movies of the burning of a synagogue, and
interviews with survivors and witnesses. It later catches up with
present-day Austrians and Germans who have varying opinions on their
connection to the past.
   Kristallnacht is well-known in Europe, but Lauder said he was
chagrined to find out that only about 10 percent of Americans polled
by his foundation had ever heard of it.
   ``It became part of me when I was in Vienna,'' he said in an
interview. ``I began to realize all the different currents, why they
were happening. I also saw in Vienna there were very few synagogues
left. One of the major ones ... is today a parking lot. I realized
that this was a center of Jewish life, and there's a parking lot.
What happened?
   ``After Nov. 9, 1938, the world was never the same,'' Lauder
said. ``There was something different. People couldn't put their
finger on it, but it was different. It affects your life, it affects
my life, it affects all our lives. And that's why I did it. I wanted
people to understand it. And no matter how much I explained to
people when I travel what happened, I couldn't get it across.''
   For producer Robert Frye, a former ABC News producer, making
Lauder's film was a difficult project, since little visual material
was available.
   ``The Nazis didn't want any evidence of the widespread nature of
this,'' Frye said. He held little hope for film footage until
someone tipped him there was an amateur film sitting in a museum in
Germany.
   ``That began a three-four-month process,'' Frye said. ``No one
would tell us who owned the film. After leaving Austria on the
actual shoot, we drove to Munich and on the way found out ... that
the woman who owned the film lived near. So we knocked on the door
and completed the deal. It is, as far as I know, the only footage
that shows in motion picture terms what happened.''
   The film sets the scene through interviews with witnesses who
lived in Germany in 1935 as Hitler was rising to power and finding
little resistance to his propaganda campaign against Jews.
   A Polish family forced to leave Germany wrote a plaintive letter
to a son in Paris. To protest the persecution of his family,
17-year-old Herschel Grynzspan walked into the German Embassy and
shot a minor German official, Ernst vom Rath. Retribution for vom
Rath's death became an excuse for Kristallnacht.
   ``This was for good, we knew. The end of our normal life,''
recalls witness Paul Grosz.
   In present-day West Germany, Frye's cameras follow Israeli
professor Meier Schwarz on his quest to find evidence of the Jews
who once lived in the Germany of his boyhood. In Ansbach, he watches
workmen restoring a magnificent synagogue.
   ``The main thing is to restore what happened here,'' Schwarz
says. ``To make a memory for our parents.'' But he acknowledges
there is no one to worship in the synagogue. No Jews live in Ansbach
anymore.

   The Nissan Sentra is a tough little car with a
tough assignment.
   It has to battle both similarly priced subcompact cars and
lower-priced competitors. It works to attract both young singles of
moderate income and upscale parents and couples, Nissan says. And,
as the best-selling auto in the Nissan family, it's working to
bolster sales.
   The Sentra, which is imported from Japan for buyers in the
western United States and is shipped from Nissan's Smyrna, Tenn.,
plant to buyers in the eastern part of the country, has done a
commendable job.
   Redesigned for the 1987 model year, it was the eighth
best-selling nameplate in the United States with sales of more than
239,000. Also in the 1987 model year, it was rated No. 1 in quality
among subcompacts by the auto marketing research firm J.D. Power and
Associates of Westlake Village, Calif.
   For 1988, the Sentra continues to be a quality leader in
subcompacts, though it fell behind the Chevrolet Nova, Toyota
Corolla and Plymouth Colt in the 1988 J.D. Power survey of owners
who had their cars for 90 days.
   Also, a Nissan spokesman reports that sales are nearly flat for
calendar 1988. Through July, 123,625 Sentras were sold vs. 124,468
in the same period in 1987.
   The test car, a 1988 Sentra GXE sedan, had fine fit and finish
inside and out, except for the plastic fuel-cap holder on the fuel
filler door.
   The holder came right off when I tried to use it. But it also was
easy to put back on. I ignored it and put the cap on the car roof
while refueling.
   The car's interior was spartan and easy to live with. Dashboard
gauges were simple to read and seats were comfortable. Because it is
a subcompact, however, the Sentra offers a snug fit for three adults
in back, and legroom there also was tight.
   The trunk was flat and sizable, though it was covered with a thin
layer of material that tended to bunch up under luggage. Road noise
was moderate, and you can count on getting decent fuel economy.
   The engine, a 1.6-liter, fuel-injected four cylinder teamed with
three-speed automatic transmission, was a bit sluggish. There were
times when it chugged and the car jerked, trying to get in the right
gear. This was also when the air conditioner was on full blast.
   Base price for the GXE sedan with automatic transmission is
$10,844. Competitors include the Honda Civic sedan, which is priced
around $11,000 with automatic transmission, and the Hyundai Excel
sedan, which is priced around $7,400 with automatic transmission.
   Nissan says Sentra buyers have median age of between 30 and 39.
Median income is from $30,000 to just under $50,000. Many buyers are
couples and parents, and there also are a number of single females
who earn more than $50,000 annually, the company says.
   From 1982-86, the latest years available, Consumer Reports'
trouble survey of owners showed Sentras having average, better than
average or much better than average ratings.

<HEAD>Bush's Campaign Strategy: `I'm Not Going to Mess Up'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, relaxing on Air Force Two as it
raced across California, summed up his campaign strategy in just six
words: ``I'm not going to mess up.''
   Once, twice, three times, four times _ he said it over and over
within a period of a minute. It was as if he had been reciting the
same sentence to himself for months, rehearsing a simple formula for
winning the White House.
   ``I can't look back and I can't look forward beyond Nov. 8,
either _ unifocus,'' Bush said.
   By all appearances, the man given to gaffes has succeeded in not
messing up.
   A loser in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses, he rallied to
bring the primary season to a surprisingly early close.
   Down by 17 points in the polls in late July, he climbed back up,
methodically following a game plan that eventually gave him a wide
lead over his rival.
   He didn't loose his focus, either. Simply put, it was to paint
Dukakis as an incorrigible liberal, an inexperienced governor whose
leadership could not be trusted.
   ``Do not gamble on another liberal Democrat coming out of
nowhere,'' Bush warned audiences.
   Emphasizing that Republicans have brought peace and prosperity,
Bush said Dukakis wasn't up to dealing with the Soviet Union and he
was sure to raise taxes.
   Bush concentrated his time and resources on nine battleground
states: California, Texas, Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Missouri.
   In the process, he surprised a lot of people.
   Once considered weak and awkward on the stump, he instead was
tough and aggressive, willing to wage what was widely viewed as a
negative campaign.
   He wasn't a wimp.
   He seemed confident and poised. In televised debates with
Dukakis, Bush came across as steady and relaxed _ a far cry from the
nervous, hyperactive performance he turned in four years earlier in
a debate with then Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine
Ferraro.
   Of course, there were occasional foul-ups. His biggest miscue was
saying that Sept. 7 _ instead of Dec. 7 _ was the anniversary of the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Mixing up his words on another
occasion, he said, ``I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism,
anti-racism.'' He quickly had aides assure people he was not an
anti-Semite.
   George Herbert Walker Bush, scion of the late Connecticut senator
and New York financier Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush, was
born to a life of privilege in Greenwich, Conn.
   Bush amassed a fortune in his own right in the oil fields of
Texas, and then followed his father's lead and built up an
impressive resume of public service: member of Congress, ambassador
to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican Party, director of
the Central Intelligence Ageny, vice president. Still, Bush had not
won an election in his own right since 1968.
   He lost _ badly _ in the first event of the 1988 presidential
campaign, the Iowa caucuses, but then regrouped and came back in New
Hampshire. Then, after losses in South Dakota and Minnesota, Bush
jumped ahead of the pack and virtually locked up the GOP
presidential nomination with 16 primary wins on Super Tuesday.
   Lingering questions about Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair
threatened to derail his presiential aspirations, as did a
perception that he was not his own man.
   Even his selection of a running mate created controversy, and
Bush was forced to defend Dan Quayle throughout the fall campaign.
   In the end, though, it didn't seem to matter.
   Bush's aides said the turning point was the Republican convention
in August, when there was, in effect, a transfer of leadership and
Bush stepped out of President Reagan's shadows.
   Bush played two roles: sweet and sour, good cop and bad cop. He
slashed deeply at Dukakis. At the same time, he portrayed himself as
a family man interested in family values and ``a gentler, kinder
nation.''
   Like Ronald Reagan's campaign before his, Bush's was not loaded
with bold, new initiatives. He did not veered from the course of the
last eight years. ``When you have to change horses in midstream,
doesn't it make sense to switch to the one who's going in the same
way?,'' Bush asked.
   There were few specifics about how a Bush administration would
work.
   Bush's answer to the huge budget deficit? A ``flexible freeze''
that provided no clues about where he would cut spending.
   His campaign was loaded with ``feel good'' themes _ balloons,
children, sun-drenched wheat fields _ similar to those Reagan used.
Indeed, his commercials were made by the same team that produced
Reagan's successful ``Morning in America'' advertisements in the
1984 presidential race.
   And if Bush's speeches sometimes sounded like Reagan's, no
wonder. The vice president hired former White House speechwriter
Peggy Noonan, one of Reagan's top wordsmiths, for his own campaign.
   Bush's commercials hammered Dukakis as soft on crime, weak on
defense and on the wrong side of environmental issues, such as the
cleanup of the Boston Harbor _ echoing themes that Bush sounded on
the campaign trail.
   Pollster Lou Harris said, ``The Bush commercials have had an
enormous impact. Really more than the debates, more than anything
else, they have determined the set of the election up until now.''
   Ben Wattenberg, an American Enterprise Institute senior fellow,
said, ``They went after Dukakis on all the L-word (liberal) stuff,
which they had some nice symbols for, prison furloughs and Pledge of
Allegiance and ACLU and stuff like that.''
   Republican political consultant David Keene said, ``Bush seized
on issues of little substance (such as) the Pledge of Allegiance,
prison furloughs ... that created a caricature Dukakis couldn't
escape from.'' In this way, Keene said, Bush changed the public
perception of Dukakis.
   Democrats accused Bush of fanning racial tensions by emphasizing
the case of Willie Horton, a black man who raped a white woman after
escaping from a Massachusetts prison while on furlough. As governor
of Massachusetts, Dukakis had defended granting furloughs to
murderers.
   ``There isn't any racism,'' Bush said.
   Bush also hit Dukakis for being in favor of gun control and
abortion.
   By focusing on the hot-button issues, Bush hoped to win over the
swing voters _ the Democrats who voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984
but might go home in 1988.
   As the race drew to a close, polls showed Bush significantly
ahead of Dukakis.
   ``Guy asked me yesterday, `Are you overconfident?' There's no
sense of overconfidence. It's more, you know, keep on moving,'' Bush
said. ``I'm going to run like I'm 10 points back all across this
country.''

<HEAD>`Silver Spoon' Past, Experience Cloud Quayle Candidacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP)_ Dan Quayle's vice presidential campaign has been
haunted by his past, doubts about his qualifications and the
perception he has led an easy life in which the truly tough problems
were solved by mom and dad.
   Controversy marred his elevation from relative obscurity to the
national spotlight as George Bush's running mate. And it stymied his
attempt to show the country he was more than ``just a pretty face.''
   The notion that the Indiana senator was born with the proverbial
silver spoon, never having to struggle for money or power, is borne
out by his past. As Quayle once told an interviewer, ``Life has been
very good to me. I never had to worry about where I was going to
go.''
   Quayle, 41, has constantly had to defend himself against charges
he is unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. In
response, he touts his chief accomplishments in 12 years in
Congress: co-authorship of a job training act and detailed work on
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty and other arms-control
issues.
   Before his Oct. 5 debate with Democratic vice presidential
nominee Lloyd Bentsen, Quayle frequently added another point, saying
he has about the same legislative experience that John F. Kennedy
had when he sought the presidency in 1960. That line was dropped
after Bentsen's devastating rebuke: ``Senator, you're no Jack
Kennedy.''
   Quayle denounced as ``side-events'' questions about his military
service, academic record and personal life, but his campaign has
never completely escaped them. Signs reading ``Chickenhawk,'' ``Who
died in your place, Danny?'' and ``Sissy Rich Kid'' confront him
from one state to another.
   Quayle's grandfather was the conservative, self-made publishing
magnate, Eugene C. Pulliam. In 1955, at the age of 8, Quayle and his
family moved from his native Indianapolis to Phoenix, where his
father, James, ran Pulliam newspapers and joined the John Birch
Society. The Quayles returned to Indiana in 1963 and his father
became publisher _ and young Dan eventually became associate
publisher _ of The Huntington Herald-Press.
   Quayle has spent a good part of the campaign of 1988 explaining
how he spent the 1960s. Drugs were ``totally unbeknownst to me,'' he
said, and while that may seem ``a sheltered life, ... that's a life
in the Midwest ... a life in a small town in Indiana.''
   His performance at DePauw University was average. Graduating in
1969 during the Vietnam War, Quayle would have been eligible for the
draft but instead sought admission to the National Guard. He
explained to reporters that he did ``what any normal person would do
... call home to mother and father and say, `I'd like to get in the
National Guard.'''
   One of Congress' more ardent hawks, Quayle insists he wasn't
trying to dodge the draft _ just to be able to attend law school _
and that no undue pressure was applied to get him into the Guard.
Guard officials said there were openings even in the public
relations unit he joined. But a retired major general acknowledged
that he asked that a space be held for Quayle after a retired Guard
commander _ a Pulliam employee _ called to recommend him.
   The future politician also had to do some explaining about how he
managed to get into Indiana University School of Law when his grades
clearly were lacking.
   James Quayle said his son was able to convince the law school
that he was qualified on grounds his undergraduate education at the
small, private DePauw was more intense than might have been
available at a public institution.
   Young Quayle was accepted into law school after meeting with the
admissions dean, a Republican judge in Lebanon, Ind., where the
family owns the local paper. The same judge would later marry Quayle
and his wife, Marilyn Tucker, who met in law school and wed after a
10-week courtship.
   After questions were raised this summer about his academic
background, Quayle acknowledged he had never been an exemplary
student but refused to release his law school records. He deemed
them irrelevant to the campaign and contended ``no rules were
broken'' to get him admitted.
   During the campaign, Quayle was peripherally touched by an old
scandal. Former Washington lobbyist Paula Parkinson claimed he had
propositioned her on a 1980 golf outing in Florida when she was
staying in a vacation house with several lawmakers, including
Quayle. Quayle angrily denied the accusation and said he had been
there only to play golf.
   His often-stilted delivery and early avoidance of the press
contributed to the image of a shaky political newcomer tightly
controlled by Bush headquarters. His wife was especially protective,
pulling his sleeve or abruptly saying, ``Thank you, senator'' to end
press encounters.
   When, two months into the campaign, Quayle declared his
independence from his ``handlers,'' reporters were skeptical. The
candidate turned affable and accessible _ but he didn't abandon the
mission that the party had laid out for him: to portray Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as a liberal out of touch with
mainstream America.
   While Democrats have preyed on voter doubts about Quayle's
qualifications _ polls suggested he was a drag on the ticket _ he
did not attempt to dispel the idea he could be president one day. In
fact, Quayle says that at one point he talked with his wife about
running for president himself this year.
   ``It was a very casual discussion,'' he added.

<HEAD>Democrats' No. 2 Had to Fight Liberal Label Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen knew what it was to
run against the ``liberal'' label and tough negative advertising
long before he was chosen to be Michael Dukakis' running mate. He is
using that experience in a late effort to take the edge off the
Bush-Quayle campaign.
   Bentsen, a 67-year-old native Texan, was at first shy about
directly attacking GOP presidential nominee George Bush, whom he
considered a friend. Now, judging that two months of negative
Republican advertising has damaged the Democrats, Bentsen has taken
off the gloves.
   In an Oct. 18 speech in Los Angeles, he made the GOP ads the
central focus of his own campaign, unleashing a blistering attack on
the Republicans and their effort to destroy Dukakis' character.
   ``What happened _ almost without notice _ is an utterly vicious
assault of distortion and character assassination'' carried out by
Republicans spending ``millions of dollars on television cutting him
up,'' Bentsen said. ``They don't seem to mind if what they say is
untrue ... misleading ... downright mean.''
   Little of the GOP fire has been directed at Bentsen. Instead,
Bush and running mate Dan Quayle have zeroed in on Dukakis, taunting
him at every turn as a liberal. Bentsen, hre a grand jury in Suffolk County,
where Profeta's church is located, and answered questions about her
former pastor. Her lawyer said that the grand jury was investigating
matters that included a break-in at her Long Island apartment last
year and ``the whole Jim Bakker thing.''
   According to today's indictment, Profeta tried to get Ms. Hahn to
lie to the grand jury about gifts she received from him, including
fur coats, casino trips, hotel stays, jewelry, apartment rent and
automobile payments.
   Since the publicity about her involvement with Bakker, Ms. Hahn
has been featured in Playboy pictorials and interviews and stayed at
the Playboy mansion in California.
   Albany County Judge Joseph Harris issued the protection order for
Ms. Hahn at Crusco's request, despite contentions by Profeta's
lawyer that such an order would add to a ``media circus''
surrounding the case and deprive Profeta of a fair trial.
   Attorney John Gross said the order implied that the witness
tampering allegations against the minister were true.
   Harris replied there was no such implication and that Profeta
would receive a fair trial.
   Profeta, dressed in a pinstripe suit, lavender shirt, striped tie
and ankle-high boots, offered no comment as he was led out of the
courtroom and taken to a holding cell in the courthouse. His lawyer
refused to discuss the case.
   ``These charges represent a scheme to cheat the state and all
law-abiding taxpayers,'' said state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
``But more importantly, Rev. Profeta allegedly abused the
not-for-profit status of a religious organization for his own
personal gain.''
   In setting $25,000 bail, Harris said he wanted assurances from
Gross that the money wasn't from church funds. Gross had argued that
no bail was needed while Crusco asked for $100,000 bail.
   ``This man has been a minister for over 30 years,'' Gross said.
``He's got a congregation of over 1,000. There is no proof to these
charges.''
   Glenda Profeta, 41, had her case postponed until next month. She
is recuperating at home from an infection she contracted after
surgery, Gross said.
   The Profetas each face a maximum of four years in prison on
charges of tax evasion and offering a false instrument for filing,
the most serious charges against them.

<HEAD>Reagan Seizing Every Opportunity to Put in a Good Word for Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether campaigning around the country or
hosting an official White House event, President Reagan is seizing
on every opportunity to plug George Bush's candidacy and warn
Americans against sending a ``liberal'' to the White House.
   Academics and political experts differ on the extent to which the
presidential race between Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis is a
referendum on Reagan's nearly 8-year-old presidency. And they
disagree about Reagan's impact on the electorate.
   But no one questions the 77-year-old president's sincerity in
waging a tireless campaign on behalf of his vice president.
   ``I think he's made the whole Republican Party learn and remember
the experience of 1960,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of
Virginia governmental studies scholar. ``He's doing for Bush what
(Dwight D.) Eisenhower wouldn't do for (Richard M.) Nixon.''
   Since Labor Day, Reagan has traveled to 13 states, the bulk of
them in the tossup Midwest, and has raised $8.8 million for local
and state Republican parties and congressional candidates. He's
picked up the tempo in the waning days of the campaign, with a
whirlwind tour of California and visits to such border states as
Arkansas, Maryland and Missouri.
   Wherever he goes, Reagan delivers a standard stump speech,
telling Americans they'd be risking their future by electing Dukakis
as his successor. He sprinkles stump speeches with the word
``liberal.''
   Most of all, Reagan has reveled in the many appearances he has
made at high schools and college campuses, predictably invoking Gen.
George C. Marshall's quote about ``the best blankety-blank kids in
the world.''
   Standing in a corner of the hardwood floor in the Western
Kentucky University fieldhouse on Oct. 21, Reagan launched a gift
basketball in the direction of a basket. While some 12,000 young
people roared, he missed, missed again, and then bounced one in off
the backboard.
   His most enthusiastic receptions have come from young people such
as those in Kentucky, many of whom flashed ``We Love Ronnie'' and
``Thanks Mr. President'' signs.
   ``He has an infectious way about him,'' mused Kentucky Republican
Party Chairman Bob Gable. ``Clearly, they understood him. I have to
think the kind of exuberance you saw there will translate into Bush
as his successor.''
   ``I think he loves it,'' said White House political aide Frank
Lavin, who said Reagan has appeared at 21 campaign events since
Labor Day, including one with Bush in Houston, and has appeared at
several events for Republican Senate candidates.
   Reagan's top aides have said that the election of Bush is just
one of Reagan's campaign goals. He believes that it must be
accompanied by some major GOP strides in Congress.
   White House chief of staff Kenneth M. Duberstein, discussing
Reagan's political role before a Chamber of Commerce audience, said
the president wants to push GOP candidacies at the local level ``to
encourage fair reapportionment by increasing Republican
representation in state legislatures.''
   Speaking of Reagan's influence in the campaign, Brookings
Institution presidential scholar Stephen Hess said, ``We can't have
a controlled experiment because we don't know what it would be like
if he sat on the sidelines. But clearly, there's an awful lot of
referendum in this election.''
   Hess said that Bush has not taken policy stands that are
``measurably different'' from Reagan's, and thus the president has a
right ``to claim credit, in fact most of the credit'' if Bush beats
Dukakis on Nov. 8.
   ``To that degree, he's (Reagan) an important factor because he's
incredibly popular. It's phenomenal for a president in his eighth
year to have 60 percent approval ratings.''
   Richard Wiener, chairman of the Democratic Party in Michigan,
disagreed.
   Unimpressed by Reagan's foray earlier this month to the
blue-collar enclave of Macomb County, and by the president's appeal
to the so-called ``Reagan Democrats,'' Wiener said, ``I don't think
the visit made much of a difference once way or another.''
   ``We saw that in both 1984 and 1986, when he had no coattails
here,'' Wiener said.
   But Michigan GOP Chairman Spencer Abraham said he thought Reagan
had been fortunate to be able to take such a high-profile role in
Bush's presidential campaign, noting that Lyndon Johnson in 1968
``had become a political liability'' and that he likely could not
have been used in Hubert H. Humphrey's behalf, even if both men had
wanted that.

   Judging by some of the television ads the
presidential candidates are running, Americans have a choice this
fall between a dangerously naive fringe liberal and an incompetent
liar with bad judgment.
   This year's television drive, with each candidate planning to
spend more than $30 million, is not only the most expensive but
arguably the most negative in the modern history of presidential
campaigning.
   On the sunny side, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis is vowing
that he's ``on your side'' while Vice President George Bush swears
that he's ``ready on day one to be a great president.''
   But Republican Bush is also asserting in his ads that ``America
can't afford'' the risk of a Dukakis presidency. And Democrat
Dukakis is belittling not only Bush's competence and judgment, but
lately his veracity as well.
   While the 30-second spot reigns supreme as Election Day
approaches, particularly in battleground states, the candidates are
also purchasing network time for longer appeals to the nation's
couch-potato contingent.
   Dukakis gave two five-minute TV speeches in October and planned
two more for Nov. 1 and Nov. 5. He and Bush each have bought a
half-hour of time on the three major broadcast networks on election
eve.
   Dukakis, the underdog, also was seeking opportunities for
extended television interviews in an attempt to persuade voters to
give him another look before making up their minds. In one four-day
period he appeared on two network morning news programs, Larry
King's talk show on Cable News Network, for 90 minutes on ABC's
``Nightline,'' and for 14 minutes of CBS' ``Evening News'' half-hour
newscast.
   Bush's advertising has taken a double-barreled approach from the
start.
   One set of ads presented the soft-sell: Bush the family man with
his grandchildren; Bush the leader with foreign affairs experience;
Bush amid balloons and cheers at the GOP convention insisting he
wants ``a kinder and gentler nation.''
   ``The vice president spelled out his vision of America and we
reinforced it,'' said veteran media consultant Roger Ailes, who
heads the Bush ad team.
   A second set of ads was used in an attempt _ successful, polls
indicate _ to demolish the positive impression many voters had of
Dukakis immediately after the Democratic National Convention.
   One ad charged that Dukakis made a $6 billion mistake by failing
to clean up Boston Harbor. Another said he gave ``weekend passes to
first-degree murderers who were not even eligible for parole,''
opposes the death penalty and vetoed mandatory jail sentences for
drug dealers.
   More-recent spots attacked Dukakis' tax and furlough policies as
well as his stands on various defense matters. One showed inmates
walking in and out a revolving door and said that ``while out, many
committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape, and many are still
at large.'' Another showed Dukakis riding on a tank while a narrator
said he opposed ``virtually every defense system we developed.''
   The tank ad implied Dukakis opposed a long list of weapons, some
of which he is on record as supporting, and provoked an unusually
quick response from a campaign widely criticized for failing to
defend itself.
   ``Full of lies, and he knows it,'' Dukakis said of the tank ad in
an ad of his own. ``I want to build a strong defense; I'm sure he
wants to build a strong defense. So this isn't about defense issues;
it's about dragging the truth into the gutter.''
   Dukakis also struck back on the furlough front with several radio
and television ads, one of them charging that Bush ``has taken a
furlough from the truth.'' The spot notes that the Massachusetts
program was started by a Republican governor and says ``thousands of
drug kingpins'' were released under a federal furlough program while
Bush led the war on drugs _ including one ex-inmate who raped and
murdered a pregnant mother of two.
   Along the way Dukakis has also released TV spots attacking Bush's
record on drugs, education, Social Security and the environment, his
role in the Iran-Contra affair and his choice of Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle as his running mate. He has released ads of himself talking
simply into the camera about day care, education and America's
economic status in the world. And he's run a series of ``packaging
of George Bush'' ads designed to depict Bush as a creature of his
handlers.
   The disjointed nature of Dukakis' media campaign has reflected
confusion and friction in his advertising ranks as well as the lack
of a basic message for his candidacy. But his ads have become
feistier and more focused as his poll standings fall, honing in on
economic populism and championing middle-class causes.
   ``There is an overarching theme,'' maintains Dukakis ad chief
David D'Alessandro. ``Michael Dukakis is on the side of the majority
of the people.... His theme is that we must regain our stature and
our ability to perform as a country.''

<TEXT>
   The morning of Nov. 10, 1938, Fritz
Kleinmann saw synagogues aflame. By afternoon, the 15-year-old boy
and his father had been arrested and beaten by Nazis. Within months,
Fritz, his father and thousands of other Austrian Jews were deported
to the Buchenwald concentration camp.
   In April 1945, Kleinmann was freed from the dreaded Mauthausen,
the third death camp in his ghoulish odyssey through Nazi terror. He
weighed just 77 pounds.
   Today, Kleinmann, 65, a slender, quick-witted man, sits in his
apartment in a nondescript tenement bloc in suburban Vienna and
recalls how his terror began on the night now called Kristallnacht:
   ``In the morning of Nov. 10, we saw two synagogues burning in the
Leopoldstadt (then a largely Jewish district of Vienna). Then we
waited for the knock on the door.
   ``In the afternoon I was arrested. So was my father. After I was
maltreated at police headquarters ... I was allowed to go home
because I was only 15.''
   A day later, police released Kleinmann's father, who two decades
earlier had been seriously wounded and decorated as a soldier in the
Austro-Hungarian army.
   Those World War I decorations did not impress the Nazis when
Kleinmann and many of his family were deported the next year.
   ``Half of my family were gassed, including one sister and my
mother,'' Kleinmann said. Another sister and a younger brother
escaped and ended up in the United States, where they still live.
   ``They burned synagogues and other places of worship. It was
terrible ... howling people were standing by,'' screaming
anti-Semitic slogans, Kleinman recalled.
   ``The firefighters arrived all right, but they were under orders
not to extinguish the synagogue fires. They protected nearby
buildings from catching fire until the Jewish temples were burned
out.''
   Speaking the broad German dialect of the Viennese working class,
Kleimann said the officially endorsed pogrom was a welcome
opportunity for many Viennese to vent their anti-Semitism. They
looted and stole from Jews, humiliated and mistreated them.
   ``The terrible thing was that our neighbors, my friends, my
father's friends, were among those beating us, vilifying us,
spitting at us. Young people who had been my playmates were suddenly
Nazis who turned against us,'' he said.
   Unlike in Germany, the Nazis in Vienna, then home to some 200,000
Jews, did not wait for Kristallnacht to start burning and
ransacking. Existing Nazi documents and data in Vienna's fire
department show numerous Jewish temples were devastated in October
that year.
   On Oct. 16, firemen were called to extinguish a fire involving
the Community Temple, records show.
   According to a report on Kristallnacht by Austrian Jews, some
7,800 people were arrested and an unknown number killed in Vienna
alone. The detained were taken to so-called collection camps and
brutally treated, while 4,083 Vienna shops were plundered, the
report found.
   Some 680 people, many of them Jews, committed suicide on Nov.10
and subsequent days, said the report by intellectuals, camp
survivors and members of the Jewish community.
   Many synagogues, some of them local landmarks, were completely
gutted, with mobs throwing hand grenades to set them ablaze.
   It was only this year that Vienna city authorities unveiled
plaques to mark remind citizens of the sites where synagogues stood
50 years ago. But Kleinmann and the few who survived the Holocaust
never forgot.
   It took only three weeks after the Nazi Anschluss of March 1938
for Kleinmann to lose his apprenticeship in house decorating, his
father's trade.
   Like tens of thousands of others, he was jobless because he was a
Jew. His family was too poor to emigrate and survived on meals from
a Jewish relief service.
   At first, Aryan friends helped Kleinmann's father survive,
slipping him illegal work. Soon, the help turned to scorn and
insults.
   Kleinmann's two sisters were often picked up by Nazi patrols,
mostly former friends, for ``rubbing,'' the practice of forcing Jews
to rub walls, pavements and cobblestone roads to remove painted
slogans predating the Nazi annexation.
   ``I remember that one day I asked a former friend why he was
picking up my sister,'' Kleinmann said. ``He said he was ordered to
get hold of the girl by a Nazi cell foreman, whom she had once
refused to kiss in the doorway.''

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Underlying Algeria's recent violent
demonstrations is an economic crisis blamed in large measure on the
plummeting price of oil.
   Almost 95 percent of Algeria's export earnings come from
petroleum, and the value of these exports has fallen by more than 40
percent since 1981, from $14.1 billion to $8.4 billion last year.
   If movements in the dollar's value and world inflation are taken
into account, the real purchasing power of these earnings now is
barely one-third of what it was eight years ago.
   The drop in prices was particularly hard on this North African
nation because it was in the middle of several huge development
projects. The current account balance, which had shown a surplus of
more than $1 billion in 1985, fell $1.48 billion into the red in
1986.
   Meanwhile, Algeria's population is among the fastest growing in
the world. Since 1980, the country has grown by 25.6 percent, from
18.7 million people in 1980 to nearly 24 million today. The
population has more than doubled since the country won independence
from France in 1962.
   About 60 percent of the country is younger than 20, and many of
these people took to the streets in October to protest the falling
standard of living, rising unemployment, inflation and food
shortages _ all related to the sharp drop in oil revenue.
   More than 150 people were killed, hundreds were injured and an
estimated 3,000 people were arrested in nearly a week of
demonstrations that rocked the capital and many smaller towns.
   The riots prompted apparent government reforms. President Chadli
Bendjedid, who came to power in 1979, announced a Nov. 3 referendum
on what reporters describe as ``broad democratization.''
   Algeria is only the latest victim of violence prompted by falling
oil prices. Other countries, including Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia,
have suffered similar unrest and upheaval.
   An International Monetary Fund report published in 1987 noted
that the drop in the prices of oil and other raw materials cost
Third World countries nearly $100 billion in 1986. The loss of
revenue came against a backdrop of sharply declining international
lending to developing countries.
   Algeria is committed to a program of ``trade not aid'' and is
seeking to win back revenues by substitute other exports such as
uranium.
   The country has declined rescheduling payments on its $20 billion
foreign debt. Servicing costs swallow up nearly 60 percent of its
export revenue.
   Algeria also imports most of its food at a cost of more than $1
billion a year.

<HEAD>Networks to Project Winners As State Polls Close</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 3 grafs to CLARIFY effects of landslide. SUBS 8th

   The three major networks will project a winner in
the presidential race state-by-state as polls close, but refrain
from declaring a winner overall until West Coast voters cast their
ballots _ unless there is a landslide.
   If one candidate racks up enough electoral votes for victory,
based on projections in states where polls have already closed, the
networks will not refrain from stating the obvious.
   ``We're not going to tell the viewer that she has to sit there
with a calculator and add it up,'' said Michael Gartner, the new
president of NBC News.
   ABC, CBS and NBC will pre-empt entertainment programming on
Election Night, Nov. 8, and begin coverage with their 7 p.m. EST
newscasts.
   CNN, which as a policy does not project election winners, will
run its election coverage from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m. PBS will have
updates throughout the evening.
   The controversy over network projections arose in 1980, when
California residents reportedly walked off lines at polling places
when they heard the networks project Ronald Reagan as the winner
over Jimmy Carter. Theoretically, the outcome of close state and
local races could have been affected.
   In fact, Carter conceded the election hours before polls closed
on the West Coast.
   But the controversy prompted Congress to consider legislation
setting a national uniform poll-closing time. The heads of the news
divisions of ABC, CBS and NBC testified in 1985 in favor of the law
and gave its sponsors a handshake agreement that they would not
project winners until polls closed.
   NBC reignited the controversy this year when it ``characterized''
the outcome of the New Hampshire primary before the polls had
closed. Lawrence K. Grossman, then head of the news division, said
the network might not abide by the agreement come November if
Congress did not enact the poll-closing legislation, which it has
not done.
   Under Gartner, who took over the news division this summer, NBC
has the same policy as the other networks, and all refuse to
withhold projections of winners state-by-state.
   ``A common poll-closing time would solve it because the only
other way to do it is to say to a news organization, `What you know
you cannot report, what you know as a fact you cannot report,' and
that's a bad thing,'' David Burke, CBS News' new president said
recently.
   ``... Assume at 11 o'clock at night I have the whole eastern
seaboard as a fact. It isn't a projection. I can't withhold it, even
if I wanted to.''

<HEAD>Production Stops at Nuclear Weapons Plants amid Firestorm of
Criticism</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety problems at aging federal nuclear
weapons plants are reaching a critical mass.
   Production has stopped at major sites, and Energy Department
officials face a firestorm of criticism from Congress, the Pentagon
and angry citizens in the 13 states where the complex operates.
   ``Tell the truth!'' an irate crowd shouted last week as the
manager of the Energy Department's Rocky Flats Plant, near Denver,
argued that the plant's plutonium reprocessing facility was closed
because of a single contamination incident. Investigators from
Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency had found ``very
serious'' and repeated safety violations.
   ``We may sometimes not be good at explaining everything,''
responded the manager, Earl Whiteman. ``But we damn well tell the
truth.''
   Department officials are likely to face a lot more disbelief as
they struggle to restart nuclear reactors that produce the plutonium
and tritium needed for the nation's nuclear arsenal.
   Neither is being produced now and tritium, a radioactive isotope
of hydrogen, may be in critically short supply as early as next
summer, according to congressional sources.
   Federal officials also are likely to face rising anger as they
grapple with the daunting task of cleaning up 45 years' worth of
radioactive contamination, a job the Energy Department says could
cost $110 billion.
   If the Manahattan Project, which produced atomic bombs at the end
of World War II, was an example of what the United States can do
when it focuses its technological genius, then the current mess in
nuclear weapons production may epitomize what can happen when such
activities are shrouded for decades in secrecy and bureaucracy.
   ``This crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period, and
it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance, safety and
operating conditions,'' 31 members of the House Armed Services
Committee said in a letter Thursday to Energy Secretary John S.
Herrington.
   The National Academy of Sciences, in a report requested by
Congress, described the complex last year as ``a loose-knit system
of largely self-regulated contractors'' under little control of the
Energy Department.
   The complex, comprising many potentially dangerous elements,
operated under a regime dictated not by safety concerns but by the
need to produce nuclear weapons for the arms race, the academy said.
   Not only were the reactors and other facilities older than those
in the civilian sector, the report said, but they were free of the
strict controls imposed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on
utilities after the near-disaster at Three Mile Island on March 28,
1979.
   The Energy Department is the latest in a line of civilian
agencies that have built and managed the plants that turn out an
estimated 1,800 nuclear weapons a year for the Pentagon under a $7.8
billion budget.
   The complex, which now employs about 90,000 people in 13 states _
at three laboratories, two test sites, two reactor complexes and 13
other sites _ was born in 1943 in the desert at Los Alamos, N.M.,
where Manhattan Project scientists labored in remote secrecy.
   Two other weapons laboratories were added, at Livermore, Calif.,
and Sandia, N.M., and the government began operating two reactor
complexes, the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, near Richland, Wash., in
1944, and the Savannah River Plant, in Aiken, S.C., a decade later.
   Other materials are produced at the Feed Materials Production
Center, in Fernald, Ohio; the Ashtabula Plant, Ashtubula, Ohio; the
Y-12 plant and Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant at Oak Ridge,
Tenn.; the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho Falls,
Idaho; the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, in Paducah, Ky.; and the
Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio.
   At the next step, the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver processes
plutonium and assembles primary devices; the Y-12 plant manufactures
second-stage components; the Mound Facility in Miamisburg, Ohio,
makes detonators and firing circuit components; the Kansas City
Plant, in Kansas City, Mo., makes non-nuclear parts; and the
Pinellas Plant, in St. Petersburg, Fla., makes neutron generators,
according to ``The Nuclear Weapons Databook,'' written by Tom B.
Cochran of the National Resources Defense Council.
   All the components are shipped to the Pantex Plant, near
Amarillo, Texas, assembled into warheads and given to the Defense
Department, according to the NRDC, a private environmental group in
Washington.
   Nuclear devices are tested underground at two sites in Nye
County, Nevada, the Nevada Test Range and the Tonopah Test Range.
   Congress has ordered that the Energy Department review all the
sites and produce a report by mid-December on which to modernize and
which, if any, to close, said department spokesman Will Callicott.
   Energy Department plans do not call for the construction of a new
generation of nuclear weapons reactors until well into the next
decade, a $3.2 billion facility at Savannah River and a $3.6 billion
facility in Idaho. Budget austerity could cause further delays or
cancellation of one site.
   The public and Congress began to complain of serious problems in
the nuclear weapons production complex years ago. Although most
attention has focused on problems at Hanford, Savannah River,
Fernald and Rocky Flats, an Energy Department report issued in June
cited problems at nearly every facility and said remedying them
would cost $66 billion to $110 billion.
   The biggest expense will be at the Hanford Reservation, where all
nine reactors have been closed down. In January 1987, engineers
placed the last of them, the N-Reactor, in ``cold standby,'' 25
years after it entered operation.
   The Energy Department, in 19,000 pages of documents released in
February 1986, detailed significant spills of radioactive material
over 43 years, particularly during the Cold War years, when secrecy
was the by-word and the health hazards of radiation were not as well
understood as they are today.
   The cost of upgrading and decontaminating the Hanford Reservation
was forecast by the Energy Department at $2.4 billion through 1995,
with further corrective actions forecast as high as $46 billion over
50 years.
   Department officials have estimated that it could take 18 months
to restart N-reactor, if it were needed.
   The other reactor complex, Savannah River, faces problems that
are almost as serious. All three reactors there have been shut down,
none will be allowed to run at above 50 percent power in the future,
and a select team of engineers is trying to design new safety
procedures for a month-long ``phased start-up'' of one reactor,
starting no earlier than December.
   The cost of correcting problems at Savannah River and cleaning up
contamination is expected to run to $3.6 billion through 1985 and as
high as $8.8 billion thereafter.

   Another alarming situation exists at Fernald, about 20 miles from
Cincinnati. Workers struck the plant nearly a month ago,
interrupting production.
   The state of Ohio, on behalf of the 14,000 people living near the
plant, has filed a $300 million lawsuit against the federal
contractor there, National Lead, based on admissions by the Energy
Department in January 1985 that the facility spewed at least 200,000
pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into the air. The
department also said the plant leaked radioactive waste into the
ground, possibly endangering the Great Miami River aquifer, which
supplies water for communities throughout southwestern Ohio.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste earlier this month demanded that the
Energy Department close down the plant, but thought better of the
idea last Monday and asked the feds to stick around to clean up the
mess.
   ``I shudder to think what would happen if the Department of
Defense washed its hands of this facility,'' said Celeste. ``We know
that a clean-up can be accomplished, and the people best to do it
are the people who work here.''
   The cleanup and corrective costs at Fernald have been estimated
by the Energy Department at $1.1 billion through 1995 and $1.2
billion thereafter.
   Lesser problems have been reported at two nearby plants, in
Dayton and Portsmouth, and the department envisioned no clean-up
costs for the remaining Ohio plant, at Ashtabula.
   Meanwhile, problems at the Rocky Flats Plant are snowballing.
Building 771, where plutonium is reprocessed, was closed down after
two workers suffered low-grade contamination Sept. 29.
   Pat Echart, a spokesman for contractor Rockwell International,
said the 6,000 employees at the plant have continued working at
other buildings on the site. Among their jobs _ processing plutonium
for nuclear triggers.
   Last August, it was disclosed that Energy Department officials
had considered shutting down Rocky Flats because of repeated safety
violations and ``lax attitudes,'' charges that were repeated in a
congressional study released earlier this month.
   Safety complaints at the plant jumped six-fold from 1982 to 1987,
officials of the United Steel Workers Local 8031 announced in March
1987.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, reported last
June that 103 waste-disposal sites needed to be cleaned up. The
Energy Department has estimated the cost of cleanup and correction
there at $576 million to $900 million through 1995, plus $185
million subsequently.
   At other facilities:
   _The Pinellas Plant on central Florida's Gulf Coast grabbed
national headlines in 1983 when the House Energy Committee reported
that its security system failed in a series of mock attacks.
   Security has been tightened there, but investigators have
reported that radioactive and toxic wastes from the 100-acre site
had seeped into Boca Ciega Bay, a popular residential and
recreational area. The cost of cleaning and correcting the seepage,
and coping with other waste problems is forecast to cost $42.4
million through 1995, and up to $9 million thereafter.
   _Environmental improvement at the Oak Ridge site in Tennessee is
expected to cost $1.3 billion through 1995, with much of the money
going to locating buried nuclear waste and cleaning up sediment
ponds. Four research reactors at Oak Ridge have been closed down.
   _Early atomic weapons tests at the Nevada test site were
conducted above ground. Residents of nearby southern Utah contend
the tests caused increased incidences of cancer in their communities
and among veterans who watched the explosions. Tests are conducted
below-ground now, although there have been reports of venting, in
which radioactive material escaped to the surface.
   Environmental costs at the test sites are estimated at $634
million through 1995, and up to $750 million thereafter.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Beetlejuice,'' ``Bright Lights, Big
City,'' ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of the Spring.''
   
   ``Beetlejuice'' (Warner Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated PG)
   
   If a newly-deceased yuppie couple finds their Laura Ashley-esque
New England home occupied by a new family with decorating taste so
bad it could awaken the dead, who ya gonna call?
   ``Beetlejuice!''
   And not a bad call at that, with a hilarious Michael Keaton
starring in the title role of this wacky film which pokes fun at
life and death in the 1980s, and leaves you puzzled whether there's
any important difference between those two states.
   ``Beetlejuice'' opens with Adam and Barbara Maitland perishing
when they drive their standard-issue yuppie Volvo stationwagon off a
wooden bridge. Upon dying, the first thing they learn is that the
crucial difference between life and death is that ghosts seem to
assume pastel tones and dress more flamboyantly.
   They then learn that they are to spend the next 125 years
haunting the home they so lovingly decorated. That sounds OK at
first. But that fate turns hellish when an upscale Manhattan couple
named Deetz and their death-obsessed daughter move in and threaten
the decor with the most tacky taste imaginable.
   The rest of the film describes how the Maitlands, played in
low-key fashion by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, fail miserably in
their efforts to scare the Deetzes out, and finally enlist the help
of the oversexed, supersleezy poltergeist Beetlejuice.
   For all its zaniness, the film isn't as funny as the plot
suggests, especially in the long, dry spells when Keaton isn't on
screen.
   But see ``Beetlejuice'' for three reasons: Catherine O'Hara (of
SCTV fame), who plays Mrs. Deetz to tacky perfection, film great
Sylvia Sidney who has a terrific cameo as the Maitland's guidance
counselor from ``the other side'' and above all, Keaton.
   ``Beetlejuice'' is rated PG, for mildly racy language.

   ``Bright Lights, Big City'' (MGM-UA Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95;
Rated R)
   Poor Jamie Conway. His mother died, his gorgeous model wife left
him, he can't seem to get his fiction writing moving and he's
obviously about to lose his job as a fact-checker for a prestigious
magazine.
   To soothe his pain, Jamie (Michael J. Fox) dives into a huge vat
of self-pity and into the cocaine haze of the Manhattan nights in
``Bright Lights, Big City.''
   While there are some great details in the movie version of Jay
McInerney's hit novel, ``Bright Lights'' is not very engaging on
screen. The book entertains mostly through a running narrative which
falls short in James Bridges' movie, for which McInerney also gets
screenwriting credit.
   Among the winning moments are those on the subway; in a nightclub
where the bartender is a pretty, bald woman and the bathrooms are
co-ed drug dens; and a tender, loving conversation between Jamie and
his mother (Dianne Wiest).
   The actors perform well, including Wiest, who makes you feel her
pain as she dies of cancer; Jason Robards as an alcoholic has-been
editor; Swoozie Kurtz as a co-worker who never gives up on Jamie;
and Keifer Sutherland as Jamie's crass best pal.
   The talented cast also includes Frances Sternhagen, Tracy Pollan
and Phoebe Cates, who has precious little to do but look precious as
Jamie's model-wife.

   ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of the Spring'' (Orion Home
Video; VHS-Beta, $89.98; Rated PG; in French, subtitled)
   
   The Claude Berri films ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of the
Spring'' are halves of a movie in which a good man is undone by
jealous enemies and is avenged by his daughter in the haunted light
and flinty hills of Provence, France.
   Set in the 1920s, ``Jean de Florette'' concerns the young farmer,
Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil), who wants to grow carnations and covets a
plot of land with a secret spring. With his scheming uncle, Papet
(Yves Montand), he caps the spring to buy the land at a bargain
price.
   He is thwarted by Jean (Gerard Depardieu), a hunchback with
Romantic ideals, who inherits the farm and returns to nature with
his wife, Aimee, and young daughter, Manon.
   Ugolin and Papet turn the townspeople against Jean, who remains
ignorant of the spring. His attempts to farm end in disaster. Only
Manon in the last scene learns of the treachery.
   It is 10 years later in ``Manon of the Spring,'' and Manon
(Emanuelle Beart) is a wild young shepherdess in the hills who
avenges her father. By the final scene all the raveled threads of
the plot are rewoven.
   Berri and Gerard Brach's adaptation of Maurice Pangnol's ``L'eau
des Colines'' evokes the pessimism of Guy de Maupassant in its
twisted plot. The movie's beauty and atmosphere survive translation
to the small screen. So do the sloppy subtitles. Montand and
Depardieu (``The Return of Martin Guerre'' and ``Danton'') are both
excellent, Auteuil superb.
   And yet, with all these nice things happening, the thematic
richness of water and secret springs, soil and seasons, these two
half-movies never quite fuse. Ultimately they don't run nearly as
deep as the spring.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. has broken off buyout talks with
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., raising the possibility that the
powerful investment firm might launch a hostile $20.3 billion tender
offer for the food and tobacco conglomerate.
   The failure of the talks appeared to set the stage for a showdown
between Kohlberg Kravis and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Nabisco's
financial partner, over what would be the nation's biggest corporate
acquisition.
   After a meeting of Nabisco's outside directors Wednesday,
President F. Ross Johnson said the group concluded Kohlberg Kravis's
proposal to acquire Nabisco for $90 a share was not in the company's

   Fear will vie with greed in the minds of
traders tempted to illegally use non-public information, according
to the sponsor of the first insider-trading bill to emerge from
Congress since a wave of scandal hit Wall Street two years ago.
   ``Greed and fear are competing emotions, but until now there has
not been a proper balance between the two,'' Rep. Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., said Wednesday.
   The bill passed the House 410-0 last month and by a voice vote in

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says
the fund insuring savings and loan deposits needs more money, but
requiring the Fed to help bail it out could set a dangerous
precedent.
   Greenspan's remarks were made Wednesday in response to questions
submitted by the Senate Banking Committee, which has debated whether
taxpayers must pay to bail out the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates
S&Ls and oversees the insurance fund, believes the assessment levied
on the industry can cover the costs.
   But many analysts, and now Greenspan, agree that the insurance
fund's current revenue flow isn't enough.

   The U.S. economy expanded at a modest 2.2
percent annual rate during the summer, the slowest pace in almost
two years, as the drought and a worsening trade deficit slowed
economic activity.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday the performance of the
gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health,
slowed sharply from July through September after growing at an
annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first six months of the year.
   The Reagan administration blamed much of the sluggishness on
temporary factors such as the drought.

<TEXT>
   News that the economy expanded during the summer at the slowest
pace in nearly two years has driven the dollar to its lowest point
since late June.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday taht the gross national
product, the broadest measure of the economy, grew at a modest 2.2
percent annual rate in the third quarter. Financial market forecasts
widely expected a 3 percent to 3.5 percent rise.
   Slower growth reduces the chance that the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates to cool off inflation, and lower U.S. rates
would reduce demand for dollars.
   The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 125.71 Japanese
yen, down from 126.80 yen late Tuesday.
   By contrast, the bond market, which usually rallies at signs of
slower growth, rose only modestly. The yield on the Treasury's
closely watched 30-year bond slipped to 8.90 percent from 8.93
percent late Tuesday.
   In other economic developments Wednesday:
   _The Labor Department reported that family earnings increased a
median $23 a week or 4 percent _ slightly less than the consumer
price inflation rate of 4.2 percent _ in the past 12 months.
   _The Census Bureau said nearly $19 billion changes hands in the
United States yearly as family members help one another such as
children aiding aging parents or mom and dad helping offspring start
a household.
   _The government said first-year base wage increases _ excluding
cost-of-living adjustments _ averaged 3.3 percent in major union
contracts negotiated in the first nine months of this year.
   The Reagan administration, hoping a buoyant economy will propel
George Bush into the White House, played down the significance of
the new GNP report, blaming much of the sluggishness on temporary
factors such as the drought.
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner predicted economic growth
would pick up again in the final three months of the year,
reflecting further improvement on the trade front and continued
consumer and business spending.
   Private economists generally agreed with that assessment, saying
the slowdown was a welcome development because it should help to
ease inflationary pressures that had been building because of tight
labor markets and high factory operating rates.
   A price index tied to the GNP indicated inflation moderated in
the third quarter. The index, which reflects changing consumption
patterns, rose at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, down from a 5.5
percent rate of increase from April through June.
   The Reagan administration has been forecasting the overall
economy would expand at a 3.5 percent annual rate in 1988, giving
the country the best performance since 1984, also a presidential
election year. GNP grew 3.4 percent last year.

   In the absence of any market-moving developments,
crude oil futures prices have been mixed in dull, quiet trading.
   ``The market is just waiting for the next rumor to come out of
OPEC,'' said Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was scheduled
to meet several times this month to discuss controlling production
as a way to prop up worldwide oil prices, which have fallen sharply
in recent weeks.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 15 cents
Wednesday to settle at $13.41 a barrel, after rising 9 cents on
Tuesday. Other contract months also were higher.
   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline closed at 51.67 cents a
gallon, down 0.27 cent. The contract had risen 1.98 cents on
Tuesday. The November contract for home heating oil, which rose 0.46
cent in the previous session, closed up 1.19 cents at 41.55 cents a
gallon.
   Analysts said the market had little reaction to a report
Wednesday from the Islamic Republic news agency that Iran would
continue to oppose an OPEC production quota for Iraq, its 8-year war
foe, equal to its own.
   Iraq said recently it would maintain its production at a minimum
2.7 million barrels per day, nearly double its assigned OPEC quota.
Iran, meanwhile, is pushing its daily production toward 3 million
barrels, well above its 2.3 million barrel quota.

<HEAD>New CEO Frank Zarb Says Smith Barney Can Succeed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA STOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who soon will take the helm of
beleaguered brokerage Smith Barney Inc. says the firm can succeed in
the hotly competitive investment business by serving specific
markets instead of the masses.
   ``Smith Barney is a really sound organization. It has been around
for 114 years,'' Frank G. Zarb said in a recent interview. ``There
is room in this business for a high-quality firm that is in selected
areas and is not trying to be all things to all people.''
   Zarb, 53, a prominent Wall Street figure who served as energy
czar under President Gerald Ford, will be working for old-time
acquaintance Sanford I. Weill effective Nov. 1, as chairman and
chief executive of Smith Barney.
   Weill is chairman of Commercial Credit Group Inc., which is
acquiring Smith Barney's parent Primerica Corp. Weill, 55, will be
chairman, president and chief executive officer of the merged
company, while Gerald Tsai Jr., chairman of Primerica, will be a
director and chairman of the executive committee.
   Weill created the brokerage firm that now is Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. and Zarb worked in various capacities at its predecessor
firms. In addition to serving as President Ford's chief energy
administrator, Zarb currently is an adviser to Congress and several
foreign governments.
   Smith Barney, a mid-size investment bank specializing in retail
brokerage and municipal finance, disbanded its arbitrage department
_ which essentially speculated on takeover stocks _ after losing $43
million in last year's stock market crash. Smith Barney posted a $15
million profit in the first quarter of this year and a $3 million
loss in the second quarter.
   Analysts say Zarb has his work cut out for him.
   Greenwich-based Primerica acquired Smith Barney last year for
$750 million, loading itself up with new debt just months before the
stock market crash, and subsequent slowdown in the securities
business.
   The success of Smith Barney is regarded as a swing factor for the
profit of the entire corporation.
   ``The key to success there is to control the operating expenses
and try to generate additional revenues from high margin
businesses,'' said David Hochstim, equity analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton in San Francisco.
   Hochstim said Smith Barney needs a strong merger and acqusitions
department to boost its earnings.
   ``That's not something that is easily built overnight,'' he said
in a telephone interview from his San Francisco office.``They have a
good retail sales force, a good equity research department, but they
are not a real force in M&A (mergers and acqusitions) or investment
banking and that's where the money is being made.''
   But he also said the announcement of the merger between Primerica
and Commercial Credit already had benefited Smith Barney.
   ``One of the key points is that since the announced merger,
morale at Smith Barney has improved dramatically and that's worth a
lot,'' he said. ``You no longer have people worrying about their
jobs and future. They're back to work.''
   Other analysts say Smith Barney needs to be a full-service firm _
right now, it doesn't offer a full line of financial products _ but
Zarb disagrees.
   ``Full service implies a large warehouse that does everything for
everyone, whether they do it well or not,'' Zarb said. ``That's not
what we're going to do.
   ``I want to build on what has been a very old and fine reputation
and built it into a firm in the 1990s that will be an important
participant in the upper ends of the marketplace,'' he said.
   Weill and Tsai say Zarb's record and leadership qualities are
what Smith Barney needs.
   ``Frank has two characteristics that I think are key,'' Weill
said in an interview earlier this week. ``Number one, he is a leader
and I think a leader is a person who knows how to listen and get the
most out of people and move something from point a to point b.
   ``Number two, Frank is a winner. He started in Shearson's back
office...and take that through his success in government. He was
assistant secretary of labor and left as energy czar on the
President's Federal Energy Administration,'' Weill said.
   ``I'm convinced he will bring in new talent and motivate the
current management team,'' Tsai said in an interview Wednesday.
``It's a difficult market and if everybody is having a tough time
and you have a new breath of fresh air...I think he will do a lot.''

   Corporate takeovers financed with debt produce
short-term profits on Wall Street but handicap U.S. manufacturers as
they battle foreign competitors, the chairman of steelmaker USX
Corp. says.
   ``It's absolutely critical that we strengthen our manufacturing
sector,'' David Roderick said Wednesday.
   In leveraged buyouts, where the target's assets and future
earnings are often pledged as collateral for loans, ``you load those
companies with debt,'' the head of the steel and oil company said.
   ``That means...you have to cut all spending in order to service
the debt. You cut the research. You cut the capital spending,'' he
said at USX management's quarterly news conference.
   ``Is it desirable in a competitive world, where we are fighting
for our manufacturing lives? The answer is no. It's going to make us
progressively less competitive in those sectors that are being taken
over with the use of debt.''
   Even in light of the recent takeover frenzy, involving
multibillion dollar battles for such huge manufacturers as RJR
Nabisco Inc. and Kraft Inc., Roderick does not favor regulating
corporate takeovers, even though he believes they reflect
shortsightedness.
   USX itself could be a takeover target. Roderick said the stock
market has undervalued the company's stock, which closed at $28 a
share, down 50 cents on Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn, who has held an 11.4 percent
stake in USX since 1986, seems content with his investment and has
not renewed his threat to make an offer for the company, Roderick
said.
   The USX chairman, who dines occasionally with Icahn, said Icahn's
apparent reluctance to make a run at the company is not the result
of any personal courtesy to Roderick, who will retire next spring.
   ``I would assume that Mr. Icahn will ultimately do what he thinks
is good for Mr. Icahn,'' Roderick said.
   ``I remember Carl told me at one point...if you want a friend on
Wall Street, you buy a dog.''
   The shift in the U.S. economy from manufacturing to service
industries should not be allowed to go too far, Roderick said.
   ``You can't...have manufacturing disappear. How do you defend the
country and lead the world in free-world defense by knowing how to
make hamburgers?'' he said.
   ``Ninety-two percent of the non-medical research done in this
country is done by manufacturing,'' Roderick said. ``You don't have
to research a lot if you're talking about travelers checks or
barbers.''

   Pending sales of two government-owned
copper mines could bring debt-ridden Mexico $2 billion, a government
spokesman says.
   The winning bidders for Mexicana de Cobre and Compania Minera de
Cananea will be announced next Tuesday, the government said
Wednesday. Bidding on the two mines in northern Sonora state closed
today.
   The announcement ended speculation that the government had
changed its mind on the controversial sale.
   Jose Romero Contente, of the government development bank Nacional
Financiera, said he expects Mexicana de Cobre will be sold for at
least $1.1 billion while not less than $910 million will be accepted
for Compania Minera de Cananea, Mexico's most historic mine.
   The two companies have debts totaling about $2 billion, Romero
Contente said, but are considered good investments mainly because of
the price of copper is rising in world markets.
   Under a plan to reduce government subsidies and help Mexico
overcome its economic crisis, President Miguel de la Madrid has sold
many government-owned companies, most of them money losers, to
private investors. Most of Mexico's $104 billion foreign debt is
owed by the government.
   Romero Contente said the mine sales would be the crowning
achievement in de la Madrid's re-privatization plan.
   ``Either one of those is the biggest sale by any government in
Latin America in history,'' Romero Contente said by telephone
Wednesday from Mexico City.
   ``They signify an important part of de la Madrid's pledge to
reduce the size of the public sector,'' said Romero Contente,
coordinator of the mine sales for Nacional Financiera, or Nafinsa.
   But the sale has met opposition in Cananea, 25 miles south of the
Arizona border, where the ``martyrs of 1906'' have not been
forgotten.
   A bloody strike at what was then the American-owned Cananea
Consolidated Copper Co. 82 years ago has come to symbolize the birth
of Mexico's nationalistic spirit and union movement.
   At least 11 men died in the strike, launched by Mexican miners
who got paid less than American workers at the mine.
   Joaquin Quijano Salazar, general secretary of the powerful
National Miners Union Section 65 that represents the 3,000 unionized
workers at Cananea, said in a recent interview that the union would
oppose the sale.
   ``They can sell a company, but they can't sell workers,'' Quijano
said in a telephone interview last month. ``We hope they don't find
someone to sell it to.''
   Calls to Quijano's office at the mine did not go through
Wednesday.
   Romero Contente said Nafinsa has had ``no problem with the union.
It knows the federal government's policy.''
   Two companies have bid on Cananea, Penoles and Protexa, which is
based in this northern Nuevo Leon state capital.
   Protexa's $910 million finanincing package was rejected this
summer by Nafinsa, which led to speculation that the mine would not
be sold during the current administration that ends Dec. 1.
   Romero Contente said four companies have put deposits of nearly
$11,000 for the right to bid Thursday on Mexicana de Cobre.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges Over Slow U.S. Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped sharply today in Tokyo,
apparently reflecting disappointment over the slow growth of the
American economy, while share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar's decline followed the release of the latest gross
national product figure, showed the U.S. economy grew at an annual
rate of 2.2 percent during the third quarter of the year compared to
3 percent and 3.4 percent growth in the first two quarters.
   The dollar closed at 125.90 yen, down 0.90 yen from Wednesday's
close of 126.80 yen. The currency opened sharply lower at 125.95 yen
and declined further, ranging between 125.80 yen and 126.15 yen.
   To keep the dollar from declining further, Bank of Japan
intervened and bought dollars shortly after the market opened,
according to Takamasa Yamasaki of the Daiwa Bank.
   Bank of Japan's governor Satoshi Sumita declined comment on the
bank's intervention. The central bank of Japan rarely comments on
its actions.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, share prices gained
102.31 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 27,722.92. The index
gained 106.00 points shortly after the market opened and kept most
of that.
   On Wednesday, it closed at 27,620.60 points.
   The lower-than-expected U.S. GNP figure helped end investors'
concerns over inflation and spurred their buying interest today,
said an analyst with a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   Trading was hectic with volume on the first section estimated at
2 billion shares. Among the issues attracting investors were steels
and shipbuilding.

   The dollar was mixed in Europe today after falling
to four-month lows on a report of unexpectedly low U.S. economic
growth. Gold also was mixed.
   The U.S. currency fluctuated in a narrow range in moderately
active trading. Dealers in Frankfurt and Tokyo reported modest
intervention by the West German and Japanese central bank in support
of the dollar. The banks, as is their custom, declined to comment.
   Dealers said U.S. economic performance was keeping the dollar
low, but market fears of central bank intervention were preventing
it falling further.
   ``The dollar is falling and it has to fall. The only question
mark is the central bank intervention policy,'' said an Italian
trader.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.90 yen to a closing 125.90 yen. Later, in London,
it slipped back even further to 125.70 yen.
   It was the lowest dollar-yen rate recorded in Tokyo since June
17, when the dollar closed at 125.73 yen.
   The dollar's latest decline was triggered by U.S. gross national
product figures which showed the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate
of 2.2 percent during the third quarter of the year compared with 3
percent and 3.4 percent growth in the first two quarters.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.7750 West German marks, up from 1.7745; 1.4975
Swiss francs, down from 1.5065; 6.0635 French francs, down from
6.0725; 2.0035 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0005; 1,322.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,323.50; and 1.1990 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1988.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7580, compared with
$1.7600 Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $408.10 a troy ounce, up
from $407.05 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $407.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $406.95, down from $407.10 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 54 cents to close at a bid
$409.22.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.22 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $6.21.

<TEXT>
   The management of Wickes Cos. Inc.,
who failed in their own bid to buy the company, have approved the
sale of the retail and manufacturing conglomerate to two New York
investment groups for $2.7 billion.
   The agreement by Blackstone Capital Partners and Wasserstein,
Perella Partners to buy Wickes followed by 12 days the termination
of the management-led effort to put the company under private
ownership.
   Wickes' announcement Wednesday suggested the agreement would
result in the departure of chairman Sanford Sigoloff, who brought
the company out of bankruptcy in 1985 and organized the failed
management buyout.
   The agreement calls for Blackstone and Wasserstein Perella to pay
$11.25 a share in cash for 80 percent of Wickes' 49.8 million
shares. The remaining stock would be converted to preferred stock in
WCI Holdings Corp., the company formed to handle the purchase.
   The buyers would also assume Wickes debt, bringing the total
value of the deal to $2.7 billion.
   Wickes stock closed at $9.37{ a share on the New York Stock
Exchange Wednesday, up $1.50 from Tuesday's close.
   The management offer of $12 per share was withdrawn after Wickes
lowered its 1988 earnings forecast by $40 million.
   Analysts said it appeared the Blackstone-Wasserstein Perella
agreement would end speculation about potential buyers and the
possibility the company could be broken up and some pieces sold.
   ``These are reputable people and it looks like a real deal,''
said Anthony Pearce-Batten, who tracks Wickes for the investment
firm Legg Mason, Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore.
   Lloyd Kanev of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York said
his firm was advising clients to sell their shares as it appeared
higher bids were unlikely.
   Officers of Blackstone and Wasserstein Perella would become
co-chairmen of Wickes, according to a company release, which did not
address Sigoloff's future.
   Wickes spokesman Michael Sitrick refused to discuss Sigoloff's
status and said the executive was declining interviews.
   Blackstone and Wasserstein Perella would have equal say in
directing the company, which operates furniture stores and the
Builders Emporium home improvement stores in Southern California and
has groups that make automotive fabrics, wallpaper and aircraft
parts.
   Co-chairmen will be James R. Birle, 52, a Blackstone partner and
former vice president of General Electric Co., and Robert B. McKeon,
34, a managing director of Wasserstein Perella, the companies
announced.
   Management had been trying to sell the company since the August
management buyout offer, which was designed to draw higher bids.
   Wasserstein, Perella is part of Wasserstein, Perella & Co., the
merger and acquisition specialists.

<HEAD>Great Western Fed Up With Federal Thrift Regulators; Wants Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Western Bank, the nation's
third largest savings and loan, says it wants to leave the troubled
federal system that bails out failed thrifts and to join the
insurance system for commercial banks.
   The move would save Great Western at least $27 million a year in
insurance premiums and send a message to Congress that the nation's
healthy thrifts are fed up with paying to rescue faltering, often
badly managed S&Ls, analysts said.
   ``This is a very important statement,'' said Peter Treadway, an
analyst for the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New
York. ``This is a signal that Great Western is not going to put up
with any more nonsense and have its net worth stolen without a
fight.''
   Great Western said Wednesday it has applied for permission to
drop Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. coverage of deposits
in its 263 retail branches in California, Florida and Arizona in
favor of insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
covers most banks and some thrifts.
   At least one other big California thrift, San Diego-based Home
Federal Savings & Loan Association, was considering pulling out of
the FSLIC, but was prevented from doing so immediately by its
charter.
   Most savings institutions are barred by Congress from leaving the
FSLIC, although Great Western says it is exempt from that rule.
   Great Western's action appeared unlikely to mark the beginning of
a mass exodus from the FSLIC, which faces $50 billion to $100
billion in bailout costs. But the move was seen to have great
symbolic significance as members of Congress are expected this
session to put a high priority on the issue of thrift bailouts.
   ``This is sure to get the attention of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board and Congress,'' said Norman Coulson, chief executive of
Glendale Federal Savings & Loan Association. ``Congress has got to
address this problem sooner or later. They can't continue tapping
the healthy thrifts forever.''
   James Montgomery, chairman of parent Great Western Financial
Corp., said the application was made to protect the firm's
stockholders from special insurance levies.
   The insurance switch, if approved, wouldn't affect customers or
employees, but would save the parent company and its stockholders
about $26 million a year in special FSLIC premiums, said spokesman
Ian Campbell.
   Great Western is among about 40 of the nation's 3,200 S&Ls that
filed documents making them eligible for exemptions from the ban on
defections from the FSLIC that was imposed by Congress in August
1987 and renewed Aug. 10.
   About 10 S&L's, none of them as large as Great Western, have left
the FSLIC to be insured by the FDIC while retaining their savings
and loan charters.
   What irks healthy thrifts are the high FSLIC premiums they are
charged to offset the losses of a minority troubled thrifts. Those
premiums run about 2{ times more than those assessed by the FDIC.
   Both the FSLIC and the FDIC insure customers accounts up to
$100,000. But while the thirft insurer is insolvent, the FDIC
expects to have at least $15 billion in reserves by the end of the
year.
   Great Western Financial, based in Beverly Hills, is the nation's
No. 3 thrift holding company with $31 billion in assets and 900
offices nationwide. It focuses its business in industry's
traditional area of home mortgages, as opposed to aggressive and
sometimes shaky thrifts that have made commercial loans.
   Great Western said it would accomplish the insurance switch by
merging its California, Florida and Arizona retail operations into a
small thrift subsidiary in Washington state that already has FDIC
insurance.
   In California, defections from the FSLIC are hampered by state
thrift laws, which don't allow state-chartered S&Ls to carry FDIC
insurance.

<HEAD>West Point Puts Severance Plan In Place To Protect Employees In
Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textile giant West Point-Pepperell Inc., facing a
takeover fight with Farley Inc., has created a financial cushion for
more than 14 percent of its employees who might find themselves
without a job under a new owner.
   However, Pepperell said Tuesday, the severance pay package has
nothing to do with the $1.4 billion tender offer announced Monday by
Farley, one of the nation's largest privately held conglomerates.
   D. Michael Roark, Pepperell's vice president of human resources,
said the severance plan was adopted by the board last week.
   ``This is not something we did in response to Bill Farley,''
Roark said. William Farley heads the conglomerate which owns
underwear manufacturer Fruit of the Loom and other companies.
   ``We had been talking (about the plan) in the management group
for several months,'' Roark said in a telephone interview from the
company's Pepperell, Ga., headquarters.
   ``This was not, and we don't now consider it, `shark
repellent,''' he said, referring to jargon used to describe tactics
companies use to fend off corporate raiders.
   A Farley spokesman said the company would have no comment on the
provision.
   Roark said the plan _ which guarantees at least three months pay
to some 5,900 salaried and clerical employees _ would not involve
enough money to dissuade a suitor. However, he had no estimate on
the amount of money involved, saying it would depend on how many
employees were involved and their level of seniority.
   The decision fits in with a series of moves Pepperell has taken
this year to strengthen its ability to fight a takeover.
   In June, the company adopted a shareholder rights plan which
would allow the board to issue a special class of stock as a
dividend to current stockholders. The ``poison pill'' plan would
take effect as soon as a tender offer is launched or if someone
purchases 10 percent of Pepperell stock.
   Farley notified the company in May it was seeking up to 25
percent of Pepperell stock and so far has spent $88 million for 9.8
percent of the stock.
   The company is also one of the first to adopt Georgia's new
anti-takeover law, enacted by the Legislature principally at the
urging of textile industry lobbyists. The main provision of the law,
which took effect in March, limits a new owner's ability to sell off
parts of a company for five years.
   Pepperell also has had in place for some time so-called ``golden
parachutes'' for executives, including a $1.39 million payout to
Chief Executive Officer Joseph L. Lanier Jr. if he were to be fired
by new owners.
   The new state law, and the ``poison pill'' plan have been
challenged by Farley in federal court and a Pepperell stockholder,
who filed a suit in state Superior Court Tuesday, claiming
stockholders are deprived of the highest possible stock price.
   The severance plan covers all salaried and certain skilled
clerical workers.
   Pepperell is the nation's largest publicly held textile and
apparel company. Earlier this year, the company and the investment
group Odyssey Partners Inc. jointly acquired J.P. Stevens & Co. Inc.

   Chrysler Corp. said today its third-quarter
earnings fell 54.3 percent compared with the same period a year ago,
mainly because of heavy costs for incentives and the retooling of a
Delaware assembly plant.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker said it earned $112.5 million, or 50
cents a share, on sales of $7.01 billion during the July-September
period this year. During the three-month period last year, Chrysler
said it earned $246 million, or $1.12 a share, on sales of $6.17
billion.
   In a statement, Chrysler said that in addition to the high costs
of incentives, which the company used extensively to lure buyers
into showrooms, and the closing for the entire period of the Newark,
Del., assembly plant, the company had a heavier proportion of fleet
sales over more profitable individual car sales.
   General Motors Corp. was expected to announce its third-quarter
results today, a day after No. 2 Ford Motor Co. posted a 21.8
percent rise in its third-quarter earnings _ its 10th straight
report of record quarterly profits.
   For the first nine months of this year, Chrysler's earnings fell
34.4 percent to $616.6 million, or $2.77 a share, from $939.5
million, or $4.33 a share, last year. Sales for the first nine
months of 1988 amounted to $23.17 billion, compared with $18.61
billion in 1987, a 24.5 percent increase.
   Also today, Chrysler Financial Corp. reported record
third-quarter earnings of $59 million, 20 percent more than the $49
million it earned during the third quarter of last year. For the
first nine months of 1988, the financial arm of Chrysler Corp.
earned $185 million, a nine-month record and up 12 percent from the
$166 million it earned during the January-September period last year.
   On Wednesday, Ford said it earned $856.3 million, or $1.78 per
share, on sales of $17.73 billion during the July-September period
this year. That compares with earnings of $703.2 million, or $1.38 a
share, on sales of $15.25 billion during the same period last year.
   For the first nine months of the year, Ford earned $4.1 billion,
or $8.53 a share, on sales of $60.9 billion, up 12.2 percent from
earnings of $3.7 billion, or $7.17 a share on sales of $52.9 billion
during the January-September period last year.
   David McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance and treasurer,
said the company continued to do well overseas, especially in Europe
and South America.
   ``We do have a declining (profit) margin in the United States and
that's been the case all year,'' he said. ``The overseas margin has
been increasing because of outstanding results this year in Europe
and also Latin America has come back substantially.''
   Ford said it earned $384 million from its overseas operations in
the third quarter of 1988, up 249 percent from the $110 million
earned overseas during the period last year.
   The company earned $472 million from its U.S. operations, down
20.4 percent from the $593 million it earned in the July-September
period last year.
   Because of the depressed U.S. results, profit sharing for
unionized workers will be down this year compared with last,
McCammon said. Although he wasn't specific about just how much a
worker would receive, he said it would fall somewhere between the
$3,700 average per worker in 1987 and the $2,100 average the year
before.
   McCammon blamed much of the U.S. decline on development of new
products, lower earnings by the company's Financial Services Group
and higher production of lower-profit cars.
   He said that during the quarter, Ford produced 30 percent fewer
of its high-profit Thunderbirds than it did last year, and made more
lower-profit Ford Tempos and Mercury Topazes.

   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. took its $20.3
billion takeover offer directly to RJR Nabisco Inc.'s stockholders
today, after managers of the consumer products giant ended talks
with the investment firm.
   Nabisco's management said it would continue to work with its
investment adviser, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., on its own buyout
proposal.
   In an advertisement appearing in the Wall Street Journal,
Kohlberg Kravis said its offer was conditioned on Nabisco's board
supporting the bid. But corporate America was watching the fight
closely to see how far the firm would go to protect its position as
the nation's premier leveraged buyout firm.
   Since its founding in 1976, Kohlberg Kravis has not acquired a
company without the support of the target's board, although the firm
gradually has become more aggressive in its deal making.
   Kohlberg Kravis had announced Monday that it might begin the
$90-a-share tender offer. That was just four days after Nabisco said
its top managers were considering trying to buy the company for $75
a share, which would be worth $17 billion.
   Nabisco stock edged up 12{ cents a share to $84.87{ in early
trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The sheer size of Kohlberg Kravis's bid for Nabisco has forced
corporations to reassess their own vulnerability.
   ``There's been a gradual awakening over the past week that if
deals above $10 billion are successful, it gives credibility to even
larger deals, and it's getting down to almost a handful of companies
that are secure'' based on sheer size alone, said one top takeover
lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   According to one takeover specialist, who spoke on condition he
not be identified, Kohlberg Kravis is ``attempting to keep bidding
on bigger and bigger deals so other people in leveraged buyout
business can't compete with them. They'd like to be thought of as
... the only ones that come to mind when it's a super-big deal.''
   The stakes are high with Nabisco. Not only are the potential
financial rewards astronomical, but there is the cachet that comes
with succeeding in a deal that carries a gargantuan price tag. And
on a more subtle level are the egos of those who are driven to
establish new benchmarks.
   Supervising the firm's proposal is Henry Kravis, as prominent on
the New York social circuit as he is in the takeover game. He is
widely expected to go the distance to protect his company's lockup
of mega-sized leveraged buyouts.
   Kravis was particularly miffed that Nabisco was working with
Shearson, because he had been interested in the Atlanta-based food
and tobacco conglomerate for some time. Kravis first broached the
subject of leading a Nabisco buyout a year ago over dinner with
Nabisco's Johnson.
   Nabisco's decision to stick with Shearson even after meeting with
Kravis pits him against his one-time skiing partner, Shearson
Chairman Peter Cohen.
   The sometimes abrasive Cohen has let slip in the press his
astonishment that Kravis would be such a tough competitor after
skiing and socializing with him. But those who know them wonder just
how close the pair was.
   ``They are competitors in the same arena. They know one another,
but I don't know if they are good friends. They're both very cool
individuals,'' a takeover specialist said.
   Cohen is benefiting from Shearson's more subtle ties to Nabisco
in addition to having the support of the management team. Nabisco's
Johnson is said to be a close friend of James Robinson, chairman of
American Express Co., Shearson's parent.
   In an earlier era, Kohlberg Kravis worked on the same side of the
fence as Shearson. Within the past year Kohlberg Kravis acquired Jim
Walter Corp. for $2.43 billion as Shearson served as the board's
banker. And Shearson served in the same capacity when Kohlberg
Kravis acquired Stop & Shop Cos. for $1.2 billion.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows Sharply and Unexpectedly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit narrowed
sharply and unexpectedly in September, partly helped by erratic
items such as exports of aircraft repairs and precious stones, the
government said Thursday.
   The pound and British stock prices shot up on the news, which
somewhat eased growing concerns about Britain's ballooning trade
shortfall. The pound's jump, in turn, diminished fears that interest
rates would head even higher.
   The trade deficit narrowed to 1.06 billion pounds, or $1.87
billion, in September from 1.81 billion pounds in August, the
Department of Trade and Industry said.
   The financial markets had expected the deficit to widen slightly.
   The current account deficit narrowed to 560 million pounds from
1.31 billion pounds, the department said.
   The current account includes ``invisible'' trade such as
services, overseas investment earnings and official transfer
payments, which the government estimated to be in surplus of 500
million pounds in the most recent month.
   Exports totaled 7.56 billion pounds in September, up from 6.75
billion pounds in August. Imports totaled 8.62 billion pounds in
September, up from 8.56 billion pounds in August.
   Explaining the erratic items, the department said planes brought
here for repair counted as imports in August and became exports last
month when the work was done.
   Excluding these items, the merchandise trade deficit was 1.49
billion pounds in September, compared with 1.66 billion pounds in
August.
   The pound gained almost 1.5 cents to $1.7735 in very active
dealing minutes after the report was released.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index, off 5.6
points before the report, later was up 8 points at 1,858.7.
   Although markets were heartened by the report, David Simmonds, an
economist at Midland Bank, said it was too early to conclude that
Britain's trade deficit is narrowing significantly. He pointed out
that Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has said the trade
deficit could remain large until 1990.
   The government's economic policies have come under criticism in
recent months as inflation has heated up, prompting authorities to
push up interest rates sharply. At the same time, the trade deficit
outstripped government forecasts to hit record levels.
   Opposition Labor lawmaker Bryan Gould, party spokesman on trade,
called the latest figures ``a freak.''
   Since the beginning of 1988, Britain's merchandise trade balance
has been in deficit by 13.9 billion pounds, compared with a
6.88-billion-pound deficit a year earlier.
   In March, Lawson predicted the trade deficit for the latest year
would total 4 billion pounds.

   Americans' personal income rose 0.5 percent in
September, despite a drop in farm income, while spending growth was
the slowest since the October stock market crash, the government
said today.
   The Commerce Department said income rose $19.9 billion to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.10 trillion last month,
following a weak 0.3 percent increase in August and a strong 0.7
percent jump in July.
   Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except
interest payments on debt, was flat in September at an annual rate
of $3.26 trillion, following a 0.6 percent gain in August and a 0.4
percent increase the month before that.
   It was the weakest month for spending since October 1987, when it
fell 0.2 percent. Analysts had attributed that drop to the shock
from the stock crash.
   The spending data fits in with other statistics showing the
economy growing more slowly at the end of the third quarter. Retail
sales fell in both August and September and overall economic growth
as measured by the gross national product was an anemic 2.2 percent
in the third quarter.
   With spending holding steady and income rising, Americans saved
more in September than in any month since May. The personal savings
rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ was 4.2 percent
last month, up from 3.8 percent in August.
   Personal income was held back by a $6.5 billion decrease in farm
income, an apparent effect of the summer drought, even though
government subsidy payments were unchanged.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, were up
$14.1 billion, or 0.6 percent, in September, led by a 0.8 percent
jump in manufacturing payrolls.
   Disposable, or after-tax, income was up 0.5 percent last month
after a 0.3 percent gain. Personal tax payments in September, one of
four payment months for taxpayers filing quarterly, were up $3.6
billion compared with an increase of $2.0 billion in August.
   Americans purchased $3.1 billion fewer durable goods, ``big
ticket'' items expected to last three or more years. That nearly
offset increases of $400 million in non-durable goods and $3.4
billion in services.

   Wheat futures prices opened slightly higher while
soybeans and corn were mixed in early trading today on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices gained some strength from reports that China may be
targeted for a large wheat purchase, analysts said.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department's plans to take up to 1.5 million
tons of wheat out of a food reserve program also affected trading in
the wheat pit, while expectations that Spain may be in the market
for soybeans added firmness to bean prices, they said.
   Despite some gains, the surge of follow-through buying that had
been anticipated after Wednesday's late rally in grains and beans
did not materialize, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to { cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.12\ a bushel; corn was 1{
cents lower to 1 cent higher, with December at $2.79 a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with December at $2.37 a bushel; and
soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher, with November at

   Live cattle and hog futures prices were mixed while pork belly
prices dipped in early trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle prices opened .5 cent lower to .25 cent higher with

cattle were unchanged to .15 cent higher, with October at 81.57

December at 41.32 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .15

<HEAD>Chairman of MCorp Says Bankruptcy Filing `A High Probability'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of MCorp, a Dallas-based bank holding
company, says there is a high probability the company will file for
reorganization in bankruptcy court or be forced into that action by
creditors.
   ``I think everybody recognizes that there is a high probability
that we will be in (Chapter 11) bankruptcy within 30 days,''
chairman Gene Bishop told the Dallas Times Herald Wednesday. ``It's
obvious that we can be forced and that we may not have any choice.''
   ``In the interest of protecting our assets and our creditors,
it's really the only alternative,'' he said.
   There had been recent speculation that the bank holding company,
Texas' second-largest behind NCNB Texas National Bank, was forcing
the reorganization issue to advance its own plan to recapitalize.
Chapter 11 protection would free the corporation from the threat of
creditor lawsuits until it could develop a plan to put its finances
in order.
   MCorp announced earlier this week it would stop paying dividends
to preferred shareholders and would cease payments on about $470
million in debt. That action effectively put the company's creditors
on notice that they could push MCorp into bankruptcy court after
Nov. 21.
   ``When we made the decision last week to quit paying dividends
and interest (on debt), that gives us 30 days from that date, which
is Nov. 21,'' Bishop said.
   ``It's sometimes very hard to get the government's attention, and
I do think now that we've got their attention,'' Bishop said. ``The
time clock is running now.''
   MCorp proposed a recapitalization package earlier this month that
would include $400 million from the bank holding company itself,
$400 million raised from investors and shareholders, and an
undisclosed amount of aid from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Analysts have estimated the company would need at least $1
billion in federal money.
   MCorp has set aside $400 million for the rescue and the FDIC
wants the company to spread that money around to its ailing banks.
   ``The regulators . . . are saying we should use our money, and
put it down in the banks and then they'll see what they can do for
us,'' Bishop said. ``They will give us no assurance they will do
anything.''
   Bishop said MCorp attorneys have told the company to leave the
money where it is, partly for the recapitalization and partly so the
board won't be sued by creditors upset that the holding company was
putting all of its assets into its subsidiary banks.
   ``What we hope is that we'll be able to use that $400 million
(belonging to the holding company) in connection with the
recapitalization of all of the MCorp banks,'' Bishop said.
   The company could work out its differences with creditors,
preferred shareholders and the FDIC in bankruptcy court, he said.
   MCorp depositors, customers, and suppliers would not be affected
by a reorganization proceeding, a spokesman said.
   ``The deposits would still be insured by the FDIC, and it would
be business as usual,'' the spokesman said.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has dismissed fines totaling $690,000
against John Morrell & Co. for safety problems at its Sioux Falls,
S.D., plant, the company says.
   The fines, recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration in April 1987, were at that time the third-largest in
OSHA's history. They resulted from charges by OSHA that Morrell, the
nation's fifth-largest meatpacker, had willfully failed to record
accidents at the Sioux Falls plant.
   But the company, which is based here, said in a news release
Wednesday that Administrative Law Judge James A. Cronin ruled
against OSHA, saying the statute of limitations governing the
violations had expired.
   The company said the judge he added that even if time had not run
out, he would have reduced the fines should to only $11,000.
   Cronin, a judge with the OSHA Review Commission in Denver, said
the agency was incorrect to fine Morrell $10,000 for each of the 69
safety violations.
   The review commission in the past has said it is fundamentally
unfair to assess multiple penalties for similar violations.
   OSHA representative Terry Mikelson said the agency probably will
appeal Cronin's ruling to a higher review panel. Further appeals
could take the case into the federal court system.
   OSHA is investigating Morrell for repetitive motion injuries
sustained by its workers as well as other alleged physical hazards.
Repetitive motion injuries include tendonitis, various postural
strains and carpal tunnel syndrome, a debilitating nerve disorder.
They occur when workers repeat the same motions over and over.
   Steve Crim, senior vice president at the Sioux Falls plant, said,
``We have always felt the fines were grossly unfair and we would win
our appeal to have them overturned.''
   Morrell chairman Milton Schloss has said he implemented a safety
program that sharply reduced injury rates in the past few months.

<HEAD>Perot Drops Part of Lawsuit Against EDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas billionaire Ross Perot has withdrawn a
request for a temporary order prohibiting Electronic Data Systems
Corp. from interfering with his new data processing company, Perot
Systems.
   With Wednesday's action, Perot dropped part of his countersuit to
a claim filed by EDS, which argued that by founding the new firm,
Perot was violating a non-competition clause in the agreement he
signed when he left EDS.
   In a hearing last week on EDS' suit, a Virginia judge ruled that
Perot Systems does not violate the agreement as long as it is
operated on a non-profit basis until December 1989.
   Fletcher Yarbrough, Perot's attorney, said the ruling negated the
need to seek the preliminary injunction.
   EDS officials called the move a retreat from a ``nonsense''
lawsuit.
   ``Ross has just got to quit being so mad,'' EDS spokesman William
Wright told the Dallas Times Herald. ``There's just so long that you
can carry on a vendetta like that before it becomes detrimental to
business.''
   Perot's attorneys have contended that EDS has tried to put Perot
Systems out of business by interfering with pending contracts,
intimidating prospective clients of Perot Systems and intimidating
EDS employees who might be considering joining Perot.
   The development is the latest in an ongoing legal battle
involving Perot, EDS and General Motors Corp., EDS' parent company.
The dispute centers around several paragraphs of a December 1986
buyout agreement between Perot and GM, in which Perot promised not
to compete for profit with EDS until December 1989.
   EDS had sought to prevent Perot from operating any competing
business until the terms of the contract expired. The full trial is
set for April in Virginia.

54 cents a share, reported for the same period last year.
   First-quarter sales rose to $2.8 billion from last year's $2.4

   Packaged foods, the company's largest business segment, reported
$1.2 billion in sales for the quarter, up 8.3 percent from $1.1

   The Sara Lee Bakery segment of its packaged foods division posted
a 9 percent unit volume gain, enjoying particularly strong sales in
its international and bakery and delicatessan operations, the

   Sara Lee's food-service division reported first-quarter sales of
$653.8 million, up 16 percent from $563.7 million a year earlier.
   First-quarter sales for Sara Lee's packaged consumer products,
including Hanes hosiery, climbed 22.4 percent to $853.5 million from

   Shares prices finished mixed Thursday on the London
Stock Exchange as the government reported better-than-expected
British trade figures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 1.4
points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,852.1.
   But the narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed down 0.6
point at 1,502.6. And the Financial Times 500-share index was up
1.28 at 1,053.48.
   Trading activity was brisk throughout the day, as a total of
581.5 million shares changed hands, compared with the 481.3 million
shares Wednesday.
   Prices rallied after the late-morning release of the British
trade report for September.
   The merchandise trade deficit narrowed to 1.06 billion pounds, or
$1.87 billion, last month from 1.81 billion pounds, or $3.19
billion, in August, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   The financial markets had expected the deficit to widen slightly.
   But later, prices fell back as the Dow Jones industrial average
sank about 30 points lower in the first hour of trading in New York.
   By the close of London trading, the Dow Jones average was off
35.02 points.

<HEAD>Koppers To Divide and Sell Chemical Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British industrialist Brian C. Beazer said
Thursday he plans to split up the chemicals unit of his
Pittsburgh-based Koppers Co. and sell them by January.
   Beazer declined to disclose the total selling price, but
indicated it would be more than the $660 million offered earlier
this year by a management-led group.
   The number of employees at Koppers' Pittsburgh headquarters,
which has dropped from 500 to 280 since Koppers was acquired in
June, will be reduced to 90 after the sale of the chemicals units,
he said.
   Beazer also announced that Koppers' name would be changed to
Beazer Building Materials & Services Inc. once the chemical unit was
sold.
   Koppers manufactures construction materials and chemicals and is
one of the largest U.S. concerns producing road-building materials.
   Beazer told a group of investment bankers in New York that he had
received at least three serious bids for each section of the
chemical division, which has been split along product lines.
   ``We would expect to receive sales proceeds higher than if it had
been sold (as one unit) last June,'' he said. ``At the present time
we are negotiating with seven individual buyers. We consider it in
the best interests of all concerned.''
   Beazer PLC, a Bath, England-based homebuilding and construction
materials company, purchased Koppers in June for $1.8 billion after
a bitter struggle by Koppers management. Beazer's stock will be
listed on the New York Stock Exchange starting Friday.
   The company said its expansion efforts had been strengthened by
the acquisition of Koppers, coming after the 1986 purchase of
Dallas-based Gifford-Hill & Co. Inc., which makes cement and builds
houses in several states.
   Since the purchase of Koppers, Beazer has sold four of its units
for $90 million and is in the process of selling two others for $60
million, Beazer said. He said proceeds from all the asset sales,
including the chemicals unit, would total $900 million.

   The U.S. dollar fell Thursday against most major
currencies in active European trading after hitting four-month lows
on a report of unexpectedly low U.S. economic growth. Gold prices
were higher.
   The dollar came under renewed pressure at midday, partly pushed
down by a report of a narrower-than-expected British trade deficit
in September and continued selling pressure related to Wednesday's
report of a modest rise in the U.S. gross national product.
   ``People are uncertain following the surprisingly good figures
from Britain,'' said a senior dealer at a bank in Frankfurt, West
Germany. ``They were buying (British) pounds and selling dollars.''
   Britain's merchandise deficit narrowed to 1.06 billion pounds
($1.87 billion) in September, partly helped by erratic items such as
exports of aircraft repairs and precious stones, the government said
Thursday.
   The U.S. government said the third-quarter gross national product
rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, the smallest rise in almost
two years.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.90 Japanese yen to a closing 125.90
yen. Later, in London, it slipped back further to 125.75 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7695 from $1.7600 late
Wednesday.
   Dealers said the dollar recovered some ground in late European
trading on buying by Japanese traders. Market fears of central bank
intervention had prevented the dollar from falling further.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.7725 West German marks, down from 1.7745; 1.4915
Swiss francs, down from 1.5065; 6.0455 French francs, down from
6.0725; 1.9977 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0005; 1,320.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,323.50; and 1.2024 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1988.
   Gold bullion edged higher in lethargic trading in Europe.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell 54 cents to close at a bid $409.22 a troy
ounce. In Zurich, it rose to $407.20 bid from $407.10 bid Wednesday.
In London, it rose to $407.50 an ounce from $407.05.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a late bid price of $6.22
a troy ounce, unchanged from Wednesday.

   Wheat futures prices were mixed while corn and
soybeans fell Thursday in trading at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   An announcement from the U.S. Agriculture Department that China
is being offered 550,000 tons of wheat under the export bonus plan
sparked buying in the wheat pit, analysts said.
   But the slide of corn and soybean prices confirmed sentiment that
Wednesday's late rally ``was just a bubble,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Harvest pressure, lack of demand and improved weather in South
America, a major soybean producer, all kept the lid on prices,
Lespinasse said.
   ``The markets are showing their true colors,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat was } cent lower to 4 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.11{ a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 6 cents lower, with December at $2.74{ a bushel; oats were
2 cents to 7} cents lower, with December at $2.32\ a bushel; and
soybeans were 2 cents to 9 cents lower, with November at $7.60 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Construction Contracts to Fall 4 Percent in 1989, Economist Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Embargoed for Release at 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracting for new construction will fall 4
percent next year to a total of $241 billion, an economist said
Thursday.
   Continuing high vacancy rates in offices and apartments, and
rising mortgage interest rates, will bring a decline in both
commercial and residential building, said George A. Christie, vice
president and chief economist of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co.
   In the first nine months of this year, new building contracting
declined about 3 percent from the 1987 level, according to
McGraw-Hill.
   ``The state of the construction industry as we near the close of
1988 is best described as one quarter in decline, another quarter in
limbo, and the remaining half in jeopardy,'' Christie told the
Building Products Executives Conference.
   Contracting is off 40 percent in the overdeveloped commercial
building sector, where high vacancy rates persist, Christie said.
   He said public works construction is in limbo because of the
drive to cut the federal budget deficit.
   Single-family housing and institutional construction are in
jeopardy, Christie noted, since they are sensitive to interest rates.
   ``Rising mortgage and bond rates pose a threat in the near future
to at least half of all construction activity,'' he said.
   Christie predicted that rising interest rates will produce a drop
in single-family housing starts to 900,000 units in 1989 from
975,000 this year.
   The economist forecast that an 18 percent drop in retail
building, to $18.9 billion, will help fuel an anticipated 8 percent
decline next year in commercial construction.

   The stock market posted a broad loss today as
traders showed signs of wariness over the recent wave of corporate
buyout bids.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 24.71 to 2,140.47
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 317 up, 1,185 down
and 430 unchanged.
   Huge bids for companies like RJR Nabisco and Kraft in recent days
have dominated conversations on Wall Street.
   While deals like these bring opportunities for large short-term
profits, analysts said, they have also prompted widespread talk
about the potential dangers of the new debt burdens created to
finance the transactions.
   News reports this morning said investors apparently had balked at
an offering of high-yield Federated Department Stores bonds arising
from Campeau Corp.'s takeover of Federated last spring.
   First Boston Corp., the lead underwriter, said it had not
withdrawn the offering but was engaged in discussions with the
company to ``restructure the transaction.''
   Also, Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board said
Wednesday that the Fed has advised banks to be cautious in their
lending for buyouts.
   RJR Nabisco shares dropped 3[ to 81| and Kraft fell 3] to 94[,
ranking among the most active Big Board issues.
   Sears Roebuck, which has climbed sharply of late on talk of a
possible restructuring or other transaction, lost 1| to 43[.
   Pillsbury, the target of a takeover bid by Grand Metropolitan PLC
of Britain, dropped 2\ to 58}.
   On the plus side, General Motors gained 2] to 80. The company
reported third-quarter earnings of $2.46 a share, against $2.28 in
the like period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.11 to 156.26. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 3.12 at 300.32.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 171.88 million shares with an

<HEAD>City Growth Seems Fastest in Midwest, Accounting Firm Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic growth in the nation's largest cities
appears to be rising fastest in the Midwest, according to a study
released Thursday by the accounting firm Grant Thornton.
   In the past three years, by contrast, economic growth has been
strongest in Eastern cities, New York-based Grant Thornton said.
   The Grant Thornton index showed that, in the second quarter, the
average rate of economic growth for Midwestern cities rose more than
the comparable rates for cities in the East, West and South.
   The index is a quarterly composite of seven economic indicators
collected for 24 major U.S. cities.
   In the second quarter, the firm said, the seven fastest-growing
metropolitan economies were those of Minneapolis, Detroit,
Cincinnati, Kansas City, Mo., St. Louis, Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
   The index for three cities _ Dallas, Phoenix and Los Angeles _
was unchanged in the second quarter from the first, Grant Thornton
said. Three other cities showed an economic decline: Miami, Seattle
and Atlanta.
   The economic indicators used to rank the cities include
commercial and residential construction permits, average weekly
hours worked by manufacturing employees, business starts and
failures, and retail sales.
   After the seven cities with the fastest-growing economies, the
others in descending order of magnitude are Boston, Milwaukee,
Denver, San Diego, Chicago, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Houston,
San Francisco, Philadelphia, New York, Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles,
Atlanta, Seattle and Miami.
   Grant Thornton is a 64-year-old firm that provides accounting,
audit, tax and management consulting services in more than 50
countries.

   Assets of the nation's 453 money market mutual
funds rose $1.73 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $270.52 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $1.21 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 223 general purpose funds rose $296.7 million to $85.63
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds increased $519.9 million
to $114.38 billion, and assets of 128 institutional funds rose
$909.0 million to $70.51 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.54 percent from 7.49 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 7.50 percent from 7.47 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 37 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.07 percent as of Wednesday from 6.05 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.82
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.80 the
previous week. Yields were 8.12 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.11
percent; 8.33 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.32 percent; and 8.56
percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.57 percent.

   General Motors Corp. on Thursday reported an
industry earnings record of $859.2 million for the third quarter,
eclipsing rival Ford Motor Co., while Chrysler Corp. said its
earnings dropped 54.3 percent for the period.
   GM said its quarterly earnings, which work out to $2.46 a share,
came on sales of $25.04 billion. On Wednesday, Ford reported
third-quarter earnings of $856.3 million, or $1.78 a share, on sales
of $17.73 billion.
   It was the first time in five quarters that GM has outearned Ford.
   GM Chairman Roger B. Smith and President Robert Stempel credited
the company's performance to growing North American sales and
continued strength in the foreign markets, especially in Europe.
   GM had originally reported a profit of $812.3 million, or $2.28 a
share, for the third quarter of 1987, but said today that accounting
changes made the comparable figures for last year $421 million, or
$1.05 per share.
   Adjusted sales for the third quarter of last year amounted to
$22.6 billion, the company said.
   For the first nine months of 1988, GM said it earned $3.46
billion, or $10.09 per share, up 27.4 percent from $2.72 billion, or
$7.70 per share, during the January-September period last year.
Sales for the first nine months of this year amounted to $81.38
billion, up 7.9 percent from the $75.4 billion in sales during the
first three quarters of 1987.
   GM's results surprised auto analysts.
   ``The consensus for guys on Wall Street for the third quarter was
a $1.50 (per share),'' said Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York.
   ``I think they did better in Europe than most people expected,''
Heaney said. ``GM, last year through the first three quarters,
didn't make any money on their North American operations. In the
fourth quarter it began to kick in.''
   Maryann Keller of Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney agreed,
saying, ``I was up at the high end (at $2 a share) of where the
world was. ... The benefit came from overseas and the benefit came
from North America.''
   While GM was spreading good news about its earnings on Thursday,
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca was spreading hope for the future in
the nation's third-largest automaker.
   Chrysler said it earned $112.5 million, or 50 cents a share, on
sales of $7.01 billion during the July-September period this year.
During the three-month period last year, Chrysler said it earned
$246 million, or $1.12 a share, on sales of $6.17 billion.
   In a statement, Chrysler said its earnings were hurt by high
costs of incentives, which the company used extensively to lure
buyers into showrooms, and the closing for the entire period of the
Newark, Del., assembly plant.
   For the first nine months of this year, Chrysler's earnings fell
34.4 percent to $616.6 million, or $2.77 a share, from $939.5
million, or $4.33 a share, last year. Sales for the first nine
months of 1988 amounted to $23.17 billion, compared with $18.61
billion in 1987, a 24.5 percent increase.
   ``We're launching promising products here and overseas, and we're
proceeding with our plan to spend $13.5 billion in the next five
years on new products, processes and plant improvements,'' Iacocca
said. ``These investments will give us an edge as we do battle with
scores of competitors from every corner of the globe.''
   Also Thursday, Chrysler Financial Corp. reported record
third-quarter earnings of $59 million, 20 percent more than the $49
million it earned during the third quarter of last year. For the
first nine months of 1988, the financial arm of the corporation
earned $185 million, a nine-month record and up 12 percent from the
$166 million it earned during the January-September period last year.

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. said Thursday it has postponed a
sale of $1.15 billion in junk bonds to consider restructuring the
issue, which is needed to help finance its acquisition of Federated
Department Stores Inc.
   The Toronto-based compaa retail industry analyst with Prescott Ball
&
Turben who tracks Campeau, said investors were uneasy about the
overall leveraged buyout situation, but said there also were
concerns about Campeau's financial health.
   Johnson said the sales of Campeau's Federated and Allied Stores
units had not been strong, noting that the store divisions reported
hefty losses from high interest expenses in its most recent
quarterly report.
   In that report, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Campeau said sales at Federated's department store units
either declined or eked out gains of less than 1 percent during the
quarter ended July 30. Sales were lackluster even at the company's
star Bloomingdale's division.
   Federated lost $100 million during the quarter, while Allied lost
$107 million.
   The Campeau source denied that Federated's problems had anything
to do with the postponement of the issue.
   ``The business is very strong; the (bond) market is in turmoil,''
the source said.

   Stock prices tumbled Thursday in selling
attributed to investors' misgivings over the recent wave of
corporate buyout bids.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 24.35 to 2,140.83.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 196.54 million

consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,

   Huge bids for companies like RJR Nabisco and Kraft in recent days
have stirred conflicting emotions on Wall Street.
   While deals like these bring opportunities for large short-term

   RJR Nabisco shares dropped 2} to 82 and Kraft fell 3 to 94{,
ranking among the most active Big Board issues.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., an investment firm seeking to
acquire RJR, said it was ``extremely confident'' of getting
financing for its bid.
   Sears Roebuck, which had climbed sharply of late on talk of a
possible restructuring or other transaction, lost 1{ to 43\.
   Pillsbury, the target of a takeover bid by Grand Metropolitan PLC

   Golden Nugget rose } to 13}. The company said directors approved
a plan to repurchase as many as 5 million of its shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

   Pennzoil Co. said Thursday its earnings soared
eightfold in the third quarter as the company continued to benefit
from a record cash settlement of its litigation with Texaco Inc.
   Pennzoil said all segments of its Houston-based energy company
contributed toward the improved profits, with increased earnings in
the oil and gas, sulphur and refinery operations.
   For the third quarter, after-tax profits totaled $39.8 million,
or 93 cents per share, compared with $4.7 million, or 2 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 37.1 percent to $617 million from $450
million in the July-September quarter of 1987.
   Profits for the first nine months of 1988 were $1.4 billion, or
$36 per share, on revenues of $1.65 billion, compared with $26
million, or 35 cents per share, on revenues of $1.34 billion during
the same 1987 period.
   Earnings for the nine-month period of 1988 include a $1.7 billion
extraordinary gain, or $41.83 per share, associated with the $3
billion cash settlement with Texaco.
   Earlier this year, Pennzoil agreed to accept the settlement from
Texaco to resolve an $11.1 billion court judgment won by Pennzoil
against its oil company rival in a 1985 Texas trial. In that case, a
jury found Texaco had interfered with Pennzoil's plan to buy Getty
Oil Co.
   In the most recent quarter, Pennzoil also showed after-tax
non-cash charges of $303 million, or $7.65 per share, resulting from
the disposition and write-down of certain assets and other charges.
   Third-quarter earnings improved dramatically because of
investment income and increased operating income in all divisions,
including $5.1 million from Facet Enterprises Inc., a filtration
products company acquired in May 1988.
   Investment income in the third quarter was $53.3 million,
compared with $11.2 million in the third quarter of 1987, the
company said.
   Operating income from oil and gas production was $7.1 million in
the third quarter, compared with the same 1987 period and petroleum
products showed a gain of $33 million in the quarter, compared with
$30 million a year earlier.

but money dealers said the underlying trend for the U.S. currency is
down.
   Gold prices eased in New York after strengthening in Europe.
Republic National Bank quoted bullion at $407.50 a troy ounce as of
4 p.m. EDT, down from $408.15 at the same time Wednesday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar weakened early in the day based
on its sharp decline Wednesday, when a government report of
slower-than-expected U.S. economic growth depressed the dollar to
the lowest level in four months.
   But rumors quickly surfaced that the Bank of Japan had intervened
by buying dollars to support the currency. Traders said there were
other rumors, later denied, that the Swiss and West German central
banks were buying dollars.
   The dollar strengthened on those rumors although it lost ground
to the British pound, which surged on news of Britain's narrowing
trade deficit.
   ``We actually saw the dollar move in a relatively wide range,''
said David Jacques, senior corporate dealer at the New York branch
of Barclays Bank PLC. ``Most of the movement on the back of
unconcrete information.''
   Zlatko Glamuzina, a senior trader for the New York branch of
Banco di Sicilia, said that because of the rumors and the dollar's
upward move, ``we lost the drive to push the dollar down.''
   Although he predicted the dollar could rise more over the next
few days, ``there are quite a few people who expect the dollar to go
lower.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.90 Japanese yen to 125.90 yen. Later
in London it slipped further to 125.75 yen. But by the time trading
ended in New York the dollar had rebounded to 126.08 yen, higher
than its 125.70-yen value Wednesday.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.7695 from $1.7600
Wednesday. Later in New York the pound fetched $1.7675, higher than
its $1.7610 value Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York vs. rates late Wednesday:
1.7783 West German marks, up from 1.7750; 1.4982 Swiss francs, down
from 1.5041; 1.2050 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1993; 6.0680 French
francs, up from 6.0595; and 1,323.12 Italian lire, up from 1,322.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe vs. rates late Wednesday:
1.7725 marks, down from 1.7745; 1.4915 Swiss francs, down from
1.5065; 6.0455 French francs, down from 6.0725; 1.9977 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0005; 1,320.00 Italian lire, down from
1,323.50; and 1.2024 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1988.
   In gold trading, the Commodity Exchange of New York quoted
bullion for current delivery at $407.60 a troy ounce, down 70 cents.
   Earlier in London, gold rose 45 cents to $407.50; in Zurich it
rose 10 cents to $407.20; in Hong Kong it fell 54 cents to $409.22.
   Silver bullion for current delivery fell 2.4 cents a troy ounce
to $6.20 on the New York Comex. In London silver fetched $6.22,
unchanged from Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Elderly people who are ``house rich and cash
poor'' will be able to apply for government-backed reverse mortgages
that could pay them up to several hundred dollars a month for the
rest of their lives, under a plan announced Thursday.
   The demonstration project sponsored by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development and backed by federal lending institutions
will provide 2,500 home equity conversion mortgages beginning next
April. The reverse mortgage, in effect, gives the elderly income in
exchange for a lien on their property.
   ``This is another option to help older people survive and thrive
in our country,'' said Carol Fraser Fisk, national commissioner on
aging, who appeared with housing officials at a news conference
announcing the plan.
   To be eligible, applicants must be at least 62 years old, either
own or have a very low mortgage on the home in which they live, and
undergo counseling by HUD housing experts. Such counseling
ordinarily would include potential heirs to the property, who likely
would have to sell the house to pay off the principal, interest and
mortgage fees after the borrower dies, officials said.
   The reverse mortgages will be available from regular lending
institutions but will be backed by the government so there will be
no risk of payments being cut off or of loss to the lender, said
Kenneth J. Beirne, assistant housing secretary. By pooling the risk,
lenders will be protected against the small percentage of cases in
which borrowers might live long enough to collect more than the
value of the house, he said.
   ``Too many Americans who work most of their lives to pay off
their mortgages wake up one morning to find that they are house rich
and cash poor,'' said Rep. George C. Wortley, R-N.Y., who worked on
legislation setting up the program.
   The project effectively will double the number of reverse
mortgages available in the United States. About 2,000 have been
issued by private lenders in about seven states, most of them
allowing the lender to share in the increased value of the home. HUD
also may insure such loans, but lender profits generally would be
limited to interest on the loan and a possible co-insurance
arrangement where they absorb some of the risk involved, officials
said.
   ``It will be possible for the elderly to take out a reverse
mortgage without putting out a penny,'' said Judith V. May, HUD
policy analyst who helped design the program.
   She said borrowers can either receive monthly payments that will
end only if they die or sell the house, or they may get payments for
a set term or a line of credit that can be drawn upon as they need
it.
   The amount available will depend on the interest rate, age of the
youngest borrower, value of the house and the maximum Federal
Housing Administration loan available for the area where the house
is located.
   The maximum ranges from $67,500 to $101,250. Monthly payments on
a 10 percent mortgage would range from $81 for a 62-year-old
borrower in a house valued at $50,000 to $662 for an 85-year-old in
a house valued at $100,000 or more. The older the applicant, the
higher the amount of money available.
   Some adjustments could be made before final rules are adopted,
following a 60-day period for public comment, officials said.
   The limited number of loans to be available initially will be
distributed by regions of the country according to the number of
elderly home owners living in the area, officials said.
   Representatives of the Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac)
announced they would purchase loans under the plan.
   HUD says 73 percent of America's 18.9 million elderly own their
own homes, and 83 percent of those, or 11.5 million, owe nothing on
them.
   That creates a potential reverse mortgage market of $700 billion,
said William A. Schainker, Fannie Mae senior vice president.

<HEAD>Data General Losses Widen In Quarter; Prime Earnings Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Data General Corp., the minicomputer company, said Thursday its
losses widened to nearly $50 million in the latest quarter because
of a major charge to pay for a cost-cutting consolidation.
   Prime Computer Inc., another minicomputer maker, said its
third-quarter profit fell 26 percent in spite of the increased
revenue from its acquisition of Computervision Corp.
   The company said its fortunes were improving because revenue was
up and income from operations, not counting restructuring charges,
had also increased.
   Data General, based in Westboro, Mass., said it lost $49.8
million in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 24, double the losses of
$24.6 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 3 percent to $341.5
million from $332.3 million.
   A restructuring charge of $48.7 million in the quarter covered
the cost of consolidation of manufacturing and product repair
operations.
   For the full fiscal year, Data General said its losses fell to
$15.5 million from $123.7 million a year earlier. The 1987 period
included a restructuring charge of $53.8 million. Revenue for the
fiscal year rose 7 percent to $1.36 billion from $1.27 billion.
   Prime Computer in Natick, Mass., attributed its own earnings
decline to reorganization and softening demand.
   For the third quarter, earnings totaled $11.7 million, or 24
cents per share, on revenue of $391.4 million, compared with
earnings of $15.9 million, or 32 cents per share, on revenue of
$236.2 million in 1987.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, net income totaled
$33.4 million, or 69 cents a share, down from $43.5 million, or 88
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.16 billion from
$694 million.
   The 1987 results do not include Computervision, which Prime
acquired in February 1988.

<HEAD>Copper See-Saws On Concerns Over Strike In Peru</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead to CLARIFY prices touched lows and rebounded, also
CORRECT demand to supplies.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices touched the lows of the week
before rallying Thursday at the New York Commodity Exchange, where a
strike in Peru and tight supplies remained the major concerns.
   In other markets, wheat prices were mixed; corn and soybeans
declined; gold and silver prices dipped; cattle prices were mostly
lower and hog prices fell. Crude oil and heating oil rallied but
unleaded gasoline prices were mostly lower.
   Copper prices continued the slide that began Wednesday on
expectations of possible negotiations between striking miners and
officials in Peru, one of the world's major copper producers, but
the slide was reversed later in the session, analysts said.
   As the session progressed, there were no signs of an imminent
settlement to the strike, which could further restrict already tight
copper supplies, said Bette Raptopoulous, a metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   ``One of the major producers says if the strike continues,
they'll declare a `force majeure,''' a declaration of an inability
to deliver supplies, she said, and anticipation of tightening
supplies sparked a late flurry of buying. Copper prices settled .35
cent to 1.65 cents higher, with October at $1.38 cents a pound.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, word from the U.S. Agriculture
Department that China is being offered 550,000 tons of wheat under
the export bonus plan sparked buying in the wheat pit, analysts said.
   But the slide of corn and soybean prices confirmed sentiment that
Wednesday's late rally ``was just a bubble,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a Chicago trader with Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.
   Harvest pressure, lack of demand and improved weather in South
America, a major soybean producer, all kept the lid on prices,
Lespinasse said.
   ``The markets are showing their true colors'' after Wednesday's
rally, he said.
   Wheat settled } cent lower to 4 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in December at $4.11{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 5}
cents lower, with December at $2.74} a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to
7} cents lower, with December at $2.32\ a bushel; and soybeans were
5 cents to 9 cents lower, with November at $7.59 a bushel.
   Cattle prices were mostly lower and hog prices declined in
trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Reports of good box beef movement added an early firm tone to
cattle prices, but they fell on concerns over ample supplies of
competitive meats later in the day, said Tom Morgan, president of
Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   A weaker cash market sparked selling in the live hog pit, while
larger-than-expected movement of pork bellies into storage last week
pressured belly prices, he said.
   Live cattle prices settled .23 cent lower to .2 cent higher, with
December at 73.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.05 cents lower
to .5 cent higher, with October at 81.45 cents a pound; live hogs
were .05 cent to .53 cent lower, with December at 41.21 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.07 cents to 1.40 cents lower,
with February at 48.10 a pound.
   Trading in gold and silver was quiet at the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where traders are moving cautiously in the waning days
before the U.S. presidential election, Ms. Raptopoulous said.
   Uncertainty over the U.S. dollar and crude oil prices also has
kept a lid on activity in the precious metals pits, she said.
   Gold prices settled 70 cents to $1.40 lower, with the contract
for delivery in October at $407.60 a troy ounce; silver prices were
2.4 cents to 3.4 cents lower, with October at $6.20 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices rallied while unleaded gasoline prices settled
mixed in trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Selling on technical factors pressured gasoline prices, while
trading in crude oil was quiet as traders cautiously await some word
from OPEC on production quotas, said Peter Beutel, an analyst with
Elders Futures Inc. in
   Crude oil prices settled unchanged to 27 cents higher, with the
December contract at $13.68 dollars a barrel; heating oil prices
were .64 cent to 1.49 cents higher, with November at 43.04 cents a
gallon; and unleaded gas was .95 cent lower to 1.12 cents higher,
with November at 50.72 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>KaiserTech Stockholders Approve $708 Million Buyout By Maxxam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stockholders of KaiserTech Ltd., parent of
Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., on Thursday approved a $708
million buyout by Maxxam Group Inc.
   The transaction, which already has been approved by the boards of
both companies, will bring KaiserTech stockholders $19.37{ per
share. When the deal is completed in the next few days, KaiserTech
will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Maxxam.
   KaiserTech is the nation's third-largest aluminum producer.
Maxxam is involved in real estate and lumber.
   James S. Pasman Jr., president and chief executive officer of
KaiserTech and chairman of Kaiser Aluminum, said he and other
company managers will remain in their jobs and the company will keep
its headquarters in Oakland.
   Charles E. Hurwitz, chairman and chief executive officer of
Maxxam, said he will not be involved with day-to-day management of
KaiserTech and intends to preserve the company's identity as an
aluminum producer.
   Pasman said he is part of a broad management group that would
hold about 15 percent equity in the company under terms still to be
negotiated.
   KaiserTech has rebounded in the past year from six years of
losses, amid a major restructuring and cost-cutting effort. The
company had a profit of $166.2 million for the first nine months of
1988 on revenue of $1.72 billion, compared with a nine-month loss of
$406.8 million last year after restructuring costs.
   Maxxam plans to shed many of KaiserTech's assets to help reduce
the debt burden assumed in financing the takeover deal. Those assets
include: a fabrication plant in Ravenswood, W.Va.; a coil coating
plant in Toledo, Ohio; a recycling plant in Bedford, Ind; and the
company's electrical products division.
   Other assets that could be sold are some real estate properties
and foreign joint-venture interests.

   CSX Corp. said Thursday it increased the
number of shares it is repurchasing in a self-tender offer to 43.1
million, for a total of $1.4 billion, as part of its restructuring
program.
   Under the self-tender offer CSX announced Sept. 20, it initially
planned to buy back 40 million common shares, or about 26 percent of
shares outstanding. The offer expired on Oct. 18.
   CSX said it would pay stockholders $32 for each of the 43.1
million shares.
   The company's board has authorized the repurchase of up to 60
million shares, or about 38 percent of stock outstanding. CSX said
in its statement that it plans to buy the remainder of the 60
million shares from time to time on the open market, in private
transactions or other dealings.
   As part of the restructuring plan, CSX is selling off several
non-transportation operations and offering early retirement programs
to employees.

<HEAD>UAL, Delta Post Higher Profit in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines and the parent of United Airlines reported
Thursday that strong passenger traffic boosted their third-quarter
profit substantially from a year earlier.
   Chicago-based UAL Corp. said its net income in the three months
ended Sept. 30 more than quadrupled to $402.4 million, or $18.68 a
share, from $82.3 million, or $1.41 a shre, a year earlier.
   The latest per-share profit was calculated on the basis of about
21.5 million shares outstanding, while the third quarter of 1987 was
based on 58.4 million shares.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to $2.41 billion from $2.26 billion.
   UAL, whose main subsidiary is United, said its revenue passenger
miles increased 5 percent during the quarter from a year earlier. A
revenue passenger mile represents one paying passenger flown one
mile and is used to determine an airline's capacity.
   United is the nation's largest airline.
   In August, UAL completed the sale of 50 percent of its interest
in the Covia partnership, which owns the Apollo computer
reservations system, for $499 million. UAL, formerly called Allegis
Corp., sold the stake to five airlines: Alitalia, British Airways,
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and USAir Group Inc.
   In the first nine months of the year, UAL's profit surged to
$1.10 billion, or $34.35 a share, from $125.2 million, or $2.26 a
share.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $6.75 billion from $6.19 billion.
   ``While we are pleased with the achievements of the last three
quarters, we understand we must produce these kinds of results
consistently if we are to meet the capital requirements of replacing
and expanding our fleet,'' Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said.
   Atlanta-based Delta, the third-largest U.S. airline, said its
third-quarter profit jumped 69 percent to $99.95 million, or $2.03 a
share, from $59.1 million, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 15 percent, to $1.88 billion from
$1.63 billion.
   ``Strong growth in passenger revenue was a principal ingredient
in Delta's record financial results,'' said Thomas J. Roeck, chief
financial officer.
   Revenue passenger miles were up 10 percent, reflecting ``general
good economic conditions, the benefits of our merger with Western
Air Lines, and growth in domestic and international operations,''
Roeck said.
   In the first nine months, net income surged 80 percent to $259.4
million, or $5.30 a share. Nine-month revenue increased 18 percent,
to $5.47 billion from $4.65 billion.

<HEAD>Broadest Money Measures Rose</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in mid-October, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,043.1 billion in the week ended Oct. 17 from $3,036.1
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,870 billion from $3,864.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $783.6 billion from $784.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $100 million in
the week ended Oct. 19, compared with a gain of $427 million a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System discount window averaged $411 million excluding
extended credit in the week ended Wednesday, down from $600 million
in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $283.2 billion in the two-week period ended Oct. 19, up from
$282.1 billion two weeks earlier.

   Tenneco Inc. reported a third-quarter profit of $7
million on Thursday, compared with a $117 million loss posted for
the same period last year.
   Tenneco's 1988 third-quarter earnings amounted to 2 cents per
share. Revenue for the 1988 quarter was $3 billion, compared with
$2.8 billion last year.
   Third-quarter results included an after-tax loss of $42 million
from discontinued operations of Tenneco Oil Co., which is being sold
to several different buyers for an estimated $7.3 billion.
   That compares with a loss from discontinued operations of $101
million for the same period last year, which includes the
discontinued operations for 1987 of Tenneco Oil and the since-sold
Tenneco West operations.
   ``We continue to work toward further strengthening of our
remaining businesses and managing them for maximum earnings, cash
generation and return on assets through a focus on cost containment,
efficiency enhancement and accelerated disposition of
underperforming assets within each of the divisions,'' said James L.
Ketelsen, chairman and chief executive officer.
   For the nine months, net earnings totaled $224 million, or $1.39
per share, compared with a net loss of $42 million for the 1987
nine-month period.
   Revenue for the nine months was $9.6 billion this year and $8.7
billion last year.
   With the sale of its oil and gas properties, Tenneco's biggest
units will be the profitable natural gas pipeline and its Case IH
farm equipment manufacturing sector.
   Tenneco also maintains shipbuilding, automotive packaging and
chemicals units.

   Decision time may be near for the Detroit Free

its partial merger with The Detroit News prepared to go back to
federal appeals court.
   Newspapers officials are hoping a victory before the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. scheduled to hear arguments in
the case Friday convinces opponents of a joint operating agreement
to forgo a Supreme Court challenge.
   That would allow the newspapers to merge advertising, circulation
and business operations _ while keeping separate news and editorial
departments _ a move they have said is vital if the Free Press is to
survive.
   An adverse ruling by the three-judge panel could force
Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of the 157-year-old Free Press, to decide
whether it wants to pursue a lengthy Supreme Court battle.
   ``That's such a hypothetical question, I don't see any value in
speculating on something like that,'' Knight-Ridder spokesman Frank
Hawkins Jr. said.
   Gannett Co. Inc., owner of the News, has said it will operate the
News with or without a JOA.
   Knight-Ridder has said if a JOA were denied it would close the
Free Press, putting its 2,200 employees out of work.
   But Hawkins said he didn't know if the chain would choose to ride
out another year or more of uncertainty and newspaper losses that a
Supreme Court battle would involve.
   ``The options are beginning to narrow now,'' he said.
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese approved a JOA in an Aug. 8
ruling. But hours before it was to take effect, opponents obtained
an order from the appellate court barring the newspapers from
enacting it.
   Federal law provides for a limited antitrust exemption to permit
a JOA if it would preserve competing editorial voices in a community.
   Administrative Law Judge Morton Needelman recommended last
December after hearings in Detroit that Meese deny a JOA, saying the
newspapers failed to prove they would fail without the merger.
   The opponents include Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press,
a group of more than 500 readers, advertisers and newspaper
employees, and Public Citizen, a Washington-based group founded by
Ralph Nader.
   Arguing the newspapers' case will be Washington attorney Clark
Clifford and Justice Department lawyer Douglas Letter.
   Arguing against a JOA will be Public Citizen lawyer William
Schultz.
   Each side will be allotted 20 minutes. There is no deadline for a
ruling by the panel of Judges Laurence H. Silberman, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Spottswood Robinson III.

   Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc.
said Thursday it has formed a new unit to build small-volume
specialty vehicles, or niche cars, for its large automaker customers.
   The new Vehma International Inc. will prove its capabilities by
unveiling a high-performance concept car at the Society of
Automotive Engineers' International Congress and Exposition in
February in Detroit, Manfred Gingl, Magna president, said at a news
conference.
   ``It will measure up to anything which is running on four wheels
today,'' Gingl said.
   He said the car won't compete with the big manufacturers.
   The aim is to show them that the design, styling, engineering,
tooling, manufacturing and testing capabilities Magna already uses
to supply parts can be combined to produce entire cars, Gingl said.
   Vehma is negotiating with ``one or more'' auto companies for such
contracts, he said.
   He said depending on the outcome, Vehma may build one or more
assembly plants in Canada or the United States.
   Magna currently employs 13,000 people at 120 plants in Canada,
the United States and Europe and makes more than 6,000 products for
the global automotive market. It had sales of $1.2 billion in its
1988 fiscal year, which ended July 31.
   Magna is made up of four subsidiaries: Cosma International,
making body parts; Atoma International, making interior assemblies;
Decoma International, making exterior trim, and Tesma International,
making drivetrain systems.
   Gingl said Vehma would carry out assembly operations involving
8,000 to 15,000 cars a year. A moderately sized plant operated by a
major automaker produces volumes in the 250,000-a-year range.
   Vehma could build one of its specialized plants for $40 million
to $70 million, he said.
   Auto analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors in New York said
an automaker could save by contracting with Vehma to assemble a
vehicle aimed at a small marketing niche rather than interrupting a
high-volume assembly line for such a project.
   Profits would have to be high to justify contracting out the
work, Sudol said.
   ``It could make sense to farm them out if they were upmarket
vehicles with large profit margins and limited runs. I don't think
you could build econoboxes that way,'' she said.
   Gingl said the operation would not resemble companies that take
manufacturers' finished vehicles and modify them _ to make
convertibles or custom vans, for example. ``I'm not talking about a
conversion factory here,'' he said.

   The price Americans pay for imported goods fell
1.1 percent from July through September, the first decline in more
than two years, the government reported Thursday.
   The Labor Department attributed the quarterly drop to a fall in
crude oil prices and a rise in the value of the dollar against
overseas currencies.
   A stronger dollar boosts Americans' purchasing power for foreign
goods and also tends to make U.S. exports more expensive. U.S.
export prices rose 2 percent during the July-September quarter, the
department said.
   The report said the dollar, after falling in value for three
years, rose by 4.2 percent on a trade-weighted basis against other
currencies during the third quarter. It had edged up by 0.3 percent
in the second quarter.
   Despite these increases, the dollar is still 28.8 percent lower
than its high point reached in March 1985, according to the currency
index used by the Labor Department.
   Many economists contend that further improvement in the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit will require further declines in the
dollar, with some suggesting a drop of 20 percent may be needed.
   The United States ran a record $170.3 billion merchandise trade
deficit for all of 1987. For the first eight months of this year,
the deficit has been running at an annual rate of $139 billion.
   The 1.1 percent drop in import prices from July through September
was the first since a 3.3 percent decline in the first quarter of
1986 that was attributed primarily to a fall in energy prices.
   Lower oil prices also played a large part in the July-September
drop. Without a 7.1 percent plunge in the price of imported energy,
the overall import decline would have been a smaller 0.6 percent.
   There were also declines in other areas, including a 1.1 percent
drop in imported food prices and a 0.5 percent redcution in
machinery prices.
   Even with the July-September decline, import prices are still 4.1
percent higher than they were a year ago.
   The 2 percent rise in export prices followed a 2.8 percent
increase in the April-June quarter. Export prices are now 8.7
percent higher than a year ago.
   Food exports led the list of third-quarter price increases,
shooting up 14.8 percent in reflecting the impact of the summer
drought in the Farm Belt.
   Food exports had risen by 8.6 percent in the second quarter and
are now 36.8 percent higher than a year ago.
   The category of machinery and transport equipment, which
constitutes nearly one-half of U.S. exports, rose by 0.5 percent in
the third quarter following a 0.8 percent rise in the second quarter.
   Prices of crude materials, which had been rising rapidly, edged
up just 0.6 percent in the third quarter, the smallest increase in
two years.

<HEAD>FTC Subpoenas Raleses In Anti-Trust Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA WOMACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission has subpoenaed the
owners of a partnership making a $2.7 billion hostile takeover bid
for Interco Inc. in connection with an investigation of possible
antitrust violations, the partnership disclosed Thursday.
   Steven M. and Mitchell P. Rales, City Capital Associates Limited
Partnership, and others were served with subpoenas on Oct. 24
requiring the Raleses to produce documents, said Cindy Carpenter, a
spokesperson for the brothers.
   Ms. Carpenter, an employee of D.F. King & Co., said neither her
company nor the Raleses, who are Washington, D.C., businessmen,
would comment regarding the subpoena.
   The Rales brothers lead an investor group that controls about 8.7
percent of Interco's stock, and has offered to pay $74 a share to
acquire the St. Louis-based furniture and apparel company.
   In August, Interco charged in a lawsuit that the group violated
various provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino federal antitrust law.
Sens. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., and Christopher Bond, R-Mo., then
asked the FTC to expedite its investigation of the hostile bid for
Interco.
   A statement issued Thursday on behalf of the Raleses reiterated
the partnership's previous contention that it believed it had not
violated the antitrust law in connection with the purchase of
Interco shares.
   It also noted that the Delaware District Court on Sept. 23, 1988
concluded that Interco failed to prove that antitrust laws were
violated in connection with the purchase of its shares by the Rales
group.
   Interco rejected the Rales offer on Sept. 20 and countered with a
multibillion-dollar defensive restructuring that includes special
$25-a-share dividend to its stockholders.
   The company is the maker of London Fog rainwear, Ethan Allen
furniture and Florsheim shoes, among other products.
   Interco said it was considering alternatives to the Rales offer,
including the possible sale of the company to other parties. In a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Interco said confidential
information had been given to unnamed parties that agreed not to buy
Interco stock or make an offer for three years without Interco's
permission.
   The Rales brothers own Congressional Construction Corp., which
markets home siding for Sears; Mid-South Building Supply; and Easco
Hand Tools, Inc., which makes the Craftsman line of hand tools. In
August, the Rales won regulatory approval to take over local radio
station WGMS in partnership.
   The FTC scrutinizes bidders in takeover attempts to ensure that
companies comply with various disclosure provisions and waiting
periods that give the agency information to determine if companies
violated antitrust and disclosure laws.
   If an investor group led by the Rales brothers were found guilty
of violating antitrust laws, the FTC could impose fines, bar future
purchases of Interco stock and force the divestiture of Interco
shares.
   But Ms. Carpenter issued a statement Thursday saying ``The
Purchaser believes that the investigation will have no impact upon
the offer.''

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Stocks Down In Tokyo Morning Session</HEAD>

   The U.S. dollar moved higher against the Japanese
yen Friday morning, while stock prices declined moderately.
   After opening at 126.10 yen, up 0.20 yen from Thursday's close,
the dollar held to a narrow range and was changing hands at 126.04
yen by mid-morning.
   Currency dealers said the market was being cautious about
possible intervention by the nation's central bank to brake any
sudden plunge in the dollar.
   The Bank of Japan stepped into the market to buy dollars and prop
up the U.S. currency Thursday when the dollar opened at a four-month
low. The opening followed the release of U.S. quarterly economic
figures showing unexpectedly lower growth during the July-September
period.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 102.31-point
winner the previous day, was down 100.67 points at 27,622.25 by the
close of the morning session.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dealers said the slip in the
market's main barometer was triggered by profit-taking among some
investors after three consecutive days of gains in the index.
   ``The market still has a lot of energy, but the index isn't
moving yet,'' said one dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo,
speaking anonymously.
