<HEAD>Proud Bird Takes Aim at Atlantic Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A six-man crew determined to break the record
for a trans-Atlantic voyage set off Sunday from New York aboard a
$6 million speedboat.
   Honolulu businessman Thomas Gentry, 57, and his crew passed
Ambrose Light just outside New York Harbor at 11:26 a.m. Sunday to
start the race across the North Atlantic to Bishop Rock off Great
Britain's Isles of Scilly, race spokesman Mark Jaffe said.
   The 110-foot, 11,460 horsepower Gentry-Continental Proud Bird,
sponsored by Continental Airlines, will attempt to cross the
Atlantic in less than 72 hours. The current record time of 3 days,
8 hours and 31 minutes was set in 1986 by Englishman Richard
Branson.
   Branson, who owns Virgin Atlantic Airways and several other
companies, set his record on June 29, 1986, in the Virgin Atlantic
Challenger II. It was Branson's second attempt at the crossing. His
first attempt, in May 1985, failed when the original Virgin
Atlantic Challenger sank 138 miles short of the finish.
   Crew member Jeffery Brown, speaking by radio-telephone, said the
Proud Bird had passed over the Nantucket Shoals about 3:30 p.m.
Sunday. The vessel was cruising at 50 knots through six-foot swells
and fog, he said.
   ``We'd like a little smoother seas,'' Brown said.
   ``Basically the autopilot is doing the driving and we're just
kind of cruising along,'' he said.
   However, the boat's size, speed and sea conditions were making
for a rough passage.
   ``It's not a comfy ride. There's a rolling and pitching motion
and when you hit these swells. You feel a few inches shorter and
like you've been punched in the stomach,'' Brown reported.

   Communist rebels said Sunday that
President Corazon Aquino has failed to lift the country out of
crisis and the United States may have to send troops to prop up the
government.
   The rebels, who have been battling for power for 20 years,
issued a statement on the eve of the president's state of the
nation address.
   Meanwhile, four soldiers, a policeman and two guerrillas were
killed in three separate battles across the country during the last
24 hours, the military said Sunday.
   The rebels said Mrs. Aquino ``cannot cover up the basic truth
that the Filipino nation remains in deep crisis, that U.S. control
and interference continue to fetter national development, that the
nation is being ever more polarized along class and political lines.
   ``Direct armed intervention by American troops is a distinct
possibility _ meaning a much bloodier war for the Filipino people _
should the U.S. imperialists judge that the Aquino regime can no
longer stop the general advance of the people's democratic
revolution and protect strategic American interests.''
   Copies of the statement were were delivered to news agencies by
the National Democratic Front. The front is an umbrella for 12
rebel groups, including the outlawed Communist Party and its
25,000-member New People's Army.
   The government gave no official response to the rebels'
statement.
   Mrs. Aquino is to address the nation Monday when Congress
reconvenes for its second session after a month-long recess.
   In the fighting, the army said that on Panay Island, 230 miles
southeast of Manila, communist rebels ambushed and killed four
soldiers Saturday.
   On Luzon island, one of three attackers Saturday shot and killed
a policeman as he left his home near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base,
about 50 miles north of Manila.
   Also Saturday, two suspected communist rebels were killed in a
gun battle after they wounded a Philippine constabulary captain in
Cabanatuan, 30 miles northeast of the base.
   The military said last week nearly 2,000 people have been killed
in insurgency-related violence across the country in the first six
months of the year.

   Two drug-dealing gangs waged a gunfight over
control of the local cocaine trade, killing 11 people and wounding
dozens of others, police reported Sunday.
   They said the battle in the village of Dos de Mayo, 240 miles
northeast of Lima, began Thursday when a Colombian gang ambushed
Peruvians as they transported about 260 pounds of cocaine paste to
a rural airfield.
   The firefight lasted for several hours and at least six Peruvian
traffickers and five Colombians were killed, according to police.
Witnesses told police that dozens of people were wounded, but
officials had no specific figures.
   A Peruvian police patrol arrived in the area shortly after the
battle ended and confiscated the cocaine, according to the
authorities.

<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether it's Michael Dukakis or George Bush,
the next taker of the presidential oath of office may find the
federal government more miserly about paying part of the tab when
he kicks up his heels at the end of the day.
   The reason: Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., has slipped new rules
into the conference report of the new defense authorization bill
now awaiting President Reagan's signature.
   They require the next Presidential Inaugural Committee to
reimburse the Defense Department for equipment and personnel it
supplies for inaugural balls and other private inaugural events.
   So, Proxmire says, when President Bush or President Dukakis
steps out on the dance floor at an invitation-only inaugural ball
next Jan. 20, ``the American taxpayer will no longer have to foot
part of the bill.''
   Proxmire, citing a recent General Accounting Office study, said
that when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated for the second time in
1985, ``many of the events were largely planned, staffed and
executed by federal employees at a cost to the taxpayer of $15.5
million.''
   The Pentagon alone spent $10 million,'' Proxmire says.
   And it used 8,400 military personnel.
   According to Proxmire staff members and the General Accounting
Office, hundreds of uniformed military personnel were used at
Reagan's nine inaugural balls and galas to do everything from
checking the fur coats to playing in the bands and orchestras.
   Service members served as VIP escorts, driving visiting
celebrities around the capital.
   The cars were lent by American auto makers, but the Pentagon
maintained them, and filled the gas tanks.
   Members of the inaugural committees had military drivers for as
long as six weeks.
   Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps personnel served as
escorts at inaugural events, under orders to mix and mingle and to
see that no guests were ignored.
   They also were used to set up the events themselves, and to
organize receiving lines once they were under way.
   Military photographers and cameramen took still and video
pictures of the guests, providing copies on request free of charge.
   ``They took tens of thousands of pictures,'' a Proxmire staff
member said.
   Under the new guidelines, the Bush or Dukakis inaugural
committee must reimburse the Pentagon for the costs of whatever
resources or personnel are used to supply private inaugural events.
   The inaugural ceremony itself would not be included because by
tradition and history it is a public event. Nor would the inaugural
parade down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol.
   But compensation would be required for Pentagon services to
private inaugural functions.
   The new Proxmire inaugural rules have one other twist.
   In the past, a Proxmire staff member said, members of Congress
have received complaints that service men and women were being
required to take part in private, partisan inaugural events, often
to perform duties they felt were beneath the dignity of the uniform.
   Under the new rules, uniformed members of the armed services
could be used at private, partisan inaugural celebrations _ but
only if they volunteer to take part.
   And the Pentagon would have to be reimbursed for the time spent.
   ``These new provisions provide clear and strict guidelines for
the future,'' Proxmire said.
   ``It has taken eight years to get movement on this issue, and
while not every loophole has been closed, the major abuses now are
corrected,'' he said.

   Three attackers shot and killed a
policeman near his house in front of his wife and two children near
the U.S.-run Clark Air Base, police reported Sunday.
   Police Capt. Marcelino Ibanez identified the victim as Patrolman
Jerico Gabiola. He said the attack occurred Saturday in Angeles
City, 50 miles north of Manila.
   The officer was opening the gate to his home when the gunmen
approached and one fired at close range with a 45-caliber pistol,
according to Ibanez.
   He said the killers escaped but a suspect was picked up Sunday
and was being questioned.
   There have been numerous killings in the vicinity of the Clark
Air Base and police blame communist rebels who have been fighting
the government for more than 19 years.

   A chartered fishing boat with 48 people aboard
collided with a Japanese navy submarine and quickly sank Saturday
near Tokyo Bay, leaving at least three people dead and 27 missing,
police said.
   The 92-foot boat, chartered for a weekend fishing expedition,
sank less than two minutes after the collision, said police in the
nearby port city of Yokosuka.
   They said 19 people were rescued from the boat but a 38-year-old
man died in a hospital. Divers subsequently recovered two bodies on
Sunday, said a spokesman for the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's
coast guard.
   None of the 75 men aboard the diesel-powered submarine were
reported injured, said officials with the Maritime Self-Defense
Force, Japan's navy.
   Officials said Sunday that divers located the boat at a depth of
more than 150 feet.
   Officials said about 80 divers and 40 boats were taking part in
the search.
   The Maritime Safety Agency spokesman said the cause of the
accident was still under investigation and captains of both vessels
had been called in for questioning.
   According to Japan Broadcasting Corp. television, the collision
occurred after one of the vessels swerved to the right to avoid
another boat.
   Television news reports showed the submarine floating on the
surface near the accident site with no apparent damage. A handful
of men on its deck and hull scanned the surrounding waters and life
rafts were lined along its top.
   Police officials said the submarine, the 2,200-ton Nadashio, hit
the fishing boat, the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru, Saturday afternoon
about two miles off the port of Yokosuka near the mouth of Tokyo
Bay. Yokosuka is 28 miles south of Tokyo.
   Capt. Yoshiaki Nishimura, a navy spokesman, told a nationally
televised news conference that the submarine was cruising on the
surface on its way back to Yokosuka after a training exercise in
the Pacific. The fishing boat, from the nearby port of Yokohama,
was leaving Tokyo Bay, he said.
   Authorities were still investigating the cause of the incident,
he said. Visibility at the time of the accident was reportedly good.
   More than 700 ships a day pass through the entrance of the bay,
Kyodo News Service reported.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who was attending meetings of
his Liberal Democratic Party in Karuizawa, returned to Tokyo after
hearing of the accident, news reports said.
   Defense Agency chief Tsutomu Kawara expressed regret over the
accident, the worst involving Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels
and civilian boats since World War II, defense officials said.
   It was the first collision in Japan between a submarine and a
Japanese civilian ship since 1981, when a U.S. nuclear submarine
hit a freighter, killing two people, Kyodo said.
   The mouth of Tokyo Bay is known for its congestion of military
vessels, including U.S. naval ships, ocean-going vessels, ferries,
fishing boats and privately owned yachts and sightseeing boats.
   Yokosuka is the site of a major U.S. Naval base.
   The submarine, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, was
commissioned in March 1984. It has two diesel engines and is
equipped with six torpedo tubes.

   Two areas of Yellowstone National Park were evacuated Saturday
because of forest fires in Wyoming, while residents of 20 homes
near Spokane, Wash., returned after the forest fire that forced
their evacuation was controlled.
   Fires also burned in California, Colorado, Oregon, Idaho and
Utah, and several large fires burned in remote areas of Alaska.
   Yellowstone National Park officials said Saturday the south
entrance to the park will be closed for several days. The Grant
Village Hotel and a campground in Yellowstone were closed earlier
in the day, and visitors and employees moved out as a precaution
because a fire had crept to within one-half mile of Lewis Lake.
   ``We had strong and erratic winds (Friday), a windstorm blew
trees down on the road,'' said park fire information officer Joan
Anzelmo. ``The same wind also kicked the fire in and had it moving
toward Grant Village.''
   In Idaho near the Wyoming border, 200 firefighters were strung
out along the two-mile-long northern flank of the North Fork fire
on the Idaho-Wyoming border that was burning mainly inside
Yellowstone, Targhee National Forest spokesman Bruce Fox said.
   Officials had worried that high winds forecast for Saturday
would aggravate the 600-acre blaze. But cloud cover kept both the
temperature and the wind from getting out of control, and crews
made progress on fire lines on the north flank, he said.
   ``We were anticipating it could double today if we got the wind.
But if we have another day like this, we might be coming close (to
containment),'' Fox said.
   Other fires in Yellowstone included the 14,000- to 15,000-acre
Clover fire in a remote backcountry area.
   Wind created problems for the 830 firefighters trying to contain
the Mink Creek fire in northwestern Wyoming that charred 21,300
acres in the Bridger-Teton National Forest and burned to within a
mile of Yellowstone's boundary.
   A containment line had been established around about 80 percent
of the fire's southern end, said Ed Waldapfel, fire information
officer.
   In southern Idaho, the Poison Creek fire in Sawtooth National
Forest southwest of Twin Falls was burning out of control Saturday.
More than 150 firefighters battled the blaze, which had charred
over 2,000 acres of the tinder-dry high desert since Thursday.
   Residents evacuated from about 20 homes bordering the Spokane
(Wash.) Indian Reservation returned home Saturday after
firefighters cut a containment line around a 2,420-acre blaze on
the reservation.
   However, officials were not yet calling the fire contained
because 40 percent of the material inside the line was unburned,
said Norm Anderson, a Wenatchee National Forest official.
   About 200 firefighters, including volunteers and crews from the
U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs, used bulldozers
and hand tools to cut the line around most of the fire, with the
Spokane River forming the rest of the boundary, Anderson said.
   Anderson estimated the fire got within 50 yards of at least one
home. The houses were evacuated Friday.
   Also Saturday, a 1,500-acre fire at the adjacent Colville
(Wash.) Indian Reservation was contained, said BIA fire control
officer Pat Quill. The blaze was blamed on farm equipment operating
in high grasses.
   About 50 people who were forced from their homes by a forest
fire on the outskirts of Kalispell, Mont., were allowed to return
Saturday after crews managed to get a line around the 120-acre
blaze. No homes were lost although several were threatened.
   ``We only have one road closed, and that's to try to find out
where it (the fire) started,'' said Flathead County Deputy Sheriff
Phil Caperton. Authorities believed the blaze, which broke out
Friday, was man-caused.
   Hundreds of firefighters battled about a half-dozen other fires
in western Montana. Two fires were being allowed to run their
course because they are in wilderness areas, including the Canyon
Creek fire in the Scapegoat Wilderness north of Ovando. Authorities
closed about 75,000 acres of the 250,000-acre wilderness on
Saturday due to the blaze.
   Marcia Hogan, a forest spokeswoman, said the blaze grew
substantially Saturday but that no estimate on its size was
available because smoke obscured much of the area. Earlier, the
fire was reported to have consumed 2,000 acres.
   A brush fire about eight miles north of Canon City, Colo., grew
to 1,700 acres Saturday afternoon as about 330 firefighters and
aircraft battled the blaze in steep terrain on Cooper Mountain.
   Bureau of Land Management spokesman Ken Smith blamed the growth
of the fire on winds.
   ``The wind has changed directions about three times today, and
now it's fairly calm again,'' Smith said. The blaze, which broke
out Thursday, is named the ``Dinosaur fire'' because it is near a
fossil site.
   Before the Dinosaur fire, fires had burned about 21,000 acres
across Colorado since last weekend. The other fires were all
contained by Thursday.
   In Southern California, a fire sparked by fireworks was
contained Saturday after it burned about 420 acres of the San
Bernardino National Forest near Yucaipa, said U.S. Forest Service
spokeswoman Melody Fountain.
   And in Northern California, firefighters finally contained two
fires in Calaveras County after the blazes charred about 10,800
acres. Dick Craig, a spokesman for the California Department of
Forestry, said full control of the blazes was expected by Monday
night.
   Damage from the fires totaled $11 million, including timber and
property losses and fire suppression efforts, said Sharon Torrence,
a spokeswoman for the CDF in Rail Road Flat, 150 miles east of San
Francisco and a few miles west of the fires.
   Six homes, nine other buildings and eight vehicles were lost
since the arson-suspected blazes broke out Tuesday.
   Also Saturday, firefighters battled a 200-acre brush fire near
Flaming Gorge Dam on the Utah-Colorado border and several small
fires near Salt Lake City, authorities said.

   A police officer was shot to death
Saturday when he responded to a car accident, authorities said.
   Officer David Payne, 26, was pronounced dead from a gunshot
wound after he was taken to Central Maine Medical Center in
Lewiston, said Police Chief Gregory Hanscom.
   Deputy Attorney General Fermand LaRochelle said Nicolo Leone, a
former Lewiston resident who lives in New York, was charged with
murder. Leone was in critical condition with gunshot wounds at the
medical center, a nursing supervisor said. A police guard was
posted at the hospital.
   Hanscom said Payne and two other officers responded to a report
of a car accident and that Payne, the first to arrive, approached a
man who ducked into the woods near the car.
   ``There was an exchange of gunfire,'' Hanscom said.
   A .44-caliber handgun was used in the killing, LaRochelle said.
   Payne, a father of two children ages 5 and 3, had been on the
police force two years.
   ``We grieve and feel terribly at the loss of this police
officer,'' Hanscom said.
   The last time a Lewiston policeman was killed in the line of
duty was 30 years ago this month.

<TEXT>
   Moslem separatists burned seven rural
schools in the southern province of Narathiwat in an apparent
attempt to disrupt Thailand's general elections on Sunday, a
district official said.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said the rebels
torched the schools and a health clinic in isolated areas of three
districts in the province after midnight Saturday.
   Polling booths had been set up in some of the schools and the
official linked the raids to efforts by Moslems to disrupt the
voting that began at 8 a.m. (9 p.m. EDT).
   A total of 3,606 candidates from 16 parties are vying for 357
seats in the House of Representatives. Since no party is expected
to gain a majority, several parties will probably team up to choose
a prime minister, who then forms a government.
   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, who does not belong to any
party, is widely predicted to return to his post, heading a
coalition of several parties. He has held office since 1980.
   The district official, contacted by telephone, said four of the
schools burned to the ground while three others and the clinic were
damaged. But he said polling at the schools was able to proceed
despite the nighttime raid.
   Moslems, who form a minority in Thailand, are the majority in
the province bordering Malaysia. The country as a whole is
predominantly Buddhist.
   Several hundred Moslem separatists, believed to be supported by
radical groups in the Middle East, operate in the Thai-Malaysian
border area. The separatists have called for a merger with Malaysia
or various forms of autonomy.
   Prem called the election 24 months early after he dissolved
parliament April 29, disbanding his faction-ridden coalition
government.
   The 67-year-old former army commander voted in the provincial
capital of Korat northeast of Bangkok. But he has not said whether
he would accept another term.
   Thai elections are largely centered on personalities, not
political platforms, and the main contention has been whether Prem
should return or not.
   Although his popularity has been waning, most leaders of the
four current coalition parties back his return. And he remains
favored by three institutions which figure in the choice of a prime
minister: the military, bureaucracy and constitutional monarchy.
   Whoever emerges as the new prime minister is almost certainly to
keep Thailand on the same general course of economically
conservative, politically pro-Western policies. The economy has
boomed in the past two years.
   The present coalition government comprises the Democrat Party of
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul; the Chart Thai (Thai
Nation) of Deputy Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan; the Social
Action Party of Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila, and the
Rassadorn (Citizens) Party of Deputy Prime Minister Thienchai
Sirisamphan.

<HEAD>Iranian Diplomat Calls On U.N. Head To Halt Iraqi Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's foreign minister said Sunday that
Iraqi raids into Iran were a violation of a U.N. resolution calling
for an end to the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati called on U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to take ``timely and
preventive action'' to halt the incursions, Tehran radio reported.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Velayati left
Tehran for the United Nations on Sunday for the cease-fire talks.
   Iran said Saturday that Iraqi troops backed by tanks, warplanes
and chemical weapons thrust nearly 40 miles into Iran.
   Iraq said its aim was to capture a large number of prisoners
before the opening of cease-fire talks in New York this week. It
claimed it did not plan to keep Iranian territory and the Iraqi
News Agency reported Saturday that Iraqi forces began withdrawing
from the newly captured territory.
   Tehran radio reported earlier that Velayatiati had sent a letter
to Perez de Cuellar charging that renewed Iraqi aggression
threatened action on a cease-fire.
   ``Does the first article of the resolution not state that one of
the first steps towards reaching a solution is that of observing a
cease-fire and halting all military operations? However, Iraq has
not only not observed a cease-fire but has been conducting new acts
of aggression by occupying Iranian territory and has blatantly
violated this article,'' Tehran radio quoted Velayati's letter as
saying.
   A U.N. technical team planned to arrive in Tehran on Sunday to
begin working out details of a cease-fire.
   Iran announced on Monday that it was accepting the resolution,
adopted by the Security Council one year ago and previously
endorsed by Iran.

   Two fires broke out at the Madagascan Embassy
early Sunday.
   Lt. Ransom Washington, spokesman for the District of Columbia
Fire Department, said officials were investigating a fire that
occurred at 2:17 a.m. EDT and a second fire that erupted about two
hours later.
   ``I smelled the smoke of the fire, so I decided to awaken my
family,'' said Leon M. Rajaobelina, the ambassador from Madagascar.
``We called immediately the Secret Service and within a minute they
were there, and the fire department was there within five minutes.''
   Battalion Chief Dennis Boatman, who was at the scene of the
first fire, said firefighters worked for about 10 minutes to bring
the blaze under control.
   Fire officials told the ambassador and his staff that the blaze
started in the reception area of the building. Jocelyn
Rafidinarivo, the embassy's counselor for public affairs, said the
fire may have been started by a lit cigarette.
   The fire department spokesman said he did not know if the second
fire occurred in the same room.
   No injuries were reported in either fire. Damage estimates were
not available.

<HEAD>Exhibition Offers Intimate Look at Canada's Eccentric Musical
Genius</HEAD>

   He wore a wool scarf and gloves in summer and
lived like a hermit, communicating with the outside world mostly by
telephone.
   But when Glenn Gould died of a stroke nine days after his 50th
birthday in 1982, Canada lost not only a notorious eccentric but
one of its greatest musicians.
   For the first time since the pianist's death, an exhibition at
the National Library in Ottawa provides an intimate look at Gould's
life, from his checkered cloth cap to the room keys he collected at
hotels across the continent, including an entire set from New
York's Stanhope Hotel.
   Fortunately for posterity, Gould was a pack rat who set aside
one room of his apartment on Toronto's West St. Clair Avenue for
scores, scripts, letters, programs, souvenirs and assorted junk.
   ``He wrote everything down on pads. You can almost follow him
through each day,'' said Stephen Willis, head of the library's
music manuscript collection. The exhibit runs through mid-September.
   A packing list reminds Gould to bring Valium and Librium for his
nerves, and a TV Guide. A 1966 commentary for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. says in red ball point, ``Sometimes it seems to
me that Mozart has had a rather better press than he deserves.''
   A letter from his grandmother recommends a mustard pack for his
sore back, and Gould commiserates with an ailing Leonard Bernstein
(``Dear Leonardo'') by offering some tips on hypochondria. ``I have
several titles for diseases which I am expecting to have in later
life but have not yet had occasion to make use of.''
   After a piano technician dislocated Gould's shoulder with a
backslap, the pianist distributed a notice requesting that no one
offer to shake his hand. ``This will eliminate embarrassment all
around,'' it said.
   A Canadian celebrity at 15, Gould's international career had a
sensational start. He landed a lucrative Columbia Records contract
the day after his New York debut in 1955, and the first of more
than 100 discs, Bach's Goldberg Variations, is still rated a
classic.
   He suddenly abandoned the concert platform in 1964 in pursuit of
what he saw as a purer musical experience in the recording studio.
He eventually became his own producer, controlling a mixing board
the way a conductor directs an orchestra.
   He loved the microphone and dedicated much of his time to radio
and TV documentaries.
   A night owl, Gould rented a studio at Toronto's Inn on the Park
because it was the only place in town he could get something to eat
in the early hours, Willis said.
   The exhibit features Gould's favorite Steinway, his cluttered
pigeon-hole desk and the rickety card-table chair his father
modified as a piano stool. Gould preferred a low-slung chair so
that his fingers lay flat along the keyboard, the antithesis of the
pounding romantic style he abhorred.
   An animal lover, Gould left his worldly goods to the Toronto
Humane Society and the Salvation Army. The library was allowed to
purchase the collection of 20,000 items, packed in 226 boxes, on
condition it organize an exhibit. The display tours the rest of
Canada later this year, and negotiations are under way with U.S.
and European museums.
   The most personal documents were withheld, but Willis said there
was evidence of ``two or three relationships'' with women that did
not last long.
   In retrospect, Gould's career is filled with irony. He searched
for musical clarity and control in what he termed the ``backbone''
of a score and dismissed virtuoso playing and tonal beauty for its
own sake.
   However, he marred some recordings by humming along with the
music, a habit critics considered an affectation. ``Readers will
find the groans and croons intolerable,'' the Penguin Guide says of
one Bach recording.
   Gould preferred the piano to the harpsichord and played no part
in the rediscovery of original instruments and pitch that has
revolutionized baroque listening in the 1980s.
   He saw nothing wrong with splicing dozens of takes for one
definitive performance and envisioned an era when recordings,
adjusted electronically by home listeners, would entirely replace
public concerts.
   Gould holds an Olympian place in Canadian music.
   ``As a cultural symbol, he grows in stature every year, both as
a true Canadian original and as a certified hero of modernist
performers,'' said Robert Everett-Green, music critic for The Globe
and Mail.

   A strong earthquake shook desolate Mongolia and
sent shocks across the border into China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, the official Xinhua News Agency said Sunday.
   Chinese seismological stations said the quake occurred at 4:38
p.m. Saturday and measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, signifying a
tremor capable of causing severe damage in populated areas.
   Xinhua did not say if there were any reports of damage. It said
the quake was centered in far western Mongolia near where the
Soviet Union, Mongolia and China meet. It is a desolate and
sparsely inhabited region.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.

   Fire broke out in Manila's most
exclusive department store and burned through the night, but
firefighters were able to contain it and there were no reports of
injuries, authorities said Sunday.
   Francisco Adriano, a firefighter, said the blaze broke out
Saturday night on the third floor of the seven-story Rustan's, in
the Makati Commercial Center.
   He said it burned more than 15 hours and that firefighters had
trouble extinquishing the flames because of the building's poor
ventilation.
   It was the second blaze to hit a major store in the Makati
commercial complex. In May, a fire that lasted for several days
razed the Makati branch of Shoemart, the Philippines' biggest
department store chain.

   About 20,000 people formed a human chain
around the U.S. Navy air station in Atsugi on Sunday to protest
noisy night landings at the base.
   Three times during the peaceful, 40-minute protest the
demonstrators joined hands for about five minutes around the
10-mile perimeter of the base.
   Participants shouted ``Give us a quiet night!''
   There was no immediate reaction to the demonstration by American
authorities at the base.
   U.S. Navy pilots use Atsugi, 25 miles southwest of Tokyo, to
practice night landings, leading to frequent protests about jet
noise from residents of the densely populated area.
   Sunday's demonstration was sponsored by the Japan Socialist
Party, the country's largest opposition party, and by the labor
federation Sohyo and civic and religious groups.
   The mood was festive, and police reported no violence or arrests.
   Organizers said 27,750 people took part in the demonstration,
but police estimated the number at 19,000. Tadashi Abe, one of the
organizers, said more people showed up than expected.
   Noise from the landings has gone beyond ``permissible levels,''
Abe said, ``mainly because the base has increased its force.''
   The United States maintains military bases in Japan under the
U.S.-Japan security treaty.
   Last summer, 25,000 people formed an 11-mile human chain around
Kadena Air Base in Okinawa to protest the presence of U.S. military
bases.

<HEAD>Olympic National Park Celebrates 50th Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vigilance is needed if the beauty of
Olympic National Park is to be preserved, the director of the
National Park Service said at the park's 50th birthday party.
   ``There are those who suggest that having already established
the park lands, their preservation is assured, and there is little
more to be done with them, for them, to provide for this adequate
protection and maintenance,'' William Penn Mott said Saturday.
   But there's ``much to be done if these places are to fulfill
their heritage,'' he warned the more than 500 people at Saturday's
ceremonies.
   Mott noted that more than 300 million people annually visit the
nation's parks, compared with 16 million visitors in 1938.
   ``Our park system continues to grow. And we need to continue to
grow,'' to preserve such outdoor areas for future generations, he
said.
   President Franklin Delano Roosevelt voiced those same sentiments
before signing the legislation, sponsored by local Congressman Mon
Wallgren, that created the park five decades ago.
   ``I think you can count on my help in getting that national
park, not only because we need it for us old people and you young
people, but for a whole lot of young people who are going to come
along in the next hundred years of America,'' Roosevelt told Port
Angeles residents in 1937.
   On June 29, 1938, Roosevelt signed a bill setting aside 634,000
acres to be preserved as Olympic National Park.
   Today, the park is 922,000 acres of glacier-capped mountains,
alpine meadows, temperate rain forest and ocean coastline. The
nation's third-most-visited national park, with more than 3 million
a year, Olympic remains one of the wildest.
   The non-profit National Parks and Conservation Association, as
part of a nationwide assessment of land-acquisition needs, has
proposed about 180,000 acres be added to further protect important
watersheds and habitat.
   A study of ways to maintain national parks' integrity into the
21st century is under way by a task force of Park Service managers,
Mott said. Entrance fees, such as those which were imposed last
year at Olympic National Park, help provide such research funds,
along with local resource management, he added.
   Along with preserving the parks, officials also need ``to
continue to explore the cultural and recreational interests of
special populations, minorities and international visitors to
ensure that the parks are truly available for the benefit and
enjoyment of all,'' Mott said.
   Other issues to be addressed include protection of endangered
species, air and water pollution and encroaching development
outside the parks, Mott said.
   He also called for ``improved cooperation among adjacent land
owners and land management agencies'' outside the park, as well as
the academic and scientific communities' expanded involvement with
park affairs.

<HEAD>New Orleans Struggles To Meet Financial Obligations For Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hosting the Republican National Convention
will cost the city of New Orleans roughly $5.5 million in cash, and
the effort to raise that money through donations apparently will go
right down to the wire.
   ``We've raised $4.2 million as of last Tuesday,'' said Ron
Jones, president of the Louisiana Coca-Cola Bottling Co. and head
of the fund drive.
   ``That puts us pretty much on target. Maybe a little behind,''
he added. ``We wanted to finish up Aug. 1 _ I think we're more
likely to finish up that first or second week of August.''
   The convention begins the third week of August, running Aug.
15-18 in the Louisiana Superdome.
   Raising money in a city still beset by hard economic times
hasn't been easy, Jones concedes. But he insists the money is being
scraped together with a minimum of arm-twisting.
   ``In a community like New Orleans,'' said Jones, ``the private
sector and individuals in the community are prepared to come to the
table to help out the city.''
   Without question, the city needed help. Reeling from 10 percent
unemployment and declining tax revenue, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy and
the city council tirelessly pursued the GOP in 1986, luring the
party to the Louisiana Superdome with the promise of $8 million in
financial support for the convention.
   Barthelemy and company are banking on the convention being a
huge economic boon to the community, not only because of it will
spur a projected $137 million in spending, but also because all the
publicity could attract new business.
   ``The $8 million was both in cash and in kind,'' said Kurt
Steiner, Barthelemy's chief administrative officer.
   ``In kind'' contributions, with an estimated value of $2.5
million to $3 million, included use of the city's parks, a
performing arts theatre, the municipal auditorium and other places
for meetings, office space and entertainment.
   Cash contributions, Steiner said, include money for a new
million-dollar light system and a half-million-dollar sound system
to be used by the Republicans in the Superdome.
   Security, including overtime for police, will eat up a lot of
the money, Steiner said, along witth the cost of building stages,
media platforms, seats and a raised ``false floor'' to hide cables.
There's also a computer system for the convention staff, and
insurance.
   The city's prospects for coming up with the money looked dim for
a time earlier this year. The Greater New Orleans Convention Fund,
headed by oil millionaire Pat Taylor, was struggling. After raising
about $2 million in contributions, Taylor publicly complained in
May that donations were lagging.
   That prompted the Barthelemy administration to appoint a new
committee, the New Orleans Special Events Fund, headed by Jones,
Mervin Trail, president of the Greater New Orleans Tourist and
Convention Commission, and by Jim Bob Moffett, president of
Freeport-McMoRan Corporation and chairman of the local Chamber of
Comerce.
   Still assisted by Taylor's group, the special events fund took
an aggressive, more focused approach, zeroing in on individual
chamber members, the tourist and hotel industry and major
corporations.
   So far, Jones said, the tactic has worked, netting contributions
ranging from $150 from small businesses to more than $200,000 from
major corporations. The city has so far been able to meet
contractural obligations arising from construction in the dome and
Republican convention officials said last week preparations for the
convention were progressing on schedule.

<TEXT>
   A grisly cycle of murders and
reprisal killings by leftists and rightists is raising fears of a
breakdown in law and order and threatening efforts to promote
democracy and protect human rights.
   ``Hardly a day passes without a murder or more being headlined
in our newspapers,'' the Catholic Bishops Conference of the
Philippines said in a recent statement.
   ``Our sensibilities are being battered day in and day out, with
reportage of killings and ambuscades, of slaughter and violence _
acts of terrorism all,'' the bishops said.
   According to the military's Capital Regional Command, at least
65 people, most of them police, soldiers and anti-communist
civilians, were slain in the Manila area by the rebel New People's
Army in the first six months of the year.
   Those attacks have led to formation of right-wing ``death
squads,'' which methodically target trade unionists, leftists and
social activists in an apparent bid to undercut their influence in
politics.
   Victims of the rightists include at least five Filipino human
rights lawyers. A prominent leftist university president, Nemesio
Prudente, has been wounded twice in two assassination attempts in
the past seven months.
   The violence is not limited to Manila. Nearly 40 people have
been slain this year in politically motivated violence in Angeles,
home of the U.S.-run Clark Air Base 50 miles north of Manila.
   Similar killings have been reported in Cebu, Bacolod and other
major cities.
   Several regional officials of the pro-government New Patriotic
Alliance have dropped out of the organization in fear since the
group's national chairman, Lean Alejandro, was slain last
September. The murder was not solved.
   Alejandro's group was among the social activist organizations
that rallied behind Corazon Aquino in the February 1986 revolt that
toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino, who became president on the promise of restoring
democracy and human rights, has called for an end to the violence.
She warns that the unbridled killings will erode public confidence
in her government.
   But Mrs. Aquino's pledge to restore democracy has not been
enough to quell the 19-year Communist insurgency, which expanded
during the 20-year rule of her ousted predecessor.
   The killings underscore Mrs. Aquino's fragile control of the
police and armed forces. Military dissidents were responsible for a
series of coup attempts that rocked the Aquino government, and
leftists claim police and soldiers have been behind many of the
right-wing killings.
   Those arrested in a June 30 attack on Prudente include five
Manila policemen and a member of a government-backed anti-communist
vigilante group organized by police.
   Prudente, who was jailed under Marcos for alleged ties to a
leftist assassination team, had been accused by police of harboring
communists at his Polytechnic University of the Philippines.
   ``Their interpretation of democracy is some kind of police
state,'' Prudente said of his attackers. ``It's no different from
the communist society that they have been castigating.''
   ``We are one of those victims caught in the cross fire between
the extreme left and the extreme right,'' he was quoted as saying
by the Sunday Inquirer Magazine.
   Inability to curb the violence also threatens to undermine
public support for the policy of all-out war against the
communists, which Mrs. Aquino unveiled after peace talks with the
rebels collapsed in January 1987.
   Liberal Filipinos have begun to complain that the ``total war''
campaign is polarizing society and encouraging violence not only
against doctrinaire Marxists but also against those campaigning
legally for social and economic reform.
   ``The human rights issue calls for an urgent reassessment of the
counterinsurgency policy that has forced the government to trade
its humanist soul in exchange for short-term political stability
provided by support of the Armed Forces,'' wrote prominent
columnist Amando Doronila in The Manila Chronicle.
   Earlier this year, the rebels claimed they would scale down
assassinations because of the alarm the killings generated among
the urban middle class, which the communists hope to recruit to
their cause.
   But last week, Arnel Sandoval, spokesman of the rebel Alex
Boncayao Brigade, said killings would continue as long as the
Aquino government fails to curb the rightists.
   ``As the Aquino government continues to protect and refuse to
punish criminals in uniform, so shall the ABB resolve the bring
these people the revolutionary justice they deserve,'' he said.

<HEAD>Coal Burner Could Curtail Hospital Waste Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospitals grappling with mounting infectious
waste may soon get help from an unlikely source: the Department of
Energy's coal research program.
   A specialized boiler could solve problems associated with
disposing of surgical gloves, gowns, syringes and needles _ and at
the same time, boost coal production by as much as 5 million tons
per year, DOE said.
   Department officials said in interviews last week that DOE has
entered a cost-sharing agreement with Good Samaritan Hospital of
Lebanon, Pa., for a demonstration project involving the boiler.
   An early stumbling block could be cost. A boiler of the size
needed for a large hospital may not yet be economical, although the
government believes research will ultimately lower the cost, said
DOE spokesman Robert C. Porter.
   The problem of medical waste disposal has been graphically
demonstrated this summer by the needles, syringes and other debris
washing up on beaches in New York, New Jersey and other states.
Some beaches have been closed, and the source of the pollution has
not yet been found.
   ``Applying clean-burning coal technology to hospital waste
disposal is a possible `spin-off' of our program that could not
have come at a better time,'' said J. Allen Wampler, assistant
energy secretary for fossil energy.
   ``Hospitals are struggling with the problem of growing amounts
of infectious waste, and it translates directly into a dollars and
cents issue. The expense of discarding this material is increasing
the costs of medical care.''
   The experimental coal-burning device is called a ``fluidized bed
boiler.'' As envisioned by DOE, it would enable hospitals to burn
waste while producing energy for heat or steam at the hospital.
Widespead use of the boiler could create a market for as much as 3
million to 5 million tons of additional coal production a year, the
department said.
   But the main objective of the experiment is for hospitals to
efficiently dispose of infectious materials and avoid burdensome
hauling costs. Large hospitals, particularly those treating AIDS
patients, can pay up to $300,000 per year to transport waste to
incinerators or other disposal facilities.
   The boiler is part of an effort by the federal government and
private industry in the last 10 years to develop new ways of
burning coal without harming the environment.
   Most conventional boilers burn coal rapidly at a temperature of
up to 3,000 degrees. In a fluidized bed boiler, the coal burns more
slowly at a lower temperature, giving it time to interact with
limestone, which acts as a sponge to absorb pollutants.
   ``It's at about 1,600 degrees, which is almost ideal for
disposing of the waste material in hospitals,'' Porter said.
``That's the temperature at which the toxins break down or are
destroyed.''
   The boiler has been used commercially to produce energy, but has
not been tried as an incinerator for medical wastes, according to
Kenneth Markel Jr. of DOE's Energy Technology Center in Morgantown,
W.Va.
   While coal is among the least expensive of fuels, the boiler can
also run on other materials such as wood chips or rubber tires.
   DOE said it has already paid $93,000 to help design the one-year
project, whose total cost of $961,800 is to be shared by the
department, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and York-Shipley of
York, Pa., which is one of the contractors.

   The Army Corps of Engineers' efforts to
tame the Mississippi are enabling barge traffic to scrape along in
spite of this summer's record low water and the river's natural
tendencies, Corps officials say.
   ``What the river wants to do is wiggle back and forth. What
we're trying to do is stabilize the channel,'' said Mike Robinson,
a historian with the Corps in Vicksburg, Miss.
   Strangled by a lack of rain, the Mississippi has dropped to more
than 20 feet below normal at Memphis and sand buildups have caused
traffic jams involving hundreds of barges.
   The Mississippi's flow is expected to fall to 20 percent of
normal at Memphis before the drought is over, and towboat operators
say they'll lose more than $60 million this summer because of
reduced traffic.
   On July 10, the Mississippi registered a record low of 10.7 feet
below zero on the river gauge at Memphis and the flow of water
rushing past the city was 115,000 cubic feet per second. Zero is an
arbitrary mark set at 183.91 feet above sea level.
   At what the Corps calls ``full bank,'' the flow at Memphis is
1.3 million cfs and the river measures 34 feet above zero. The
normal flow for July is 411,000 cfs.
   The record low flow of 78,000 cfs was set in 1936 when the river
measured zero on the Memphis gauge. Since then, the main channel
has been made narrower and deeper.
   In the old days when the river was left to wander, the
Mississippi often split into two or more channels and formed big
winding loops.
   In the 1930s and '40s, the Corps of Engineers cut off 16 of
those loops to straighten the channel and shortened the Lower
Mississippi by 150 miles.
   This year's low water has revealed stone dikes and huge concrete
slabs that Corps officials say are more critical than ever to
keeping the river open to barges.
   The dikes, sticking out into the water like long, skinny
fingers, force the Mississippi's main channel toward the middle of
the riverbed, while mile upon mile of concrete revetment _ a
blanket of concrete slabs _ keeps the river from forming loops by
eroding into the bank.
   The river can be more than a mile across from bank to bank, but
its main channel is often only 500 to 600 feet wide. The drought
has cut that to less than 200 feet in some areas.
   Narrowing the river and preventing it from flowing slowly around
a series of bends causes the main channel to dig itself deeper. In
spite of record lows, the Lower Mississippi remains 25 to 40 feet
deep in some places.
   But towboats are running into trouble at the so-called
``crossings'' where the river channel winds back and forth across
the riverbed. The current slackens and sand and sediment settle
out, sometimes putting the river at less than nine feet deep, the
minimum generally needed for barges and towboats.
   The Corps has identified more than 30 troublesome crossings
where dredging will likely be needed this summer between
Caruthersville, Mo., and Greenville, Miss.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev moved away from quiet
diplomacy and got tough last week as he sought to resolve a dispute
over an obscure mountain region whose importance has grown far
beyond its contested borders.
   The Soviet leader's handling of the problem offers some insight
into how far he is prepared to go in allowing more openness and
giving people a greater say in how they are governed.
   Gorbachev said the struggle over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly
Armenian enclave in the republic of Azerbaijan, has inflicted
immense damage on perestroika, his reform program. He warned it
could doom his plans to modernize Soviet society.
   Addressing the Soviet leadership Monday at a special session of
the Supreme Soviet's Presidium, Gorbachev said: ``If we fail to
find the solution to this question today _ and we must find it _
this would have far-reaching consequences and would affect all
perestroika.''
   The immediate issue is the future of the sparsely populated,
largely undeveloped region in the Caucasus Mountains. The ethnic
Armenian majority set out in February to secede from largely Moslem
Azerbaijan and join predominantly Christian Armenia.
   But in the Soviet Union, a patchwork quilt of 15 republics
shared by more than 100 distinct ethnic and national groups,
redrawing maps is a dangerous business.
   Gorbachev and the Presidium, the top executive body of
government, served notice they were not about to open that
Pandora's box.
   Clearly, Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, is not a
guarantee of free speech as practiced in Western democracies, and
democratization does not sanction a challenge to one-party rule.
   The government has tolerated massive demonstrations _ including
some in the Armenian capital of Yerevan that have drawn hundreds of
thousands, perhaps even a million people, according to witness
accounts. But Gorbachev said redrawing the borders would constitute
an abuse of democratization ``fundamentally at variance with the
aims of perestroika.''
   Giving in to nationalist demands, he told the Presidium, would
``poison public mentality with nationalist venom and thereby spoil
relations between the peoples for many, many years to come.''
   In unanimously rejecting Nagorno-Karabakh's attempt to secede
against Azerbaijan, the Presidium warned that a series of strikes
that began in Nagorno-Karabakh and spread to Armenia, crippling the
local economy, had exhausted the Presidium's patience.
   The Kremlin authorized police to ``take essential measures'' to
end the strikes and ``activities directed at kindling national
strife and attempts to misuse democratic rights for anti-democratic
purposes.''
   Troops stationed in the strife-torn areas were reinforced.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan, a leader of the annexation drive who was
arrested in March on a charge of defaming the state, was stripped
of his Soviet citizenship and ordered expelled from the country.
   The state-run national press attacked strike leaders by name.
   First indications showed the new tough tactics were having an
impact. Most workers in Armenia returned to their jobs, although
the general strike continued in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The central leadership clearly has acted with more restraint and
tolerance than would have been expected in previous Soviet regimes.
Not long ago, the Kremlin would have quickly turned to force to put
down the turmoil.
   This time, the Kremlin first tried the power of persuasion.
Gorbachev made a personal appeal Feb. 26 for ``civic maturity and
restraint,'' and the mass demonstrations in Yerevan subsided. But
two days later, a riot broke out in the Azerbaijani city of
Sumgait, and at least 32 people were killed, 26 of them Armenians.
   The Kremlin also tried changing the local leadership, installing
new party chiefs in Armenia and Azerbaijan. The new officials
quickly acknowledged that Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh had been
deprived culturally and socially under previous regimes.
   In March, the central government announced a major remedial
program to improve cultural and social conditions in
Nagorno-Karabakh, with much of the aid going to the Armenian
majority.
   But Armenians outside the region, perhaps encouraged by the new
latitude given them by glasnost, made annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh a crusade. Those who died in Sumgait were its
martyrs.
   The legislatures of both Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenian
republic sought the annexation, claiming the right of
self-determination guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution. But
Azerbaijan, citing another constitutional provision requiring
consent of affected republics before redrawing boundaries, rejected
the appeals.
   That set the stage for intervention by the central government.
   ``Democratic rights and the new conditions opened up and created
by perestroika are being clearly misused for anti-democratic
purposes,'' Gorbachev told the Presidium. Both sides, he said, were
using territorial claims to stir up national sentiments and
``conceal the really difficult, crying problems that had
accumulated.''
   Victory can only come by finding a common course, Gorbachev
said, adding that the search for that course must continue.

<HEAD>New Corn Plant Could Help Third World</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CARL HARTMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new plant that could turn corn into a health
food and help nourish protein-starved children in the Third World
is being promoted by the U.S. government's National Research
Council.
   It's called QPM for quality-protein maize because it contains
about twice the usable protein of ordinary varieties. Maize is the
international word for corn.
   A small research team, working for 10 years, developed QPM at
the same laboratories where Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman E.
Borlaug produced the new wheat varieties that brought the ``green
revolution'' in the 1950s.
   Noel Vietmeyer, an expert on useful but neglected plants for the
research council, calls Borlaug, 74, the ``spiritual godfather'' of
QPM, although he was not directly involved in the project at the
International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat near
Mexico City. Borlaug still works at the center.
   ``Maize is often the crop of the poor, and in the maize-growing
areas of the world, millions of children living in poverty are not
thriving,'' says the newly published report of a panel appointed by
the council.
   ``Here is an opportunity to explore this new approach to
relieving an intolerable situation,'' it says.
   The world produces enough corn to provide each inhabitant with
about 200 pounds a year. It is a staple food for nearly half the
world's chronically undernourished people.
   ``A typical diet might consist of 20 or more tortillas a day,
supplemented with hot peppers, some native greens, and little or
nothing else,'' says the council's monthly ``News Report'' for July.
   Tortillas are generally made in Latin America with corn meal.
   People in wealthier countries get their protein from meat, fish,
cheese and a variety of other foods. Small children get it from
milk. Tens of millions of poor people in the Third World survive on
corn, cassava, yams, plantain and other foods low in protein.
   When small children are weaned in those countries, they cannot
eat enough of the beans or rice to provide the protein milk has
given them, and millions suffer from kwashiorkor, a
protein-deficiency disease that stunts growth.
   The report suggests distributing QPM in areas that already
depend heavily on corn to feed small children: the highlands of the
Andes mountains in South America, Central America, most of Africa,
Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines.
   It sees QPM as also having important advantages for industrial
countries.
   ``There is, for instance, distinct promise for breakfast cereals
and snack foods, both of which are constantly criticized for their
low nutritional value,'' it says.
   The new maize variety is not yet ready for use in the United
States, It was created with the Third World in mind and its pollen
is spread naturally by the wind. In the United States, farmers use
hybrid seeds produced in greenhouses or on special plots of land,
so that the seeds always breed true.
   One of the problems with QPM is that it looks and tastes like
ordinary corn, and so do the gruels, cakes and tortillas made from
it. This makes it more palatable than some earlier varieties but
there is a danger that a field of QPM might interbreed with a field
of ordinary maize and the QPM would soon lose its special quality.
   The report says that for this reason it will be especially
important to introduce QPM in an organized way.

   Vivian Filemyr's health is frail and money is
tight, so when the government suddenly slashed her share of her
ex-husband's military pension, she had to plead with doctors and
creditors to accept less than usual when bills came due.
   The 66-year-old Austin woman says her main source of income was
cut without warning in May, from about $1,100 a month to $900, and
she's spent the last two months trying to find out why.
   She thinks the cut came because her es-husband, a retired
colonel, may have incurred a debt to the government many years
after their 1972 divorce.
   The military won't say more, she said, because it would be an
invasion of his privacy.
   ``My credit rating is being hurt; I have to call my creditors
and say my check is reduced and I don't know why and I can't pay
you,'' Ms. Filemyr said.
   Congressional officials and members of an ex-wives support group
in Alexandria, Va., say Ms. Filemyr's case is not unique and may
illustrate a growing trend as the government cracks down on its bad
debts.
   ``The government _ they'll get their money any way they can,''
said Shirley Taft, former president of EX-POSE, or Ex-Partners of
Servicemen-women for Equality.
   ``We've heard from quite a few (women) and it's quite
devastating. They don't even know why it's being reduced and the
finance centers won't tell them. They only know the man's gone into
debt for something,'' Ms. Taft said.
   She said representatives of the group met with Pentagon
officials earlier this month to argue that the ex-wives should not
be held liable for debts incurred by their former spouses after the
divorce is final.
   But the Pentagon told the group ``chances of an administrative
change are very slim,'' she said.
   Congressional hearings on the matter and other related issues
are planned in September before a subcommittee of the House Armed
Services Committee, says a spokeswoman for Rep. Pat Schroeder,
D-Colo., who sponsored the 1982 Former Spouse Protection Act.
   Under the bill, courts can award a portion of a serviceman's
retirement check to the former spouse. If the couple were married
at least 10 years, the ex-wife can receive the money directly
through the military's finance centers, Ms. Taft said.
   Maj. David Super, Pentagon spokesman, said the military is
looking into the situation but continues to ``operate with existing
administrative rules and laws.''
   Ms. Taft said her organization plans to poll its 3,500 members
about the problem this month.
   ``This is not an isolated case,'' Ms. Filemyr wrote in a letter
to Rep. Jake Pickle, D-Texas. ``I have spoken with various women
across the country who have related to me that they are in the same
situation.''
   Mrs. Filemyr said she was divorced after 25 years of marriage
and was on welfare for years as she fought for the 1982 law.
   ``I only had a little job here, a little job there, and I kept
getting sicker,'' she said. ``I've had it rough, yes I've had it
rough. Her only other source of income is a monthly Social Security
check of about $160, she said.
   Rep. Schroeder's spokeswoman said the congresswoman plans to
introduce legislation that would divide retirement pay according to
a formula based on the number of years of service and the length of
the marriage, rather than leaving the decision to individual courts
or states.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Confident Of Vote-Getting Strength For Dukakis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Booe, graf 7, cq</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>

   Bolstered by their highest delegate strength ever
at a Democratic convention, union leaders believe they can deliver
2.5 million votes for Michael Dukakis in November.
   Although the AFL-CIO will not officially endorse Dukakis until
Aug. 24, after the Republican convention, its political operatives
left here with no intention of waiting for what one called the
``pro forma announcement'' to begin working on Dukakis' behalf.
   An $8 million voter registration campaign _ put on a back burner
while unions concentrated on collecting convention delegates in the
primaries and caucuses _ is being reignited this week.
   After breakfasting with Dukakis last week, AFL-CIO President
Lane Kirkland said in an interview that unions will have less
difficulty than they did four years ago in getting their members to
vote a Democratic ticket.
   ``In 1984 there was a swell of support in favor of Reagan,'' he
said. ``We stemmed that tide better than the others. This year
there is an entirely different set of circumstances. There's no
incumbency and people want a change.''
   Despite the union label on 1,054 or more than one-fourth of the
Democratic convention delegates, labor still is maintaining a lower
profile in comparison with its all-out boosterism of Walter Mondale
four years ago.
   ``We worked harder in 1984 and all we got for it was fewer
delegates and more abuse,'' said James Booe, secretary-treasurer of
the Communications Workers of America.
   It was two of labor's more consistent supporters in the Senate _
John Glenn of Ohio and Gary Hart of Colorado _ who cried ``special
interest'' after the AFL-CIO endorsed Mondale in October 1983. That
was four months before the first Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire
primary.
   Kirkland takes satisfaction that both Hart and Glenn ``went down
the chute'' afterwards and that no candidate for national office
has repeated what he views as a slur since. But the scar is still
there.
   To provide Dukakis with a winning margin, labor leaders believe
they will have to get at least a 65 percent vote for him from a
rank-and-file membership that cast 39 percent of its votes four
years ago for Ronald Reagan.
   ``There is a mythology that it was the blue-collar workers that
brought Reagan in,'' said Kirkland. ``Sixty percent of our people
voted for Walter Mondale. But if we have to get two-thirds of our
membership, which encompasses a wide cross-section of the country,
to elect a decent candidate, it tells me there is a strong
conservative bias in the rest of the population.''
   The AFL-CIO plans to have at least 300,000 volunteers working
the polls on Election Day, said John Perkins, director of the
federation's Committee on Political Education. But first it has to
ensure that its members are registered.
   Labor political activists are working on a three-part formula
that could allow unions to provide enough votes to counter the
acknowledged more conservative views of the rest of the electorate.
It calls for:
   _ Voter registration that is 15 percentage points above the
national average of 72 percent. AFL-CIO officials estimate that
about 80 percent of the federation's 14.1 million members are now
registered.
   _ Turnout on election day that is 15 percentage points higher
than the 53 percent of the voting age population that went to the
polls in 1984.
   _ And a vote among union members for the labor-endorsed
candidate that is at least 15 percentage points higher than the
electorate at large gives him. The AFL-CIO achieved that in 1984
with the 61 percent of its membership voting for Mondale, compared
with 41 percent of the total electorate.
   With all three, Kirkland estimates trade union support of a
candidate is worth a net 2.5 million votes nationwide. ``That's not
something to be sneezed at,'' he says with pride.
   According to political directors for individual unions, the
effort faltered last time on making sure members were registered
and getting them to the polls on election day.
   Even though Mondale had an early lock on the labor endorsement,
many believed he could not win and support waned, according to one
labor activist.
   What's different this year is a belief among labor activists
that Bush has so many negatives that a strong union turnout could
provide Dukakis with the edge to beat him.
   ``Our rank and file by a slim margin voted for Reagan,'' said
Loretta Bowen, the Communication Workers' political director. ``But
they've indicated overwhelmingly they will come back to the
Democratic side. If George Bush were a warm individual, the fact he
has been a supporter of Reagan would help him. But our members
think he's arrogant and a snob.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Shows Friendlier Face But US Shows Little Interest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam, once the bitterest of U.S. rivals, is
showing an increasingly benign attitude toward the United States,
raising the possibility of an eventual accommodation.
   For the short term, however, the United States is refusing even
to discuss the differences between the two countries, preferring to
await a total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia before
making overtures of its own.
   The administration also wants a full accounting from Vietnam of
American servicemen still listed as missing 15 years after the U.S.
pullout from that country. For some time, the U.S.-Vietnamese
dialogue has been limited exclusively to humanitarian issues.
   Meanwhile, Vietnam, is showing a new face to United States in
large and small ways.
   This past week, three U.S. Navy fliers picked up by a Vietnamese
ship in the South China Sea after ditching their plane had nothing
but praise for their rescuers. They were well treated and were
returned quickly to U.S. custody.
   On similar occasions in the past, rescued American servicemen
were confined for months in difficult conditions by Vietnamese
authorities, who sometimes demanded up to $20,000 for their release.
   There are other examples of Hanoi's more forthcoming attitude:
   _A week ago, Vietnam announced that it will allow more than
50,000 persons, many identified with the U.S.-backed Saigon
government that was toppled by Hanoi's forces in 1975, to emigrate
to the United States. Most served time in re-education camps known
for their unhospitable environment.
   _On Monday, U.S. and Vietnamese technical experts will meet in
Hanoi to discuss joint on-site investigations to help resolve the
fate of the nearly 2,400 American servicemen still unaccounted for
from the Vietnam war. The State Department said it was pleased with
Vietnam's promise of a ``concerted effort'' to resolve this issue.
   _Vietnam also has been allowing Vietnamese children fathered by
American servicemen to emigrate with their families to the United
States. A group of 78 left earlier this month, bringing the total
to more than 11,000.
   Still, the Reagan administration has shown no interest in
opening talks on normalizing relations, preferring to keep economic
and diplomatic pressure on Hanoi.
   ``When you have a strategy that's working, you don't abandon it
just when it's beginning to succeed,'' a State Department official
said.
   This official and others, insisting on anonymity, said they
believe that Vietnam is feeling the pressure of a declining economy
and the international isolation it has suffered as a result of its
continued military presence in Cambodia.
   While many other Asian nations are enjoying an economic boom,
partially the result of large-scale exports to the United States,
Vietnam ranks among the world's poorest nations, with no access to
U.S. markets because of a trade embargo.
   At the United Nations, resolutions condemning the Vietnamese
role in Cambodia consistently have been approved by overwhelming
margins. Among major countries, only India has recognized the
pro-Hanoi government which has been in power in Cambodia since 1979.
   Some in Congress, including conservatives, believe the time has
come for the United States to reciprocate the Vietnamese gestures.
On Thursday, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, urged the
administration ``to think seriously about its policy in Vietnam,''
a sentiment shared by Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., have
called on the administration to exchange small diplomatic missions
with Vietnam in Hanoi and Washington. Both are former prisoners of
war in Vietnam.
   All this has fallen on deaf ears in the administration.
   Secretary of State George Shultz said last week the United
States will ``unequivocally welcome'' normal relations with Vietnam
only when there is an acceptable Cambodia settlement and a
satisfactory accounting of the missing American servicmen. He said
the U.S. commitment to these two goals is ``unshakeable.''
   Vietnam seems eager for a pullout from Cambodia, recently
announcing plans to withdraw 50,000 troops this year and agreeing
to take part in preliminary peace talks involving rival Cambodian
factions and other Asian nations. Those talks will start Monday in
Indonesia.
   Cambodia's president, Heng Samrin, said in an interview
published last week that a Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia will
be completed in 1990 even if there is no political solution reached
between the Cambodian government and three rebel groups.

<HEAD>Robertson Says There'll Be No Friction Between His Supporters And
Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ex-Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson says Democrats will be disappointed if they are hoping
for friction at the Republican National Convention between his
supporters and backers of Vice President George Bush.
   ``We got what we wanted,'' Roberson said. ``I like the 1984
platform, and we're in agreement to stick with it.''
   Robertson, who pledged to campaign on Bush's behalf, attended a
Unity '88 Republican rally Saturday in Charleston along with Gov.
Carroll A. Campbell Jr. and Secretary of the Interior Donald Hodel.
   The television evangelist said Democrat Michael Dukakis was the
``most liberal candidate any party has nominated for the
presidency,'' and called the Democratic convention a ``carefully
crafted charade to make liberal Democrats look like moderate
Republicans.''
   Roberston also said there would be no floor fights on platform
issues at the GOP convention next month in New Orleans. However, he
did say he would like a plank calling for the nomination of
conservative candidates at all levels of the federal judiciary.
   ``We want judges who will interpret the Constitution as the law
of the land,'' Robertson said, ``not rewrite the Constitution as
the law of the land.''
   Robertson urged his followers to get behind Bush, predicting
they could provide the margin of victory in as many as 20 closely
contested states.

   Bloodshot eyes, a hoarse voice and a weary
demeanor are hallmarks of Rod Coleman's profession, a result of
working 15 hours or more at a time in the acrid smoke and intense
heat of forest fires.
   Injury or death are possible. The pay is marginal, an average of
about $8 an hour. Except for an occasional good meal, the only
benefit may be a shower after a shift.
   For more than a week now, Coleman has led crews battling the
Mink Creek fire, which by Sunday had blackened 22,650 acres in the
Teton Wilderness of the Bridger-Teton National Forest 40 miles
northeast of Jackson.
   ``It's just so dry,'' incident commander Dale Jarrell said
Friday. ``We just have to have some rain. But our weather people
say there's nothing in the forecast for at least 10 days, and we're
also facing the prospect of some dry lightning strikes in the next
few days.''
   Wind gusting to 35 mph and humidity as low as 11 percent have
exacerbated the dry conditions.
   The main thrust of efforts by firefighters _ as many as 830 but
down to 737 Sunday _ has been to prevent the fire from spreading
south, where it could threaten homes and dude ranches in Buffalo
Valley.
   The firefighters' line across the southern end was holding
Sunday, but the north end had burned about a quarter of a mile into
Yellowstone National Park. Officials said it was in a remote area
more than 30 miles from any major park attractions, but other fires
burned inside the park.
   The southern edge of the huge blaze was about five miles from
Buffalo Valley, but in between is an area of ``blowdown'' trees,
piles of tinder-dry wood left by a tornado last year.
   ``We're holding on at the south end, and every day we do that is
a real positive,'' said Jarrell.
   The lightning-caused blaze broke out July 11 and because it is
in a wilderness area, officials are required by law to allow it to
burn its natural course as much as possible. Such blazes are
usually allowed to burn until they threaten human life or private
property. In the long run, officials say, wildlife benefits.
   With the threat to residents south of the fire, crews have taken
a more active role. However, they are restricted in their digging
and cutting, and the use of bulldozers and mechanical tools such as
chain saws is discouraged. All work must be done by air or on foot;
there is no vehicle access.
   The cost of fighting the blaze was just over $2 million Sunday,
forestry officials said.
   ``Any wilderness fire is more difficult to fight because of its
remoteness,'' said Coleman, who has been fighting fires since 1968.
``The constraints make it even harder.''
   In addition to digging fire lines, crews deployed 20 miles of
hose to draw water from lakes and ponds. They also burned 2,000
acres to create a fire break on the southern edge.
   Coleman, 39, a U.S. Bureau of Land Management range
conservationist from Vale, Ore., said some firefighters have
experienced knee and leg problems because of the steep terrain. But
morale, he said, ``has been fantastic. These teams have a lot of
pride.''
   For the past few days, Coleman has been leader of a group of
Chippewa Indian firefighters from Montana. That crew just arrived
from battling another blaze in Lame Deer, Mont.
   The base camp has facilities for eating, sleeping, caring for
the injured and organizing the firefighting. Officials pore over
maps and infrared photographs of the fire area.
   Health and safety officials monitor fatigue among crews,
shipping some out for a rest and demobilizing others entirely,
bringing in fresh crews to replace them. A fresh crew could expect

<HEAD>Reform Package Would Give Local Schools Autonomy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The school system branded the worst in the nation
could become a trailblazer under a reform package that calls for a
slimmed-down bureaucracy and more neighborhood clout.
   The proposal calls for a council at each of the city's 594
schools to create a three-year improvement plan. If the called-for
changes aren't made, the council may fire the principal. The
councils will consist of 11 members _ parents, teachers, community
residents and the principal.
   Decentralization of power in public schools is a national trend,
but no district has given schools the kind of autonomy outlined in
this package, authorities say.
   ``Even though it's been talked about a few times in the country,
I think if Chicago goes ahead, it will be a unique step,'' said
spokesman Chris Pipho of the Education Commission of the States, a
Denver-based non-profit group that monitors school legislation.
   The reform bill for Chicago's beleaguered schools was approved
by the Legislature this spring and awaits Gov. James R. Thompson's
signature. Thompson must decide by September but has not indicated
which way he's leaning. If he signs, it will take effect next July.
   Critics say the measure focuses too much on administrative
reorganization and too little on programs to help boost performance
of the 430,000 students in the nation's third-largest school
district.
   Even supporters say that if the measure accomplishes all that's
intended, it won't cure deep-seated ills like the growing numbers
of low-income students, a double-digit dropout rate and teen-age
pregnancy.
   ``We'd be kidding ourselves to think that simply doing this is
going to do all those other things that affect learning,'' said
Michael Bakalis, dean of the education school at Loyola University
and the state's former education superintendent.
   But Bakalis, who co-chaired a coalition of community groups that
fought to reform Chicago schools, called the package ``a first
step'' toward eliminating problems that have given the system a
national reputation for mediocrity.
   U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett, who last year labeled
Chicago schools the nation's worst, has not yet studied the package
and is ``inclined not to comment until enough time has passed'' to
assess the results, said a spokesman, Loye Miller.
   The schools' problems stem largely from poorly trained teachers
and administrators ill-equipped to handle the 70 percent of the
student population from poor homes, said Ted Oppenhiemer, executive
director of the pro-reform group Citizens Schools' Committee.
   ``The fact is that children bring many more problems to school
than they used to _ health problems, language deficiencies, just
coming to school without the same kind of nurturing at home that
they had when it was a typical two-parent family situation ...
where children were talked to, where parents were very much
involved,'' he said Friday.
   He said the reform measure will help by permitting speedier
removal of unsatisfactory personnel.
   Also under the bill, a teacher could be dismissed after 45 days
for unsatisfactory performance, Berman said. Teachers now found to
be doing a poor job by the principal and a consulting teacher are
given a year to improve.
   However, the measure does not provide additional money for
retraining teachers or administrators, Oppenheimer noted. ``It's
fine to get rid of lousy teachers. But it's better to retrain ...
and teacher retraining takes money,'' he said.
   The package also would allow principals to hire teachers on
merit, without regard for seniority, reduce administrative spending
and staff at the city Board of Education and create a board to
oversee the changes.
   Many have mixed feelings about the degree of parental
involvement called for in the package.
   ``I don't feel that parents will have the time or the know-how,
nor the interest, to become that involved,'' said Francoise
Friedman, who heads a pro-reform group called Concerned Parents
Network.
   ``I am a very active parent ... and I know how difficult it is
to get parents involved,'' she said.
   The school board and the Chicago Teachers Union have declined to
endorse or reject the proposal.
   ``The entire bill is under review'' by the board's legal
department, said spokesman Robert Saigh.
   John Kotsakis, assistant to Jacqueline Vaughn, the union
president, declined comment. ``We haven't seen the final and actual
language,'' he said.

   Electrical power went out Sunday at a
Detroit airport terminal, forcing Northwest Airlines customers to
retrieve baggage by hand and use stairs to leave and board flights.
   Intermittent power troubles began Saturday and worsened until
the power went completely out Sunday, Northwest spokesman Red Tyler
said from Eagan, Minn., where the airline is headquartered. He said
the airline was operating near its normal schedule from Detroit
Metropolitan Airport.
   The outage knocked out computers and baggage handling belts and
darkened restaurants and shops, Tyler said. He said many telephones
were cut off as well.
   Deputy Dennis Castille of the Wayne County Sheriff's Office
airport division said temporary generators had restored computer
service and some lights by Sunday afternoon, with full service
expected sometime Monday.
   Martin Bufalini, a spokesman for Detroit Edison Co., said the
problem had been traced to a Northwest cable and airline crews were
working on repairs.
   Baggage was being checked at the terminal curb and passengers
were getting on and off planes via stairways, Tyler said. Some
airplanes were using gates at other terminals, he said.

   The newest Kennedy candidate is Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy's youngest son, Patrick, and he's going after a
seat in the Rhode Island Legislature although he's just a
21-year-old college student.
   The 49-year-old Democrat who's held the job for 10 years resents
it, and some key state Democrats say Kennedy is just practicing
before he runs for Congress. He has to be 25 before he can serve
there, however.
   Kennedy, a junior at Providence College, a small, private school
in the state's capital, is challenging Rep. John M. Skeffington Jr.
for a part-time, two-year legislative post.
   ``I'm so surprised,'' said Skeffington, adding that he was an
acquaintance of the Kennedy family. ``I just didn't think they
would come in and run against an incumbent.''
   ``I am not opposed to Patrick Kennedy,'' said City Councilwoman
Carolyn Brassil, the city Democratic chairwoman. ``I just feel that
a student in Rhode Island shouldn't come into the state and run.''
   ``I get the impression that he's using this as a stepping stone
to a congressional seat,'' said Brassil.
   The Democratic primary in September includes a third candidate,
city employee Angelo A. Pitassi. The winner will be unopposed in
the November election because no Republican filed for the seat.
   Skeffington had a difficult primary in 1986 and won renomination
by only 185 votes against a 22-year-old political newcomer. The
district has more than 4,900 registered voters.
   Kennedy said the examples of his uncle, President John F.
Kennedy, and his father, who won his U.S. Senate seat from
Massachusetts in 1962, inspired him to get into politics.
   ``I've been given a name, and I think there's a certain
responsibility that goes hand-in-hand with that name,'' he said.
``It would be easier to sit back and enjoy all the things I've been
given. But I'm going to be spending my summer walking
door-to-door.''
   Skeffington questions the young candidate's commitment to the
neighborhood after he graduates in two years, and calls attention
to his family's wealth.
   ``I know that Pat has said on a radio talk show that he will
spend as much as it takes,'' he said. ``I don't have those kind of
funds. ... I'm going to run on my record.''
   Kennedy spent $12,000 in the March primary to win election as a
Michael Dukakis delegate to last week's Democratic National
Convention.
   Skeffington frequently uses the word ``they,'' meaning the
Kennedy clan, when referring to his opponent, which Kennedy
dislikes.
   ``People have said that the Kennedys have come in to take
over,'' Kennedy said. ``That's no such thing. Patrick Kennedy is
running for state rep.''
   The newest Kennedy candidate faces several obstacles _ his age,
his relatively short residency and his name. He shares an apartment
in a frame house in the Mount Pleasant district a few blocks from
campus.
   He's an outsider in the ethnic, blue-collar neighborhood, and a
wealthy one at that. Despite his wealth, Kennedy says, his
neighbors showered him with cards and expressions of sympathy when
he was hospitalized last spring to have a benign tumor removed from
his back.
   Skeffington runs a funeral home that his grandfather opened
after coming to America from Ireland in 1907.
   ``I am a Mount Pleasanter,'' said Skeffington, who turns 50 on
Aug. 11. ``The people of my district are people like me. ... We're
working-class people. We (politicians) try to do a good job for our
constituents, and I feel I do a good job for them.
   Kennedy said he watched Skeffington while working as a
Statehouse page and legislative researcher his first year at
college.
   ``I saw someone who has had a chance to do more for the
community but hasn't done so,'' Kennedy said. ``I don't think an
incumbent has a divine right to the office he holds just because
he's an incumbent.''
   Patrick Kennedy is the latest of a new generation of Kennedys to
take a shot at politics. His brother, Teddy Jr., and sister, Kara,
are running their father's re-election campaign in Massachusetts.
   His cousin, Joseph P. Kennedy II, son of the late Robert F.
Kennedy, is a congressman from Massachusetts. Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend, the oldest daughter of Robert Kennedy, made an
unsuccessful congressional bid in 1986.

   Iraqi battlefield offensives during U.N.
cease-fire efforts are aimed at strengthening Iraq's position in
peace talks and achieving a permanent solution to complicated
problems, according to officials and diplomats here.
   While Iran announced last week that it would accept a U.N.
Security Council cease-fire resolution, Iraqis say they hope to
forge a lasting peace with their longstanding rival to the east.
   A cease-fire alone might pave the way for further talks, Iraqis
and diplomats say, but it would not solve major and often enduring
disputes between the two sides.
   These include Iran's support of Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq,
Iraq's backing of Iranian rebels along the border, a disputed strip
of land, and arguments over borders and navigation in the Shatt
Al-Arab, Iraq's main outlet to the sea, that date back centuries.
   ``For the international community, the important thing is to
cease hostilities,'' a Western diplomat said. ``For this country,
the important thing is to find peace. These are two completely
different aspects.''
   He said it could take ``months if not years'' to achieve a final
peace settlement.
   ``We don't want a situation where we get into a worse war in a
couple of years,'' a senior Iraqi official told reporters over the
weekend.
   The Iraqi official, who also demanded anonymity, indicated his
country would not rush into any settlement. ``We have lived with it
(war) for eight years. If it takes eight more weeks, no problem,''
he said.
   He said the need for serious peace talks was behind Iraq's
insistence on direct talks with Iran. Iran has balked at the
proposal.
   On the heels of Iran's cease-fire decision, Iraq launched
sizeable offensives that it said drove the last remaining Iranian
forces from its territory. It pushed several miles into Iran.
   Iraq announced that more than 8,500 Iranians were taken captive.
   A military communique, which Iraq said was drafted by President
Saddam Hussein, said the attacks were aimed at paving the way for
peace by reclaiming all Iraqi territory and taking captives,
apparently to even the numbers that will have to be exchanged after
the war.
   Communiques also said the attacks were aimed at smashing Iran's
already reeling war machine. Despite Iranian claims the Iraqi
invasion reached nearly 40 miles inside Iran, the Iraqi troops
appeared to have withdrawn to their own borders within hours after
their forays into Iranian territory.
   After the war, a rebuilt Iran will pose a continuing challenge
to Iraq, which has a third of its neighbor's population.
   The two countries clashed diplomatically and militarily during
the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, which preceded Iran's
Islamic revolution.
   Under a 1975 pact, Iran agreed to stop financing Kurdish rebels
who posed a serious problem for the Iraqi government and to
guarantee free navigation along the Shatt Al-Arab, which leads to
Iraq's main port of Basra.
   Iraq's September 1980 invasion of Iran followed Iranian shelling
of Iraqi towns and a declaration to close the Shatt.
   Iraq renounced the 1975 agreement, claiming Iran already had
done so, but Iraqi officials continue to refer to the pact as a
basis for their claims to a strip along the central border.
   The Iraqi official said Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's acceptance
of a cease-fire has destroyed Iran's dream of spreading its version
of Islam throughout the region. ``This is a watershed between two
eras,'' he said.
   It means Iran has ``accepted the notion of coexisting with a
secular regime'' and accepted political boundaries, he said.
   ``By accepting that in a legal and political sense, it will be
the end of a model,'' he said, referring to Iran's hopes of
exporting its revolution.

   The barns of Vermont are part of
its history, say preservationists critical of companies that are
dismantling the familiar structures, moving them and reassembling
the frames for upscale housing.
   The barn movers say the barns are dilapidated victims of
neglect, and finding other uses is better than losing them
completely.
   ``Even if it goes out-of-state, people will see what an old barn
was,'' said Ken Epworth, a founder of Barn People of Woodstock,
which has been dismantling barns for more than a decade. ``You
can't see it if it's disappeared.''
   But preservationists like Eric Gilbertson say every barn that's
torn down makes it more difficult to identify Vermont's
agricultural heritage.
   ``Every state developed differently, and you can read a state by
looking at its old buildings,'' said Gilbertson, director of the
state's division for historic preservation. ``How do you recognize
a place that was a farm if the barns are gone?''
   Thomas Vissor, a professor with the University of Vermont's
historic preservation program, said pre-Civil War barns, known as
Yankee barns, face the greatest threat. They are likely to be of
sought-after post and beam construction with hand-hewn beams, and
often 30 feet by 40 feet, a good size for a house.
   The Yankee barns are characterized by a shallow pitch roof,
vertical planking on the outside, a large, hinged door on the long
side and three bays inside.
   ``If they were houses, we would certainly recognize them as
being historic,'' Vissor said.
   Epworth agreed that Vermont is losing its barns but said
dismantlers aren't to blame. ``More than any other factor, it's
deterioration,'' he said. ``Farmers aren't using them.''
   Epworth and his partner, David Hill, began by taking down old
houses for scrap, then barns. In the mid-1970s, as the old post and
beam architecture became popular again, they began using the frames
for new buildings.
   Most of their barns come from near White River Junction in
Vermont and New Hampshire. About a quarter of the barns remain in
Vermont, with the rest going out of state.
   People who buy the barns are looking for a piece of history and
architectural relics that can't be found among the staples and
plywood of the modern building industry, said Ken Arthur, a partner
in Vermont Historic Frames and Barns, which has dismantled six
barns in the last year.
   ``There's a gut love for the old buildings because they are not
made any more,'' said Arthur. ``It's like being in church for some
people. It's a feeling, you just can't put you finger on it.''
   It may be the wide beams of a single tree rippled slightly by
the ax blade, raised to the roof without a crane and hitched to the
rafters by tree nails, or wooden pegs.
   ``Once you see one, you fall in love,'' Arthur insisted.
   In recent years, Epworth said, the market for slate roofing has
fueled the loss of barns because someone taking only the slate and
burning or bulldozing the rest can work much faster than someone
who plans to use the frame, each piece of which must be marked for
reassembly.
   ``The buildings we're taking down are all dilapidated,'' he
said. ``We won't take down a perfectly good structure.''
   Nationwide, barns have been threatened by changing agricultural
practices. In response, the National Trust for Historic
Preservation last year sponsored a contest on remodeling old barns
for modern uses.
   Mary Humstone, director of the Denver-based Barn Again program,
said the 500 entries showed many economically feasible ways for
farmers to continue using their barns rather than replacing them.

   A partially deaf boy found
wandering the streets more than eight months ago traveled 700 miles
across Mexico to escape a life of erratic meals and begging,
welfare officials say.
   ``He was off looking for a life of his own,'' said Cecilia
Villarreal, director of the Casa Hogar del Nino, a government-run
home here where 9-year-old Jose de Jesus Garcia Aguilera now lives.
   Jose, one of five children of a poverty-stricken family, ran
away in October from his one-room house in the Gulf of Mexico port
of Tampico.
   His father lives in another city and doesn't support the family,
and investigations show the child often was sent out to beg for
money, authorities said.
   Jose was found Nov. 7 wandering the streets of Ciudad Juarez,
about 700 miles from Tampico, and was taken to a government welfare
agency there.
   ``We don't know how he got there, but this child knows how to
handle himself,'' Ms. Villarreal said last week.
   Officials in Ciudad Juarez and across the border in El Paso,
Texas, spent eight months trying to learn Jose's identity.
   Jose, who was called Sabath until his mother identified him, is
unable to write and only mumbles a few words. He communicates
mostly through gestures or pictures.
   But officials here say he's an intelligent child who only lacks
proper schooling.
   Many of the pictures the boy drew in Ciudad Juarez depicted an
airplane in flames, leading authorities to speculate that he might
have survived a plane crash.
   Specialists now say those pictures reveal a very active
imagination fueled by television and the fact that his home in
Tampico is next to an airport.
   Authorities say Jose left home because he knew the world had
more to offer than a tiny house, erratic meals and days spent
begging on the street.
   ``He's very savvy. And he's quite courageous because he went out
into the world knowing that it wasn't going to be easy,'' said
Fernando Mendez Cantu, a welfare official in Tamaulipas, the
northeastern border state where both Tampico and Ciudad Victoria
are located.
   Jose's mother, Micaela Aguilera, claimed him in late June and
took him home. But she works long hours in a bar and is unable to
properly care for the child, said Ms. Villarreal.
   Jose's oldest sister, a 13-year-old, takes care of the youngest
children most of the time.
   Jose now lives with 109 other children at Casa Hogar, a
children's home here run by DIF, the Spanish acronym for Integrated
Family Development.
   The home, one of four in the state and dozens throughout the
country, provides food, clothing, complimentary education and love
to children who have been abandoned or whose family is unable to
provide a decent upbringing.
   The children in the home range in age from less than a year to
15. About 40 percent of them have been abandoned, said Ms.
Villarreal.
   Jose now lives in a huge, clean dormitory with about two dozen
other boys in his age group. He is spending his summer taking
classes in art, swimming and dancing, all of them provided by the
government.
   In the fall, Jose will attend school for the first time, a
special education program where he'll learn to use sign language
and, perhaps, to speak.
   ``He's definitely an intelligent child. What he can't say in
words he makes up for with signals,'' said psychologist Gloria
Ferrel.
   The other children don't seem to struggle to understand Jose as
he pokes and points and pantomimes to make himself understood.
   Although Jose has been at the home just a couple of weeks, he
already has established himself as a leader.
   When the boys get together to play soccer, Jose is the one who
comes out of the dormitory carrying the ball.
   When the children line up for lunch at the cafeteria, Jose shows
a late arrival where he should stand.
   Yet authorities say they're keeping a watchful eye on the exit.
   They say Jose is just the kind of boy to round up a few friends
and take off.
   ``He's used to taking care of himself, so he has a few problems
with rules,'' said Ms. Ferrel.

   Gov. Bill Clinton has decided to accept
an invitation to appear on NBC's ``Tonight'' show with Johnny
Carson, who has comically savaged the governor's speech at the
Democratic National Convention.
   Clinton agreed Saturday to appear with Carson on Thursday's
show, said press secretary Mike Gauldin.
   Clinton's speech nominating Michael Dukakis for president, for
which 15 minutes were allotted, went more than double that time.
The speech was criticized by conventioneers as too long and was
panned by commentators as uninspiring.
   Minutes after Clinton began speaking, television cameras
switched from the podium to delegates making slashing motions
across their throats and yelling ``Cut!'' Some delegates were
asleep. The biggest cheer came when Clinton intoned the words, ``In
closing ...''
   Carson mentioned the invitation Friday night. ``It would be
great _ we won't have to book any other guests,'' Carson said, as
his studio audience howled.
   Gauldin said Clinton discussed the invitation with his aides
Saturday.
   ``It's a neat opportunity. He thinks it will be a lot of fun,''
Gauldin said.

   Former Vice President Walter Mondale says he
wishes people would believe him when he says he just wants to
practice law and dabble in politics and international affairs, but
stay out of big-time politics and government.
   Still, Mondale says public figures should ``never say `never,'
'' and that's what gets him into trouble.
   ``I can't respond to these questions without appearing to be a
candidate, then it looks like I'm ducking,'' Mondale said in an
interview with the Star Tribune. ``Some people just can't believe
that a person who's been in office all these years doesn't want to
run for something.''
   Mondale, who lost the presidential election to Ronald Reagan in
1984, moved back to Minneapolis last year to join a law firm.
   ``I enjoy where I am. I'm with an excellent law firm and it
permits me to have a more civilized schedule,'' said Mondale, 60.
``You know, I've done 18-hour days and seven days a week for about
30 years. Both Joan and I want to work, but we don't quite want to
live that intense pressure-cooker life.''

   It was just a simple dinner for a few
employees, customers, suppliers and public officials _ 4,000 in all
_ but millionaire Curt Carlson dressed things up with Bob Hope as
master of ceremonies.
   And Hope, who got a standing ovation at Saturday's dinner,
referred to the owner of 170 Radisson Hotels, 150 TGI Fridays, 260
Country Kitchens and 700 Ask Mr. Foster travel service outlets as
``super Swede.''
   The event marked the 50th anniversary of Carlson empire, Carlson
Companies, one of the nation's largest privately held businesses
with annual revenue of $4.2 billion.
   Carlson said he wasn't worried about the estimated $1 million
cost of the party or the public's preception of it. ``We haven't
splurged for 50 years. We're splurging a little bit. It's worth
it,'' he said.
   Hope concluded by performing his own theme song, ``Thanks for
the Memories,'' with a twist in Carlson's honor: ``Thanks for the
firm you built, In '38 you planted the seed, And it has grown
indeed. You started out small, Now you own it all, Even the king
calls you super Swede, How lucky you were.''

   New York Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio has
been discharged from a hospital 10 days after he underwent surgery
for an abdominal aortic aneurysm, his surgeon said.
   ``His prognosis is excellent. The reason he recovered so well is
that he's in excellent physical condition,'' said vascular surgeon
Manuel Sivina, who replaced the weakened section of blood vessel
with a Dacron graft.
   ``He did extremely well, no complications,'' he said Saturday.
   DiMaggio, 74, elected to have surgery after a routine
examination found that the aneurysm, discovered last year, was
worsening. The condition can be fatal if the artery ruptures.
   The Hall of Fame Yankee centerfielder and one-time husband of
Marilyn Monroe is due back next week for a checkup, but needs no
special drugs or diet regimen, the surgeon said.

   Soviet pianist Alexander Toradze says
he's been playing for a one-person audience lately even when the

   ``Her presence helps me artistically,'' Toradze, 36, said Friday
while in town for a concert. ``It's not that I am not playing for
an audience. I adore American audiences. However, to give your best
you need this inner force.''
   Asatiani, 59, is accompanying Toradze on his concert tour, which
includes stops in Los Angeles, Chicago, Saratoga, N.Y., and Fort
Worth, Texas, before her visa expires in September.
   It's the first time they have seen each other since Toradze
defected during a concert tour in Spain in 1985. He now lives in
New York City.

<HEAD>Burmese Leader to be Replaced Soon, Party Discusses Economic
Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A special congress of Burma's ruling party
is considering drastic economic changes and may sweep away the
rigid policies of former leader Ne Win when it chooses his
successor, official sources said Sunday.
   The sources, who refused to be identified further, said the
changes being contemplated by the Burma Socialist Program Party
include lifting barriers to private foreign investment for the
first time since Ne Win seized power in 1962.
   The 77-year-old Ne Win announced his resignation Saturday as
party chairman, citing his age and indirect responsibility for
bloody anti-government rioting in March and June.
   By party rules, action must taken to replace Ne Win by Monday,
the final day of the three-day congress, which is being held behind
closed doors.
   Five other top leaders, including Burmas's president and vice
president _ positions less powerful than the party chairman's _
offered their resignations Saturday.
   Prime Minister Maung Maung Kha, the most senior member of the
party's 17-member Central Executive Committee who has not resigned,
was seen as a likely replacement for Ne Win.
   Like all members of the government and party, Maung Maung Kha
has been overshadowed by Ne Win since assuming his post in 1977.
The 68-year-old former army officer is generally not regarded as a
forceful or imaginative leader.
   At the congress' opening session Saturday, Ne Win called for a
popular referendum on one-party rule in Burma.
   In an announcement believed connected to the referendum, state
radio said Sunday an emergency parliament session would convene
Wednesday. Under Burmese law, only the parliament can carry out
referendums.
   The emergency parliament session also could deal with the
appointment of new government leaders.
   Sources at the party congress said proposals being discussed by
the more than 1,000 delegates included an almost wholesale pullout
of the government from economic sectors it once tried to manage
with disastrous results. These include agriculture, fishing,
forestry, mining, heavy industry, trade and transportation.
   The sources said the proposals also include joint ventures
between private domestic and private foreign investors, which Ne
Win steadfastly opposed.
   If the proposals pass, the state monopoly on both foreign and
domestic trade would end and the vast and currently illegal
cross-border trade with neighboring countries would be legalized.
   News of both the possible economic changes and the resignation
of Ne Win has spread quickly through this capital of 3.5 million.
But public expression of opinion was minimal.
   ``They (the government) are responsible for our poverty,'' said
one pavement hawker Sunday, echoing a sentiment heard among
small-scale dealers in city markets.
   Burma, potentially one of the region's most prosperous nations
due to an abundance of natural resources, sank under Ne Win's
leadership to one of the world's 10 poorest nations. It has an
annual per capita income of less than $200.
   Since October, student-led demonstrations have three times
rocked Rangoon and other Burmese cities, resulting in deaths, mass
arrests and the closure of universities.
   The October demonstrations were sparked when the government
withdrew several currency notes from circulation without
compensation. More than 100 persons died in rioting in March and
June, according to Western diplomats.

   School officials are using newspaper
advertisements in an effort to recruit students from other
communities to pay tuition to attend Avon High School.
   ``I don't know of any school that is trying to maintain itself
by bringing students in from outside,'' said Peter Murphy, director
of the state Department of Education's district reorganization
efforts.
   Murphy said undersized schools usually collaborate or send
students to other school systems.
   The advertisments in the The Patriot Ledger of Quincy and The
Enterprise of Brockton tout the advantages of the school's low
7-to-1 pupil-teacher ratio, targeting students from large schools
in neighboring Brockton and Randolph.
   Avon, a town of about 5,200, is between the cities of Brockton
and Randolph, a few miles south of Boston.
   ``In a small school, the chances of individual attention are
greater and discipline tends to be stronger,'' Avon School
Superintendent Joseph Rappa said.
   Avon High's population has steadily declined from 700 students
about a dozen years ago to about 115 students in all four grades
this fall. For the school to continue, it needs to enroll about 35
new students this year and 60 and 80 more the following two years.
   Avon is asking out-of-town students to pay $1,500 annual tuition.

<TEXT>
   An Air France jet carrying 275 people
swerved off a runway at New Delhi's airport and crashed into a
field Sunday after the pilot aborted takeoff because he thought an
engine was on fire, airport officials said.
   No one was seriously injured in the accident, said the Airport
Authority. Indian news agencies said several passengers were
treated for minor cuts and bruises after evacuating the plane
through emergency chutes.
   The undercarriage and engines of the Boeing 747 jet were
seriously damaged as the plane swerved off the runway, plowed
across more than 300 yards of gravel and hit an airport antenna
before coming to rest in a field, the Airport Authority said in a
statement. Parts of the plane's wings were sheared off.
   N.K. Singh, chairman of the Airport Authority, told the Press
Trust of India news agency that the accident occurred when the
pilot aborted takeoff at the last minute after noticing a cockpit
warning light indicating that an engine was on fire.
   Authorities later put out a fire in a starboard engine of the
jet, but it could not be determined if the engine caught fire while
the jet was heading down the runway or after it crashed. One
passenger reported seeing an engine on fire before the jet swerved
off the runway, Press Trust of India said.
   Flight AF-187 was en route to Paris when the accident occurred
at 1:24 a.m. The flight originated in Beijing on Saturday. The news
agency said the jet was carrying French, Italian, German, Indian
and African passengers.
   Singh said an official inquiry was ordered into the crash.
   ``It was a providential escape, it could have been disastrous,''
said an Air France official who demanded anonymity. He said the
cause of the accident was not immediately known. ``It could be a
technical snag,'' he added.
   The plane carried 260 passengers and 15 crew members.

   This year's college graduates received
higher salary offers than last year's graduates, especially in
business fields, but the number of job offers declined slightly,
according to a survey released Sunday.
   The largest increase was in accounting, with graduates receiving
salary offers 10.9 percent higher than last year. The average
monthly offer rose from $1,812 to $2,010, for an average yearly
salary of $24,120.
   Job offers in accounting were down slightly from 5,478 to 5,264,
according to a College Placement Council survey released Sunday.
   The data included offers made to students graduating between
Sept. 1, 1987, and Aug. 31, 1988. Placement offices at 154 colleges
and universities participated in the survey. Acceptances were not
reported because August graduations were included.
   In business administration, the average salary offer rose 4.1
percent from $1,701 to $1,772, or $21,264 a year, but offers fell
from 1,788 to 1,285, the survey said.
   In banking, salary offers dropped 3.9 percent from $1,889 to
$1,815, or $21,780 a year, but the number of jobs increased from
395 to 527.
   Non-technical graduates received 48 percent of the job offers
made to graduates with bachelor's degrees, while technical
graduates received 52 percent of the offers.
   For non-technical graduates, 40 percent of the job offers came
from public accounting employers, while the electrical and
electronic machinery and equipment industry provided 16 percent of
the job offers to technical graduates.
   The average monthly salary offered to non-technical graduates
was $2,045, or $24,540 a year, according to the survey. Technical
graduates averaged monthly offers of $2,465, or $29,580.
   For master's of business administration candidates with
non-technical undergraduate degrees, starting offers increased 5
percent to $2,791, or $33,492 annually. Inexperienced MBA
candidates with technical undergraduate degrees attracted offers of
$3,192, or $38,304, an 11.8 percent rise.
   Technical and non-technical MBA graduates with previous
experience garnered increased salary offers between 4 percent and
16 percent, the survey said.
   The engineering field provided 42 percent of the job offers to
graduates with bachelor's degrees and was followed by business with
40 percent, sciences at 10 percent, humanities and social sciences
at 6 percent and communications at 2 percent.
   However, for master's degree candidates, business disciplines
made 52 percent of the offers; engineering, 36 percent; sciences, 8
percent; and humanities and social sciences, 4 percent.
   The survey reported men received slightly higher salary offers
in business administration, marketing and distribution, economics
and several science disciplines. Women received slightly higher
offers in engineering.

<TEXT>
   Aficionados of Ernest Hemingway concluded
a week-long celebration Sunday, honoring the author with contests
and plenty of Hemingwayesque celebrating at his favorite bar.
   The eighth edition of the annual Hemingway Days Festival
attracted almost 8,000 visitors over the weekend, according to
Festival Director Michael Whalton.
   ``The celebration continues to grow every year,'' Whalton said.
``Ernest Hemingway continues to fascinate people and they come to
Key West to relive some of his experiences.''
   Tom Cosselman, a retired plumbing contractor from Horton Bay,
Mich., won the Hemingway Look-Alike competition, which featured 52
entrants sporting _ or attempting to sport _ the late author's
distinctive graying beard and piercing eyes.
   ``The competition was pretty tough,'' said Cosselman, following
the final rounds held before a packed, raucous audience at Sloppy
Joe's Bar, Hemingway's favorite Key West tavern.
   ``All the fellows looked real good and its quite a feeling to be
standing there with a bunch of people that look like you,'' he
said. ``I feel a little bit more like Hemingway now and I think
I'll go out and do a bit of fishing.''
   Edwin Crooks, Jr. of Shrewsbury, N.J., won the Hemingway
Billfish Tournament by capturing a 238-pound blue marlin. The
three-day fishing contest featured 37 anglers on sportfishing boats
plying the same waters Hemingway fished more than 50 years ago.
   The festival's popular short story contest garnered 580 entries
from the United States, France and Switzerland.
   Mary McDaniel of Charleston, Ill., won the writing competition
with a story entitled ``The Dance for Three.''
   ``This is an extremely well-written story about the coming of
age of an old woman who is in a wheelchair and is a former
dancer,'' said Lorian Hemingway, Ernest Hemingway's niece and
coordinator of the shorty story contest.
   Hemingway wrote such classics as ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,''
``A Farewell to Arms,'' ``Green Hills of Africa'' and ``The Snows
of Kilimanjaro'' during the years he lived on this island.
   The 1988 edition of the Hemingway Days Festival also featured a
street fair, arm-wrestling competition, a series of seminars on the
author and a Hemingway play.

<TEXT>
   Police on horseback have been forced to
conduct daily Canada geese roundups because of a multiplying gaggle
that is stopping traffic, munching parched lawns and, er, making
people more careful where they step.
   ``The droppings are awesome,'' town administrator Bill Reid said
Sunday. ``Everywhere the geese go the droppings follow.''
   Since Canada geese are a protected species, it is illegal to
kill them. Residents shoo them off their lawns with brooms and honk
their car horns to get them out of the streets.
   ``They stop here in the course of their migration and people
feed them, so they stay instead of moving on,'' said officer Dan
Bates. ``At first people liked it, but now we're getting a lot of
complaints.''
   Kathleen Sullivan said Stoneham, a town of 23,000 about 10 miles
north of Boston, is known as a bedroom community, but the geese are
keeping residents awake at night with their honking.
   The flock also has raised the bacteria count at Spot Pond
Reservoir, which supplies drinking water for Stoneham and
neighboring towns.
   ``That's the main problem,'' said Mrs. Sullivan, a member of the
Board of Selectmen. ``The more they multiply, the more excretions
go in our water.''
   Town officials say the goose population has grown from a handful
when the birds arrived 10 years ago to about 650 birds, and the
flock is growing daily.
   Until recently, residents said, the geese usually stayed on a
patch of grass just north of a reservoir. But when hot weather
parched grass in late June and early July, the geese began
searching for greener pastures.
   ``They eat the grass in one place, and when there's no more,
they move down the street a little further,'' said Bates.
   As they forage, the geese have been stopping traffic at the
intersection of South Street and Route 28, one of the town's
busiest arteries. The problem became so acute last week that Dana
Owen and other officers mounted horses around noon every day to
herd the geese back across the street.
   In one yard, Owen said, ``It was just black with geese. You
couldn't see the lawn.''
   Paula Morrison, who lives near the reservoir, said she knows
it's illegal to kill the geese, but she can still hope. While
sweeping them off her lawn last week she said, ``I was hoping
several of them would get hit by a car.''
   Larry Gillis, a spokesman for the Metropolitan District
Commission, which controls the reservoir, said the MDC plans to put
up a snow fence to keep the birds off the street.
   But the best long-term solution, he said, would be for residents
and visitors simply to stop feeding the geese.
   Reid has other ideas.
   ``I think they should save four or five of them and get rid of
the rest. Ship them north,'' he said, adding, ``I hear they make
good eating.''

<HEAD>Moslem Pilgrims Sacrifice Sheep As Hajj Draws to Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Moslems on the annual
pilgrimage to Islam's holiest shrines Sunday ritually slaughtered
sheep on a plain in Saudi Arabia to commemorate Abraham's offer to
sacrifice his son to God.
   The ritual marked the end of the hajj, or pilgrimage, and the
start of the four-day Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice, which is
observed by about 850 million Moslems worldwide.
   More than 1 million Moslems _ including about 1,000 from the
United States _came to sacrifice sheep on the same plains outside
Mecca where, according to tradition, Abraham offered to sacrifice
his son. He substituted a sheep at the last minute when God ordered
him to stop the human sacrifice, tradition says.
   The ritual sheep sacrifice followed a series of religious rites
that began Friday with prayers at Mecca's Grand Mosque, Islam's
holiest shrine.
   Later that day, the crowds moved to the plains of Mina, where
they spent the night.
   For the climax of the hajj Saturday, the pilgrims climbed Mount
Arafat, about nine miles outside Mecca, where they prayed, listened
to sermons and chanted.
   Before dawn Sunday, they returned to the plains of Mina, where
they stoned the devil by casting seven pebbles at three pillars to
reject evil, or Satan. The act recalls Abraham's stoning of the
devil to avoid being tempted into disobeying God's command to
sacrifice his son.
   Saudi authorities have built special slaughterhouses, where the
Islamic Development Bank killed the 600,000 sheep _ at a cost of
$75 each _ for pilgrims who didn't want to do it themselves. The
meat is to be distributed to the poor in Moslem countries.
   Some pilgrims will return to Mina on Monday and Tuesday to stone
the devil again. Others will proceed to the holy city of Madina to
visit the tomb and mosque of the prophet Mohammed.
   All Moslems are expected to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at
least once, if they can afford it.
   King Fahd, the official custodian of the holy shrines, and Crown
Prince Abdullah, arrived in Mina on Saturday to supervise the final
stages of the hajj.
   The hajj is being observed under tight security this year to
avoid a repetition of last year's rioting that left 402 people
dead, most of them Iranian pilgrims.
   Iran claimed Saudi authorities opened fire on the pilgrims, but
Saudi officials said most of the deaths occurred during stampedes
after Iranians held anti-U.S. and anti-Saudi demonstrations.
   The Iranians boycotted this year's hajj after Saudi authorities
announced they would restrict the number of pilgrims who could come
to Saudi Arabia.
   Information Minister Ali Al-Shaer announced the ceremonies were
conducted in ``peace and security.''

   Two black men were killed when a
group attacked a funeral procession with long, curved knives, and a
third black man was stabbed to death in a separate attack, police
said Sunday.
   In their daily unrest report for the preceding 24 hours, police
said the attack on the funeral procession occurred at Guguletu, a
black township outside Cape Town.
   The other death occurred in Sweet Waters, in Natal province,
when a group of blacks attacked a man in a home, police said.
   In other incidents in Natal, police reported: ``A gunman fired a
shot at a house in Nhanhlakahle, near Greytown, injuring a black
man; another black man was stabbed in Vredville, near
Pietermaritzburg, the provincial capital, when a group of blacks
attacked a house and set it on fire; and one black man was injured
when blacks stoned a bus in Claremont, in Natal.''
   The report also said that members of two taxi associations
fought in Soweto, outside Johannesburg, resulting in one black man
being seriously wounded and five arrested. Elsewhere in the
township, a group of blacks burned a private vehicle and a house
was damaged by arsonists, police said.
   No further information was given about any of the incidents.
Fighting between different black political factions in the Natal
townships has been going on for more than a year, with an estimated
500 people killed.
   State-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest,
security force action, treatment of detainees, some forms of
protest and a range of statements classified as subversive.

   The Soviet leadership has replaced its ambassador
to Pakistan with an official of the Foreign Ministry's South Asia
Department, the Tass news agency reported Sunday.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's parliament,
sent Viktor Yakunin to the job in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. He
replaces Abdul-Rakman Vezirov, named Soviet ambassador to Pakistan
in May 1985, Tass said.
   The Presidium, or executive committee, transferred Vezirov to
other work, Tass said. It did not elaborate.
   Yakunin, who has been in diplomatic service since 1977, takes
over the Islamabad job at a critical time in the region. The Soviet
Union is withdrawing its more than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan,
which borders Pakistan.
   The Kremlin has complained that Pakistan is violating agreements
providing for the pullout by supplying aid to the rebels fighting
Afghanistan's government. The Afghan rebels are based in Pakistan.

<TEXT>
   A letter signed by about 10,000 people
expressing support for the captain and crew of the USS Vincennes
finally reached the Persian Gulf on Sunday after bouncing around in
limbo for five days.
   The letter, actually a bulky package weighing about 50 pounds,
apparently went from San Diego, Calif., to Sydney, Australia and
then back to London before it landed here and was turned over to
U.S. Navy officials.
   In London, an employee of DHL, the express delivery service that
handled the shipment, said it was not taken off an airliner that
landed at Bahrain last Wednesday, and went on to Sydney. It was
found there and returned to London.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth, said the letter would
be delivered to the Vincennes in a regular helicopter mail
shipment, probably on Monday.
   U.S. Rep. Bill Lowrey, R-Calif., sponsored the
signature-collection campaign last weekend to show support for the
Vincennes after its crew shot down an Iranian jetliner, killing all
290 aboard, on July 3. The Pentagon said the crew believed the
airliner was an Iranian jet fighter coming in for attack.
   San Diego is the missile cruiser's home port.
   One Navy source, who asked not to be named, said U.S. officials
were ``not overjoyed'' about the project even before the letter
went astray, because it drew new attention to the jetliner tragedy.
   A team of six U.S. experts is investigating the shooting down of
the Iran Air A300 Airbus.
   The Vincennes left the gulf four days ago after spending two
weeks at anchor here while investigators took depositions and
collected other data. Their report is due early next month.
   Navy spokesmen said the Vincennes is now in the Arabian Sea,
operating with the USS Forrestal's carrier battle group that
supports Navy operations in the Persian Gulf.
   It is due to return home in late August.
   The letter, described as hand-written on a large poster board,
expresses ``strong support'' for Capt. Will C. Rogers III and the
crew of the Vincennes ``as you strive to do your duty to God and
country in troubled waters far from home.''
   The signatures were on long rolls of paper attached to the
letter. The list was first reported to be about 570 feet long, four
feet longer than the cruiser itself. But Karl Higgins, an aide to
Lowrey, was quoted on Saturday as saying it was actually 1,000 feet
long.
   The 49th U.S. Navy convoy of the year was en route down the
gulf, with the missile frigate Nicholas escorting the U.S.-flagged
Kuwaiti tankers Townsend and Gas Queen, said a spokesman at U.S.
Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla.
   The convoy came a year to the day after another tanker, the
401,382-ton Bridgeton, struck a mine on the first upbound convoy of
Kuwaiti ships reflagged by the United States as protection from
Iranian attack.
   Iran accuses Kuwait of supporting Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The mining prompted a major buildup of U.S. and five European
navies in the gulf.
   The United States has about 14 warships in the gulf at present.
   Two vessels, the destroyer O'Brien and the missile frigate John
H. Sides, left the gulf for the United States on Sunday. They are
being replaced by the missile cruiser Reeves and the missile
frigate Vandegrift, according to U.S. military sources.

<TEXT>
   This city known for cigar-chomping politicians
and smoke-filled rooms on Sunday became the latest to try to clear
the air, banning smoking in a host of public places ranging from
taxis to train terminals.
   Despite the threat of fines, there were already indications of
rebellion.
   ``I'll smoke in my own cab no matter what the law says,'' said
taxi driver Dean Davis, 44, a three-pack a day smoker.
   ``I will never tell a passenger not to smoke,'' said Davis, who
had two packs of cigarettes sitting next to him on the front seat
of his cab.
   The ordinance passed May 25 by the City Council is similar to
regulations passed by several other cities, including New York and
Los Angeles.
   It bans smoking entirely in enclosed public areas such as
meeting rooms and taxicabs and requires restaurants with 40 seats
or more to set aside smoking and non-smoking areas.
   It requires that at least half the areas of airport terminals,
train stations and bus depots be non-smoking.
   The law also addresses smoking in the work place. Employers must
designate smoking and no-smoking areas if workers request them. No
smoking signs must be posted in all designated areas.
   Bars and private meetings are exempt from the ordinance, which
carries fines ranging from $25 to $100.
   Police will follow the rule of ``persuasion and warning to seek
compliance,'' said Lt. John Culloton, adding that investigating
complaints of illegal smoking will not be a top priority.
   ``With all the calls we get for rapes, robberies and everything
else, that won't be often,'' he said.
   Taxi driver Suheil Ajaj said he thinks the law ``stinks''
because it will reduce business.
   ``I believe the customer is paying for the right to smoke,'' he
said. ``I'm not a smoker, but I think it's their right to smoke in
my cab.''
   ``I think it's a pain for everybody,'' said Sam Sianas, owner of
Billy Goat's Tavern, a watering hole off Michigan Avenue.
   Sianas said the vast majority of his patrons smoke, so even
though he intends to designate 15 of his 90 seats as non-smoking
the overall impact will hardly be noticed because ``the smoke blows
all around.''
   ``How can you stop them from smoking?'' he asked. ``You can put
up a sign, but I'm not going to grab a cigarette out of somebody's
hand.''
   Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer favors the new law, which was
supported by 33 aldermen.
   But Alderman Edward Burke, one of eight who opposed the measure,
said police ``would be better placed trying to chase criminals than
smokers.''
   Don Rose, a political analyst, said Chicago's ban won't
necessarily change the image of the city of big shoulders.
   ``The so-called smoke-filled room is an image of something going
on out of the sight of the public, so the smoking ban would not
affect it,'' he said.
   And with a rise in the number of non-smokers, ``the smoke-filled
room itself is not necessarily smoke-filled,'' Rose said.

   Iraq said Sunday it withdrew its forces
from Iranian territory after a major incursion, taking thousands of
war prisoners. Iran's president headed for the front lines and
called on his countrymen to join him in ``divine duty.''
   Also Sunday, a four-man U.N. team arrived in Tehran to discuss
prisoners of war. A second U.N. team is expected to arrive in the
Iranian capital within the next few days to work out details of a
cease-fire.
   Iran's foreign minister said the Iraqi offensives threatened a
cease-fire.
   The official Iraqi News Agency announced that Iraq's incursion
in the southern war front, which began Friday, was over and that
Iraqi troops had withdrawn.
   Iran said Saturday that Iraqi troops backed by tanks, warplanes
and chemical weapons thrust nearly 40 miles into Iranian territory.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Sunday the attack
had been repulsed with 9,000 Iraqi dead and wounded.
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei called his people to action in a
message broadcast on Tehran radio.
   ``Now that the Iraqi troops have stepped on the Islamic
territory of Iran, no response except that of weapons is
permissible,'' Khamenei said in the message, which was monitored in
Nicosia.
   ``The nation must rush to the assistance of the armed forces,''
Khamenei said, adding that he ``will take my worthless body and
life to the front of justice and present myself for divine duty.''
   As Khamenei headed for the front lines, Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akhbar Velayati left for New York to meet with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Velayati said he had sent Perez de Cuellar a letter saying Iraqi
military action threatened a cease-fire and calling for the United
Nations to take ``timely and preventive action,'' Tehran radio said.
   The U.N. chief has invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to
New York for peace talks.
   Interviewed Sunday on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,''
Perez de Cuellar said he hoped hostilities would cease when he
began discussions with the two leaders.
   ``Until there is a cease-fire, I cannot complain,'' the
secretary-general said. ``The only thing which I have done ... is
to make an appeal to both sides to exert restraint. And I hope, of
course, that when ... I start my discussion with the parties, I
think there will not be military activities in the area.''
   Asked if upcoming Iran-Iraq peace talks would be held
face-to-face, Perez de Cuellar said: ``My idea is to discuss
separately with both sides. Of course, I will be only too pleased
if, at some stage, I could have the two sides together.''
   Iraq wants to hold direct negotiations. Iran refused but later
indicated it might agree to them at Perez de Cuellar's request.
   In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, the state-run daily Ath-Thawra
said Iraq has ``no greedy intentions on Iranian territory and does
not want to humiliate the Iranian people.''
   The article, quoted by the Iraqi News Agency, said Iraq's
military actions following Iran's acceptance of the U.N. cease-fire
resolution last week were designed to recapture Iraqi territory to
take ``as many prisoners of war as possible.''
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said taking a large number of
prisoners would help in peace negotiations.
   Iraq accepted the resolution, which calls for return to previous
borders and a prisoner exchange, when it passed a year ago.
   Iraq claims it captured 8,636 prisoners of war in its incursion
Friday and Saturday.
   According to International Red Cross figures, Iran has about
50,000 Iraqi POW's and Iraq held 13,000 Iranian soldiers before the
latest raid.
   IRNA said the Iranian Cabinet met Sunday and praised the Iranian
people for heeding the call to join soldiers at the battlefronts.
   The Cabinet announced that on August 2, a Moslem holy day in
Iran, mass rallies would be held by Iranians ``to reaffirm their
allegiance to Imam (Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini.
   Iraq said its aircraft flew 148 combat missions inside Iran on
Sunday and that two planes crashed in Iranian territory. Iran said
the two jets were shot down.
   The Iraqi communique said helicopter gunships carried out 217
combat sorties ``inflicting important losses on enemy men, weaponry
and equipment.''
   It said four Iranian soldiers were killed in other minor action.
   The Iranian agency said the border town of Karand-e-Gharb in the
Bakhtaran province was hit by ``cluster bombs'' and seven civilians
were killed. Iraq denied the claim.

   Buddhist rebels shot and killed five
Moslem settlers and wounded three others in an ambush on a ferry in
southern Bangladesh, police said Sunday.
   The Chakma rebels are opposed to a government program resettling
Moslems from the plains to hilly land. They attacked a boat
Saturday ferrying 50 settlers near the hill town of Rangamati,
about 120 miles southeast of Dhaka, a police officer said.
   The Chakmas have been fighting a guerrilla war for more than a
decade to halt the program. They say the settlers would outnumber
them in the dense forests of the rugged Chittagong Hill Tracts,
which cover about 5,000 square miles. More than 4,000 people have
died in the conflict.

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Says Navy Will Be Withdrawn as Soon As `Prudent'
^EDs: Adds 5 grafs with White House comment on hostages.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

   A cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war means the
United States would reduce its naval forces in the Persian Gulf and
halt the escort of tankers ``as soon as we judge it safe, prudent
to do so,'' Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Sunday.
   Carlucci said it is too early to specify a date for a halt in
the 1-year-old administration policy of protecting the reflagged
Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attacks.
   ``It's a little hard to make that kind of judgment at this
point,'' Carlucci said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' when asked about
a date for ending the escorts.
   ``We want to watch the negotiations. We'd probably want to take
some reasonable interval to make certain that the ceasefire
holds,'' he said. ``But there's no desire to keep 27 ships there
any longer than possible.''
   Carlucci noted that Navy ships will remain in the gulf, as they
have for 40 years, but said ``we would certainly draw down (the
number of U.S. ships) as soon as feasible.'' Until the reflagging
policy began, the Navy had only five or six ships in the waterway.
   Iran last week agreed to accept the terms of United Nations
resolution 598, which proposes a ceasefire as the first major step
toward a negotiated peace. That raised hopes that the bloody
8-year-old conflict would soon end.
   But as representatives of both countries prepare to meet this
week at the United Nations, Iraq has launched a series of attacks
into Iran.
   Carlucci and John Whitehead, the deputy secretary of state, both
said Reagan administration policies deserve credit for influencing
Iran's decision to accept the resolution.
   ``The fact that we have been resolute, that we have stood by our
friends, that we have stood by the principles of freedom of
navigation and that he (Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini)
has not been able to drive us from the gulf has had a significant
impact on Iranian thinking,'' Carlucci said.
   ``Furthermore, our staunchness in this area has helped to
isolate Iran in the world community,'' Carlucci said. ``We have
been quite successful in preventing our countries from shipping
arms to Iran, so gradually Iran came to the realization that their
policies were not succeeding, that they were not going to drive us
out of the area.''
   Whitehead, appearing on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,''
said, ``this is a time if not for bragging, at least it's a time, I
think, for all of us to be proud that our policy has been a
success.''
   ``Certainly Iran's decision is not solely attributable to U.S.
policy,'' he said, ``but our firmness of our military presence in
the gulf, our indication that we planned to stay there as long as
it was necessary, and at the same time our diplomatic track,
principally at the United Nations, has finally achieved success.''
   Both men also said an end to the war could eventually lead to
improved U.S.-Iran relations and the possible release of American
hostages held in Lebanon by Iranian-backed groups.
   Carlucci said he didn't know about any ``specific message'' from
Iran seeking improved relations, but added, ``We have consistently
said that we're prepared to enter into a dialogue with Iran, all
they have to do is designate somebody who is officially empowered
to talk to us and we'd be glad to talk with them about policy
issues, about terrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about
whatever is appropriate.
   ``If they want to talk about policy issues, hostages, terrorism
... we'd be pleased to do that,'' he said.
   Asked specifically about reports the U.S. hostages might be
released, Carlucci said, ``We're obviously not going to discuss any
quid pro quo (with Iran), but if the Iranians want to talk to us
about the hostage situation and how they're going to go about
influencing their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about
it.''
   Nine Americans are being held hostage in Lebanon.
   ``I'm not in the slightest suggesting that there would be any
deal for the hostages. That is contrary to our policy,'' he said.
   As President Reagan boarded Air Force One to return to
Washington from California, he was asked whether the United States
was ready for talks about the hostages.
   He appeared not to hear the question and did not respond.
   Later, aboard the plane, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the hostage situation is easy to solve.
   ``All they have to do is release them,'' he said.
   ``They don't need negotiations to release the hostages. We are
willing to talk to anybody any place but we are not willing to
negotiate. We are not willing to pay ransom. There is no need. They
took them they should release them. As far as we are concerned
nothing has changed in regard to the hostages,'' said Fitzwater.

<HEAD>Lacroix Leads Couture Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian Lacroix kicked off a week of haute
couture shows for winter Sunday with plenty of luxury and an
about-face in style, abandoning the short pouf skirts that made him
famous and presenting a variety of styles.
   His show received politely enthusiastic response from the buyers
and press, but there was no screaming ovation, as there was at last
year's.
   Some found the show rather confusing, as if Lacroix didn't
always know what to do with all that lovely fabric. In clothes
aimed at opulence, the effect was sometimes perfect, sometimes
awkward or heavy-looking.
   But most agreed these clothes look much more wearable than the
past _ even though couture is only worn by a handful of women who
pay astronomical prices, well up in the thousands of dollars, for a
simple dress.
   Lacroix kept his sense of fun in bright miniskirts with full
paisley overskirts, worn with jeweled suede boots and an oversized
hat.
   His new suit looks varied. One red model with a long jacket and
short skirt was a dead ringer for the Chanel style. Another is the
short-long effect with the billowing overskirt to offset a shorter
skirt underneath.
   The full pantskirts or flowing pajamas were sometimes given a
buttoned-up, high-waisted sailor suit look, dressed up with mink
capes or fox jackets. Cowl hoods and draped fichu collars are still
Lacroix trademarks.
   The great invention of the collection was a tuxedo. It came out
as a smashing dark crepe jumpsuit with big rhinestone buttons,
large white satin lapels and cuffs on the jacket.
   The evening gowns were varied and elaborate, with brown in
brocades, chiffons and velvet a big favorite. But Lacroix juggled
his palette throughout the show, alternating combinations of hot
colors with softly graded combinations.
   A midnight blue velvet sheath with its topping of a puffy bow
and train of many-hued brown, blue and grey tulle was a knockout.
   Following the Lacroix show was the evening wear at Hanae Mori's
show.
   Each carefully made black-gray-white model drifted out painted
or decorated with seagulls and waves, birds, butterflies and trees.
Dresses featured large leaf patterns and trim.
   Mrs. Mori showed a wearable collection of outfits that showed
the knee, emphasized intricate draping and detail and brought out
some flyaway toppers, shorter in the front.

<HEAD>Bush Urges New $2.2 Billion Child-Care Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 6th graf pvs, ``This is, with 2 grafs to CORRECT Wray
quote</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, trying to
bolster his standing among women voters, on Sunday proposed a
wide-ranging child-care proposal that could give low-income
families government checks of up to $1,000 per child.
   The proposed program would cost $2.2 billion a year and
eventually apply to all families with children under age 4 in which
at least one parent worked, Bush said.
   Families who didn't get a government check would get a tax
credit, under the plan Bush outlined the National Federation of
Business and Profession Women's Clubs.
   At first, it would apply only to low-income families, and would
be phased in over four years to include higher-income households.
   Initial reaction to Bush's proposal was favorable, but tempered
with criticism of his overall record on women's issues.
   ``This is one of his first concrete gestures'' toward women,
said federation president Beth Wray.
   Asked how she would rate the speech, she replied: ``As far as
addressing our issues, he escalated on any scale. But as far as
addressing the kinds of things we'd like to see advanced, he didn't
come close to a 10.''
   After Bush's speech, many members of the audience chanted
``E-R-A,'' a reference to the Equal Rights Amendment, which Bush
opposes.
   The vice president said the tax credit, which would be in
addition to the existing child care tax credit and the federal
deduction for dependents, is designed ``to recognize the increased
costs of families with children.''
   There would be no strings attached to the tax credit and it
would apply equally to those who paid for outside child care and
those who didn't.
   ``As businesswomen, I don't need to tell you that child care is
a significant business expense,'' Bush told the audience, made up
of about 2,500 professional women.
   The certain GOP presidential nominee, who has proposed an
overall freeze on federal spending at the rate of inflation, did
not specify how his wide-ranging proposals would be financed.
   He was accompanied to the speech by former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, a frequently mentioned vice presidential
possibility.
   Mrs. Dole, wife of former GOP rival Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole, accompanied Bush here aboard Air Force Two, and, according to
Bush aides, helped worked on the final draft of his speech.
   Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate said that there was no discussion
during the flight of the vice presidential selection process. Mrs.
Dole spoke to the convention after Bush.
   Bush's criticized a $2.5 billion day-care proposal now before
Congress _ and favored by Democrat Michael Dukakis _ that would
provide direct government assistance to day-care providers. It
would not be limited to low-income families.
   Bush's child-care program included:
   _Expansion of the existing child-care tax credit to cover more
low-families, at a cost of $400 million a year.
   _Creation of work-place child-care centers for all government
employees, modeled after a program begun by Mrs. Dole at the
Transportation Department, and a federally underwritten liability
insurance program for private centers, costing $50 million a year.
   _More federal assistance to help states and local governments
set up programs such as sick child care and before-and-after school
care, at a cost of $250 million.
   Bush's proposals received polite, but scattered, applause from
the bipartisan audience. ``I'm not going to give you a political
speech,'' he declared.
   However, he told the audience that ``one of my attributes for
president is I did what many of you did _ I started a business.''
   ``The expanded role for women in the work force is dramatic. It
is the single most important demographic change in the second half
of the 20th century,'' he said.
   But still, Bush noted that women still earn only 70 cents for
every dollar earned by men.
   He said that, while this was up from the 59 cents of just a few
years ago, ``there is only one amount that women should earn for
every dollar earned by a man _ and that is one dollar.''
   Members of the audience cheered this remark loudly and waved red
purses, a symbol of the disparity in pay between genders. Bush was
presented with such a purse.
   Campaign aides depicted the speech as a major effort to
underscore Bush's commitment to issues affecting working women. His
campaign has been making a push to improve his standing among women
voters, shown by a series of polls to be a weak point for him.
   Republican analysts have said that part of the ``gender gap''
problem _ which also afflicted President Reagan in both 1980 and
1984 _ reflects voter registration breakdown: a greater proportion
of women are Democrats than men.
   However, some women's groups have accused Bush, as well as the
overall Reagan administration, of insensitivity to women's issues
and other social concerns and an overemphasis on defense issues.
   Asked why Bush did not mention the Equal Rights Amendemnt in his
talk, aide Deborah Steelman said, ``These are today's relevant
issues.''
   But Betty Forbes, president-elect of the organization, said,
``He may be beyond it (the ERA) but we are not.''

<HEAD>Report Says Secret Talks Held On Southwestern Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Military officials from Angola, Cuba,
South Africa and the United States met privately on an island off
the African coast in an effort to work out a peace accord for
southwestern Africa, a news report said Sunday.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted a Cape Verde government
spokesman as saying the meetings occurred last week on the island
of Sal in the Cape Verde archipelago.
   South Africa's foreign minister, Pik Botha, confirmed that
representatives of the four nations met on the island Thursday and
Friday. He did not name the representatives.
   ``During the meeting, there was an exchange of views on the
military situation which will continue to be discussed in the
forthcoming meeting to be held in Geneva,'' he said.
   After U.S.-mediated negotiations in New York, the nations on
July 20 announced an agreement in principle for the withdrawal of
foreign troops from Angola and independence for neighboring
South-West Africa, which is also known as Namibia. South Africa has
ruled Namibia for 73 years.
   More talks are scheduled in Geneva next month.
   The Portuguese agency quoted unidentified Cape Verde officials
as saying that the talks there were mediated by Pentagon official
James Wood. It quoted the officials as saying the talks may have
been aimed at setting a timetable for the troop withdrawals and for
the implementation of Namibia's independence.
   In Washington, Maj. David Super, Pentagon weekend duty officer,
said he knew nothing about the talks or the possible participation
of Wood.
   The Portuguese agency, in a report from the capital, Praia,
quoted Cape Verde government spokesman Fernando Carrilho as saying
that the delegations were headed by Angola's armed forces commander
in chief, Antonio Franca Nadula; his Cuban counterpart, Gen. Jannie
Geldenhuys; and Gen. Ulysses Rosala Deltor of South Africa.
   Earlier, Lusa said the delegations were headed by deputy foreign
ministers of the nations.
   The report said Foreign Minister Silvino da Luz of Cape Verde
also was at the meetings.
   The talks are aimed at ending a 13-year war in Angola, where
guerrillas backed by South Africa and the United States are
fighting the Marxist government, supported by Cuba and the Soviet
Union.
   There are about 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola, according to U.S.
estimates.
   South Africa says it has 3,000 troops in Angola, but the
Angolans say the figure is 9,000.
   Cape Verde is a former Portuguese colony where Angola and South
Africa held their first face-to-face talks in the early 1980s.
   The latest round of negotations began in May. Talks were also
held in London and Cairo, with Angolan-South African talks in
Brazzaville, Congo.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a repentant sinner, Mexico's governing
party is finding it difficult to convince others it has seen the
light.
   Even if national elections on July 6, when the Institutional
Revolutionary Party won by the slimmest margin in its 59 years of
existence, were as squeaky clean as the party claims, many Mexicans
remain skeptical.
   Officials of the party that has dominated modern Mexico's
government now admit _ at least in private _ that misdeeds were not
unknown in the past.
   ``But look at what we did this time,'' one said in frustration,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If we wanted to act as we did
in the past, the opposition would not have obtained anything.''
   Indeed, whether forced by circumstance or out of genuine belief
in reform, the party, known as PRI, conceded congressional defeats
and grudgingly settled for a 50.3 percent majority for its winning
presidential candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   However, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic
Front finished with 31 percent, and Manuel J. Clouthier of the
conservative National Action Party gained 17 percent.
   Despite the opposition's best showing in decades, both Cardenas
and Clouthier have taken to the road, calling on Mexicans to
challenge the tallies, which they say are fraudulent.
   The PRI had never before fallen below the 70 percent level.
Moreover, what people here call the ``full-wagon'' policy _ 100
percent of everything _ is not that distant a memory.
   In what may have been the most difficult statement ever uttered
by a PRI official, Salinas said in proclaiming his victory: ``The
era of virtually only one party is ending, and we are entering now
a new political stage.''
   Until now, modern Mexican history has made ``PRI'' practically a
synonym for ``government.''
   The PRI was created in 1929 by government leaders as an
instrument to retain power through the control of labor unions,
peasant organizations indebted to government financing agencies,
bureaucrats and teachers.
   It used, and still uses, government resources as its own.
   Any political opposition was considered against the 1910-21
revolution.
   Congress was a key part of the PRI's domain. In a supposedly
federal system, the party leadership in Mexico City assigned
congressional seats, governships, municipalities, and other
government jobs to the country's regions.
   This time, the PRI will not have the two thirds needed in the
Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of congress, to make
constitutional amendments.
   In a complicated system that offers 300 of 500 seats for direct
election and reserves a significant portion of the rest for the
opposition, the PRI will hold 260 and the combined opposition 240.
   In a development that will have less impact but is perhaps more
symbolic, the PRI gave up for the first time four of the 64 seats
in the Senate.
   Despite government claims, ballot-stuffing and take-all habits
do, of course, die hard.
   Journalists witnessed ballot stuffing in the northern border
state of Chihuahua. Other allegations were widespread throughout
the country.
   A slow vote count lingered from the old system when people
voted, the government took the ballot boxes, and two weeks later
announced who won.
   Official results were not announced until July 13, a week after
the election.
   Even for the nonpartisan, suspicions were hard to avoid.
   Electoral officials privately said there were more voters this
time than in previous elections. Yet their totals show that only
half of 38 million registered voters went to the polls, compared to
75 percent in 1982.
   Even the most loyal party officials privately admit that past
figures were inflated to enhance PRI's reputation or simply to
spread the illusion of support for the system and cover up voter
apathy.
   Despite widespread skepticism, Salinas and his reform-minded
associates had insisted during the campaign that they intended to
modernize and democratize the PRI and Mexico.
   ``Keep in mind this is a new experience for us all,'' one top
government official said in an interview. ``We will have to learn
to live with it.''
   ``This is a Mexican perestroika,'' the official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. He was referring to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of social and economic reforms.

   Forty years after President Harry Truman
ordered the integration of the armed forces, black veterans of the
Korean War have won a battle for a fresh look at an Army history
they find disparaging.
   The Army has ordered a review of accounts of a black regiment
that could lead to a change in the official history.
   Executive Order 9981, issued by Truman 40 years ago Tuesday, did
not bring immediate integration to the military, in which black
units were largely segregated and commanded by whites.
   But ``as a result of Truman's order, the military became one of
the first major American institutions to desegregate and routinely
place blacks in positions of authority over whites,'' says Edwin
Dorn of the Joint Center for Political Studies in Washington.
   The military, grudgingly at first, served ``as an engine of
social change and racial justice,'' Dorn wrote in the May edition
of the center's magazine.
   The last major black unit, the Army's 94th Engineer Battalion,
was not broken up until 1954.
   And when the Korean War broke out, two years after Truman issued
his order, the 24th Infantry Regiment was still an all-black
outfit, commanded by white officers, on occupation duty in Japan.
   The 24th was among the first units sent to Korea, and was
bloodied in the battles which raged up and down the penninsula.
   An official Army history of the first months of the war, written
by Roy Appleman and issued in 1961, describes the performance of
the 24th in highly uncomplimentary terms, glossing over a battle at
Yechon, an engagement that another book published last year calls
the first major U.S. victory in the war.
   The Army's treatment of the 24th Regiment rankled Korean War
veteran David K. Carlisle, a black graduate of West Point who has
campaigned for nine years for a revision of Appleman's work.
   The official history, Carlisle said in an interview, ``uses
terms which are offensive. The ulterior motive, like all other
references to black combat units, is intended to denigrate the
contributions that black fighting men have made for our country.''
   Army Secretary John O. Marsh Jr. this month ordered that the
Chief of Military History, Brig. Gen. William A. Stofft, to review
Appleman's work ``to address expressed concerns about the portrayal
of the 24th Infantry Regiment.''
   An Army spokesman, Maj. Greg Rixon, said it is not clear what
will happen if Appleman's version is found to be flawed. Appleman,
said Rixon, is ill and not available to comment.
   Carlisle, however, is confident the official version will be
revised, which he says is ``extremely gratifying to me.''
   The official history calls the 24th ``an all Negro-regiment''
and repeatedly describes it in terms more negative than used for
all-white regiments under what were apparently similar
circumstances.
   The 24th, wrote Appleman, was ``frightened and demoralized,''
had a ``tendency to panic,'' ``straggled'' in retreat, and required
two officers for every one in another unit: ``one must command and
the other must drive.''
   Nearly all U.S. units in the war retreated in disorder at
various times, especially after the Peoples' Republic of China
joined the fight, but Appleman time after time singled out the 24th
for what he called a ``chaotic'' flight, or a ``disgraceful
episode.''
   The most glaring slight seems to have been in the official Army
description of the battle of Yechon.
   ``The first action (for the 24th) ... if indeed it was an action
at all, appears to have occured at Yechon on 20 July,'' Appleman
wrote.
   An Associated Press dispatch on July 20-21 by war correspondent
Tom Lambert, who was with the unit, described Yechon as ``the first
sizable American ground victory in the Korean War.''
   And an official Army report at the time called Yechon ``the
first South Korean city restored to friendly hands by American
troops. Although it was not a tremendous victory, many believed it
symbolic of the liberation of South Korea.''
   Clay Blair, author of the 1987 history, ``The Forgotten War,''
wrote that ``the victory was reason for blacks to celebrate ....
But Yechon was not long remembered. Moreover, the Army later
attempted to obliterate it from the official record.''
   Calisle was assigned to the 77th Engineer Combat Company, which
served in close proximity to the 24th Regiment, along with an
another black officer, Col. Charles M. Bussey, who was decorated
for his heroism at Yechon.
   ``Bussey arrived on the scene and saw North Korean units
attempting to outflank the 24th,'' Carlisle said by telephone from
his home in Los Angeles. ``Bussey commandeered a 50 calibre machine
gun and killed 258 enemy, almost singlehandedly.''
   Bussey was awarded a Silver Star and a Purple Heart after the
engagement, and according to Blair and Carlisle was nominated for
the Medal of Honor.
   He might have become the first black officer to win the highest
American combat award, ``but somewhere up the line the medal was
killed,'' wrote Blair.
   Carlisle has reactivated the nomination of Bussey for the medal,
which he calls his next fight against ``Army racism.''

<HEAD>Jurors Doubt Verdict Against Migrant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three members of a jury that convicted a
Mexican migrant worker of murder have formed a support group for
the man after voicing doubts about their decision.
   ``I feel there is a really good chance he is innocent and we
need to do something about it,'' Sherien Jaeger said in an
interview with The Sunday Oregonian.
   Jaeger voted to convict Santiago Ventura Morales as a jury
member in October 1986. Ventura was sentenced to life in prison for
the crime.
   Jaeger said she has been tormented by doubt ever since the trial.
   She said another juror, Patricia Lee, called her three days
after the trial and ``said she felt very uncomfortable.''
   ``She asked me how I felt,'' Jaeger said. ``I just felt that I
had made a mistake, and I didn't know what to do about it.''
   Now Jaeger, Lee and a third juror, David Ralls, visit Ventura in
prison, send money and write letters to the state Parole Board
pleading for his release.
   Transcripts from the trial show that only one witness, an
illegal immigrant from Mexico, testified that Ventura was the
killer. The witness, Epifanio Bautista Lopez, initially testified
that he saw nothing, but changed his testimony after a recess and
he was taken into the district attorney's office.
   Under cross-examination, Bautista said he was afraid of what
might happen to him if he did not testify the way the prosecutor
wanted him to testify.
   While jurors deliberated, they initially were split over the
question of Ventura's guilt. Jaeger was among those voting not
guilty. Unable to reach a verdict, the jury was excused for the
night.
   Back in the jury room the next morning, Jaeger changed her vote
to guilty, leaving only Lee and Glorya Oppitz on the innocent side,
and they eventually relented.
   Oppitz has refused to join the support group formed by Jaeger,
Lee and Ralls, but said she would like to erase the trial from her
memory.
   Other jurors said they had no second thoughts.
   ``I felt he was guilty because he never testified,'' said Alma
Dennis, another juror.
   Several days after the trial, Lee, Oppitz, Ralls and Jaeger
visited defense co-counsel Lane Borg, saying they had changed their
minds and asking if they could do anything about it.
   Borg found that a verdict cannot be thrown out simply because
jurors change their minds. The support group has decided that if
all other legal recourse fails, they will ask Gov. Neil Goldschmidt
to commute Ventura's sentence. Meanwhile, an appeal is pending.

<HEAD>Government Balks at Paying Mortgage on Seized House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is refusing to
pay off the mortgage on a confiscated $1.1 million home, arguing
that Republic National Bank of Miami should have known the house
was bought with drug money.
   ``At best for the bank, Republic stuck its head in the sand to
avoid obtaining the knowledge of the drug connection,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Alan Dagen charged in court papers.
   Republic seeks repayment on its loan to a Panamanian company the
government says was controlled by convicted smuggler Indalecio
Iglesias.
   ``If this is upheld, it could force banks to run FBI checks on
every borrower,'' said Stan Beiley, attorney for Republic.
   Under federal laws, the government may seize properties bought
or built with drug profits, or homes in which drug deals occurred.
The laws also provide that the government must honor mortgages or
liens on seized properties _ if the mortgage holder is an innocent
party.
   After the government seized the palatial five-bedroom home in an
exclusive Coral Cables neighborhood last month, the bank asked that
its one-year $800,000 mortgage be paid off when the house was sold.
But the government refused.
   Federal prosecutors contend in court documents that Iglesias was
laundering his ill-gotten gains when his Thule Holding Corp.
pledged its sole asset _ the house _ as collateral for the mortgage
in 1987.
   ``Of course, we didn't know anything about it. We had no idea,''
Republic President Frederick de la Mata told The Miami Herald
Sunday.
   No charges are pending against Iglesias, although he was
convicted of smuggling marijuana in 1981.
   The government says Republic should have guessed a drug
connection existed.
   ``Despite suspicious circumstances, Republic looked the other
way while accepting gratuities from Iglesias,'' the government says
in court papers, which allege the house was built using the
millions of dollars Iglesias earned smuggling drugs from 1980 to
1985.
   Thule allegedly paid for airplane tickets and a hotel room for
de la Mata's son's honeymoon only three days after the $800,000
mortgage was approved in a hastily called meeting of Republic's
loan committee. De la Mata contends that Ramon Puentes, an old
customer with no connection to Thule, gave his son the trip.
   The government also says the bank should have been suspicious in
part because de la Mata knew Thule was trying to sell the house.
Also, granting the mortgage in just two weeks was unusual, as was
granting a loan when the house was vacant, something banks rarely
do, court papers say.
   Bank attorneys say the government hasn't proved that Iglesias
was involved in smuggling in 1985, when the house was built, or
that drug profits were used.

<DATELINE>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's attorney general, angered
by the slayings of a TV anchorwoman and two others in a hail of
police bullets, suspended the Juarez head of the federal police and
vowed to press an investigation.
   One federal police officer and three city police officers were
arrested in the machine gun attack Saturday in downtown Juarez.
   ``My indignation is great,''said Attorney General Sergio Garcia
Ramirez, who visited Juarez late Saturday and vowed the four
officers would be brought to justice.
   Garcia pledged that ``the bad elements (in the federal force)
will be removed. There are good elements in the force, ones who
devote their lives to it. That isn't the case in this instance. ...
We won't let this blow over.''
   The driver of the victims' car, the anchorwoman's husband, said
he had refused to stop for men who identified themselves as police
because he was afraid they were robbers. He said he had $12,000 in
the car.
   The four arrested officers told police they had mistaken the
victims' car for a similar car carrying suspected narcotics
traffickers who engaged in a shootout with police earlier Saturday.
   The officers were accused of killing Linda Bejarano, 28,
anchorwoman for station XHIJ in Juarez; her mother-in-law, Lucrecia
Martinez de Gomez, 58; and a family friend, Carlos Alfonso Garcia,
25. Station officials said Ms. Bejarano was three months' pregnant.
She had two daughters.
   Ms. Bejarano's husband and co-anchor, Manuel Gomez Martinez,
said he was driving the car but escaped injury by lying on the
floor.
   The attorney general suspended Joaquin Salvador Galvan as head
of the Federal Judicial Police here.
   Garcia said the three city officers were ``madrinas,''
underlings who work illegally for members of the elite federal
force.
   The practice, illegal because the city officers are not sworn as
federal agents, gives the madrinas the thrill of working with a
federal officer, who benefits from their unpaid assistance.
   Authorities said evidence indicated the killings were the result
of mistaken identity, and not because Gomez and Ms. Bejarano were
journalists.
   In the last six years, there have been more than 20 cases of
unsolved murders of Mexican journalists. Journalist groups allege
that at least some of the reporters were killed in revenge for
their work or to silence them.
   In an emotional phone call to the attorney general, Gomez raised
the possibility that he might have been targeted by drug
traffickers for some of his work. But neither anchor was known for
exposing drug traffickers or government corruption.
   Corruption allegedly is rife in all levels of Mexico's police
forces and was a major issue in the recent national election, won
by the long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party despite a
record vote for the opposition.
   Transit police in Juarez routinely solicit bribes from Americans
in exchange for not writing traffic tickets. Immigration officials
have been accused of setting up fake checkpoints to shake down
tourists.
   State and federal judicial police often are rumored to accept
money from narcotics traffickers in exchange for protection.
   Gomez said the assailants shouted from their car that they were
with the federal judicial police and ordered him to stop. He said
he didn't stop at first because he was afraid they would search his
car and steal $12,000 in cash he had collected for doing publicity
work for a traveling circus.
   He told police that he stopped when the men struck his car with
theirs. Then the men got out with automatic weapons and, without a
word, opened fire.
   Carlos Armendariz, the new head of the Federal Judicial Police
in Juarez, said the four officers had mistaken Gomez' car for one
involved in a shootout with federal police about two hours earlier
25 miles south of Juarez.
   Federal police had an anonymous tip that the car was carrying 80
kilograms, or 176 pounds, of cocaine, Armendariz said.
   Saturday afternoon, police found an abandoned, bullet-riddled
and blood-splattered car matching the shootout car's description
with 38 kilograms, or 83 pounds, of cocaine in the trunk, state
judicial police commander Ramon Olivas said.

<TEXT>
   A heavy barrage of rockets on Sunday
slammed into the southern edge of the Afghan capital, hitting Kabul
Airport, a Western diplomat said. Newspapers reported the shelling
of a Pakistani border village.
   Pakistani daily newspapers reported Sunday that six people were
killed and 21 injured when the Afghan army shelled the border
village of Chaman, in southwestern Pakistan, on Saturday.
   One newspaper report said the Pakistani army returned fire. The
Pakistani government made no immediate comment on that report.
   No immediate word of casualties was given after Sunday's rocket
attack on Kabul, blamed on anti-government guerrillas.
   The diplomat's report followed near-daily rocket attacks blamed
on the guerrillas. During the past three weeks, 130 rockets have
blasted the capital, killing 80 people and injuring more than 100,
state-run Radio Kabul said Sunday.
   The latest attack also came after Pakistan accused the Soviet
Union of bringing troops back into Afghanistan to shore up
struggling government forces around Kabul. The Soviets have agreed
to withdraw all of their estimated 115,000 troops by Feb. 15,
leaving 50,000 government soldiers to fight about 200,000
Pakistani-backed guerrillas.
   The Western diplomat in Pakistan, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, also said at least four people died in a late-night
rocket attack on Kabul Friday.
   During an address on Radio Kabul on Sunday to mark the Islamic
holiday of Eid al-Adha, Afghan President Najib said another rocket
attack Saturday killed several people.
   He blamed the attack on Afghan guerrillas who have been fighting
the communist government in Kabul for the past 10 years.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, also reported four people
were killed and nine injured when rockets blasted the eastern city
of Jalalabad on Friday.
   Chaman, where Pakistan newspapers reported the shelling, lies
about five miles from the Afghan town of Spinbuldak, which rebels
had surrounding.
   Quoting official sources, a Pakistani opposition paper, The
Frontier Post, said Pakistan army troops returned fire.
   Najib said the Soviet troop withdrawal, provided for in an
accord in April, was progressing, but he said stepped-up guerrilla
attacks were ``obstructing'' it. He did not elaborate.
   The Soviet Union denied Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq's charge
that the troop withdrawal had stopped and 10,000 soldiers were
recalled from the Soviet Union to prop up the defense of Kabul,
Radio Kabul said.
   Quoting Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, Radio
Kabul said Sunday that 35,000 troops have left Afghanistan.
Akhromeyev said half of an estimated 115,000 troops will be out by
Aug. 15.
   Meanwhile, another Soviet military officer, breaking with
Moscow's official line, said he doubted the Afghan army can survive
after Soviet troops leave. He predicted Islamic fundamentalists
will gain power.
   Maj. Gen. Kim M. Tsagolov, who served as a Soviet adviser to
Afghan troops, also told the weekly Ogonyok magazine in its July 30
issue that Afghanistan's governing party is hopelessly disorganized
and has bungled opportunities to make peace with insurgents.

   Violent storms swept through districts east and

   Andre Gaudre, 53, was killed on a road near the town of Rethel,
110 miles east of Paris, Saturday night, said a local police
spokesman. Gaudre's wife, Christiane, 52, was hospitalized with
minor injuries, the spokesman said.
   Police officials said workers were trying to restore electricity
to about 5,000 homes in the area.
   Hail and high winds damaged a crowded shopping center Saturday
in Torcy, 20 miles east of Paris. Two people were seriously injured
and 33 others were slightly hurt, according to fire officials in
Torcy, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Witnesses said hail the ``size of small eggs'' damaged the roof
and broke windows at the Continent shopping complex. Most of the
injured were hit by flying glass.
   The shopping center was evacuated and fire officials said water
threatened to cause the roof to collapse.
   In the town of Evry, 20 miles south of Paris, three people were
seriously injured and 25 others suffered minor injuries in traffic
accidents caused by the storm, fire officials said.

   President Reagan returned to the nation's
capital Sunday after a week-long vacation at his mountaintop ranch
north in California and prepared to deal with the drought, aid to
Nicaraguan rebels and the fall political campaign.
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan were joined on the
trip back to Washington aboard Air Force One by Secretary of the
Treasury James A. Baker III.
   Baker spoke Saturday night at a fund-raising reception in Los
Angeles for the re-election campaign of Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   An administration official dismissed speculation that Baker's
presence signaled any immediate announcement of his resignation to
run Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign.
   ``Essentially he is hitching a ride,'' the official said,
speaking on condition he not be identified. . ``The fund-raiser had
been scheduled for some time and he is hitching a ride back on Air
Force One.''
   Another official, speaking on the same condition, said an
announcement of Baker's plans is expected early in August. Bush is
as near certainty as can be to win the Republican presidential
nomination at the GOP convention that opens in New Orleans Aug. 15.
   On board Air Force One en route to Washington, reporters asked
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater about Baker's plans and
were told he did not know, that Reagan and Baker had only a ``very
brief chat. They chatted in the hallway.''
   ``He's still treasury secretary, put it that way,'' said
Fitzwater.
   When reporters sent Baker a note asking them to come back and
talk to them about the question, he replied with a note in a folder
that contained a dollar bill. Baker wrote, ``Please note the title
under the signature.''
   The title under Baker's signature on currency is secretary of
the treasury.
   Leaving the airplane at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, a
reporter asked Baker, ``Can you share the news with us?'' He
replied, ``There's no news to share.''
   The president has summoned Republican congressional leaders to
the White House on Tuesday for a meeting that officials say will
focus on plans for the remaining six months of the Reagan
presidency, including discussions of assistance for the rebels
against Nicaragua's Marxist-led government.
   Kenneth M. Duberstein, the president's chief of staff, told
reporters in Santa Barbara that in addition to the congressional
leadership meeting, he will be consulting with administration
officials and Reagan supporters outside government during the week
to develop ``plans and strategies to get things done.''
   Fitzwater said Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng will report
to the president during the week on a trip of 10 drought-stricken
states that he and other government officials have completed.
   Also coming up during the week is a midyear review of the
budget. Fitzwater said he did not think it would affect the
availability of funds for drought relief.
   Fitzwater said Reagan is committed to making at least two
campaign trips a week on behalf of Republican candidates after
September, would speak at two Republican fund-raising events in Los
Angeles while in California for another ranch vacation next month
and might make at least one campaign appearance before he leaves
for the New orleans convention on Aug. 14.
   The president devoted his weekly radio address Saturday to an
attack on the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, where he
said speakers repeated ``the same sad song they sang four years
ago.''
   He did not, as he had in some speeches, specifically attack
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, nor did he mention
Bush, whom he has often lavishly praised.
   The vice president will have lunch with the president on
Thursday.

   Thunderstorms developed Sunday over parts of the drought-plagued
Upper Midwest, and parts of the Northeast got heavy rain before
unsettled weather moved off the Atlantic Coast.
   A cold front extending from northeastern Minnesota to western
Kansas triggered scattered thunderstorms over northern Iowa and
central Wisconsin.
   A strong thunderstorm moved through the area of the area of
Oshkosh, Wis., with wind gusting to 65 mph.
   Showers were scattered over the upper Ohio Valley and the lower
Great Lakes region.
   Much of the rain that had plagued parts of the Atlantic Coast
for several days moved off the Coast after leaving heavy 24-hour
rain amounts, including more than 4 inches at Putnam, Conn., the
National Weather Service said. In Massachusetts, more than 2 inches
of rain fell in a 6-hour period early Sunday.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered over eastern
Colorado, northern New Mexico, Oklahoma and northern Texas.
   And thunderstorms, some with locally heavy rain, were scattered
over Florida.
   Monroe, La., posted a record low temperature Sunday morning of
63 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 60
degrees at Arcata and Crescent City, Calif., to 106 at Needles,
Calif. Sunday morning's low was 36 at Jackson, Wyo.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
over Florida, the coast of North Carolina and New England, and also
ahead of a cold front over Michigan, eastern Wisconsin, Illinois,
Indiana, the lower Missouri Valley and Oklahoma. Scattered
thunderstorms were forecast over eastern Colorado and widely
scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast over northeastern
Arizona.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted from Maine to northern Wisconsin
and northeastern Minnesota; in the 70s and 80s along the Pacific
Coast; in the 80s over the northern and central Plains, across most
of the upper and middle Mississippi Valley, the Ohio Valley and
from the Carolinas and the middle Atlantic Coast states to southern
sections of New England; between 100 and 105 from northern
California to western Idaho; between 100 and 115 over the desert
Southwest and the valleys of California; and in the 90s over most
of the rest of the nation.

   Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinians during
fighting in the occupied West Bank Sunday and 1,500 policemen
patrolled Jerusalem to prevent battles between Moslems and Jews
celebrating religious observances.
   Police blocked right-wing Jewish extremists from marching
through the Arab quarter of Jerusalem's Old City and arrested two
Israelis.
   Reinforced police were stationed in Jerusalam to prevent trouble
on the coinciding Jewish and Moslem holidays centered on the Temple
Mount.
   In the West Bank town of Qabatiya, Israeli troops shot and
killed one Palestinian and wounded three others, the army said
without identifying the victims. Israel army radio said one Israeli
military officer was injured during the clash.
   A Palestinian died at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital after being
shot at least twice during a demonstration in the West Bank town of
Beit Jala, the army and hospital officials said. The hospital
sources said the 38-year-old man tried to throw a brick at Israeli
soldiers.
   The deaths raised to 233 the known number of Palestinians killed
since they began an uprising Dec. 8. in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and the Gaza Strip. Four Israelis also have been slain in the
violence.
   In the Gaza Strip, 25 Palestinians were wounded by beatings by
Israeli troops or by rubber bullets fired by the soldiers during a
series of clashes, Gaza hospital officials said.
   The army imposed or extended curfews on eight cities and refugee
camps in Gaza and the West Bank, confining about 250,000
Palestinians to their homes.
   Increased police security was mounted in the Old City, the
walled section of Arab east Jeruslem, as Moslems and Jews
celebrated major ceremonies.
   Israel captured east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
after the 1967 Middle East War. It later annexed east Jerusalem.
   Moslems prayed on the Temple Mount to mark Eid al-Ahda, or the
``Feast of Sacrifice,'' which commemorates Abraham's preparations
to sacrifice his son at God's instructions. At the last moment the
son was spared and instead a sheep was sacrificed.
   Jews marked Tisha B'Av, the anniversary or the destruction by
Roman troops of the Holy Jewish Temple about 2,000 years ago.
   More than 100 Jewish militants who demand Israeli control over
the Temple Mount held a prayer vigil at its gates but were barred
by police from entering. Jews can visit the area individually but
under an arrangement with Moslem religious authorities they are not
allowed to pray on the Temple Mount.
   Police later barred the group from entering the adjacent Moslem
quarter after they refused to abandon the Israeli flags they were
carrying.
   But about 20 followers of the right-wing Tehiya Party and the
militantly anti-Arab Kach movement managed to slip through the
police lines and marched into the district with Israeli flags
before being stopped by police.
   Israel radio said armed Kach members circulated through the Old
City and police said two were arrested. The Kach movement, headed
by U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane, calls for the ouster of Arabs from
Israeli-held territory.
   Few tourists visited the Old City and other sections of east
Jerusalem.
   ``There is a tremendous police presence here, and we are a
little worried about getting caught in something,'' said Tom
McNeely, a 47-year-old lawyer from Charlotte, N.C., as he and his
wife walked along Jerusalem's Via Dolorosa.

<HEAD>Stepfather Sentenced To Six Years In Prison After Girl Recants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINTER GARDEN, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have refused to grant
immunity from perjury charges to a 14-year-old girl who recanted
sex abuse charges against her stepfather before he was sentenced to
six years in prison.
   The girl now says she lied two years ago when she initially told
of the alleged abuse and lied again in April before the jury that
convicted her stepfather because she was afraid of going to jail
for perjury.
   She is working with her mother to get her stepfather a new trial
by raising money to hire a lawyer for an appeal. The mother and
daughter publicized their cause over the weekend by being
interviewed by The Orlando Sentinel, but the identities of the two
adults and the girl were not revealed in keeping with state law.
   Prosecutors contend the mother indirectly pressured the girl
into recanting.
   Assistant State Attorney Michelle Heller said the reason for
refusing to grant her immunity, however, is that to do so would
condone lying. The girl either lied when she made up the charges,
or would have been lying when she recanted, the prosecutor said.
   ``It undermines the whole system,'' Ms. Heller said. ``Why
should we say it's OK to lie? It's not our policy to grant immunity
to people you think are telling lies under that immunity.''
   Judge Gary Formet, in what he called one of the toughest
decisions he has made in nine years on the bench, denied the
34-year-old man's motion for a new trial. And he sentenced him to
six years in prison on charges of lewd assault, although he had
been informed the girl had recanted.
   The mother steadfastly denies pressuring her daughter to recant,
and the daughter said the only pressure came from prosecutors
angered by her decision to recant.
   The case began when the girl broke down in tears to her
elementary school teacher in March 1986, right after a police
officer had talked to her class about sexual abuse by parents and
relatives.
   Now she says she made up the story because she wanted more time
with her mother. ``It seemed like my mom paid a lot more attention
when he was gone,'' the girl said.
   The girl met privately with the prosecutor, Ms. Heller, on June
1, the day of the sentencing, and told her she was lying.
   ``I was looking right at her,'' the girl said. ``She said, `You
couldn't have lied that long.' She said, `You're lying, you're
lying' and hit the table. She scared me.''
   Ms. Heller disagreed with the girl's version.
   ``I never yelled at her,'' Heller said. ``I was trying to get
her to explain why she waited until the sentencing to tell me. If I
seemed angry, it wasn't at her. I was upset that this was
happening.''

<HEAD>Gujarat State Police Replaced By Army And Paramilitary Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gujarat state's 59,000-member police
force has been disarmed following a union dispute and was replaced
Sunday by army and federal paramilitary troops, government
television reported.
   It said 54 policemen were dismissed for ``high indiscipline''
and an unspecified number of other officers were arrested for
indiscipline or criminal activities.
   Among those arrested was Ashok Bhatt, the leader of one of the
western state's seven police unions, according to the report. It
said four of the unions, including Bhatt's, were ordered disbanded
and the police force ``has been disarmed.''
   The United News of India and the Press Trust of India news
agencies said the army was officially activated late Sunday in the
industrial city of Ahmedabad, 18 miles south of the state capital
of Gandhinagar.
   They reported paramilitary police were deployed in other major
cities in Gujarat and ordered to take control of all of the police
armories.
   UNI said about 3,000 dismissed policemen and their supporters
gathered in Ahmedabad, a city of nearly 2 million people, to
protest the action by the federal government in New Delhi.
   It said paramilitary units using wooden staves and tear gas
dispersed the crowd and two people suffered minor injuries during
scuffles.
   Bhatt has been accused of making speeches critical of President
Ramaswami Venkataraman.
   The Press Trust of India also said he had urged Gujarat state's
reserve policemen to refuse temporary duty in Punjab, the northern
state where militant Sikhs have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland since 1982.
   Both news agencies said army troops held ceremonial ``flag
marches'' in several major cities, including Ahmedabad, to display
their presence.
   Gujarat's chief minister, Amarsinh Chaudhary, took the action
against the police unions two days after returning from talks with
federal officials in New Delhi.
   He was quoted by the Press Trust of India as saying that he
moved against police ``errors'' and said most of India's 22 states
are opposed to police unions.
   India has a federal form of government, with the states having
their own governments led by a chief minister and police forces,
but the central government has overiding authority.

   There's a there there now.
   And it's a sculpture.
   A 17-foot tall swirl of metal slats, titled ``There,'' was
placed in City Square on Saturday in an attempt to discount author
Gertrude Stein's famous remark after returning to her hometown,
``There's no there there.''
   Officials of the city, which has long been treated like it was
San Francisco's ugly stepsister, hope the $95,000 artwork instills
civic pride.
   ``It adds to the city's image, but it's not going to solve the
problem. That can't be done with a sculpture,'' said Glenn Jones,
owner of The Candy Man, a new store in the heart of the city's
redevelopment efforts.
   Born in Oakland, Stein left in 1891 at the age of 17. Visiting
the city 44 years later, Stein noted that it had changed beyond
recognition.
   Stein, who died in 1946, used a writing style that relied on
repeating words to make a point. She often left out punctuation,
which she believed got in the way of the reader. She also wrote,
``A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.''

   Sarah Deacon's father often tried to amuse
his children by pouring pancake batter into the shapes of
dinosaurs, ducks and mice, but the results usually were
unidentifiable blobs.
   So 9-year-old Sarah came up with what she calls ``Funcake
Pancake Molds.''
   Besides solving her father's culinary problem, Sarah's idea has
won the regional portion of the ``Invent America'' competition.
   The contest, sponsored by the U.S. Patent Model Foundation, was
created to encourage creative thinking and problem-solving skills
in America's schools. Sarah's four pancake molds _ made of
lightweight aluminum in the shapes of a duck, bunny, mouse and
dinosaur _ will go up against the inventions of eight other
third-graders at the national competition in Washington next week.
   Her entry form says the molds ``make breakfast less boring and
more fun.''
   Sarah said she might continue inventing as a hobby, but she has
other career plans.
   ``I'd rather be a famous soccer player,'' she said.

   Monuments honoring Gen. Douglas MacArthur
may soon be springing up around the world, offspring of a giant,
500-year-old pine tree named after the World War II hero.
   The U.S. Forest Service and two men from Louisville, Ky., hope
to use seeds from the cones to start new trees and plant them near
the original in northern Wisconsin, and in places of historical
importance to MacArthur.
   The MacArthur pine was recognized as a champion white pine by
the American Foresty Association in 1945 and reigned as the
country's champion white pine for years until a storm blew off 40
feet from the 140-foot tall tree.
   Foresters said they are uncertain how much longer the tree will
continue to produce pine cones with the seeds for new trees. Last
year, the old pine only had a few cones, said Stan Lemaster, who
with Theodore Klein, has made a hobby of growing seedlings and
cuttings from historic trees.
   Lemaster said last week that he wants to provide seedlings from
the MacArthur pine to places important to the World War II general
such as Australia, Japan and the Philipines as well the military
academy at West Point, N.Y., and Little Rock, Ark., MacArthur's
birthplace.
   ``I would just love to propagate it,'' said Lemaster, who has
planted 316 trees in 122 cities in the 50 states, England, Canada,
Japan and Yugoslavia over the past 22 years. ``It would be one of
my favorite trees.''

<TEXT>
   A British news agency said
Sunday that a judge whose home was attacked last year may have been
the target of an Irish Republican Army bomb that killed three
people.
   The Press Association said sources, whom it did not identify,
believed the IRA's attack Saturday was meant for Judge Ian Higgins
of north Belfast, one of two Roman Catholic high court judges in
Northern Ireland.
   Police declined to comment on the report, which the news agency
attributed to sources in Belfast and Dublin, in the Republic of
Ireland.
   Higgins was returning with his wife and daughter from a vacation
in the United States.
   The IRA said it accidentally set off a bomb killing Robert James
Hanna of Hillsborough, his wife, and their 6-year-old child. The
family from Northern Ireland was also returning from a U.S. trip.
   The outlawed group, fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, said the bomb detonated prematurely. But it said earlier
the attack was meant for British soldiers.
   In February 1987, Higgins' home in Belfast was hit with gunfire
and rockets. Higgins escaped injury.
   He arrived at Dublin Airport on Saturday morning and was
traveling under Irish police escort on the same road to Belfast
where the explosion occurred. But he and his family reached the
border about a half hour after the explosion near Newry, about a
mile into Northern Ireland, blew up the Hanna's vehicle.
   Authorities said they did not know where the judge and his
family or the Hannas had been vacationing in the United States.

   A 16-year-old girl shot and killed her
fiance in the main square of this small Sicilian town after he
broke off their engagement, police said Sunday.
   Giuseppina Rindone shot 21-year-old Giuseppe Porrovecchio Friday
in front of her father Alberto, who had given her the pistol,
police said.
   Alberto Rindone, who works in West Germany, returned to Riesi
last week, apparently because his wife, Emma Valenzola, told him
the engagement had been broken off, police said.
   ``Giuseppina is a good girl,'' the Italian news agency ANSA
quoted Mrs. Valenzola as saying, ``and her honor is worth running
even the risk of life in prison.''
   The girl and her father were immediately detained.
   ``We can't believe it is simply a crime of honor,'' said a
police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``That's why we
are investigating on other grounds. People are not so old-fashioned
here, and there have not been expressions of solidarity toward the
girl so far.''

   Police and an estimated 1,000 supporters
of an opposition politican battled at Taiwan's airport Sunday after
authorities refused entry to an exiled dissident who seeks
independence for Taiwan.
   Officials said two reporters were hospitalized with head
injuries after they were attacked by people in the crowd who
apparently thought the journalists were plainclothes policemen. No
other casualties were reported.
   Police said Chen Wan-chen, 38, who has lived in the United
States since 1979 and owns a bookstore in Los Angeles, tried to
enter Taiwan aboard a Singapore Airlines flight from the United
States but was detected and forced to leave on the same plane en
route to Singapore.
   They said Ms. Chen was denied entry because she might endanger
Taiwan's internal security and she did not have an entry visa.
   The crowd had gathered at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport,
31 miles west of Taipei, for the arrival of Hung Chi-chang, a
leader of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party who had
visited the Philippines and the United States.
   Party officials said Hung's supporters wanted to protect him
from possible arrest. Authorities have accused Hung of being
involved in an anti-government demonstration last May in which
about 200 people were injured.
   Ms. Chen, wearing a wig and using an altered Taiwan passport,
was on the same flight as Hung, but Hung and officials of his party
said they did not know she was aboard. When reports spread at the
airport that Ms. Chen would not be allowed to enter the country,
people in the crowd became angry and attacked police, officials
said.
   The Nationalist Chinese established their government in Taiwan
after they were defeated in 1949 in China's civil war by the
Communists.
   The Communists claim Taiwan is a Chinese province and both they
and the Nationalists are opposed to an independent Taiwan.

   Christina Savalas, an artist whose work
received international exhibition and who was the mother of actor
Telly Savalas, has died of natural causes. She was 84.
   Mrs. Savalas died at St. Joseph Medical Center on Saturday
night, said Mike Mamakos, Telly Savalas' publicist.
   Born in Sparta, Greece, Mrs. Savalas was a teen-ager when she
migrated to Long Island, N.Y., where she met and married a fellow
immigrant, Nicholas Savalas. He died 25 years ago.
   As an artist, Mrs. Savalas specialized in portraits ``that most
people described as Picassolike,'' Mamakos said. Her paintings were
exhibited in several large cities, including New York, Los Angeles
and Athens, he said.
   ``Scores of her paintings are also in private collections
throughout the United States and Europe,'' he added.
   Her most famous son, Telly Savalas, became ``Kojak'' to millions
of television viewers in 1973. That series won Savalas an Emmy, but
he has also appeared in more than 60 movies and was nominated for
an Academy Award for his role in ``Birdman of Alcatraz.''
   Mrs. Savalas is survived by two other sons, Ted and Gus; a
daughter, Katherine; 22 grandchildren; and seven
great-grandchildren. Another son, George, died several years ago.
He played the character Stavros in the ``Kojak'' series.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush wooed women voters Sunday with an
ambitious child-care proposal, as yet another poll pointed up his
need to close the ``gender gap.'' And Democrat Michael Dukakis with
his running mate Lloyd Bentsen wrapped up their first campaign
swing as political partners.
   Both presidential contenders faced some vocal opposition on the
campaign trail.
   Bush won praise for a $2.2 billion child-care plan he unveiled
before a group of professional women. But when he finished
speaking, many in the audience broke into chants of ``E-R-A'' _ a
reference to the Equal Rights Amendment, which the vice president
opposes.
   And Dukakis, who supports abortion rights, was heckled by
anti-abortion protesters in St. Louis, where he attended church
services.
   The Democrats, meanwhile, were looking back with satisfaction on
their national convention, which ended last week, while the
Republicans looked ahead to theirs, three weeks away.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air
Force One en route to Washington on Sunday that President Reagan
may make a Midwestern campaign trip on Bush's behalf between now
and the convention.
   Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, promised at least one
piece of GOP convention drama, pledging that the vice president
would not unveil his choice of a running mate until next month in
New Orleans.
   ``He's going to keep his own counsel on it, and he's going to
let us all know at the convention,'' Atwater said Sunday in an
interview on CBS' ``Face The Nation.''
   ``I think that will be very exciting and very dramatic,'' he
said.
   The Republicans say their convention preparations are proceeding
on schedule, but local fund-raisers in New Orleans acknowledged
they would have to work hard to hunt up the cash for facilities and
services the city has promised to provide during the gathering.
   Ron Jones, heading up the convention city's fund drive, said
fund raising was running ``maybe a little behind'' but that the
money should be on hand before the convention opens Aug. 15.
   Republicans and Democrats were united in one respect _ the
amount of time they were devoting to talk of party unity.
   Pat Robertson, Bush's onetime rival for the GOP nomination,
urged his supporters to rally behind the vice president. The
television evangelist also said his flock wasn't out to start any
floor fights at the Republican convention.
   However, Robertson told a Republican rally in Charleston, S.C.
on Saturday that he would like to see a plank calling for the
nomination of conservative candidates at all levels of the federal
judiciary.
   The Democrats, meanwhile, were giving themselves good reviews.
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Democrats came out of their
convention well positioned for a big win in the fall.
   ``It will be one of the great defeats in modern history for the
Republicans,'' Cuomo said Sunday on ``Face the Nation.'' The
governor, who got more attention as a non-candidate than some of
the Democratic candidates did, said he would campaign for Dukakis
``wherever he wants me.''
   As for the candidates themselves, Bush was accompanied by former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole as he addressed the
National Convention of Business and Professional Women's Clubs in
Albuquerque on Sunday. His child-care proposal was favorably
received by the group.
   The proposal, initially affecting only low-income families,
would eventually apply to all families with children under age 4 in
which at least one parent worked, he said.
   ``This is one of his first concrete gestures'' toward women, the
group's president, Beth Wray, said afterward.
   A number of surveys have suggested that Dukakis is better
regarded by female voters than is Bush. The latest poll, by
Newsweek magazine, said Bush trailed Dukakis by 17 points overall _
55 percent to 38 percent _ and that Dukakis' strength was due in
part to the backing of 58 percent of the female voters.
   The survey of 948 registered voters, conducted July 21-22, had a
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   Dukakis, attending Sunday church services with Bentsen in St.
Louis, faced anti-abortion protesters outside. The governor calls
abortion a ``difficult, very serious, very important ethical and
moral judgment'' that a woman must make for herself.
   In St. Louis, Dukakis and Bentsen were introduced by Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who had also sought the Democratic
nomination.
   The Democratic nominee and his running mate got off to a running
start after the convention that anointed them. They visited five
states, including the big battlegrounds of California and Texas.
   Dukakis returned to Boston on Sunday night, where he was
welcomed by about 150 people at Logan International Airport.
Bentsen, meanwhile, flew back to Washington.
   Bush returned to Washington on Sunday night after a five-day
campaign swing that took him to eight states.
   Treasury Secretary James Baker, who was in California for a
weekend fund-raising event, accompanied Reagan on his return flight
from California on Sunday, but an administration official dismissed
speculation that Baker's presence signaled any immediate
announcement of his resignation to run the Bush campaign.
   Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, Baker had ``a very brief
chat'' with Reagan and added: ``He's still treasury secretary, put
it that way.''
   When reporters aboard the plane sent Baker a note asking them to
come back and talk to him about the matter, he replied with a note
with a folder that contained a dollar bill.
   ``Please note the title under the signature,'' Baker wrote. That
title, of course, is secretary of the treasury.

   Hundreds of Roman Catholics went to
Maputo's airport on Saturday and again Sunday to welcome home the

city's international airport, just as they had done on Saturday,
and with the same disappointing result,'' AIM reported. The plane
had been scheduled to arrive Saturday morning, but AIM said the
flight was postponed for ``technical reasons.'' It did not
elaborate.
   Dos Santos was to have presided at a Mass Sunday in the Maputo
Cathedral, his first since Pope John Paul II appointed him
cardinal, and various celebrations had been planned over the
weekend.

<HEAD>Report Two Americans Charged In Liberian Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberia's offical news agency said
Sunday that two Americans have confessed they participated in a
plot to overthrow the government of President Samuel Doe.
   The Liberian News Agency said James Bush, 40, a retired U.S.
Army sergeant, and William Elmer Curtis, 45, made the confessions
Saturday night in the presence of U.S. Embassy officials.
   The agency identified the U.S. diplomats as Keith Wauchupe, the
charge d'affaires, and consular officer Penny McMurty. Neither
could be reached for comment Sunday.
   In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department said no one
was available for comment.
   The news agency did not give the hometowns or any other details
about Bush and Curtis.
   The two are accused of participating in the invasion on July 13
of Liberia, the West African nation founded in 1847 by former
American slaves.
   Doe has said the invading force was led by his former second in
command, Maj. Gen. J. Nicholas Podier Jr., and it launched its
attack from the Ivory Coast, Liberia's eastern neighbor.
   Podier and an undisclosed number of his men were killed during a
firefight at the border between his band and Liberian security
forces.
   It was known that security forces captured some of the invaders,
but until Sunday's report the government had not released any names.
   The invaders crossed into Liberia in Nimba county, 350 miles
north of Monrovia.
   The news agency said Bush and Curtis were arrested at a security
checkpoint in the county near the town of Ganta. It did not say
whether the two had participated in the gun battle.
   Bush and Curtis said they were introduced to Podier in Abidjan,
the capital of the Ivory Coast, according to the agency.
   It said Curtis agreed to join the plot after he was promised
that if it succeeded, he would be given exclusive rights to mine
gold and diamonds in Liberia.
   Both men were quoted by the agency as saying they participated
in a series of meetings at Abidjan hotels to plan the invasion.
   Podier was one of 17 enlisted men and non-commissioned officers
led by then-Master Sgt. Doe who seized control of Liberia in an
April 12, 1980 coup. President William R. Tolbert was killed.
   After the coup, Doe established the People's Redemption Council,
which ruled by decree until 1985 elections returned Liberia to
civilian rule with Doe as president.
   Podier was vice head-of-state until 1984 when he was fired after
being accused of plotting against Doe. In 1986 he went into exile
in the Ivory Coast.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday that
he hopes the ``historic mission'' of a six-member Israeli
delegation to Moscow would lead to the resumption of Israeli-Soviet
ties severed in 1967.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the trip would be a landmark
in Israeli-Soviet relations.
   Shamir heads the conservative Likud bloc and Peres the socialist
Labor Party. The fractious coalition has governed Israel since 1984
when neither party gained a majority in the election.
   Shamir and Peres conducted separate briefings for the consular
group that will leave Tuesday for the Netherlands. The delegates
are to receive Soviet visas at The Hague on Wednesday and depart
for Moscow the next day. The Netherlands represents Israeli
interests in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union cut diplomatic relations with the Jewish state
after the 1967 Middle East War.
   Shamir aide Avi Pazner quoted the prime minister as saying he
hoped the ``historic mission ... would lead to the process of
normalization in the Israeli-Soviet relations.''
   It will be the first visit to the Soviet Union by an official
Israeli diplomatic group to Moscow in more than 20 years.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said Peres discussed with
the delegates the political changes initiated by Soviet leader
Mikail S. Gorbachev and noted that the Kremlin has recently allowed
thousands of Soviet Jews to visit their relatives in Israel.
   Liel reported Peres said there are as many as 2,000 Soviet
Jewish visitors now in Israel.
   The Kremlin has allowed increased Jewish emigration, with 1,470
Soviet Jews permitted to leave in June _ the sixth straight rise in
the monthly total.
   According to the Geneva-based Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration, a total of 6,017 Soviet Jews have emigrated this year
compared to 8,011 during all of 1987.
   Last year an eight-member Soviet consular delegation visited
Israel to survey Russian property and meet with Soviet citizens
living in Israel. Israel allowed the visit on condition that the
Soviets reciprocate.
   The Soviet group is still in Israel. Despite its limited task,
Israeli officials have expressed hope it would become a permanent
mission.
   Israel radio said the Israeli group going to Moscow is headed by
diplomat Meron Gordon.

   Heavy rains accompanied by hail flooded wide
areas of northwestern China, collapsing thousands of homes and
killing 54 people, an official report said Sunday.
   The storm was the latest in a series of weather disasters in
China that have claimed nearly 600 lives in the past week.
   Up to 5.6 inches of rain fell in just over two hours Saturday in
three counties of Gansu province, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   It reported that large areas of farmland were flooded and
thousands of mud houses and cave homes, typical to the region,
collapsed.
   The brief report did not say if the reported victims were killed
by the collapsing homes.
   In Xifeng City, one of the hardest-hit areas, 730 homes
collapsed and shops and warehouses were flooded, Xinhua said.
   Twenty deaths were reported from Typhoon Warren, which swept
into southeastern Guangdong province on Tuesday with winds of up to
80 mph.
   Meanwhile, a drought and heat wave in central China have claimed
nearly 500 lives.

<TEXT>
   Wiring insulation has been implicated
in fires in at least 12 military and commercial aircraft models,
but the hazard may actually be much more widespread, according to a
published report.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, in stories published Sunday and in
an early Monday edition, said the Air Force was slow to notify its
flight crews about dangers associated with the insulation, called
Kapton, under certain conditions.
   Kapton also was used on the space shuttle, and may have caused a
fire during maintenance in 1983 that wasn't blamed on insulation at
the time, the newspaper said.
   The Navy banned Kapton in 1986 after documenting in laboratory
tests that it can explode in flames and disable crucial
flight-control systems. The Air Force restricts Kapton use only in
high-vibration areas of new aircraft and recently issued a ban on
its use in repairs.
   The Air Force contends that the conditions necessary for such an
explosion to occur rarely exist except in laboratory tests and that
it is impossible to determine whether the insulation was to blame
for electrical fires in years gone by.
   Virtually all contractors who provide U.S. military aircraft to
the Air Force use Kapton extensively, the newspaper said. No known
deaths have been caused by insulation-related aircraft fires
through almost two decades of the insulation's use in more than 50
kinds of aircraft.
   The newspaper reviewed 265 field reports dealing with electrical
problems on the Air Force F-16 and found at least 45 instances
between 1978 and 1986 of wire fires or severe arcing. Included are
six in-flight emergencies and two incidents considered potentially
life-threatening by the Air Force and General Dynamics, maker of
the F-16.
   The single-engine fighters, which rely on electrical impulses to
control their flight rather than mechanical wires and pulleys, each
contains 10 miles of Kapton-coated wire, more than 85 percent of
the aircraft's wiring.
   Navy laboratory studies in 1984 and 1985 found that Kapton, a
carbon-based film, can explode under certain conditions when
exposed to an electrical arc.
   The heat of the arc causes the insulation to carbonize _
instantly deteriorate into a charry substance _ and form a
conductive path for the arc to spread to adjacent wires in an
instantaneous explosion known as ``flashover,'' or ``arc tracking.''
   Fred Rall Jr., the Air Force's top civilian engineer, said
flashover can only be documented by ``trained experts.''
   Rall warned personnel about Kaptan in a newsletter dated March,
26, 1986, but concluded that it was ``an acceptable aircraft wire
insulation given proper installation and maintenance procedures.''
   Richard Hill, a researcher at the Federal Aviation
Administration's Technical Center in Atlantic City, N.J., said the
agency is considering issuing guidelines on Kapton usage in
commercial aircraft, such as recommending against its use in areas
that are susceptible to moisture.
   ``We do not believe there's enough information that says you
should ban Kapton and take it out of the airplane,'' he said. ``We
do think there is enough of a problem or a potential problem that
we should make some changes.''
   Kapton began to gain popularity in the early and mid-1970s,
first in the military and later in commercial aviation.
   Proponents said Kapton was the perfect insulator, being small
enough to fit into tight spaces on fighter jets, light enough to
save precious fuel on airliners and strong enough, as required by
government specifications, to last ``for the life of the aircraft.''
   But as the insulation was put into service, maintenance crews
initially complained that Kapton was stiff, brittle and fragile and
broke easily when bent. They argued that it was difficult to work
with and required too much ``mothering'' to be practical.
   Jim Harris, a spokesman for E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., which
makes Kapton, contends that any insulation will arc-track in the
presence of conductive fluid.
   Lubert Leger, head of the materials branch for NASA's Johnson
Space Center in Houston, said a 1983 arcing incident aboard the
shuttle Columbia during maintenance may have been initially
misdiagnosed.
   Contractor Rockwell International's investigation of the
incident listed the cause of the fire as ``not apparent,'' but
Leger told the Star-Telegram said it had all the earmarks of a
Kapton-related flashover.
   At least 100 aircraft electrical fires reported over the past 15
years have occurred under circumstances that bear striking
similarities to Kapton failures, aircraft maintenance records and
Navy field studies suggest.
   Records cite initial damage to one or two wires followed by
arcing that spreads the fire to adjacent wires.

   An estimated 40,000
demonstrators formed a 24-mile human chain across a North Sea
island Sunday to protest pollution they blame for killing thousands
of seals.
   The human chain across Sylt, off West Germany's northern state
of Schleswig-Holstein, formed for 15 minutes.
   Speaking later at a demonstration at the Sylt resort community
of Westerland, Schleswig-Holstein Environment Minister Berndt
Heydemann called for stepped-up efforts to protect the North Sea.
   Other demonstrations against North Sea pollution were also held
Sunday in his state.
   Environmentalists blame pollution for a virus that in recent
months killed more than 15,000 seals off Denmark, Sweden, West
Germany and the Netherlands.
   However, many scientists doubt that theory, since waters where
many seals have died are relatively free of pollution.

   Striking workers at 10 San Francisco Bay
area cemeteries said Sunday they would return to work Monday after
accepting an agreement worked out with graveyard owners over the
weekend.
   Up to 800 bodies have been kept in storage because of the
strike, which began May 30.
   Members of the cemetery workers' Local 265 approved a proposed
three-year contract by a 2-1 ratio during voting early Sunday.
   Among other things, the new pact restricts subcontracting. Local
265 President Jose Valdez said that workers will not lose jobs they
previously performed, but subcontractors will perform jobs that
union workers don't have the proper machinery to perform or haven't
done in the past.
   Valdez would not disclose the number of union members voting on
the contract, except to say that ``most of the people were there to
vote.''

   Homosexual teachers should declare their sexual
preference openly and confront those who would drive them from the
public schools, speakers said Sunday at a conference of gay
instructors.
   ``The time is right for us to assert ourselves in the
educational field,'' said Virginia Uribe, a Los Angeles high school
teacher. ``We have so much power if we come out, and we have so
little power if we're not out.''
   That message, coming near the conclusion of Uribe's keynote
address, drew tumultuous applause from about 75 elementary, high
school and college educators at the daylong conference, held in
conjunction with a weeklong Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and
AIDS Forum.
   Other speakers echoed the message of openness, but afterward,
when the group divided into small workshops, boldness gave way to
caution.
   ``To some of us, this is not real,'' said a teacher from a
Kansas elementary school district who didn't want her name
published. ``I'd love to tell my kids that I'm a lesbian, but if I
did, I wouldn't be there Monday.''
   When a young teacher from Ohio asked for advice on whether he
should declare his homosexuality right away or wait until he had
obtained tenure, the answer came in a chorus: ``Get tenure.''
   Warren Blumenfeld, a teacher in the Watertown, Mass., schools,
said he became a better teacher after he disclosed his sexual
orientation.
   ``When I first got out of ed school, I thought I wouldn't say
anything to my students about it,'' he recalled. ``But that drained
me of my energy. When I came out it freed me up to be who I was and
to channel my energy into constructive channels.''
   However, Blumenfeld also cited a 1982 Gallup poll indicating
that 59 percent of Americans felt homosexual educators should be
excluded from public schools.
   The educators were united in asserting that they pose no danger
to students and, in fact, can serve as positive role models.
   ``Homosexuality is not contagious,'' said Blumenfeld. ``Having
an openly gay or lesbian teacher will not make students who are
confused become gay or lesbian.
   ``But what it will do is it will show them that the option is
OK, and if they happen to be gay, it will reduce their isolation.''

   An intercity bus veered off a road
apparently to avoid a collision and overturned in a rural area
Sunday, killing a woman and injuring all 34 others aboard,
authorities said.
   A car apparently was traveling in the wrong lane of the two-lane
highway at the time of the accident, Camden Police Chief John
Rogers said. He said the bus driver, who was among those injured,
swerved off the road to avoid a collision and the other car did not
stop.
   Rosie Gulley, 68, of New York City was killed, said state police
Capt. George Jones in Selma. A spokesman at St. Margaret's Hospital
in Montgomery said the passenger died after being flown there by
helicopter.
   The bus, operated by Mobile-based Colonial Trailways, was
carrying 34 passengers and the driver, state police spokesman Will
Rogers said.
   Frank Smith, supervisor of operations for the 53-year-old
company, said, ``We had some serious injuries. Three or four
(passengers) were transferred to Montgomery,'' the nearest major
city to the isolated area east of the Alabama River where the
accident occurred.
   Some of the passengers suffered chest injuries and at least two
women will require dental treatment, said Arden Chesnut,
administrator of J. Paul Jones Hospital in Camden. She said most of
the injured were treated and released Sunday afternoon.
   Troopers said the accident occurred on Alabama Route 265 about
three miles south of Camden and some 130 miles north of Mobile.
   Smith said the bus was headed from Mobile to New York, and his
company, which operates routes in Alabama and three other states,
was handling the Mobile-Montgomery portion.
   It was the company's first fatal accident, Smith said.

   Gov. Bill Clements was released Sunday
after being hospitalized for five nights following a mild stroke
and said he felt good enough to campaign vigorously for George Bush
for president.
   Asked if his illness had given him a new perspective on life,
the 71-year-old Republican said, ``My perspective hasn't changed
one iota _ beat Dukakis.''
   Clements told reporters in the hospital lobby that he felt
great, adding: ``I don't anticipate that I'm going to curtail my
activities at all. I'll continue to play tennis, I'll continue to
go out to Taos (his vacation home in New Mexico) _ which has a high
altitude _ for vacation periods, I'll continue to have a full
schedule so far as the governor's office is concerned.''
   An attending physician said Clements, was ``in excellent
condition,'' according to Cheryl McEntire, spokeswoman for Seton
Medical Center.
   The governor's release, originally scheduled for Saturday, was
delayed on doctors' orders after they detected a slight
irregularity in Clements' heart rhythm.
   Clements admitted himself to Seton Medical Center on Tuesday
after consulting a physician about a vision problem.
   Dr. David Morris, a heart specialist, and Dr. Jerry Tindel, a
neurologist, said tests indicated that Clements was suffering from
a slight heartbeat irregularity.
   The condition could have caused a tiny blood clot to form in his
heart and pass into his brain, causing the stroke, the doctors said.
   Asked how long it would take for the governor to resume a normal
work day, Clements press secretary Reggie Bashur said, ``Dr. Morris
has indicated it's a matter of several days to a week ....''
   Bashur said doctors had indicated Clements would be ``on some
form of medication for the heart rhythm for an indefinite period of
time.''

<TEXT>
   Archbishop John O'Connor of New
York carried his plea for peace Sunday to the hub of Ireland's
sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, where he said unemployment
will breed more terrorism.
   The cardinal flew to Belfast from Knock, site of the Irish
Republic's most important Roman Catholic shrine. At Knock he prayed
for peace and met relatives of two men imprisoned in connection
with Irish Republican Army bombings.
   Shortly after arriving in Northern Ireland, O'Connor went to
impoverished west Belfast. Stopping amid the garbage and rubble of
the Divis Flats housing project, where unemployment is 86 percent,
he called it ``a Catholic ghetto.''
   ``This grinds into my soul to see this kind of hopelessness that
comes from unemployment. Basically, these kids are growing up with
nothing,'' he said.
   ``Nobody offers them anything, and then the IRA comes along and
offers them status, offers them recognition.'' .
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to unite Northern Ireland, a
British province were Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the
predominantly Catholic Irish Republic.
   Speaking of unemployment, O'Conner said, ``If it doesn't end, it
is just a festering, festering wound, and that is what ultimately
creates violence.''
   The cardinal met several Belfast teen-agers, including
19-year-old Paddy McErlean. The youth's 20-year-old brother,
Thomas, was one of three people killed by a Protestant gunman in
the March 16 Milltown cemetery massacre that prompted O'Connor's
visit.
   Paddy McErlean was asked what could bring peace to the area and
he replied: ``Get the British army out and see what happens. Also
jobs.''
   Earlier in the day, before he said Mass at the Shrine of Our
Lady of Knock, O'Connor met with the wife and mother of two men
imprisoned after they were convicted of being involved in an IRA
campaign to bomb taverns in England in the mid-1970s.
   The women said they told O'Connor their relatives were innocent
and convicted unfairly.
   ``We feel Cardinal O'Connor may well be able to raise this with
President Reagan or whoever succeeds him,'' said Nuala Kelly, a
spokeswoman for the women and coordinator of the Irish Bishops
Commission for Prisoners Overseas.
   Kate McIlkenny, whose husband Richard was convicted in two 1974
bombings in Birmingham that killed 21 people, said of the cardinal,
``He's going to have a chat with some people when he gets back
home.''
   During the Mass, O'Connor spoke of the meetings in his sermon.
He made no mention of the merit of the cases but said he had ``the
great privilege'' of speaking with Lilly Hill, whose son Paul has
served 14 years of a life sentence for 1974 bombings in Guildford.
   O'Connor arrived Friday for his Irish tour and is to leave
Wednesday.

   A chartered bus carrying 46 people to a
family reunion Sunday slammed into a low overhead bridge that
peeled off its roof, toppling luggage onto passengers and injuring
35 people, police said.
   Most of the injured suffered cuts and wounds, said Edison Police
Sgt. Bill Bunting. They were taken to four hospitals.
   The only person admitted was Minnie McCrary, 44, of Norfolk,
Va., who was listed in critical condition with head injuries, said
Robert Loder, a spokesman for John F. Kennedy Hospital in Edison.
   The driver, Sherman Lassiter, 43, of Suffolk, Va., was charged
with careless driving, Bunting said. He said Lassiter, who works
for United Coach Corp. of Suffolk, was exceeding the speed limit
while traveling 35 to 40 mph and failed to observe a sign warning
of low bridge clearance.
   He said other accidents involving buses and trucks have occurred
at the underpass, most involving out of state drivers unfamiliar
with the low bridge and unattentive to a warning sign.
   The force of the collision sheared off most of the bus roof and
sent luggage from overhead racks toppling onto the passengers,
police said. The driver was unhurt, and the injured ranged in age
from 10 months to 60 years old, police said.
   Unlike a bus accident on the Garden State Parkway on Saturday,
in which 42 people were injured, there was no indication the driver
of the bus in Sunday's wreck was in possession of any drug
paraphernalia, Bunting said.
   The driver on Saturday, Annette Smalls, 29, of Newark, N.J., was
arrested after her Gray Lines tour bus, transporting a church group
from New York City to Atlantic City, went off the road and into
some trees, state police said.

   Roman Catholic Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk
returned Sunday night to a Cincinnati hospital where he was to
undergo surgery to repair a ruptured aneurysm at the base of his
brain, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Pilarczyk, 53, head of the Cincinnati archdiocese, suffered a
stroke Saturday while vacationing in Gatlinburg, Tenn. He was taken
to the University of Tennessee Medical Center for treatment, then
transported by helicopter to Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati.
   ``He arrived conscious and in good spirits,'' spokeswoman Kathy
Clark said. She said the surgery, scheduled for Monday, is expected
to last about 5{ hours.
   ``He has an excellent medical history, and they're anticipating
everything will go smoothly,'' Ms. Clark said.
   An aneurism is a sac formed by the enlargement of a weakened
blood vessel wall.
   Pilarczyk was listed in serious condition Sunday night.
   Archdiocese spokesman Ray George said Pilarczyk recognized
friends and family members who visited him at the Tennessee
hospital. Pilarczyk had been vacationing about a week when he
became ill.

   Increased gasoline demand for summer travel
pushed up prices an average of 2 cents a gallon during the past two
weeks, an analyst said Sunday.
   While demand was the major factor, retailers also had been
absorbing wholesale increases for about a month, said Trilby
Lundberg, who oversees the twice monthly Lundberg Survey.
   The average price including taxes for all grades of self- and
full-serve gasoline at the 12,000 outlets surveyed nationwide was
$1.0168 at the end of last week, Ms. Lundberg said.
   She predicted motorists may face further increases because
during the latest survey period, July 8 to July 22, wholesale
prices again increased more than retail prices.
   The survey found that the average price of gasoline at
self-service stations, which account for eight of every 10 gallons
of gasoline sold, was 92.79 cents a gallon for regular unleaded;
$1.077 for premium unleaded and 89.41 cents a gallon for regular
leaded.
   At full-serve pumps, the average price was $1.2078 a gallon for
regular unleaded; $1.3057 for premium unleaded; and $1.1647 for
regular unleaded.

   Leaders of the warring factions in
Cambodia opened informal talks Monday at the presidential palace in
Bogor and Indonesian officials called it a ``coffee morning.''
   No name plates or other identification labels were on the
circular table where delegates from Cambodia and an alliance of
Cambodian resistance groups began negotiations in Bogor, 40 miles
south of Jakarta, to end the bloody conflict.
   One of the rebel leaders on Sunday urged the other delegates to
put aside politics, and then he knelt in prayer before three
Buddhist monks.
   ``I believe strongly in this meeting as the best chance for a
solution to the Cambodian problem,'' Son Sann, a former Cambodian
premier, told reporters at the airport following his arrival.
   The peace talks, hosted by Indonesia, mark the first time the
rebels have sat down face-to-face with government leaders since
Vietnam invaded Cambodia nearly 10 years ago.
   Son Sann said the talks represented a chance for the parties
involved ``not to think about political things, but only one thing:
To put an end to the suffering of the Cambodian people. If everyone
thinks about that, then we will have good results.''
   Since 1970, Cambodia has suffered a devastating five-year civil
war, a reign of terror by the Chinese-backed communist Khmer Rouge
from 1975 to 1978, a 1978 Vietnamese invasion and a continuing
guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-backed government. Millions of
people have been killed in the nation's turmoil.
   The heads of Cambodia's three rebel factions arrived Sunday in
Indonesia.
   If the talk's make progress, officials from Vietnam, Laos and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations were to join in
Wednesday.
   The informal, phased nature of the talks has been labeled
``cocktail party'' diplomacy.
   Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, greeted the heads of
the three guerrilla groups on Sunday. They were Son Sann, head of
the Khmer People's National Liberation Front; Khieu Samphan of the
Khmer Rouge, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh. He was representing his
father, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who quit the resistance leadership
but remains perhaps the most popular figure in Cambodia.
   Their adversaries _ Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach
and the prime minister of Cambodia's government, Hun Sen _ arrived
in Jakarta Saturday.
   Vietnam has announced it will withdraw 50,000 troops, or about
half its force in Cambodia, this year and the rest by early 1990.
   Son Sann said Sunday that he had asked Alatas and Malaysia's
prime minister, Mahathir Mohammed, to ask people to pray for
success of the talks in all mosques in their Moslem nations. He
said he had also asked Pope John Paul II to encourage prayers in
Roman Catholic churches worldwide.
   He then knelt on the floor of the airport's VIP lounge, closed
his eyes, and folded his hands to his forehead in prayer before
three Buddhist monks, who chanted blessings. The monks came from
the United States, Canada and France to bless participants in the
talks.
   Though Son Sann and Sihanouk are allied with the communist Khmer
Rouge in a resistance coalition, they strongly distrust the group
because it killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled
Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnam invaded.
   Sihanouk resigned as president of the coalition earlier this
month because he said Khmer Rouge forces were killing his men.
   The prince, who ruled Cambodia for three decades, arrived
Saturday in Jakarta as a guest of Indonesian President Suharto, but
he said he would not attend the talks personally.
   In a recent interview with Indonesian media, Alatas said all
factions agreed that Sihanouk would lead a future Cambodia.

<HEAD>Tumultuous Year Continues At Polaroid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp., which first gave the
world instant snapshots more than half a century ago, has been
thrust into the public eye in 1988 by a series of high-stakes
events that portend significant changes for the company.
   On Wall Street, analysts and arbitragers are fascinated by the
possibility of an all-out takeover battle for Polaroid, prompted by
a hostile bid last week from a California-based investment group
led by an heir to the Disney entertainment empire.
   In the courts, the outcome of a $5.7 billion patent infringement
suit against rival Eastman Kodak Co. could have a major impact on
Polaroid stock prices.
   And in its headquarters along the Charles River, company
officials are trimming the work force while preparing to challenge
Kodak and other film manufacturers with the worldwide introduction
of conventional color film.
   Polaroid, with a reputation for extravagant research and
uninspired marketing, now faces quick and important decisions.
   ``We're all waiting to see what happens,'' said Eugene Glazer,
an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``Polaroid is
hot right now.''
   Polaroid's tumultuous year began dramatically in late February
with its $5.7 billion damage claim in the U.S. District Court
patent suit.
   Polaroid claims it lost $3.2 billion in sales and $2.5 billion
in business opportunities after Kodak entered the instant camera
field in 1976.
   U.S. District Court Judge Rya Zobel ruled in 1985 that Kodak
violated seven Polaroid patents and ordered the Rochester,
N.Y.-based company to halt production of the instant film and
camera. Zobel last month withdrew from the 12-year-old case due to
family holdings of Kodak stock. The damages portion of the case is
scheduled to be heard in January with a new judge presiding.
   Although Kodak termed the damage claim ``ludicrous and
ridiculously inflated,'' Polaroid stock has risen sharply from the
mid-$20 range in anticipation of a decision in Polaroid's favor.
   Polaroid closed at $40.75 a share Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, largely because of takeover talk.
   The company would welcome any award _ even the $1 billion to $2
billion many analysts predict _ following several years of
lackluster performance. Polaroid camera sales have dropped nearly
50 percent from a high of 7.5 million in 1978, and the public has
poorly received several new products, such as video film.
   Polaroid was formed in 1937 by Dr. Edwin Land Jr. to develop and
manufacture a synthetic light polarizing material he developed.
Polaroid produced instant color photography in 1963 and made its
most stunning achievement in 1972 with the release of the SX-70
system, which produced instant pictures outside the camera.
   It has made ventures in other market areas but with nowhere near
the success of its breakthroughs in instant photography.
   Amid takeover rumors, the company on July 12 announced a
reorganization plan highlighted by 500 to 800 layoffs and its entry
into the $7 billion-a-year conventional film market.
   Company officials would not announce when the new film will be
available outside Spain and Portugal, where it has been sold for
two years in direct competition with industry leaders Kodak,
Agfa-Gevaert and Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.
   Meanwhile, the layoffs mark the latest in a decade-long
reduction in Polaroid's work force, which has declined from more
than 20,000 in 1978 to nearly 13,000. A company statement said most
employees could select either early retirement or a severance plan
that provided up to one year's salary.
   In addition, the company issued 10 million new shares into an
employee stock ownership plan and launched a $300 million company
stock repurchase effort. The move was interpreted as an effort to
discourage takeover attempts.
   But less than a week later, Shamrock Holdings Inc., a television
and radio concern based in Burbank, Calif., made a $40-per-share
bid for Polaroid and filed suit in Delaware seeking to cancel the
employee stock purchase plan.
   Shamrock, owned by the family of Roy E. Disney, a Walt Disney
Co. director and nephew of the famous animator, disclosed on July
20 it had acquired 4.93 million Polaroid shares as of May 11.
   Its takeover bid values the company at about $2.88 billion if
all 71.9 million shares remain outstanding. However, Shamrock has
indicated it might not proceed unless it manages to get the recent
10 million-share issue rolled back. In that case, the implied value
of the bid would be $2.48 billion.
   Because Shamrock already owns a large block, its cost to buy the
rest would be $2.28 billion, assuming defeat of the share issue, or
$2.68 billion if the share issue is not defeated.
   According to Shamrock documents, Polaroid President and Chief
Executive Officer I. MacAllister Booth refused to meet with Disney
earlier this year to discuss company strategies. Booth eventually
consented to a July 13 meeting on condition that Shamrock would not
acquire additional Polaroid stock, and Polaroid in turn take no
action which might hurt Shamrock's investment.
   The meeting was not held in the wake of Polaroid's
reorganization announcement, which Shamrock termed a ``clear
breach'' of its agreement with Polaroid. The company said it would
convene directors Tuesday to discuss the Shamrock bid.
   Some analysts are skeptical the 10-year-old Shamrock group could
put together a deal of such magnitude.
   Earlier this year, Shamrock failed in a $92 million bid for
Wherehouse Entertainment, a California video rental and music
company. Shamrock owns Music Plus, a 54-store music and video
retail chain in the Los Angeles area, in addition to three
television stations and 14 radio stations.
   ``As far as I'm concerned it's a very shaky bid,'' said Glazer.
``There seems to be too many conditions attatched to the offer
...It just seems out of their league.''
   William Relyea, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York, said Shamrock could have a major impact on investors if it
could arrange a tender offer at a lower price with a promise to
distribute any dividends to shareholders following resolution of
the Kodak suit.
   ``Say, for example, they got Polaroid for $30 a share,'' said
Relyea. ``Well, that would set the damage award at about $10 a
share, when right now no one can really say what effect it will
have.''
   The offer by Shamrock also could lure other suitors, hostile or
friendly, into the bidding for Polaroid, analysts say.

   Control Data Corp., faced with
slower-than-expected U.S. sales of mainframe computers, plans to
shut down several plants temporarily and idle 7 percent of its work
force the last week in August.
   The move will affect about 2,000 workers in St. Louis Park,
Plymouth and Arden Hills and about 500 employees in Sunnyvale,
Calif., and Kansas City, Mo., said Tom Charland, a spokesman for
the Computer Products Division, which makes mainframe computers.
   Employees will have a choice of taking accrued paid vacation
during that week, or going without pay, Charland said Friday. Other
divisions will not be affected by the shutdown, he said.
   The move will help consolidate vacation expenses in the third
quarter, which will improve cash flow in the fourth quarter ``when
we want to do well,' Charland said. ``It's hard to say what that
means, because so much of our business is concentrated at the end
of the year.''
   Control Data has closed some of its operations temporarily
before, but this is the first time it has done so this year,
Charland said. The most recent shutdown occurred last year in the
Government Systems Group, which makes military computers, he said.

<HEAD>Hunts Offer Debt Settlement For Placid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hunt brothers' Texas oil operation has offered
to pay $803.5 million to settle the final step in a bitter two-year
court battle between Hunt companies and banks that lent them $1.5
billion, according to company officials.
   The offer by Placid Oil Co., which is owned by Hunt trust
estates, includes cash repayments of $663.5 million over the next
two months. The Hunts also would to pay the banks $140 million from
Placid production revenues during the next seven years, company
officials said Saturday.
   The plan, which is subject to approval by federal bankruptcy
court, Internal Revenue Service and major creditor groups, nearly
would complete the settlement of the case and would remove Placid
from bankruptcy protection.
   It also would leave the billionaire Hunt brothers with only
pieces of the vast petroleum-based empire amassed by their father,
Dallas wildcatter H.L. Hunt.
   Late in June, the Hunt trusts and bank creditors agreed on a
settlement to resolve issues surrounding some $760 million in loans
to their Penrod Drilling Co.
   Penrod, the world's biggest independent offshore oil-drilling
company, and Placid Oil sued 23 of their lenders for fraud and
misrepresentation in 1986 after defaulting on $1.5 billion in bank
loans. Two of the banks since have been dropped from the case.
   The suit sought $14 million in damages, alleging the banks
conspired to drive Penrod and Placid out of business by forcing
them to agree to an unreasonable payment schedule while offering
their competitors more favorable terms.
   In August 1986, the trust estates of William Herbert Hunt,
Nelson Bunker Hunt and Lamar Hunt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection for the trust partnership that owns Penrod Drilling.
   The reorganization plan proposed for Placid calls for sale of
the Hunt brothers' interests in the 60-story Thanksgiving Tower, a
downtown Dallas office building, and disposal of Hunt production
properties in Louisiana, transactions that are completed or pending.
   ``It depends on a number of large transactions,'' Hunt attorney
Henry Simon said of the proposal.
   Simon said one obstacle to conclusion of the settlement was the
negotiation under way in the Netherlands for a loan of about $245
million, to be secured by Placid International Oil, the Hunts'
North Sea unit.
   The Hunts already have paid $213.5 million of the proposed
$663.5 million cash settlement from funds raised through Placid
operations, primarily the North Sea unit, as part of cash
collateral agreements with bank lenders, said Simon.
   Another $150 million was raised through sale of the Hunts' Black
Lake oil and gas fields in Louisiana, he said.
   The brothers also plan to apply to the settlement their share of
the $50 million in proceeds expected from pending sale of an 80
percent interest in Thanksgiving Tower. The planned sale of the
building to Bear, Stearns & Co., a New York investment banking
firm, should be complete by mid-August, said Simon.
   He said completion of the loan agreement associated with the
North Sea assets could come by early September but was dependent on
negotiations under way with mortgage lenders who must approve the
transaction.
   The plan would leave the Hunts with Placid's successful North
Sea operations and prospects in the Green Canyon sector of the Gulf
of Mexico.
   Under the proposal to resolve the Penrod loans, bank creditors
would receive a $50 million payment and a $500 million secured note
from Penrod Drilling, plus a 50 percent interest in the company if
the Hunts fail to meet certain debt repayment deadlines.
   Some trust real estate will be transferred to the banks, subject
to a $200 million purchase option.
   The Penrod plan also must be approved by federal bankruptcy
court.
